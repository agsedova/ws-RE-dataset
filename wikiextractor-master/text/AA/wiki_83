Caemi means \"Companhia Auxiliar de Empresas de Mineração\".\n\nThe company owned iron ore mines in the so-called \"Iron Quadrangle\" region of the state of Minas Gerais, and kaolin mines in the northern states of Amapá and Pará. The company also owned a stake in MRS Logística, which owns a railway network in southeastern Brazil. Caemi's stock was traded on Bovespa.\n\nCaemi started MBR in a partnership with M. A. Hanna Company in 1965. MBR since 1971 had been the second biggest iron ore producer in Brazil, mining in 2005 over 50 million tonnes of iron ore or around 25% of Brazilian production. \n\nMBR until Vale acquired 100% of Caemi's capital in 2006 was owned by two companies: Caemi and \"EBM\" (Empreendimentos Brasileiros de Mineração S.A.). Caemi had a 49% stake at MBR while \"EBM\" owned the other 51% of the company. The problem is that Caemi also owned 70.1% of \"EBM\", this fact brings Caemi's total stake at MBR to 84.75%. Caemi's 84.75% participation at MBR is recognized at the company's 2005 Annual Report, which was Caemi's last.\n\n\"EBM\", besides Caemi had two other investors:\n\nAfter Vale bought 100% of Caemi, Vale's stake at MBR reached 89.8%, that's because Vale became the owner of Caemi's 84.75% stake at MBR and Vale already indirectly owned 5.05% of MBR through its 9.9% stake at \"EBM\".\n\nThis meant that Vale had only to acquire the remaining 20% of \"EBM\" at the hands of the japanese investors in order to become owner of 100% of MBR. This objective was achieved on May 2007 when Vale bought for $231 million 6.25% of \"EBM\" from the Japanese investors and simultaneously leased the 13.75% left from the japanese group in exchange for a down payment of $60.5 million and annual fee of $48.1 million for the next 30 years. Vale now owns 100% of MBR.\n\nThe mining company Vale bought between 2001 and 2006 100% of Caemi's capital for a total cost of $3.2 billion.\n\nBack in 2001 Vale bought for $278.7 million 16.82% of Caemi's capital then in 2003 Vale purchased Mitsui's participation on Caemi for $426.4 million, raising Vale's participation to 60.2% of Caemi's total capital.\n\nFinally on 31 March 2006 Vale purchased the remaining 39.8% of Caemi's capital in a stock swap deal worth $2.5 billion. In May the company's shares stopped being negotiated at Bovespa and then in December Caemi was merged into Vale and ceased to exist.\n"}

He has been described by NBC as \"the class clown\". He lives with his longtime girlfriend and their two young children.\n\nBrinkley disliked wearing headgear and hated the amateur point scoring system - so he turned professional quickly. His dream is to fight the legendary boxer Oscar De La Hoya.\nHe also has a tattoo which is of a scorpion.\n\nIn 2004, he entered reality tv show The Contender, and was placed on the West Coast Team. Having seen his teammate Gomez beat the highest-ranked boxer in the competition (Manfredo), he took on the second-highest ranked, Jonathan Reid, and won. His Quarter Final fight saw him having to lose a pounds in an hour to make the weight restriction against Anthony Bonsante, but he won anyway - getting into the semi-finals, albeit in a battered and bruised state. He lost his semi-final against the eventual winner Sergio Mora, and went on to lose the 3rd Place Fight to Alfonso Gomez in a good action fight.\n\nOn May 10, 2006 Brinkley fought the undefeated Joey Spina.

Brinkley stopped Griffin in the 11th round at the Silver Legacy Reno in Reno, Nevada. Brinkley won the vacant WBC USNBC Super Middleweight title with the victory.\n\nOn February 14, 2009, Brinkley fought longtime rival Joey Gilbert at The Reno Events Center in Reno, NV. Brinkley scored a knockdown in the fifth round with a right cross that severely broke Gilbert’s nose. Gilbert spent most of the early portion of the fight trying to use movement to frustrate Brinkley, but did not add punches with that movement so Brinkley easily won most of the early rounds. Later in the fight Gilbert started to hold his ground more and made the fight more competitive, but Brinkley still had the upper hand in most of their exchanges. Brinkley went on to win the match via a wide unanimous decision.\n\nBrinkley fought Mike Paschall on July 10, 2009 and won by unanimous decision.\n\nOn January 29, 2010, Brinkley fought Curtis \"Showtime\" Stevens in Reno as part of ESPN2's Friday Night Fights. The bout was an IBF Title Eliminator bout giving the winner an IBF ranking of No. 2. Stevens claimed that Brinkley would not last fifty seconds in the ring with him beforehand, and started the fight aggressively, landing several hard hooks to Brinkley's face in the 1st round, causing swelling over Jesse's right eye very early, but Brinkley weathered the initial storm of Stevens, and outboxed/outfought him in an entertaining fight, dropping Stevens in the 6th and 12th rounds en route to a wide decision win, 117-109, 118-108, 119-107.\n\nOn October 15, 2010 Brinkley fought against the IBF Super Middleweight champion Lucian Bute in Montreal, Canada. Brinkley was knocked down twice in rounds five and eight before being stopped in the ninth round.\n\nOn April 29, 2011 Brinkley fought Peter Quillin in Reno, Nevada, for the vacant United States Boxing Organisation Super Middleweight Championship.

Gilbert graduated from the University of Nevada with a Bachelor of Arts Degree, double majoring in English Literature and Political Science, with an emphasis on foreign affairs and minored in Italian studies. Gilbert spent 6 months living, training and traveling in northern Europe during the summer and fall of 1998 through a study abroad program based in Torino, Italy.\n\nGilbert was a collegiate fighter at the University of Nevada, National Champion from 1998 through 2000 (named outstanding boxer all 3 years), a four-time Regional Champion, a four-time All American, and was the Nevada State Golden Gloves Super Middleweight Champion in 2000.\n\nGilbert earned his J.D. degree from Thomas Jefferson Law School in San Diego, California, and passed the Nevada bar exam in 2004. He has practiced law since that time in numerous areas; however, he focuses on criminal and civil trial practice and specific areas of sports and entertainment law. His law firm, Joey Gilbert & Associates, focuses on many aspects of criminal defense including personal injury, DUI defense, workers compensation, criminal law and immigration law.\n\nGilbert began boxing as an amateur at the University of Nevada, Reno. During his time at the University of Nevada, Gilbert was a three-time National Champion, a four-time Regional Champion, a four-time All American, and was the Nevada State Golden Gloves Super Middleweight Champion in 2000. He finished his amateur career with a record of 27-1.\n\nIn 2004, Gilbert was cast on NBC's reality TV show The Contender. He was placed on the West Coast Team and beat Jimmy Lange in the first round of this competition. He then had his friend turned rival Jesse Brinkley place him in a fight against Peter Manfredo in the Quarter Finals, which he lost in a divided decision. The fight was stopped in the fifth round due to an accidental head-butt from his opponent.\n\nAfter \"The Contender\", Gilbert won a 6 round unanimous decision in the super middleweight division against James North on the undercard of the Jeff Lacy vs. Scott Pemberton card. Gilbert won the rematch with Jimmy Lange at the Patriot Center in Fairfax, VA for the vacant middleweight NABO title on February 18 and won the WBC-USNBC middleweight title shortly after.\n\nOn September 21, 2007, Gilbert scored a first round knockout over Charles Howe, however, the ruling was later changed to a no-decision.\n\nOn February 14, 2009, Gilbert challenged former rival Jesse Brinkley for the WBC USNBC super middleweight title, but was defeated by unanimous decision.\n\nAfter suffering a 6th round technical knockout loss to former IBF light middleweight champion, Kassim Ouma, Gilbert retired from professional boxing in 2010 and now practices criminal defense and personal injury law in Reno, NV.\n\nGilbert has developed a foundation that focuses on a comprehensive strategic plan to help children and young adults develop good judgment, self-confidence, and motivation. This foundation is called Children's Leadership & Awareness Initiative. The Children's Leadership & Awareness Initiative was designed specifically to assist children and young adults in developing and implementing their own successful “Operating Systems.” Gilbert has worked with children of all ages and backgrounds. Through his extensive interaction with children, Gilbert recognized that most young people today have three significant problems: (1) a lack of good judgment, (2) a lack of self-confidence, and (3) a lack of motivation or will power. One does not need endless statistics or university studies (although there are many available) to know that there is an intimate connection between an individual's judgment, confidence, motivation, and his or her success in life. Providing children and young adults with a program to help develop these characteristics (“Operating System”) is a core purpose of The Joey Gilbert Foundation.\n\nThis Foundation has increasingly developed into the Get Active Foundation that includes all of the above aspects and focuses on the aspects of young people's lives including: community involvement, fitness, personal confidence, drug awareness and volunteering.\n\n"}

Later he was chosen as the head of linguistics faculty at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) (1883–1893). Between 1894 and 1898 he occupied the same post at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków only to be appointed to St. Petersburg, where he continued to refine his theory of phonetic alternations. After Poland regained independence in 1918, he returned to Warsaw, where he formed the core of the linguistics faculty of the University of Warsaw. From 1887 he held a permanent seat in the Polish Academy of Skills and from 1897 he was a member of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In 1925 he was one of the co-founders of the Polish Linguistic Society.\n\nHis work had a major impact on 20th-century linguistic theory, and it served as a foundation for several schools of phonology. He was an early champion of synchronic linguistics, the study of contemporary spoken languages, which he developed contemporaneously with the structuralist linguistic theory of Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure. Among the most notable of his achievements is the distinction between statics and dynamics of languages and between a \"language\" (an abstract group of elements) and \"speech\" (its implementation by individuals) – compare Saussure's concepts of \"langue\" and \"parole\". Together with his students, Mikołaj Kruszewski and Lev Shcherba, Baudouin de Courtenay also shaped the modern usage of the term phoneme (Baudouin de Courtenay 1876–77 and Baudouin de Courtenay 1894), which had been coined in 1873 by the French linguist A. Dufriche-Desgenettes who proposed it as a one-word equivalent for the German \"Sprachlaut\". His work on the theory of phonetic alternations may have had an influence on the work of Ferdinand de Saussure according to E. F. K. Koerner.\n\nThree major schools of 20th-century phonology arose directly from his distinction between \"physiophonetic\" (phonological) and \"psychophonetic\" (morphophonological) alternations: the Leningrad school of phonology, the Moscow school of phonology, and the Prague school of phonology. All three schools developed different positions on the nature of Baudouin's alternational dichotomy. The Prague School was best known outside the field of Slavic linguistics. Throughout his life he published hundreds of scientific works in Polish, Russian, Czech, Slovenian, Italian, French and German.\n\nApart from his scientific work, Baudouin de Courtenay was also a strong supporter of the national revival of various national minority and ethnic groups. In 1915 he was arrested by the Okhrana, the Russian secret service, for publishing a brochure on the autonomy of peoples under Russian rule. He spent three months in prison, but was released. In 1922, without his knowledge, he was proposed by the national minorities of Poland as a presidential candidate, but was defeated in the third round of voting in the Polish parliament and eventually Gabriel Narutowicz was chosen. He was also an active Esperantist and president of the Polish Esperanto Association.\n\nIn 1927 he formally withdrew from the Roman Catholic Church without joining any other religious denomination. He died in Warsaw. He is buried at the Protestant Reformed Cemetery in Warsaw with the epitaph “He sought truth and justice\".\n\nHis daughter, Cezaria Baudouin de Courtenay Ehrenkreutz Jędrzejewiczowa was one of the founders of the Polish school of ethnology and anthropology as well as a professor at the universities of Vilnius and Warsaw.\n\nHe appears as a character in Joseph Skibell's 2010 novel, \"A Curable Romantic\".\n\nBaudouin de Courtenay was the editor of the 3rd (1903–1909) and 4th (1912–1914) editions of the \"Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language\" compiled by Russian lexicographer Vladimir Dahl (1801–1872).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1891747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891747", "title": "Coma (band)", "text": "Coma (band)\n\nComa is a Polish rock band which was founded in June 1998 in Łódź. It is one of the most successful rock bands on the Polish music scene of the last decade. As of 2013, the band has released four Polish-language studio albums (three of which have topped the Polish sales chart OLiS), two English-language studio albums, and two live albums.\n\nThe name \"Coma\" was chosen at random: the band members tossed a coin to decide on it, as they had an appointment for an interview with Radio Łódź.\n\nDuring their first rehearsals they named the band Voo Doo Art, but it didn't catch on. The band started off with Dominik Witczak on guitar and Tomasz Stasiak on drums. They had played together earlier in a band enigmatically called Ozoz. After Ozoz had fallen apart, Witczak and Stasiak tried to form a band which would play music inspired by Illusion, Pearl Jam, Led Zeppelin, etc. Yet finding a bass player turned out to be problematic. However hard they tried, they didn't get along with any of the candidates for this honourable post. They had to wait quite a long time for God to send them Rafał Matuszak, who apart from being a pretty good musician and partygoer, turned out to live 300m from Witczak. The three guys were fascinated with one another. They had rehearsals a few times a week. Dominik, Tomasz and Rafał made up their minds to rock together until their dying day, and then they cut their veins and... sealed their decision with blood.\n\nIn this way the hybrid was created and functioned under the name \"Voo Doo Art\". The next to join the band was Wojciech Grenda, whom Dominik and Tomasz knew from Ozoz. After they welcomed him warmly, their friendship developed very quickly. To complete the picture, the members needed someone who could sing. But here their expectations were sky high. Stasiak, Witczak and Grenda had once played with Agnieszka Unczur, a person who sung better than most of the vocalists you could hear on the radio. The gentlemen, obsessed with her superb voice, could only choose someone who sung at least as well as she did, or better. God showed mercy one more time.\n\nMatuszak, along with Witczak, apart from playing in Voo Doo Art performed with another band - De Ja Vi (guitar+bass+3 girls on vocals). De Ja Vi's rehearsals took place in the building owned by scout troop where one person, a scout, appeared very often. It was Piotr Rogucki. They were bound to meet. Our musicians thought that it would be worth trying to adopt the young talented vocalist. Here we skip the fact that these three gentlemen knew each other from technical college. Most probably it didn't occur to them then that they would ever play in one band.\nAfter the first rehearsal with Piotr, the choice proved to be the best possible. Long months of struggling with compositions followed. The guys drank many different alcoholic beverages that helped to tighten cooperation within the band. Everything seemed to be heading in a good direction. And suddenly, after years of plenty, a very unpleasant \"situation\" took place. As a result, Wojciech Grenda was dismissed from the band. Fortunately his replacement was found very quickly. Marcin Kobza joined the band. He was known in Łodź at that time as an excellent guitarist and played with groups such as Pig Bit or Second Hand. He fit in perfectly.\n\nTheir first achievement was a single Skaczemy / Pasażer. In the end of 2003 they signed with BMG Poland which allowed them to record their first album \"Pierwsze wyjście z mroku (First emergence from darkness)\". The recording sessions started in November and lasted until January 2004. Even though it may sound unbelievable, all instruments were recorded between 12 and 18 November in Łodź and during the last three days of January in Gdańsk. A throat infection stopped Piotr from recording vocals until December. His sessions took place in Łódź and Gdańsk. Before the release of their first longplay album they gained popularity on supports with Kazik, T.Love, Sweet Noise and Acid Drinkers. People from the business also appreciated \"Pierwsze Wyjście Z Mroku\" awarding it with a Fryderyk statuette for Album of the Year - Rock.\n\nIn 2005 during a break in the tour, the band started to work on some new material, which was later tried out live. On May 29, 2006 Coma released their second album \"Zaprzepaszczone siły wielkiej armii świętych znaków\" (The Wasted Forces Of Great Army Of Holy Seals). And as was the case with the first record, fans appreciated the album, awarding it with the title of Antyradio's Album of the Year. During the 13th Woodstock Festival the band received a Złoty Bączek statuette - awarded by the audience. The community of Polish musicians, music journalists and music critics once again honoured Coma with Fryderyk awards. That time the band won two of them for Album of the Year Rock/metal and Group of the Year.\n\nOn June 13, 2007 they gave a concert as a support for Linkin Park and Pearl Jam in Chorzów and on August 12, 2007 as a support for Tool and Dir En Grey during Metal Hammer Festival.\n\nLater the same year, after a few years on tour the band decided to hide in the mountains, in a place called \"Muzyczna Owczarnia\" in Jaworki. There in the care of the wonderful family of the owner of the place, in the peaceful silence of the Pieniny Mountains they started to work on the material for their third album. When they returned to Łódź they continued polishing the material during rehearsals. In spring 2008 Adam Marszałkowski, known from another band from Łódź - Normalsi, took place of Tomasz Stasiak on drums and participated actively in the composition of new tracks. Between April and September 2008, all of the compositions were recorded, and they were released as \"Hipertrofia\" on 10 November 2008. The album soon gained the Platinum Record status and the band went on tour again.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the third book featuring his private eye Lew Archer.\n\nMiddle-aged Mrs. Samuel Lawrence gives Lew Archer 50 dollars for one day of his time to find her daughter Galatea (a.k.a. Galley) who has been missing since just before Christmas. Archer soon discovers she was married to a small-time mobster named Joe Tarantine. Starting the investigation in the most likely place, with Tarantine's brother, Mario, Lew finds the man in the hospital after a severe beating that has left him almost unrecognizable. And shortly after that, a big-time mobster offers him five thousand to find Tarantine. The investigation quickly gains a body count and Lew is constantly drawn from Los Angeles to Pacific Point (a fictionalized version of La Jolla ), Palm Springs, San Francisco, and back again, trying to tie together details that seem as random as they are violent. As the bodies pile up, so does Archer's confusion, but he remains undeterred by the situation, relying on his well-honed instinct for deviant behavior and the venal intentions of others. Still, the bodies accumulate at an alarming rate, a handsome part-time actor found dead in his apartment, a newlywed husband on the lam, a boat piled on the rocks, fast-talking women, everybody with a handout or hidden agenda.\n\nThis book introduces the second of two cities Ross invented and was to use commonly in his work, Pacific Point, located south of Los Angeles.\n\nAnthony Boucher described it as: \"The best novel in the tough tradition I've read since \"Farewell, My Lovely\" and possibly since \"The Maltese Falcon\".\"\n\nDick Lochte wrote: \"I'm not sure why I prefer \"The Way Some People Die\" to\" The Moving Target\", the first book in the series, or\" The Galton Case\", in which Macdonald distances himself from the influence of Chandler. I just like the nastiness of the plot and the sharpness of the dialogue.\"\n"}

In addition to their 1997 hit song \"Takie tango\", they are perhaps best known for their rock ballads, such as \"Jolka, Jolka pamiętasz\" and \"Za ostatni grosz\" that are often quoted as some of the best songs of Polish rock.\n\nThe band was started in 1969 with jam sessions by Krzysztof Cugowski (vocals), Krzysztof Brozi (lead guitar), Janusz Pędzisz (bass guitar) and Jacek Grün (drums). They performed cover versions of John Mayall, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin in local venues and disbanded after making a few radio recordings and several concerts.\n\nIn 1970 Cugowski joined a band Stowarzyszenie Cnót Wszelakich, led by his school mate Romuald Lipko. Soon the band was renamed to Budka Suflera. After few member changes the band finally made in March 1974 to be their first major recording, \"Sen o dolinie\" as the Polish cover of Bill Withers' \"Ain't No Sunshine\". The song received much airplay, which resulted in an offer from Polskie Nagrania record label, as well as numerous concert proposals.\n\nIn autumn 1974 the next song is recorded, \"Cień wielkiej góry\", inspired by death of two Polish mountaineers (Zbigniew Stepek and Andrzej Grzązek) in the Himalayas in 1973. It instantly became a hit and appeared on many compilations and live albums since then. The band also recorded \"Lubię ten stary obraz\" in November 1974 and \"Memu miastu na do widzenia\" in the beginning of 1975. The drummer Zbigniew Zieliński was replaced by Tomasz Zeliszewski soon after this.\n\nThe first album, entitled \"Cień wielkiej góry\" after its first track, was released in 1975. This record saw some contributions from Czesław Niemen, who played his Moog synthesizer psychedelic parts in a majestic rock suite called \"Szalony koń\". Clocking over 19 minutes, this track took a whole B-side of the long play.\n\nThe radio hit \"Sen o dolinie\" as well as \"Memu miastu na do widzenia\" were not placed on the album. The first one was rejected by the record label, because it was a cover of a foreign artist and the latter was written by Lipko solely (there was a sort of deal among the band members, they wanted only songs written by Cugowski and Lipko together on the first album).\n\nThe release became a success and the band went on a tour to East Germany. There, few German versions of band's greatest hits were recorded. There were plans to release an album in Germany, but they failed as Cugowski missed a recording session. A second attempt failed, too, because of the exhausting tour that ended just before.\n\nIn 1976 another band's record, named \"Przechodniem byłem między wami\" was released. It did not repeat the success of its predecessor. After the release, Cugowski decided to leave the band and start a solo career. He was replaced by Stanisław Wenglorz, an ex-singer of Skaldowie. He has only appeared on few records (\"Rozmowa\", \"Kula nocnego światła\", \"Ślady na piasku\", \"Życiowy numer\"), then unreleased and quit soon after.

He was appointed the twenty-second Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1973.\n\nHoffman was born in New York City.\n\nDuring World War II, he served in the Army Air Corps, where he served stateside as a technical writer and as the editor of an aeronautical research journal, experiences detailed in his memoir \"Zone of the Interior.\" He was educated at Columbia University, earning a B.A. (1947), an M.A. (1949), and a Ph.D. (1956). He was a member of the Boar's Head Society there.\n\nIn 1954, Hoffman published his first collection of poetry, \"An Armada of Thirty Whales.\" This collection was chosen by W. H. Auden as part of the Yale Series of Younger Poets, and Auden commended it in his introduction as \"providing a new direction for nature poetry in the post-Wordsworthian world.\" He has since published ten additional collections of poetry, a memoir, and seven volumes of criticism. Reviewing \"Beyond Silence\" in \"The New York Times Book Review\" in 2003, Eric McHenry found Hoffman a poet of remarkable consistency, \"no less joyful or engaged at 80 than he was at 25.\"\n\nHoffman has taught at Columbia University, Swarthmore College, and the University of Pennsylvania. He retired from the latter as Felix Schelling Professor of English Emeritus, and its Philomathean Society in 1996 published an anthology of poetry in honor of his efforts to bring contemporary poets to give readings in their halls.

The cover of their first album, \"Z partyjnym pozdrowieniem\" (Polish for \"With a Party Greeting\"), was an image of Vladimir Lenin with a Mohawk hairstyle. The title of their second album, \"Nie wierzcie elektrykom\" (\"Don't Trust Electricians\") refers to the Polish president Lech Wałęsa, an electrician by profession. Their fourth album cover, \"Wojna plemników\" (\"War of Spermatozoons\") featured a nun drying condoms on a clothes line. In May 1999, the band leader Krzysztof Skiba was charged with indecent exposure and fined the equivalent of US$308 for mooning the Polish prime minister Jerzy Buzek during a festival in February 1999.\n\nThe members of Big Cyc met at the University of Łódź. Jędrzejak played guitar in a student reggae band \"Rokosz\" (laureate of the Golden Ten during the Jarocin Festival), Skiba performed in student theatre \"Pstrąg\" and in many school cabarets, also co-creating street happenings named “The Orange Alternative”. In 1988 \"Rokosz\" broke up, and Jędrzejak wanted to create a new rock band. In this new group such artists as Jarosław Lis (drums), Roman Lechowicz (guitar) and Robert Rejewski (vocal) performed. After some time, Rejewski was replaced by Skiba, who introduced a significant creative potential. Jędrzejak, Lis, Skiba, and Lechowicz became the four of Big Cyc. The members of the band took pseudonyms: Dżej Dżej (Polish for \"JJ\", Jędrzejak), Dżery (Polish for \"Jerry\", Lis), and Piękny Roman (Polish for \"Pretty Roman\", Lechowicz). Skiba remained with his own name. \n\nIn March 1988 the student club and hostel number 2 \"Balbina\" housed the first show of Big Cyc, during a cultural event \"Uroczysta akademia na cześć 75-lecia wynalezienia damskiego biustonosza\" (\"A solemn ceremony to celebrate the 75th anniversary of invention of women's brassiere\"). \nThe nationwide media were invited (among others): Teleexpress, Polish Radio Channel 3), and the cabaret performance was introduced by Piotr Trzaskalski, then a student. \n\nBig Cyc made many successful songs, and in 1990 in a new political environment - after Solidarity's victory and the fall of communism in Poland - they published their first album, \"With the Party’s salutations. 12 hits in lambada-hardcore style\". The album contained hilarious poetics mocking the atmosphere of the late PRL (Polish People's Republic) - which the title and the cover – Lenin’s portrait with punk-like mohawk – bear witness to. The record introduced such well-known compositions as: “Highlander’s Song”, “Western Berlin” (reminiscences from first performances in Western society) and “Ballad about a Sad Skinhead”. It became a hit in Poland, and in short time Big Cyc became well known in the country. Soon after, the band played part in the film named \"The Chemical Weapon\", devoted to life and creative activity of the group, accomplished by independent creators team Garage-Film. \n\nThe following records never caused such sensation as the debut. The authors precisely stigmatized Polish reality, but the music background was weaker and less innovative. \nThe second one, \"Nie wierzcie elektrykom\" (“Don't Believe Electricians”) (1991) carried a prophecy of Lech Wałęsa’s failed presidency, the third \"Miłość, muzyka, mordobicie\" (“Love, music, brawl”) (1992), brought an ironic critic of the musical environment – the Jarocin Festival. The Fourth record, \"Wojna plemników\" (“War of spermatozoon’s”) (1993) was condemned by members of the Catholic party ZChN (National-Christian Union) for moral boldness and provoking cover. \"Nie zapomnisz nigdy\" “You'll never forget” from 1994 was a collection of the greatest hits and some new songs, among which “It’s for you my brother” can be stated as a bands ideological hymn. Subsequent one, \"Golonka, flaki i inne przysmaki\" (“Pig Knuckles, Intestines and Other Delicacies”) (1995) became a sneer of the pseudo-grunge wave and TV-commercial culture (“Hairdresser drama”). \n\nSuccessive songs and albums of Big Cyc took a sarcastic look on the reality of Polish politics and people. Often in ironic manner, the songs expose issues like problems of Polish youth, economic disproportions, drug addiction, or silliness of TV commercials. In 1996, Big Cyc published their seventh album, called \"Z gitarą wśród zwierząt\" (\"With guitar among animals\"), which contains the most famous song in history of the band, \"Makumba\", the stereotypical story of an African student in Poland. In that period the musicians ridicully but bitterly commented their world. They didn’t fail to notice new social phenomena: growing disproportions in wealth, clericalism, corruption, formation of gangs and mafia in Poland, and contrasted it with freedom and neutrality of the young people. Another vocalist, Jarosław Janiszewski from “Bielizna”, appeared in this record, and soon he has created a parallel band, named “Czarno-Czarni”, with the members of Big Cyc.\n\nCelebrating the 9th anniversary in 1997 the band introduced subsequent record, with quite shocking title: \"Pierwsza komunia, drugie śniadanie, trzecia Rzeczpospolita\" (“First Communion, second breakfast, third Rzeczpospolita”), was chosen by the public present. \"Wszyscy święci\" (“All saints”) (1998), based on texts of a dead poet Wieslaw Dymny, proved to be an interesting experiment. Two subsequent records: \"Świat według Kiepskich\" (“World according to Kiepscy”) (2000) and \"Zmień z nami płeć\" (“Change your sex with us”)(2001) were less popular. Nevertheless the texts of do not lose their inner sharpness and validity, they ridiculed pop-folk fashion or the \"dres\" dressing tendency. Świat według Kiepskich, was named after a Polish sitcom of the same name. Recently the politics have returned as the major subject of their satires—the “golden braid” concerning Renata Beger, the member of the Sejm (Polish parliament), the “Mohair berets” a satire on Polish government elected in 2005 and a commentary on vocal older generation in Poland, viewed by many younger people as old-fashioned, or criticizing the president of Belarus—Alexander Lukashenko. With the release of \"Czarne Słońce Narodu\" in 2016 came the song \"Antoni Wzywa do Broni\" (\"Antoni Calls to Arms\"), a song about Antoni Macierewicz, Poland's Minister of National Defence, and Smolensk. It sparked heated arguments across the internet.\n\nThe band has never forgotten about its happening origin. Several times it managed to present, in an unconventional way, the absurd and disabilities of public life. The musicians had chained themselves to radiators in publishing house “Polish Records”, protesting against unwillingness to pay artist’s royalty, they have eaten tax forms (along with politician Janusz Korwin-Mikke) fighting with too high taxes, and they protested under the Minister of Culture’s cabinet unmasking partiality of the financial politics.\n\nSome time ago a new member joined, Piotr Sztajdel Gadak, as keyboard player. Jan Borysewicz, Marek Piekarczyk, Paweł \"Konjo\" Konnak, Wiesława Warszawska and Viganna Papina also have had a chance to perform with Big Cyc.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1891771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891771", "title": "NBA draft lottery", "text": "NBA draft lottery\n\nThe NBA draft lottery is an annual event held by the National Basketball Association (NBA), in which the teams who had missed the playoffs the previous year participate in a lottery process to determine the draft order in the NBA draft. The NBA Draft lottery started in 1985. In the NBA draft, the teams obtain the rights to amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. The lottery winner would get the first selection in the draft. A lottery pick denotes a draft pick whose position is determined through the lottery, while a non-playoff team involved in the process is often called a lottery team.\n\nUnder the current rules, only the top four picks are decided by the lottery, and are chosen from the 14 teams that do not make the playoffs. The team with the worst record, or the team that holds the draft rights of the team with the worst record, has the best chance to obtain a higher draft pick. After the top four positions are selected (from the lottery slotting system), the remainder of the first-round draft order is in inverse order of the win-loss record for the remaining teams, or the teams who originally held the lottery rights if they were traded. The lottery does not determine the draft order in the subsequent rounds of the draft.\n\nBeginning with the 2019 draft, the NBA changed the lottery odds (the bottom three teams will all have an equal 14% chance of winning the top pick) and increased the number of teams selected in the lottery from three to four.\n\nIn the earlier drafts, the teams would draft in reverse order of their win-loss record. However, a special territorial-pick rule allowed a team to draft a player from its local area. If a team decided to use its territorial pick, it forfeited its first-round pick in the draft.\n\nIn 1966, the NBA revamped its draft system, and introduced a coin flip between the worst teams in each conference to determine who would obtain the first overall draft pick. The team who lost the coin flip would get the second pick, and the rest of the first-round picks were determined in reverse order of the win-loss record.\n\nThe coin-flip system gave the worst teams in each conference an equal chance to have the first draft pick, but had a disadvantage in that the two worst teams overall could be in the same conference; in this situation, the second-worst team overall would have no chance of obtaining the first draft pick.\n\nAfter the 1984 coin flip, which was won by the Houston Rockets, the NBA introduced the lottery system to counter the accusations that the Rockets and several other teams were deliberately losing their regular season games in order to secure the worst record and consequently the chance to obtain the first pick. The lottery system involved a random drawing of an envelope from a hopper. Inside each of the envelopes was the name of a non-playoff team. The team whose envelope was drawn first would get the first pick. The process was then repeated until the rest of the lottery picks were determined. In this system, each non-playoff team had an equal chance to obtain the first pick. The rest of the first-round picks were determined in reverse order of the win-loss record.\n\nStarting from 1987, the NBA modified the lottery system so that only the first three picks were determined by the lottery. After the three envelopes were drawn, the remaining non-playoff teams would select in reverse order of their win-loss record. This meant that the team with the worst record could receive no worse than the fourth selection, and the second-worst team could pick no lower than fifth, and so on.\n\nThe New York Knicks were the first winner of the lottery in 1985. They selected Georgetown University standout Patrick Ewing with their first overall pick. However, speculation arose that the NBA had rigged the lottery so that the Knicks would be assured to get the first pick. Even though the envelope system was highly criticized, it was used until 1989 before being replaced by the weighted lottery system in 1990.\n\nIn 1990, the NBA changed the format of the lottery to give the team with the worst record the best chance of landing the first pick. The worst non-playoff team that season would have 11 chances, out of 66, to obtain the first pick. The second worst would have 10 chances, and so on. Similarly to the previous system, the weighted lottery system was also used only to determine the first three picks, while the rest of the teams selected in reverse order of their win-loss records.\n\nDespite the weighted odds, the Orlando Magic managed to win the lottery in 1993 with only one chance to obtain the first pick as it was the best non-playoff team in the previous season. In October 1993, the NBA modified the lottery system to give the team with the worst record a higher chance to win the draft lottery and to decrease the better teams' chances to win. The new system increased the chances of the worst team obtaining the first pick in the draft from 16.7 percent to 25 percent, while decreasing the chances of the best non-playoff team from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent.\n\nIn the new system, 14 numbered table tennis balls were used. Then, a four-number combination from the 14 balls were drawn to determine the lottery winner. Prior to the draft, the NBA assigns 1,000 possible combinations to the non-playoff teams (the 11–12–13–14 combination is ignored and redrawn). The process was then repeated to determine the second and third pick. The table below shows the lottery chances and the probabilities for each team to win the first pick in the weighted lottery system in 1993 and 1994 draft.\n\nIn 2014, the NBA Board of Governors voted on a proposed reform to the lottery. If the proposed changes passed, the four worst teams in the league would have been given identical odds (around 11 percent) at winning the top pick. The fifth team would have a 10 percent chance and the odds would decrease for each team picking after. The proposed changes were designed to disincentivize having the worst record in the league (at the time, the worst team was given a 25% chance at the top pick) and keep teams competitive throughout the entire season.\nThe final vote was 17-13 in favor of the reform, short of the 23 votes in favor required to push the change through.\n\nIn 2016, Dikembe Mutombo made people question the draft's legitimacy when he prematurely tweeted a congratulatory message to the Philadelphia 76ers for receiving the first pick hours before the lottery was conducted. Philadelphia did indeed win the first overall pick. Further questions were raised a bit when the NBA Draft revealed that every spot remained exactly the same as it was before the event took place, which was the first occurrence in draft lottery history. A year later, Lakers executive Magic Johnson raised even further questions about the draft process with him assuring head coach Luke Walton that the Lakers would acquire a top 3 pick for the 2017 NBA draft after an interview Walton had on May 4, 2017, twelve days before the draft lottery commenced and moved up to the second pick.\n\nIn response to teams like the Philadelphia 76ers deliberately seeking high-loss season records in order to improve their draft odds, beginning with the 2019 NBA draft the NBA implemented a new lottery system giving the worst three teams equal odds at the first overall pick and expanding the lottery to the top four picks (up from the top three picks). As with the changes proposed in 2014, these changes were intended to disincentivize high-loss seasons by flattening the odds of getting the top pick and increasing the likelihood of the worst teams having to pick later in the draft.\n\nIn 1995, the NBA had an agreement with the two expansion franchises, the Toronto Raptors and the Vancouver Grizzlies that neither team would be eligible to obtain the first overall pick in the 1996, 1997 and 1998 drafts. The Raptors won the 1996 lottery but were forced to settle for the second pick. Another combination was drawn and resulted in the Philadelphia 76ers getting the first pick. Two years later, the Grizzlies won the lottery and likewise had to pick second in the draft, while the L.A. Clippers obtained the first pick. The Raptors did not pick first until 2006, when they won the lottery as the fifth-worst non-playoff team. The Grizzlies have yet to hold the first selection.\n\nThe lottery is normally held during either the third or fourth week of May.\n\nTo determine the winner, fourteen ping pong balls numbered 1–14 are placed in a standard lottery machine and four balls are randomly selected from the lot. Just as in most traditional lotteries, the order in which the numbers are drawn is not important. That is, 1–2–3–4 is considered to be the same as 4–3–2–1. There are a total of 1,001 combinations (or (14x13x12x11) / (4x3x2x1)). Of these combinations, one outcome is disregarded and the remaining outcomes are distributed among the 14 non-playoff NBA teams. The combination 11–12–13–14 (in any order that those numbers are drawn) is not assigned and is ignored if drawn; this has never occurred in practice.\n\nIn the event a lottery pick is traded to another team, the record of the original team (whose pick it was before the trade) still determines eligibility for the lottery, and assignment of chances.\n\nSince 2005, with 30 NBA teams, 16 qualify for the playoffs and the remaining 14 teams enter in the draft lottery. These 14 teams were ranked in reverse order of their regular season record and assigned the following number of chances, up to 2018:\n\n\nThe following table listed the odds for each seed to get specific picks if there were no ties (rounded to 9 decimal places).\n\nBeginning with the 2019 draft, the NBA changed the lottery odds as follows:\n\n\nThe following table lists the odds for each seed to get specific picks, beginning with the 2019 draft, if there were no ties (rounded to 9 decimal places).\n\nIn the event that teams finish with the same record, each tied team receives the \"average\" of the total number of combinations for the positions that they occupy. In 2007, the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Portland Trail Blazers tied for the sixth worst record. The average of the 6th and 7th positions in the lottery was taken, resulting in each team getting 53 combinations (the average of 63 and 43). Should the average number not be an integer, a coin flip is then used to determine which team or teams receive the extra combination. The result of the coin flip is also used to determine who receives the earlier pick in the event that neither of the tied teams wins one of the first four picks via the lottery.\n\nThe lottery is conducted with witnesses (from the accounting firm Ernst & Young) verifying that all fourteen balls are represented once as they are placed in the lottery machine. The balls are placed in the machine for 20 seconds to randomize before the first ball is drawn. The remaining three balls are drawn at 10-second intervals. NBA officials determine which team holds the winning combination and that franchise is awarded the #1 overall draft pick. The four balls are returned to the machine and the process is repeated to determine the second and third picks. In the event that a combination belongs to a team that has already won its pick (or if the one unassigned combination comes up), the round is repeated until a unique winner is determined. Prior to the 2019 draft, when the first three teams had been determined, the remaining picks were given out based on regular season record with the worst teams getting the highest picks. This assured each team that it could drop no more than three spots from its projected draft position. Beginning with the 2019 draft, the number of combinations drawn is increased from 3 to 4, with the remaining picks still assigned based on regular season record. A team then drops no more than four spots from its projected position.\n\nIn a case where a lottery team trades its pick to a playoff team, the playoff team assumes the lottery team's position in all draft lottery situations, unless provisioned by the conditions of the trade.\n\nThe drawing of the ping-pong balls is conducted in private, though observed by independent auditors and representatives from each team. The results are subsequently presented in a televised unveiling (formerly broadcast as a short ceremony prior to or during halftime of an NBA playoff game, but since the mid-2010s, presented as an hour-long special by ESPN), in which the order of the lottery is announced in reverse order, from the fourteenth selection to the first. Representatives from each NBA franchise with a lottery pick are present at the lottery ceremony.\n\nThe decision of not showing the ping-pong balls live has fueled speculation that the NBA occasionally fixes the draft lottery if it can benefit the league. The speculation originated with the 1985 draft lottery that sent Patrick Ewing to New York, with the theory being that the NBA wanted to send the best player in the draft to New York to increase ratings in a large television market. At that time, the NBA used seven envelopes in a tumbler representing the seven teams with the worst record. Some have speculated that the envelope containing the Knicks logo was refrigerated beforehand, enabling David Stern to recognize and select it. Another conspiracy theory suggests that one of the seven envelopes was thrown into the tumbler, causing one of the corners to fold. After the envelopes were mixed, Stern took a deep breath before reaching into the tumbler and picking the envelope with the folded corner. No one has ever explained why all the other teams would go along with the fix. Afterward, the Draft Lottery Format was changed to the current ping-pong ball lottery in a private room with team representatives. However, despite the lack of any evidence, conspiracy theories still persist regarding the annual outcome of the lottery.\n\nThe largest upset in the lottery occurred in 1993 when the Magic won the lottery with just a 1.5% chance to win. The second largest upsets occurred in 2008 and 2014 when the Chicago Bulls and Cleveland Cavaliers both won their respective lotteries with just a 1.7% chance. In 1999, the Charlotte Hornets also overcame long odds in the draft lottery when they won the third pick despite having the best record among all non-playoff teams. The Hornets only had a 1.83% chance of winning a top-three pick. Since the lottery was introduced in 1985, only 18 of 30 NBA teams have won the lottery. The Los Angeles Clippers have won five lotteries, although two of them were conveyed to other teams in trades prior to the lottery. The Orlando Magic, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Brooklyn Nets are second with three lottery wins each. Since the weighted lottery system was introduced in 1990, only seven teams with the worst record went on to win the lottery while only four teams with the second-worst record have won the lottery.\n\n\n"}

A sequel, \"\", was released in 2009.\n\nThe story revolves around protagonist hip hop musician 50 Cent's search for vengeance against the hitmen who attempted to murder him. The game features members of the G-Unit rap crew as a gang. Dr. Dre plays an arms dealer, Eminem plays a corrupt police officer, and DJ Whoo Kid plays himself as a person selling \"bootlegged\" music (of the G-Unit camp) out of his trunk. A soundtrack album titled, \"Bulletproof\", was released by DJ Red Heat's Shadyville Entertainment. It won \"Best Original Song\" in the 2005 Spike TV Video Game Awards.\n\n50 Cent finds himself being dragged back into the criminal underworld, taking on the most dangerous criminal organizations in New York City. 50 Cent gets a call from his former cellmate and friend K Dog, letting him know he is trouble. 50 Cent gets his gun and leaves, getting his crew together: rappers Lloyd Banks, the locksmith, Young Buck and Tony Yayo, a demolition expert. The crew goes to Queens, where they see K Dog being physically assaulted by unknown masked assailants. After killing multiple assailants, 50 Cent is shot nine times and left for dead. 50 Cent is brought to Doc Friday, a former licensed doctor until he started writing prescriptions for himself. After recovering, 50 Cent goes to Detective Aaron McVicar, a corrupt cop, for information. McVicar agrees to help 50 Cent in exchange for money. 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks go to see K Dog at a safe house, guarded by masked assailants and federal agents. They discover K Dog as well as the federal prosecutors' corpses. 50 gets K Dog's belongings and brings it back to Bugs, who is able to listen to the messages left on the phone. The messages say K Dog was supposed to meet up with \"Spyder\", a crystal meth drug dealer about transport routes. 50 decides to go after Spyder and goes to a junkyard to meet up with him. After killing Spyder's assailants along with McVicar, he kills Spyder. They notice a tattoo similar to the one on K Dog. He cuts Spyder's skin with the tattoo on it and gives it to Bugs. The tattoo is traced back to Wu-Jang, a Chinese drug kingpin. 50 kills Wu-Jang in Chinatown and takes his money.\n\nOn August 29, 2006, Vivendi Universal Games released a G-Unit edition for the PlayStation Portable. While the story and cut-scenes are the same as the console counterpart, the game eschews the third-person perspective game-play for a top-down, isometric viewpoint. Also added is multiplayer game-play through ad hoc wireless connectivity. The PlayStation Portable version featured a \"Vitamin Water\" mini-game in which the player plays as 50 Cent at the apex of his business endeavors.\n\n\"50 Cent: Bulletproof\" received generally mixed reviews due to poor gameplay mechanics, but it was praised for its solid storyline and music. It received 1 out of 5 and a Golden Mullet from X-Play. In spite of this, it received a positive rating of 8/10 from \"Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine\".\n\nThe PlayStation Portable \"G-Unit Edition\" received mixed reviews from critics. GameSpot's Alex Navarro did, however, say that it was a better game than the PS2 or Xbox versions.\"\n\n\"50 Cent: Bulletproof\" sold nearly 1.2 million copies. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of \"Bulletproof\" had sold 600,000 copies and earned $27 million in the United States. \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 98th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Overall sales of \"Bulletproof\" reached 850,000 units in the United States by July 2006. Its PlayStation 2 version received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

The idea of Pakola came from its founder Haji Ali Mohammad, who dreamed of developing a drink that portrayed the true reflection and taste of Pakistan. In order to pursue his dream, Haji Ali Mohammad opened a small factory with only two machines at Lawrence Road in Karachi with Pakola Ice-cream Soda being the initial product. \n\nThe drink was launched at Pakistan Air Force Base on the anniversary of Pakistan's Independence, 14 August 1950, in the presence of the first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan.\n\nLater when Pakistan Beverages (PB) came into existence at SITE Karachi, the brand Pakola was produced there. In 1979 when Pakistan Beverages was announced as a production facility for Pepsi, Mehran Bottlers came into existence and continued to produce the drink along with other products such as Apple Sidra and Bubble Up.\n\nMehran Bottlers was managed by his nephews Zafar Habib and Arif Habib. In 2004, Mehran Bottlers and Pakistan Beverages started manufacturing cans in Pakistan. \n\nIn 2004, Zeeshan Z. Habib took charge as the chief executive officer of Mehran Bottlers. Mehran Bottlers is now among the few companies that are certified HALAL, HACCP, ISO and by the FDA.\n\nIn 2007, with the exception of Karachi, the Teli family gave the franchise rights of Pakola to the Leghari family who previously owned Pepsi Sukkur. The Leghari family has the right to sell Pakola nationally with the exception of Karachi, while all exports are done from the Karachi plant. \n\nSince the company's founding, many beverages have been introduced in the local as well as the international market, but none have overtaken the original Pakola drink.\n\nSeveral of the variants that have been introduced by Pakola:\n\n\nPakola is made with carbonated water, sugar, citric acid, cream soda artificial flavor, Color: FD&C Bleu No 1 (E 133), FD&C Yellow No.5 (E 102), and sodium benzoate. A typical can of Pakola (8.5 fl ounces/250 ml) has 33 g of sugar, 15 mg of sodium, 0 g of cholesterol, 0 g fat, 0 g of protein, and 130 calories.\n\nPakola is currently produced by two companies, Mehran Bottlers Limited and Gul Bottlers. \n\nPakola is now available in America, Africa, Australia, Canada, Middle East, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It the only carbonated beverage manufactured in Pakistan that is exported globally. \n\nDue to the introduction of the capacity tax in 2013, Pakola discontinued the production and distribution of all glass-bottled products. The tax was levied on the overall production and distribution of the machinery instead of output, which was detrimental for companies with lower productions or smaller markets. After the collapse of this system, Mehran Bottlers quickly set up their PET lines to grasp the market once again.\n\n"}

After meeting his new neighbor, Laura, Bart develops a crush on her, only to later discover that she has a boyfriend, Jimbo Jones, whom he attempts to scare off so that he can have a relationship with Laura. Meanwhile, Homer sues the Sea Captain Horatio McCallister after being kicked out of his all-you-can-eat restaurant while still hungry. \n\nThe episode was written by Conan O'Brien and directed by Wes Archer.\n\nThe Simpsons' elderly neighbors, the Winfields, finally relocate because of Homer's antics. Bart and Lisa explore the old house while it is empty and up for sale, but Bart scares Lisa away from the basement. Bart turns around to see his new neighbor, Laura Powers. Surprised, he falls down in shock and is helped back up by her and the two become acquainted. Bart instantly develops a crush on her.\n\nAfter Marge visits Ruth Powers to welcome her to the area, she tells Marge that she has divorced, and both become friends. Meanwhile, after seeing a television advertisement about an all-you-can-eat seafood restaurant, Homer forces Marge to come with him, so Laura decides to babysit Bart and Lisa. Homer quickly enrages the Sea Captain, devouring nearly all the food in the buffet, and is eventually banished despite not being satisfied. Much to Marge's embarrassment, Homer sues the restaurant for false advertising. Lionel Hutz is employed to represent him in court and the case is successful after Hutz convinces the mostly overweight jury that a similar buffet mishap could befall them. To avoid further legal trouble, the Sea Captain and Homer eventually agree that Homer shall be displayed in the restaurant as \"Bottomless Pete: Nature's Cruelest Mistake\" to draw in more customers to the restaurant and offset the cost of his eating.\n\nMeanwhile, Bart is delighted at having Laura babysitting him and attempts to impress her. She later asks him to come to his treehouse, as she has important news. She tells him she is dating Jimbo Jones, one of the bullies from his school, which dismays Bart. When Laura invites Jimbo over to the Simpson household, Bart, in an attempt to break them up, prank calls Moe's Tavern, giving his name as \"Jimbo Jones\", and telling Moe where he lives. Mistakenly believing Jimbo was the one who had been pranking Moe all the time, he rushes into the Simpson house brandishing a large \"rusty and dull\" kitchen knife and looking for Jimbo, causing Jimbo to burst into tears and beg for his life. Laura breaks up with Jimbo for not being the tough \"outlaw\" she thought he was. She tells Bart that she would date him if he were older, and the episode ends with the pair laughing after prank-calling Moe again.\n\nThe episode was written by Conan O'Brien and directed by Wes Archer. The episode's original subplot was intended to include American actor and comedian Don Rickles as a guest star presenting a comedy show and Homer laughing excessively at his jokes, until Rickles ridicules him. The pair were intended to start fighting and end up having to go to court. Despite O'Brien and other production staff being sure that Rickles would appear in the episode, he was reportedly upset by the concept of the storyline, as he did not wish to be portrayed as a \"mean guy\".\n\nWhen attending a Fox Broadcasting Company publicity event in New York City with Rupert Murdoch, show producer Matt Groening was introduced by Murdoch to Rickles. Rickles began shouting at Groening, accusing him of spying on his Las Vegas act and using material from that for the episode. The cast actually had been receiving recordings from Rickles from the 1950s to use as ideas on how to get the style for his animatic portrayal. Another side story the writers produced was for Homer to become an outstanding barber and hair dresser, but this was never used.\n\n\"New Kid on the Block\" features first time appearances from Laura Powers, Ruth Powers, and The Sea Captain. Hank Azaria based the Sea Captain's voice on that of actor Robert Newton.\n\nThe courtroom scene in which numerous sacks of letters to Santa Claus are delivered to court is a parody of the 1947 film \"Miracle on 34th Street\". \"Hunks\", the game show Homer is watching at the beginning of the episode, is a parody of \"Studs\". The music playing while the moose eats the Simpsons' garbage is a reference to the TV show \"Northern Exposure\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"New Kid on the Block\" finished 23rd in ratings for the week of November 9–16, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.4, equivalent to approximately 13.4 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating \"Beverly Hills, 90210\". \n\nIn 1998, \"TV Guide\" included it in its list of the top twelve \"Simpsons\" episodes. \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", commented that it was \"a fun episode, introducing the Powers family [and featuring] the last appearance of the Winfields\". \n\nIn a 2008 article, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named Sara Gilbert's role as Laura Powers as one of the sixteen best guest appearances on \"The Simpsons\".\n\n"}

It was signed by the Ottoman Minister of Marine Affairs Rauf Bey and the British Admiral Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe, on board HMS \"Agamemnon\" in Moudros harbor on the Greek island of Lemnos.\n\nAs part of several conditions to the armistice, the Ottomans surrendered their remaining garrisons outside Anatolia, as well as granted the Allies the right to occupy forts controlling the Straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosporus; and the right to occupy the same \"in case of disorder\" any Ottoman territory in the event of a threat to their security. The Ottoman army including the Ottoman air force was demobilized, and all ports, railways, and other strategic points were made available for use by the Allies. In the Caucasus, the Ottomans had to retreat to within the pre-war borders between the Ottoman and the Russian Empires.\n\nThe armistice was followed by the occupation of Constantinople (Istanbul) and the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Treaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920), which was signed in the aftermath of World War I, imposed harsh terms on the Ottoman Empire, but it was never ratified by the Ottoman Parliament in Istanbul. The Ottoman Parliament was officially disbanded by the Allies on 11 April 1920 due to the overwhelming opposition of the Turkish MPs to the provisions discussed in Sèvres. Afterward, the Turkish War of Independence was fought from 1919–1923. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey, established in Ankara on 23 April 1920 by Mustafa Kemal Pasha and his followers (including former MPs of the closed Ottoman Parliament), became the new de-facto government of Turkey. The Armistice of Mudros was superseded by the Treaty of Lausanne, signed on 24 July 1923, following the Turkish victory in the War of Independence.\n\nWorld War I took a chaotic turn in 1918 for the Ottoman Empire. With Yudenich's Russian Caucasus Army deserting after the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Ottomans regained ground in Armenia and even pushed into formerly Russian-controlled Caucasus with, at first, Vehip Pasha's Ottoman 3rd Army and, later beginning in June 1918, with Nuri Pasha's Army of Islam which excluded German officers and men. The Caucasus Campaign put the Ottomans at odds with their ally, Germany, which had been hoping to purchase Caucasus oil from the Bolshevik government in Moscow. The Ottomans wanted to establish its eastern borders The Ottoman armies advanced far into Caucasus, gathering supporters as far away as Tashkent, on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea. Additionally, with the Bolsheviks in power in Moscow, chaos spread in Persia, as the Russo-British favoring government of Ahmad Shah Qajar lost authority outside of the capital. In contrast, in Syria, the Ottomans were steadily pushed back by British forces, culminating in the fall of Damascus in October 1918. Hopes were initially high for the Ottomans that their losses in Syria might be compensated with successes in the Caucasus. Enver Pasha, one of the most influential members of the Ottoman government, maintained an optimistic stance, hid information that made the Ottoman position appear weak, and led most of the Ottoman elite to believe that the war was still winnable.\n\nDevelopments in Southeast Europe quashed the Ottoman government's hopes. The Macedonian front, also known as the Salonika campaign, had been largely stable since 1916. In September 1918, the Allied forces (under the command of Louis Franchet d'Espèrey) mounted a sudden offensive which proved quite successful. The Bulgarian army was defeated, and Bulgaria was forced to sue for peace in the Armistice of Salonica. That undermined both the German and Ottoman cause simultaneously, as the Germans had no troops to spare to defend Austria-Hungary from the newly formed vulnerability in Southeastern Europe after the losses it had suffered in France, and the Ottomans suddenly faced having to defend Constantinople against an overland European siege without help from the Bulgarians.\n\nGrand Vizier Talaat Pasha visited Berlin, Germany, and Sofia, Bulgaria in September 1918. He came away with the understanding that the war was no longer winnable. With Germany likely seeking a separate peace, the Ottomans would be forced to do so as well. Talaat convinced the other members of the ruling party that they must resign, as the Allies would impose far harsher terms if they thought the people who started the war were still in power. He also sought out the United States to see if he could surrender to them and gain the benefits of the Fourteen Points despite the Ottoman Empire and the United States not being at war; however, the Americans never responded, as they were waiting on British advice as to how to respond that never came. On October 13, Talaat and the rest of his ministry resigned. Ahmed Izzet Pasha replaced Talaat as Grand Vizier. Two days after taking office, he sent the captured British General Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend to the Allies to seek terms on an armistice.\n\nThe British cabinet received word of the offer and were eager to negotiate a deal. The standing terms of the alliance was that the first member that was approached for an armistice should conduct the negotiations; the British government interpreted that to mean that Britain conduct the negotiations alone. The motives for this are not entirely clear, whether it was the sincere British interpretation of the alliance terms, fears that the French would insist on over-harsh demands and foil a treaty, or a desire to cut the French out of territorial \"spoils\" promised to them in the Sykes–Picot Agreement. Townshend also indicated that the Ottomans preferred to deal with the British; he did not know about the American contact or that Talaat had sent an emissary to the French as well but that emissary had been slower to respond back. The British cabinet empowered Admiral Calthorpe to conduct the negotiations with an explicit exclusion of the French from them. They also suggested an armistice rather than a full peace treaty, in the belief that a peace treaty would require the approval of all of the Allied nations and be too slow.\n\nThe negotiations began on Sunday, October 27 on HMS \"Agamemnon\", a British battleship. The British refused to admit French Vice-Admiral Jean Amet, the senior French naval officer in the area, despite his desire to join; the Ottoman delegation, headed by Minister of Marine Affairs Rauf Bey, indicated that it was acceptable as they were accredited only to the British, not the French.\n\nBoth sides did not know that the other was actually quite eager to sign a deal and willing to give up some of their objectives to do so. The British delegation had been given a list of 24 demands, but were told to concede on any of them if pressed, except occupation of the forts on the Dardanelles and free passage through the Bosphorus; the British desired access to the Black Sea for the Rumanian front. Prime Minister David Lloyd George also wanted to make a deal quickly before the United States could step in; according to the diary of Maurice Hankey:\n\nThe Ottoman authorities, for their part, believed the war to be lost and would have accepted almost any demands placed on them. As a result, the initial draft prepared by the British was accepted largely unchanged; the Ottoman side did not know it could have pushed back on most of the clauses, and the British did not know they could have demanded even more. Still, the terms were largely pro-British and close to an outright surrender; the Ottoman Empire ceded the rights to the Allies to occupy \"in case of disorder\" any Ottoman territory, a vague and broad clause.\n\nThe French were displeased with the precedent; French Premier Georges Clemenceau disliked the British making unilateral decisions in so important a matter. Lloyd George countered that the French had concluded a similar armistice on short notice in the Armistice of Salonica, which had been negotiated by French General d'Esperey and that Great Britain (and Tsarist Russia) had committed the vast majority of troops to the campaign against the Ottoman Empire. The French agreed to accept the matter as closed. The Ottoman educated public, however, was given misleadingly positive impressions of the severity of the terms of the Armistice. They thought its terms were considerably more lenient than they actually were, a source of discontent later when it seemed that the Allies had violated the offered terms during the Turkish War of Independence.\n\nThe Armistice of Mudros officially brought hostilities to an end between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire. However, incursions by the Italians and Greeks into Anatolia in the name of \"restoring order\" soon came close to an outright partition of the country. The Treaty of Sèvres in 1920 officially partitioned the Ottoman Empire into zones of influence; however, the Turkish War of Independence (1919–23) saw the rejection of the treaty by Turkish nationalist forces based in Ankara, who eventually took control of the Anatolian Peninsula. Ottoman territory in Syria, Palestine, and Arabia stayed as distributed by the Treaty of Sèvres while the borders of the Turkish nation-state were set by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.\n\n"}

Schneider ended up winning the part, to which he found much success. A few years later, due to merchandising conflicts, Schneider and co-star Tom Wopat walked out on the show, and Cherry, along with Christopher Mayer, were called in to replace them as Coy and Vance Duke. Cherry and Mayer both made their debuts on \"Dukes\" in September 1982. Despite fairly similar physical and behavioral resemblances to the familiar leads played by Wopat and Schneider, Cherry and Mayer's characters of Coy and Vance were not accepted by viewing audience, and ratings for the popular series began to sag during the 19 episodes in which they appeared. By the middle of the 1982–83 season, Warner Bros. came to new agreeable salary terms with Wopat and Schneider, and in February 1983, both of the original stars returned to the show.

{"id": "1891821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891821", "title": "Ahmad Kaddour", "text": "Ahmad Kaddour\n\nAhmad \"Babyface\" Kaddour (born January 1, 1982, Lebanon) is a professional boxer.\n\nBorn in Tripoli, Lebanon, Kaddour's parents fled the 1982 Lebanon War and Ahmad grew up in Denmark where he got his start in boxing. He has moved back and forth between Europe and the United States since 2003.\n\nAfter winning the Danish National Amateur Championship in 2000, and his 2nd Nordic Amateur Championship (1999 and 2000), and lots of international amateur experience (Dual in England, Finland, Dual in Sweden, Home dual v Sweden, Germany), Kaddour turned pro. Kaddour started his career in Europe, fighting in Denmark, Wales, Hungary, Finland, Italy and Germany including a fight against Alessio Furlan at Braunschweig, Germany. The fight went the full distance with Kaddour winning narrowly on points to inflict Furlan with the first defeat of his professional career. Soon after Kaddour moved to the United States to further his career.\n\nIn 2003–2004, Kaddour fought 4 out of 5 fights in the USA, the other in Germany, against opponents with winning records and won 3 of the 4 USA fights by stoppage, and was very confident at 18-0 when selected to participate on the reality TV show \"The Contender\", broadcast worldwide, and was placed on the East Coast team. While on the team, he got involved in a feud with Ishe Smith early on and they fought in the 3rd match. At the time Smith was world ranked by all 4 sanctioning organizations and held the USBA, the NABO, and the WBC Continental Americas titles. Kaddour gunned for an early KO but Smith weathered the storm and won by unanimous decision, calling it a \"tough fight\" afterwards. Kaddour was voted back into the quarterfinals after Juan de la Rosa pulled out – a tactic by Jesse Brinkley, Anthony Bonsante, Peter Manfredo, and Joey Gilbert designed to get under Smith's skin. The week after Smith lost a split decision to eventual Contender and WBC champion Sergio Mora, Ahmad was matched with Alfonso Gomez (who went on after the show to challenge for the WBA 147 lb and WBC 154 lb titles) by the same boxers who brought Kaddour back, with the hope that the two tough fighters would battle hard and the winner would be less ready for the semi-finals. Kaddour beat Gomez's face badly (Gomez pointed to his face in a post fight interview saying this was his sacrifice) and came away relatively unscathed himself, even knocking Gomez backwards in the 4th, and buckling Gomez's legs and sending him 3 steps back into the ropes in the last round, but Gomez was busier overall and Kaddour lost by 1 round on 1 card and 3 rounds on the other 2 cards. Kaddour claimed that he would be back and wished Alfonso the best.\n\nThe first of the Contender contestants to fight again after the show's finale, Kaddour dominated through an 8-round unanimous decision against Maxell Taylor on July 22, 2005, on Showtime's \"\".\nMonths later he fought Jesus Felipe Valverde to a draw due to a recurring stamina problem. Two of the judges scored the fight even and the third had Kaddour winning by two rounds. Two months after this, in November 2006, Ahmad had a rematch against Valverde, which he won by split decision on Versus. Valverde, who had gone the distance with future world titlists Carlos Quintana, Kermit Cintrón, and Yuri Foreman, as well as other top competition, was the busier fighter, but Kaddour was the more effective puncher. After the fight during an on camera interview when asked about his stamina in the final rounds, Kaddour explained that he had to drop weight from 192 lbs to 148 lbs, and that he had been born premature which might effect one of his lungs, and the combination may have taken away from his work rate.\n\nAhmad's fiancé on the \"Contender\" series was Brandy Collins, an American who sponsored him for a fiancé visa. They were married after the Contender and had a son in 2006. Brandy later told him to leave their home in Houston. According to BoxingScene.com and a Houston Tribune article, Ahmad entered the home (still registered in both their names) without her permission in June 2007 and was charged with burglary. He pleaded guilty to Class A Misdemeanor trespassing and was sentenced to 180 days in Harris County Jail in downtown Houston and Brandy withdrew her sponsorship of him with the INS, causing Kaddour to be transferred to immigration agents and deported to Denmark upon his release from federal custody in December 2007, and Collins obtained a divorce. Kaddour also reportedly had problems breathing through his nose and had surgery.\n\nAfter an almost 3-year hiatus from boxing working a steady job, Kaddour appeared on the undercard of Danish Super middleweight Mikkel Kessler's defense of the WBA title at the Messecenter Herning, Denmark, September 12, 2009, winning a unanimous decision over the tough German, Mike Ermis. He returned to the United States and beat Jerome Ellis by unanimous decision on March 26, 2010, then back to Denmark, where on February 11, 2011, he beat Lee Noble on Denmark's TV2 \"Fight Night\". Kaddour trained with Greg Coverson at the \"Detroit Boxing Jungle\" before scoring a 5th-round TKO over Vance Garvey at the Motor City Casino on October 6. His next 3 fights were for Sauerland Events on Viasat's Nordic Fight Night series, with 2012 decisions over Britain's Gary Boulden and Max Maxwell and a September 2013 unanimous decision over Estonia's Aleksei Tsatiasvili. He is back training in Brian Mathiasen's gym, where he was guided through the early part of his pro career, and Mathiasen said his primary focus is getting Kaddour in the best physical condition of his career, as conditioning has consistently been Kaddour's biggest challenge.\n\nIn August 2012 World Boxing News spoke with both Ishe Smith and Alfonso Gomez about possible rematches with Kaddour, giving him the opportunity to avenge his only 2 losses. Smith ruled a rematch out in the immediate future as he was still trying to attain his first world title shot through Golden Boy Promotions (since won a majority decision over \"The Contender 2\" bronze medalist Cornelius Bundrage for the IBF 154 lb title 2/23/13), but Gomez expressed interest and promised to \"beat him worse this time\". February 2013, Kaddour stated he holds no ill will toward Smith from their Contender days despite the taunting that led to their old rivalry, but he still very much wants a rematch with Smith. In August 2013, Smith said \"Beating Ahmed was right up there\" with his best fights before winning the IBF title.\n\n"}

He also has a line of electric basses and string instruments through his company called NS Design and was also the designer of the first ever Spector bass, the NS. In addition, Ned and Emmett Chapman, creator of the Chapman Stick, collaborated on the creation of the NS Stick, a guitar/bass \"multi-mode\" instrument sold by Stick Enterprises.\n\nNed Steinberger began his design career creating furniture and custom cabinetry. In 1977, while working alongside luthier Stuart Spector, Ned designed his first musical instrument, the Spector NS-1 bass guitar. While attempting to source materials in an industrial area of New York City, he visited Lane Marine, a lifeboat builder, where he met with Bob Young, an engineer with deep knowledge of carbon fiber. Though Young was more than twice Steinberger’s age and had no experience with musical instruments, he joined forces with Steinberger after getting great feedback from his son, a recording engineer, who took to the instrument and understood the appeal of its construction.The Spector NS quickly became Spector’s most popular bass design and remains so to this day. Inspired by that first creation, Steinberger set out to explore the possibilities of bass design. His search lead to alternate materials, like carbon fiber and the headless concept. His company, Steinberger Sound, launched in 1980, found immediate success with the L2 bass. Steinberger headless guitars and other bass models followed. After selling Steinberger to the Gibson group of musical instruments, Ned started a second company, NS Design in 1990. NS Design continues Ned Steinberger's boundary-pushing designs with a family of bowed electric instruments as well as headless guitars and basses.\n\nNed is the son of 1988 physics Nobel laureate Jack Steinberger (born 1921 in Germany).\n\n"}

Boxing immediately ignited interest in Jimmy when he realized the level of discipline, respect, and skill that was needed to be a great boxer.\n\nLange was a contestant on the first season of the NBC reality TV show, The Contender, produced and hosted by Sylvester Stallone and Sugar Ray Leonard. Stallone’s brother attended one of Jimmy’s boxing matches in Washington DC and was so impressed, he recommended him for the show as one of the 16 boxers. Current special adviser, \"First Lady of Boxing\" Jackie Kallen served as 'den mother' on the show.\n\nOn the show, Jimmy was placed on the East Coast team and fought Joey Gilbert in the final First Round fight, a fight Lange lost. Lange was originally scheduled to fight Anthony Bonsante however, an argument ensued over Bonsante choosing not to do so—possibly seeing Lange as a greater threat.\n\nLange was voted back to fight in the top \"fan favorite\" fight at the show's finale where he beat contestant Tarick Salmaci in a majority decision.\n\nLange is currently trained by highly regarded Don Turner who has worked previously with former world champions Evander Holyfield and Larry Holmes, among others.

He was challenged to fight Alfonso Gomez in the first fight, and lost—much to everyone's surprise. But when Jeff Fraza was withdrawn with chickenpox, he was brought back in—by \"fate\" he said. He beat Miguel Espino in his second chance at the first round, and went on to face Joey Gilbert in the second round. Here, an accidental headbutt stopped the fight, and Manfredo was given a win on points. He then was re-matched up with Gomez, whom he beat, in the semi-final. \nIn the final fight he was defeated by Sergio Mora in a seven-round unanimous decision, and Mora became the Contender champion. Manfredo fought a second bout against Mora on October 15, 2005 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. Mora defeated Manfredo by a split decision in the rematch. Many ringside observers felt Manfredo won the fight convincingly, but Mora won by a controversial split decision.\n\nManfredo fought Scott Pemberton on February 2, 2006 to a sold out crowd in the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island on ESPN. It was his first fight at Super Middleweight, as he won by a 3rd-round knockout. On October 14, 2006 Manfredo defeated Joey Spina with a 3rd-round TKO also at the Dunkin' Donuts Center.\n\nOn April 7, 2007, Manfredo fought Welsh undefeated Super Middleweight Champion Joe Calzaghe in Calzaghe's 20th title defense. The fight was originally scheduled for March 3, but had to be re-arranged for the later date. The show, from the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff was aired on HBO in the United States. Manfredo lost the fight when the referee stopped the contest in the third round, with Manfredo appearing unable to reply to Calzaghe's unending barrage of shots. Manfredo claimed his plan was to have Calzaghe (then 34) \"run out of gas\". Manfredo himself believed that the fight was stopped prematurely. One month later Manfredo easily defeated Ted Muller in a ninth round stoppage at Twin River Casino in Lincoln Rhode Island.\n\nManfredo's next fight was June 20, 2007 just one month after his previous victory over Muller, at Foxwoods Hotel and Casino, against tough veteran (14-1) David Banks, who was featured on season 3 of the Contender. Manfredo got the relatively easy decision 97-93 on all the judges' cards. Manfredo then signed to fight former World Champion Jeff Lacy on December 8 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, as the final bout on the undercard to the Floyd Mayweather vs Ricky Hatton main event. Manfredo lasted the distance against Lacy, but lost by unanimous decision.\n\nOn March 14, 2008, Manfredo defeated Shane Benfield, then (29-5), at the Twin River Events Center in Lincoln, Rhode Island. A series of attacks to the body from Manfredo eventually forced a stoppage after 2:30 of the sixth round. May 3, 2008 Peter defeated Luis Lopez by KO in the 3rd round at the Couer D'Alene Casino Idaho.\n\nOn a CES card appropriately billed as “August Annihilation,” Manfredo savagely annihilated Donny by TKO of round two, on August 22 at the Twin Rivers Events Center winning the vacant NABF Interim super middleweight belt. The win put Manfredo as one of the top 5 Super Middleweights in the world.\n\nManfredo would get an IBO Title shot in his next bout against Sakio Bika on November 13, 2008 at the Dunkin Donut Center. He was knocked out in the third round by the Season 3 winner of the Contender. With the loss, Manfredo dropped to 31-6. Manfredo stated after the fight that it may be his last time in the ring, but he later opted to fight again. He returned, on April 18, 2009 at the Montreal Casino, Montreal, and defeated Canadian super middleweight Walid Smichet by a devastating left hook in the last minute of round 7.\n\nAfter the fight, Manfredo announced he is moving down to Middleweight, where he was ranked 9th in the World. He planned on fighting John Duddy, but Duddy had suffered his first loss in his last fight. He has stated multiple times, he would like to fight Sergio Mora a third time, this time being in Providence Rhode Island. On June 15, 2009 Manfredo signed a three-fight deal to be promoted exclusively by Chet Koerner's TKO Promotions. In his first fight with TKO Promotions, Peter defeated Ronald Weaver by 1st-round TKO, after Weaver refused to come out of his corner for the second round. The fight was a tune-up fight, fought for charity at the Jonathan Ogden Boxing Classic.\n\nOn January 29, 2010, Peter Manfredo defeated St. Paul Minnesota native Matt Vanda by unanimous decision (100-89, 100-89, 99-90) in a 10-round attraction at Mohegan Sun Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut. He knocked down Vanda at the end of round 6. Manfredo was then crowned NABF Middleweight Champion and ranked 12th in the World in the middleweight division. The fight earned Manfredo a shot at the IBO Middleweight Title, which he won, when he defeated Mexican native Angel Hernandez on May 22, 2010.\n\nOn November 12, 2010, Manfredo stopped Jhon Berrio for his fifth win in a row. The fight was stopped before the 7th round, when Berrio was unable to continue. On January 14, 2011, he stopped Daniel Edouard for his sixth win in a row. Manfredo won a unanimous decision with scores of 97-92 and 98-91 (twice).\n\nOn November 2011, Peter Manfredo was stopped by Julio Cesar Chavez Jr in the fifth round of a WBC middleweight title bout. After an entertaining first four rounds \"The Pride of Providence\" seemed to decide he would go down swinging and engaged Chavez in a brawl. Manfredo got hurt and referee Laurence Cole stepped in at 1:52 to end the fight, allowing Julio Cesar Chavez Jr to retain the title.\n\nIn November 2012, Peter Manfredo Jr announced his return to boxing and defeated durable veteran Rayco Saunders in a dominant 10-round decision. Four months later, he beat Contender Season 2 competitor Walter \"2 Guns\" Wright in a 10-round unanimous decision, Manfredo's 12th contest against Contender castmembers.\n\nIn July, after fellow Providence boxer and Contender participant, Gary Balletto, broke his neck at home, Manfredo announced he will take one more return to the ring in November at the Twin River Event Center, against The Contender 4 participant Richard Gingras in honor of Balletto, Manfredo's 13th fight against former Contender series participants, which he won by 8th round tko when the referee waved off the fight after he landed a right uppercut and left hook.\n\n|-\n"}

Navy started the season slowly, going 2–4, before winning three out of their next four games to enter the Army–Navy Game at 5–5. Despite the fact that a win over Army would give Navy a winning record, they would not be bowl eligible, as two of their five wins (Villanova and Delaware) were against teams from Division I-AA, which meant they did not count for bowl eligibility.\n\nArmy entered the game 4–5–1, and needed a win to finish the season at .500.\n\nNeither team was eligible for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy as the United States Air Force Academy team had defeated both Army and Navy earlier in the year to retain the trophy.

{"id": "1891863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891863", "title": "Gerald Brisco", "text": "Gerald Brisco\n\nGerald Floyd Brisco (born September 19, 1946) is an American retired professional wrestler, previously employed by the professional wrestling promotion WWE as a talent scout.\n\nDebuting in 1969, Brisco wrestled for multiple National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) territories throughout the 1970s and early-1980s, in particular Championship Wrestling from Florida and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, winning dozens of championships. Throughout his career, he teamed with his elder brother Jack as The Brisco Brothers. After retiring in 1985, Brisco moved into a backstage role with the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE). He had a late career resurgence between 1997 and 2000 alongside fellow veteran wrestler Pat Patterson as the onscreen \"stooge\" of WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Both Briscos were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nGerald Brisco grew up with five siblings and an absent father in Oklahoma. He followed his brother, Jack Brisco, into amateur wrestling, and was eventually awarded an athletic scholarship to Oklahoma State after winning two AAU tournaments.and only losing two HS matches placing second in Oklahoma States in his only two years of HS wrestling due to broken leg in football. He was a starter on the OSU freshman team winning several matches and tournaments.\n\nDuring the spring break of 1968, Brisco was in Missouri with Jack, and was asked to substitute for his brother's injured tag team partner despite his lack of professional training. After Brisco contracted hepatitis and injured his knee, he decided to drop out of college and become a full-time professional wrestler.\n\nBrisco was trained by his brother and debuted in 1969 as his tag team partner, using the name Gerald Brisco. The Brisco Brothers were a highly successful team, amassing over twenty tag team championships over the course of thirteen years. They arrived in Florida in 1970 (with Brisco becoming Jerry Brisco) and dominated the singles and tag divisions for several years thereafter. It was also in the late 1970s that the Brisco's discovered Terry Bollea, the future wrestling legend best known as Hulk Hogan, who they introduced to Hiro Matsuda for training. Jerry Brisco would amass a number of singles championships throughout the 1970s, including becoming the first holder of Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. On June 20, 1981 he defeated Les Thornton for the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship.\n\nIn 1983, while teaming in the Mid-Atlantic territory, the brothers turned heel against the team of Ricky Steamboat and Jay Youngblood, the NWA World Tag Team Champions.\n\nThe two teams traded the belts back and forth until the feud culminated at the first Starrcade, with Steamboat and Youngblood regaining the championship. The brothers would hold the title one last time in 1984, ultimately losing to the team of Wahoo McDaniel and Mark Youngblood. They would leave the Mid-Atlantic area shortly after.\n\nThe Briscos held minority interests in Georgia Championship Wrestling. In 1984, dissatisfied with the direction of the company and smaller than expected dividends, they convinced equally disgruntled majority shareholder Paul Jones to give them proxy voting of his shares. The three men and Jim Barnett sold their shares to Vince McMahon, enabling him to increase his dominance of the professional wrestling world.\n\nThe brothers entered the World Wrestling Federation in the fall of 1984, once again assuming their familiar role as fan favorites. The Briscos unsuccessfully challenged the North-South Connection, Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch, for the WWF World Tag Team Championship. Both men would retire from the ring in early 1985. After retiring, Brisco began working backstage as a road agent and booker for McMahon.\n\nFollowing the 1997 Montreal Screwjob, Brisco capitalized on his notoriety by becoming an onscreen \"stooge\" of Vince McMahon along with Pat Patterson. The duo portrayed a pair of bumbling comic heels and joined The Corporation and the McMahon-Helmsley Faction. They lampooned Hulk Hogan (then working for World Championship Wrestling, the rival of WWF) by mimicking his trademark gestures and using \"Real American\", his old entrance theme.\n\nOn the May 18, 2000 episode of \"SmackDown!\" Brisco won his first WWF championship when he pinned a sleeping Crash Holly to win the perpetually contested Hardcore Championship. Crash regained the title on June 12 but Brisco was intent on regaining. He pursued Holly around New York City but ran afoul of John Shaft, who had agreed to protect Holly. Brisco eventually regained the title the following week with the aid of Pat Patterson in the midst of a match between Crash and his cousin, Hardcore Holly.\n\nAs Patterson and Brisco celebrated the victory, Patterson poured champagne in Brisco's eyes then broke a second bottle over his head. He then pinned the (kayfabe) unconscious Brisco to win the Hardcore Championship. Patterson hid from Brisco in drag in the women's locker room, and, after Brisco pursued him into the locker room, Vince McMahon booked them in a Hardcore Evening Gown Match at the King of the Ring. In the course of the match, Holly interfered and pinned Patterson, regaining the title once again.\n\nOn July 15, 2005, Brisco was inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. He appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a party scene and also on the July 23, 2007 edition of \"RAW\". On March 29, 2008, Brisco and his brother were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame the night before WrestleMania XXIV in Orlando, Florida.\n\nIn June 2009, Brisco suffered three strokes. Four months later, it was announced that Brisco would not be returning to his position as a road agent in WWE. In March 2010, Jerry Brisco did return to the WWE as a talent scout and recruiter for NXT. According to Jim Ross, on October 19, 2011, Brisco suffered another stroke, a minor one.\n\nDuring the \"Raw Reunion\" episode on July 22, 2019, Brisco pinned Pat Patterson off-screen backstage to win the WWE 24/7 Championship. He became the third person to win both the WWE Hardcore Championship and the WWE 24/7 Championship. He would soon after lose the title to Kelly Kelly.\n\nOn April 15, he was released from his WWE contract as part of budget cuts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBrisco is married, he and his wife Barbara have two sons named Wesley (born 1983) who is also a professional wrestler, known as Wes Brisco, a former FCW Tag Team Champion and Joseph who is a grad student at USF Tampa. Brisco also co-owned a body shop with his brother Bill, and longtime partner Travis Allred, known as the Brisco Brothers Body Shop which is now closed. (As of 1/12/2018 the body shop is open for business) Jack Brisco was also a partner in the business before his death in 2010. The Briscos were inducted into the Chickasaw Nation Hall Of Fame in June 2016. On August 11, 2018, Brisco was inducted into the NWHOF Florida Chapter as “Outstanding American.”\n\nBrisco appears as a manager along side Pat Patterson in WWE2k16.\n\n"}

{"id": "1891882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891882", "title": "Osman Nuri Pasha", "text": "Osman Nuri Pasha\n\nOsman Nuri Bey then Pasha (‎; 1832, Tokat, Ottoman Empire – 4 to 5 April 1900, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire), also known as Gazi Osman Pasha, was an Ottoman field marshal who commanded Ottoman forces during the Siege of Plevna in 1877. Although unsuccessful in defending the city, he was awarded the title of \"Gazi\" (\"warrior\" or \"veteran\") for gallantry in holding the city for five months against superior Russo-Romanian forces. In addition to his Adjutancy title, Osman received the Order of the Medjidie and the Imtiyaz Medal for his services to the Empire. He was made \"Marshal of the Palace\" by the Sultan and the Ottoman military anthem called \"Plevna March\" was composed for his achievements. The Istanbul suburb of Taşlıtarla was renamed Gaziosmanpaşa in his honour.\n\nOsman Nuri was born into the prominent Yağcıoğulları family of the city of Tokat in Central Anatolia. His father was a civil worker who, soon after Osman's birth, was appointed to a position in the Ottoman capital, so the family moved to İstanbul. Osman attended the Beşiktaş Military High School and then graduated from the Ottoman Military College in 1852 as a Lieutenant, entering the Cavalry Arm at the beginning of the Crimean War.\n\nHe served in Crimea, where his bravery secured him a promotion as First Lieutenant. After the end of the war, Osman was appointed to the General Staff and, a year later, had risen to the rank of Captain with the title of Bey. In 1859 he was appointed as a military representative in the forming of the cadastral and census map of the Ottoman Empire, a job he fulfilled for the next two years.\n\nIn 1861, Osman was sent to Beirut Vilayet, where a rebellion had been started by Yusuf Ekrem in Syria. In 1866 he was dispatched to another troubled area of the Empire, Crete, which was engulfed in a massive revolt. His efforts there were noticed by Serdar-ı Ekrem Omar Pasha, so he was promoted to Colonel and awarded the Order of the Medjidie, Third Class Order (Gold). His next appointment was Yemen, in 1868, where he was promoted to the rank of Major-General with the title of Pasha, but also caught a disease which forced him to return to Istanbul in 1871.\n\nAfter a few months of rest, he was placed in charge of the Third Army in Rumelia. In 1873 he became a Lieutenant General and returned for a short while to Istanbul, before being sent to Iskodra and later to Bosnia. His appointment there didn't last long because he couldn't get along with the local governor, Derviş Pasha, so he was moved to the Fourth Army. In 1876, the Principality of Serbia proclaimed its independence and declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Osman Pasha, who had at that time his headquarters at Vidin, defeated the Serbian Army, but in April 1877 Russia declared war on the Ottomans. The Russian troops crossed the Danube into Bulgaria and Osman, with his army of 15,000 men and 174 cannons, was tasked with protecting the important fortress of Nikopol. Before he could get there, the city fell on 16 July after the Battle of Nikopol.\n\nOsman knew that the Russian's next objective would be to cross the Balkan, the last important natural obstacle before Istanbul itself, but they could not risk that if they had a strong enemy force behind them. So he moved his army 20 miles south of Nikopol, at Plevna, a small town surrounded by hills and ravines. The first Russian attack was easily repulsed on 20 July. \n\nAfter that, Osman set about preparing for the next attack. He took advantage of the natural landscape and built a strong network of forts, trench lines, and redoubts that enabled him to fully use his superior armament (his troops had Krupp breech-loading artillery, long range Peabody-Martini rifles and Winchester repeaters, which severely outgunned and outranged the Russians). He also received 5,000 soldiers as reinforcements. On 30 July the Russians attacked again only to lose over 7,000 soldiers (almost a third of the attacking force). By now, with the Russian forces severely depleted and demoralized, Osman Pasha could have launched a counterattack that would have endangered the whole Russian army south of the Danube, but he chose to obey his orders and instead defended Plevna. \n\nThe Russians were quick to recover. Grand Duke Nicholas, commander of the Russian troops, sent an urgent telegram to Prince Carol I of the newly independent Principality of Romania asking for Romanian support. The Romanian Army sent 40,000 soldiers with 112 guns, modern Krupp pieces equal to those of the Ottomans, and Carol I was named commander of the joint Russian-Romanian troops around Plevna. By now, the Allied Army numbered 80,000 soldiers against an Ottoman force of around 40,000. Against Carol's wishes, the Allies launched another large scale attack on Plevna on 11 September. After two days of fighting, even though the Allies had managed to dislodge the Ottomans from a few of the redoubts, almost all of them were recaptured, with the exception of Grivitza 1, taken by the Romanian soldiers. \n\nThe Allies could not withstand such severe casualties, so they settled in for a siege and fully surrounded Plevna. Osman Pasha asked for permission to withdraw before the encirclement was complete, but he was denied. By December, with food and ammunition running low and his troops suffering from starvation, cold and disease, Osman knew he could not hold on throughout the winter and that no help from outside was available. Instead of surrendering, he chose to try and break through the siege lines. On 9 December, the Ottoman army attacked a sector of the Russian line and nearly broke through. But the Russians recovered and closed the breach after bitter hand-to-hand fighting, driving the Ottomans back. But the enveloped army could not return to Plevna because during the engagement with the Russian forces, the Romanian army had stormed the defenses protecting their rear, making a withdrawal to the fortifications impossible. Furthermore, Osman was wounded in the leg by a bullet and his troops panicked, thinking that he had died. With his army caught between the Allies, Osman Pasha had no choice but to capitulate surrender to Mihail Cerchez.\n\nIn 1878, after the Treaty of Berlin was signed on 13 July, which recognized an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria and the independence of the Principality of Romania, the Principality of Serbia and the Principality of Montenegro from the Ottoman Empire, he returned from Russian captivity and received a hero's welcome in Istanbul, being named \"Gazi\" (Victorious) and promoted to the rank of Marshal. He would go on serving as War Minister on four occasions.\nOn the night of 4 to 5 April 1900, he died in Istanbul. He was buried next to the Mosque of Fatih Sultan Mehmet as he requested. His tomb was personally commissioned by Abdülhamit II, who regarded him as one of his greatest generals. He is still revered in Turkey today as a sort of tragic hero who displayed gallant perseverance in the face of hopeless odds, and a Turkish flag is often seen draped on his tomb.\n\nDuring the Russian attack on Nikopol, Osman Pasha was in Vidin with his army. The Ottoman high command ordered Osman Pasha to reinforce Nikopol with 20,000 soldiers. While Osman was on his way to Nikopol, the city fell to the Russians on 16 July 1877. The Russians, knowing that Osman Pasha was heading to Nikopol, planned to intercept and attack his forces. Osman Pasha’s troops were 20 miles away from Nikopol. Osman Pasha quickly created a strong network of fortifications, raising earthworks with redoubts, digging trenches and gun emplacements. On 19 July, Russian troops reached Plevna and started bombarding the town. The next day Russian troops continued the bombardment, eventually forcing some Ottoman units off the outer defences. \nReinforcements began arriving to both sides, as fighting intensified, and the Russians launched an assault. During the first assault, the Russians suffered 4,000 casualties, while the Ottomans suffered 1,000. After this, Osman Pasha strengthened his defences. The Russians were reinforced by the army of Prince Carol I of Romania, who assumed command of the attacking army. On 31 July the Russians attacked Plevna again, but Ottoman troops managed to repulse the assault. After this second engagement, the Russians lost 7.300 men, while Ottomans lost 2,000. After suffering heavy casualties during the assault, the Russians sent out scouts, and resolved to cut off the Ottoman supply lines. To this end, Russian forces attacked the Ottoman garrison at Lovcha. This attack proved to be successful, and the Russians were able to cut off all communications and supply lines to Plevna. By now, Osman Pasha’s army had been reinforced to 30,000, while the Russian forces numbered 100,000. On 11 September, the Russians resumed the artillery bombardment, and mounted another assault. The assault succeeded in taking a few redoubts but Osman Pasha retook most of them. After the third battle, the Russians lost roughly 20,000 men, while the Ottomans lost only 5,000.\n\nAs more Russian and Romanian troops joined the siege, all attacks were halted. General Eduard Ivanovich Todleben came to see the situation of the siege. He was experienced in siege warfare, and decided to encircle the city.\n\nThe Russian-Romanian army closed in by 24 October, as supplies began to run low in the city. On 9 December, Osman Pasha decided to attempt a breakout, and attacked the Russian contingent during the night. Close-quarters combat ensued, but the Russian forces outnumbered the Ottomans. Osman Pasha’s troops were driven back and he was struck in the leg by a stray bullet. Rumors of Osman Pasha’s death spread panic, and Ottoman troops were driven back and enveloped by Romanian forces. At the end of the breakout attempt, the Ottomans had lost 5,000, while the Russians lost 2,000. The next day, Osman Pasha capitulated, surrendering the city to the Romanian Colonel Mihail Cerchez.\n\nA popular Turkish march song about the Battle of Plevna was composed about him: \n\nOriginal lyrics, Turkish language:\n\n\"Tuna nehri akmam diyor\"\n\"Etrafımı yıkmam diyor\"\n\"Tuna nehri akmam diyor\"\n\"Etrafımı yıkmam diyor\"\n\"Şanı büyük Osman Paşa\"\n\"Plevne'den çıkmam diyor.\"\n\"Şanı büyük Osman Paşa\"\n\"Plevne'den çıkmam diyor.\"\n\n\"Düşman Tuna'yı atladı\"\n\"Karakolları yokladı\"\n\"Düşman Tuna'yı atladı\"\n\"Karakolları yokladı\"\n\"Osman Paşa'nın kolunda\"\n\"Beşbin top birden patladı.\"\n\"Osman Paşa'nın kolunda\"\n\"Beşbin top birden patladı.\"\n\n\"Kılıcımı vurdum taşa\"\n\"Taş yarıldı baştan başa\"\n\"Kılıcımı vurdum taşa\"\n\"Taş yarıldı baştan başa\"\n\"Askerinle binler yaşa.\"\n\"Namı büyük Osman Paşa.\"\n\"Askerinle binler yaşa.\"\n\"Namı büyük Osman Paşa.\"\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nThe River Danube says \"I won't flow.\".\nIt says \"I won't ruin my sides.\".\nThe River Danube says \"I won't flow.\".\nIt says \"I won't ruin my sides.\".\nOsman Paşa, the Glorious,\nSays \"I won't leave Plevna.\".\nOsman Paşa, the Glorious,\nSays \"I won't leave Plevna.\".\n\nThe enemy crossed the Danube,\nIt attacked the fortifications.\nThe enemy crossed the Danube,\nIt attacked the fortifications.\nFrom the posts of Osman Paşa,\nFive thousand artilleries fired simultaneously.\nFrom the posts of Osman Paşa,\nFive thousand artilleries fired simultaneously.\n\nI struck my sword on a stone.\nThe stone was split from end to end.\nI struck my sword on a stone.\nThe stone was split from end to end.\nOsman Paşa, the Renowned,\nLive thousands (of years) with your soldiers.\nOsman Paşa, the Renowned,\nLive thousands (of years) with your soldiers.\nDuring the battle, several Ottoman soldiers from Bosnia claimed that Osman had a relationship with a girl from Bosnia only known as \"Đula\". After the battle, returning Bosnian soldiers composed a poem about the suffering of Osman after they lost the battle and how he was sure that he'll never see his girl again. The poem is called \"Zaplakala Šećer Đula\", translated roughly to \"The beautiful Đula started crying\" or more accurately \"The Sweet Rose Wept\". The actual author of the poem is unknown and several people claimed to have written it. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the poem is often played as a Sevdalinka. The Bosnian band \"Divanhana\" made a music video for it.\n\nThe best known version of the poem:\n\nOriginal lyrics, Bosnian language:\n\n\"Zaplakala šećer Đula\"\n\"Osman paše vjerna ljuba\"\n\"Moj Osmane gdje si bio\"\n\"gdje si vojsku izgubio\"\n\n\"Evo mene Đulo mlada\"\n\"ispod Plevna starog grada\"\n\"sto mi care vojske dade\"\n\"sve mi Đulo, za din pade\"\n\n\"Ja sam Đulo ropstva pao\"\n\"britku sablju otpasao\"\n\"pa sad nemam nikog svoga\"\n\"osim Allaha jedinoga\"\n\n\"Đulo mlada preudaj se\"\n\"meni nikad ne nadaj se\"\n\"dušman me je zarobio\"\n\"sa tobom me rastavio\"\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nSweet Djula started to weep,\nOsman's Pasha faithful love.\n\"My Osman, where have you been,\nwhere did you lose your army?\"\n\nHere I am, young Djula,\nbelow the old town of Plevna, \nAll the Army that was given to me my by the Emperor,\nthey all fell down in the name of faith.\n\nI am, Djula, a prisoner now,\nI've surrendered my sharp sword,\nNow I don't have anyone to call my own,\nExcept for God, One and Only.\n\nYoung Djula, go ahead and re-marry,\nDon't ever hope to see me again.\nMy adversary imprisoned me,\nDisunited me from you.\n\n"}
{"id": "1891886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891886", "title": "V for Vendetta (film)", "text": "V for Vendetta (film)\n\nV for Vendetta is a 2005 dystopian political thriller action film directed by James McTeigue and written by the Wachowskis, based on the 1988 DC/Vertigo Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. Set in an alternative future where a Nordic supremacist and neo-fascist Christian totalitarian regime has subjugated the United Kingdom, the film centers on V (portrayed by Hugo Weaving), an anarchist and masked freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, while Natalie Portman plays Evey, a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission and Stephen Rea portrays a detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.\n\nProduced by Silver Pictures, Virtual Studios and Anarchos Productions Inc., \"V for Vendetta\" was originally scheduled for release by Warner Bros. Pictures on November 4, 2005 (a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night), but was delayed; it instead opened in the United States on March 17, 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. However, Alan Moore, having been dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works, \"From Hell\" (2001) and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen \"(2003), declined to watch the film and asked to be uncredited or not be paid royalties.\n\n\"V for Vendetta\" has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; libertarians and anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: \"The Guy Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny – and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.\"\n\nIn 2032, the world is in turmoil.\nThe United Kingdom is ruled by the fascist Norsefire Party, under High Chancellor Adam Sutler.\n\nOn November 4, a vigilante in a Guy Fawkes mask, \"V\", rescues Evey Hammond, an employee of state-run British Television Network, from members of the \"Fingermen\" secret police. They watch his demolition of the Old Bailey, accompanied by fireworks and the \"1812 Overture\". Inspector Finch of Scotland Yard investigates V's activities. V hijacks a BTN broadcast to claim responsibility for the destruction, encouraging the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on next year's Guy Fawkes Night outside the Houses of Parliament. The police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape, but is knocked unconscious.\n\nV takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the Bishop of London. Evey offers to help, but escapes to the home of her boss, talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him, Gordon reveals subversive paintings, an antique Quran, and homoerotic photographs. V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who experimented on him and other \"undesirables\" at Larkhill concentration camp; seeing her remorse, he kills her painlessly.\n\nAfter Gordon satirizes the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is tortured for information about V, her only solace being a note written by Valerie Page, a prisoner tortured and killed for being lesbian. Evey is to be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is released, finding herself in V's home. V captured her at Gordon's home, staging her imprisonment to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He informs her that Gordon was executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realizes she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.\n\nReading Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and is targeting those who detained him. Finch searches for V's true identity, tracing him to a bioweapons program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him about the program. Fourteen years earlier, Sutler, Secretary of Defence at the time, launched a secret project at Larkhill which resulted in the creation of the St. Mary's virus. Creedy, the current leader of the Norsefire Party, suggested releasing the virus onto the UK. Targeting St. Mary's School, a tube station and a water treatment plant, the virus killed more than 100,000 people. The outbreak was blamed on a terrorist organisation. Norsefire used the wave of fear and chaos to elevate Sutler to the office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in Parliament, taking control of the country, as well as profiting off the cure for the virus. Finch discovers that Rookwood was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in the Norsefire government is shaken.\n\nAs November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks, while the population questions government rule. The UK descends into anarchy, ignited when a Fingerman shoots and kills a girl painting graffiti, only to be killed in turn by enraged citizens. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her a train filled with ANFO explosives in the abandoned London Underground, set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal, killing Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, V tells Evey he loves her before dying.\n\nAs Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train off. Thousands of citizens wearing Guy Fawkes masks march toward the Houses of Parliament. As Creedy and Sutler are both dead, the military receives no orders, and allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, \"He was all of us.\"\n\n\n\"V for Vendetta\" sets the Gunpowder Plot as V's historical inspiration, contributing to his choice of timing, language, and appearance. For example, the names Rookwood, Percy and Keyes are used in the film, which are also the names of three of the Gunpowder conspirators. The film creates parallels to Alexandre Dumas's \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", by drawing direct comparisons between V and Edmond Dantès. (In both stories, the hero escapes an unjust and traumatic imprisonment and spends decades preparing to take vengeance on his oppressors under a new persona.) The film is also explicit in portraying V as the embodiment of an idea rather than an individual through V's dialogue and by depicting him without a past, identity or face. According to the official website, \"V's use of the Guy Fawkes mask and persona functions as both practical and symbolic elements of the story. He wears the mask to hide his physical scars, and in obscuring his identity – he becomes the idea itself.\"\n\nAs noted by several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror elements from Gaston Leroux's \"The Phantom of the Opera\". V and the Phantom both wear masks to hide their disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of \"The Phantom of the Opera\", where the masked Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.\n\nAs a film about the struggle between freedom and the state, \"V for Vendetta\" takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including the Third Reich, the Soviet Union under Stalin and George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". For example, Adam Sutler primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, both common features among modern totalitarian regimes and reminiscent of the image of Big Brother. The slogan \"Strength through Unity. Unity through Faith\" is displayed prominently across London, similar in cadence to \"War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength\" in Orwell's book. There is also the state's use of mass surveillance, such as closed-circuit television, on its citizens. The name Adam Sutler is intentionally similar to Adolf Hitler. Like the so-called Führer, Sutler is given to hysterical speech. Also like Hitler, Sutler is a racial purist, although Jews have been replaced by Arabs and Muslims as the focus of Norsefire ethnoreligious propaganda and persecution. (This fact owes to the post-9/11 association of Islam and the Middle East with terrorism, combined with the fact that British Muslims far outnumber British Jews. The latter are certainly persecuted by Norsefire as well, since Norsefire is an Aryanist regime as well as a Christofascistic one.) Valerie was sent to a detention facility for lesbianism and then had medical experiments performed on her, reminiscent of the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.\n\nThe filmmakers added topical references relevant to a 2006 audience. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"With a wealth of new, real-life parallels to draw from in the areas of government surveillance, torture, fear mongering and media manipulation, not to mention corporate corruption and religious hypocrisy, you can't really blame the filmmakers for having a field day referencing current events.\" There are also references to an avian flu pandemic, as well as pervasive use of biometric identification and signal-intelligence gathering and analysis by the regime.\n\nFilm critics, political commentators and other members of the media have also noted the film's numerous references to events surrounding the George W. Bush administration in the United States. These include the hoods and sacks worn by the prisoners in Larkhill that have been seen as a reference to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. The Homeland Security Advisory System and rendition are also referenced. One of the forbidden items in Gordon's secret basement is a protest poster with a mixed US–UK flag with a swastika and the title \"Coalition of the Willing, To Power\" which combines the \"Coalition of the Willing\" with Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of will to power.\n\nDespite the America-specific references, the filmmakers have always referred to the film as adding dialogue to a set of issues much broader than the US administration. When James McTeigue was asked whether or not BTN was based on Fox News Channel, McTeigue replied, \"Yes. But not just Fox. Everyone is complicit in this kind of stuff. It could just as well been the Britain's Sky News Channel, also a part of News Corp.\"\n\nThe film was made by many of the same filmmakers involved in \"The Matrix\" series. In 1988, producer Joel Silver acquired the rights to two of Alan Moore's works: \"V for Vendetta\" and \"Watchmen\". After the release and relative success of \"Road House\", writer Hilary Henkin was brought on to flesh out the project with an initial draft – one that bears little, if any, relation to the finished product, with the inclusion of overtly satirical and surrealistic elements not present in the graphic novel, as well as the removal of much of the novel's ambiguity, especially in regard to V's identity. The Wachowskis were fans of \"V for Vendetta\" and in the mid-1990s, before working on \"The Matrix\", wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel. During the post-production of the second and third \"The Matrix\" films, they revisited the screenplay and offered the director's role to James McTeigue. All three were intrigued by the original story's themes and found them to be relevant to the contemporary political landscape. Upon revisiting the screenplay, the Wachowskis set about making revisions to condense and modernise the story, while at the same time attempting to preserve its integrity and themes. James McTeigue cites the film \"The Battle of Algiers\" as his principal influence in preparing to film \"V for Vendetta\".\n\nMoore explicitly disassociated himself from the film due to his lack of involvement in its writing or directing, as well as due to a continuing series of disputes over film adaptations of his work. He ended cooperation with his publisher, DC Comics, after its corporate parent, Warner Bros., failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the film. Moore said that the script contained plot holes and that it ran contrary to the theme of his original work, which was to place two political extremes (fascism and anarchism) against one another. He argues his work had been recast as a story about \"current American neoconservatism vs. current American liberalism\". Per his wishes, Moore's name does not appear in the film's closing credits. Co-creator and illustrator David Lloyd supports the film adaptation, commenting that the script is very good but that Moore would only ever be truly happy with a complete book-to-screen adaptation.\n\nJames Purefoy was originally cast as V, but left six weeks into filming. Although at the time it was reported this was because of difficulties wearing the mask for the entire film, he has since stated this was not the case. He was replaced by Weaving, who had previously worked with Joel Silver and the Wachowskis on \"The Matrix\" series.\n\nDirector James McTeigue first met Portman on the set of \"\", where he worked as assistant director. In preparation for the role, Portman worked with dialect coach Barbara Berkery to speak in a British accent. She also studied films such as \"The Weather Underground\" and read the autobiography of Menachem Begin. Portman received top billing for the film. Portman's role in the film has parallels to her role in \"\". According to Portman: \"the relationship between V and Evey has a complication [like] the relationship in that film.\" Portman also had her head shaved on camera during a scene where her character is tortured.\n\n\"V for Vendetta\" was filmed in London, England, and in Potsdam, Germany, at Babelsberg Studios. Much of the film was shot on sound stages and indoor sets, with location work done in Berlin for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned London Underground were filmed at the disused Aldwych tube station. Filming began in early March 2005 and lasted through early June 2005. \"V for Vendetta\" is the final film shot by cinematographer Adrian Biddle, who died of a heart attack on December 7, 2005, 4 days prior to its world debut.\n\nTo film the final scene at Westminster, the area from Trafalgar Square and Whitehall up to Parliament and Big Ben had to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5 am. This was the first time the security-sensitive area (home to 10 Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence) had ever been closed to accommodate filming. Prime Minister (at the time of filming) Tony Blair's son, Euan, worked on the film's production and is said (according to an interview with Stephen Fry) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access. This drew criticism of Blair from MP David Davis due to the film's content. However, the filmmakers denied Euan Blair's involvement in the deal, stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with fourteen different government departments and agencies.\n\nThe film was designed to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include \"The Arnolfini Portrait\" by Jan van Eyck, \"Bacchus and Ariadne\" by Titian, a \"Mildred Pierce\" poster, \"St. Sebastian\" by Andrea Mantegna, \"The Lady of Shalott\" by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti.\nOne of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.\n\nThe film's story was adapted from Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel \"V for Vendetta\"; this was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology \"Warrior\", and then reprinted and completed by DC. Moore's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's Vertigo imprint and in the United Kingdom under Titan Books.\n\nThere are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. For example, the comic is set in the 1990s, while the film is set in 2032: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowskis to fit a modern US political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between liberalism and neoconservatism, and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that \"[t]here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to racial purity had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity.\" Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story. Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the \"St. Mary's virus\", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.\n\nMany of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by Fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.\n\nThe film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the then Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England. The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of November 5, 2005, the Plot's 400th anniversary, with the tag line \"Remember, remember the 5th of November\", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event. However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to March 17, 2006. Many have speculated that the delay was caused by the London tube bombing on the July 7 and the failed July 21 bombing. The filmmakers have denied this, saying that the delays were due to the need for more time to finish the visual effects production. \"V for Vendetta\" had its first major premiere on December 11, 2005, at Butt-Numb-A-Thon, followed by a premiere on February 13, 2006 at the Berlin Film Festival. It opened for general release on March 17, 2006 in 3,365 cinemas in the United States, the United Kingdom and six other countries.\n\nThe cast and filmmakers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: \"Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain ... This is a response to the world in which we live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities.\" Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.\n\nThe original graphic novel by Moore and Lloyd was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's original release date of November 5, 2005. The film renewed interest in Alan Moore's original story, and sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States.\n\nA novelisation of the film, written by Steve Moore and based on the Wachowskis' script, was published by Pocket Star on January 31, 2006. Spencer Lamm, who has worked with the Wachowskis, created a \"behind-the-scenes\" book. Titled \"V for Vendetta: From Script to Film\", it was published by Universe on August 22, 2006.\n\n\"V for Vendetta\" was released on DVD in the US on August 1, 2006, in three formats: a single-disc wide-screen version, a single-disc full-screen version, and a two-disc wide-screen special edition. The single disc versions contain a short (15:56) behind-the-scenes featurette titled \"Freedom! Forever! Making V for Vendetta\" and the film's theatrical trailer, whereas the two-disc special edition contains three additional documentaries, and several extra features for collectors. On the second disc of the special edition, a short Easter egg clip of Natalie Portman on \"Saturday Night Live\" can be viewed by selecting the picture of wings on the second page of the menu. The film has also been released on the HD DVD high definition format, which features a unique 'in-film experience' created exclusively for the disc. Warner Bros. later released the video on Blu-ray, on May 20, 2008. The film also saw release on Sony's PSP UMD format.\n\nBy December 2006, \"V for Vendetta\" had grossed $132,511,035, of which $70,511,035 was from the United States. The film led the U.S. box office on its opening day, taking in an estimated $8,742,504, and remained the number one film for the remainder of the weekend, taking in an estimated $25,642,340. Its closest rival, \"Failure to Launch\", took in $15,604,892. The film debuted at number one in the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden and Taiwan. \"V for Vendetta\" also opened in 56 IMAX cinemas in North America, grossing $1.36 million during the opening three days.\n\nDVD sales were successful, selling 1,412,865 DVD units in the first week of release which translated to $27,683,818 in revenue. By the end of 2006, 3,086,073 DVD units had been sold, bringing in slightly more than its production cost with $58,342,597. As of September 2018, the film has grossed over from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the United States.\n\nThe film was also successful in terms of merchandise sales, with hundreds of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks from the film having been sold every year since the film's release, as of 2011. Time Warner owns the rights to the image and is paid a fee with the sale of each official mask.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 73% approval rating based on 248 reviews, with an average rating of 6.78/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Visually stunning and thought-provoking, \"V For Vendetta\" political pronouncements may rile some, but its story and impressive set pieces will nevertheless entertain.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nEbert and Roeper gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating. Roger Ebert stated that \"V for Vendetta\" \"almost always has something going on that is actually interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will\". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from \"At the Movies\" stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany.\n\nJonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a \"woeful, depressing failure\" and stating that the \"cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid the wreckage of the Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue.\" Sean Burns of \"Philadelphia Weekly\" gave the film a 'D', criticizing the film's treatment of its political message as being \"fairly dim, adolescent stuff,\" as well as expressing dislike for the \"barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult.\" On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says \"it's not hard to see why,\" as well as criticising Portman's performance: \"Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance.\"\n\nHarry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film \"works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any/all of the three\". He added that the film will become \"a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age.\" Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is \"a bit of a mess ... it rarely thrills or engages as a story.\"\n\n\"V for Vendetta\" received few awards, although at the 2007 Saturn Awards Natalie Portman won the Best Actress award. The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007. \"V\" was included on \"Fandomania\" list of \"The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters\". \"Empire\" magazine named the film the 418th greatest movie of all time in 2008.\n\n\"V for Vendetta\" deals with issues of totalitarianism, criticism of religion, homosexuality, Islamophobia and terrorism. Its controversial story line and themes have been the target of both criticism and praise from sociopolitical groups.\n\nOn April 17, 2006, the New York Metro Alliance of Anarchists organised a protest against DC Comics and Time Warner, accusing it of watering down the story's original message in favor of violence and special effects. David Graeber, an anarchist scholar and former professor at Yale University, was not upset by the film. \"I thought the message of anarchy got out in spite of Hollywood.\" However, Graeber went on to state: \"Anarchy is about creating communities and democratic decision making. That's what is absent from Hollywood's interpretation.\"\n\nFilm critic Richard Roeper dismissed right-wing Christian criticism of the film on the television show \"Ebert and Roeper\", saying that V's \"terrorist\" label is applied in the film \"by someone who's essentially Hitler, a dictator.\"\n\nLGBT commentators have praised the film for its positive depiction of gay people. Sarah Warn of AfterEllen.com called the film \"one of the most pro-gay ever\". Warn went on to praise the central role of the character Valerie \"not just because it is beautifully acted and well-written, but because it is so utterly unexpected [in a Hollywood film].\"\n\nDavid Walsh of the World Socialist Web Site criticized V's actions as \"antidemocratic,\" calling the film an example of \"the bankruptcy of anarcho-terrorist ideology;\" Walsh writes that because the people have not played any part in the revolution, they will be unable to produce a \"new, liberated society.\"\n\nThe film was broadcast on China's national TV station, China Central Television (CCTV) on December 16, 2012 completely uncensored, surprising many viewers. While many believed that the government had banned the film, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television stated that it was not aware of a ban; CCTV makes its own decisions on whether to censor foreign films. Liu Shanying, a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who used to work for CCTV, speculated that the showing indicated that Chinese film censorship is getting loosened.\n\nThe \"V for Vendetta\" soundtrack was released by Astralwerks Records on March 21, 2006. The original scores from the film's composer, Dario Marianelli, make up most of the tracks on the album. The soundtrack also features three vocals played during the film: \"Cry Me a River\" by Julie London, a cover of The Velvet Underground song \"I Found a Reason\" by Cat Power and \"Bird Gerhl\" by Antony and the Johnsons. As mentioned in the film, these songs are samples of the 872 blacklisted tracks on V's Wurlitzer jukebox that V \"reclaimed\" from the Ministry of Objectionable Materials. The climax of Tchaikovsky's \"1812 Overture\" appears at the end of the track \"Knives and Bullets (and Cannons too)\". The Overture's \"finale\" is played at key parts at the beginning and end of the film.\n\nThree songs were played during the ending credits which were not included on the \"V for Vendetta\" soundtrack. The first was \"Street Fighting Man\" by the Rolling Stones. The second was a special version of Ethan Stoller's \"BKAB\". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from \"On Black Power\" (also in \"A Declaration of Independence\") by black nationalist leader Malcolm X, and from \"Address to the Women of America\" by feminist writer Gloria Steinem were added to the song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: \"This is no simple reform ... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends.\" The final song was \"Out of Sight\" by Spiritualized.\n\nAlso in the film were segments from two of Antonio Carlos Jobim's classic bossa nova songs, \"The Girl From Ipanema\" and \"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\". These songs were played during the \"breakfast scenes\" with V and Deitrich and were one of the ways used to tie the two characters together. Beethoven's \"Symphony No.5\" also plays an important role in the film, with the first four notes of the first movement signifying the letter \"V\" in Morse code. Gordon Deitrich's Benny Hill-styled comedy sketch of Chancellor Sutler includes the \"Yakety Sax\" theme. Inspector Finch's alarm clock begins the morning of November 4 with the song \"Long Black Train\" by Richard Hawley, which contains the foreshadowing lyrics \"Ride the long black train ... take me home black train.\"\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Channel 4 was developing a television series based on the comic book.\n\n\n\n"}

Cell phone towers situated in urban areas are typically not attractive and NIMBY neighbors made those costs higher. The carriers needed wide retail exposure and employed a distribution methodology that included making 'Agents' out of car stereo and alarm stores, car washes and other retailers since early cell phones were not mobile and needed to be installed in a vehicle. The advent of portable cell phones in the marketplace in the early 1990s meant more retailers could participate, since installations were not necessary for portable cell phones.\n\nPhones were distributed through cell phone wholesalers to these retail agents. Eventually, wireless carriers also began limited distribution of portable cellular phones to their 'agents' and retailers. The original membership 'big box' warehouse company, Price Club, located in San Diego, California, wanted to participate in the cellular phone sales for Price Club members. They contacted a cellular wholesaler, Beau Bennett, a San Diego resident and cellular wholesaler and asked to meet with him to discuss their options. In that subsequent meeting, Mr. Bennett showed Price Club buyers a range of portable cell phones and proceeded to layout a method to retail the phones with cell phone displays in Price Club warehouse stores. When the topic of profits arose, Mr. Bennett explained there were two channels of income related to cell phone service and equipment sales. There were adequate and typical profits on equipment and there was also an option for the retailer to participate in the carriers airtime profit. Airtime contracts could pay certain 'agents' as much as $350 and 7% of the customers monthly service bill for your customers, who signed airtime contracts for 2–3 years of cellular service.\n\nPrice Club buyers explained that those profits were 'excessive' according to the corporate enshrined profit limits established by Price Club founders. This profit rejection was an issue that needed to be addressed and Price Club buyers asked Mr. Bennett to try and find a way for them to participate. After considering several options, Mr. Bennett eventually choose to form a third party company, called Cellular Order Desk, to provide trained employees located at an inside kiosk just inside the entrance of the first Price Club location, on Morena Blvd., in San Diego, California. The arrangement Mr. Bennett offered included a smaller profit than originally intended, but within Price Club profit limits, for each cell phone sold.\n\nPrice Club buyers agreed to a one store trial which proved successful and popular with members. Eventually this first store-within-a-store program expanded to 3 additional locations, then to seven locations and eventually to all Price Club stores in Southern California. Price Club and Costco merged in 1993 and the \"first widely known store-within-a-store\" concept was expanded to include those additional warehouse locations in Southern California. Trained Cellular Order Desk employees staffed all stores and provided one-stop shopping for members. A customer could enter a Price Club/Costco warehouse location, choose a cell phone model and have it activated and available for pick-up at the Will Call window on the way out of the store. In those days, every cell phone had a programmable NAM which required pairing the phone ESN to the carriers service. Some early phones were programmed with an electronic NAM writer device, but the handsets sold at Price Club/Costco locations were primarily programmed with the cell phone keypad.\n\nThis agreement is currently popular among filling stations and supermarkets. Many bookshops partner with coffee shops because customers often desire a place to sit and enjoy a drink while they browse. Companies employing this technique include BP/Amoco Sheetz, Exxon Mobil and Hollywood Video with its Game Crazy video-game boutiques.\n\nOften the store-within-a-store is an owned by a manufacturer, operating an outlet within a retail company's store. For example, the American department store Bloomingdale's has had such arrangements with Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, DKNY and Kenneth Cole. Neiman Marcus, another American department store, has had them with Armani and Gucci.\n\nA study by business-school academics found that the arrangement works, because the retailer offers prime locations for which it can charge high rents, the manufacturer makes a higher profit than it would through a wholesale model, and the consumer gets a lower price and better service. The operator of the store-within-a-store can provide these benefits because it receives all profits, instead of having to share them with the retailer, as it would in the traditional split between manufacturer and retailer activities. The study also found that the arrangement works best for relatively non-substitutable goods, like cosmetics and brand fashions.\n"}

It is sometimes called a \"chemical pneumonia\", though it is not infectious. There are two general types of chemical pneumonitis: acute and chronic.\n\nIrritants capable of causing chemical pneumonitis include vomitus, barium used in gastro-intestinal imaging, chlorine gas (among other pulmonary agents), ingested gasoline or other petroleum distillates, ingested or skin absorbed pesticides, gases from electroplating, smoke and others. It may also be caused by the use of inhalants.\nMendelson's syndrome is a type of chemical pneumonitis.\n\nMineral oil should not be given internally to young children, pets, or anyone with a cough, hiatus hernia, or nocturnal reflux, because it can cause complications such as lipoid pneumonia. Due to its low density, it is easily aspirated into the lungs, where it cannot be removed by the body. In children, if aspirated, the oil can work to prevent normal breathing, resulting in death of brain cells and permanent paralysis and/or brain damage.\n\nAcute:\n\nChronic:\nSymptoms of chronic chemical pneumonitis may or may not be present, and can take months or years to develop to the point of noticeability.\nThe pragmatic challenge is to distinguish from aspiration pneumounia with an infectious component because the former does not require antibiotics while the later does. While some issues, such as a recent history of exposure to substantive toxins, can foretell the diagnosis, for a patient with dyphagia the diagnosis may be less obvious, as the dyshagic patient may have caustic gastric contents damaging the lungs which may or may not have progressed to bacterial infection. \n\nThe following tests help determine how severely the lungs are affected:\n\n\nTreatment is focused on reversing the cause of inflammation and reducing symptoms. Corticosteroids may be given to reduce inflammation, often before long-term scarring occurs. Antibiotics are usually not helpful or needed, unless there is a secondary infection. Oxygen therapy may be helpful.\n"}

{"id": "1891903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891903", "title": "Barlow and Chambers execution", "text": "Barlow and Chambers execution\n\nThe Barlow and Chambers executions were the hangings in 1986 by Malaysia of two Westerners, Kevin John Barlow (Australian and British) and Brian Geoffrey Shergold Chambers (Australian) of Perth, Western Australia, for transporting 141.9 g of heroin.\n\nThe two men became the first Westerners to be executed under Malaysia's new tougher laws for drug offences that prescribe death for anyone convicted of having over 15 grams of heroin. Barlow was born in the United Kingdom in Stoke-on-Trent and held dual British and Australian nationalities. Barlow's family made appeals to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher to make a protest about the impending execution, and Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Bill Hayden made an appeal for clemency to the Malaysian government. The executions caused public outcry and strained political relations between Australia and Malaysia at the time.\n\nBetween early 1981 and the end of 1983 Chambers had made at least twelve trips abroad to transport heroin to Australia. In 1980 Chambers imported heroin to Australia using body packing techniques, placing the drugs in his anus. The rest of the load was swallowed. He used the same technique in 1981 when, on transit in Singapore, customs officers detected two vials of personal-use heroin in his jacket pocket. He was released after bribing officers.\n\nChambers and his then girlfriend, Susan Cheryl Jacobsen, decided to move to Melbourne to escape Perth's organised crime scene. Driving intoxicated near Penong, South Australia, Chambers crashed the vehicle. He was not seriously injured; Jacobsen, however, received severe injuries and spent several days in a coma before dying of her injuries on 20 May 1983.\n\nThe drug run was organised by Perth criminal John Asciak. Chambers was enlisted for the job due to his experience in the task. Asciak spent much time at the residence of his girlfriend Debbie Colyer-Long and got to know her boarder, Kevin Barlow. Asciak soon learned Barlow had little money and few prospects for regular work. At the time Barlow was on compensation after injuring himself at work. He was depressed, consuming a lot of alcohol and marijuana after losing his girlfriend. He had also been threatened with the repossession of his car.\n\nThough Barlow and Chambers later testified they were tourists travelling alone who met by chance in Singapore and then opted to travel together, their meeting in Singapore in October 1983 was planned by Asciak. Chambers had previously had a meeting with Barlow in Perth to approve him for the job. To help conceal their activities, Barlow had flown to Singapore directly from Perth, while Chambers had flown there via Sydney. After the Singapore meeting they disobeyed orders by travelling together and sharing the same hotel rooms; they had been directed to stay apart.\n\nBarlow was a novice on his first drug run; he was convinced by organisers that as Chambers was an experienced drug courier the plan would proceed smoothly. Barlow was initially confident the drug run would be successful.\n\nThe proposed drug run had been openly discussed by John Asciak and Kevin Barlow in the household of Debbie Colyer-Long prior to the event. Colyer-Long's brother-in-law Trevor Lawson learned of it and had informed the National Crime Authority of the scheme.\n\nHaving met in Singapore, Barlow and Chambers travelled by train to Penang in Malaysia. The package of drugs had been buried on a beach in Penang. Chambers was given directions to the site and dug up the package. Barlow was present but had not known the location of the heroin.\n\nInitial plans were that Barlow and Chambers conceal the drugs by inserting some packages into their anuses and swallowing the rest. Barlow refused to do either, the former for reasons of distaste, the latter due to health concerns with that method. Chambers relented and placed the several packages of drugs, which were within plastic carry bags and wrapped in newspaper, into a newly purchased maroon suitcase. Barlow had become very nervous after the collection of the drugs.\n\nBarlow and Chambers were observed alighting from the same taxi at Bayan Lepas International Airport on 9 November 1983. Barlow carried the maroon suitcase and entered the airport. He bypassed the luggage scanning area and approached the check-in desk. Chambers, carrying Barlow's bags, paid the taxi, entered the airport and passed through the luggage scanning area, and joined Barlow at the check-in desk. They were detained by police, as Barlow was seen to be very nervous.\n\nTaken to an interview room they were asked to open the suitcases. Chambers opened the bags he was carrying. Barlow said he was unable to open the case he had carried and that it was Chambers' case. Chambers unlocked the case's combination locks and the drugs were found; however, he claimed he had not known the contents of the smaller carry bags the drugs were in.\n\nWhen police handcuffed them, they were reportedly \"shivering terribly\".\n\nThey were imprisoned in Penang Prison for all of 1984 and most of 1985. The prison was overcrowded. Built in 1849 to house up to 350 prisoners, in 1984 it housed 2000 people including women and babies. Barlow and Chambers were locked in a two by three-metre cell together with up to three other prisoners for 22 hours a day, with an exercise period being allowed only if all cellmates had behaved that day. Chambers was well liked in prison; however, Barlow had trouble adjusting, and was described as being a \"lunatic\" and \"cracking up\".\n\nBarlow attempted to excuse his actions by claiming that he had been forced to take the trip and his girlfriend threatened to leave him if he refused.\n\nTheir trial started 17 July 1985 at the High Court of Penang. The trial opened with both men claiming the drugs found in the maroon suitcase belonged to the other. Chambers was represented at the trial by Rasiah Rajasingham and Barlow by Karpal Singh.\n\nChambers remained handcuffed through the trial. Barlow was not cuffed but used crutches due to a groin injury. The arresting officer testified that he saw Barlow holding the maroon suitcase and shivering while waiting to board the plane. The court heard that Chambers had acknowledged ownership of the suitcase two days after the arrest. Chambers testified in court that he didn't know about the drugs in the case, and that Barlow had also used the case. Chambers also testified that Barlow had attempted to bribe a policeman at the airport when the drugs were discovered.\n\nOn 23 July the judge rejected Singh's attempt to have Rajasingham disqualified on grounds that he had received confidential information from Barlow in the nine months before the trial when he acted for both of the accused. The trial concluded 24 July and both men were found guilty. The trial judge deferred pronouncing sentence for a week to enable lawyers of the two men to prepare submissions to him which might be used in an appeal to the Supreme Court of Malaysia, and to hear submissions on behalf of Barlow that he should be allowed to return to Australia immediately for an operation on his leg. The prosecutors surmised that as they had arrived, stayed, and were leaving together, they had a common purpose of trafficking drugs.\n\nOn 1 August 1985 Barlow and Chambers attended their sentencing hearing to learn they had received the death sentence by hanging.\n\nPolice and legal sources confirmed that Chambers at least was the victim of an informer. Prior to his arrest three or four Penang drug dealers had been detained and interrogated about Chambers' movements. The informers' evidence was kept secret at the trial. The drug habits of Barlow and Chambers were likewise not mentioned at the trial as it would have prejudiced their cases, and exposed the heroin trade inside Malaysian prisons.\n\nThey sought an appeal against the original sentence on the grounds that the original trial judge had drawn unwarranted inferences from circumstantial evidence and had erred on several points. Other arguments of the appeal revolved around the credibility of the arresting officer's testimony, and questions of whether Barlow and Chambers acted with a \"common purpose\" in trafficking in the drugs.\n\nOn 15 December 1985 they were transferred to Kuala Lumpur for their appeal to the Malaysian Supreme Court. There they were imprisoned in Pudu Prison. Barlow continued to profess his innocence. Pudu Prison had been built in 1895 to hold about 700. By 1986 it held around 6,000 prisoners, almost 50 of whom were drug dealers sentenced to death.\n\nThe appeal started 16 December 1985. Chambers was represented at the appeal by Perth barrister Ron Cannon. Barlow's lawyer Karpal Singh was assisted by Melbourne barrister Frank Galbally at the appeal. Galbally was accompanied by Allen Bartholomew who was the Victorian Chief Prison Psychiatrist. On 16 December a row broke out between Singh and Galbally in the court room and was witnessed by press and court staff. The argument occurred after the judges had adjourned for the day and left the court, and lasted about five minutes. Galbally had urged Singh to file an additional ground for appeal for their client. Singh had said there was \"little point\" doing this, as no fresh evidence was involved. Galbally believed Barlow's shivering could be attributed to a spinal injury; however, Singh reasoned that this was already adequately covered by medical evidence at the trial and in the existing appeal. At the appeal Singh had argued that Barlow's shivering could be attributed to his existing medical condition, or a foreigner's \"unease\" at being confronted by police. After the argument Singh finally left the room, warning Galbally over his shoulder not to criticise Malaysia's British-based legal system or suggest Australia's was superior. Singh attempted to have Galbally charged with contempt. The day after the row Galbally was asked for, and gave, an apology to the court for his words in court.\n\nThe appeal court on 18 December 1985 upheld the trial judge's decision to invoke the death penalty because the amount of the drug carried was in excess of the 15 gram cut-off point used to distinguish users from traffickers. On death row, Chambers had taken up biblical studies with a Western Catholic Missionary. He broke down and wept in her arms in the dock when three appeals judges upheld the conviction.\n\nGalbally was not in court for the final decision of the appeal; Australian officials reported he had left Malaysia the night of 17 December after apologising to the Supreme Court over the row over contempt. After the result was publicised Galbally suggested that Barlow would have been found not guilty had the medical evidence he wanted introduced been admitted by the court. The evidence he wanted heard at the appeal was that Barlow had a nervous shake; the prosecution had used Barlow's shake at the time of his arrest as grounds for his guilt.\n\nAfter the rejection of their appeal, Australia's Foreign Minister Bill Hayden contacted the Governor of Penang asking that the sentence be commuted to imprisonment on humanitarian grounds. Hayden stated that \"I have always been and remain firmly opposed to capital punishment, and accordingly I will be pressing the presentation of this appeal for clemency with a great sense of urgency.\"\n\nThrough the ordeal of Barlow and Chambers, their mothers, Sue Chambers and Barbara Barlow, publicly supported the defence of innocence. However, in a joint letter to the King of Malaysia Sultan Iskandar pleading for their lives, they acknowledged their sons' guilt, saying they \"regretted their wrongdoing.\"\n\nBarlow and Chambers were hanged in Pudu Prison on 7 July 1986. The executioner was Rajendran Kuppasamy who would retire later that year. Kevin Barlow's mother Barbara Barlow reportedly prepared a suicide potion for her son to enable him to evade death by hanging. She prepared the mixture of 75 sleeping tablets dissolved in gin, whisky and brandy in her hotel room and smuggled it into the prison in a small plastic bottle concealed in her handbag. However, fearing her son would use it before all avenues of appeal had been exhausted she made the last-minute decision to keep the secret solution to herself.\n\nMalaysia had introduced the death penalty for drug trafficking in 1983 as a reaction to a burgeoning drug trade in the region. By mid 1986 Malaysia had hanged about 35 people in ten years, mostly Chinese Malaysians convicted of drug trafficking. Lawyers and government officials reportedly agreed that the country risked a political and ethnic outcry if it made exceptions based on the ethnicity of its defendants. As Australian public support for Barlow and Chambers was minimal, Malaysia risked little diplomatic damage from carrying out the execution.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Bob Hawke made a passionate plea for a stay of execution on behalf of the two men.\n\nHawke later described the hanging as \"barbaric\", a remark which chilled Australian relations with Malaysia. Relations between the two nations were reportedly affected for a decade afterwards. In response to the argument that no one has the right to take another's life, then-Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad replied, \"You should tell that to the drug traffickers.\"\n\nAt a press conference that occurred after the hangings Mahathir criticised the use of the word \"barbaric\" and said it should not have been used to refer to Malaysia because \"we have never had any lynchings and things like that which only barbarians like to do.\" He also said that hanging as a method of executing criminals originated in the West.\n\nThe then UMNO Youth Leader Anwar Ibrahim also said use of the term \"barbaric\" was regrettable. He said \"It is a generative word that passes judgement on our society—something we cannot accept and did not expect from such a friendly country.\" He argued that the consequences of drug trafficking were well known in Malaysia, and the need for strong deterrents to eliminate the activity was accepted internationally.\nThe conference of State Legislative Assembly speakers in Shah Alam also rejected Hawke's comment. They said it gave the impression Australia belittled Malaysian law and \"considers the capital punishment meted out to the two as uncivilised and unsuitable for this day and age.\" The speakers at the conference unanimously passed an emergency resolution expressing their \"grave view\" of the statement. The conference felt that such comments should not have come from a national leader who upheld the law and that the statement had touched on the sovereignty of Malaysia's laws and the legal system.\n\nAfter their sentencing an investigative trip by Detective Sergeant Carl Mengler of the National Crime Authority of Australia had included interviews with various Australians imprisoned in South East Asia for drug trafficking. Chambers had refused to meet him but Barlow gave information about the planning of the trip; however, he knew only sketchy details of the organisers. This meeting took place in January 1986. The information Barlow gave to Mengler during this interview was later corroborated by Debbie Colyer-Long.\n\nAustralian Federal Police denied that they had tipped off Malaysian Police about the claims made by Trevor Lawson.\n\nIn June 1988 in Perth, Western Australia, John Asciak was found guilty of conspiring with Barlow and Chambers to import 179 grams of heroin. He had been implicated by Barlow when he was interviewed in prison by the National Crime Authority of Australia in 1986. The court heard Asciak recruited Barlow, who he knew had financial problems, and offered him $6,000 to conduct the drug run. Barlow was later introduced to Chambers in Perth. Asciak, who denied the charges, was found guilty and sentenced to ten years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Another reason leading to rejection would be the lack of a valid visa. Furthermore, the violation of a law leads to rejection of the request to become a legal resident. In the event of commission of certain enumerated offenses, the asylum seeker will be denied relief.\n\n"}

The song was released in August 1993 as the first single from the album \".\" The last six verses feature a female singer who was credited only as \"Mrs. Loud\" in the album notes. She was later identified as Lorraine Crosby. However, she does not appear in the video, in which her vocals are lip-synched by Dana Patrick. Meat Loaf promoted the single with American singer Patti Russo.\n\nThe power ballad was a commercial success, reaching number one in 28 countries. The single was certified platinum in the United States and became Meat Loaf's first and only number-one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart, and was the best-selling single of 1993 in the United Kingdom. The song earned Meat Loaf a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo.\n\nThe timings in this article refer to the original album version. There are many shorter single and radio edits.\n\nThe song opens with a guitar played to sound like a revving motorcycle. Roy Bittan's piano begins to play along with the guitars and drums. The vocals begin at the 1:50 point. The opening vocals are accompanied by piano and backing vocals. The song then becomes much louder as the band, predominantly piano, plays the main melody for twenty seconds. An instrumental section follows the first verse and chorus, lasting over 45 seconds, with piano playing the title melody, accompanied by guitar and wordless background vocals by Todd Rundgren, Rory Dodd and Kasim Sulton. The lead vocals recommence with another verse. The phrase \"sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll\" was changed to \"Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock and roll\" on the recording, although Meat Loaf occasionally sings the original phrase in concert.\n\nAt the 9:28 point, the song transforms into a duet coda. The structure of the verses remains, but the woman now asks what the man would do. He answers in the affirmative for the first four sections.\n\nThe song's tone changes for the final two sections, in which the woman, Lorraine Crosby on the original recorded version, predicts that the man would eventually do things to upset her and their relationship. Both times, he denies it.\n\nMeat Loaf says that the question, \"What is 'that'?\" is one of the most popular questions he is asked.\n\nEach verse mentions two things that the man would do for love, followed by one thing that he will not do. The title phrase repetition reasserts that he \"won't do that.\" Each mention of \"that\" is a reference to the particular promise that he made earlier in the same verse. The four things he says he will never do are:\n\nAt the song's conclusion, the woman predicts two things that he will do: \"You'll see that it's time to move on\", and \"You'll be screwing around.\" To both of these, the male emphatically responds, \"I won't do that!\"\n\nIn his 1998 \"VH1 Storytellers\" special, Meat Loaf even explained it on stage using a blackboard and a pointing stick. In a 1993 promotional interview, Steinman states that the definition of \"that\" is fully revealed in the song in each of the several verses in which it is mentioned. This sense would have been more clear if the lyric had been \"and I won't do that\" instead of \"but I won't do that.\" It is the use of \"but\" instead of \"and\" that leads to the ambiguity.\nIt sort of is a little puzzle and I guess it goes by - but they're all great things. 'I won't stop doing beautiful things and I won't do bad things.' It's very noble. I'm very proud of that song because it's very much like out of the world of Excalibur. To me, it's like Sir Lancelot or something - very noble and chivalrous. That's my favorite song on the record - it's very ambitious.\n\nMeat Loaf believed that the lyrics were unambiguous, but Steinman predicted that they would cause confusion. An early episode of the VH1 program \"Pop-up Video\" made this claim at the end of the song's video: \"Exactly what Meat Loaf won't do for love remains a mystery to this day.\" A reviewer writing for AllMusic commented that \"The lyrics build suspense by portraying a romance-consumed lover who pledges to do anything in the name of love except 'that,' a mysterious thing that he will not specify.\" Frank O'day says the lyrics provide \"an enlightening example of how listeners project their own thoughts, values, and concerns onto the meaning of the song with misconstrued lyrics.\"\n\nSteinman's songs are usually long, and \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\" is no exception. The song is a full 12 minutes, and Steinman was deeply upset when executives advised him that he had to cut it down to get radio play. Manager Allen Kovac warned that any song over five minutes would not be played on radio, saying that if Steinman and the group did not make the cuts then the stations would. Even after they made the cuts, Steinman sent his own version to the stations.\n\nThe single version was edited down to five minutes and 13 seconds, with the motorcycle introduction omitted. The video version (which also appears on many international releases of the single) was whittled down to seven minutes and 38 seconds, with part of the motorcycle intro remaining. In the video version and single version, the lengthy instrumental break is completely omitted. In the video and single versions, the refrain is abridged as well; Lorraine Crosby sings six verses in the complete song. In the video version, the second and third verses are omitted. In the single version, the second, third, and fifth verses are omitted.\n\nLorraine Crosby, a singer from England, was the guest singer, though AllMusic incorrectly attributes the female vocals to Ellen Foley. Crosby and her partner Stuart Emerson had moved to Los Angeles to work with Steinman, who became their manager. He secured them a contract with Meat Loaf's label MCA. While visiting the company's studios on Sunset Boulevard, Crosby was asked to provide guide vocals for Meat Loaf, who was recording \"I'd Do Anything for Love\". Crosby recalls, \"In I went and sang it twice and I never thought anything more of it until six months later when I got a phone call saying, 'Would you mind if we used your vocals?'\" As Crosby had recorded her part as guide vocals, she received no royalties from the song.\n\nCher, Melissa Etheridge and Bonnie Tyler had been considered for the role. Tyler, who described Crosby as \"a great friend of mine from Newcastle\", said: \"Meat Loaf was naughty, really: he gave her no acknowledgement on the album but I think her part really made that song.\"\n\nMichael Bay directed the music video. He also directed the videos for \"Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are\" and \"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\", also from \"Bat Out of Hell II\". Filming took place in Los Angeles County, California in July 1993; the opening chase was filmed at Chávez Ravine, with the interior mansion scenes filmed at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. The cinematographer was Daniel Pearl, particularly known for filming \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" in 1973. Pearl says that this video \"is one of my personal all-time favorite projects... I think the cinematography is pure, and it tells a story about the song.\"\n\nThe video is based on \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\". Bob Keane did Meat Loaf's make-up, which took up to two hours to apply. The make-up was designed to be simple and scary, yet \"with the ability to make him sympathetic.\" \nIt went over budget, and was filmed in heat, across four days. According to one executive, it \"probably had the budget of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\".\" It is the abridged seven-minute version, rather than the twelve-minute (11:58) album version.\n\nThe actress in the video, Dana Patrick, is miming to Crosby's vocals; she did the same for Patti Russo's vocals in the 1995 song \"I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth)\". According to the captions aired on \"Pop-Up Video\", Patrick received several offers for record deals after the video aired, from executives who assumed she was actually singing in the video.\n\nThe story begins with the opening credits saying: \"I have travelled across the universe through the years to find her. Sometimes going all the way is just a start.\" We then see \"The Beast\" character – a deformed man portrayed by Meat Loaf, on a motorbike being chased by police officers and a helicopter. As the chase continues into night, the Beast passes through into a graveyard and into what appears to be a very ornate mausoleum hiding from his pursuers. He mournfully examines his deformed hands and features; as the officers enter and examine the mausoleum he crashes through the wall with his motorbike and he accidentally knocks down a police officer (whose shotgun goes off) and causes one of the chandeliers on the ceiling to fall and kill the officer.\n\nIn desperation, the Beast flees into the nearby woods where he comes across a beautiful woman bathing/cooling herself by a fountain. The woman appears to be in sunny daylight, while the rest of the woods and castle clearly show that it is night-time. The woman looks into a mirror and glimpses the Beast watching her. She turns and he flees leaving only an amulet hanging on a branch. The woman picks it up and pursues him.\n\nAs she approaches the castle, the Beast is watching her movements through the reflection of his drink. As she comes into the castle, the Beast hurriedly removes himself. The woman sits in his chair and rests by the fire. The Beast watches her from his hall of mirrors and contemplates approaching her but is ashamed of his appearance. She later is seen having a bath interspersed with the police officers finding the dead officer's body and preparing to raid the castle. She is later seen trying to sleep while being seduced by three vampy women while the Beast sits in a chair (a reference to Dracula and the Brides). The Beast leaves the room and, seeing his reflection, begins to smash up the mirrors. The woman, hearing the noise, comes out and follows him into a presumable living room. The Beast observes her from above and levitates the chair she is sitting on.\n\nThe Beast, then hearing the officers are near moves away, pulls the chair back down breaking a lamp. The two run away and the woman removes the Beast's hood so she can look at him clearly. She accepts him and caresses his face while they embrace. As they pull away, the Beast is returned to his human form, and the two disappear just before the police catch them. The woman and the transformed Beast finally ride off into the sunrise on his motorbike.\n\nIn 2013, the song was covered in an M&M's commercial which aired during Super Bowl XLVII.\n\nThe song is featured in the animated comedy \"Sausage Party\" and on its soundtrack. In the film the song is performed by an anthropomorphic meatloaf caricature of the singer.\n\nIt was used in a 2017 commercial for Carvana and in the trailer for the comedy movie \"Blockers\" (2018).\n\nThe song also appeared on the EP \"Fire & Ashes\" by German symphonic metal band Xandria. On this version, Meat Loaf's vocal parts are done by Dianne van Giersbergen, while Lorraine Crosby's vocal parts are done by Valerio Recenti, singer of the Dutch rock band My Propane.\n\nThe single cover is a cropped version of the painting \"Leavetaking\" by fantasy illustrator Michael Whelan, who also painted the \"Bat Out of Hell II\" cover.\n\nThe song reached number one in the charts in 28 countries. In most countries, it was Meat Loaf's first and only number one solo single. It was number one in the US for five weeks and sold over 1.4 million copies there. In the UK, it topped the singles chart, and at seven minutes and 52 seconds, \"I'd Do Anything for Love\" becoming the longest song on top there since The Beatles' hit \"Hey Jude\". This was then broken when Oasis released their 1997 single \"All Around the World\", clocking in at 9 minutes and 20 seconds.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, this was the biggest hit of 1993, selling 761,200 copies and staying at number one for seven weeks. As a result of its success, \"Bat Out of Hell\" was reissued in the UK, this time reaching the top ten (which it did not achieve on its first release in 1979), meaning Meat Loaf achieved the rare feat of having two singles in the UK top ten at the same time.\n\nIn Germany, the song is the seventh best-selling pop hymn ever.\n\nCritical reaction was mixed. AllMusic said that \"Meat Loaf sells the borderline-campy lyrics with a full-throated vocal whose stirring sense of conviction brings out the heart hidden behind the clever phrases.\" Meat Loaf won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo for the song.\n\nBritish adventurer Bear Grylls cites this song as his inspiration to apply for selection into the SAS: \"Enthusiasm and determination count for so much more than skills, brains or qualifications... and all this expressed itself to me through Meatloaf's song!\".\n"}

Bacevich Jr. (born July 5, 1947) is an American historian specializing in international relations, security studies, American foreign policy, and American diplomatic and military history. He is a Professor Emeritus of International Relations and History at the Boston University Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies. He is also a retired career officer in the Armor Branch of the United States Army, retiring with the rank of colonel. He is a former director of Boston University's Center for International Relations (from 1998 to 2005), now part of the Pardee School of Global Studies. Bacevich is the co-founder and president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.\n\nBacevich has been \"a persistent, vocal critic of the U.S. occupation of Iraq, calling the conflict a catastrophic failure.\" In March 2007, he described George W. Bush's endorsement of such \"preventive wars\" as \"immoral, illicit, and imprudent.\" His son, Andrew John Bacevich, also an Army officer, died fighting in the Iraq War in May 2007.\n\nBacevich was born in Normal, Illinois, the son of Martha Ellen (née Bulfer; later Greenis) and Andrew Bacevich, Sr. His father was of Lithuanian descent and his mother was of Irish, German, and English ancestry. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1969 and served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, serving in Vietnam from the summer of 1970 to the summer of 1971.\n\nLater he held posts in Germany, including in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment; the United States; and the Persian Gulf up to his retirement from the service with the rank of colonel in the early 1990s. His early retirement is thought to be a result of his taking responsibility for the Camp Doha (Kuwait) explosion in 1991 while in command of the 11th ACR. He holds a Ph.D. in American Diplomatic History from Princeton University, and taught at West Point and Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty at Boston University in 1998.\n\nOn May 13, 2007, Bacevich's son, Andrew John Bacevich, was killed in action in Iraq by an improvised explosive device south of Samarra in Saladin Governorate. The younger Bacevich, 27, was a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army, assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 8th U.S. Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. Bacevich also has three daughters.\n\nBacevich has described himself as a \"Catholic conservative\" and initially published writings in a number of politically oriented magazines, including \"The Wilson Quarterly\". He advocates for a non-interventionist foreign policy. His recent writings have professed a dissatisfaction with the Bush Administration and many of its intellectual supporters on matters of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nOn August 15, 2008, Bacevich appeared as the guest of \"Bill Moyers Journal\" on PBS to promote his book, \"The Limits of Power.\" As in both of his previous books, \"The Long War\" (2007) and \"The New American Militarism: How Americans are Seduced by War\" (2005), Bacevich is critical of U.S. foreign policy in the post-Cold War era, maintaining the United States has developed an over-reliance on military power, in contrast to diplomacy, to achieve its foreign policy aims. He also asserts that policymakers in particular, and the U.S. people in general, overestimate the usefulness of military force in foreign affairs. Bacevich believes romanticized images of war in popular culture (especially films) interact with the lack of actual military service among most of the U.S. population to produce in the U.S. people a highly unrealistic, even dangerous notion of what combat and military service are really like.\n\nBacevich conceived \"The New American Militarism\" as \"a corrective to what has become the conventional critique of U.S. policies since 9/11 but [also] as a challenge to the orthodox historical context employed to justify those policies.\"\n\nFinally, he attempts to place current policies in historical context, as part of a U.S. tradition going back to the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, a tradition (of an interventionist, militarized foreign policy) which has strong bi-partisan roots. To lay an intellectual foundation for this argument, he cites two influential historians from the 20th century: Charles A. Beard and William Appleman Williams.\n\nUltimately, Bacevich eschews the partisanship of current debate about U.S. foreign policy as short-sighted and ahistorical. Instead of blaming only one president (or his advisors) for contemporary policies, Bacevich sees both Republicans and Democrats as sharing responsibility for policies which may not be in the nation's best interest.\n\nIn March 2003, at the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Bacevich wrote in \"The Los Angeles Times\" that \"if, as seems probable, the effort encounters greater resistance than its architects imagine, our way of life may find itself tested in ways that will make the Vietnam War look like a mere blip in American history.\"\n\nBacevich's book \"American Empire: The Realities and Consequences of US Diplomacy\", published in 2004, was highly praised by Professor of International Relations and author Peter Gowan for being \"a tonic to read: crisp, vivid, pungent, with a dry sense of humour and sharp sense of hypocrisies.\" Gowan describes Bacevich as a \"conservative, who explains that he believed in the justice of America's war against Communism, and continues to do so, but once it was over came to the conclusion that U.S. expansionism both preceded and exceeded the logic of the Cold War, and needed to be understood in a longer, more continuous historical durée.\"\n\nBacevich wrote an editorial about the Bush Doctrine published in the \"Boston Globe\" in March 2007.\n\nIn an article of \"The American Conservative\" dated March 24, 2008, Bacevich depicts Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama as the best choice for conservatives in the fall. Part of his argument includes the fact that \"this liberal Democrat has promised to end the U.S. combat role in Iraq. Contained within that promise, if fulfilled, lies some modest prospect of a conservative revival.\" He also goes on to mention that \"For conservatives to hope the election of yet another Republican will set things right is surely in vain. To believe that President John McCain will reduce the scope and intrusiveness of federal authority, cut the imperial presidency down to size, and put the government on a pay-as-you-go basis is to succumb to a great delusion.\"\n\nIn the October 11, 2009, issue of \"The Boston Globe\", he wrote that the decision to commit more troops to Afghanistan may be the most fateful choice of the Obama administration. \"If the Afghan war then becomes the consuming issue of Obama's presidency – as Iraq became for his predecessor, as Vietnam did for Lyndon Johnson, and as Korea did for Harry Truman – the inevitable effect will be to compromise the prospects of reform more broadly,\" Bacevich wrote.\n\nIn his article \"Non Believer\" in the July 7, 2010, issue of \"The New Republic\", Bacevich compared President George W. Bush, characterized as wrong-headed but sincere, with President Obama, who, he says, has no belief in the Afghanistan war but pursues it for his own politically cynical reasons: \"Who is more deserving of contempt? The commander-in-chief who sends young Americans to die for a cause, however misguided, in which he sincerely believes? Or the commander-in-chief who sends young Americans to die for a cause in which he manifestly does not believe and yet refuses to forsake?\"\n\nIn an October 2010 interview with \"Guernica Magazine\", Bacevich addressed his seemingly contradictory stance on Obama. While Bacevich supported Obama during the 2008 presidential race in which Obama repeatedly said he believed in the Afghanistan war, Bacevich has become increasingly critical of Obama's decision to commit additional troops to that war: \"I interpreted his campaign rhetoric about Afghanistan as an effort to insulate him from the charge of being a national security wimp. His decision to escalate was certainly not a decision his supporters were clamoring for.\"\n\nRegarding nuclear policy in particular, Bacevich noted in \"The Limits of Power\" that there is no feasible scenario under which nuclear weapons could sensibly be used and keeping them entails many other risks: \"For the United States, they are becoming unnecessary, even as a deterrent. Certainly, they are unlikely to dissuade the adversaries most likely to employ such weapons against us – Islamic extremists intent on acquiring their own nuclear capability. If anything, the opposite is true. By retaining a strategic arsenal in readiness (and by insisting without qualification that the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities in 1945 was justified), the United States continues tacitly to sustain the view that nuclear weapons play a legitimate role in international politics ... .\"\n\nBacevich's papers are currently housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1891938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891938", "title": "Great American Interchange", "text": "Great American Interchange\n\nThe Great American Biotic Interchange (commonly abbreviated as GABI), also known as the Great American Interchange or Great American Faunal Interchange, was an important late Cenozoic paleozoogeographic event in which land and freshwater fauna migrated from North America via Central America to South America and vice versa, as the volcanic Isthmus of Panama rose up from the sea floor and bridged the formerly separated continents. Although there were earlier dispersals, probably over water, the migration accelerated dramatically about 2.7 million years (Ma) ago during the Piacenzian age. It resulted in the joining of the Neotropic (roughly South America) and Nearctic (roughly North America) biogeographic realms definitively to form the Americas. The interchange is visible from observation of both biostratigraphy and nature (neontology). Its most dramatic effect is on the zoogeography of mammals but it also gave an opportunity for reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, weak-flying or flightless birds, and even freshwater fish to migrate.\n\nThe occurrence of the interchange was first discussed in 1876 by the \"father of biogeography\", Alfred Russel Wallace. Wallace had spent 1848–1852 exploring and collecting specimens in the Amazon basin. Others who made significant contributions to understanding the event in the century that followed include Florentino Ameghino, W. D. Matthew, W. B. Scott, Bryan Patterson, George Gaylord Simpson and S. David Webb. The Pliocene timing of the formation of the connection between North and South America was discussed in 1910 by Henry Fairfield Osborn.\n\nAnalogous interchanges occurred earlier in the Cenozoic, when the formerly isolated land masses of India and Africa made contact with Eurasia c. 50 and 30 Ma ago, respectively.\n\nAfter the late Mesozoic breakup of Gondwana, South America spent most of the Cenozoic era as an island continent whose \"splendid isolation\" allowed its fauna to evolve into many forms found nowhere else on Earth, most of which are now extinct. Its endemic mammals initially consisted primarily of metatherians (marsupials and sparassodonts), xenarthrans, and a diverse group of native ungulates: notoungulates (the \"southern ungulates\"), litopterns, astrapotheres, pyrotheres and xenungulates. A few non-therian mammals – monotremes, gondwanatheres, dryolestids and possibly cimolodont multituberculates – were also present in the Paleocene; while none of these diversified significantly and most lineages did not survive long, forms like \"Necrolestes\" and \"Patagonia\" remained as recently as the Miocene.\n\nMarsupials appear to have traveled via Gondwanan land connections from South America through Antarctica to Australia in the late Cretaceous or early Tertiary. One living South American marsupial, the monito del monte, has been shown to be more closely related to Australian marsupials than to other South American marsupials; however, it is the most basal australidelphian, meaning that this superorder arose in South America and then colonized Australia after the monito del monte split off. A 61-Ma-old platypus-like monotreme fossil from Patagonia may represent an Australian immigrant. Paleognath birds (ratites and South American tinamous) may made a similar migration around the same time to Australia/New Zealand. Other taxa that may have dispersed by the same route (if not by flying or floating across the ocean) are parrots, chelid turtles and (extinct) meiolaniid turtles.\n\nMarsupials present in South America included didelphimorphs (opossums) and several other small groups; larger predatory relatives of these also existed, like the borhyaenids and the sabertooth \"Thylacosmilus\" (sparassodont metatherians which are no longer considered to be true marsupials). As the large carnivorous metatherians declined, and before the arrival of most types of carnivorans, predatory opossums like \"Thylophorops\" temporarily attained larger size (~7 kg).\n\nMetatherians (and a few xenarthran armadillos like \"Macroeuphractus\") were the only South American mammals to specialize as carnivores; their relative inefficiency created openings for nonmammalian predators to play more prominent roles than usual (similar to the ). Sparassodonts and giant opossums shared the ecological niches for large predators with fearsome flightless \"terror birds\" (phorusrhacids), whose closest extant relatives are the seriemas. (Similar large terrestrial predatory birds, the bathornithids, were found in North America during the early Cenozoic, but they died out in the Early Miocene, about 20 million years ago.) Through the skies over late Miocene South America (6 Ma ago) soared the largest flying bird known, the teratorn \"Argentavis\", with a wing span of 6 m or more, which may have subsisted in part on the leftovers of \"Thylacosmilus\" kills. Terrestrial ziphodont sebecid (metasuchian) crocodyliforms were also present at least through the middle Miocene and maybe to the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. Some of South America's aquatic crocodilians, such as \"Gryposuchus\", \"Mourasuchus\" and \"Purussaurus\", reached monstrous sizes, with lengths up to 12 m (comparable to the largest Mesozoic crocodyliforms). They shared their habitat with one of the largest turtles of all time, the 3.3 m (11 ft) \"Stupendemys\".\n\nXenarthrans are a curious group of mammals that developed morphological adaptations for specialized diets very early in their history. In addition to those extant today (armadillos, anteaters and tree sloths), a great diversity of larger types were present, including pampatheres, the ankylosaur-like glyptodonts, predatory euphractines, various ground sloths, some of which reached the size of elephants (e.g. \"Megatherium\"), and even semiaquatic to aquatic marine sloths.\n\nThe notoungulates and litopterns had many strange forms, like \"Macrauchenia\", a camel-like litoptern with a small proboscis. They also produced a number of familiar-looking body types that represent examples of parallel or convergent evolution: one-toed \"Thoatherium\" had legs like those of a horse, \"Pachyrukhos\" resembled a rabbit, \"Homalodotherium\" was a semi-bipedal clawed browser like a chalicothere, and horned \"Trigodon\" looked like a rhino. Both groups started evolving in the Lower Paleocene, possibly from condylarth stock, diversified, dwindled before the great interchange, and went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. The pyrotheres and astrapotheres were also strange but were less diverse and disappeared earlier, well before the interchange.\n\nThe North American fauna was a typical boreoeutherian one, supplemented with Afrotherian proboscids.\n\nThe invasions of South America started about 40 Ma ago (middle Eocene), when caviomorph rodents arrived in South America. Their subsequent vigorous diversification displaced some of South America's small marsupials and gave rise to – among others – capybaras, chinchillas, viscachas, and New World porcupines. (The independent development of spines by New and Old World porcupines is another example of parallel evolution.) This invasion most likely came from Africa. The crossing from West Africa to the northeast corner of Brazil was much shorter then, due to continental drift, and may have been aided by island hopping (e.g. via St. Paul's Rocks, if they were an inhabitable island at the time) and westward oceanic currents. Crossings of the ocean were accomplished when at least one fertilised female (more commonly a group of animals) accidentally floated over on driftwood or mangrove rafts. (Island-hopping caviomorphs would subsequently colonize the West Indies as far as the Bahamas, reaching the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene.) Over time, some caviomorph rodents evolved into larger forms that competed with some of the native South American ungulates, which may have contributed to the gradual loss of diversity suffered by the latter after the early Oligocene. By the Pliocene, some caviomorphs (e.g., \"Josephoartigasia\") attained sizes on the order of or larger.\n\nLater (by 36 Ma ago) primates followed, again from Africa in a fashion similar to that of the rodents. Primates capable of migrating had to be small. Like caviomorph rodents, South American monkeys are believed to be a clade (i.e., monophyletic). However, although they would have had little effective competition, all extant New World monkeys appear to derive from a radiation that occurred long afterwards, in the Early Miocene about 18 Ma ago. Subsequent to this, monkeys apparently most closely related to titis island-hopped to Cuba, Hispaniola and Jamaica. Additionally, a find of seven 21-Ma-old apparent cebid teeth in Panama suggests that South American monkeys had dispersed across the seaway separating Central and South America by that early date. However, all extant Central American monkeys are believed to be descended from much later migrants, and there is as yet no evidence that these early Central American cebids established an extensive or long-lasting population, perhaps due to a shortage of suitable rainforest habitat at the time.\n\nFossil evidence presented in 2020 indicates a second lineage of African monkeys also rafted to and at least briefly colonized South America. \"Ucayalipithecus\" remains dating from the Early Oligocene of Amazonian Peru are, by morphological analysis, deeply nested within the family Parapithecidae of the Afro-Arabian radiation of parapithecoid simians, with dental features markedly different from those of platyrrhines. The Old World members of this group are thought to have become extinct by the Late Oligocene. \"Qatrania wingi\" of lower Oligocene Fayum deposits is considered the closest known relative of \"Ucayalipithecus\".\n\nRemarkably, the descendants of those few bedraggled waifs that crawled ashore from their rafts of African flotsam in the Eocene now constitute more than twice as many of South America's species as the descendants of all the nonflying mammals previously resident on the continent (372 caviomorph and monkey species versus 136 marsupial and xenarthran species).\n\nMany of South America's bats may have arrived from Africa during roughly the same period, possibly with the aid of intervening islands, although by flying rather than floating. Noctilionoid bats ancestral to those in the neotropical families Furipteridae, Mormoopidae, Noctilionidae, Phyllostomidae, and Thyropteridae are thought to have reached South America from Africa in the Eocene, possibly via Antarctica. Similarly, molossid bats may have reached South America from Africa in as many as five dispersals, starting in the Eocene. Emballonurid bats may have also reached South America from Africa about 30 Ma ago, based on molecular evidence. Vespertilionid bats may have arrived in five dispersals from North America and one from Africa. Natalid bats are thought to have arrived during the Pliocene from North America via the Caribbean.\n\nTortoises also arrived in South America in the Oligocene. It was long thought that they had come from North America, but a recent comparative genetic analysis concludes that the South American genus \"Chelonoidis\" (formerly part of \"Geochelone\") is actually most closely related to African hingeback tortoises. Tortoises are aided in oceanic dispersal by their ability to float with their heads up, and to survive up to six months without food or water. South American tortoises then went on to colonize the West Indies and Galápagos Islands. A number of clades of American geckos seem to have rafted over from Africa during both the Paleogene and Neogene. Skinks of the related genera \"Mabuya\" and \"Trachylepis\" apparently dispersed across the Atlantic from Africa to South America and Fernando de Noronha, respectively, during the last 9 Ma. Surprisingly, South America's burrowing amphisbaenians and blind snakes also appear to have rafted from Africa, as does the hoatzin, a weak-flying bird of South American rainforests.\n\nThe earliest traditionally recognized mammalian arrival from North America was a procyonid that island-hopped from Central America before the isthmus of Panama land bridge formed, around 7.3 Ma ago. This was South America's first eutherian carnivore. South American procyonids then diversified into forms now extinct (e.g. the \"dog-coati\" \"Cyonasua\", which evolved into the bear-like \"Chapalmalania\"). However, all extant procyonid genera appear to have originated in North America. It has been suggested that the first South American procyonids may have contributed to the extinction of sebecid crocodilians by eating their eggs, but this view has not been universally viewed as plausible. The procyonids were followed to South America by rafting/island-hopping hog-nosed skunks and sigmodontine rodents. The oryzomyine tribe of sigmodontine rodents went on to colonize the Lesser Antilles up to Anguilla.\n\nOne group has proposed that a number of large Neartic herbivores actually reached South America as early as 9–10 Ma ago, in the late Miocene, via an early incomplete land bridge. These claims, based on fossils recovered from rivers in southwestern Peru, have been viewed with caution by other investigators, due to the lack of corroborating finds from other sites and the fact that almost all of the specimens in question have been collected as float in rivers without little to no stratigraphic control. These taxa are: a gomphothere (\"Amahuacatherium\"), peccaries (\"Sylvochoerus\" and \"Waldochoerus\"), tapirs and a palaeomerycid (from a family probably ancestral to cervids), \"Surameryx\". The identification of \"Amahuacatherium\" and the dating of its site is controversial; it is regarded by a number of investigators as a misinterpreted fossil of a different gomphothere, \"Notiomastodon\", and biostratigraphy dates the site to the Pleistocene. The early date proposed for \"Surameryx\" has also been met with skepticism.\n\nMegalonychid and mylodontid ground sloths island-hopped to North America by 9 Ma ago. A basal group of sloths had colonized the Antilles previously, by the early Miocene. (Megatheriid and nothrotheriid ground sloths did not migrate north until the formation of the isthmus.) Terror birds may have also island-hopped to North America as early as 5 Ma ago.\n\nThe Caribbean islands were populated primarily by species from South America. This was due to the prevailing direction of oceanic currents, rather than to a competition between North and South American forms. (Except in the case of Jamaica, oryzomyine rodents of North American origin were able to enter the region only after invading South America.)\n\nThe formation of the Isthmus of Panama led to the last and most conspicuous wave, the great interchange, starting around 2.7 Ma ago. This included the immigration into South America of North American ungulates (including camelids, tapirs, deer and horses), proboscids (gomphotheres), carnivorans (including felids like cougars and saber-toothed cats, canids, mustelids, procyonids and bears) and a number of types of rodents. The larger members of the reverse migration, besides ground sloths and terror birds, were glyptodonts, pampatheres, capybaras and the notoungulate \"Mixotoxodon\" (the only South American ungulate known to have invaded Central America).\nIn general, the initial net migration was symmetrical. Later on, however, the Neotropic species proved far less successful than the Nearctic. This difference in fortunes was manifested in several ways. Northwardly migrating animals often were not able to compete for resources as well as the North American species already occupying the same ecological niches; those that did become established were not able to diversify much, and in some cases did not survive for long. Southwardly migrating Nearctic species established themselves in larger numbers and diversified considerably more, and are thought to have caused the extinction of a large proportion of the South American fauna. (There were no extinctions in North America plainly linked to South American immigrants.) Native South American ungulates did poorly, with only a handful of genera withstanding the northern onslaught. (It has long been recognized that several of the largest forms, macraucheniids and toxodontids, survived to the end of the Pleistocene. Recent fossil finds indicate that one species of the horse-like proterotheriid litopterns did as well. The notoungulate mesotheriids and hegetotheriids also managed to hold on at least part way through the Pleistocene.) On the other hand, South America's small marsupials survived in large numbers, while the primitive-looking xenarthrans proved to be surprisingly competitive and became the most successful invaders of North America. The African immigrants, the caviomorph rodents and platyrrhine monkeys, were less impacted by the interchange than most of South America's 'old-timers', although the caviomorphs suffered a significant loss of diversity, including the elimination of the largest forms (e.g. the dinomyids). With the exception of the North American porcupine and several extinct porcupines and capybaras, however, they did not migrate past Central America.\n\nDue in large part to the continued success of the xenarthrans, one area of South American ecospace the Nearctic invaders were unable to dominate was the niches for megaherbivores. Before 12,000 years ago, South America was home to about 25 species of herbivores weighing more than 1000 kg, consisting of Neotropic ground sloths, glyptodonts and toxodontids, as well as gomphotheres and camelids of Nearctic origin. Native South American forms made up about 75% of these species. However, none of these megaherbivores have survived.\nArmadillos, opossums and porcupines are present in North America today because of the Great American Interchange. Opossums and porcupines were among most successful northward migrants, reaching as far as Canada and Alaska, respectively. Most major groups of xenarthrans were present in North America up until the end-Pleistocene Quaternary extinction event (as a result of at least eight successful invasions of temperate North America, and at least six more invasions of Central America only). Among the megafauna, ground sloths were notably successful emigrants; four different lineages invaded North America. A megalonychid representative, \"Megalonyx\", spread as far north as the Yukon and Alaska, and might well have invaded Eurasia had a suitable habitat corridor across Beringia been present.\n\nGenerally speaking, however, the dispersal and subsequent explosive adaptive radiation of sigmodontine rodents throughout South America (leading to ) was vastly more successful (both spatially and by number of species) than any northward migration of South American mammals. Other examples of North American mammal groups that diversified conspicuously in South America include canids and cervids, both of which currently have 3 or 4 genera in North America, 2 or 3 in Central America, and 6 in South America. Although members of \"Canis\" (specifically, coyotes) currently range only as far south as Panama, of canids than any other continent.\n\nThe effect of formation of the isthmus on the marine biota of the area was the inverse of its effect on terrestrial organisms, a development that has been termed the \"Great American Schism\". The connection between the east Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean (the Central American Seaway) was severed, setting now-separated populations on divergent evolutionary paths. Caribbean species also had to adapt to an environment of lower productivity after the inflow of nutrient-rich water of deep Pacific origin was blocked. The Pacific coast of South America cooled as the input of warm water from the Caribbean was cut off. This trend is thought to have caused the extinction of the marine sloths of the area.\n\nDuring the last 7 million years, South America's terrestrial predator guild has changed from one composed almost entirely of nonplacental mammals (metatherians), birds and reptiles to one dominated by immigrant placental carnivorans (with a few small marsupial and avian predators like didelphine opossums and seriemas). It was originally thought that the native South American predator guild, including sparassodonts, carnivorous opossums like \"Thylophorops\" and \"Hyperdidelphys\", armadillos such as \"Macroeuphractus\", terror birds, and teratorns, as well as early-arriving immigrant \"Cyonasua\"-group procyonids, were driven to extinction during the GAI by competitive exclusion from immigrating placental carnivorans, and that this turnover was abrupt. However, research has shown that the turnover of South America's predator guild was more complex with competition only playing a limited role.\n\nIn the case of sparassodonts and carnivorans, which has been the most heavily studied, there is little evidence that sparassodonts even encountered their hypothesized placental competitors. Many supposed Pliocene records of South American carnivorans have turned out to be misidentified or misdated. Sparassodonts appear to have been declining in diversity since the middle Miocene, with many of the niches once occupied by small sparassodonts being increasingly occupied by carnivorous opossums, which reached sizes of up to ~8 kg. Whether sparassodonts competed with carnivorous opossums or whether opossums began occupying sparassodont niches through passive replacement is still debated. Borhyaenids last occur in the late Miocene, approximately four million years before the first appearance of canids or felids in South America. Thylacosmilids last occur about 3 million years ago and appear to be rarer at pre-GABI Pliocene sites than Miocene ones.\n\nIn general, sparassodonts appear to have been mostly or entirely extinct by the time most nonprocyonid carnivorans arrived, with little overlap between the groups. Purported ecological counterparts between pairs of analogous groups (thylacosmilids and saber-toothed cats, borhyaenids and felids, hathliacynids and weasels) neither overlap in time nor abruptly replace one another in the fossil record. Procyonids dispersed to South America by at least (~7 million years ago), and had achieved a modest endemic radiation by the time other carnivorans arrived (\"Cyonasua\"-group procyonids). However, procyonids do not appear to have competed with sparassodonts, the procyonids being large omnivores and sparassodonts being primarily hypercarnivorous. Other groups of carnivorans did not arrive in South America until much later. Dogs and weasels appear in South America about 2.9 million years ago but do not become abundant or diverse until the early Pleistocene. Bears, cats, and skunks do not appear in South America until the early Pleistocene (~1 million years ago or slightly earlier). Otters and other groups of procyonids (i.e., coatis, raccoons) have been suggested to have dispersed to South America in the Miocene based on genetic data, but no remains of these animals have been found even at heavily-sampled northern South American fossil sites like La Venta (Colombia), which is only 600 km from the Isthmus of Panama.\n\nOther groups of native South American predators have not been studied in as much depth. Terror birds have often been suggested to have been driven to extinction by placental carnivorans, though this hypothesis has not been investigated in detail. \"Titanis\" dispersed from South America to North America against the main wave of carnivoran migrations, being the only large native South American carnivore to accomplish this. However, it only managed to colonize a small part of North America for a limited time, failing to diversify and going extinct in the early Pleistocene (1.8 million years ago); the modest scale of its success has been suggested to be due to competition with placental carnivorans. Terror birds also decline in diversity after about 3 million years ago. At least one genus of relatively small terror birds, \"Psilopterus\", appears to have survived to as recently as ~96,000 years ago.\n\nThere appears to be a complete collapse of the native carnivore guild approximately 3 million years ago (including the extinction of the last sparassodonts), not correlated with the arrival of carnivorans in South America, with terrestrial carnivore diversity being low thereafter. This has been suggested to have opened up ecological niches and allowed carnivorans to establish themselves in South America due to low competition. A meteor impact 3.3 million years ago in southern South America has been suggested as a possible cause of this turnover, but this is still controversial. A similar pattern occurs in the crocodilian fauna, where modern crocodiles (\"Crocodylus\") dispersed to South America during the Pliocene and became the dominant member of crocodilian communities after the late Miocene extinction of the previously dominant large native crocodilians such as the giant caiman \"Purussaurus\" and giant gharial \"Gryposuchus\", which is thought to be related to the loss of wetlands habitat across northern South America.\n\nWhether this revised scenario with a reduced role for competitive exclusion applies to other groups of South American mammals such as notoungulates and litopterns is unclear, though some authors have pointed out a protracted decline in South American native ungulate diversity since the middle Miocene. Regardless of how this turnover happened it is clear that carnivorans benefitted from it. Several groups of carnivorans such as dogs and cats underwent an adaptive radiation in South America after dispersing there and the greatest modern diversity of canids in the world is in South America.\n\nThe eventual triumph of the Nearctic migrants was ultimately based on geography, which played into the hands of the northern invaders in two crucial respects. The first was a matter of climate. Any species that reached Panama from either direction obviously had to be able to tolerate . Those migrating southward would then be able to occupy much of South America without encountering climates that were markedly different. However, northward migrants would have encountered drier and/or cooler conditions by the time they reached the vicinity of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The challenge this climatic asymmetry (see map on right) presented was particularly acute for Neotropic species specialized for tropical rainforest environments, who had little prospect of penetrating beyond Central America. As a result, Central America currently has 41 mammal species of Neotropical origin, compared to only 3 for temperate North America. However, species of South American origin (marsupials, xenarthrans, caviomorph rodents and monkeys) still comprise only 21% of species from nonflying, nonmarine mammal groups in Central America, while North American invaders constitute 49% of species from such groups in South America. Thus, climate alone cannot fully account for the greater success of species of Nearctic origin during the interchange.\n\nThe second and more important advantage geography gave to the northerners is related to the land area available for their ancestors to evolve in. During the Cenozoic, North America was periodically connected to Eurasia via Beringia, allowing repeated migrations back and forth to unite the faunas of the two continents. Eurasia was connected in turn to Africa, which contributed further to the species that made their way to North America. South America, on the other hand, was connected only to Antarctica and Australia, two much smaller and less hospitable continents, and only in the early Cenozoic. Moreover, this land connection does not seem to have carried much traffic (apparently no mammals other than marsupials and perhaps a few monotremes ever migrated by this route), particularly in the direction of South America. This means that Northern Hemisphere species arose over a land area roughly six times greater than was available to South American species. North American species were thus products of a larger and more competitive arena, where evolution would have proceeded more rapidly. They tended to be more efficient and brainier, generally able to outrun and outwit their South American counterparts, who were products of an evolutionary backwater. In the cases of ungulates and their predators, South American forms were replaced wholesale by the invaders, possibly a result of these advantages.\n\nThe greater eventual success of South America's African immigrants compared to its native early Cenozoic mammal fauna is another example of this phenomenon, since the former evolved over a greater land area; their ancestors migrated from Eurasia to Africa, two significantly larger continents, before finding their way to South America.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the ability of South America's xenarthrans to compete effectively against the northerners represents a special case. The explanation for the xenarthrans' success lies in part in their idiosyncratic approach to defending against predation, based on possession of body armor and/or formidable claws. The xenarthrans did not need to be fleet-footed or quick-witted to survive. Such a strategy may have been forced on them by their low metabolic rate (the lowest among the therians). Their low metabolic rate may in turn have been advantageous in allowing them to subsist on less abundant and/or less nutritious food sources. Unfortunately, the defensive adaptations of the large xenarthrans would have offered little protection against humans armed with spears and other projectiles.\n\nAt the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 12,000 years ago, three dramatic developments occurred in the Americas at roughly the same time (geologically speaking). Paleoindians invaded and occupied the New World, the last glacial period came to an end, and a large fraction of the megafauna of both North and South America went extinct. This wave of extinctions swept off the face of the Earth many of the successful participants of the Great American Interchange, as well as other species that had not migrated.\n\nAll the pampatheres, glyptodonts, ground sloths, equids, proboscids, giant short-faced bears, dire wolves and machairodont species of both continents disappeared. The last of the South and Central American notoungulates and litopterns died out, as well as North America's giant beavers, lions, dholes, cheetahs, and many of its antilocaprid, bovid, cervid, tapirid and tayassuid ungulates. Some groups disappeared over most or all of their original range but survived in their adopted homes, e.g. South American tapirs, camelids and tremarctine bears (cougars and jaguars may have been temporarily reduced to South American refugia also). Others, such as capybaras, survived in their original range but died out in areas they had migrated to. Notably, this extinction pulse eliminated all Neotropic migrants to North America larger than about 15 kg (the size of a big porcupine), and all native South American mammals larger than about 65 kg (the size of a big capybara or giant anteater). In contrast, the largest surviving native North American mammal, the wood bison, can exceed 900 kg, and the largest surviving Nearctic migrant to South America, Baird's tapir, can reach 400 kg.\n\nThe near-simultaneity of the megafaunal extinctions with the glacial retreat and the peopling of the Americas has led to proposals that both climate change and human hunting played a role. Although the subject is contentious, a number of considerations suggest that human activities were pivotal. The extinctions did not occur selectively in the climatic zones that would have been most affected by the warming trend, and there is no plausible general climate-based megafauna-killing mechanism that could explain the continent-wide extinctions. The climate change took place worldwide, but had little effect on the megafauna in areas like Africa and southern Asia, where megafaunal species had coevolved with humans. Numerous had occurred previously within the ice age of the last several Ma without ever producing comparable waves of extinction in the Americas or anywhere else.\n\nSimilar megafaunal extinctions have occurred on other recently populated land masses (e.g. Australia, Japan, Madagascar, New Zealand, and many smaller islands around the world, such as Cyprus, Crete, Tilos and New Caledonia) at different times that correspond closely to the first arrival of humans at each location. These extinction pulses invariably swept rapidly over the full extent of a contiguous land mass, regardless of whether it was an island or a hemisphere-spanning set of connected continents. This was true despite the fact that all the larger land masses involved (as well as many of the smaller ones) contained multiple climatic zones that would have been affected differently by any climate changes ongoing at the time. However, on sizable islands far enough offshore from newly occupied territory to escape immediate human colonization, megafaunal species sometimes survived for many thousands of years after they or related species became extinct on the mainland; examples include giant kangaroos in Tasmania, giant \"Chelonoidis\" tortoises of the Galápagos Islands (formerly also of South America), giant \"Dipsochelys\" tortoises of the Seychelles (formerly also of Madagascar), giant meiolaniid turtles on Lord Howe Island, New Caledonia and Vanuatu (previously also of Australia), ground sloths on the Antilles, Steller's sea cows off the Commander Islands and woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island and Saint Paul Island.\n\nThe glacial retreat may have played a primarily indirect role in the extinctions in the Americas by simply facilitating the movement of humans southeastward from Beringia down to North America. The reason that a number of groups went extinct in North America but lived on in South America (while there are no examples of the opposite pattern) appears to be that the dense rainforest of the Amazon basin and the high peaks of the Andes provided environments that afforded a degree of protection from human predation.\n\nExtant or extinct (†) North American taxa whose ancestors migrated out of South America:\n\nFish\nAmphibians\nBirds\nMammals\n\nExtant or extinct (†) Central American taxa whose ancestors migrated out of South America:\n\nInvertebrates\nFish\nAmphibians\nReptiles\nBirds\nMammals\n\nExtant or extinct (†) South American taxa whose ancestors migrated out of North America (considered as including Central America):\n\nAmphibians\nReptiles\nBirds\nMammals\n\n\n"}

It is situated about southwest of the state capital Chennai and about southeast of Tiruchirappalli. The people in the city are employed majorly in teritiary sector activities. Tamil Nadu's first women Asiad Santhi Soundarajan is from Pudukkottai.\n\nBeing the district headquarters, Pudukkottai accommodates the district administration offices, government educational institutes, colleges, and schools.

The next ruler, Raja Vijaya Reghunatha Raya Thondaiman, helped the Arcot Nawab against Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore. He was also loyal to the British Government. After some time, when Hyder Ali's army tried to enter Pudukkottai, Thondaiman's army defeated them and drove Hyder's army away. Thondaiman captured Kilanilai and Aranthangi. He helped the British government against Tipu Sultan.\n\nPudukkotai finally came under formal British protection. This was arguably unavoidable since the Thondaimans were much menaced in that period by a resurgent Mysore, ruled by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. When Tipu Sultan sought to leverage the power of the French against his British adversaries, Pudukkotai, in common with its neighbors, such as Thanjavur and Travancore, found it expedient to ally with the British.\n\nRaja Rajagopala Thondaiman (1928–1948), the last and ninth in the line of Thondaiman rulers, was selected by the British Government and was crowned when he was six years old. After Indian independence in 1947, the Pudukkottai Princely State was amalgamated with the Indian Union on 3 April 1948 and became a division in Tiruchirappalli District.

In the perspective of family, marriage can bring families of different surnames (different clans) together, and continue the family life of the concerned clans. Therefore, only the benefits and demerits of the clans, instead of the individual couples, are concerned in a marriage. Socially, a married couple is the basic unit of the population; sometimes marriages can affect the country's political stability and international relations (especially to certain foreign tribes like Mongolians, Manchus, Huns, and Turks); thus marriage can be related to politics.\n\nFrom the point of view of Confucian philosophy, one of the purposes of marriage is the cultivation of virtue. The Chinese have seen that marriage () should be founded on love since the concept of monogamy is rooted in their mindset. Ideographically, ‘’hūn’’ (婚) is identical to ‘’hūn’’ (昏, literally means an evening; a dusk) in ancient writings, though the former has the radical (Chinese character) ‘’nǔ’’ (女, literally means a female). Similarly, ‘’yīn’’ (姻) is the same as ‘’yīn’’ (因). According to Zhang Yi’s (張揖) (), a dictionary for ancient Chinese characters, ‘’yīn’’ (因) means friendliness, love and harmony, indicating that correct way of living for a married couple.\n\nDue to the concept of filial piety and following rites of propriety, marriage was a costly affair and seen as second only to funeral ceremonies. The use of a matchmaker was meant to ensure that the husband and wife were compatible with each other, but primarily worked in the families' best interests.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1891996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891996", "title": "Tobamovirus", "text": "Tobamovirus\n\nTobamovirus is a genus in the virus family \"Virgaviridae\". Many plants, including tobacco, potato, tomato, and squash, serve as natural hosts. There are currently 37 species in this genus including the type species \"Tobacco mosaic virus\". Diseases associated with this genus include: necrotic lesions on leaves. The name \"Tobamovirus\" comes from the host and symptoms of the first virus discovered (\"Tobacco mosaic virus\").\n\nThere are four informal subgroups within this genus: these are the tobamoviruses that infect the brassicas, the cucurbits, and malvaceous and solanaceous plants. The main differences between these groups are genome sequences, and respective range of host plants.\n\nThese viruses are thought to have codiverged with their hosts from a common ancestor. There are at least 3 distinct clades of tobamoviruses, which to some extent follow their host ranges: that is, there is one infecting solanaceous species; a second infecting cucurbits and legumes and a third infecting the crucifers.\n\nThe RNA genome encodes at least four polypeptides: these are the non-structural protein and the read-through product which are involved in virus replication (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp); the movement protein (MP) which is necessary for the virus to move between cells and the coat protein (CP). The read-through portion of the RdRp may be expressed as a separate protein in TMV. The virus is able to replicate without the movement or coat proteins, but the other two are essential. The non-structural protein has domains suggesting it is involved in RNA capping and the read-through product has a motif for an RNA polymerase. The movement proteins are made very early in the infection cycle and localized to the plasmodesmata, they are probably involved in host specificity as they are believed to interact with some host cell factors.\n\nTobamoviruses are non-enveloped, with helical rod geometries, and helical symmetry. The diameter is around 18 nm, with a length of 300-310 nm. Genomes are linear and non-segmented, around 6.3-6.5kb in length.\n\nViral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by suppression of termination. The virus exits the host cell by monopartite non-tubule guided viral movement.\nPlants serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are mechanical.\n\nThe infection is localized to begin with but if the virus remains unchallenged it will spread via the vascular system into a systemic infection. The exact mechanism the virus uses to move throughout the plant is unknown but the interaction of pectin methylesterase, a cellular enzyme important for cell wall metabolism and plant development, with the movement protein has been implicated.\n\n\n"}

The lyrics were inspired by the 1946 aggravated assault and blinding of World War II veteran Isaac Woodard in a county jail in South Carolina. The song mistakenly references Aiken, SC, as the location of this savage beating. Batesburg, SC, a small textile milling town nearly 30 miles to the northeast served as the actual location of the incident which sparked a major civil rights issue. The song title appears to be a reference to the biblical tale of the Binding of Isaac.\n\nGuthrie later wrote, \"\"I sung this Isaac Woodard song in the Lewisohn Stadium one night for more than 36,000 people, and I got the loudest applause I've ever got in my whole life. This song is a long song, but most of the action is told in Isaac's own words. I made this ballad up because we'll need lots of songs like this one before we win our fight for racial equality in our big free United States.\"\" \n\n"}

The world's longest red carpet measures and was exposed and used in the streets of the city of Almería, Spain. Such a feat served the city of southern Spain got into The Guinness Book of Records.\n\nThe earliest known reference to walking a red carpet in literature is in the play \"Agamemnon\" by Aeschylus, written in 458 BC. When the title character returns from Troy, he is greeted by his wife Clytemnestra who offers him a red path to walk upon:\n\nNow my beloved, step down from your chariot, and let not your foot, my lord, touch the Earth. Servants, let there be spread before the house he never expected to see, where Justice leads him in, a crimson path.\n\nAgamemnon, knowing that only gods walk on such luxury, responds with trepidation:\n\nI am a mortal, a man; I cannot trample upon these tinted splendors without fear thrown in my path.\n\nOriental carpets in Renaissance painting often show rugs and carpets, patterned but with red often the main background colour, laid on the steps to a throne, or on a dais where rulers or sacred figures are placed.\n\nA red carpet was rolled out to a river to welcome the arrival of United States president James Monroe in 1821. In 1902, the New York Central Railroad used plush crimson carpets to direct people as they boarded their \"20th Century Limited\" passenger train. This is believed to be the origin of the phrase \"red-carpet treatment\".\n\nFilm premieres are often laid down with red carpets, but wasn't until the 1920s that the red carpet and Hollywood became truly synonymous. The crimson-hued carpet was unfurled for the Hollywood premiere of Robin Hood, starring Douglas Fairbanks, in front of the Egyptian Theatre in 1922. And for the following decades, there were only few places where the public could catch a glimpse of charismatic stars like Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, and the red carpet was one of them.\n\nThen, in 1961, the red carpet was introduced at the Academy Awards at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. A few years later, the broadcasters of the ceremony opted to film outside the venue, showing the arrival of guests as they stepped out of their limousines. From this point in 1964, the red carpet became a globally acknowledged focal point for actors and actresses to make a grand entrance and showcase themselves at the Oscars.\n\nA red carpet is also used in gala celebrity events such as the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, Grammy Awards, Met Gala, and BAFTAs. While the awards take place inside, much of the publicity and excitement takes place outside with journalists discussing the red carpet fashions, what designers are being worn by which stars and photographers taking pictures. This is now a spectacular international product placement arena of great importance to the fashion industry. Red carpets are often coupled with publicity backdrops which contain brand logos or emblems for photography purposes.\n\nCarpeting in other colors may replace red in some instances to honor a certain cause or for a sponsored event, the sponsor's logo colors, such as a \"green carpet\" to promote environmental awareness, or for the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, an orange carpet is used instead to go with the network's primary imaging color. MTV uses a blue colored carpet for their Video Music Awards. The premiere of the film Detective Pikachu used a yellow carpet to match the color of the lead character.\n\nIn some countries such as South Africa and the Philippines, a red carpet is laid for members of parliament and other guests entering the joint session, allowing a showcase of fashion for politicians.\n\nMore generally, \"red carpet treatment\" and \"rolling out the red carpet\" usually refer to any special efforts made in the interests of hospitality.\n\nUnited Airlines operates a series of airport lounges at major airports that were formerly known as \"Red Carpet Clubs\".\n\n"}

He was educated at Loudun and afterwards at Paris. From his earliest years he devoted himself to historical and geographical research, and his first work, \"Egregiarum seu selectarum lectionum et antiquitatum liber\", published in his eighteenth year, displayed great erudition. He enjoyed the patronage of Cardinal Richelieu, a native of the same district with himself, through whose influence he was appointed historiographer and geographer to the king.\n\nHe died in Paris in 1640, in consequence of having been run over by a carriage when on his way from the city to his country house at Verrières.\n\nDuchesne's works were very numerous and varied, and in addition to what he published, he left behind him more than 100 folio volumes of manuscript extracts now preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale (L.

Wilson, which stood on the historic McCorkle Place of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) from 1913 until it was pulled down by protestors in 2018. Its former location has been described as \"the front door\" of the university and \"a position of honor\".\n\nEstablishing a Confederate monument at a Southern university became a goal of the North Carolina chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) in 1907. UNC approved the group's request in 1908 and, with funding from UNC alumni, the UDC and the university, Wilson designed the statue, using a young Boston man as his model. At the unveiling on June 2, 1913, local industrialist and UNC Trustee Julian Carr gave a speech espousing white supremacy, while Governor Locke Craig, UNC President Francis Venable and members of the UDC praised the sacrifices made by students who volunteered to fight for the Confederacy.\n\nThe program for the unveiling simply referred to the statue as \"the Confederate Monument\", with the name \"Soldiers Monument\" also being used around the same time. The name \"Silent Sam\" is first recorded in 1954, in the student newspaper \"The Daily Tar Heel\".\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, the statue faced opposition on the grounds of its racist message, and it was vandalized several times. Protests and calls to remove the monument reached a higher profile in the late 2010s, and in 2018 UNC Chancellor Carol L. Folt described the monument as detrimental to the university, and said that she would have the statue removed if not prohibited by state law. Increased protests and vandalism resulted in the university spending $390,000 on security and cleaning for the statue in the 2017–18 academic year.\n\nIn August 2018, \"Silent Sam\" was toppled by protesters, and later that night removed to a secure location by university authorities. A statement from Chancellor Folt said the statue's original location was \"a cause for division and a threat to public safety,\" and that she was seeking input on a plan for a \"safe, legal and alternative\" new location.\n\nThe UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees made a recommendation in December 2018 for a new \"University History and Education Center\" to be built on campus, at an estimated cost of $5.3 million, but this was rejected by the university system's Board of Governors. The pedestal base and inscription plaques were removed in January 2019, with a statement from Chancellor Folt citing public safety.\n\nIn November 2019, in response to a lawsuit from the Sons of Confederate Veterans, UNC donated the statue to the group, with a $2.5 million trust for its \"care and preservation\", on the condition that the statue would not be displayed in the same county as any UNC school. However, in February 2020 the settlement was overturned by the judge who originally approved it, who ruled that the SCV lacked standing to bring the lawsuit.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, over 1,000 students and employees of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) enlisted, of whom 287 are known to have lost their lives. University president David Lowry Swain had petitioned the Confederacy to exclude students in their final two years from conscription, and this was granted in 1863, but revoked a year later. Swain was able to keep the university open throughout the war by educating the few students unable to fight—those too young to enlist, exempt because of ill health, or discharged because of war injuries—though the senior class in the spring of 1865 had only one student.\n\nIn 1907, the North Carolina chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) decided that its next major goal was to \"be the erection, on the campus at the State University, of a monument to the students and faculty, who went out from its walls in 1861 to fight and die for the South.\" University President Francis Preston Venable spoke to the 1909 UDC Convention, approving of the plan for a monument, and saying that record of the students who enlisted \"should ever be before the eyes of the present-day students\". The request for a monument was presented to, and approved by, the UNC board of trustees on June 1, 1908.\n\nThe monument was funded by the university, alumni, and the UDC. UNC and the UDC spent until 1913 fundraising the $7,500 that Canadian sculptor John Wilson charged for the statue, which he discounted from his asking price of $10,000. The Daughters originally were slated to give $1,500 of the cost of the statue, though their success at fundraising led the university to ask for them to cover $2,500 by 1911. Most of the rest of the cost was covered by alumni donations. UNC eventually had to give $500 to reach the contracted total of $7,500. The statue was planned to be in place for the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Civil War in 1911. Raising funds to pay for the statue delayed the project by two years.\n\nIn a manner similar to his earlier Daniel A. Bean sculpture, John A. Wilson created a \"silent\" statue by not including a cartridge box on the infantryman's belt so he cannot fire his gun. Like the earlier sculpture, Wilson used a northerner—Harold Langlois of Boston—as his model. This was part of a tradition of \"Silent Sentinels;\" statues created in the North, often mass-produced, depicting soldiers without ammo or with their guns at parade rest. As with these other statues, this memorial was positioned to face north, towards the Union.\n\nA bronze plaque in bas-relief on the front of the memorial's base depicts a woman, representing the state of North Carolina, convincing a young student to fight for the Southern cause as he drops his books, representing students leaving their studies. A smaller bronze plaque on the left side of the base says:\n\nAnother bronze plaque on the right reads:\n\nThe program for the unveiling of the monument started at 3:30 pm, on June 2, 1913. Attendance was reported to be 1,000. Speeches were given by, among others, Mrs. Marshall Williams, president of the local division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy; and Francis Preston Venable, the university's president. The University Band played \"Dixie\" while \"students formally accepted the monument\", and the program concluded with a rendition by a quartet of \"Tenting on the Old Camp Ground\".\n\nThe Governor of North Carolina, Locke Craig, also spoke; regarding the service of students who died in the war:\n\nThe dedication speech which has attracted the most subsequent notice was given by Julian Carr, a prominent industrialist, UNC alumnus and Trustee, former Confederate soldier, and the largest single donor towards the construction of the monument.\n\nThis speech has been described by UNC history professor W. Fitzhugh Brundage as one in which Carr \"unambiguously urged his audience to devote themselves to the maintenance of white supremacy with the same vigor that their Confederate ancestors had defended slavery.\" In it, Carr emphatically praised the student-soldiers and soldiers of the Confederate Army for their wartime valor and patriotism, adding that\n\nAccording to Brundage, Carr's phrase \"the four years immediately succeeding the war\" is a clear reference to the Reconstruction era, when the Ku Klux Klan, working to restore the dominance of traditional white hierarchy in the South, terrorized blacks and white Republicans. Later in the speech; Carr stated:\n\nThe monument appears on an undated, early 20th-century postcard. A picture from 1918, with two soldiers in front, appeared in the 1961 yearbook \"Yackity Yack\".\n\nThe statue was called the \"Soldiers Monument\" in the first student newspaper reference to it in 1913, but was referred to as the \"Confederate Monument\" in the program for its unveiling, and this name was used from the 1920s through the 1940s. The earliest known use of the name \"\"Silent Sam\"\" is from 1954, in the campus newspaper \"The Daily Tar Heel\". A story developed around the statue that \"Sam\" would fire his gun if a virgin walked by, but never did (he was silent) because he never saw any. In 1937 this story was called an \"old local wisecrack\".\n\nThe monument has been a subject of controversy and a site of protest since the 1960s. In March 1965, a discussion about the monument's meaning and history occurred in the letters to the editor of the UNC student newspaper, the \"Daily Tar Heel\". In May 1967, poet John Beecher \"debated\" \"Silent Sam\", reading to the statue from his book of poetry \"To Live and Die in Dixie\". Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in April 1968, the monument was vandalized with orange, green, red, and yellow iridescent paint, including a hammer and sickle. In the early 1970s, the monument was the site of several demonstrations by the Black Student Movement.\n\nIn 1971, the monument was defaced with paint following a basketball victory.\n\nIn 1986, the statue was temporarily removed and shipped to Cincinnati, where it was cleaned and restored by bronze specialists Eleftherios and Mercene Karkadoulias. They repaired cracks, removed green oxidation, and gave the statue a protective wax coating. The refreshed statue was put back in place six months later. The cost was $8,600.\n\nStudents gathered by the statue to speak out after Los Angeles police officers were found not guilty in the 1992 Rodney King trial. In 1997, a Martin Luther King Jr. Day march focusing on issues facing UNC housekeepers ended at the monument.\n\nIn 2003, Gerald Horne, at that time director of the Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, in a letter to the \"Daily Tar Heel\", called the monument \"an eyesore\".\n\nIn January 2011, Adam Domby (then a graduate student in history at UNC, later Assistant Professor of History at the College of Charleston), wrote a letter to the Daily Tar Heel entitled \"Why Silent Sam was built: A historian's perspective\". The letter highlighted Julian Carr's speech at the dedication of the statue, which Domby had uncovered in the university archives in 2009. Carr's speech became a \"galvanizing force\" in activists' efforts to get the statue removed.\n\nSeveral protests in the late 2010s were directed toward the statue, along with calls for its removal.\n\nOn September 1, 2011, a group calling itself the Real Silent Sam Movement held a protest \"to attract attention to the statue's history\". That group, also known as the Real Silent Sam Committee, \"campaigned over the past two years [2011–2013] to replace the current plaque with one that tells what they call \"the true history of the confederate soldier.\"\n\nNorth Carolina NAACP President Reverend William Barber II spoke at a program held on the monument's centenary in 2013.\n\nIn July 2015, the statue was vandalized with the words \"Black Lives Matter\", KKK, and \"murderer\", during a wave of vandalism targeting Confederate monuments. A UNC history professor, Dr. Harry Watson, said that he believed the monument represented an important part of history but that its glorification promoted a false conception of the Civil War. A second protest was held on October 12, University Day, on the steps of Wilson Library.\n\nOfficials said that \"a protective layer would be placed on the monument to ease cleaning efforts for future situations\".\n\nIn late July 2015, the North Carolina General Assembly passed SL 2015–170, the Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015, which states that \"An object of remembrance [defined as \"monument, memorial, or work of art\"] located on public property may not be permanently removed\". It does allow an object to be permanently relocated, provided that it is \"relocated to a site of similar prominence, honor, visibility, availability, and access, ...within the boundaries of the jurisdiction from which it was relocated.\" Approval of the North Carolina Historical Commission is required.\n\nOn the night of August 17–18, 2015, the statue, along with the Chapel Hill Post Office, were defaced with the words \"Who is Sandra Bland?\" On September 9, 2015, the monument was blindfolded with \"a Confederate bandanna\". Seeing how the monument was being defaced, a \"Pro-Confederate Rally\" in support of \"Silent Sam\" was announced for October 25; the protestors were from Alamance County, and had no connection with the university. They were met by three times as many counterdemonstrators, \"most of them students\". One of the students handed out 158 copies of W.E.B. DuBois' seminal 1903 book \"The Souls of Black Folk\" — 158 being, according to the student, the number of years between the foundation of the university and its admitting black students.\n\nOn October 12, 2015, University Day, a group of about two dozen students, calling itself The Real Silent Sam Coalition, interrupted a speech by Chancellor Folt, shouting \"Tear it down, tear it down, or we'll shout you down\". They received applause from some faculty present.\n\nOn January 12, 2016, UNC police arrested a man for \"spray-painting a message on Silent Sam\".\n\nAlready in August 2017, it was reported that Silent Sam \"has been vandalized multiple times in recent years\". \"Silent Sam has been a target for protest and vandalism for decades.\"\n\n\"The push to get UNC to remove the statue...took off in earnest in August 2017\", after the proposed removal of Confederate statues in Charlottesville, Virginia led to the Unite the Right rally on August 11–12, and on August 14, the toppling of the Confederate Soldiers Memorial in nearby Durham. Beginning in August there was \"a year of sit-ins, rallies and protests involving students, faculty and community members\".\n\nOn August 15, 2017, a video taken by a passer-by shows a man beating the statue with a hammer.\n\nOn August 17, 2017, Chapel Hill mayor Pam Hemminger sent a letter to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, requesting that it petition the North Carolina Historical Commission to immediately remove Silent Sam from campus \"in the interest of public safety.\" \"The possibility of a breach of the peace is high, and with it the likelihood that Silent Sam could suffer substantial damage.\"\n\nOn August 20, 2017, protestors singing \"We Shall Overcome\" draped \"Silent Sam\" in black, as had just been proposed for the Charlottesville statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, whose removal, at least for the moment, had recently been blocked (see Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials#Virginia).\n\nOn August 21 Chancellor Folt issued a message urging students not to attend the rally scheduled for the next day, \"considering the potential for a highly charged atmosphere and the very real possibility for confrontation with outside groups.\" The rally was \"being organized by groups not associated with the university... If we had the ability to immediately move the statue we would.\"\n\nThe same day, UNC chancellor Carol Folt, UNC president Margaret Spellings, UNC board-of-governors chairman Lou Bissette, and UNC trustee chairman Haywood Cochrane wrote to Governor Roy Cooper, warning of \"significant safety and security threats\" concerning \"Silent Sam\": \"it is only a matter of time before an attempt is made to pull down \"Silent Sam\" in much the same manner we saw in Durham ... An attempt may occur at any time.\" They also asked the Governor to convene the North Carolina Historical Commission to take up the question of what to do with the statue,\" although \"the panel has little leeway to remove the statue permanently.\" The danger was not just the physical risks of taking such a heavy object off a pedestal, it was the probable confrontations between pro- and anti-Confederate demonstrators from outside the University. Folt stated that if UNC could remove the statue it would, but was prohibited by the 2015 law cited above. Cooper responded to Spellings, saying UNC could remove the statue if there was \"a real risk to public safety,\" but did not himself say that the risk existed. Folt replied that despite the governor's advice, the university did not think it could say it was a \"risk to public safety\" in the sense intended by the 2015 law, which refers to \"a building inspector or similar official\" making that determination, \"where the statue itself poses a physical hazard.\" As put on a separate occasion, \"UNC ... doesn't agree that it's received the green light by anyone with authority to relocate the statue.\" Removal will require legislative action.\n\nFolt received considerable criticism from UNC-CH students and faculty for not taking a stronger position on the removal of \"Silent Sam\".\n\nThe UNC Board of Governors also criticized Folt for her request of the Governor, saing that the request \"was a 'wholly unacceptable' unilateral decision by Spellings and Bissette\". They said the letter to the governor should have been reviewed and approved by the entire board, instead of only the board's committee chairs. They said they would not have given their approval to send the letter to Cooper. ... \"The letter exuded a weakness and hand wringing that does not accurately reflect the Board's opinion about how the potential of campus unrest should be treated\", said the letter, which was dated August 22. According to UNC-CH officials, \"any petition to the North Carolina Historical Commission requesting the removal of the statue would have to come from the UNC System Board of Governors. That body has shown no public interest in doing so at this point.\"\n\nThe UNC Board of Trustees then released a statement supporting Folt, saying: \"Above all, regardless of the circumstance, the chancellor has a responsibility to the people of North Carolina to uphold all state laws. With this new law, it is relatively easy for many individuals to speculate about its meaning or offer possible loopholes as ways to operate around the law. It would be unwise and imprudent for the University to take any action regarding the monument without additional legal clarity, and we would expect no less from our chancellor.\"\n\nOn August 22, 2017, at the beginning of the school year, a \"Rally for Removal of Silent Sam\", announced on a poster describing the day as \"the first day of Silent Sam's last semester\", attracted about 800 people. Thousands signed a change.org petition to remove it. Chanting \"Hey, hey. Ho, ho. This racist statue has got to go\" and \"Tear it down\", protestors marched to the official residence of University President Margaret Spellings, briefly blocking traffic on Franklin Street, Chapel Hill's main street, which adjoins the oldest part of the campus, where Silent Sam was located. The statue was surrounded by police in riot gear.\n\nFormer UNC-CH Chancellor James Moeser, interviewed at the rally, said: \"I used to be of the mind that we should contextualize history...but Charlottesville changed my mind.\" \"Once statues like this become weaponized by the white supremacist[s] and the Nazis, keeping it up is untenable, I think it has to go. And I think it will go.\"\n\nOn September 6, 2017, demonstrators chanted and made noise with drums, pots and pans, birthday party horns, and \"anything they could get their hands on\" in front of South Building, where Chancellor Folt's office is. Their stated intent was \"disrupt[ing] business as usual\", and they unusuccessfully asked Chancellor Folt to listen to their reasons why they felt \"Silent Sam\" should be removed.\n\nOn September 21, the day before the North Carolina Historical Commission was to meet, UNC-CH issued a press release. It stated that the University was not making any proposal on \"Silent Sam\" to the Commission at that time. Given that the North Carolina Historical Commission had not yet made any ruling related to the 2015 law, and that Governor Cooper, through the North Carolina Department of Administration, had filed a petition to relocate three monuments located on the State Capitol grounds, \"We are carefully following these proceedings, which we hope will shed light on what standards the commission will be using to evaluate such matters.\" (The decision, which arrived two days after \"Silent Sam\" was toppled, was negative, as the North Carolina Historical Commission found that the law did not allow them to approve the request.)\n\nOn October 26, 35 professors from the School of Law posted a statement saying: \"To many in our community, the armed soldier expresses the idea that some in our community are not equal. This disparaging and marginalizing symbol has no place at the core of an inclusive learning environment... We also believe that the message it sends undercuts the University's mission \"to teach a diverse community of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students to become the next generation of leaders. Maintaining this monument undercuts the value of equality protected by North Carolina law and the United States Constitution. We note that federal law obliges the University to provide an inclusive learning environment free of racial hostility... If the University remains uncertain of its legal ability to act, we ask it to seek a declaration in court to affirm UNC's right to remove the statue. This path would spare our students and faculty from the distraction, expense and pain of suing their home institution.\" They related the \"Silent Sam\" situation with another controversial issue, \"the Board of Governors' recent ban on representation or counsel by the Center for Civil Rights.\"\n\nIn November, 2017, Maya Little, graduate student in history and leader of \"Silent Sam\" protests during 2017–2018, posted documentation of the University's Police Department having used an undercover officer to gather information on the protestors, which the university confirmed. This discovery led to another rally outside South Building on November 14.\n\nA November 1 statement (posted November 9) from the Department of Communication stated \"We understand 'Silent Sam' to be a symbol of the history and legacies of racial slavery, anti-black racism, and white supremacy that persist in the state of North Carolina, the university, and our country... [W]e have a moral obligation to remove this symbol of violent oppression from our midst, and continue the work of dismantling systemic racism.\" \nThe UNC Department of Geography, in a letter reported on November 9, stated that \"Silent Sam\" \"contradicts values of diversity, social justice and anti-violence that our discipline embraces... The continued presence of the monument is damaging to all of us who share this campus, but disproportionately jeopardizes the wellbeing of students with marginalized identities.\" On November 27, the UNC School of Education posted a statement on its website, saying that the statue is and \"was erected as a symbol of hatred, bigotry, and white supremacy\". ... As educators, we have an obligation to continue the work of dismantling systemic racism.\" \"Faculty, staff, students and graduates from the UNC School of Social Work\", in a letter reported on December 15, added their support, saying \"Whatever else the memorial may symbolize to some, it was erected to glorify White people in the South, and, by extension, to carry on the subjugation of Black people. Its presence continues to legitimize and incite violence, dehumanization, and oppression. Such racist symbolism is antithetical to the ethos of this vibrant, public university.\"\n\nIn late February, 2018, an email was sent anonymously to Chancellor Folt, stating it was from 17 \"senior faculty\", \"all Full Professors and Endowed Chaired [sic] Professors\", who vowed \"to move the statue themselves if the Chancellor has not done so by March 1st at midnight\", saying they did not fear arrest. They claimed to be from the College of Arts and Sciences, the Medical School, the School of Public Health, and the School of Law, and quoted Edmund Burke: \"the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing\". They said they would release the email to the \"Daily Tar Heel\", the campus newspaper, if she did not reply first. On February 25 a University spokesperson confirmed the letter had been received. On the same day the email, accompanied by a press release, was sent to the \"Daily Tar Heel\", which published them. The paper said it had met with a representative from the group, \"who is a senior faculty member at UNC\". In a statement on February 27, \"the group said they received word...that Folt is preparing to ask Gov. Roy Cooper to petition the North Carolina Historical Commission for an urgent ruling to relocate Silent Sam\", and \"as a sign of good faith, understanding that the Chancellor is now seeking the quick removal of Silent Sam, we shall stand down for the present\". Asked if Folt reached out or was planning to reach out to Cooper in response to the letter, Joanne Peters Denny, a UNC spokesperson, said these conversations were not happening: \"We don't make our policy decisions based on threats from unauthenticated, anonymous groups\".\n\nOn April 30, 2018, Maya Little defaced the statue, which she called \"a symbol of UNC's commitment to white supremacy\", with a mixture of red ink (some sources say paint) and her own blood. She described her action as \"provid[ing] context\": \"This statue, Silent Sam, was built on white supremacy. It was built by white supremacists... These statues symbolize the violence toward Black people. Without that blood on the statue, it's incomplete, in my opinion. It's not properly contextualized.\" The act was publicized in advance and news media and the UNC Police were present. She was arrested and charged with defacing a public statue, with a court date of August 20. She was also charged with a UNC Honor Code violation. The statue cleaning began within minutes, although at her trial, \"a campus maintenance supervisor testified it took several days to remove red stains at a cost of about $4,000 in supplies and labor\". Faculty in the History Department issued a statement supporting her. At her trial on October 15, she admitted her guilt, but the judge withheld the verdict (\"continued judgment\"), so she received no sentence, and court fees and restitution were waived. A petition Little posted on change.org asking for the Honor Court charges to be dropped received 6,600 signatures.\n\nIn July, 2018, Silent Sam, covered by a red X and the words \"North Carolina needs a monumental change\", was depicted in Raleigh on two identical billboards, on Blount Street near Hoke Street and on North Raleigh Boulevard near the intersection with Yonkers Road. They were paid for by the Make It Right Project, a project of the Independent Media Institute, which is working to have Silent Sam and nine other Confederate monuments removed. The stated audience the billboards were intended to reach — thus the Raleigh locations — were the members of the North Carolina Historical Commission. At about the same time, the Project printed posters with a picture of Silent Sam, an X over him, and the words \"We need REAL heroes\", and students put them up on the campus.\n\nIn a press release dated August 15, the North Carolina Historical Commission stated that it \"has received requests from private individuals to relocate the 'Silent Sam' monument at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but has not received a petition from the university, the UNC system, or its governing body, the Board of Governors.\"\n\nUNC had begun developing alternate signs and an interactive tour meant to place \"Silent Sam\" in context and tell the \"true\" history of UNC. From July 1, 2017 – June 30, 2018, UNC spent $390,000 on security for the monument. Of that, $3,000 was for cleaning the monument. The $387,000 remainder was spent on law enforcement personnel costs. \"Silent Sam\" was under 24-hour video surveillance via a monitor in the campus Police Department.\n\nOn the night of August 20, 2018, the day before the 2018–19 academic year began, another \"Remove \"Silent Sam\"\" rally was held, beginning with speakers at 7 P.M. The protest had been billed as a rally in support of graduate student Maya Little, whose original court appearance for defacing the monument was scheduled for that day. Protestors marched down and briefly blocked Franklin Street, Chapel Hill's main downtown street. In contrast with the 2017 rally, police stayed in the background, and video of the protest was reported as showing police moving away from the monument shortly before protesters pulled it down.\"\n\nIn a speech at the protest, Little said,\nLarge signs with such inscriptions as \"The whole world is watching\", \"Which side are you on?\", \"For a world without white supremacy\", and a list of victims of racial violence (beginning with \"Unnamed Black woman beaten by Julian Carr\") were held around the monument, blocking it from view while heavy ropes were tied to it. A later report referred to \"torches\" as well. WUNC Managing Editor Dave DeWitt, who was present, called it \"a well-planned and executed effort\".\n\nAt 9:20 p.m., \"Silent Sam\" was felled; the crowd cheered. \"People [were] screaming and jumping in disbelief.\" A newscaster on the scene described the mood as \"jubilation\". Holding signs and chanting \"stand up, fight back\" and \"This is what democracy looks like\", some protesters stamped on the statue or tried to cover it with dirt.\n\nPolice, who cordoned off the area around the pedestal, arrested one person who concealed his or her face in the public protest (prohibited in North Carolina). Some police are reported to have been smiling. Crowds remained around the base, and the Associated Press reported that students were drawn to see it as the news of the toppling spread.\n\nLater that night, campus staff loaded the statue, which did not seem to be seriously damaged, onto a flat-bed dump truck and removed it from the site.\n\nOn August 25 and 30 and on September 8, follow-up demonstrations were held at the site by supporters and critics of the toppling of the statue. The August 30 demonstration was convened as a \"Silent Sam Twilight Service\" by Take Back Alamance County, a group designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. (See Flaggers (movement).) Chancellor Folt asked people not to come to these events for safety reasons. Some of these protests led to arrests for assault, resisting arrest, and inciting a public disturbance. Supporters of Silent Sam were greatly outnumbered by counter-protesters.\n\nThe morning after the topping, UNC issued a statement on Twitter which read:\n\nA later statement from Chancellor Folt, UNC President Margaret Spellings, and other university leaders said, \"Last night's rally was unlike any previous event on our campus. This protest was carried out in a highly organized manner and included a number of people unaffiliated with the University. While we respect that protesters have the right to demonstrate, they do not have the right to damage state property.\"\n\nThe State Bureau of Investigation agreed to help UNC police with their investigation into the toppling. The chair of the UNC board of governors, Harry Smith, said on August 22, 2018, that the board would engage an outside firm to investigate the actions of the university and police at the protest, adding that Chancellor Folt had not herself ordered police to take a hands-off approach.\n\nOn University Day, October 12, 2018, Chancellor Folt issued an apology for the university's connections to slavery, saying: \"I reaffirm our university's commitment to facing squarely and working to right the wrongs of history so they are never again inflicted\".\n\nAs of September 7, 2018, only one person had been charged with participating in the actual toppling of the \"Silent Sam\" statue. At least 25 other people had been arrested on charges of misdemeanor riot, misdemeanor defacing of a public monument, causing damage to property, causing a public disturbance, defacing a public building, concealing one's face, resisting arrest, simple assault, and affray (fighting). At a hearing on September 20, one person's charge was dropped, and that of another person will be dropped following completion of community service.\n\nDuring 2017–2018, the UNC Police Department used an undercover police officer to gain information on the activities of campaigners against Silent Sam. This was discovered on November 2, 2017 when students saw the former \"auto mechanic\" in police uniform. The Police Department has confirmed this and defended what they did as \"intelligence gathering\". The use of an undercover officer was bitterly resented by some Silent Sam protestors, and was brought up repeatedly during later protests.\n\nThe actions or inaction on August 20, 2018, of the UNC Campus Police and the Chapel Hill Police Department, which differed from their actions at the 2017 protest, have been the subject of many comments. As mentioned above, they will be examined by outside investigators. One Chapel Hill officer was put on administrative leave with pay after his tattoo closely resembling that of a far-right group was seen during the Aug. 20 protest. Eight persons, all of whom had been arrested, signed a document alleging police misconduct at the September 8 protest.\n\nA Community Policing Advisory Committee meets monthly to receive feedback concerning the Campus Police. At the August meeting there were 2 attendees, \"who wanted to speak about \"Silent Sam\"\". The September 11 meeting had over 75 participants and was moved to the Chapel Hill Public Library. Campus Police Chief Chris Blue was asked to leave slightly after the meeting began, and he did so. More than 20 people spoke, all of them critical of various police actions: \"The people who are there being violent are the police themselves,\" said an attorney who attended. Several speakers alleged that the police were more lenient with demonstrators from outside the university than they were with student participants.\n\nAt an earlier September 5 meeting on the campus, \"residents\" asked the town to reconsider its relationship with the Greensboro Police Department, whose Special Operations Division was called in to assist with crowd control during the August 30 protest.\n\nOn September 20, 2018, about 75 demonstrators in front of South Building protested \"police brutality\" and what they called \"targeting, harassing, and spying on anti-racist protesters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA student documentary about the statue, \"Silence Sam\", was shown on November 30, 2018, at Duke University, under the sponsorship of Duke's Center for Documentary Studies.\n\nFrom August 2018, \"Silent Sam\" was being kept in an undisclosed location because of safety concerns. In September 2019, a student reporter found what appeared to be the statue and pedestal under tarpaulins in a storage yard on the UNC campus. The university declined to confirm or deny the report.\n\nThe University of North Carolina system president, Margaret Spellings, summarised the situation: \"The people who are paying the bills in the state of North Carolina, who underwrite in very significant ways the cost of operating that and every other institution in this system, by all polling and all accounts seem to support the restoration of the statue. Conversely, the community of Chapel Hill seems to feel very strongly that it should not be restored to its original place.\"\n\nThom Goolsby, Board of Governors member and former state senator, has said that the law is \"perfectly clear\": \"\"Silent Sam\" needs to go back up on that same spot. Anything short of that is giving into mob rule and anarchy, and I won't agree with it.\"\n\nFormer Chancellor James Moeser said it was \"inconceivable\" that the statue go back on the pedestal, and proposed the creation of a civil rights museum on campus, perhaps in the Playmakers Theatre building, as a place where the statue could be displayed.\n\nOn August 31, Chancellor Folt issued a statement saying that Silent Sam's original location was \"a cause for division and a threat to public safety,\" and that, with the approval of the university system's Board of Governors, she was seeking input on a \"safe, legal and alternative\" location for the statue elsewhere on campus. On November 9, a further statement from Chancellor Folt said that a decision had not yet been made, and the Board of Governors had granted a \"short extension\" to this deadline.\n\nOn September 4, 2018, a letter from 450 UNC faculty members, supporting Folt's preference for relocating the statue, was sent to the Board of Governors, Board of Trustees, and key administrators. \"The civic, economic, emotional, and cultural well-being of our community, as well as the university's educational mission, will suffer continued damage by the presence of the monument on McCorkle Place.\" On the same day, 8 alumni co-chairs of a fundraising committee, most former members of the Trustees or the Board of Visitors, sent a letter to the Board of Trustees: This is an \"increasingly dangerous situation impacting our students and faculty and threatening to tarnish the reputation of our nation’s first public university, as well as the State of North Carolina... Now that \"Silent Sam\" is down, we are united in agreeing that it should not return to its former location.\" The Chapel Hill-Carrboro Chamber of Commerce and the Chapel Hill Downtown Partnership also called for the permanent relocation of \"Silent Sam\", saying the continued protests around the monument are hurting business and threatening the safety of the town.\n\nThe Administrative Board of the Library stated publicly that it does not want the statue in any university library, and recommended that it go to a location such as Raleigh's North Carolina Museum of History.\n\nOn August 28, 41 department chairs in the College of Arts and Sciences sent a letter to Chancellor Folt opposing the return of Silent Sam to its pedestal or any prominent location on campus.\n\nAt the end of August, 37 Chapel Hill faith leaders wrote an open letter saying that \"returning Silent Sam to its previous location furthers the goal of those who originally put it there: venerating white supremacy, and denigrating people of color.\"\n\nMayor of Chapel Hill Pam Hemminger had written the university on August 17, 2017, requesting that \"Silent Sam\" be moved (see above). On September 21, 2018, Mayor Hemminger and the entire town council wrote Folt and other UNC leaders:\n\nThe North Carolina Attorney General, Josh Stein, also made a statement supporting the removal or relocation of \"statues that...promote white supremacy\".\n\nA September 7, 2018, statement in the \"Washington Post\" from 59 black UNC-CH faculty members asked that the university \"permanently remove the Confederate statue and its pedestal from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill... A symbol of racism, violence, and white supremacy has no place on our 21st century campus often called the 'University of the People'.\" 417 other UNC-CH faculty signed a letter of support.\n\nOn October 12, the Faculty Council, UNC's main faculty body, passed a resolution requesting the permanent removal of the statue and its base. \"Returning the statue to the UNC-Chapel Hill campus would reaffirm the values of white supremacy that motivated its original installation,\" the resolution said. \"Moreover, to do so would undermine the physical security of all members of our community.\"\n\nIn November 2019 the University of North Carolina Board of Governors announced that ownership of the statue was being transferred to the North Carolina Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), on the condition that it not be displayed in any county in which the University has a campus. The university also agreed to fund an independent charitable trust — with $2.5 million in money not from the state — to be used for care and preservation of the statue.\n\nThis settlement offer came on November 27, 2019, two minutes after the Sons of Confederate Veterans sued the UNC system and its Board of Governors. The settlement was ordered five minutes after the response was filed. A letter distributed to the SCV members, briefing them on the settlement, was published via Dropbox by attorney T. Greg. Doucette. It was removed by Dropbox due to a complaint of violation of the DMCA, but subsequently republished by news sources.\n\nThe agreement was criticised by university staff, alumni and students, who accused the university of a back-room deal with white supremacists. There had been no public meeting to discuss the settlement, or any public announcement of the lawsuit or potential deal until it was settled.\n\nOn February 12, 2020, after the statue and money had been handed over to the SCV, Orange County Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour, who had originally approved the settlement, overturned it, noting that the deal had been agreed before the lawsuit existed, and ruling that the Sons of Confederate Veterans \"lacked standing\" for the suit.\n\nThe university subsequently sought help from the judge to recover the statue and money from the SCV.\n\nBaddour ruled April 8 that $2.42 million from the trust fund go back to the UNC system in 10 days.

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is poised to set a national example of allowing lawful protest while protecting free speech. But campus administrators and law enforcers so far have come up short, some experts say.\"\n\nIn response to a August 21 request from WRAL-TV, on September 12 the UNC-CH administration released 800 pages of emails and texts relevant to the toppling.\n\nArchival material on Julian Carr is in Special Collections, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library.

The land upon which the campus is situated accommodates several buildings, dating from the early 1900s, designated as provincial heritage buildings, including a wooden water tower. As the buildings have heritage status, this legally forbids any alteration of their exterior, with the exception of repair, a prohibition which does not extend to their interior. Thus these buildings have been transformed into new classrooms, a bookstore, common areas and cafeteria. The water tower has been braced to protect it from collapse, and repainted in its original colour, Canadian Pacific Railway red, the only colour legally allowed due to its heritage status. In September 2016, the new Heritage Centre building was officially opened.\n\nIn 2011, St. Mary's initiated a site development planning process to identify guiding principles, development options and concept plans for its 35-acre campus.\n\nSt. Mary's library contains over 30,000 titles and has 51 workstations accessible by students. The St. Mary's library is also home to The St. John's Bible. It is a fully illuminated bible that is handwritten by world renowned calligrapher Donald Jackson (calligrapher) who is the scribe to the Queen of England. It is arguably the first time a cathedral, monastery or religious organization has commissioned something to this scale in over 500 years.\n\nThe student body of St. Mary's is represented to faculty and administration by the Student Legislative Council (SLC). St. Mary's University supports student-run clubs and activities. Current clubs include a book club, board games club, The Ed society, The Historical Society, Literary Guild, Outdoors club, Science Club, Psychology Association, Student 4 Social Justice, D&D club, and ethics club. As of recently, the St. Mary's community had produced and premiered the play The Ghost Wilderness written by Dr. Gerry Turcotte. The play was well received by the university, city and theater communities.\n\nSt. Mary’s University was a founding member of the Alberta Colleges Athletic League. The league is composed of small colleges and has affiliated members in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The institution was accepted into the Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference (ACAC) in May 2010. Lightning basketball teams began competing at this level in Fall 2012. In fall 2014, the Lightning introduced their Cross Country program, making it St. Mary’s University’s third team competing in the ACAC.\n\n"}

Known as a promoter of missionary work, he also took part in theological controversy.\n\nFuller was born in Wicken, Cambridgeshire, and settled at Kettering, Northamptonshire. During his life, Fuller pastored two congregations – Soham (1775–1782) and Kettering (1782–1815), which is now the Fuller Baptist Church, He died on 7 May 1815 at Kettering.\n\nFuller is best known in connection with the foundation of the Baptist Missionary Society, to which he for the most part devoted his energies. His work in promoting the missionary enterprises of the Baptist church began about 1784. A sermon published by him then, \"The Nature and Importance of Walking by Faith\", with an appendix \"A Few Persuasives to a General Union in Prayer for the Revival of Religion\", indirectly stimulated the movement. The Baptist Missionary Society (initially \"Particular Baptist Society for Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen\") was formed at Kettering in 1792. William Carey, impressed by Fuller's work \"The Gospel Worthy of all Acceptation\", became the first missionary. Fuller took on the work at home.\n\nFuller, a Particular Baptist, was a controversialist in defence of the governmental theory of the atonement against hyper-Calvinism on the one hand and Socinianism and Sandemanianism on the other. Abraham Booth accused him of giving up true Calvinism. Fuller debated theology with the General Baptist Dan Taylor, but they remained on good terms.\n\nAccording to \"Christianity Today\", \"'Tall, stout and muscular, a famous wrestler in his youth,' this self-taught farmer’s son became a champion for Christ, 'the most creatively useful theologian' of the Particular Baptists. His book \"The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation\", 1785, restated Calvinist theology for Baptists influenced by the Evangelical Revival. His Doctorate of Divinity was bestowed by Brown University, Rhode Island.\"\n\nFuller wrote:\n\n\nFuller also wrote pamphlets, sermons, and essays. He contributed to Charles Edward de Coetlogon's \"Theological Miscellany\", the \"Evangelical Magazine\", the \"Missionary Magazine\", the \"Quarterly Magazine\", the \"Protestant Dissenters' Magazine\", and the \"Biblical Magazine\". John Ryland, in his \"Life\" of Fuller, enumerated 167 articles that Fuller had contributed. Editions of his \"Complete Works\" appeared in 1838, 1840, 1845, 1852, and 1853. Joseph Belcher edited an edition in three volumes for the Baptist Publication Society of Philadelphia, and his major publications were issued with a memoir by his son in Bohn's Standard Library, 1852.\n\nFuller kept shorthand notes of his earlier sermons and these remained undeciphered until 2019.\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n\nThe eight volume \"The Works of Andrew Fuller\" includes volumes from the 1820, 1824, and 1825 editions.\n"}

It is named after American astronomer Edward Singleton Holden. It is part of the Uzboi-Landon-Morava (ULM) system.\n\nLike Gusev, it is notable for an outlet channel, Uzboi Vallis, that runs into it, and for many features that seem to have been created by flowing water. It's believed that Holden Crater was formed by an impact during the Noachian or Hesperian periods. \n\nThe crater's rim is cut with gullies, and at the end of some gullies are fan-shaped deposits of material transported by water. The crater is of great interest to scientists because it has some of the best-exposed lake deposits. One of the layers has been found by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to contain clays. \n\nClays only form in the presence of water. There are two unit of sediments in the crater. The lower unit formed in a large lake. It is believed the lake waters originated from the crater walls/or groundwater. Water from the crater walls may have come from precipitation when the Martian climate was different. The upper unit formed when water that was ponded to the south in Uzboi Vallis broke through Holden's rim. It is believed that great amount of water went through the rim; one flow was caused by a body of water larger than Earth's Lake Huron. Some of the evidence for such a large flow of water is the presence of boulders tens of meters in size sticking above the surface. To transport such huge rocks takes a great deal of water.\n\nHolden is an old crater, containing numerous smaller craters, many of which are filled with sediment. The crater's central mountain is also obscured by sediment.\nHolden Crater was a proposed landing site for NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, until Gale Crater was deemed a better landing site. Just to the north east of Holden Crater is Eberswalde Crater which contains a large delta. The lower beds of Holden are thought by some to maybe similar to materials in Eberswalde Crater. However, Holden Crater is now considered a potential landing site for the \"Mars 2020\" rover. In the second Mars 2020 Landing Site Workshop it survived the cut and was named to be among the top 8 sites still in the running for the landing.\n\nStudies of the whole region around Holden Crater have resulted in an understanding of a complex sequence of events that shaped the crater, which included two different lakes. A large series of rivers called the Uzboi-Ladon-Morava (ULM) system drained water from the Argyre Basin, site of a large lake. When an impact occurred and produced Holden Crater, the system was blocked by a crater rim almost a kilometer in height. Eventually water from drainage from the walls, with possibly a contribution from groundwater, collected to make the first lake. This lake was deep and long lasting. The lowest level of sedimentary rocks was deposited in this lake. Much water was inbounded in Uzboi Vallis because the rim of Holden Crater blocked the flow. Some of the backed up water came from Nirgal Vallis which had a discharge of 4800 cubic meters/second. At a certain point the stored water broke through the rim of Holden and created a second, shorter lived lake 200–250 m deep. Water with a depth of at least 50 m entered Holden at a rate that 5-10 times the discharge of the Mississippi River. Terraces and the presence of large rocks (tens of meters across) support these high discharge rates.\n\nSeveral sites in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle were proposed as areas to send NASA's major Mars rover, the Mars Science Laboratory. Holden Crater made the cut to be among the top four, although Gale Crater was chosen as the final landing site. Holden Crater is believed to have once been a lake.\n\nThe aim of the Mars Science Laboratory is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples from sites identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12 mile wide, smooth, flat circle is needed. Geologists hope to examine places where water once ponded, and want to examine sediment layers.\n\nAlthough the \"Curiosity\" landed in Gale Crater, Holden was one of the seven finalists for the MSL landing site: which also included Eberswalde Crater, Mawrth Vallis, Miyamoto Crater, Nili Fossae Trough, and the Southern Meridiani\n\n\n"}

His \"Erdbeschreibung\" (\"Earth description\") was the first geographical work of any scientific merit. He also did significant work on behalf of education.\n\nHe was born at Stadthagen in Schaumburg-Lippe, on the 27 September 1724. In his youth, he was harshly treated by his father, but a clergyman of the name of Hauber, pleased with his talents, undertook to give him free instruction, and afterwards enabled him to continue his studies at Halle. There, by application and good conduct, he acquired numerous friends, and in 1748 he was appointed tutor in the family of the count zu Lynar, who was then going as ambassador to St Petersburg.\n\nOn the way to St. Petersburg, Büsching noticed the defective state of geographical science, and he resolved to devote his life to its improvement. Leaving the count's family at the first opportunity, he went to reside at Copenhagen, and devoted himself entirely to this new pursuit. In 1752 he published his brief \"Description of the Counties of Schleswig and Holstein\" as a specimen of what he hoped to do.\n\nIn 1754 he moved to Göttingen. While at Göttingen, he married the poet Christiana Dilthey. Here a work in which he dissented from some of the Lutheran tenets lost him the appointment in 1757 to the theological chair for which he had become a candidate, but he was appointed professor of philosophy.\n\nIn 1761 he accepted an invitation to minister to a Protestant German congregation at St Petersburg. There he organized a German-language secondary school which, under him, soon became one of the most flourishing in the north of Europe. A disagreement with Marshal Münich led him, in spite of the empress's offers of high advancement, to return to central Europe in 1765.\n\nBack in Germany, he first went to live at Altona, but next year he was called to superintend the famous Greyfriars Gymnasium (), which had been formed at Berlin by Frederick the Great. Here he superintended the progress of every pupil, and inspected the minutest details connected with the prosperity of the institution, besides giving lectures on the history of the arts and sciences.\nHis writing and example given a new impulse to education throughout Prussia, and the government was so sensible of the value of his services that they allowed his extensive correspondence to pass free of postage.\n\nHe died in Berlin of dropsy, on 28 May 1793.\n\nBüsching's works on geography, history, education and religion, enumerated by Meusel in his \"Lexicon of German Authors\", amount to more than a hundred. His reputation chiefly rests on his geographical works, for although he did not possess the genius of D'Anville, he may be regarded as the creator of statistical geography.\n\nHis magnum opus is the \"Erdebeschreibung\", in seven parts, of which the first four, covering Europe, were published in 1754–1761, and were translated into several languages (e.g. into English with a preface by Murdoch, in six volumes, London, 1762). In 1768 the fifth part was published, being the first volume upon Asia, containing Asiatic Turkey and Arabia. It displays an immense extent of research, and is generally considered as his masterpiece.\n\nBüsching was also the editor of a valuable collection entitled \"Magazin für die neue Historie und Geographie\" (23 vols. 4to, 1767–1793), and also of \"Wochentliche Nachrichten von neuen Landkarten\" (Berlin, 1773–1787).\n\nHis works on education enjoyed great repute. In biography he wrote a number of articles for the \"Magazin\", and a valuable collection of \"Beiträge zur Lebensgeschichte merkwürdiger Personen\" (6 vols., 1783–1789), including an elaborate life of Frederick the Great.\nHis theological writings were less successful.\n\nWhen he died, Matthias Christian Sprengel and several other geographers continued his work.\n\nHis son Johann Gustav Gottlieb Büsching was a noted antiquarian.\n"}

{"id": "1892124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892124", "title": "Lavender Menace", "text": "Lavender Menace\n\nThe Lavender Menace or revolution was an informal group of lesbian radical feminists formed to protest the exclusion of lesbians and lesbian issues from the feminist movement at the Second Congress to Unite Women in New York City on May 1, 1970. Members included Karla Jay, Martha Shelley, Rita Mae Brown, Lois Hart, Barbara Love, Ellen Shumsky, Artemis March, Cynthia Funk, Linda Rhodes, Arlene Kushner, Ellen Broidy, and Michela Griffo, and were mostly members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and the National Organization for Women (NOW).\n\nThe story of the origin of the phrase \"Lavender Menace\" is that it was first used in 1969 by Betty Friedan, president of NOW, to describe the threat that she believed associations with lesbianism posed to NOW and the emerging women's movement. Friedan, and some other heterosexual feminists, worried that the association would hamstring feminists' ability to achieve serious political change, and that stereotypes of \"mannish\" and \"man-hating\" lesbians would provide an easy way to dismiss the movement. Under her direction, NOW attempted to distance itself from lesbian causes – including omitting the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis from the list of sponsors of the First Congress to Unite Women in November 1969. Friedan's remarks and the decision to drop DOB from the sponsor list led lesbian feminist Rita Mae Brown to angrily resign her administrative job at NOW in February 1970 (Jay 137-138, Brownmiller 82). On March 15, 1970, straight radical feminist Susan Brownmiller quoted Friedan's remarks about the \"lavender menace\" and dismissed her worries as \"A lavender \"herring\", perhaps, but no clear and present danger\" in a \"New York Times Magazine\" article. While the term \"Lavender Menace\" originated as a negative term for lesbianism, it was later reclaimed as a positive term by lesbian feminists.\n\nBrownmiller later said that when she wrote the article, she had intended to use a humorous quip to distance herself from Friedan's homophobia (Jay 140, Brownmiller 82), but some lesbian feminists (especially Michela Griffo) took her remarks as \"a scathing put-down\" (Brownmiller 82) and \"evidence of Susan's homophobia or closet homosexuality--that is, that she was trying to distance herself from lesbians by insulting us\" (Jay 140)—because they felt that the quip dismissed lesbians as an insignificant part of the movement, or lesbian issues as unnecessary distractions from the important issues.\n\nRita Mae Brown suggested to her consciousness-raising group that lesbian radical feminists organize an action in response to Brownmiller's comments, and the public airing of Friedan's complaints. The group decided to target the Second Congress to Unite Women in New York City on May 1, 1970, which they noticed featured not a single open lesbian on the program (Jay 140). They planned a zap for the opening session of the Congress, which would use humor and nonviolent confrontation to raise awareness of lesbians and lesbian issues as vital parts to the emerging women's movement. They prepared a ten-paragraph manifesto entitled \"The Woman-Identified Woman\" and made T-shirts, dyed lavender and silkscreened with the words \"Lavender Menace\" for the entire group (Jay 140-142). They also created rose colored signs with slogans like \"Women's Liberation \"IS\" A Lesbian Plot\" and \"You're Going To Love The Lavender Menace\" written on them, which were then placed throughout the auditorium.\n\nKarla Jay, one of the organizers and participants in the zap, describes what happened:\n\nAfter the initial stunt, the \"Menaces\" passed out mimeographed copies of \"The Woman-Identified Woman\" and took the stage, where they explained how angry they were about the exclusion of lesbians from the conference and the women's movement as a whole. A few members of the planning committee tried to take back the stage and return to the original program, but gave up in the face of the resolute Menaces and the audience, who used applause and boos to show their support. The group and the audience then used the microphone for a spontaneous speak-out on lesbianism in the feminist movement, and several of the participants in the \"zap\" were invited to run workshops the next day on lesbian rights and homophobia (Jay 144). Straight and gay women from the congress joined an all-women's dance (a frequent organizing and social tool used by Gay Liberation Front men and women) (Brownmiller 98).\n\nThe \"Lavender Menace\" zap, and the publication of \"The Woman-Identified Woman,\" are widely remembered as a turning-point in the second-wave feminist movement, and as a founding moment for lesbian feminism. After the zap, many of the organizers continued to meet, and decided to create a lasting organization to continue their activism, which they eventually decided to call the \"Radicalesbians.\" At the next national conference of NOW, in September 1971, the delegates adopted a resolution recognizing lesbianism and lesbian rights as \"a legitimate concern for feminism\".\n\nIn 1999, Susan Brownmiller described the impact by writing that \"Lesbians would be silent no longer in the women's movement\" (98). Karla Jay described it in her memoirs as \"the single most important action organized by lesbians who wanted the women's movement to acknowledge our presence and needs,\" and said that it \"completely reshaped the relationship of lesbians to feminism for years to come\" (137). \"We felt as well,\" Jay wrote, \"that the zap was only the first of many actions to come and that lesbian liberation was suddenly and unstoppably on the rise\" (145).\n\n\n\n"}

At length the mountain fell to the enemy, while he escaped and, according to legend, was snatched up by the gods; in fact he died at Rhodes.\n\nAristomenes was a member of the Aepytid family, the son of Nicomedes (or, according to another version, of Pyrrhus) and Nicoteleia, and took a prominent part in stirring up the revolt against Sparta and securing the co-operation of Argos and Arcadia. He showed such heroism in the first encounter, at Derae, that the crown was offered to him, but he would accept only the title of commander-in-chief. His daring is illustrated by the story that he came by night to the temple of Athene \"of the Brazen House\" at Sparta, and there set up his shield with the inscription \"Dedicated to the goddess by Aristomenes from the Spartans.\"\n\nHis prowess contributed largely to the Messenian victory over the Spartan and Corinthian forces at \"The Boar's Barrow\" in the plain of Stenyclarus, but in the following year the treachery of the Arcadian king Aristocrates caused the Messenians to suffer a crushing defeat at \"The Great Trench.\" Aristomenes and the survivors retired to the mountain stronghold of Eira, where they defied the Spartans for eleven years. On one of his raids he and fifty of his companions were captured and thrown into the Caeadas, the chasm on Mount Taygetus into which criminals were cast. Aristomenes alone was saved, and soon reappeared at Eira: legend told how he was upheld in his fall by an eagle and escaped by grasping the tail of a fox, which led him to the hole by which it had entered.\n\nOn another occasion he was captured during a truce by some Cretan auxiliaries of the Spartans, and was released only by the devotion of a Messenian girl who afterwards became his daughter-in-law. At length Eira was betrayed to the Spartans (668 BC according to Pausanias), and after a heroic resistance Aristomenes and his followers had to evacuate Messenia and seek a temporary refuge with their Arcadian allies. A desperate plan to seize Sparta itself was foiled by Aristocrates, who paid with his life for his treachery. Aristomenes retired to Ialysus on Rhodes, where Damagetus, his son-in-law, was king, and died there while planning a journey to Sardis and Ecbatana to seek aid from the Lydian and Median sovereigns.\n\nAnother tradition represents him as captured and slain by the Spartans during the war. Though there seems to be no conclusive reason for doubting the existence of Aristomenes, his history, as related by Pausanias, following mainly the Messeniaca of the Cretan epic poet Rhianus (about 230 BC), is evidently largely interwoven with fictions. These probably arose after the foundation of Messene in 369 BC. Aristomenes's statue was set up in the stadium there: his bones were fetched from Rhodes and placed in a tomb surmounted by a column, and more than five centuries later heroic honours were still paid to him, and his exploits were a popular subject of song.\n\nAccording to explorer Richard Francis Burton, one story about Aristomenes, in which he had been thrown into a pit and had to escapebeing set free by Archidameiais the principal inspiration for one of the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor in the Arabian Nights.\n\nAristomenes is the hero of \"Messene Redeemed\" (1940), a verse drama by F. L. Lucas, based on Pausanias, about Messenian history. \n"}

After the death of Alexander in 76 BCE, his widow succeeded to the rule of Judea and installed her elder son Hyrcanus II as High Priest in 73 BCE. When Salome died in 67 BCE, Hyrcanus succeeded to the kingship as well.\n\nAristobulus shared his late father's views on religion and politics. He entertained designs upon the throne, even during the life of his mother. He courted the nobles and military party by constituting himself the patron of the Sadducees and bringing their cause before the queen. The many fortresses which the queen placed at the disposal of the Sadducees, ostensibly for their defense against the Pharisees, constituted in reality one of the preparatory moves of Aristobulus for the usurpation of the government. The queen sought to direct his military zeal outside Judea, and sent him (70-69) against Ptolemy Mennaeus; but when the undertaking failed, Aristobulus resumed his political intrigues. He left Jerusalem secretly and betook himself to his friends, who controlled the largest number of fortified places, with the intention of making war against his aged mother. But the queen died at the critical moment, and he immediately turned his weapons against his brother Hyrcanus, the legitimate heir to the throne.\n\nHyrcanus seemed to be sympathetic to the Sadducees just like his father Alexander Jannaeus. Aristobulus rebelled against his elder brother. Because of this conflict, the Pharisees seemed to be in a vulnerable position at this time.\n\nHyrcanus advanced against Aristobulus at the head of his mercenaries and his followers. The brothers met in battle near Jericho and many of Hyrcanus' soldiers went over to Aristobulus, and thereby gave the latter the victory.\n\nHyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of Jerusalem; but the capture of the Temple by Aristobulus compelled Hyrcanus to surrender. A peace was then concluded, according to the terms of which Hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest, but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office.\n\nThis agreement however did not last, as Antipater the Idumaean convinced Hyrcanus that Aristobulus was planning his death and to take refuge with Aretas III, King of the Nabataeans. The Nabataeans advanced toward Jerusalem with an army of 50,000 and besieged the city for several months.\n\nDuring this civil war, the Roman general Pompey defeated the Kingdoms of Pontus and the Seleucids. He sent his deputy Marcus Aemilius Scaurus to take possession of Seleucid Syria.\n\nAs the Hasmoneans were allies of the Romans, both brothers appealed to Scaurus, each endeavoring by gifts and promises to win him over to his side. Scaurus, moved by a gift of 400 talents, decided in favor of Aristobulus and ordered Aretas to withdraw his army. During his retreat, the Nabateans suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Aristobulus.\n\nWhen Pompey arrived in Syria in 63 BCE, both brothers and a third party that desired the removal of the entire dynasty, sent their delegates to Pompey, who however delayed the decision. He favoured Hyrcanus II over Aristobulus II, deeming the elder, weaker brother a more reliable ally of the Roman Empire.\n\nPompey defeated the Jewish armies in multiple battles, and took the fortresses of Judea. Aristobulus and his sons Alexander and Antigonus were captured in 63 BCE. Aristobulos, suspicious of Pompey, entrenched himself in the fortress of Alexandrium, but when the Romans defeated his army again, he surrendered and undertook to deliver Jerusalem over to them. However, since many of his followers were unwilling to open the gates, the Romans besieged and captured the city by force, badly damaging city and temple. Hyrcanus was restored as High Priest, but deprived of political authority.\n\nAristobulus II escaped in 57 BCE, instigating rebellion against Rome in Judea, until he was finally holed up by Aulus Gabinius, consul of the Roman province of Syria, in Machaerus. Marc Antony, commander of the cavalry under Gabinius, led several men to scale Aristobulus' fortifications and subdue his forces.\n\nTaken prisoner, Aristobulus was released by Julius Caesar in 49 BCE in order to turn Judea against Pompey. He was on his way to Judaea with his son Alexander, when \"he was taken off by poison given him by those of Pompey's party\". His son Alexander was beheaded by the Roman commander Scipio at Antioch.\n\nHis son Antigonus led a rebellion against Rome, with help from the Parthians, and became king and high priest in 40 BCE, but was defeated and killed by the Romans in 37 BCE.\n\n"}

{"id": "1892156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892156", "title": "Aretaeus of Cappadocia", "text": "Aretaeus of Cappadocia\n\nAretaeus () is one of the most celebrated of the ancient Greek physicians, of whose life, however, few particulars are known. He presumably was a native or at least a citizen of Cappadocia, a Roman province in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey), and most likely lived after the first century (possible floruit 130–140 CE). He is generally styled \"the Cappadocian\" ().\n\nAretaeus wrote in Ionic Greek a general treatise on diseases, which is still extant. The valuable book displays great accuracy in the detail of symptoms, and in seizing the diagnostic character of diseases. In his practice he followed for the most part the method of Hippocrates, but he paid less attention to what have been styled \"the natural actions\" of the system; and, contrary to the practice of the \"Father of Medicine\", he did not hesitate to attempt to counteract them, when they appeared to him to be injurious.\n\nAretaeus offered clinical descriptions of a number of diseases among which he gave classic accounts of asthma, epilepsy, pneumonia, tetanus, uterus cancer and different kinds of insanity. He differentiated nervous diseases and mental disorders and described hysteria, headaches, mania and melancholia. He wrote the first known description of Coeliac disease, naming it disease of the abdomen, \"koliakos\".\n\nThe account which Aretaeus gives of his treatment of various diseases indicates a simple and sagacious system, and one of more energy than that of the professed Methodici. Thus he freely administered active purgatives; he did not object to narcotics; he was much less averse to bleeding; and upon the whole his \"Materia Medica\" was both ample and efficient.\n\nIt may be asserted generally that there are few of the ancient physicians, since the time of Hippocrates, who appear to have been less biased by attachment to any peculiar set of opinions, and whose account of the phenomena and treatment of disease has better stood the test of subsequent experience. Aretaeus is placed by some writers among the Pneumatici because he maintained the doctrines which are peculiar to this sect; other systematic writers, however, think that he is better entitled to be placed with the Eclectics.\n\nAretaeus' work consists of eight books, two \"De causis et signis acutorum morborum\", two \"De causis et signis diuturnorum morborum\", two \"De curatione acutorum morborum\", and two \"De curatione diuturnorum morborum\". They are in a tolerably complete state of preservation, though a few chapters are lost.\n\nThe work was first published in a Latin translation by Junius Paulus Crassus (Giunio Paolo Grassi), Venice 1552, together with Rufus Ephesius. The first Greek edition is that by Jacobus Goupylus, Paris, 1554, which is more complete than the Latin version of Crassus. In 1723 a major edition in folio was published at the Clarendon press at Oxford, edited by John Wigan, containing an improved text, a new Latin version, learned dissertations and notes, and a copious index by Michel Maittaire. In 1731, Boerhaave brought out a new edition, of which the text and Latin version had been printed before the appearance of Wigan's; this edition contains annotations by Pierre Petit and Daniel Wilhelm Triller. The edition by C. G. Kühn, Leipzig 1828, included Wigan's text, Latin version, dissertations, etc., together with Petit's commentary, Triller's emendations, and Maittaire's index. An edition by F. Z. Ermerins was published in Utrecht in 1847.\n\nA more recent standard edition is by Karl Hude (1860–1936) in the \"Corpus medicorum graecorum\" (2nd ed., Berlin, Akademie-Verlag, 1958, online). The four books \"De causis et signis\" have now been issued in an annotated bilingual edition in Greek and French (Arétée de Cappadoce, \"Des causes et des signes des maladies aiguës et chroniques\", trans. R.T.H. Laennec, ed. and comm. Mirko D. Grmek, pref. by Danielle Gourevitch, Geneva, 2000).\n\nThe medical opinions of Aretaeus have been discussed by such scholars as Johann Albert Fabricius, Albrecht von Haller, and Kurt Sprengel. Aretaeus has been treated more recently in a couple of short monographs:\nFor Aretaeus' influence on Giambattista Morgagni, the father of anatomical pathology, see:\n\n\n"}

Attempts to prosecute Perez led to riots and disorder. He eventually fled Spain after being liberated from prison by his supporters, and spent most of his remaining years in France.\n\nAntonio Perez was born in Madrid in 1534. In 1542 he was legalized as son of Gonzalo Pérez, Secretary of the Council of State of king Charles I of Spain (Holy Roman Emperor Charles V). Most probably Antonio was indeed the son of Gonzalo Pérez but conceived while Gonzalo was clergy. Even though Antonio was born in Madrid his attachment was to Aragon where his father was from and where his family was most influential. His followers and supporters were all from Aragon and later in life he would flee to Aragon to find support for himself and protection from the king's persecution.\n\nAntonio Pérez was raised in Val de Concha, Guadalajara, in the lands of Ruy Gomez de Silva, Prince of Eboli and leader of one of the political factions of the time, of which Gonzalo Pérez was part. (The other faction was that of the Duke of Alba.) Antonio later attended the most prestigious universities such as Alcalá de Henares, Salamanca, Leuven, Venice and Padua. His father introduced and trained him in matters of State.\n\nIn 1543 Gonzalo Pérez was appointed secretary of Prince (later king) Philip. In 1556 Charles abdicated his Spanish kingdoms to his son who became king Philip of the several Spanish kingdoms (Castile, Aragon, etc.) and Gonzalo Pérez continued as secretary of the new king. Gonzalo Pérez died in 1566 and his son Antonio was made Secretary of State of Castile a year later.\n\nDuring the first ten years as secretary Gonzalo Pérez had great influence over king Philip who valued his advice. With the death of the Prince of Eboli in 1573 Antonio Pérez became the leader of that faction in accord with the widow, Ana de Mendoza, the one-eyed Princess of Éboli.\n\nIn 1567 Antonio Pérez married Juana de Coello with whom he had several sons.\n\nPérez Martín is most remembered for his role in the murder of Juan de Escobedo, secretary of Don Juan of Austria.\n\nKing Philip was suspicious of the designs of his half brother Don Juan of Austria and Antonio Pérez exploited this suspicion to his own benefit. By advice of Antonio Pérez, in 1575, the king imposed Juan de Escobedo, whom Antonio Pérez considered trustworthy, as secretary of Don Juan of Austria. The design was that Escobedo would spy for Antonio Pérez but it turned out that, unexpectedly, Escobedo became faithful to Don Juan.\n\nAntonio Pérez then began to make king Philip suspicious of Escobedo. Pérez, as secretary for the affairs of the Low Countries, was in a position to intercept and turn to his own advantage many innocent documents. He doctored reports and wrote derisive comments on the margins of letters destined for the king. He repeatedly insinuated to the king that Don Juan was plotting against him and Escobedo (code named \"Verdinegro\" - \"green-black\") was encouraging him in his plotting. He convinced the king that Escobedo must be killed without judicial process for \"reasons of State\". The king gave his assent but had no other participation in the murder.\n\nIn early 1577 Don Juan was in the low Countries and Escobedo, his secretary, was visiting Madrid having been sent there by Don Juan. After three clumsy attempts to poison Escobedo failed, Pérez recruited swordsmen to assassinate him. Pérez removed himself from Madrid and, on the night of March 31, 1578, in a narrow alley the assassins stabbed Escobedo to death. Insausti was the name of the killer and was helped by a group of loyals of Antonio Pérez, people from Aragon, where Antonio Pérez was from and where he was most powerful and influential. Immediately rumors were flying that Antonio Pérez was behind the killing.\n\nA few months later, on October 1, Don Juan died of Typhus in the Low Countries. (His body was cut in three parts and secretly passed through France to Spain where it was reassembled and given proper burial.)\n\nKing Philip soon became suspicious of the motives of his secretary and realized he had given his assent to a terrible crime. Nevertheless, he could not arrest him immediately as Pérez was a powerful man with information which could damage the king, including the murder of Escobedo.\n\nAt first the family of Escobedo demanded an investigation but later they gave up this claim. They were probably paid off by Antonio Pérez or someone close to him.\n\nOn 28 July 1579 Antonio Pérez and the Princess of Éboli were arrested by order of the king. The Princess of Éboli, as a proud woman who confronted the king, was kept imprisoned in different places, mostly on her palace in Pastrana, for the rest of her days. Antonio Pérez was more prudent and had compromising information so his situation with the king deteriorated slowly over time. At first he was under house arrest and had relative freedom but his liberty was gradually diminished. Also, he thought it might be possible for him to regain the favor of the king.\n\nIn 1584 he was subject to the judicial process called \"visita\" which was an auditing or review of his service as Secretary of the king. In this process he was formally accused of corruption and of altering ciphered messages to the king.\n\nOn 31 January 1585 he jumped out a window and sought asylum in a nearby church but the king's officers forced the door and arrested him without regard for the special judicial status of the church. This incident provoked a lawsuit from the church claiming infringements of their rights and demanding the man be returned to them but this claim went nowhere.\n\nAntonio Pérez was taken prisoner to the castle of Turégano, near Segovia. On 23 March he was notified of the sentence of the \"visita\" process: two years in prison, ten years banishment from the court with disqualification for all official posts as well as some monetary penalties.\n\nWhile at Turégano Antonio Pérez enjoyed relative freedom, his wife and children went to live with him and he soon assembled, as was his custom, a retinue of followers.\n\nAntonio Pérez plotted his own escape with the help of more followers who would take the castle at Turégano and overcome the guard. This group set up their base in the nearby village of Muñoveros and did manage to enter the castle in the middle of the night but the governor and his guard, outnumbered and against all odds, tricked them and convinced them to give up their attempt. As a result, Antonio Perez's property was confiscated and his wife and children were imprisoned in Madrid.\n\nFinally, in 1587 Antonio Pérez was formally accused of the 1578 murder of Escobedo. This judicial process progressed very slowly and during this time Antonio Pérez was kept prisoner but moved around different towns and castles. During all this time his conditions varied from harsh to relative freedom. The intention of the king was to recover the incriminating papers which Pérez still kept hidden somewhere. Pérez knew that his safety depended on having these papers and would not produce them and the king's tactics alternated between punishing him or giving him more freedom. But the king was becoming aware that he was not getting the papers he wanted.\n\nIn early 1590 Antonio Pérez was questioned under torture but he only confessed very vaguely implying the king was behind the killing. At this point he believed he may be sentenced to die and so, again, he planned his escape. On 19 April, with the help of his wife, Juana Coello, who was eight months pregnant, in the evening, he escaped his prison in Madrid. The escape was very carefully planned. With two loyal men he rode all night trying to gain the border of Aragon, separate kingdom with laws that protected him. In spite of his age and his poor physical state after being tortured, they rode all night changing horses along the Royal Posts. A second group followed a short while later, disguised as servants of a nobleman, with the purpose of tiring the Posts' horses and thus make them unavailable should any officers of the king try to follow.\n\nOnce in Aragon they rested in the Monastery of Santa María de Huerta, then in Aragon (although this is not the case today as the border was later moved). A group of followers came to join them there with fresh horses and, further on, a military escort. He demanded the judicial process known as \"manifestación\" which made him subject to the laws and justice of Aragon (fueros) and this was immediately granted. With this he could not be extradited to Castile without a formal judicial process. He then moved slowly towards Zaragoza while he raised his supporters. On May 1 he entered triumphantly in Zaragoza surrounded by his followers and escorts. There he was put in the prison of \"manifestados\" subject to the justice of Aragon which for him meant protection from the king and the judicial process in Castile. In the prison of \"manifestados\" Antonio Pérez had great liberty. He received his friends and prepared his defense. He had access to all his documents which had been sent to Aragón even before his escape.\n\nIn the meanwhile the king had immediately set the judicial process in motion. On 23 April, even before Antonio Pérez had arrived in Zaragoza, a new judicial process was initiated by the king against Antonio Pérez in Aragon accusing him of being responsible of the murder of Escobedo, of having given the king false information with the purpose of getting him to approve the extrajudicial killing, of using secrets of State for his own ends and of falsifying messages to the king as he deciphered them as well as having escaped from prison.\n\nOn 1 July the judge in Madrid, Rodrigo de Arce, issued a death sentence against Antonio Pérez.\n\nTo prevent any escape attempt a special guard was placed outside the prison of \"manifestados\" by order of the king and Antonio Pérez used this to his advantage by playing the issue as one of Castile infringing on the sovereignty of Aragon. By linking his case to that of the rights and freedoms of Aragon (known as fueros), Antonio Pérez cleverly obtained the support of the people of Aragon.\n\nThe courts of Aragon hindered the judicial process and it seemed Antonio Pérez would be found innocent so the king's accusation was withdrawn and a new, similar, accusation was presented by the king's representative in Aragon, Iñigo de Mendoza y de la Cerda, Marquis of Almenara. Also, on 1 September, a new accusation was presented by the king as king of Aragon. In this new accusation Antonio Pérez was accused of serving king Philip badly in matters relating to Aragon but Antonio Pérez claimed as defense that he never served the king in any matters related to Aragon. \n\nIn 1591 Pérez made an unsuccessful attempt to escape and the judicial processes were moving very slowly. The king then resorted to the farce of accusing Antonio Pérez of heresy through the Inquisition which was an ecclesiastical organization and had jurisdiction in both Castile and Aragon. The purpose of this was to bypass the judicial system of Aragón.\n\nOn 13 May Antonio Pérez was moved to a prison in the \"Aljafería\" which caused riots of the people of Aragon who considered this an affront and a violation of their laws. In the riots the marquis of Almenara, representative of the king, was killed and soon Antonio Pérez was triumphantly returned to the prison of \"manifestados\".\n\nThe situation was growing chaotic, the local authorities escaped in fear of the rioters and Pérez was planning his escape to France when the king ordered the invasion of Aragon by troops of Castile in a watershed move against the specific laws of Aragon and its limited self-government.\n\nOn 10 November 1591 Antonio Pérez fled Zaragoza and two days later the Aragonese armies crumbled and the royalist armies entered Zaragoza without opposition.\n\nThe king gave order that the Chief Justice, Juan de Lanuza y Urrea, be executed without trial and on December 20, 1591, his head was exhibited for all the terrified people to see.\n\nOn the night of 23 November, disguised as a shepherd and in heavy snow, Antonio Pérez crossed the Pyrenees into the Kingdom of Bearn-Navarre. He first went to Pau in Béarn where Catherine, sister of Henry III of Navarre (IV of France), governed.\n\nHe spent the rest of his life trying to make a living off the sale of the secrets he knew, but he failed to make an impression on Queen Elizabeth I and her chief minister William Cecil. In 1593 he arrived in England as a guest of Anthony Bacon and he was admired by the Essex circle for his knowledge of Tacitism. It was the printer Richard Field who printed Perez' \"Pedacos de Historia o Relaciones\". He was a guest of Francis Bacon's on the famous Night of Errors at Gray's Inn when the throng of disorderly people nearly prevented a performance of \"A Comedy of Errors\".\n\nHe was the target of several unsuccessful assassination attempts, originating with the Spanish Government: Patrick O'Collun and John Annias, executed in 1594 for conspiracy to kill the Queen, initially confessed only to an attempt to kill Perez, and the royal physician Rodrigo Lopez, who was executed for the same crime, was a party to a separate plot to kill him.\n\nIt has been claimed that Perez was mocked in \"Love's Labour's Lost\" in the persona of the preposterous Spaniard Don Armado. Gustav Ungerer argued that there were many similarities between Perez and Armado, including their prose style and their love life.\n\nPerez was recalled to France by Henry of Navarre, now Henry IV. He remained there until the end of his days except for several travels to England.\n\nPerez's \"Relaciones\" along with the Apologia written by William of Orange in 1580, are largely responsible for the Black Legend that has grown around Philip II.\n\nKing Philip died in 1598; and the wife and children of Antonio Pérez, who were still imprisoned in Madrid, were set free.\n\nIn 1611 Antonio Pérez died in Paris and was interred in a convent, but his remains were lost during the desecrations of the French Revolution.\n\n\n"}

He then served as the musical director of the sketch-comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" from 1985 to 1995, where he was the leader of the Saturday Night Live Band.\n\nHis own albums include \"In The World\" (1981), \"Get A Little\" (with the Saturday Night Live Band, 1993) and \"Incense, Herbs and Oils\" (1998). Smith was the lead guitarist for the band Moonalice from 2007 to 2009.\n\nSmith has performed and recorded with many artists, including Hall & Oates, Tina Turner, and David Bowie. He played guitar in Roger Waters' The Wall Live tour, and was lead guitarist in Bob Dylan's touring band 1988 to 1990. Smith also served as musical director of Dylan's The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration at Madison Square Garden on October 16, 1992. His band provided entertainment at the 2012 and 2016 Republican National Convention.\n\nSmith was born January 27, 1952, in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, as George Edward Haddad, a Lebanese-American whose last name means blacksmith in Arabic. He started playing guitar at the age of 4. In 1959, at the age of 7, he was given a C. F. Martin guitar. On his 11th birthday Smith's mother bought him his first electric guitar, a Fender Telecaster, a model that dated to 1952, his birth year. By then he was already earning money as a musician, playing in numerous venues such as Poconos resorts and high school dances.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Smith left the Poconos for the New Haven, Connecticut, area, where he played in a group called the Scratch Band, which also included his future Hall & Oates bandmate Mickey Curry. In late 1977 Smith got his first break, with Dan Hartman, fresh off his hit \"Instant Replay\". He hired the guitarist to front his band for a \"lip-sync tour\" of Europe and the U.S. Upon his return to the East coast, Smith moved to Manhattan and became the guitarist for Gilda Radner's 1979 Broadway show \"Gilda Live\". Radner and Smith became friends and married shortly afterward, divorcing in 1982. In 1981 he released his first solo album, \"In the World\", with Paul Simon and Radner singing backup on the album. In 1992 he recorded his second album, this time with the Saturday Night Live Band entitled \"Get A Little\".\n\nIn the midst of his \"SNL\" tenure Smith toured for almost two and a half years with Bob Dylan during the \"Neverending Tour\" from 1988 until October 1990.\n\nDuring his \"SNL\" years Smith was the musical director for special events such as the 1988 Emmy Awards, the 1993 Rhythm and Blues Foundation Awards, Bob Dylan's 30th Anniversary Concert at Madison Square Garden as well as acting as the musical director at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concert in Cleveland. Smith also has written with his friend and fellow musician Jimmy Buffett. \"Six String Music\" appears on Buffett's album \"Fruitcakes\". In 1996, Smith received a Grammy nomination for his work with Buddy Guy on the album \"Live: The Real Deal\"\n\nSmith released his next CD \"Incense Herbs, and Oils\" in 1998. Between live dates, he has been the musical director and band leader honoring Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson at the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C. He also led bands for The Muddy Waters Tribute, and the 1998 and 1999 Mark Twain Awards honoring Richard Pryor and Jonathan Winters which aired on PBS, and Comedy Central.\n\nDuring 2004-2006, GE raised the stakes for the Cleveland Browns where he headed up home games for the team with his music, rocking the NFL with classic rock and his mantra, “Brownstown.”\nIn 2005, Smith and his band appeared on the Comedy Central Roast of Jeff Foxworthy and did a performance with the band Bama.\n\nSmith toured with Roger Waters during the 2010–2013 tour The Wall Live.

(The name is pronounced \"gory & defeated\".)\n\nThe Gorre & Daphetid, also known as \"The Gorre\" or just \"The G&D,\" was actually three successive model railroads. The first two small versions were built at Allen's home in Monterey. The final version of the G&D, which incorporated the earliest layout, was much larger and built over a period of twenty years at his new 9 Cielo Vista Terrace home in Monterey, where he excavated part of the basement to build the railroad. Mr. Allen was a pioneer in the field of model railroading - as a professional photographer he had the artistic talent and attention to detail to create and document incredibly realistic scenes, and did so in numerous articles featured in \"Model Railroader\", the NMRA's \"Scale Rails\" and \"Railroad Model Craftsman\" magazines. He developed a wonderful story of origin, including humor and numerous references to his friends in the model railroading and model railroading publishing industry. He designed and built numerous buildings and people. The final layout is considered one of the greatest layouts of all time, and has several fan websites and a devoted Yahoo discussion groups.\n\nThe basement of the house was severely damaged by fire just ten days after John Allen suffered a fatal heart attack in January 1973. Most of the layout was destroyed in the fire. However, one of the locomotives, No. 34, a 4-10-0 that John kitbashed from parts, resided in the office of the late former \"Model Railroader\" magazine executive editor Andy Sperandeo.

{"id": "1892204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892204", "title": "Willets Point, Queens", "text": "Willets Point, Queens\n\nWillets Point, also known locally as the Iron Triangle, is an industrial neighborhood within Corona, in the New York City borough of Queens. Located east of Citi Field near the Flushing River, it is known for its automobile shops and junkyards, and had a population of 10 people in 2011.\n\nProposals to redevelop Willets Point started after World War II, but gained full traction in 2007. New York City Council members and the few residents of the area strongly opposed the original plan, leading to several years of lawsuits. In 2011, the city began a $4 billion redevelopment project began to construct a retail shopping center, residential buildings with a combined 3,000 units, an entertainment complex, and a public school. The New York City Economic Development Corporation's plan to redevelop the area was approved in 2013, and demolition of the industrial section of Willets Point began in 2016.\n\nThe new development was originally set to open in stages between 2018 and 2032. However, the redevelopment plans were changed after a New York state court blocked the construction of the shopping center. The development was re-approved in February 2018.\n\nWillets Point is bounded by Northern Boulevard to the north, 126th Street and Citi Field to the west, Roosevelt Avenue and Flushing Meadows–Corona Park to the south, and the Flushing River to the east. The New York City Subway's Mets–Willets Point station, serving the , is located at the southwest corner of the area, at Roosevelt Avenue and 126th Street. The neighborhood is part of Queens Community District 7.\n\nWillets Point is zoned mostly for industrial activity. It has no sidewalks or sewers , and due to the area's geography and the lack of paved roads in the area, flooding is common during heavy rains. The area consists mostly of auto repair shops, scrap yards, waste processing sites, and similar small businesses. It has been described as being \"post-apocalyptic\" in appearance. A Hunter College study in April 2006 found that Willets Point was a \"unique regional destination\" for auto parts and repairs, and that the 225 businesses in the area employed a combined 1,400 to 1,800 people at the time. It had a population of 10 people . The concentration of auto-repair shops resulted in the area's nickname of the \"Iron Triangle.\"\n\nThe area was named after that portion of Willets Point Boulevard lying west of Flushing Creek, which flows northward past the area. Willets Point Boulevard once crossed a now-demolished bridge over Flushing Creek and continued to the Willets Point cape, at the confluence of the East River and Long Island Sound. The original Willets Point is the site of Fort Totten near Bayside, but over the course of the 20th century it became commonplace to apply the name \"Willets Point\" (derived from the street, rather than the geographical feature) to the area on the Flushing River instead. The neighborhood, street, and cape's name are all derived from the Willets family, whose land the government bought in 1857 to build Fort Totten (originally named \"Fort at Willets Point\").\nBy the end of World War II, Willets Point was known as an area of auto junkyards. Since then, several redevelopment plans for Willets Point were proposed, but never implemented. Before the 1964 New York World's Fair, Robert Moses tried to incorporate Willets Point into Flushing Meadows–Corona Park but failed when the junkyard owners hired Mario Cuomo as their lawyer. Shea Stadium, a multipurpose stadium in Willets Point, was opened in 1964, the same year as the World's Fair.\n\nAfter the New York Jets left Shea Stadium at the end of the 1983 season to play at the Meadowlands, Willets Point was the proposed location for a new, 82,000-seat domed football stadium that would bring the Jets back to New York. After the Jets decided to remain in New Jersey, the proposed stadium was also discussed as a potential new home for the St. Louis Cardinals of the NFL, the Atlanta Falcons, and the New Jersey Generals. By the 1990s, the New York Mets were looking to replace the aging Shea Stadium.\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg started planning for the redevelopment of Willets Point in 2002. Citi Field was originally proposed as part of the city's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, which was submitted in 2005. Willets Point was supposed to contain athlete's housing. Even though New York City lost the bid to London, the plans for Citi Field progressed anyway. Following Citi Field's completion, Shea Stadium was demolished in 2009. Since 2009, the neighborhood has been discussed as a potential site for the New York Islanders to move to, as well as a Major League Soccer team.\n\nOn May 1, 2007, Mayor Bloomberg announced his administration's new plan for urban renewal in the area. The plan called for replacing the scrapyards and industrial sites with a sustainable and affordable mixed-use development including a convention center, 5,500 units of housing, of retail, for a school, of office space, Community Facility, as well as environmental remediation, installation of sewers and other infrastructure, and relocation of previous businesses. Willets Point would create more than 5,300 permanent jobs and add 18,000 construction jobs.\n\nOn April 9, 2008, the Willets Point Industry and Realty Association (WPIRA), a group of the 10 largest business and land owners in Willets Point, filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the City of New York seeking a court order requiring the City to provide infrastructure improvements, including repairs to streets and storm sewers, installation of sanitary sewers, street lights, street signs and other services that the City had allegedly withheld for over 40 years, as well as unspecified damages for past neglect. Judge Edward R Korman granted the City's motion to dismiss this lawsuit on November 25, 2009.\n\nOn April 21, 2008, a majority of the New York City Council's members expressed their \"adamant opposition\" to the proposed Willets Point redevelopment in writing to Robert Lieber, New York City's Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. The \"adamant opposition\" letter was signed by 29 City Council members. Three days later, Queens elected officials, various union members and others rallied at a press conference on the steps of New York City Hall. The gathering was in support of having the City move forward with the proposed development of Willets Point. The rally was led by Queens Borough President Helen Marshall. Also in attendance were state senators Frank Padavan and Toby Ann Stavisky and Assembly Member Nettie Mayersohn, former Queens Borough President Claire Shulman and Queens Chamber of Commerce President Al Pennisi who spoke about the vital role the development would play in the Queens business community.\n\nOn June 30, 2008, the plan was approved with numerous conditions by Queens Community Board 7 and by the City Planning Commission on September 24, 2008. The City Council held a public hearing regarding the plan on October 17 and voted on November 13, 2008 to approve the redevelopment plan, which includes the potential use of eminent domain to acquire property. Some property owners have vowed to try to stop the plan through litigation, while others voluntarily sold their property to the City during the fall of 2008 so as to avert involuntary taking of their property through eminent domain and relocation by the New York City Economic Development Corporation. On July 31, 2009, the Corporation announced plans to invest $100 million into infrastructure projects in Queens that would include development in Willets Point.\n\nIn March 2009, Joseph Ardizzone, the only resident of Willets Point at the time, as well several local businesses filed another lawsuit in state court. The new suit challenged the City's approval of the development plan and contending that the plan had undergone inadequate environmental review. Allegations arose in 2009 that the City of New York and its Economic Development Corporation had improperly provided funding to organizations that lobbied the City Council in favor of the Willets Point development plan. In May 2010 the New York City Department of Transportation opened a new Municipal Asphalt Plant on Harper Street, on the north side of Willets Point.\n\nIn 2011, the $4 billion redevelopment project began. The next year, the city changed the agreement to include a mall with 200 stores, as well as a 2,500-unit housing development, of which 875 would be affordable housing. This caused a change in public opinion, and many of the project's original supporters came to oppose the mall. A draft supplemental environmental impact statement (EIS) was published on March 15, 2013, and a final EIS was published on August 9. At the time of the FEIS's approval, the redevelopment area consisted of four parking lots around Citi Field, as well as a \"Special Willets Point District\" consisting of a triangle-shaped area where most of the industry was located. On October 9 of the same year, the City Council approved the Willets Point redevelopment plan.\n\nIn phase 1A of the plan, which was expected to be completed in 2018, a 200-room hotel would have been constructed alongside a retail area of , connected by an esplanade at 126th Street. There would have been a temporary 2,825-spot parking lot east of the hotel and retail area, which would host recreational events for at least half the year. Meanwhile, one of Citi Field's western parking lots would have been demolished to make room for a mall with of leasable retail space and up to 200 stores including anchors. The mall would have included a food court, a movie theater, and a new 2,900-spot parking structure. Another 1,800-spot parking structure would have replaced an existing 640-spot western portion of Citi Field's South Lot south of Roosevelt Avenue. Even after Phase 1A was finished, there would still be a portion of the Willets Point triangle for automotive and industrial uses.\n\nPhase 1B of the plan would have taken ten more years to build, and would have complete by 2028. The temporary 2,825-spot lot would have been gradually redeveloped into of \"residential, retail, additional hotel, office, parking, and community facility\" development, as well as a public school and of parkland. The eastern portion of the South Lot, as well as Lot D to the east, would have been replaced with two 6-floor parking structures. This proposal for Phase 1B would have followed the same zoning map as in Phase 1A. As in Phase 1A, a smaller portion of the Willets Point triangle wasremain for automotive and industrial uses. Since the streets in this part of the redevelopment project slope downward, the Phase 1B development would have also graded downward toward the industrial section of the neighborhood. The Van Wyck Expressway would also have had two new access ramps to serve Phase 1B. The city allocated $66 million of their budget for the design and construction of the new ramps.\n\nHousing would have been built as part of the second phase of the project, set to be complete by 2032. There would have been 2,490 housing units, of which 35%, or 1,000, will be affordable units. However, in the 2013 FEIS, the EDC stipulated that there might be up to 5,850 housing units, which would comprise a combined of space. There would also be of retail space; of office space; of space for a new convention center; for a hotel or hotels with a combined 700 rooms; for a community center; for a public school; and of parkland. Parking would also be expanded up to 6,700 spaces based on demand. Lot B, located between Citi Field and Roosevelt Avenue, would likely have a retail area, a parking lot, and a 10-floor office building. This would significantly alter the zoning for the area, but would also bring more economic activity into Flushing and Corona.\n\nIn 2014, Bill de Blasio replaced Michael Bloomberg as mayor of New York City. He opposed the redevelopment plan because of the lack of affordable housing, but the City Council approved the project in 2015. State Senator Tony Avella and a small community group sued to stop the mall from being built. In June 2015, a state court ruled that the mall could not be built on a parking lot in Willets Point. The developers appealed the lawsuit, but the city's government refused to join in on the appeal.\n\nBy the end of July 2016, the last auto repair shops between 38th and Roosevelt Avenues had been closed and demolition had started on the development, now priced at US$4 billion. Most Willets Points business owners either went out of business or moved to Hunts Point, Bronx. Actual construction on the Phase 1 shopping area was halted by a 2015 lawsuit, which was filed to prevent the retail area from being built in a portion of the neighborhood that is legally part of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. The suit did not preclude any other part of Phase 1A from being built. The New York Supreme Court, which began hearing arguments in April 2017, ruled against the construction of the mall on June 6.\n\nIn February 2018, the de Blasio administration and developers came to an agreement in which 1,100 lower- and middle-class apartments, a 450-pupil school, parks, and of retail space would be built. The new plan did not include a mall, as the original plan had. Under the agreement, the developers The Related Companies and Sterling Equities were expected to clear all toxic materials from Willets Point by 2020, and the first 500 apartments were expected to open by 2022.\n\nThe \"Valley of Ashes\" described in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel \"The Great Gatsby\" is said to have been inspired by a former dump (now the location of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park) in Willets Point. The 2007 film \"Chop Shop\" was also filmed and set in this neighborhood. The 2010 dramatic film \"Willets Point\", directed by T. J. Collins, is set in the neighborhood.\n\nThe 2018 documentary \"The Iron Triangle\", directed by Prudence Katze and William Lehman, describes the history behind the destruction of the once-thriving neighborhood.\n\nNeutral Drop, an automotive YouTube channel, films many of their videos in the streets and backlots of the Iron Triangle.\n"}
{"id": "1892207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892207", "title": "Geology of Connecticut", "text": "Geology of Connecticut\n\nAs part of New England, Connecticut has undergone much geologic change shaped by plate tectonics, volcanism, and glacial activity.\n\nDuring the early Triassic period, the super-continent Pangea was formed as the Iapetus Ocean closed up and the proto-North American continent collided with Avalonia, part of modern-day Africa. This caused great uplift and the creation of the Appalachian Mountains, which, at the time, were bigger than modern-day Himalayas. Erosion of the Appalachian Mountains now exposes metamorphic rocks once very deep in the Earth's mantle and uplifted during this time period.\n\nAbout 200 million years after this collision and the formation of Pangea, during the middle of the Mesozoic Era, the Atlantic Ocean floor started spreading and great extensional forces were experienced, resulting in faulting. Connecticut's Eastern border fault was created, a fault which begins in New Haven and stretches 130 miles up to Keene, New Hampshire. As a result, the land west of this fault was downset, creating a rift valley and causing the land to tilt an average of 15 to 25 degrees. The fault is currently inactive. The formation of this basin eventually refilled with soft fluvial and alluvial sediments.\n\nDuring Ice Ages, glacial activity shaped much of New England’s landscape, eroding mountains, leaving glacial till scattered everywhere, and forming glacial lakes. At its greatest extent, one of these glaciers left behind a moraine which became today's Long Island. One of the biggest glacial lakes of the time was Glacial Lake Hitchcock. It formed when the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated and glacial meltwater began to accumulate at the glacier's terminal moraine in Rocky Hill, Connecticut and back up into the Connecticut River. The glacial lake left behind a soft, varved landscape, gathering silt and sand in the summertime due to the influx of glacial meltwater and clay in the wintertime as the lake froze until it was later drained.\n\nThis soft surface has since been downcut, resedimented and oft flooded by the Connecticut River, making it a very soft, nutrient-replenished area and host to the majority of Connecticut's farmland soils. The land on either side of the Connecticut River Valley is less suitable for farmlands. The eastern section holds the shallow Proto-North American Terrane while the western section contains the Iapetos and Avalonian Terranes, which still holds remnants of glacial till and lack the soft fluvial sediments so prominent in the Connecticut River Valley region.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1892215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892215", "title": "Secretariat of State (Holy See)", "text": "Secretariat of State (Holy See)\n\nThe Secretariat of State is the oldest dicastery in the Roman Curia, the central papal governing bureaucracy of the Catholic Church. It is headed by the Cardinal Secretary of State and performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See. The Secretariat is divided into three sections, the Section for General Affairs, the Section for Relations with States, and, since 2017, the Section for Diplomatic Staff.\n\nThe origins of the Secretariat of State go back to the fifteenth century. The apostolic constitution \"Non Debet Reprehensibile\" of 31 December 1487 established the \"Secretaria Apostolica\" comprising twenty-four apostolic secretaries, one of whom bore the title \"Secretarius Domesticus\" and held a position of pre-eminence. One can also trace to this \"Secretaria Apostolica\" the Chancery of Briefs, the Secretariat of Briefs to Princes and the Secretariat of Latin Letters.\n\nPope Leo X established another position, the \"Secretarius Intimus\", to assist the Cardinal who had control of the affairs of State and to attend to correspondence in languages other than Latin, chiefly with the Apostolic Nuncios (who at that time were evolving into permanent diplomatic representatives). From these beginnings, the Secretariat of State developed, especially at the time of the Council of Trent.\n\nFor a long time, the \"Secretarius Intimus\", also called \"Secretarius Papae\" or \"Secretarius Maior\", was almost always a prelate, often endowed with episcopal rank. It was only at the beginning of the pontificate of Innocent X that someone already a Cardinal and not a member of the Pope's family was called to this high office. Pope Innocent XII definitively abolished the office of Cardinal Nephew, and the powers of that office were assigned to the Cardinal Secretary of State alone.\n\nOn 19 July 1814, Pope Pius VII established the Sacred Congregation for the Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, expanding the \"Congregatio super negotiis ecclesiasticis Regni Galliarum\" established by Pius VI in 1793. With the apostolic constitution \"Sapienti Consilio\" of 29 June 1908, Saint Pius X divided the Sacred Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in the form fixed by the \"Codex Iuris Canonici\" of 1917 (Can. 263) and he specified the duties of each of the three sections: the first was concerned essentially with extraordinary affairs, while the second attended to the ordinary affairs, and the third, until then an independent body (the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs), had the duty of preparing and dispatching pontifical Briefs.\n\nWith the apostolic constitution \"Regimini Ecclesiae universae\" of 15 August 1967, Pope Paul VI reformed the Roman Curia, implementing the desire expressed by the bishops in the Second Vatican Council. This gave a new face to the Secretariat of State, suppressing the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs, formerly the third section, and transforming the former first section, the Sacred Congregation for the Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, into a body distinct from the Secretariat of State, though closely related to it, which was to be known as the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church.\n\nOn 28 June 1988, John Paul II promulgated the apostolic constitution \"Pastor bonus\", which introduced a reform of the Roman Curia and divided the Secretariat of State into two sections: the Section for General Affairs and the Section for Relations with States, which incorporated the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church. Pope Francis added a third unit, the Section for Diplomatic Staff, in November 2017.\n\nThe head of the Secretariat of State is the Secretary of State, who is a cardinal. The Cardinal Secretary of State is primarily responsible for the diplomatic and political activity of the Holy See, in some circumstances representing the Pope himself.\n\nThe Section for General Affairs handles the normal operations of the Church including organizing the activities of the Roman Curia, making appointments to curial offices, publishing official communications, papal documents, handling the concerns of embassies to the Holy See, and keeping the papal seal and Fisherman's Ring. Abroad, the Section for General Affairs is responsible for organizing the activities of nuncios around the world in their activities concerning the local church.\n\nThe Section for General Affairs is headed by an archbishop known as the Substitute for General Affairs, or more formally, Substitute for General Affairs to the Secretary of State. The current Substitute for General Affairs to the Secretary of State is Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra. There have been 10 substitutes since 1953:\n\nThe deputy to the Substitute for General Affairs, effectively deputy chief of staff, is called the Assessor for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State. The current Assessor for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State is Monsignor Luigi Roberto Cona.\n\n\nThe Congregation for the Ecclesiastical Affairs of the Kingdom of France was set up by Pope Pius VI with the Constitution \"Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum\" in 1793 to deal with the problems created for the Church by the French Revolution. In 1814, Pope Pius VII gave this office responsibility for negotiations with all governments, renaming it the Extraordinary Congregation for the Ecclesiastical Affairs of the Catholic World (). Some years later, Pope Leo XII changed its name to the Sacred Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs (), which remained its title until 1967 when Pope Paul VI separated this body from the Secretariat of State, calling it the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church. This Council was later replaced by the present Section for Relations with States.\n\nThe Section is responsible for the Holy See's interactions with civil governments. According to the relevant articles of the apostolic constitution \"Pastor bonus\", the responsibilities of the Secretary for Relations with States are:\n\nThe Section is headed by an Archbishop, the Secretary for Relations with States, who reports to the Secretary of State. His staff includes a Prelate, the Under-Secretary for Relations with States, and is assisted by Cardinals and Bishops. The Secretary for Relations with States is often called the foreign minister of the Holy See, and the Under-Secretary is often called the deputy foreign minister.\n\nThe current Secretary for Relations with States is Archbishop Paul Gallagher.

In the regional ductus, the last syllable of the name is stressed as \"Sankt yo-Hahn'\".\n\nSt. Johann is situated in the Leukental, which extends from Jochberg to the \"Streichen\" close to the Bavarian border. This region was already settled in the 4th century BC by a Celtic tribe, the Ambisontiers, who pursued copper mining in the surrounding mountains.\n\nIn 15 BC the Romans conquered the Eastern Alpine region and the Leukental became part of the Roman province of Noricum. Following the downfall of the West Roman Empire in 476 AD the region went to the Duchy of Bavaria in the 7th century in the wake of the European migrations and as result of the settlement of the Germanic tribe of the Bavarii.\n\nIn the following centuries the nobles of the House of Liuchinger, after whom the Leukental is named, established a county in the valley. The Liuchingers lived at Leukenstein Castle, which is located at the foot of the \"Niederkaiser\". The exact site of the castle, which was also the judicial seat for the county, is no longer known today, but is recalled by the farm name of \"Burgwiesen\" (\"castle meadows\"). Following the extinction of the Liuchingers around 1170, their county ended up in the hands of the Falkensteins, but this noble family also died out after just 70 years and the county in the Leukental was subsequently ruled by officials representing the Bavarian dukes.\n\nIn the 8th century (probably before 738), the missionaries built a Catholic church in the region of St. Johann, which was dedicated to St. John the Evangelist and who gave St. Johann its name.\nThe church of \"St. Johannes\" was first mentioned in a document in the year 1150.\n\nIn 1446, the bishops of Chiemsee were given the responsibility of the parish of St. Johann, from which time onwards it became their summer residence.\n\nThe opening of the copper and silver mines in 1540 increased the wealth of St. Johann. The mines were located in the small hills, known as Rerobichl close to Oberndorf, which belonged to St. Johann. In the 17th century the \"Heilig-Geist-Schacht\" (\"Holy Ghost Shaft\") was the deepest shaft in the world, over deep.\n\nThe mining of copper and silver continued until the 18th century. In 1875, the construction of the Gisela Railway linked St. Johann to the international railway network, with the result that the economy boomed and tourism began to take hold.\n\nIn 1927, Oberndorf and St. Johann split and from this time onwards Oberndorf became a separate parish. In 1954, St. Johann received its own Coat of Arms; in 1956, St. Johann reached the elevated status of a market town.\n\nSt. Johann lies in a valley basin between the mountain range of the Wilder Kaiser and mountain called the Kitzbüheler Horn in the centre of the district of Kitzbühel.\nThe Kitzbühler Ache (small river), the Fieberbrunner Ache and the Reither Ache unite in St. Johann and run into Bavaria as the Tiroler Ache, or the Gross Ache. The center of town is approximately above sea level, the Local Authority area comprises a surface area of .\n\nSt. Johann consists of: Almdorf, Apfeldorf, Bärnstetten, Berglehen, Fricking, Hinterkaiser, Mitterndorf, Niederhofen, Oberhofen, Reitham, Rettenbach, Scheffau, Sperten, Taxa, Weiberndorf, Weitau, Winkl Schattseite, Winkl Sonnseite\n\nOn the day of the census in 2001 (final result in 2004) St. Johann had 7,959 inhabitants. The population of the town is steadily increasing; in 2004 it was growing at 1.8 per cent. Since autumn 2007 St. Johann in Tirol has been the most populous municipality in the district of Kitzbühel.\n\nCurrent population figures (as at 31 December 2010) show that the municipality of St. Johann occupies first place in the top ten.\n\nThe parish council (\"Gemeinderat\" or \"Ortsparlament\") comprises 19 members, the \"Bürgermeister\" acting as chairman.\n\nThe council is made up as follows (2010):\n\nThe St. Johann parish board consists of seven members. It is chaired by the \"Bürgermeister\" who is directly elected by the villagers of St. Johann. The two vice \"Bürgermeisters\" are chosen by the council.\n\n\nOn 13 May 1954 the Tyrolean state government granted the following coat of arms to the municipality of St. Johann in Tirol:\n\n\"In a green and red vertically-divided shield are, on the right, an inverted, silver ibex horn and, on the left, a gold bishop's crozier.\"\n\nThe shield bears the colours of the old flag of the court, whose first seat was in St. Johann before 1271. The ibex horn commemorates the \"nobles of Velben\" (\"Edlen von Velben\") who lived near St. Johann in the 13th and 14th centuries. The bishop's crozier recalls that the village used to be a summer residence for the bishops of Chiemsee.\n\n\nTourism and the restaurant trade are amongst the most important branches of the economy in the area. With approximately 520,000 overnight stays per year, roughly evenly split between summer and winter, St. Johann is one of the major tourist resorts in the Tyrol. Its holiday infrastructure ranges from hotels to campsites and from restaurants to discothèques.\n\nIn recent decades, St. Johann has experienced an economic boom in trade, services and light industry and it has become the shopping centre for the district of Kitzbühel. Many new firms have settled here, especially along the B 178 federal road, where they benefit from its central location. In addition, the opening of a pedestrian zone in the 1990s has improved the town centre, which receives an average of 20,000 visitors per day.\n\nSeveral firms are based in St. Johann, such as the headquarters of the Fritz Egger GmbH & Co, one of the best known chip board manufacturers in Europe.\n\nToday, the region around St. Johann in Tirol is one of the agricultural centres of Tyrol, despite its harsh climate and heavy precipitation. Agriculture in the wide basin of the St. Johann bowl has a great tradition as the former breadbasket of Tyrol and, even today, farming continues to play an important role.\n\nA relatively large number (for the Tyrol) of farms are established in the wide, level basin and on its fairly gently (with a few exceptions) slopes. According to \"Statistik Austria\" about a third of the farms are form the main source of income. These primary income farms use rather more than half the agricultural and forested land in the municipality.\n\nSt. Johann in Tirol is an important tourist centre with impressive ski-slopes and related facilities. The ski resorts are especially populous starting after Christmas into early January. It is also popular in summer, especially with British, Irish and German tourists. Located near the Wilder Kaiser (Wild Emperor) mountains, the Kitzbühler Horn dominates the town. It is well served by ski lifts and cable car.\n\nSt. Johann is a major traffic junction, to which the following roads are connected: B 178 - Loferer Straße; B 164 - Hochkönig Straße; B 176 - Kössener Straße; B 161 - Pass Thurn Straße. European route E641, which connects Wörgl with Salzburg, passes through St. Johann in Tirol, intersecting here with highway B161 to Mittersill.\n\nThe market town also has an express train station on the route of the Giselabahn, which is also called the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway and has access to the international railway network to Salzburg, Innsbruck and to Munich via Wörgl.\n\nIn addition there is an airport for light aircraft and gliders, airfield (ICAO Code LOIJ), used by light aircraft, parachutists and gliders: runway length , radio frequency 120,350 MHz, , altitude. It is the second largest airport in Tyrol.\n\nThe distance between St. Johann and Salzburg is , between St. Johann and Innsbruck , and between St. Johann and Munich .\n\nIn St. Johann there are some important public services, like the district hospital, the Wintersteller army barracks and the Military Supply Centre West for the Armed Forces based in the west of Austria.\n\nAdditionally you can find the following institutions in St. Johann: the District Forest Inspector, the District Administration for Agriculture, the Road Maintenance Department, the nursing home in St. Johann, the health and social care service and the police department.\n\nThe market town has water supply, sewage and waste disposal systems that are organised by the parish council. In addition to electricity and natural gas there has also been an environmentally friendly district heating system since the end of 2008 which supplies the largest buildings in the village.\n\nSince December 2007 The St. Johann Village Heating Company (\"Ortswärme St. Johann in Tirol GmbH\") has supplied households, firms and public institutions in St. Johann in Tirol with district heating. \nThe firm is 74% owned by the parish of St. Johann in Tirol and 26% by the firm of Fritz Egger.\nThe head office is in \"Bahnhofstraße 5\", in the parish office. The heating company does not have its own energy generation with the exception of backup and peak-load boilers in the centre of the village. The energy is generated by the Egger factory from waste heat and biomass in conjunction with an absorption heat pump and is transferred at the boundary of the factory site into the district heating network. At the end of 2009 around 400 buildings and 1,300 households in St. Johann were heated by district heating. These include the district hospital, the barracks, the schools, traders, single and multi-family homes. A total of about of routing, or (double) of piping has been laid. In 2009, of heating was purchased, that corresponds to an oil consumption of about per year. In the medium term the introduction of district heating in St. Johann will save about 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually in the village centre. To read the heat meters and to visualize the individual house systems, an optical fibre was laid as part of the installation of the heating district network.\n\n\n\nThere are many sports facilities for locals and visitors alike:\n\nSince 2004 St. Johann has a modern event hall : the Kaisersaal. The term is derived from the mountain chain \"Der Wilde Kaiser\". There are many events such as lectures, corporate events and pop or rock concerts in this hall.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on the southwest side of the city. Its community neighbors include Gage Park, West Englewood, Ashburn, and West Lawn. It is bounded by Bell Avenue on the east, Central Park Avenue on the west, 59th Street on the north, and 75th Street on the south, and is southwest of the Loop. Local citizens refer to the area as \"Marquette Park,\" after the park in its center.\n\nThe city of Chicago Lawn was founded by John F. Eberhart in 1871. Although it was annexed by the city of Chicago in 1889, it remained mostly farmland with some scattered settlements until the 1920s. Between 1920 and 1930 the population increased from 14,000 to 47,000. Residents of German and Irish descent began to move into the area from the Back of the Yards and Englewood neighborhoods. Poles, Bohemians, and Lithuanians followed them. Most new residents belonged to various Protestant denominations, but Chicago Lawn also was home to many Roman Catholic churches and schools. Today, there are six Catholic institutions that make up the Marquette Park Catholic Campus Council. Chicago Lawn was a thriving urban neighborhood as the Depression hit the nation and by 1940 its population had reached 49,291. In 1941, the National Biscuit Company announced plans to build a huge bakery in Chicago Lawn. When completed, this was the largest bakery in one location in the world. The size of the facility was doubled in the late 1990s.\n\nThe Lithuanian community has maintained a notable presence in the area by establishing a network of institutions that earned their community the label as \"the Lithuanian Gold Coast\". They formed some of the richest savings and loans in the city. The Lithuanian Sisters of Saint Casimir founded Holy Cross Hospital in 1928 and Maria High School in 1952 (originally established as St. Casimir Academy in 1911). The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church was established in 1927 on the corner of 69th Street and Washtenaw Avenue. It was founded as a Lithuanian national parish and services are still held in Lithuanian. An Art Deco monument was erected by Chicago's Lithuanian community in Marquette Park commemorating Lithuanian pilots Stasys Girėnas and Steponas Darius who died in the crash of the Lituanica in 1933.\n\nChicago's changing racial demographics had a profound impact on Chicago Lawn. In the 1960s many of the white Americans had fled Englewood & West Englewood and Chicago Lawn became a target for civil rights groups' open housing marches during the Civil Rights Movement. In 1966, a march led by Martin Luther King, Jr., into Marquette Park met a violent reaction. King himself was hit by a rock. Violence also erupted in the neighborhood when Gage Park High School attempted to integrate after \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954). The primary resistance to integration came from fear of declining property values by people who put their life savings into their homes and disruption of ethnic bonds, especially for the Lithuanians. Despite that, the 1990 Census still showed Non-Hispanic whites as the largest demographic group by race comprising 43% of the population.\n\nHowever, over the next decade the racial composition of the neighborhood changed radically and by the 2000 Census African Americans had become the largest racial group comprising 53% of the population, with Hispanic and Non-Hispanic whites groups accounting for 35% and 10% respectively. There are also black Jewish and Palestinian communities in the neighborhood. Some Irish, Poles, and Lithuanians still remain too, although most have moved further south and west. Many of the Lithuanians and Poles have reestablished their communities in Lemont.\n\nBy the 1920s Arabs immigrated to Chicago, and political turmoil in the decades following the 1948 creation of Israel brought more Palestinian Muslims to Chicago. Arab families live in Chicago Lawn and Gage Park Neighborhoods. Arab community founded Chicago Islamic Center and Mosque on 63rd. Many Middle Eastern store and restaurant near Mosque area. Arab families come from Palestine, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. In the 1950s, Palestinians with families moved out of their boardinghouses and shops and into apartments and homes just west of Chicago's \"Black Belt.\" By the 1970s, they formed a concentrated residential community in Gage Park and Chicago Lawn, on the South Side, and had established a business district with stores catering to Arab clientele.\n\nChicago's largest concentration of Palestinians still lives in these areas and in the communities to the south and west of them. In the 1980s, many upwardly mobile Palestinian families moved to the southwest suburbs, bringing significant Palestinian and Arab populations to Bridgeview, Alsip, Oak Lawn, Hickory Hills, Palos Hills. Alsalm Mosque Foundation is small place to worship, Palestinians built new Mosque Foundation in 1982 in Bridgeview.\n\nChicago Public Schools operates public schools in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Chicago Public Library Chicago Lawn Branch, dedicated on December 1, 1960, serves the community.\n\nThe Chicago Lawn community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, the Chicago Lawn cast 13,959 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 609 votes for Donald Trump (93.87% to 4.10%). In the 2012 presidential election, Chicago Lawn cast 15,171 votes for Barack Obama and cast 682 votes for Mitt Romney (95.24% to 4.28%).\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Street was often accompanied to the ring by his long-time manager and wife Miss Linda, and the two worked primarily as villains.\n\nBorn in Brynmawr in Brecknockshire, Street's family was in the coal mining business – his father was a miner for 51 years. In his teenage years, he began bodybuilding. He left home at age 16 and began his professional wrestling career in 1957. His early inspirations were American wrestlers Lou Thesz, Buddy Rogers and Don Leo Jonathan (from whom Street adopted his first moniker, Kid Tarzan Jonathan).\n\nStreet was trained as a professional wrestler by Chic Osmond and Mike Demitre. His first professional wrestling match was on 8 August 1957. Using the name Kid Tarzan Jonathan, Street defeated Geoff Moran.\n\nLater in his career, he developed his \"Exotic\" Adrian Street image, an outrageously-attired, effeminate character who was hinted but never outright-stated to be gay. Street has explained that this gimmick was born by accident as a result of him playing up to taunting from an audience one evening, commenting \"I was getting far more reaction than I'd ever got just playing this poof. My costumes started getting wilder\". His wrestling attire evolved to including pastels and glitter make up and clipping his bleached hair into mini-pigtails. As \"The Exotic One\" his signature move in the ring was to kiss opponents to escape being pinned down and to put make up on his opponents when they were disabled. He also sang several glam rock songs, such as \"Sweet Transvestite With A Broken Nose\" and \"Imagine What I Could Do To You\"; the latter being his entrance music.\n\nWorking primarily as a heel, Street travelled all over the world including wrestling in Germany, Canada and Mexico. In the UK, he formed a tag partnership with fellow heel Bobby Barnes named the Hells Angels. In 1969 Street met his future manager/valet and real-life wife Miss Linda (Linda Gunthorpe Hawker). During the 1970s, Linda wrestled in Britain as Blackfoot Sue. Later in America, the two formed a double-act, Miss Linda becoming one of professional wrestling's first female valets and frequently participating as an accomplice to Street's in-ring shenanigans.\n\nStreet and Linda appeared in various areas in the independent wrestling circuit in North America, and finally settled in Ron Fuller's Continental Championship Wrestling (CCW) in Birmingham, Alabama in 1985. He worked early on as a heel against Austin Idol, Wendall Cooley and Norvell Austin before turning face in 1986. Street was so convincing as a heel that fans stood in shock as Street saved Bob Armstrong, under a mask as the Bullet, from an attack by Robert Fuller, Jimmy Golden and Tom Prichard. Street had a long feud there with \"The Hustler,\" Rip Rogers. He returned to the area shortly before it closed in summer, 1989, teaming with Bill Dundee and Todd Morton against \"RPM\" Mike Davis and a young Masahiro Chono, as well as a feud against Terry Garvin (Terry Sims) and his partner, Marc Guleen, known as Beauty and the Beast.\n\nAfter retiring from full-time in-ring work, Street ran the Skull Krushers Wrestling School in Gulf Breeze, Florida, until being forced to close doors following severe damage from Hurricane Ivan. Street and Linda also went into business designing and selling professional wrestling gear and other sundries via their website. He created the ring gear worn by Mick Foley as Dude Love during his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n\nIn 2005, Street appeared at WrestleReunion in a battle royal for the IWA Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Greg Valentine. That same year, he began wrestling for NWA Wrestle Birmingham, where he actively wrestled until the promotion ceased operations in 2014.\n\nAfter his last match on June 14, 2014, in Birmingham Alabama, Street estimated that during his career he had wrestled between 12,000 and 15,000 matches.\n\nAdrian has released seven autobiographical books through CreateSpace.\n\n\nStreet starred alongside Ron Perlman in the 1981 film \"Quest for Fire\". He also appeared in \"Grunt: The Wrestling Movie\" (1985), as well as appearing in the opening scenes of Pasolini's 1972 film \"The Canterbury Tales\" as a wrestler.\n\nStreet and his band, The Pile Drivers, released the LP \"Shake, Wrestle and Roll\" in 1986. It compiled two earlier singles (from 1977 and 1980) with a selection of new songs.\n\nA photo of Street in full regalia posing at the mine his father worked at features as the front cover of Black Box Recorder's debut album \"England Made Me\".\n\nA documentary titled \"Changing Perceptions: Profile of an Openly Gay Pro Wrestler\" produced in 2006 features an interview with Adrian Street in addition to the film's main subject, pro wrestler Simon Sermon. The film was produced by award-winning filmmaker Victor Rook.\n\nStreet is the subject of a documentary by visual artist Jeremy Deller, entitled \"The Life and Times of Adrian Street\".\n\nA biographical feature film drama on Street's inspirational life story is currently being made by film producer and director Joann Randles with the working title \"Adrian\".\n\nJon Langford's Men of Gwent have written a tribute song called \"Adrian Street\".\n\nStreet's life story became an episode of the podcast Love and Radio in August 2018.\n\nIn 2005, Street proposed to long-time manager Miss Linda at a reunion of the Cauliflower Alley Club.

{"id": "1892244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892244", "title": "West Englewood, Chicago", "text": "West Englewood, Chicago\n\nWest Englewood, one of the 77 community areas, is on the southwest side of Chicago, Illinois. At one time it was known as South Lynne. The boundaries of West Englewood are Garfield Blvd to the north, Racine Ave to the east, the CSX and Norfolk Southern RR tracks to the west, and the Belt Railway of Chicago to the south. Though it is a separate community area, much of the history and culture of the neighborhood is linked directly to the Englewood neighborhood.\n\nThe first European settlers to the area that developed as West Englewood were predominantly German and Swedish farmers who arrived in the 1840s. After construction of rail lines for the Rock Island and Wabash Railroads, the area became known as Chicago Junction, which soon changed to Junction Grove. This is commemorated today with the Junction Grove Playlot Park, which is maintained by the Chicago Park District. By 1865, Junction Grove became the unincorporated town of Lake, which was later renamed Englewood.\n\nTwo events led to population increases for the Englewood and West Englewood neighorhoods. In 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed many neighborhoods to the north. The combination of open spaces for housing and the presence of railroad lines made these neighborhoods ideal for Chicagoans looking for less crowding and moving from the urban center destroyed in the fire. In 1889 the neighborhoods of Englewood and West Englewood became part of the City of Chicago after the town of Lake was annexed by the city.\n\nWith annexation came Chicago street cars, the second factor to encourage development. In 1903 the Englewood Elevated Railway Company built a branch running roughly along 63rd Street to Loomis, which was connected to the South Side Elevated Railroad. These improvements in transportation made the Englewood area an easy commute for workers traveling north to the stockyards, a major employer, and downtown.\n\nAt the same time that hundreds of thousands of European immigrants were coming to Chicago, where unskilled labor jobs in the stockyards and steelmills enabled them to support families, blacks from the rural South started migrating to the industrial city. Beginning during World War I, when they replaced workers who were drafted, blacks migrated to the city in great number before 1940. They were escaping oppressive social and political conditions: a high rate of lynchings, disfranchisement across the South that prevented them from voting, segregated education in underfunded systems, and legal racial segregation. Initially, they competed with immigrants primarily for unskilled jobs and housing; blacks were restricted by discrimination in housing practices to narrow areas of older housing on the South Side, known as the Black Belt.\n\nEuropean immigrants and ethnic whites dominated separate territories on the South Side: the Irish, Polish, Italians and others had their own centers of population which they protected against each other and against blacks. According to statistics compiled by the \"Encyclopedia of Chicago,\" the West Englewood area had 63,845 residents in 1930, 98% of whom were white and almost 23% foreign born. It reached its peak population in 1940, with more than 64,000 residents.\n\nIndustrial restructuring after World War II led to the massive loss of jobs that residents had depended on: the stockyard operations were moved west, first to Kansas City, Kansas, and eventually the good-paying jobs in the steelmills also shifted out of the region. Railroads also restructured, causing more loss of union jobs among both whites and African Americans.\n\nIn 1960 the median income was close to the Chicago median income, $6,738 ($ adjusted for inflation), and 12% of the residents were black.\n\nDuring the 1960s and after, advances in civil rights opened more areas of housing to blacks, and they followed other Americans into the further reaches of the city, settling in West Englewood and other southern neighborhoods. The changes in industry, however, meant that skilled workers could no longer achieve middle-class lives. Although union jobs were no longer racially restricted, fewer were to be had. Many workers left the area to seek employment, and neighborhoods declined in population and services. Other residents moved further out into suburban towns to seek newer housing.\n\nBy 2000 due to the loss of jobs, the population of West Englewood had dropped to 45,282. By that time, with demographic changes, 98% of residents were black. According to the 2000 census, only 1% of the population was foreign born. Late 20th-century immigrants have been primarily from Latin America and Asia, and have created concentrated settlements in other neighborhoods.\n\nThe headquarters for the Chicago Police Department's 7th district are located in West Englewood.\n\nChicago Public Schools:\n\nChicago Public Library:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1892262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892262", "title": "Leverett House", "text": "Leverett House\n\nLeverett House is one of twelve undergraduate residential Houses at Harvard University. It is situated along the north bank of the Charles River in Cambridge and consists of McKinlock Hall, constructed in 1925; two 12-story towers completed in 1960; and two floors of 20 DeWolfe Street, a building Leverett shares with two other houses at Harvard. It has the largest student population within the Harvard house system.\n\n The bulk of McKinlock Hall consists of 5 entryways (labeled A through E), each of which leads to four or five floors of suites for approximately 35 students. McKinlock houses the Leverett Dining Hall, the Junior and Senior Common Rooms, the Old Library Theatre, the Faculty Dean's Residence, and several other common spaces.\n\nThe Leverett Towers (commonly referred to as F- and G-Tower, corresponding to their respective entryway labels) serve a primarily residential function. Each tower consists primarily of singles and doubles and holds approximately 150 students. The top floors of the towers - especially those facing south - boast outstanding views of the Boston skyline and the Charles River. The ground floor of G-Tower features a common area that house residents have nicknamed the \"G-spot,\" although the space goes largely unused due to its poor design. The ground floor of F-tower includes a common area similar to the one found in G-Tower, as well as several offices belonging to the Allston Burr Resident Dean and House Administrator. Between the towers and McKinlock sits the Leverett Library, which was constructed along with the towers and has won awards for its innovative design. The ground floor of the library building houses the building manager's office.\n\nThe top floors of 20 DeWolfe Street were annexed by the house in fall of 2007. Originally intended for faculty or graduate students, the DeWolfe suites are smaller apartment-style units with more modern amenities than those available in either McKinlock or Leverett Towers.\n\nLeverett House was named after John Leverett (whose grandfather, John Leverett had been the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony), who was President of Harvard from 1708 to 1724. Leverett's election was one of the significant turning points for Harvard, for every President before him had been a clergyman. Leverett was a leader of the liberal movement in the Congregational Church and he opposed the powerful clergymen Increase and Cotton Mather, who had attempted to impose upon the College a new charter containing a loyalty oath that would have refused appointment to the faculty of anyone not willing to acknowledge the primacy of Biblical scripture. Leverett, during his tenure as president, improved the quality of instruction in the College, and maintained the position of Harvard in the critical years when Yale was becoming a formidable rival.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Harvard constructed student residences on the banks of the recently dammed Charles River. These residences were initially occupied by freshmen. McKinlock Hall, built in 1925, was one of those original buildings. The building was donated by the family of Lieutenant George Alexander McKinlock Jr, a Harvard graduate who was killed by a German machine gun near Soissons in 1918.\n\nWith the formation of Leverett House in 1930-31, Mather Hall, across Mill Street, was built along with the present dining hall and Master's residence. Six squash courts were also constructed, adjacent to Mather Hall. Leverett remained in that configuration until the early 1960s, when the College expanded and new Houses were added. Mather Hall became a part of Quincy House, the squash courts were lost, and the Leverett Towers were built. The Saltonstall family gave money for a new library in honor of the ten generations of Saltonstalls who had attended Harvard, and the House offices moved to the first floor of F-Tower. Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson and Abbott designed the two-story library, as well as the two twelve-story Leverett Towers that were constructed at the same time. In 1983, McKinlock was renovated, and at that time a new entrance to the dining hall was constructed.\n\nThe first Master of the House was Kenneth Murdock, Professor of English and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe second Master was Leigh Hoadley, an embryologist and professor of zoology. Hoadley resigned in 1957, shortly before Leverett was to be renovated.\n\nThe third Master was John J. Conway, a scholar of Canadian history. He married his wife Jill, who was a graduate student in Harvard's history department at the time, in the early 1960s.\n\nThe fourth Master was Richard T. Gill, an economist. A bass singer, Gill sang each year in the Leverett House Opera, which was a fixture in the House. While Master, he auditioned for the New York City Opera and was offered a contract. He accepted and left Harvard, economics, and Leverett to begin a new career, first with the New York City Opera, and later with the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nThe fifth Co-Masters, Kenneth Andrews and Carolyn Andrews, were appointed in 1971. During their tenure, the Houses became coeducational. Andrews was a professor at Harvard Business School and the first Business School faculty member to be appointed Master. During Harvard's 350th anniversary celebration in 1986, Andrews was one of 20 individuals who received a Harvard Medal for distinguished service to the University. His citation read: \"He understands, as Mark Twain never did, how business works best; his writings elucidate the complex subject to the benefit of his Harvard colleagues and of managers everywhere.\"\n\nRenowned biologist John E. Dowling and his wife Judith were appointed as the sixth Co-Masters of Leverett House in 1981 and served until 1998.\n\nThe seventh Faculty Deans, Howard Georgi and his wife Ann, were appointed in 1998 and served until 2018. Howard and Ann, more commonly known as Chief and Coach respectively, are beloved for their house pride, their dogs, and monkey bread, a delicious cinnamon-flavored treat popular among Leverett students.\n\nBrian D. Farrell and Irina Ferreras were appointed as the eighth Faculty Deans in 2018. Farrell is a professor of biology and curator of entomology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Ferreras is a curatorial assistant at the Harvard University Herbaria. In their first year as Faculty Deans, they have supported the appreciation of art and nature by inviting Brazilian artist to exhibit his works and by hosting nature walks for students.\n\nNotable alumni of Leverett House include Aga Khan IV, Colin Jost, Timothy Crouse, Andrew Glaze, Al Jean, Anthony Lake, Steven Levitt, Jeremy Lin, Saul Perlmutter, Mike Reiss, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Sydney Schanberg, Pete Seeger, Laurence Tribe, John Weidman, Cornel West, and Pete Buttigieg. Yo-Yo Ma was a music tutor for the house. Archibald MacLeish, Perry Miller, and Lillian Hellman lived on the top of F-Tower. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, both cabinet officials in the Obama Administration, also resided in Leverett during their times at Harvard.\n\nThe House Shield is a derivative of the ancient Leverett family crest depicting three hares rampant with an inverted chevron. The family name is derived from the word \"leveret\" (with one \"t\"), which means young hare; family tradition has it that the earliest recorded family members were keepers of ferrets, which were trained to chase rabbits from their burrows. The official house colors are black and yellow, appearing on the earliest House paraphernalia that can be found. However, the combinations of black and red as well as green and yellow are often used. Annual T-shirt designs usually feature some combination of those four colors. Leverett House has a sister house at Yale, Timothy Dwight College.\n\n"}
{"id": "1892272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892272", "title": "Hellgate: London", "text": "Hellgate: London\n\nHellgate: London is a dark fantasy themed action role-playing game originally developed by Flagship Studios, released on October 31, 2007. It was developed by a team led by former Blizzard Entertainment employees, some of whom had overseen the creation of the \"Diablo\" series.\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic London in the year 2038, \"Hellgate: London\" is a fast-paced action role-playing hack and slash game. It includes random elements from roguelikes such as weapon and armour attributes, item drops, mob spawns and level composition. The game featured both single-player and online multiplayer support when it was released although North American and European (US/EU) online support has since shutdown. The single-player version features a five act story quest line when completed, the player is eligible to restart the story line again in a new high difficulty and create new characters in an elite mode.\n\nIn 2008, Flagship Studios filed bankruptcy and all intellectual property was seized as collateral for funding received from Comerica Bank. Subsequently, development of the game halted. Namco Bandai Games provided free ongoing US/EU server support in the fall of Flagship Studios until January 31, 2009, when the US/EU multiplayer game servers and websites were taken offline. HanbitSoft has since acquired properties to the game and has redeveloped it as a free-to-play Hellgate London: Resurrection in South Korea, featuring Seoul based maps. In 2014, Hellgate Global was announced to add Tokyo to the game for a possible release outside South Korea.\n\n\"Hellgate: London\" is an action role-playing game that builds upon the core design of roguelikes by using random generation of maps, monsters, and loot to allow for replayability. The game can be played in either third person perspective or first person perspective.\n\n\"Hellgate: London\" can be played offline or online without a fee. Players can pay a monthly fee to gain additional content over time, including new areas, weapons, monsters, classes, quests, events, titles, game modes and other content. The game consists of six acts to unify the areas a player travels through on a greater scale. All acts account for approximately 25–40 hours of single-player gameplay.\n\n\"Hellgate: London\" was initially designed to be primarily focused on solo and cooperative PvE combat, but players can duel and there is a free-for-all PvP mode for subscribers. Dueling can only take place outside of Underground hubs. Players can also choose to enter into PvP mode, which means they can be attacked and harmed outside of Underground hubs by anyone else that has chosen to enter PvP mode. The game does not feature LAN support.\n\nThe game world of \"Hellgate: London\" is a set of demon-infested dungeons and city streets, featuring safe zones such as disused London Underground stations. The safe zones scattered across the world act as havens, where players can purchase and upgrade items at NPC merchants, interact with other players in the game world, and commence or complete quests. The journey between zones is randomly generated; levels are fully 3D, rendered with the game's own proprietary graphics engine. Included in these environments are randomly generated enemies, bosses and items. The game features historical London areas and buildings, such as St Paul's Cathedral and Big Ben.\n\nThe \"Hellgate: London\" setting has six classes to choose from. These are paired up into three main archetypes, referred to as Factions in game. Players need to choose one of these classes for their role playing character before they can start playing the game. The factions are split as follows;\n\nMelee classes are set to a third-person view and cannot select first-person perspective, whereas ranged classes default to a first-person view but can switch to third-person if so desired. Precision aiming is not required to use most weapons; which track their targets, \"lock-on\", or carpet an area with explosives. The game contains sniper rifles and other weapons that require accurate manual aiming, though most are exclusive to the Hunter faction.\n\nPlayers may choose the character's name, and various visual physical attributes. Depending on whether playing singleplayer or multiplayer, several different difficulty settings will be available when creating new characters. A character is permanently locked to the chosen mode. Normal mode is the default difficulty setting. Elite mode is designed to be harder than normal difficulty with several adjustments to game mechanics. Enemies are stronger, deal more damage and rare/legendary mobs are more likely to spawn. Augments are also more expensive and merchants pay less for goods. Hardcore mode is played in either Normal or Elite difficulty with the added attribute a character permanently dies and turns into a ghost when all health is lost.\n\n\"Hellgate: London\" uses a heavily randomized item system of at least a hundred base weapon types and many armor types, with a pool of random special properties and bonuses (magical affixes) applied to them to achieve re-playability and promote item collection. Furthermore, unwanted weapons and armour can be freely disassembled to save space in one's inventory, often yielding standard or rare crafting materials that can be exchanged for special crafted weapons at an NPC vendor, or used to upgrade existing weapons or armour. Items may have slots that a player can insert \"mods\" in to enhance their power.\n\nThe single-player version of \"Hellgate: London\" hosts the five-act story quest line. Elite characters can be created once a character has completed the story quest line once. The story line can be repeated in Nightmare difficulty starting with mobs starting at level 30. A character's experience is capped at 50 levels while enemies in Nightmare difficulty can reach level 62\n\nThe developer Flagship Studios had proposed regular additions to \"Hellgate: London\" throughout the life of the game. In March 2008, it was announced that Comerica Bank would provide game funding assistance, using \"Hellgate: London\" as collateral, for Flagship Studios so that they would not \"rely upon a publisher's investment\" to support ongoing development of their games. \"The Stonehenge Chronicles\" update was scheduled for release on January 21, 2008 but was postponed until January 22, 2008 due to bugs. The last content patch developed by Flagship Studios was the \"Abyss Chronicles\". The original servers were shut down on February 1, 2009.\n\nThe company Ping0 managed the American (US) and European (EU) regional servers for \"Hellgate: London\" while Infocomm Asian Holdings managed the South-East Asia (SEA) regional server along with the game support and user forums for SEA region players. Players who purchased the game in SEA had server crashing issues; the publishing companies involved gave an official response after several requests from the community to do so. Following the shut down of Flagship Studios in August 2008 and the loss of the intellectual property rights, it was announced that \"Hellgate: London\" game servers would be shut down as of January 31, 2009. As announced at 12:00am February 1, 2009 CST the game server for the North American and European regions became inaccessible and the website for \"Hellgate: London\" also went offline.\n\nThe following is an account of the US/EU subscription model Flagship Studios had while it was in effect: There were two types of multiplayer accounts: free and subscription accounts. Subscribers had access to ongoing content updates. The US subscription plan cost $9.95 a month and an offer to pay a one-time fee of $149.99 for a lifetime subscription was available for up to 100,000 people who pre-ordered the game and ended on January 31, 2008. The UK subscription is £6.99 and EU subscription is €9.99. Additionally, subscribers would have access to a Hardcore mode, special PvP arenas and a PvP ladder, the ability to bypass server queues, a shared storage space with room for 40 items instead of 20, the ability to create guilds, the ability to achieve officer status in guilds, and 24-hour customer support. Subscribers and non-subscribers were able to interact in all ways in the game. Non-subscribers could join guilds, but not create them. The level cap is set to 50 and up to 24 character slots are available for all players. As of July 2008, all subscriptions were suspended and players could neither subscribe nor unsubscribe at that point, although they were no longer billed. Since Flagship Studios went into receivership, the US & EU multiplayer ceased.\n\nDue to problems with the subscription service, the Halloween holiday subscription content was made available to all players, both fee-paying and free-playing. In SEA, two weeks after the game was released, many players complained about a game patch, installed by Infocomm Asia Holdings (IAH), which supposedly would have deleted player's characters since game launch. While the EU and US servers had received recent patches and additional content since launch, support and patching of the SEA server had been delayed. IAHGames, the distributor of \"Hellgate: London\" and the company providing the \"Alliance\" server for the SEA region, had promised patch 0 on launch day itself. However, Patch 0 was delayed with no official date of implementation. On November 14, a joint statement by the CEOs of IAHGames and Flagship Studios announced that the both Patch 0 and Patch 0.1 will be implemented on November 22 and that they are considering some compensation for the early adopters.\n\nOn November 3, 2008, Korean-based software distributor Hanbitsoft announced via its global public relations blog, that it has acquired the \"Hellgate: London\" and \"Mythos\" properties from Flagship Studios. The post mentions development of an upcoming expansion, using leftover Flagship development efforts. Updates from company state the expansion pack includes new maps featuring Seoul and a product title, \"The Second Invasion\". On November 12, 2009, HanbitSoft announced the re-development of \"Hellgate: London\" (authorized by the former Flagship Studio) had been completed. By July 2011, \"Hellgate: London\" multiplayer servers were relaunched using a free-to-play model. Hanbitsoft's redesigned game is live in Korea, while the North American release has been only in beta testing.\n\nIn September 2014, \"Hellgate Global\", which was announced to include the expansion \"Hellgate: Tokyo\" and the new Hell Mode difficulty level, was listed at Steam Greenlight by HanbitSoft-linked company Redbana Corporation. The project was approved by the Steam Community and Valve contacted Redbana Corporation for the possibility of hosting the game on Steam. However, in January 2016 the T3Fun/Redbana Hellgate Global service was shut down.\n\nOn November 15, 2018, Hellgate: London was released on Steam, developed by T3 Entertainment and published by HanbitSoft.\n\nThe game received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game sold almost one million copies.\n\nPositive aspects of the game commented on by reviewers include its story, and the overall look of the game. Other aspects of the game received mixed reception. For instance, some reviewers called the combat enjoyable, with varied classes, and praised the loot and customisation aspects, while other reviewers described combat as underdeveloped and monotonous, with quest repetition and locked progression choices. Similarly, the game's technology received mixed reviews. The multiplayer component was both praised and criticised, with some bugs, slowdowns and crashes mentioned. \n\nA comic book adaptation of \"Hellgate: London\" was written by Ian Edginton, illustrated by Steve Pugh, and published by Dark Horse Comics. All four issues were collected into a trade paperback published in June 2007 (). The collected comic was also included in the Collector's Edition of the game. The plot focuses on a Templar, Cabalist and Hunter teaming together to rescue a book they believe will give them an advantage over the demons.\n\nThere is also a trilogy of novels based on \"Hellgate: London\" written by Mel Odom. The first novel, titled \"Exodus\" was released on June 26, 2007; the second novel, \"Goetia\", was released on February 26, 2008; the third novel, \"Covenant\" was released on August 26, 2008. \"Exodus\" is set 18 years before events of the game, \"Goetia\" takes place 14 years before the events of the game, and \"Covenant\" takes place 13 years before the events of the game. The novels primarily follow the stories of three characters and their interactions with each other, as well as their individual struggles against the demons. Each character is from a different class from the game. The novels also feature references to and cameos by various characters from the game.\n\n\"Hellgate VR\" is being developed by Skonec Entertainment.\n\n"}
{"id": "1892273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892273", "title": "Matthew 2:4", "text": "Matthew 2:4\n\nMatthew 2:4 is the fourth verse of the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. The magi have informed King Herod that they had seen portents showing the birth of the King of the Jews. In this verse he calls together leading figures of Jerusalem to find out where Jesus was to be born.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:4.\n\nMost scholars take the reference to \"all the chief priests and scribes\" as referring to the Sanhedrin, the council of leading religious figures that played an important role in governing. Some have argued that the phrase \"all the chief priests\" is incorrect as there was only one chief priest at the time. Brown notes that this phrase occurs in other contemporary documents and refers to the leading priests and also the former chief priests.\n\nA more important difficulty with this passage is its historical implausibility. Records from that period show that Herod and the Sanhedrin were sharply divided and their relations acrimonious. Schweizer states that Herod calling and consulting with the council is \"historically almost inconceivable.\" Schweizer believes that the introduction of the Jewish leaders is simply a device so that there will be someone to quote the Old Testament passage that appears in . As with the wording of the previous verse many scholars also see this linking of the Jewish leaders and Herod as an example of Christian anti-Semitism. Gundry agrees that the verse is politically motivated and a deliberate foreshadowing of the persecution of Jesus and his church by the leaders of Jerusalem. He notes that at the time the priest were largely Sadducees while the scribes were mostly Pharisees. Thus the specific mentioning of the two groups might be a deliberate attempt to tar both leading Jewish factions.\n\nAlso notable about this verse is that King Herod, who has only heard that the King of the Jews had been born, asks about the Christ, or the messiah.\n\nThat the magi, who first noted the star, do not know and are not even asked about where the messiah might be born is a sign that they are ignorant of Jewish scripture. This is evidence to Brown that they are Gentiles, which is also supported by verse 12's suggestion that they were foreigners: \"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.\" John Chrysostom believed that they were from Persia.\n"}
{"id": "1892274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892274", "title": "Fantasy wrestling", "text": "Fantasy wrestling\n\nFantasy wrestling is an umbrella term representing the genre of role-playing and statistics-based games which are set in the world of professional wrestling. Several variants of fantasy wrestling exist which may be differentiated by the way they are transmitted (through websites, message boards, e-mail, postal mail, face-to-face, etc.), the method in which the storyline is determined, (via roleplay, \"angles\", strategy- or statistics-based systems, etc.) and how the roster is composed (are characters created by the players, are real wrestlers \"imported\" into the game, etc.).\n\nFantasy wrestling's roots lie in the play-by-mail wrestling games often featured in professional wrestling magazines that became prominent in the mid-to-late 1980s during one of professional wrestling's boom periods. By the late 1980s, fantasy wrestling games had started to appear on the Internet. In the early 1990s, the advent of national bulletin board services like Prodigy, AOL, and Compuserve allowed players to use e-mail and bulletin boards to more easily trade information and post roleplays. As technology progressed and the internet evolved, fantasy wrestling enthusiasts took advantage, using websites and newsgroups to connect and build broader communities for gameplay.\n\nIn order to begin fantasy wrestling, one must create a custom character. Some people will elect to use pro-wrestlers over their own, custom characters; this can be either allowed or rejected by the administrator of the federation. Usually, one will decide the following: physical appearance (height, weight, sex; these can be copied through \"renders\" - images of pro-wrestlers - or through their imagination/CAW mechanics through wrestling games), moveset (style, signature moves, finishing moves, etc.), fan reaction (heel or face; booed or cheered), and entrance music. Once this is all decided, the character is named and the player can begin to promo in the federation. Some players create multiple characters, either for choice for playing or to freshen the experience/start new.\n\nEarly versions of the game began in the 1980s using play-by-mail formats. Based on the moves and any strategies applied the adjudicator would then decide the outcome. Play-by-mail leagues often included a 'pay to play' model where handlers paid a fee per match and/or 'strategy' applied. The later expansion into email was a natural progression, often using the same mechanics as the pbm format.\n\nIn the late 1980s, e-wrestling got started on the Internet, played by email and often advertised via Usenet, including rec.games.pbm and rec.games.frp. The early games followed the model of a simplified role-playing game with \"combat systems\" of varying complexity, resolved by the Federation Head, or \"Fedhead.\" The role-playing aspect was significant and the fast turn-around of email allowed for collaboration in the creation of \"promos\" and the formation of tag-teams and \"stables\" made up of multiple players. The term e-wrestling was coined about this time, probably by Scott Baxter, since there were enough federations active to require a collective noun. By 1989, there was enough activity for a dedicated Usenet group, rec.sports.pro-wrestling.fantasy, to be created.\n\nEmail play persisted, as was still common enough in 1995 to rate the occasional mention in annual reviews, although not always favourably.\n\nFantasy wrestling expanded in the early 1990s with the rise of nationwide message boards based on PRODIGY, AOL and Compuserve. Originally connected to message boards focused on professional and amateur wrestling, fantasy wrestling's popularity caused specific subforums to be created on PRODIGY's Wrestling BB and AOL's Grandstand. The games based on the online boards had some differences from the federations operating on the Internet via email and Usenet. Many stat-based systems found ways to integrate roleplay as a factor into determining match winners, paralleling similar developments in some of the Internet email federations. Eventually, roleplay became the primary factor for many leagues.\n\nAs the previously isolated message board services began to connect to the Internet, the disparate communities began to overlap, and much of the activity began to migrate to the World Wide Web. The use of roleplay and promos became a larger factor in the operation of many leagues and determining results.\n\nThe first websites featuring fantasy wrestling began to pop up as the World Wide Web started to develop. An early example was \"The Wild World of e-Wrestling,\" which was devoted to the Internet-based games, and “FW Central,” a site devoted to the PRODIGY-based fantasy wrestling community based on PRODIGY. These sites offered new places for players to interact and expand the hobby, providing online news and resources.\n\nAs the web matured, so did sites devoted to the hobby. The various federations, which had been exclusively text-based, or nearly so, began to integrate Poser images of created wrestlers, animated videos, audio shows, and vlogs.\n\nFantasy wrestling continues to evolve. Traditionally, most roleplays (referred to as \"promos\") revolved around more traditional pro-wrestling topics, focused on trash talking an opponent and hyping an upcoming match, although extensive storylines existed, and gag advertising was fairly common. Longer form roleplay has continued to gain in popularity, resulting in detailed stories and arcs.\n\nHowever, roleplay is not the only form of fantasy wrestling currently available. There are also federations based around angles and booking, there are turn-based sites that allow you and an opponent to alternate between different parts of the match until a moderator decides who wins. Another niche is match-writing federations. Seen as one of the more challenging types, match-writing federations require you to write your match against your opponents and the winner's match is seen as canon. Stat or dice based federations continue to thrive, as well, sometimes deliberately harkening back to the earlier days of the hobby.\n\nAnother method of fantasy wrestling currently used is called \"E-Fedding\" (a slang term for E-Federations, internet groups that identify as fictional companies). Individuals roleplay with promos, written similar to a screenplay of a movie, and the moderators/administrators of the forum/group decide the winner(s) based on the promos written, storylines in play/building, along with other factors that may present themselves. On Facebook, several E-Federations can be found; such as Extreme Wrestling Generations.\n\nSome players have created social media accounts now to live out the lives of their characters in ways a typical roleplay could not show.\n\nIn the now shutdown social media website Google+, users would create communities for Fantasy Wrestling role-play. Often, these communities involved the community members voting for who they deemed winner of the fantasy matches. The members of the community would choose the victor based on which participant in the match made the better promo in their opinions. These wrestling role-play communities became very popular among wrestling fans on Google+. With the biggest community, named World Wrestling Role-play (WWR), having over 800 members.\n\nIn 2004, World Wrestling Entertainment began its own fantasy wrestling game focused on selecting WWE Superstars as part of a team and receiving points based on their involvement on the WWE television shows. WWE singled out \"real wrestling\" E-Feds who used the names and likenesses of WWE Superstars and began sending them cease-and-desist letters. WWE later disbanded its fantasy wrestling game.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling also operated their own fantasy wrestling game. The game operated from the promotion's message boards and was based on real wrestlers. The game never gained notoriety and was removed along with the message boards from the promotion's website in late 2006. In June 2011, TNA relaunched their fantasy wrestling game as a part of their Impact Wrestling campaign.\n"}

Thomas and Roselli are billed as being popular \"with the ladies\", and typically approach the ring while performing pelvic thrusts to the accompaniment of dance music. They are perhaps best known for their appearances with World Wrestling Entertainment on Raw brand.\n\nIn 2003, Johnny Heartbreaker and Antonio Thomas formed a tag team in the Eastern Wrestling Alliance called \"The Heart Breakers\". On January 23, 2004, in Southbridge, Massachusetts, they defeated Cueball and Nick McKenna to win the EWA Tag Team Championship. The Heart Breakers lost the titles to Clinically Inclined (Andre Lyonz and Dr. Heresy) on June 18.\n\nThomas and Heartbreaker, now going by Romeo Roselli, joined World Wrestling Entertainment's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling in 2004, though Roselli wasn't officially signed to a WWE developmental contract until February 2005.\n\nRenamed \"The Heart Throbs\" and going simply by Antonio and Romeo respectively, they made their WWE debut on the April 18, 2005 episode of \"Raw\", losing to World Tag Team Champions William Regal and Tajiri. They participated in a tag-team turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship at Backlash 2005, but were defeated once again.\n\nThe Heart Throbs mainly appeared on the \"Raw\" B-show, \"Heat\". They had short-lived feuds with Eugene and William Regal, The Hurricane and Rosey, and Val Venis and Viscera. In 2006, the Heart Throbs gained a great deal of fan reaction and began entertaining the crowd by bringing two \"hot chicks\" into the ring and getting them to dance. During a \"WWE Unlimited\" webcast the Heart Throbs were sitting with the fans and they ended up being on its \"Kiss Cam\" segment, each kissing a girl sitting near them.\n\nBoth Thomas and Roselli were released by WWE on February 10, 2006.\n\nSince their release, they have been active on the independent wrestling scene. They have spent time teaming together, as well as in solo competition, where each has a victory over the other, and two matches that were declared no contests. Together they have beaten such teams as The West Hollywood Blondes and Sex and Violence. They also wrestled former NWA World Tag Team Champions The Naturals, as well as 1-2-3 Kid and Marty Jannetty, and have even teamed with the Young Bucks in an 8-man tag team match. They lost to The Spirit Squad on January 17, 2015 XWA Extreme Rumble.\n\nRoselli and Thomas were backstage at Final Resolution 2007, and wrestled the Riggs Brothers at the January 29, 2007 TNA television tapings. At Destination X 2007 on March 11, 2007, Roselli and Thomas, identified as \"The Heartbreakers\", appeared as a tag team selected by villainous manager Christy Hemme to face the Voodoo Kin Mafia (B.G. and Kip James). The Heartbreakers were defeated by the Voodoo Kin Mafia. They were released months later without ever appearing in TNA again.\n\n\n"}

Originally comprising guitarists Danny Amis (formerly of the Raybeats), Eddie Angel and drummer L. J. \"Jimmy\" Lester under the name The Straitjackets, the band split up soon after forming, but reunited as Los Straitjackets in 1994 with the addition of bassist E. Scott Esbeck. Esbeck left the band in 1998 and was replaced by Pete Curry. The current lineup also features Greg Townson on guitar and Chris Sprague on drums.\n\nThe band has released fourteen studio albums, four collaboration albums and eight live albums.\n\nEddie Angel was a noted rockabilly guitarist who moved to Nashville in the early 1980s to record and perform with the Planet Rockers. Danny Amis recorded and performed with the Raybeats, then worked as a sound engineer in Nashville. The two formed The Straitjackets in 1988 with Jimmy Lester, a Nashville session player who had worked and toured with Robert Gordon. They played several gigs during the summer of that year, but soon broke up.\n\nIn 1994 they reformed as Los Straitjackets, adding bass player Scott Esbeck. Their first album, \"The Utterly Fantastic and Totally Unbelievable Sound of Los Straitjackets\", was released the following year on Upstart Records. In the post-\"Pulp Fiction\" surf revival, the group began attracting a following, though their music is not entirely surf-oriented.\n\nOver the next few years, the band developed a cult following through its tight instrumentation and stage shows. In its live performances, band members dress in identical black suits, gold Aztec medallions, and personalized Mexican wrestling masks. Danny Amis, a fan of Luchador films and Mexican culture had suggested the band wear the masks he had purchased in Mexico at the band's first gig on a whim; the crowd went wild and a tradition was born. Frontman Amis (aka \"Daddy-O Grande\") was the sole spokesperson of the band, and would introduce the songs in fast, heavily accented Spanish.\n\nIn 1998 Esbeck left the band during the recording of \"The Velvet Touch of Los Straitjackets\" and was replaced by Pete Curry, formerly of the Halibuts, a 1980s surf-revival group. In 2005 Lester left and was replaced by Jason \"Teen Beat\" Smay. They have become known as frequent collaborators, recording \"Sing Along with Los Straitjackets\" with a number of different artists. They were nominated for a Grammy Award for their collaboration with blues singer Eddy Clearwater, \"Rock 'N' Roll City\".\n\nTheir stage shows have become more elaborate and frequently feature choreography, guest vocalists such as Eddy \"The Chief\" Clearwater, Kaiser George of the Scottish band the Kaisers, Big Sandy, and the burlesque dancing troupe The World Famous Pontani Sisters. In recent years, they have staged festive Christmas shows during the holiday season.\n\nIn 2010 Danny Amis was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He was sidelined from recording and touring while under treatment. Los Straitjackets recruited guitarist Greg \"Gregorio El Grande\" Townson to fill Amis' role during his absence. In 2012 Amis announced that his cancer was \"under control\" and he would return to recording and limited touring with Los Straitjackets in September 2012. This coincided with the band's new studio release \"Jet Set\" and debut of new drummer Chris \"Sugar Balls\" Sprague. Amis now lives in Mexico City.\n\nIn late 2016, Los Straitjackets were due to embark on a tour with NRBQ. Prior to the tour, Pete Curry had to undergo shoulder replacement surgery. While he was recovering, his replacements consisted of Eddie's son, Max, Todd Bradley of the Hi-Risers, and Juan Ugalde of The Outta Sites.\nOn May 19, 2017, the band released \"What's So Funny About Peace, Love And...\", a tribute to the music of Nick Lowe, on Yep Roc Records. In 2019 the band embarked on a UK tour backing Lowe. Their February 2019 single with Lowe, \"Love Starvation,\" was described by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine as \"a peppy-sounding old-school rock song that paints a bleak lyrical picture of romantic fallout.\" Lowe said of the band: \"Apart from being a fantastic rock ‘n’ roll band, they know how to play tons of different styles really well. They can knock you out a version of Bacharach and David's \"The Look of Love\" with no trouble at all.\"\n\nLos Straitjackets provided some of the music for the independent film \"Psycho Beach Party\", and appeared briefly in the film. They also recorded two albums of music specifically for television and commercial use, and their work is often heard as filler or background music on radio and television shows.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Conan O'Brien had the band perform Christmas music each holiday season on his late-night television program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She graduated from Ladue Horton Watkins High School in 1971. She attended Dartmouth College.\n\nPassanante was in 1980's \"Return of the Secaucus 7\" and 1983's \"Lianna\".\n\nPassanante got her start on soaps working as a staff writer on the ABC Daytime drama \"One Life to Live\" from 1992 to 1996. In 1996 she was promoted to the top position of Head Writer, only to be replaced in 1997. She remained as a staff writer until 1998, at which time she was made Co-Head Writer of the ailing soap opera \"Another World\". Passanante wrapped up the show's 35-year run in June 1999. The next month, she relieved \"All My Children\" creator Agnes Nixon of head writing duties after Nixon was called in to temporarily replace Megan McTavish.\n\nPassanante's contract with \"All My Children\" expired in 2001, and she was replaced by Richard Culliton. She was then hired by CBS' \"As the World Turns\" in 2001, where she served as Co-Head Writer (second in command to Hogan Sheffer) until she was promoted to Head Writer in early 2005; she continued in that role through the show's 2010 cancellation. Following the cancellation of \"As the World Turns\", Passanante returned to \"One Life to Live\" as Associate Head Writer, a role she held until 1998, until its television cancellation in January 2012. From January 25, 2008 through April 17, 2008, ATWT episodes were written by non-union writers due to Passanante and her team participating in the WGA strike.

In July 2015, Passanante and Altman returned to \"General Hospital\" as its co-head writers, replacing Carlivati. On June 6, 2017, Passanante announced her decision to retire from \"General Hospital\", stating: \"It gets to be a time when it’s just time. [...] And it seemed like the right time. I do have other things that I’m interested in pursuing and I have a daughter who lives in Europe, who I want to visit whenever I can. I have been pondering it for a long time. It’s a pretty consuming kind of job and you need to get your head clear of it every once in a while. It’s been a great 27 years, or something like that — it’s a long time!\".

Its popularity has resulted in various adaptations on film and television. To this date there are 4 movies and 1 TV series.\n\nAs this comic book is for a Cantonese audience, the dialogue is in the more vernacular written Cantonese, rather than the standard written Chinese.\n\nThe main characters are two male best friends, Jerry and Hui Lok (許樂), and their female friend, Cherie. The story revolves around their relationships with others, including Jenny and Kei Kei (琪琪), and each other.\n\nOn 26 August 2008, Feel 100% won the Second International Manga Awards. The comic is currently licensed in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Italy, Mainland China and the United Kingdom\n\nThe movies are characterized as being loosely based on the comics. As each film's story line is different, certain characters, including the main ones, may or may not appear in each film. Each film and series stands independent from the others.\n\nThe movies have appeared in the following order:\n\nFeel 100% (1996)\n\nThis film launched the careers of several of its participants, notably director Joe Ma and actress Sammi Cheng. Both have become associated with Gen-X romantic comedies. Other actors appearing include Ekin Cheng and Gigi Leung.\n\nFeel 100% ... Once More (1996)\n\nThis film's only common thread with the series is the title as even the characters have different names. However, the director and all the lead actors from the previous movie remained for this one. And it remained true to the spirit of Feel 100%, which is a Gen-X coming of age story.\n\nFeel 100% II (2001)\n\nOf note is the absence of main character Cherie from this incarnation. Many of the actors in this film went on to appear in the following version, the TV series. They include Daniel Chan (陳曉東), Niki Chow (周麗淇), Miriam Yeung, Joey Yung, and Eason Chan.\n\nFeel 100% TV Series (2002)\n\nThis version is the most developed due to the lengthier nature of TV series. (It ran as 20 episodes of about 48 minutes each, split into 2 seasons of 11 and 9 episodes, respectively.) This was a popular version as it contained many of the newest Hong Kong stars. Also it makes many references to Hong Kong pop culture icons.\n\nFeel 100% 2003 (2003)\n\nThis incarnation is considered by some as the weakest. It is the first Feel 100% project without director Joe Ma attached to it. Starring Shawn Yue, Cyrus Wong and the Cookies, this film has been criticized as being hijacked by the Cookies. Indeed, all 9 of them show up in a variety of roles for this film.\n\n"}

(HMC), a Harvard-owned investment management company.\n\nHMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest. HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\nHMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity and is so exempt from federal income taxation.\n\nJack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%. In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. \"Bloomberg\" in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms—Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC—which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO. He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \"rebuild and reinvent\" the company.

She had been Wellesley College’s chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007–2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.\n\nStephen Blyth became the CEO of HMC on January 1, 2015. Blyth joined the firm in 2006, and previously held roles as Head of Internal Management and Head of Public Markets, responsible for investments in public equity, credit and fixed income markets. An alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard University, Blyth has also served as a Professor of the Practice of Statistics at Harvard University.\n\nMarc Seidner joined HMC as vice president for domestic fixed income in an effort to revamp the company's bond division in 2006. Mr. Seidner was previously the director of active core strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported on June 23, 2009, that Seidner was departing from the organization.

He re-established, and was the president of, the American Institute of Instruction, and was president of the Rhode Island Institute of Instruction and the National Educational Association. He was the president of the New England Publishing Company.\n\nIn 1914, wanting to have a town named for him, he offered a 1000-volume library to any town in Utah that would adopt his name. Two towns vied for the prize, Grayson and Thurber; the two towns compromised and in 1916 Thurber changed its name to Bicknell, and Grayson took the name of Blanding, the maiden name of Bicknell's wife. The towns then split the library with 500 books to each.\n\nBicknell and his wife, Amelia, donated $500 to the Rehoboth Antiquarian Society in Rehoboth, to establish the Blanding Public Library in memory of Amelia's parents, Christopher and Chloe Blanding.\n\nIn addition to education, he was also active in civic activities and the church. He served as commissioner from Rhode Island to the Universal Exposition at Vienna, Austria. He helped establish the U.S. Postal Code system as a member of the 1878 Postal Congress. He served as president in over thirty associations and organizations, and was a member in over one hundred. He was president of the International Sunday School Union, the Massachusetts Congregational Sunday School Union, the Chautauqua Teachers' Reading Union, and the New England Sunday School Association.\n\nBicknell was an author, editor, and publisher of the \"New England Journal of Education\" (Boston, 1875–1880). He was the author of the five-volume \"History of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations\", the author-publisher of \"The Governors of Rhode Island\", \"The Dorr War\", \"The Story of the Rhode Island Normal School\", and \"Story of Dr. John Clarke\", and the editor-publisher of \"History and Genealogy of the Bicknell Family and Collateral Lines\". As a historian he also contributed to \"The Bay State Monthly\" magazine.\n"}

It is located on the far south side of the city and was the original location of the South Side Irish Parade before it was relocated to the Beverly neighborhood farther southwest in the city.\n\nAuburn Gresham's development as a community dates back to the early nineteenth century, when the area was defined primarily by small German and Dutch settlements. A later influx of Irish railroad workers and others lured to the South Side by newly extended city services in the late nineteenth century led to further residential and commercial growth. In the 1920s, the population increased nearly threefold, from 19,558 to 57,381. The plethora of bungalow-style housing and brick two-flat apartment buildings throughout Auburn Gresham serves as lasting evidence of the community's formative years. Like most other Southside communities, Auburn Gresham suffered from blockbusting, rising crime, and white flight during the 1960s: the neighborhood was nearly 100% white in 1960, but flipped to being 69% black by the 1970 census.\n\nAuburn Gresham is serviced by a Metra commuter rail stop at W. 87th St. and Vincennes Ave., which provides daily inbound service to LaSalle Street Station in Chicago and outbound service to Joliet. Community leaders have long encouraged the construction of an additional Metra rail stop at W. 79th St. In 2014, the City of Chicago obtained a half-acre parcel of land on which to construct the station. CTA red line stops at 79th St. and 87th St. are also available along the Dan Ryan Expressway in nearby Chatham.\n\nChicago Public Library operates the Thurgood Marshall Branch in Auburn Gresham at W. 75th St. and S. Racine Ave. The 13,500 square foot library, which features a 125-seat auditorium, reading garden, and several artworks, opened in April 1994.\n\nSt. Sabina Church is located in the community, headed by Rev. Michael Pfleger. The church and its priest have been pivotal in helping transform Auburn Gresham, with new housing and store fronts opening up in the neighborhood. One of the largest new single-family home developments in Chicago is nearly complete at W. 87th St. and S. Parnell Ave., in the southeast corner of Auburn Gresham.\n\nAuburn Gresham is home to the St. Leo Campus for Veterans, which includes the Catholic Charities' St. Leo's Residence, the Auburn Gresham Community Based Outpatient Clinic, the St. Leo's Veteran's Garden, and the Pope John Paul II Residence. The community is also home to Perspectives Leadership Academy and Perspectives Technology Academy which are a part of the Renaissance 2010 program. Both schools are housed in the same building that was home to the former Calumet High School in the Auburn Gresham community. Calumet High School was one of Chicago's oldest high schools opening its doors to Auburn Gresham neighborhood students in 1919. The Auburn Gresham community is also home to the first urban S.O.S. Children's Village in the U.S.\n\nThe Auburn Gresham community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, the Auburn Gresham cast 19,286 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 272 votes for Donald Trump (97.29% to 1.37%). In the 2012 presidential election, Auburn Gresham cast 24,782 votes for Barack Obama and cast 130 votes for Mitt Romney (99.34% to 0.52%).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1892343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892343", "title": "Akira Hokuto", "text": "Akira Hokuto\n\nBorn Hisako Uno, Hokuto became a professional wrestler in the wake of the enormous popularity of tag team the Crush Gals (Chigusa Nagayo and Lioness Asuka), and was responsible for organizing the Bull Nakano fanclub. She joined the AJW dojo after quitting high school.\n\nDebuting for All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW) shortly before her eighteenth birthday, Hokuto immediately stood out from the crowd, winning AJW's Rookie of the Year award for 1985. The next year, she won the AJW Junior Championship, and participated in AJW's Match of the Year, paired with Yukari Omari in a losing effort against Chigusa Nagayo and Yumiko Hotta in the final of the annual Tag League the Best tournament.\n\nIn 1987, Hokuto won the AJW's top tag team belt, the WWWA World Tag Team Championship paired with Yumiko Hotta. Twelve days later, however, the two lost the titles to the Red Typhoons (Kazue Nagahori and Yumi Ogura) in a two out of three falls match. During the finish of the first fall, Hokuto took a tombstone piledriver off the second rope and broke her neck. She wrestled the entirety of the second and third falls, sometimes holding her head in place with her hands. This gained Hokuto a reputation for toughness.\n\nIn 1990, Hokuto was booked to win the Japan Grand Prix, AJW's annual tournament to determine the number one contender to the top singles belt, the WWWA World Single Championship. However, she once again suffered a severe injury. During a Grand Prix match against Manami Toyota, Hokuto performed a plancha and crashed her knee into the ringside metal barrier. She tore open her knee, and was rendered unable to walk. Crying, she tied a bandage around her leg, pulled herself back into the ring, and attempted to continue the match. It was clearly impossible, however, and she was removed from the tournament. When Hokuto returned to singles competition, she slowly revealed a new, more dynamic, persona. She grew her hair longer and bleached it blonde, wore flashy attire, used stylised make-up to complement her features and called herself \"Akira Hokuto\", after popular wrestler Akira Maeda. Teaming with Suzuka Minami as the Marine Wolves, she won the WWWA Tag Team belts twice more. She also won the All Pacific Championship in 1991 and 1992, and sustained many more injuries (earning the nickname 'the Mummy' since she so often came to the ring wrapped in bandages).\n\nThe year 1993 is considered by many to be the best year of her career. She feuded with Shinobu Kandori of the LLPW promotion during the inter-promotional period, where the major promotions active in women's wrestling in Japan at the time combined to run shows with dream match-ups that attracted some of the largest cards in history. At AJW All-Star Dreamslam on April 2, 1993, Hokuto defeated Kandori, which was given a perfect five-star rating by Dave Meltzer and is considered by some to be the greatest women's match in history.\n\nHokuto was subsequently defeated by Kandori in a tag match at Dreamslam II nine days later and in a singles match in December of that year. Also in 1993 she won the Japan Grand Prix and was granted another shot at the WWWA Championship, against champion Aja Kong on October 9. Hokuto was again injured in August of that year, and requested that the match be made a non-title match, since she felt wrestling in her injured state would insult the prestige of the belt.\n\nLater that year, having married Mexican wrestler Antonio Gómez Medina who worked as \"Máscara Mágica\", Hokuto moved to Mexico. She continued her career in her new home, adopting the persona \"Reina Jabuki\"\". On July 30, 1994, she defeated La Diabólica for the CMLL World Women's Championship, and carried it for over two years. Later that year, having divorced her first husband and returned to Japan, she defeated Aja Kong in the final of the interpromotional V*Top Woman Tournament at the Big Egg Wrestling Universe event, which drew a gate of 42,500 to the Tokyo Dome. Hokuto had one her last great matches for AJW on September 2, 1995, losing a thrilling 21-minute battle against Manami Toyota.\n\nOn November 26, 1995, Hokuto made her U.S. debut at the World War 3 pay-per-view event. Managed by Sonny Onoo, she teamed with Bull Nakano and defeated the team of Cutie Suzuki and Mayumi Ozaki. The same teams competed in a match on Monday Night Nitro the following night, with Hokuto and Nakano winning again.\n\nHokuto and several other GAEA wrestlers, including Chigusa Nagayo, KAORU, Meiko Satomura, and Sonoko Kato, came to America to compete in a tournament to crown the first WCW Women's Champion. Hokuto competed in the first round of the tournament twice, using both the Akira Hokuto and Reina Jabuki gimmicks. As Reina Jabuki, she lost in the first round to Madusa Miceli. Due to this TV appearance, she was stripped of the CMLL title. As Akira Hokuto, she won the tournament, defeating Madusa in the finals, held at WCW's Starrcade on December 29, 1996, in Nashville, Tennessee. Hokuto later defeated Madusa at WCW's The Great American Bash on June 15, 1997, a match where Madusa was forced to 'retire' due to a stipulation. This was the last time Hokuto ever appeared in WCW and the Women's Championship was apparently dropped, as it was never defended or mentioned again. This made her the only WCW Women's Champion.\n\nIn 1996, she left AJW and joined Chigusa Nagayo's new promotion, Gaea Japan. Unlike most Japanese women wrestlers, who retire when they marry and start a family, she returned to the ring in 1999 and won GAEA's AAAW Tag Team Championship in 2000 with Mayumi Ozaki. The year 2000 also saw her induction into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in recognition of her skill and contributions.\n\nFor her retirement match on April 7, 2002, Hokuto teamed up with Meiko Satomura to face Ayako Hamada and Chigusa Nagayo. Hokuto was wrestling with a broken rib, but, just as she had done so many times before, she defied the pain, and scored the pin on Hamada with the Northern Lights Bomb. In the post-match retirement ceremony, some of Hokuto's colleagues entered the ring, gave her flowers, hugged her, and bowed to her. She even slapped a few of them, including Satomura, and Sakura Hirota (slapping is considered a way to transfer part of her fighting spirit). This was followed by a ten-gong salute before Hokuto was showered with streamers. She then walked up the walkway where she was met by husband Kensuke Sasaki and their son.\n\nDespite retiring in 2002, Hokuto has wrestled occasionally since then, including a 10-man tag team match for All Japan Pro Wrestling in 2004 where she teamed with her husband Sasaki, Genichiro Tenryu, Katsuhiko Nakajima and Kenshin to defeat RO&D (Jamal, Taiyo Kea, Buchanan, D-Lo Brown and Taka Michinoku). In her last match to date on February 11, 2006, at a Kensuke Office show, she took part in a battle royal where the winner would receive ¥120,000. The match was eventually won by Minoru Suzuki. She also served as the chief executive officer of Hawaii Championship Wrestling for a period of time during a Japan vs. Hawaii feud, as well as engaged in several squash matches against comedy wrestler Stalker Ichikawa, and became the first woman in history to compete in a match in All Japan Pro Wrestling against Kendo Kashin, a match that Hokuto won in just 3 minutes with the aid of outside interference.\n\nWhile retired from active competition, Hokuto has stayed busy raising her family, helping her husband Kensuke run his Kensuke Office/Diamond Ring promotion, and making occasional appearances on Japanese radio and television.\n\nKensuke Sasaki and Akira Hokuto were voted one of Japan's leading celebrity couples in 2006. Hokuto has also assisted her husband in various publicity and\ncharitable activities in his position as Japan's Friendship Ambassador to Fiji for the year 2007.\n\nShe has made various media appearances as a \"mother celebrity\". In 2010, for example, she appeared in a television commercial for \"Mama Gohan\" (lit. \"Mama Meal\"), a co-product by Ajinomoto and popular women's magazine \"I Love Mama\", along with three female gyaru-mother models.\n\nHokuto married Kensuke Sasaki on October 1, 1995, after Sasaki proposed to her on their first date. Hokuto became pregnant in early 1998 and gave birth to her first son, Kennosuke on November 6, 1998. Hokuto gave birth to her second son, Seinosuke in March 2003. In addition to their two biological children, Hokuto and Kensuke have formed a very strong, almost parental bond with Kensuke's protégé Katsuhiko Nakajima.\n\nOn September 23, 2015, Hokuto announced she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was undergoing surgery the following day to have her right breast removed. The surgery was successful and will need several months to recuperate.\n\n\n"}

It was originally broadcast on NBC as a two-part miniseries on May 16 and 17, 1999.\n\nBradshaw Disposal Services has a nuclear bomb made in Russia to transport, and an employee (named Henry Bradshaw) decides to save money by concealing it on a freight train. This train is also loaded with hazardous and flammable chemicals, including metallic sodium, which spontaneously ignites on contact with water. The train suffers a brake failure and becomes a runaway heading for Denver. John Seger, a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator, boards the train and with the assistance of the railwaymen tries various ways to stop the train. Several ideas are tried, such as coupling a following train to the caboose (the coupling mechanism on the caboose breaks, which also results in the death of one of the train's crew members), a derailing attempt (after it is revealed the catastrophe the chemicals would cause if ignited) in which a helicopter narrowly avoids being hit, and finally, an attempt at manually activating the brakes (via hitting a part of the engine mechanism with a wrench). The final attempt works successfully but is short-lived. The following rescue train, unaware of the freight's slowing, speeds forward and crushes the caboose (killing an injured crew member in the process). The force disengages the brakes, this time for good, causing the train to speed up once again. Meanwhile, Denver residents are struggling to collect their families and then leave town, despite rioters, looters, and gridlock. Realizing that there is no way to stop it, John and the engineer (who was initially reluctant) abandon the train by jumping off before it can speed up too much.\n\nThe train derails and becomes a terrific wreck. Discovering the now highly unstable bomb on board, firefighters struggle to extinguish the fire at the crash site. After realizing that metallic sodium is on the train, the firefighters and NEST teams retreat to evaluate a strategy. In the meantime, all fire-fighting aircraft are grounded. The misinterpretation of a radio call to a water bombing helicopter leads it to dump its load of water onto the wreck. Water comes into contact with the metallic sodium, which explodes and in turn causes the nuclear bomb to detonate. The blast causes severe damage throughout Denver and releases an electromagnetic pulse. No cars work, electricity is down and anything with a computer is shut down.\n\nAfter the blast, Denver lies in ruins. John (who made it back to town via helicopter) then attempts to get his family out of Denver before nuclear fallout starts. After finding a working car, John eventually reunites with his family at a FEMA refugee camp in Eminence, Kansas.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1912, Cerro has won 32 Primera División titles and is one of the most popular football clubs in Paraguay. Its president is Raúl Zapag, from Paraguay, and the manager is Francisco Arce. Its main rivals are Olimpia and Libertad.\n\nThey play their home games at the General Pablo Rojas Stadium, also known as \"La Nueva Olla\" (The New Boiler).\n\nCerro Porteño was founded on October 1, 1912 by Susana Núñez and a group of young people looking to create a new football club. At the time of Cerro's foundation the situation in Paraguay was tense with instability in the government caused by the fervent rivalries between the two leading political parties, the \"Partido Colorado\" (Colorado Party) and the \"Partido Liberal\" (Liberal Party). Because of the tensions, the founders of the club decided to use the colours of both parties, red (Colorados) and blue (Liberales), as the club's colours as a symbol of unity and friendship between Paraguayans. Later, white was used on the shorts to complete the colours of the Paraguayan flag.\n\nThe club owes its name to the battle fought between the forces of Buenos Aires, Argentina (\"The Porteños\") and the Paraguayan army, in the neighbourhood of the \"Cerro Mbaé\" (Mbaé Hill) – named after that battle as the \"Cerro Porteño\" (Porteño Hill) – on 19 January 1811. During that battle, the troops of Paraguay (at that time a Spanish colony) were abandoned by the Spanish governor but continued to be led by the Paraguayan officials, who led them to a great victory against the Porteños troops. That battle is known as the \"Battle of Cerro Porteño\" and is a highlight of Paraguayan military history.\n\nOver the years the club has won a significant number of national championships. However, to date, it has not won any international tournaments despite a few good runs in the Copa Libertadores including semi-final appearances in 1973, 1978, 1993, 1998, 1999 and 2011.\n\nOsvaldo Ardiles joined the club as manager in May 2008 but was sacked in August of the same year after a string of poor results and was replaced by Pedro Troglio.\nIn 2014, Cerro Porteño president Juan José Zapag spoke in reference to the corruption in Paraguayan football that various persons had complained to him about not buying games and that if his club were to win then they would not do it by buying and doping players to become champions.\n\nCerro Porteño's stadium, named General Pablo Rojas and also known as \"La Nueva Olla\", is located in Asunción's Obrero neighborhood (Avenida Acuña de Figueroa 823). It has a seating capacity of 45,000, making it the biggest in Paraguay.\n\n\n\n\n\n1970's\n\n1980's\n\n1990's\n\n2000's\n\n2010's\nNon-CONMEBOL players\n\nMost appearances for the club (in all competitions):\n\nMost goals for the club (in all competitions):\n\nMost appearances for the club (in league):\n\nMost goals for the club (in league):\n\nMost appearances for the club (in international cup):\n\nMost goals for the club (in international cup):\n\nThe women's team has won the Paraguayan women's football championship four times, in 2007 and 2012 to 2014.

Like many other New Japan stars before and after him, Maeda embarked on a foreign tour to the United Kingdom, where he adopted the Kwik-kik-Lee moniker. In 1983, he participated in the first International Wrestling Grand Prix tournament, won by Hulk Hogan. He was one of three Japanese entrants to the international tournament, alongside Antonio Inoki and Rusher Kimura.\n\nMaeda would briefly join Vince McMahon's WWF for a few months in the Spring of 1984 working in the opening matches of shows and even appearing a few times in televised bouts.\n\nIn 1984, Maeda, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and other New Japan defectors formed the Japanese UWF. It was during his time in the first incarnation of the UWF that his willingness to show his displeasure in the ring became known; he quarreled with Satoru Sayama (the original Tiger Mask) over the direction of the UWF, as Maeda and other wrestlers were reportedly resentful of Sayama's cramming too much creative power. This included booking himself to win all his matches, where others, Maeda included, \"jobbed\" in the worked matches. The promotion folded a year later, and Maeda returned to New Japan, where he became one of the promotion's biggest stars.\n\nMaeda became involved in a real-life feud with New Japan booker and top star, Antonio Inoki, refusing to work with him in what could have been a huge moneymaking program. In April 1986, he was involved in one of the most surreal moments in wrestling history during a match with André the Giant; neither man could agree to losing the match. Andre appeared drunk and started no selling Maeda's moves. Then Maeda proceeded to shoot kick André's legs and repeatedly take him down. After 30 minutes of this, André voluntarily laid down to be pinned (in spite of being assured that Maeda would lose the match), but Akira refused to do so. Inoki eventually came to the ring and demanded the match to end, much to the bewilderment of the audience. On November 19, 1987, during a six-man tag team match, as Riki Choshu was putting his opponent, Osamu Kido, in a \"Sasori-gatame\", Maeda delivered a legitimate kick to Choshu's face, breaking his orbital bone. The resulting injury would sideline Choshu for well over a month, and Maeda was immediately suspended for his actions. In February 1988, the final straw came when Maeda was fired by New Japan for refusing to go on a training excursion to Mexico.\n\nIn 1988, Maeda formed Newborn UWF with Nobuhiko Takada and others, this time as its number one star, using the notoriety he gained in New Japan to draw large crowds. Maeda's UWF became the first promotion to hold a show at the Tokyo Dome, drawing 60,000 to watch Maeda defeat Willy Wilhelm in the main event. In December 1990, Newborn UWF dissolved due to disagreements over the direction of the company.\n\nMaeda would go on to form Fighting Network RINGS in 1991, while Nobuhiko Takada formed Union of Wrestling Force International with most of the Newborn UWF roster. Fighting Network RINGS would no longer bill itself as wrestling in 1997, after the collapse of UWF International. In 1999 he retired from active competition after being defeated in a match against three-time Olympic Gold medalist Alexander Karelin, drawing an incredible gate of $2.5 million. The match gained widespread media coverage, including mentions in \"The New York Times\" and \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nFollowing Maeda's retirement, he switched his promotion's style from shoot-style to competitive mixed martial arts fighting. The new Rings held two King of Kings tournaments, which introduced such mixed martial artists as Fedor Emelianenko, Dan Henderson, Randy Couture, Jeremy Horn and Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira to the Japanese audience. RINGS folded in 2002, due to the growing popularity of PRIDE.\n\nWhen K-1 wanted to start a new MMA brand after their previous attempt with \"K-1 Romanex\", Fighting and Entertainment Group hired Maeda as a consultant for Hero's. However, FEG retired Hero's in February 2008 to team up with former PRIDE staff to create DREAM. Maeda's new project was called \"The Outsider\", an amateur MMA series that uses Hero's rules. RINGS brand was revived for \"The Outsider\" series and several events have been held since March 30, 2008.\n\nOn January 22, 2012, Maeda decisively resurrected the Fighting Network RINGS brand with Battle Genesis: Vol. 9, the continuation of the \"Battle Genesis\" series the last event of which was held on September 20, 2001. The event was sanctioned by ZST.\n\nMaeda's interest in martial arts developed as a schoolboy while watching the \"Ultraman\" television series. By the time he was in high school, his only interests were motorcycles and karate.\n\nMaeda was a third-generation Zainichi Korean prior to naturalization.\n\nHe is an 8th degree black belt in Kyokushin Budokai.\n\n"}

He is perhaps best known for his nature and animal motifs, especially with dramatic situations. He was the most important and probably most influential Swedish wildlife painter of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.\n\nLiljefors was born in Uppsala, Sweden. His parents were Anders Liljefors and Maria Margareta Lindbäck. He was brother of the composer and conductor Ruben Liljefors (1871–1936). He went to Uppsala Cathedral School for six years. He received instruction from 1879-82 at the Swedish Royal Academy of Fine Arts. From 1882-83, he made a study trip to Düsseldorf, Baiern, Venice, Florence, Naples, Rome and Paris. He received inspiration from the Scandinavian artist colony in Grez-sur-Loing. In 1886, he became a member of the Artists' Union (\"Konstnärsförbundet\") who which was in opposition to the Royal Academy. From 1888-89, he taught at Valand Academy in Gothenburg.\nIn 1887, he married Anna Olivia Olofsson (1864-1947). The marriage ended with a divorce in 1895 at which time he married his first wife's younger sister Signe Adolfina Helena Olofsson (1871-1944). He was a resident of Uppsala, until the summer of 1894 when he sought out the Stockholm archipelago. From 1905-17, he lived at Ytterjärnain Södermanland and from 1917 to Österbybruk in Uppland. He established a studio in Österbybruk where he lived and worked between 1917 and 1932.\n\nDuring the last years of the nineteenth century, a brooding element entered his work, perhaps the result of turmoil in his private life. He was often short of money and in 1925, he suffered a facial neuralgia with severe pain. From 1932, Liljefors lived at Kungsholmen in Stockholm. The last two years of his life he spent in Uppsala. Liljefors died during 1939 and was buried at the Uppsala old cemetery. \nLiljefors is held in high esteem by painters of wildlife and is acknowledged as an influence by, for example, American wildlife artist Michael Coleman. All his life Liljefors was a hunter, and he often painted predator-prey action, the hunts engaged between fox and hare, sea eagle and eider, and goshawk and black grouse serving as prime examples. However, he never exaggerated the ferocity of the predator or the pathos of the prey, and his pictures are devoid of sentimentality.\n\nThe darker quality in his paintings gradually began to attract interest, and he had paintings exhibited at the Paris Salon.\nThe influence of the Impressionists can be seen in his attention to the effects of environment and light, and later that of Art Nouveau in his \"Mallards, Evening\" of 1901, in which the pattern of the low sunlight on the water looks like leopardskin, hence the Swedish nickname \"Panterfällen\". Bruno was fascinated by the patterns to be found in nature, and he often made art out of the camouflage patterns of animals and birds. He particularly loved painting capercaillies against woodland, and his most successful painting of this subject is the large-scale \"Capercaillie Lek\", 1888, in which he captures the atmosphere of the forest at dawn. He was also influenced by Japanese art, for example in his \"Goldfinches\", painted in the late 1880s.\n\nCollections of his art are on display at the Nationalmuseum, Gothenburg Museum of Art, Thiel Gallery and Uppsala University.\n\nHe amassed a collection of animals to act as his living models. Ernst Malmberg recalled:\nThe greatness of Liljefors lay in his ability to show animals in their environment. Sometimes he achieved this through hunting and observation of the living animal, and sometimes he used dead animals; for example, his \"Hawk and Black Game\", painted in the winter of 1883–84, was based on dead specimens, but he also used his memory of the flocks of black grouse in the meadows around a cottage he once lived in at Ehrentuna, near Uppsala. He wrote:\n\nSuch practices have sometimes led to criticism of Liljefors' work; Lars Jonsson has noted a \"heraldisation\" of the drama in \"Golden Eagle Chasing a Hare\", 1904, which causes a departure from pure naturalism, and he deduces from the position of the eagle's wing feathers that it would have been gliding rather than turning in reaction to the hare as painted.\n\nNevertheless, Liljefors was a pioneer at a time when wildlife art was still emerging from its association with scientific depiction and taxidermy. He also set a standard of identification with the landscape that substantially influenced the development of wildlife art in the twentieth century.\n\n\n"}

Other definitions also exist, see below. These glasses are typically used to serve beer, and also often for cider.\n\nThe common shapes of pint glass are:\n\n\nPint glasses became popular in the United Kingdom in the early/mid-20th century, replacing tankards (pewter, ceramic and glass). This change is notably lamented by George Orwell in his 1946 essay \"The Moon Under Water\".\n\nOlder styles include:\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, draught beer must be sold in Imperial measure (see ). United Kingdom law requires certain steps be taken to ensure that a pint of beer is indeed a pint. Though this can be achieved using \"metered dispense\" (calibrated pumps), the more common solution is to use certified one-pint glasses. Until recently these had a crown stamp indicating that the certification had been done by an agency of the Crown. The number etched upon the glasses stands for the manufacturing company or site. Most pint glasses used in the United Kingdom today have actually been produced in France.\n\nUnder the EU Measuring Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/22/EC), the certification of measuring instruments and devices used in trade (including beer mugs, weighbridges, petrol pumps and the like) can be done by third parties anywhere within the EU with governments taking \"only the legislative and enforcement (market surveillance) functions\" and \"ensuring that the system of third party assessment ... has sufficient technical competence and independence\" (or, in simple language, calibration services were privatised). Glasses that have been certified by authorised firms anywhere within the EU have the letters CE etched on with the certifying agency's identification number.\nConservatives campaigning to have dual markings of crown and CE were informed by EU Commissioner Günter Verheugen that \"a Crown stamp look-alike could naturally be affixed to the glass, as long as it is done in such a way that it is not confused with the CE marking\".\n\nSelling beer in unmeasured glasses without using some other form of calibrated measure is illegal. Half-pint, one-third pint and two-thirds pint (schooners) glasses are also available, and are subject to the same laws.\n\nAlthough the glass must be accurately-calibrated, industry guidelines only require a pint to be at least 95% liquid, allowing 5% of the pint to consist of the foamy 'head'. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has described this practice as selling a short measure, and says that it costs drinkers £1m a day in beer they have paid for but not received. The British Beer and Pub Association has issued guidelines for bar staff to give a 'top up' to any drinker who is unsatisfied with the measure they receive.\n\nCAMRA recommends the use of \"lined\" or \"oversized\" glasses in pubs. These have a line near the top (usually labelled \"pint to line\") to which the beer should be poured, with the head forming above it. In the past a number of breweries supplied these glasses to their pubs; this is now rarely the case and lined glasses are found mostly at enthusiasts' events such as beer festivals, serious cask ale pubs, and breweries' own bars.\n\nBeer in Australia is formally measured in metric units, but draught beer is commonly ordered and sold in glasses approximating imperial measures, including a 570 ml pint. (In the state of South Australia, \"pint\" refers to a 425 ml ( pint) glass, known as a schooner in the rest of Australia.) As in the UK, certified glassware must be used; the capacity of the beer glass is defined by either the brim or, where present, the fill line. There are no legally prescribed sizes for beer volumes, but the stated capacities, which are a legal requirement, must be formally tested by the hoteliers and breweries.\n\nIn Canada, Federal law mandates a standard imperial pint. However, this law is rarely enforced, and establishments typically sell US pints or other measures as \"pints.\"\n\nThe Republic of Ireland uses the imperial 20 fl oz pint measure (≈568 ml), where legal metrology marks are used to show that a glass has passed inspection by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, a state-run body which enforces a number of standard rulings. Starting in 2006, the NSAI \"pint\" mark, a circle featuring two wavy lines, between which \"PINT\" is written, with a year mark (last two digits), and a three digit batch code either side; has begun to be phased out with a European standard \"PINT\"/CE logo stamp . Smaller Pint glasses have been used in pubs and nightclubs though.\n\nIn Israel, although officially defined as 568ml, pubs use the term rather arbitrarily and the \"pints\" served constitute a wide range of volumes (360ml–440ml). In the past, the custom was to serve beer in 330ml or 500ml in the original beer manufacture's glass. After the reform in the alcohol taxes in July 2012 the tax rate doubled. Each liter of beer is charged with 4.2nis tax. In order to avoid raising prices at the pubs, and as a result, the loss of customers, a new \"magic\" appeared, called \"pint\". The customers don't really know the vague term of a pint, and it varies from place to place. Some of the places didn't even change the menu, and it's served as 500 ml.\n\nIn the United States, a pint is . However, the typical conical \"pint\" glass holds 16 oz. to its rim. With a half-inch of foam, the actual liquid fill is roughly 14 oz. In recent years, some restaurants replaced pint glasses with glasses, to which customers objected. In response to this, legislation in the state of Michigan (known for its craft brewing culture) requires bars to serve 16-ounce pints.\n\nIt is increasingly common to find pint glasses which contain markings on the base; very often these glasses are branded to one particular beer. The markings themselves are formed from small pits which aid in nucleation, allowing the gas within it to be released more easily, thus preserving the head. Without the aid of these pits a regular pint glass will keep a head for only 3 or 4 minutes before appearing 'flat'. The markings come in a variety of styles ranging from a simple circular or square hatched pattern to more complicated branding messages.\n\nPint glass collecting is an increasingly popular way for individuals to commemorate their visits to popular tourist destinations, most notably to microbreweries or sports arenas. These destinations often sell pint glasses adorned with their logos, which are either screen-printed or engraved on the side of the glass. Brewery enthusiasts may travel thousands of miles to see where their favorite beer is made or to sample new local and fresh beers, and collectors often display their collections (which sometimes total in the hundreds) in display cases or on shelves.\n\nBeer festivals frequently have commemorative pint glasses made specially for the event.\n\nAs with other glass objects such as glass bottles, pint glasses can be used as a weapon, either smashing an intact glass in a victim's face or smashing the glass and then slashing with the shards. Such attacks, called \"glassing\", are a significant problem in the United Kingdom, with more than 87,000 glassing attacks per year, resulting in over 5,000 injuries. This has led to less-dangerous alternatives being used, either plastic glasses and bottles at large events or violence-prone venues, or treated glass, primarily tempered glass, which has been used in Australia.\n\n"}

In 1895 it was sold to Andrew Carnegie, who moved the mill to Homestead, Pennsylvania. The mill was Uniontown's largest industry in the early 1890s. \n\nThe Columbia Rolling Mill had a substantial number of employees, especially in its first years of operation. It was serviced by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The mill reported marginal gains in 1887, 1888, and 1889. Although the gains were small, it proved those who thought the mill would quickly fold to be wrong. A small-scale strike hampered the mill in 1890. In 1891 and 1892, the mill reported losses. However, in 1893 the mill recovered and in 1894, the mill took in substantial gains. 1895 appeared to be another solid year, when suddenly, the mill was sold and moved. Andrew Carnegie paid an impressive sum for the mill and many Uniontown citizens lost their jobs.\n\nThe Columbia Rolling Mill had since been a topic of great controversy in Uniontown. In the late 19th century, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was gaining footing as an iron and steel producing giant. Andrew Carnegie had fabulous transportation services, thanks to the Monongahela, Allegheny, and Ohio Rivers, and to the railroads servicing Pittsburgh. Much of the coal that was used in the Pittsburgh mills was obtained from the hills surrounding Connellsville, Pennsylvania, a neighboring town to Uniontown. Supposedly, Carnegie feared that a mill in Uniontown could lead to an Uniontown and Connellsville alliance that could hurt his profits. Uniontown was considerably closer to the rich coal fields than Pittsburgh, thus transportation costs will be cheaper. While Uniontown had no major waterways, the neighboring town of Brownsville, Pennsylvania, a shipbuilding center, was located on the Monongahela River. If Carnegie would not have seized the Columbia Rolling Mill before he did, other mills may have opened in the Uniontown area, causing problems for Carnegie.\n"}

The character first appeared on-screen on 19 May 2000. During her time on the show, Maria has been the centre of major storylines. In late-2009, Longchambon took maternity leave and Maria was off-screen from November 2009 until June 2010. Longchambon went on maternity leave again in 2015 and Maria was off-screen from October 2015 until April 2016. In June 2019, it was announced that Longchambon had signed a new contract keeping her with the show for at least another 12 months.\n\nMaria is first seen working in the kennels belonging to her father, Eric (Steve Money). Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) and Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) bring Tyrone's greyhound, Monica, in to look for a stud to mate with. Maria and Tyrone are immediately attracted to one another and the pair begin a relationship. Tyrone proposes to Maria at the top of Blackpool Tower and she happily accepts. However, their relationship quickly dissolves as Tyrone succumbs to his feelings for Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine), leading a heartbroken Maria to end their engagement.\n\nLater, she romances Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). After deciding to change careers, she takes a hairdressing course. She is then hired by Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) at the salon as a junior stylist but does not get along with Audrey or fellow stylist Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw). Maria ends her romance with Jason after discovering that he had sex with Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson). She and her friend Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor) later move into the flat above the salon, having become good friends on a trip to Blackpool, where Maria saved Fiz from being arrested after Maria's brother Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment), who had followed them on the trip with Fiz, Tyrone and Jason, broke into an empty caravan to find a place to stay without telling the others. Maria attends Gail Platt (Helen Worth) and Richard Hillman's (Brian Capron) wedding in July 2002, where she meets Gail's son Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickitt). Maria realises she has fallen in love with Nick and they embark on a romance. They decide to run away to Canada, with Maria turning Tyrone down when he comes to the airport to beg her to stay. Nick worked all hours, leaving a bored Maria home alone. She dumps him and returns soon after. Upon her return, she takes a job at the Rovers Return Inn and changes her image, becoming more promiscuous and fashion-conscious. Maria moves back into the flat where Fiz had moved in her absence. There is an uneasy truce between the former rivals for Tyrone's affection, especially since Fiz is now seeing Kirk and Maria is unhappy about her brother spending so much time in the flat, but the pair soon become close friends. Maria has a casual relationship with Vikram Desai (Chris Bisson) and is pleased when he takes her on holiday abroad, unaware he is merely using her as cover for drug smuggling to pay off his debts. When Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) finds out what Vik is up to, he forces him to leave town without saying goodbye to Maria. In late-2002, Toyah arrives home with a new boyfriend, her tutor from college, John Arnley (Paul Warriner). Maria ends up having a one-night stand with John in January 2003 but is shocked when John wants nothing to do with her afterwards. Fiz discovers Maria and John's affair but keeps the secret. However, she struggles to conceal it when Maria announces she is pregnant. Maria later has an abortion but when Toyah finds out she slept with John, Maria denies responsibility, leading Toyah to believe John raped Maria and attacks him. When Toyah realises the truth, she refuses to forgive Maria and leaves Weatherfield, resulting in her family blaming Maria for driving her away.\n\nMaria's sloppy work habits soon found her on the wrong side of her boss Shelley Unwin's (Sally Lindsay) mother Bev (Susie Blake). Even though Bev had goaded Maria into causing a scene while working, family loyalty wins out and Maria is sacked. She soon persuades Audrey to take her back on at the salon. She takes a dislike to fellow stylist, Candice, who took her ex-boyfriend Jason from her and who Audrey moves into the flat with her and Fiz, although they eventually become friends. She also shares with Claire Casey (Julia Haworth) for a time. In April 2004, Nick, another of Maria's ex-boyfriends, returns and the pair reconcile. However Nick's ex-wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) returns months later, and after hearing what Maria had done to her stepsister Toyah, succeeds in splitting Nick and Maria. Nick leaves Weatherfield, taking a job in Nottingham. Maria stays on in the flat above Street Cars where she and Nick were living and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) moves his mother, Liz (Beverley Callard) into the flat in November 2004 as Maria's flatmate. She \"borrows\" £200 from the petty cash at the salon to go on holiday with her latest fling, Dave, and Tyrone lends her the money to pay it back before Audrey finds out. After Audrey tells her it is better to marry a good man who is loyal to you rather than go after looks, Maria reunites with Tyrone and the couple resumes dating in late-2004, with Maria moving in with Tyrone at No.9 Coronation Street. Even though she has a one-night stand with another man, Stuart (Junior Laniyan), they become engaged again. In 2005, Maria's parents relocate to Cyprus. Maria is disappointed that Eric intends to leave the kennel business to Kirk and persuades him to give her a half share but leaves all the work to Kirk. Kirk accidentally allows a pedigree bulldog to be gelded and has to sell the business to pay compensation to the owner, leaving himself and Maria with little profit. Maria and Tyrone later break up after she keeps trying to change his personality, giving him a back wax because she is embarrassed by his physique, and he discovers she does not love him as much as he loves her when she reacts with horror on having a pregnancy scare.\n\nMaria begins renting the flat alongside the builder's yard from Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). Even though he is dating Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Charlie sets out to seduce Maria, installing security cameras at the yard to watch Maria's flat and staging a break-in to make her feel vulnerable. Maria falls for Charlie and begins an affair with him but when David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) finds out and tries to blackmail Charlie, Charlie tries to drown him in Maria's bath. Maria stops him and admits the affair to Tracy, resulting in a fight between the two women in the street. Even though she wants nothing more to do with Charlie, Maria is the only resident aside from Jason to be upset when Tracy murders him in revenge for the affair.\n\nMaria starts dating property developer Chris Pitcher but is disappointed to learn he considers her beneath him and is only interested in a casual relationship. Maria is reminded of the way she treated Tyrone and tries to resume her romance with him, even though he is now dating Molly Compton (Vicky Binns), but he turns her down. Maria later begins a relationship with Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier) and moves in with him. Maria finds that she is pregnant, and Liam proposes. Unknown to Maria, Liam has captured his sister-in-law Carla Connor's (Alison King) affections, which causes Maria some anxiety, but they still marry. Maria is horrified to realise that the baby has stopped kicking and an emergency scan shows that the baby has died. She delivers a stillborn baby boy who she names Paul after Liam's late brother, Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher) and Liam finds himself drawn to Carla. The secret lovers are discovered by Carla's fiancée Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) who has Liam murdered in a hit and run attack. The same night, Liam's sister, Michelle (Kym Marsh) realises Maria is pregnant again. Maria learns about Liam's affair when a drunken Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) shows her video footage of Carla and Liam in each other's arms at Carla's wedding to Tony. The video was taken by her daughter, Rosie (Helen Flanagan). Maria becomes suspicious of Tony when she learns that he knew about the affair before marrying Carla and suspects he is involved in Liam's death. She begins a harassment campaign against Tony, who considers killing Maria to silence her. Maria almost runs Tony over in her car, causing him minor injuries, and he refuses to press charges against her.\n\nCarla discovers Maria was right and flees Weatherfield, leaving Tony a broken man. When Maria finds Tony mourning at Liam's grave on her wedding anniversary, they call a truce and build a close friendship. When Maria goes into labour on a day trip to the beach, Tony delivers her baby, another boy that she names Liam Anthony Connor, after Liam and Tony. Tony suggested that she call him Sandy as he was born at a beach, but Maria was determined to name her son after his dad. Tony proposes to Maria and she accepts. Maria discovers the truth about Tony when he suffers a heart attack and confesses to Roy Cropper (David Neilson) that he had Liam murdered. Roy's wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) informs a heartbroken Maria. She refuses to believe it but Tony admits it, causing Maria to have a breakdown and asks them to raise Liam but they make her realise that she has done nothing wrong and is a fit mother to Liam. They persuade her that she simply needs a change of scene so she and baby Liam go to Ireland with them.\n\nMaria returns to Weatherfield in June 2010, announcing her intention to stay and moves into the salon flat with Liam and Kirk. The same month, Tony escapes from prison and with the help of a former cellmate's plans to kidnap Carla and Hayley in the \"Underworld\" factory. Robbie tricks Carla into entering the factory alone with her and holds her at gunpoint, tying her to a chair and taping her mouth shut. Robbie then tricks Hayley into coming to the factory, saying Carla has had an accident. Hayley sees Carla bound and gagged, but is held at gunpoint too and tied to a chair. Tony appears and announces his plans to kill them. Maria appears to see Carla, and Tony forces her to try and get rid of Maria. When Carla tries to warn Maria, Tony knocks her unconscious and pulls Maria into the hostage situation. Tony threatens to kill Maria if she tells anyone but she escapes and raises the alarm. Tony eventually lets Hayley go and sets fire to the factory to kill himself and Carla. However, Carla manages to untie herself and escapes, although Tony walks into the inferno and kills himself. Carla then offers Maria a job as a personal assistant at \"Underworld\", and she agrees. Carla sends Maria to Frank Foster's (Andrew Lancel) house all dressed up for an informal meeting. Frank attempts to kiss Maria despite her telling him she has a boyfriend and when he doesn't stop, she begins panicking. When she tries to stand up from the sofa, Frank forces her back down, his hands wandering but she manages to fend him off. She escapes and rushes home crying and shaken. Over the next few weeks, Maria has to put up with Frank's appearances at \"Underworld\", Maria informs Carla of what he did, but after numerous apologies, Frank agrees to business with the factory. Maria reaches breaking point when Carla announces that Frank has bought into the business and will be a new partner, she slaps Carla and quits her job after Carla says that Maria provoked the attack on herself. Having reached the end of her tether, Maria eventually reports Frank to the police. Frank is arrested the next day, but there is not enough evidence so the police do not press any charges. Maria then returns to her old job as a hairdresser at Audrey's Salon, alongside David and Audrey.\n\nMaria receives a phone call from a distressed Carla, on the eve of her wedding to Frank, asking her to come over to her flat. Upon arrival, a shocked Maria finds Carla cowering on the floor, revealing that Frank has raped her. Maria puts her feud with Carla to one side and is immediately supportive, helping Carla as she reports the attack to the police. She supports Carla as she presses charges on Frank. Michelle returns from her cruise and the three sisters-in-law support Carla as Frank faces trial, he is found 'not guilty'. Maria later begins fawning over gay friend; Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou) and he moves in with her, after splitting from his then boyfriend Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). After constant complaining about being single, her friends decide to deceive her into reconciling with her ex-boyfriend, Jason. She has sex with him and they resume dating. Jason is preparing to move in with Maria until Maria discovers a lump on her breast, who confides in Marcus and after undergoing a biopsy, she learns that the lump is benign. After celebrating with Marcus, the pair share a surprise kiss, but later agree that it was a mistake. However, Maria later realises she is in love with Marcus but he is dating Aiden Lester (Toby Sawyer). Aiden receives a promotion, which is in London, and asks Maria whether Marcus will travel with him. Maria attempts to terminate the thought of moving to London as Marcus will stay. Although, the couple later notice her trickery and agree to leave for London, upsetting Maria. Marcus angrily confronts her at the flat and unable to contain his feelings, they sleep together but after their steamy session, he rejects her. The taxi arrives to take Aiden and Marcus but he refuses to leave, lying that he still loves Sean and ends his relationship with Aiden, leading a heartbroken Aiden to leave for the capital alone. Marcus stuns Maria when she sees him still at the flat and after revealing he is in love with her, they kiss and start casually dating. She later declares to Jason that their relationship is over.\n\nIn late-2013, Marcus and Maria decide that they want to buy a house together, away from the street, so that there are things like boating lakes and playgrounds for Liam. After viewing a chain of properties, Marcus and Maria finally find a place with all the amenities that they were looking for. Marcus then decides to surprise Maria at the show home, and as he waits for her, their gay friend Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) accompanies Marcus, but the pair end up having sex. Maria and her friend Audrey walk in on them, which leaves Marcus horrified and embarrassed. As Marcus tries to explain himself to Maria and put things right with her, she lashes out, attacks him, and ends their relationship for good. Maria kicks Marcus out of their flat, but Maria is annoyed when he is offered a room at Todd's aunt Julie's flat. When Liam's childminder falls sick, and Maria does not answer her phone, Marcus decides to pick Liam up from the childminder's house, as no one else can. After picking Liam up, Marcus brings him back to the salon to meet Maria. Marcus tries to tell Maria that he is going to London for a short time, and Maria tells him that she wants nothing else to do with him. When Marcus returns, Maria was furious. After finding out that Tyrone's ex-fiancée Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede) has been released from prison, Maria comforts Tyrone and decided to try to rekindle their relationship by sending texts, pretending to be Kirsty (with the letter \"K\" at the end). Tyrone and Fiz's relationship starts to strain because of the texts and Fiz calling the police on her. When Maria gets Tyrone to herself for half an hour on the bench, she sees Fiz and deliberately hugs him in the hope that Fiz will dump him. Fiz moves out of Tyrone's house and moves back in with her brother Chesney. The next day, the police come knocking to Fiz and she found out that Kirsty is abroad and there is proof that the messages have come from the UK. Confused, Fiz rings the number and Tyrone picks it up and realizes that Maria was behind it all along. Maria tries to explain that she loves Tyrone and desperately tries to convince him that he feels the same, but a furious Tyrone pushes her away and tells her to stay away from them. The next day, Tyrone and Fiz call the police and Maria is arrested. The police then say that whatever happens next is up to Tyrone and Fiz. After some persuasion from Kirk, they decide to drop the charges. Maria then decides to take Liam to Cyprus for a while, so that he can spend a bit of time with his grandparents.\n\nMaria returns on 30 June, saying that being away helped her come to terms with what happened with Marcus and has helped her overall mental health. She and Kirk go to the Rovers for a drink where they bump into Fiz. Maria tries to apologise to Fiz for sending the texts to Tyrone and for frightening them. Fiz tells Maria that she will never forgive her for what she did. Marcus comes to Maria's defence and tells Fiz that Maria was obviously not well when she was doing those things and was therefore not herself. Marcus later catches Todd kissing another man to which had stayed the night before at Todd's house. Marcus is horrified and realises what Todd is really like. Marcus then dumps Todd and Maria comforts him. Marcus later leaves Weatherfield departing on good terms with Maria.\n\nShe later begins a relationship with mechanic Luke Britton (Dean Fagan). Maria is initially reluctant to commit to Luke. He later accompanies her to a wedding and they begin a serious relationship. Maria also likes Luke as he gets along well with Liam. Maria later gets into an argument with Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews) and is stunned when Jenny slaps her. She is later annoyed when Jenny denies hitting her, however, Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) believes Maria. She later buys Luke a stock racing car as a gift. He restores the car as it is not in good condition and later begins racing the car. She regrets buying him the racing car after she realises it could put his life in danger as he previously had an accident before he met Maria. Luke agrees to give up racing, but continues to race in secret. Maria later finds out that Luke is still racing the car after Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) lets slip that he saw Luke loading the car onto a trailer, while assumed to be working by Maria. Maria is furious when she finds out and later gives Luke an ultimatum either he gives up the racing or they're over. Luke later agrees to give up racing the car but is later blackmailed by his friend and sister's ex-boyfriend, Jamie Bowman (James Atherton) over naked photos he has of Luke's sister, Steph Britton (Tisha Merry). Maria later leaves the street for Cyprus in order to help her father Eric, look after her mother who has had an accident. Maria returns in April 2016 and it becomes obvious she is keeping a secret, whilst at the salon she takes a phone call from a man called Pablo, who she has married, Audrey later spots them kissing after he turns up outside her flat however Maria later reveals she only married Pablo to keep him in the country as he has a boyfriend living in the UK. In July 2016, she invites Caz Hammond (Rhea Bailey) to come and live with her and Luke which he becomes jealous by. Maria later has sex with Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward), who is dating Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) and still wants to continue the affair but Aidan doesn't as he has heard the Fiz calling her 'Mad Maria' and the factory girls saying that she's crazy. They are nearly caught out after Caz accidentally mentions that she saw Aidan in the flat the night before whereas he had told a lie to Eva. Eva questioned them both and Maria makes up that Aidan is looking at flats for her. This irritates Aidan as he doesn't want to move in with her and he and Maria argue. Maria then ends her engagement with Luke, which also devastates him. Later on back at the flat, Caz tells Liam that Maria and Luke are no longer together which infuriates Maria. Caz questions Maria whether she and Aidan had something going on and Maria orders Caz out. After Maria manages to get Caz a job interview Caz kisses her, Maria then tells Audrey and Sophie about the kiss and Caz overhears this and leaves the street. Maria and Sophie, however, go after her and manage to bring her back.\n\nIn October 2016, Caz tells Tyrone that Maria is threatening her to get out of the flat and goes missing framing Maria for \"murdering her\" by putting blood on the walls, Maria is questioned by the police however the rest of the street including Tyrone back Maria but Caz is nowhere to be seen. Tyrone and Fiz later find Maria's rug with blood stains on in the bin and tell the police, the police question Maria. After coming back from the police station Maria and Aidan hug unaware that Caz is watching in the distance. Maria later goes into the pub whilst everyone is talking about her and lashes out at pregnant Michelle Connor. Caz cuts herself in Maria's flat and wipes the blood on Maria's hairdressing scissors. Maria later finds these and with Aidan's help they dispose of them. However, Aidan's father Johnny Connor (Richard Hawley) finds them and alerts the police, which leads to Maria being arrested. Maria is released after Aidan's sister and Caz's ex-girlfriend Kate Connor (Faye Brookes) leads Caz to believe she wants her back and rings the police. Aidan goes to pick Maria up from the police station and they nearly kiss. Aidan then later confesses that he loves Maria despite his relationship with Eva. However, on Christmas Eve, Maria is sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for illegally marrying Pablo.\n\nIn March 2017, she is released from prison for good behaviour but with an electronic tracking device on her ankle. She reunites and clashes with Toyah due to their feud fourteen years earlier. In May 2017, she accompanies Aidan to a business lunch where she pretends to be Eva however she needs to get home before her curfew ends and storms out of the restaurant after an argument with Aidan. She is seen walking alongside the road by Aidan who tempts her into his car for a lift home as she doesn't want to go back to prison. Once they get back to Maria's just in time before her curfew ends they have sex and afterwards she tells him he can stay with Eva and that they can carry on having an affair behind her back but Maria is heartbroken when he and Eva get engaged, and although at first she insists their affair is over; Maria carries on secretly meeting Aidan. He ends the affair once Eva tells Aidan she is pregnant. Eva annoys Maria and asks her to plan her wedding. Eva starts humiliating Maria at her hen party, where she learns that Eva has lied about her pregnancy when Maria finds her fake baby scans. After lying saying she cannot go to the wedding, Maria sneaks to the hotel instead and puts a picture of the fake scans in the guests gift bags, however after being locked in the bathroom by Toyah, Maria manages to be let out by hotel staff and storms into the ceremony exposing Eva's fake pregnancy to Aidan and the rest of the wedding guests.\n\nEva desperately tries to deny it, but eventually admits that she found out about the affair months ago. Despite her attempts to shame him and Maria, Aidan is disgusted with her deception and storms out of the wedding ceremony. Whilst outside, Eva attacks Maria and the pair end up in a fountain until they are eventually broken up by Kirk. A few days later, Aidan makes a move on Maria following his break up with Eva but she rebuffs him, saying he's not allowed to pick and choose. Aidan commits suicide in May 2018 and Maria is devastated, especially after how close he became with Liam in his final weeks, including giving him his watch to look after.\n\nMaria falls out with Audrey when she refuses to give her any independence at work, and eventually, a heated argument leads to Maria quitting her job at the salon. She is approached by Audrey's competitor, Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska), who offers Maria the chance to invest in and run her own salon which she quickly agrees to. Maria struggles to raise the funds for the investment and is surprised when Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) offers her the money in return for a share of the profits. Maria celebrates with Claudia, Rita and her new housemate Emma Brooker (Alexandra Mardell), whom she had just offered a room to. Maria eventually pulls out of the deal when Claudia attempts to cruelly humiliate Audrey at the annual Hair Salon Awards, which had resulted in a drunken Audrey throwing flowers at Claudia. She has a heart-to-heart with Audrey where she tells Maria that she has always been like a daughter to her, and they make up with the agreement that Maria would become a partner in the salon.\n\nIn December 2019, she discovers she’s pregnant with Gary Windass’s baby, only to have a miscarriage soon after.\n\nMaria was created as a love interest for Tyrone Dobbs, and first appeared working as a kennel maid at her parents' kennels. Auditions were held for the role in 2000, and actress Samia Ghadie beat several rivals, including singers Kimberley Walsh (of Girls Aloud) and Suzanne Shaw (of Hear'Say), to win the part. Describing Maria's development as a character since her arrival on \"Coronation Street\", the official website states: \"Maria has blossomed from working as a kennel maid to one of the Street's most glamorous young women. She laps up the male attention that her good looks bring her but playing footloose and fancy-free with the men in her life has gained her a bit of a reputation.\" Jenny Cockle, writing for the \"Sunday Mirror\", has similarly observed that during the character's duration on the show, Maria has evolved from a \"dowdy kennel maid\" to a \"sexy siren\". Reflecting on her early days at the programme, Ghadie said: \"I thought I'd do my three months and then I'd be off. I was a jobbing actress when I joined and was really pleased to have a job for three months. I never imagined I'd still be here now.\" Since her arrival at \"Coronation Street\" Samia Smith has revealed that she will always be grateful for the opportunities she has been given since she joined. In 2012, Ghadie revealed that she would like to stay at \"Coronation Street\" for another ten years, she said to \"OK! magazine\": \"I'd be very happy if I was still in Corrie in ten years' time. I think because of everything that has happened in the last few years I'm trying not to plan too much ahead. I am happy for each day\". She also confirmed that she had signed another contract that would keep her in the show til September 2013. Ghadie revealed that it does not feel like she has been on the show for 12 years: \"I'm 30 in July so it's quite scary, really! I was 17 when I joined so it just feels like my life is going really quickly! When I first joined, I was on a three-month contract. I thought I'd do my three months and then I'd be off. I was a jobbing actress when I joined and was really pleased to have a job for three months. I never imagined I'd still be here now, but I'm still really enjoying it. I think the show is going from strength to strength and it's got a brilliant mix of comedy and drama at the moment. For once, I'm involved in the lighter-hearted stuff, so that's nice!\"\n\nDiscussing if Maria and Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) could get back together, she said: \"She could save him from Kirsty, couldn't she? I really love working with Alan Halsall, who plays Tyrone, because he's like a brother in real life. I've known him forever so it's always good working with him, and I do love Maria and Tyrone scenes.\" Commenting on the relationship between Maria, Liam and Carla prior to Maria and Liam's wedding, Smith assessed: \"I think Liam loves Maria but he is in lust with Carla.\"\n\nAsked how she felt about Maria's romance with Tony Gordon, the man responsible for Liam's death, Smith commented: \"It's freaked me out to be honest! It is a bit creepy, we can't deny that, considering everything that's happened between them! I think the writers have done a brilliant job in making it a slow burner and making it as realistic as possible to allow them to fall for each other. They have actually got quite a bit in common. They've both had their hearts broken by two people who they were very close to and considered the loves of their lives. Ultimately, they've forgotten everything that went on earlier this year with the accusations of murder and everything - that's all been brushed under the carpet..\" Commenting on Maria's relationship with Tony, Smith said: \"I think Maria genuinely loved Tony. I don't think she feels anything but hatred for him now. She's quite sad thinking about what might have been with him because she actually thought she'd got it all sussed - that she was going to be with him and he was going to be a father to Liam. Her world ended when she found out that he'd murdered her husband.\"\n\nIn 2012, Maria began a relationship with ex-boyfriend Jason Grimshaw played by Ryan Thomas, Thomas praised the plot: “She was one of the first girls he ever went out with. I think he's just done a big round circle and come back. It's been great, I've enjoyed working on it. They've got all the right qualities to last as a couple but you just do not know. Couples do not seem to last too long on Corrie and if they do, there's always things that get in the way of relationships in soaps, so we'll wait and see.” Ghadie revealed that filming the scenes with Thomas was more awkward than romantic as she and Thomas are good friends and revealed that it was like kissing your brother.\n\nDiscussing the scenes in which Maria give birth to a stillborn son, Smith described the research she put into filming the storyline to ensure authenticity: \"It was so important that I got it right and it wasn't too overdramatic. They were both the hardest and easiest scenes I've ever had to do, because the situation was so sad. I was absolutely emotionally drained at the end of it all. The midwife has a lot of experience of attending stillbirths, and she helped me work out how to play it so that it seems real. It scared me personally, though, because the idea of going through something like that is petrifying. They were the most challenging scenes I've ever done.\"\n\nOn filming the delivery scene itself, she explained; \"There was a prosthetic baby, but the director didn't show it to me until filming started so I'd get the full impact. It looked so real and I just broke down.\" Smith also gave the insight that filming the storyline affected her on a personal level, leading to the discovery her own mother had gone through the same situation: \"Because of my mum, I wanted to do the scenes well but they left me feeling exhausted and drained. I know mum will be watching it at home, as will thousands of women who've been through it so I need to do it justice for them.\" In an interview for the Inside Soap Year book 2009, a point was made about the fact nothing nice seems to happen to the character and asked Samia about it, she replied \"I'd love Maria to be happy for a change! I sometimes wonder if the Corrie scriptwriters think I've got a dodgy smile or something, because Maria hasn't smiled for months\".\n\nIn February 2011, It was reported that Kym Marsh who played Michelle Connor was to be written out due to her pregnancy, forcing re-writes to the script instead of Michelle, Maria became involved with Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel). It was reported that Maria would be a victim of a sexual attack by Frank; a \"Coronation Street\" source revealed: \"Time will tell how bad Frank's character will be - but he's a ladies' man and no Weatherfield woman will be safe from his interest. Samia Smith revealed that the storyline would be very dramatic and there would be plenty of tears. Smith also revealed that Maria faces a horrible dilemma, she told \"All About Soap\" magazine: \"She's absolutely terrified. He starts groping her all over and has his hand up her thigh. He basically tries to rape her but she manages to struggle out of his grip and runs from the house screaming and petrified.\" Smith noted that she was worried about offending people with the storyline: \"A few years ago my first kind of hard-hitting storyline was when Maria had the stillborn baby and it sort of makes you really hyper-aware that other people have been through it, so you kind of want to do it justice. It's the same with this one really. Sexual assault is a very serious issue, so I want to do it justice and hopefully not offend people who have been sexually assaulted.\n\nIn August 2016, it was reported that Maria's current lodger Caz Hammond would hatch her most twisted plan yet as she uses Maria's recent encounter with a burglar to her own advantage. The incident leaves Maria with a nasty injury when she falls and hits her head as the intruder flees, but there's a coincidence when Caz soon shows up and rescues her. Caz deals with the situation perfectly as she tends to Maria's wound and calls the police to report the burglary, then agrees to stay over for the night to keep an eye on Maria. Rhea Bailey, who plays Caz, revealed: \"Caz is just grateful that she can be there to mop up the aftermath and be a shoulder to cry on for Maria. In some twisted way, I think Caz feels like the hero. She just happened to be around the Street when Maria was burgled. She is sad that this meant Maria had to get hurt, but she's secretly really happy that she can be around and help Maria get over this.\"\n\nMaria marries Pablo, who is gay, in order for him to gain a visa. In December 2016, she was consequently imprisoned for 12 months. She was released from prison in March 2017.\n\nIn 2006, the character won the \"Inside Soap\" 'Best Dressed' accolade. Grace Dent, writing for \"The Guardian\", has been highly critical of Maria during her time on the show. In February 2006, she highlighted the unlikeliness of Maria's relationship with Tyrone Dobbs is very romantic\n, writing: \"Maria Sutherland is one of those shiny, lithe, capricious, tidily-kept hairdresser girls who flutter around the Trafford Centre's Karen Millen store on Saturdays, trying on sparkly halter frocks, dreaming about snaring Rio Ferdinand. Tyrone Dobbs, on the other hand, looks like one of the Flumps.\" Following the death of Charlie Stubbs in January 2007, she deemed Maria to be the Street's \"local loose-knickered simpleton\", and has also referred to her as being \"such a tit\", and \"a pretty, perky, easily beddable dimwit\". A writer from \"TV Magazine\" noted that most of Maria's men end up dead and quipped \"Maria is the Street's unlikely black widow and her men often have a bleak future.\" In August 2017, Longchambon was longlisted for Best Bad Girl at the Inside Soap Awards. She did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1892375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892375", "title": "James Bonham", "text": "James Bonham\n\nJames Bonham (February 20, 1807 – March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American soldier who died at the Battle of the Alamo during the Texas Revolution. He was a second cousin of Travis and was a messenger of the Battle of the Alamo. His younger brother, Milledge Luke Bonham, was a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War, and served as Governor of South Carolina from 1862 to 1864.\n\nBonham was born, along with his sibling (Milledge Luke Bonham) in the Redbank area (present day Lexington County, South Carolina) on February 20, 1807. The son of James and Sophia Butler (Smith) Bonham.\n\nBonham entered South Carolina College in 1824. In 1827, in his senior year, he led a student protest over harsh attendance regulations and the poor food served at the college boardinghouse. He was expelled, along with the entire senior class. In 1830, Bonham practiced law in Pendleton, but was found in contempt of court after caning an attorney who had insulted one of Bonham's clients. When ordered to apologize by the sitting judge, he refused and threatened to tweak the judge’s nose. Bonham was sentenced to ninety days for contempt of court.\n\nHe served as an aide to Governor James Hamilton Jr. during the Nullification Crisis in 1832. Bonham brandished a sword and pistol, condemning Andrew Jackson and the Washington politicians. His outspoken position brought him the rank of lieutenant colonel. At the same time he served as captain of a Charleston artillery company.\n\nIn October 1834, Bonham moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where relatives lived. The following year he went to Mobile, where he helped organize a company of militia cavalry called the \"Mobile Greys\" to serve in Texas. The company reached San Felipe, Texas in November 1835, and Bonham was commissioned a lieutenant in the Texian Cavalry on December 3.\n\nOn December 1, 1835, he wrote to Sam Houston from San Felipe volunteering his services for Texas and declining all pay, lands, or rations in return. In December 1835, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Texas cavalry, but apparently was not assigned to any specific unit. He had time to set up a law practice in Brazoria and was advertising the fact in the Telegraph and Texas Register by January 2, 1836.\n\nBonham and Houston quickly developed a mutual admiration. After being in Texas for only one month Bonham recommended to Houston that William S. Blount of North Carolina be granted a commission as a captain in the Texas cavalry. On January 11, 1836, Houston recommended to James W. Robinson that Bonham be promoted to major, for \"His influence in the army is great, more so than some who `would be generals'.\" Bonham probably traveled to San Antonio de Béxar and the Alamo with James Bowie and arrived on January 19, 1836. On January 26 he was appointed one of a committee of seven to draft a preamble and resolutions on behalf of the garrison in support of Governor Henry Smith. On February 1 he was an unsuccessful candidate in the election of delegates to represent the Bexar garrison at the Texas constitutional convention.\n\nHe was sent by Travis to obtain aid for the garrison at Bexar on about February 16, 1836. He visited Goliad, but the commander of the forces there, James Fannin, was unable to provide assistance. Bonham's inimitable spirit is best described by T.R. Fehrenbach in his Texas opus, Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans: \"\"At the end, the weary Bonham, a lawyer, a Carolinian of exulted family and a friend of Travis, turned his mount around and rode back toward San Antonio. He was told it was useless to throw away his life. He answered back that Buck Travis deserved to know the answer to his appeals, spat upon the ground, and galloped west into his own immortality.\" Thus, Bonham returned to the Alamo on March 3, bearing through the Mexican lines a letter from Robert McAlpin Williamson assuring Travis that help was on its way and urging him to hold out. Bonham died in the battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. James Bonham was 29 at the time, he is believed to have died manning one of the cannons in the interior of the Alamo chapel.\n\nThe town of Bonham, Texas, is named for him. Bonham is the county seat of Fannin County, named for the commander who Bonham tried to enjoin for assistance at the Alamo. A 1936 Texas Centennial Marker was placed on the courthouse square in the city of Bonham. The monument displays a statue of Bonham by Texas sculptor Allie Tennant. Many Texas schools are named after James Bonham, for example, in the cities of Abilene, Amarillo, Bryan, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, McAllen, Midland, Odessa, San Angelo, San Antonio, and Temple.\n\n\"Flat Grove,\" Bonham's home in Saluda, is the only known birthplace of an Alamo defender still in existence. It is maintained as a museum.\nTexas A&M University and Bonham's alma mater, the University of South Carolina began an SEC cross-divisional rivalry in 2014 with both schools competing for the Bonham trophy.\n\n\n Theo Chau 2012\n\n"}
{"id": "1892376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892376", "title": "MHC class I", "text": "MHC class I\n\nMHC class I molecules are one of two primary classes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (the other being MHC class II) and are found on the cell surface of all nucleated cells in the bodies of vertebrates. They also occur on platelets, but not on red blood cells. Their function is to display peptide fragments of proteins from within the cell to cytotoxic T cells; this will trigger an immediate response from the immune system against a particular non-self antigen displayed with the help of an MHC class I protein. Because MHC class I molecules present peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, the pathway of MHC class I presentation is often called \"cytosolic\" or \"endogenous pathway\".\n\nIn humans, the HLAs corresponding to MHC class I are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C.\n\nClass I MHC molecules bind peptides generated mainly from degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome. The MHC I:peptide complex is then inserted via endoplasmic reticulum into the external plasma membrane of the cell. The epitope peptide is bound on extracellular parts of the class I MHC molecule. Thus, the function of the class I MHC is to display intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). However, class I MHC can also present peptides generated from exogenous proteins, in a process known as cross-presentation.\n\nA normal cell will display peptides from normal cellular protein turnover on its class I MHC, and CTLs will not be activated in response to them due to central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. When a cell expresses foreign proteins, such as after viral infection, a fraction of the class I MHC will display these peptides on the cell surface. Consequently, CTLs specific for the MHC:peptide complex will recognize and kill presenting cells.\n\nAlternatively, class I MHC itself can serve as an inhibitory ligand for natural killer cells (NKs). Reduction in the normal levels of surface class I MHC, a mechanism employed by some viruses and certain tumors to evade CTL responses, activates NK cell killing.\n\nPaired-immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), an MHCI-binding receptor, is involved in the regulation of visual plasticity. PirB is expressed in the central nervous system and diminishes ocular dominance plasticity in the developmental critical period and adulthood. When the function of PirB was abolished in mutant mice, ocular dominance plasticity became more pronounced at all ages. PirB loss of function mutant mice also exhibited enhanced plasticity after monocular deprivation during the critical period. These results suggest PirB may be involved in modulation of synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex.\n\nMHC class I molecules are heterodimers that consist of two polypeptide chains, α and β-microglobulin (B2M). The two chains are linked noncovalently via interaction of B2M and the α domain. Only the α chain is polymorphic and encoded by a HLA gene, while the B2M subunit is not polymorphic and encoded by the Beta-2 microglobulin gene. The α domain is plasma membrane-spanning and interacts with the CD8 co-receptor of T-cells. The α-CD8 interaction holds the MHC I molecule in place while the T cell receptor (TCR) on the surface of the cytotoxic T cell binds its α-α heterodimer ligand, and checks the coupled peptide for antigenicity. The α and α domains fold to make up a groove for peptides to bind. MHC class I molecules bind peptides that are predominantly 8-10 amino acid in length (Parham 87), but the binding of longer peptides have also been reported.\n\nThe peptides are generated mainly in the cytosol by the proteasome. The proteasome is a macromolecule that consists of 28 subunits, of which half affect proteolytic activity. The proteasome degrades intracellular proteins into small peptides that are then released into the cytosol. Proteasomes can also ligate distinct peptide fragments (termed spliced peptides), producing sequences that are noncontiguous and therefore not linearly templated in the genome. The origin of spliced peptide segments can be from the same protein (cis-splicing) or different proteins (trans-splicing). The peptides have to be translocated from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to meet the MHC class I molecule, whose peptide-binding site is in the lumen of the ER. They have membrane proximal Ig fold\n\nThe peptide translocation from the cytosol into the lumen of the ER is accomplished by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). TAP is a member of the ABC transporter family and is a heterodimeric multimembrane-spanning polypeptide consisting of TAP1 and TAP2. The two subunits form a peptide binding site and two ATP binding sites that face the cytosol. TAP binds peptides on the cytoplasmic side and translocates them under ATP consumption into the lumen of the ER. The MHC class I molecule is then, in turn, loaded with peptides in the lumen of the ER.\n\nThe peptide-loading process involves several other molecules that form a large multimeric complex called the Peptide loading complex consisting of TAP, tapasin, calreticulin, calnexin, and Erp57 (PDIA3). Calnexin acts to stabilize the class I MHC α chains prior to β2m binding. Following complete assembly of the MHC molecule, calnexin dissociates. The MHC molecule lacking a bound peptide is inherently unstable and requires the binding of the chaperones calreticulin and Erp57. Additionally, tapasin binds to the MHC molecule and serves to link it to the TAP proteins and facilitates the selection of peptide in an iterative process called peptide editing, thus facilitating enhanced peptide loading and colocalization.\n\nOnce the peptide is loaded onto the MHC class I molecule, the complex dissociates and it leaves the ER through the secretory pathway to reach the cell surface. The transport of the MHC class I molecules through the secretory pathway involves several posttranslational modifications of the MHC molecule. Some of the posttranslational modifications occur in the ER and involve change to the N-glycan regions of the protein, followed by extensive changes to the N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus. The N-glycans mature fully before they reach the cell surface.\n\nPeptides that fail to bind MHC class I molecules in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are removed from the ER via the sec61 channel into the cytosol, where they might undergo further trimming in size, and might be translocated by TAP back into ER for binding to a MHC class I molecule.\n\nFor example, an interaction of sec61 with bovine albumin has been observed.\n\nMHC class I molecules are loaded with peptides generated from the degradation of ubiquitinated cytosolic proteins in proteasomes. As viruses induce cellular expression of viral proteins, some of these products are tagged for degradation, with the resulting peptide fragments entering the endoplasmic reticulum and binding to MHC I molecules. It is in this way, the MHC class I-dependent pathway of antigen presentation, that the virus infected cells signal T-cells that abnormal proteins are being produced as a result of infection.\n\nThe fate of the virus-infected cell is almost always induction of apoptosis through cell-mediated immunity, reducing the risk of infecting neighboring cells. As an evolutionary response to this method of immune surveillance, many viruses are able to down-regulate or otherwise prevent the presentation of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. In contrast to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells are normally inactivated upon recognizing MHC I molecules on the surface of cells. Therefore, in the absence of MHC I molecules, NK cells are activated and recognize the cell as aberrant, suggesting that it may be infected by viruses attempting to evade immune destruction. Several human cancers also show down-regulation of MHC I, giving transformed cells the same survival advantage of being able to avoid normal immune surveillance designed to destroy any infected or transformed cells.\n\n\nThe MHC class I genes originated in the most recent common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates, and have been found in all living jawed vertebrates that have been studied thus far. Since their emergence in jawed vertebrates, this gene family has been subjected to many divergent evolutionary paths as speciation events have taken place. There are, however, documented cases of trans-species polymorphisms in MHC class I genes, where a particular allele in an evolutionary related MHC class I gene remains in two species, likely due to strong pathogen-mediated balancing selection by pathogens that can infect both species. Birth-and-death evolution is one of the mechanistic explanations for the size of the MHC class I gene family.\n\nBirth-and-death evolution asserts that gene duplication events cause the genome to contain multiple copies of a gene which can then undergo separate evolutionary processes. Sometimes these processes result in pseudogenization (death) of one copy of the gene, though sometimes this process results in two new genes with divergent function. It is likely that human MHC class Ib loci (HLA-E, -F, and -G) as well as MHC class I pseudogenes arose from MHC class Ia loci (HLA-A, -B, and -C) in this birth-and-death process.\n\n"}

In his career, he performed in North America, Europe, and Japan under a variety of gimmicks, including in multiple stints in World Championship Wrestling as Rage as one half of the team The Wrecking Crew with Fury, Blade as one half of the Master Blasters with Steel, and finally as a singles wrestler as The Dog.\n\nGreen was trained for a professional wrestling career by Steve Keirn, making his debut in 1990 as Blade, one half of The Master Blasters tag team alongside Kevin Nash.\n\nOn September 22, 1990 Blade was a replacement for Iron, who left World Championship Wrestling after only one match. The reconstituted Master Blasters continued their undefeated streak in October. Meanwhile, Kevin Nash would have his first singles match on September 28, defeating Tom Zenk in Baltimore, Maryland. At Halloween Havoc on October 27, 1990, in Chicago, Illinois the Blasters upended The Southern Boys and began to move up the WCW tag-team ratings. However their winning streak would finally come to an end on November 22 at the Omni in Atlanta, Georgia when Tom Zenk & Brian Pillman handed them their first defeat (Pillman pinning Blade). They rebounded to go on another undefeated streak, defeating The Southern Boys as well as Alan Iron Eagle & Tim Horner and earning a US Tag-Team title shot against the champions The Steiner Brothers. The Steiners however were victorious in matches on December 25 and December 26.\n\nThey were pinned as well on television in 52 seconds by the Steiners in a match that aired on \"WCW Worldwide\" on February 2, 1991. Following this loss their momentum began to dissipate as the Blasters would suffer follow-up losses to the Southern Boys and Ricky Morton and Tommy Rich. The team disbanded at the end of the month, with Nash briefly continuing to wrestle simply as \"The Master Blaster\" until being given the new gimmick of \"Oz\" in May 1991. Meanwhile, Green would leave WCW to compete for Florida Championship Wrestling in The Bounty Hunters tag team as Bounty Hunter #1. The team won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in November, but when Green's partner (Tim Parker) was injured, The Terminator stepped in and defended the tag team titles with Green. The team held the gold until the Nasty Boys beat them on a card in Nassau, Bahamas on January 6, 1991.\n\nWhile the team with The Terminator was a makeshift team at first, but they began teaming regularly first under the name The Terminators then later on as The Wrecking Crew where the Terminator became known as Fury and Al was renamed Rage. The team competed for the International Wrestling Federation based in Florida showing themselves to be a force in the tag team division. On May 28, 1992, the duo beat IWF Tag Team Champions The Long Riders (Brett Colt and Kip Winchester).\n\nBy late 1992 the Wrecking Crew got signed by World Championship Wrestling, making their debut in January 1993. Shortly after their debut the Wrecking Crew got national exposure by competing at Clash of the Champions XXII on January 13 where they defeated Tom Zenk and Johnny Gunn.\n\nAfter their success at the Clash the team rode on a wave of success defeating Gunn and Zenk repeatedly, as well as looking impressive against temporary teams such as 2 Cold Scorpio and Johnny B. Badd, and Marcus Bagwell and Joey Maggs.\n\nBy March the team was contesting a series of matches with future WCW World Tag Team Champions 2 Cold Scorpio and Marcus Alexander Bagwell as well as feuding with the identical twin duo known as The Cole Twins (Keith and Kent Cole). The feud with the Cole Twins was soon expanded to also include Bagwell and Scorpio as well as Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce. As the feud wore on the Cole Twins got the upper hand in the feud over the two big men. The Wrecking Crew also faced Cactus Jack and The Barbarian in a series of house show matches.\n\nAs Summer turned to fall the Wrecking Crew’s time with WCW ended, returning to the independent scene. In 1994 the Wrecking Crew traveled to Europe to work for Otto Wanz’ Catch Wrestling Association. On July 24 they defeated David Finlay and John Hawk in the finals of a tournament to crown new CWA Tag Team Champions after Larry Cameron had died during a match. Fury and Rage held the belts for only three weeks before being unseated by CWA regulars August Smisl and Ulf Herman in Vienna, Austria.\n\nIn 1995 the Wrecking Crew toured with All Japan Pro Wrestling over the summer being put over young teams like Kentaro Shiga and Mannukea Mossman. The highlight of their summer tour was a clash with multiple time All Asia Tag Team Champions Doug Furnas and Dan Kroffat which the Wrecking Crew lost.\n\nGreen performed in WCW during the late 1990s, mainly on low level programs like \"WCW Saturday Night\". On August 31, 1998 he faced Goldberg in a losing effort in the co-main event of \"WCW Monday Nitro\". While doing guest commentary, Kevin Nash made reference to Green being a former tag team partner of his (also making a pun of his name, relating to the more famous singer Al Green). In 2000, he was repackaged as The Dog when he formed a hardcore tag team managed by Fit Finlay with former Nasty Boy Brian Knobs. Green's mannerisms in this gimmick were those of a stereotypical attack dog and would have habits not unlike dogs, including drinking from the toilet. He was a last minute replacement in their group for Sabu, who couldn't start for WCW due to contract issues. Upon the acquisition of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation in early 2001, Green's contract was one of the assets not taken.\n\nGreen's last television appearances were as a guest on the reality shows \"Hogan Knows Best\" and \"Brooke Knows Best\" on VH1.\n\nGreen died on June 14, 2013, at the age of 57. He had been suffering from COPD for some time before his death.\n\n"}

Additionally, he is a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision making body.\n\nIn his earlier political career, he served as the Communist Party Secretary of Qinghai, the party secretary of Shaanxi, and the head of the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China. He entered the Politburo in 2012, and was promoted to the Standing Committee five years later.\n\nZhao Leji was born in Xining, Qinghai province. His parents were from Xi'an, Shaanxi province. The family moved to Qinghai as part of the aid the frontiers programs of the Mao years. During the later years of the Cultural Revolution, Zhao went to the countryside to perform manual labour on a commune. After working there for about a year, Zhao returned to the city to become a communications assistant at the Commerce Department of Qinghai province.\n\nZhao joined the Communist Party in 1975 and entered Peking University in 1977 as a \"gongnongbing\" student; he studied philosophy there until January 1980. He then spent three years teaching at the Qinghai School of Commerce and overseeing the Communist Youth League wing of the provincial department of commerce. In 1985, he was transferred to a Qinghai-based metal products company to be its party chief. In April 1986, he became deputy head of the provincial department of commerce.\n\nZhao entered the provincial government in 1993, becoming part of the inner circle of then Qinghai party secretary Yin Kesheng. He was then elevated to vice-governor, then Communist Party Secretary of his hometown Xining. He acceded to the post of governor in 1999 at age 42, becoming the youngest provincial governor in the country at the time. Having 'jumped' several levels in a short period of time, Zhao's upward trajectory began to slow by the turn of the century. Zhao became party chief of Qinghai in 2003 after having spent nearly five years in the Governor's office. Part of his inability to move to a more economically prosperous and more politically visible province was attributed to his Shaanxi background. He spoke in Shaanxi dialect even at government meetings.\n\nZhao's tenure in Qinghai was marked by rapid economic growth, and a tripling of the province's GDP from the time he took office as Governor to when he left as party chief in 2007. It was said that Zhao took a relatively soft approach on ethnic minority issues and took on environmentally conscious investment projects. His achievements in Qinghai were lauded by the party's central leadership.\n\nIn 2007, Zhao was transferred to become party secretary in his parents' home province of Shaanxi, having taken on the top jobs in both his 'native' province and the province of his birth, breaking an unspoken rule in the Communist Party that party chiefs should never hail from the province they are native to. This was seen as an indication of the trust shown to Zhao by the central leadership. In 2008, Shaanxi's GDP growth figures hit 15%, becoming one of only two provincial-level divisions to set sights on GDP growth rates of over 13%. In Shaanxi, Zhao oversaw the expansion and development of the GuanZhong-TianShui(关中-天水) economic belt.\n\nAfter the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in November 2012, he was appointed member of the Politburo and head of the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China.\n\nZhao was a member of the 16th and 17th Central Committee and the 18th Politburo of the Communist Party of China.\n\nZhao was chosen to be a member of the 19th Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, at the 1st Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on 25 October 2017. In the same Session, he succeeded Wang Qishan to become the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's highest internal-control institution that has been noted for executing Xi's anti-corruption campaign.\n\n"}

{"id": "1892408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892408", "title": "Behaviour therapy", "text": "Behaviour therapy\n\nBehavior therapy or behavioral psychotherapy is a broad term referring to clinical psychotherapy that uses techniques derived from behaviorism. Those who practice behavior therapy tend to look at specific, learned behaviors and how the environment influences those behaviors. Those who practice behavior therapy are called behaviourists, or behavior analysts. They tend to look for treatment outcomes that are objectively measurable. Behavior therapy does not involve one specific method but it has a wide range of techniques that can be used to treat a person's psychological problems. Traditional behavior therapy draws from respondent conditioning and operant conditioning to solve patients problems.\n\nBehavioral psychotherapy is sometimes juxtaposed with cognitive psychotherapy, while cognitive behavioral therapy integrates aspects of both approaches.\n\nApplied behavior analysis (ABA) is the application of behavior analysis that focuses on assessing how environmental variables influence learning principles, particularly respondent and operant conditioning, to identify potential behavior-change procedures, which are frequently used throughout clinical therapy. Cognitive-behavior therapy views cognition and emotions as preceding overt behavior with treatment plans in psychotherapy to lessen the issue. Hallmark techniques of behaviour therapies are overlapping components of cognitive psychology, in addition to behaviour analytic principles of counterconditioning, punishment, habituation, and functional analysis (FA).\n\nA 2013 Cochrane review comparing behavior therapies to psychological therapies found them to be equally effective although at the time the evidence base that evaluates the benefits and harms of behavior therapies was felt to be weak.\n\nPrecursors of certain fundamental aspects of behaviour therapy have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly Stoicism. For example, Wolpe and Lazarus wrote,\nThe first use of the term behaviour modification appears to have been by Edward Thorndike in 1911. His article \"Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning\" makes frequent use of the term \"modifying behavior\". Through early research in the 1940s and the 1950s the term was used by Joseph Wolpe's research group. The experimental tradition in clinical psychology used it to refer to psycho-therapeutic techniques derived from empirical research. It has since come to refer mainly to techniques for increasing adaptive behaviour through reinforcement and decreasing maladaptive behaviour through extinction or punishment (with emphasis on the former). Two related terms are behaviour therapy and applied behaviour analysis. Since techniques derived from behavioural psychology tend to be the most effective in altering behaviour, most practitioners consider behaviour modification along with behaviour therapy and applied behaviour analysis to be founded in behaviourism. While behaviour modification and applied behaviour analysis typically uses interventions based on the same behavioural principles, many behaviour modifiers who are not applied behaviour analysts tend to use packages of interventions and do not conduct functional assessments before intervening.\n\nPossibly the first occurrence of the term \"behavior therapy\" was in a 1953 research project by B.F. Skinner, Ogden Lindsley, Nathan Azrin and Harry C. Solomon. The paper talked about operant conditioning and how it could be used to help improve the functioning of people who were diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia. Early pioneers in behaviour therapy include Joseph Wolpe and Hans Eysenck.\n\nIn general, behaviour therapy is seen as having three distinct points of origin: South Africa (Wolpe's group), The United States (Skinner), and the United Kingdom (Rachman and Eysenck). Each had its own distinct approach to viewing behaviour problems. Eysenck in particular viewed behaviour problems as an interplay between personality characteristics, environment, and behaviour. Skinner's group in the United States took more of an operant conditioning focus. The operant focus created a functional approach to assessment and interventions focused on contingency management such as the token economy and behavioural activation. Skinner's student Ogden Lindsley is credited with forming a movement called precision teaching, which developed a particular type of graphing program called the standard celeration chart to monitor the progress of clients. Skinner became interested in the individualising of programs for improved learning in those with or without disabilities and worked with Fred S. Keller to develop programmed instruction. Programmed instruction had some clinical success in aphasia rehabilitation. Gerald Patterson used programme instruction to develop his parenting text for children with conduct problems. (See Parent management training.) With age, respondent conditioning appears to slow but operant conditioning remains relatively stable. While the concept had its share of advocates and critics in the west, its introduction in the Asian setting, particularly in India in the early 1970s and its grand success were testament to the famous Indian psychologist H. Narayan Murthy's enduring commitment to the principles of behavioural therapy and biofeedback.\n\nWhile many behaviour therapists remain staunchly committed to the basic operant and respondent paradigm, in the second half of the 20th century, many therapists coupled behaviour therapy with the cognitive therapy, of Aaron Beck, Albert Ellis, and Donald Meichenbaum (psychologist)]]to form cognitive behaviour therapy. In some areas the cognitive component had an additive effect (for example, evidence suggests that cognitive interventions improve the result of social phobia treatment.) but in other areas it did not enhance the treatment, which led to the pursuit of third generation behaviour therapies. Third generation behaviour therapy uses basic principles of operant and respondent psychology but couples them with functional analysis and a clinical formulation/case conceptualisation of verbal behaviour more inline with view of the behaviour analysts. Some research supports these therapies as being more effective in some cases than cognitive therapy, but overall the question is still in need of answers.\n\nThe behavioural approach to therapy assumes that behaviour that is associated with psychological problems develops through the same processes of learning that affects the development of other behaviours. Therefore, behaviourists see personality problems in the way that personality was developed. They do not look at behaviour disorders as something a person has but that it reflects how learning has influenced certain people to behave in a certain way in certain situations.\n\nBehaviour therapy is based upon the principles of classical conditioning developed by Ivan Pavlov and operant conditioning developed by B.F. Skinner. Classical conditioning happens when a neutral stimulus comes right before another stimulus that triggers a reflexive response. The idea is that if the neutral stimulus and whatever other stimulus that triggers a response is paired together often enough that the neutral stimulus will produce the reflexive response. Operant conditioning has to do with rewards and punishments and how they can either strengthen or weaken certain behaviours.\n\nContingency management programs are a direct product of research from operant conditioning.\n\nBehavioral therapy based on operant and respondent principles has considerable evidence base to support its usage. This approach remains a vital area of clinical psychology and is often termed clinical behavior analysis. Behavioral psychotherapy has become increasingly contextual in recent years. Behavioral psychotherapy has developed greater interest in recent years in personality disorders as well as a greater focus on acceptance and complex case conceptualizations.\n\nOne current form of behavioral psychotherapy is functional analytic psychotherapy. Functional analytic psychotherapy is a longer duration behavior therapy. Functional analytic therapy focuses on in-session use of reinforcement and is primarily a relationally-based therapy. As with most of the behavioral psychotherapies, functional analytic psychotherapy is contextual in its origins and nature. and draws heavily on radical behaviorism and functional contextualism.\n\nFunctional analytic psychotherapy holds to a process model of research, which makes it unique compared to traditional behavior therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nFunctional analytic psychotherapy has a strong research support. Recent functional analytic psychotherapy research efforts are focusing on management of aggressive inpatients.\n\nBehaviour therapists complete a functional analysis or a functional assessment that looks at four important areas: stimulus, organism, response and consequences. The stimulus is the condition or environmental trigger that causes behaviour. An organism involves the internal responses of a person, like physiological responses, emotions and cognition. A response is the behaviour that a person exhibits and the consequences are the result of the behaviour. These four things are incorporated into an assessment done by the behaviour therapist.\n\nMost behaviour therapists use objective assessment methods like structured interviews, objective psychological tests or different behavioural rating forms. These types of assessments are used so that the behaviour therapist can determine exactly what a client's problem may be and establish a baseline for any maladaptive responses that the client may have. By having this baseline, as therapy continues this same measure can be used to check a client's progress, which can help determine if the therapy is working. Behaviour therapists do not typically ask the why questions but tend to be more focused on the how, when, where and what questions. Tests such as the Rorschach inkblot test or personality tests like the MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) are not commonly used for behavioural assessment because they are based on personality trait theory assuming that a person's answer to these methods can predict behaviour. Behaviour assessment is more focused on the observations of a persons behaviour in their natural environment.\n\nBehavioural assessment specifically attempts to find out what the environmental and self-imposed variables are. These variables are the things that are allowing a person to maintain their maladaptive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. In a behavioural assessment \"person variables\" are also considered. These \"person variables\" come from a person's social learning history and they affect the way in which the environment affects that person's behaviour. An example of a person variable would be behavioural competence. Behavioural competence looks at whether a person has the appropriate skills and behaviours that are necessary when performing a specific response to a certain situation or stimuli.\n\nWhen making a behavioural assessment the behaviour therapist wants to answer two questions: (1) what are the different factors (environmental or psychological) that are maintaining the maladaptive behaviour and (2) what type of behaviour therapy or technique that can help the individual improve most effectively. The first question involves looking at all aspects of a person, which can be summed up by the acronym BASIC ID. This acronym stands for behaviour, affective responses, sensory reactions, imagery, cognitive processes, interpersonal relationships and drug use.\n\nBehaviour therapy based its core interventions on functional analysis. Just a few of the many problems that behaviour therapy have functionally analysed include intimacy in couples relationships, forgiveness in couples, chronic pain, stress-related behaviour problems of being an adult child of an alcoholic, anorexia, chronic distress, substance abuse, depression, anxiety, insomnia and obesity.\n\nFunctional analysis has even been applied to problems that therapists commonly encounter like client resistance, partially engaged clients and involuntary clients. Applications to these problems have left clinicians with considerable tools for enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. One way to enhance therapeutic effectiveness is to use positive reinforcement or operant conditioning. Although behaviour therapy is based on the general learning model, it can be applied in a lot of different treatment packages that can be specifically developed to deal with problematic behaviours. Some of the more well known types of treatments are: Relaxation training, systematic desensitization, virtual reality exposure, exposure and response prevention techniques, social skills training, modeling, behavioural rehearsal and homework, and aversion therapy and punishment.\n\nRelaxation training involves clients learning to lower arousal to reduce their stress by tensing and releasing certain muscle groups throughout their body. Systematic desensitization is a treatment in which the client slowly substitutes a new learned response for a maladaptive response by moving up a hierarchy of situations involving fear. Systematic desensitization is based in part on counter conditioning. Counter conditioning is learning new ways to change one response for another and in the case of desensitization it is substituting that maladaptive behaviour for a more relaxing behaviour. Exposure and response prevention techniques (also known as flooding and response prevention) is the general technique in which a therapist exposes an individual to anxiety-provoking stimuli while keeping them from having any avoidance responses.\n\nVirtual reality therapy provides realistic, computer-based simulations of troublesome situations. The modeling process involves a person being subjected to watching other individuals who demonstrate behaviour that is considered adaptive and that should be adopted by the client. This exposure involves not only the cues of the \"model person\" as well as the situations of a certain behaviour that way the relationship can be seen between the appropriateness of a certain behaviour and situation in which that behaviour occurs is demonstrated. With the behavioural rehearsal and homework treatment a client gets a desired behaviour during a therapy session and then they practice and record that behaviour between their sessions. Aversion therapy and punishment is a technique in which an aversive (painful or unpleasant) stimulus is used to decrease unwanted behaviours from occurring. It is concerned with two procedures: 1) the procedures are used to decrease the likelihood of the frequency of a certain behaviour and 2) procedures that will reduce the attractiveness of certain behaviours and the stimuli that elicit them. The punishment side of aversion therapy is when an aversive stimulus is presented at the same time that a negative stimulus and then they are stopped at the same time when a positive stimulus or response is presented. Examples of the type of negative stimulus or punishment that can be used is shock therapy treatments, aversive drug treatments as well as response cost contingent punishment which involves taking away a reward.\n\nApplied behaviour analysis is using behavioural methods to modify certain behaviours that are seen as being important socially or personally. There are four main characteristics of applied behaviour analysis. First behaviour analysis is focused mainly on overt behaviours in an applied setting. Treatments are developed as a way to alter the relationship between those overt behaviours and their consequences.\n\nAnother characteristic of applied behaviour analysis is how it (behaviour analysis) goes about evaluating treatment effects. The individual subject is where the focus of study is on, the investigation is centered on the one individual being treated. A third characteristic is that it focuses on what the environment does to cause significant behaviour changes. Finally the last characteristic of applied behaviour analysis is the use of those techniques that stem from operant and classical conditioning such as providing reinforcement, punishment, stimulus control and any other learning principles that may apply.\n\nSocial skills training teaches clients skills to access reinforcers and lessen life punishment. Operant conditioning procedures in meta-analysis had the largest effect size for training social skills, followed by modelling, coaching, and social cognitive techniques in that order. Social skills training has some empirical support particularly for schizophrenia. However, with schizophrenia, behavioural programs have generally lost favor.\n\nSome other techniques that have been used in behaviour therapy are contingency contracting, response costs, token economies, biofeedback, and using shaping and grading task assignments.\n\nShaping and graded task assignments are used when behaviour that needs to be learned is complex. The complex behaviours that need to be learned are broken down into simpler steps where the person can achieve small things gradually building up to the more complex behaviour. Each step approximates the eventual goal and helps the person to expand their activities in a gradual way. This behaviour is used when a person feels that something in their lives can not be changed and life's tasks appear to be overwhelming.\n\nAnother technique of behaviour therapy involves holding a client or patient accountable of their behaviours in an effort to change them. This is called a contingency contract, which is a formal written contract between two or more people that defines the specific expected behaviours that you wish to change and the rewards and punishments that go along with that behaviour. In order for a contingency contract to be official it needs to have five elements. First it must state what each person will get if they successfully complete the desired behaviour. Secondly those people involved have to monitor the behaviours. Third, if the desired behaviour is not being performed in the way that was agreed upon in the contract the punishments that were defined in the contract must be done. Fourth if the persons involved are complying with the contract they must receive bonuses. The last element involves documenting the compliance and noncompliance while using this treatment in order to give the persons involved consistent feedback about the target behaviour and the provision of reinforcers.\n\nToken economies is a behaviour therapy technique where clients are reinforced with tokens that are considered a type of currency that can be used to purchase desired rewards, like being able to watch television or getting a snack that they want when they perform designated behaviours. Token economies are mainly used in institutional and therapeutic settings. In order for a token economy to be effective their must be consistency in administering the program by the entire staff. Procedures must be clearly defined so that there is no confusion among the clients. Instead of looking for ways to punish the patients or to deny them of rewards, the staff has to reinforce the positive behaviours so that the clients will increase the occurrence of the desired behaviour. Over time the tokens need to be replaced with less tangible rewards such as compliments so that the client will be prepared when they leave the institution and won't expect to get something every time they perform a desired behaviour.\n\nClosely related to token economies is a technique called response costs. This technique can either be used with or without token economies. Response costs is the punishment side of token economies where there is a loss of a reward or privilege after someone performs an undesirable behaviour. Like token economies this technique is used mainly in institutional and therapeutic settings.\n\nConsiderable policy implications have been inspired by behavioural views of various forms of psychopathology. One form of behaviour therapy, habit reversal training, has been found to be highly effective for treating tics.\n\nCurrently, there is a greater call for behavioral psychologists to be involved in rehabilitation efforts.\n\nTwo large studies done by the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University\nindicates that both behaviour therapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) are equally effective for OCD. CBT has been shown to perform slightly better at treating co-occurring depression.\n\nConsiderable policy implications have been inspired by behavioural views of various forms of psychopathology. One form of behaviour therapy (habit reversal training) has been found to be highly effective for treating tics.\n\nThere has been a development towards combining techniques to treat psychiatric disorders. Cognitive interventions are used to enhance the effects of more established behavioural interventions based on operant and classical conditioning. An increased effort has also been placed to address the interpersonal context of behaviour.\n\nBehaviour therapy can be applied to a number of mental disorders and in many cases is more effective for specific disorders as compared to others. Behaviour therapy techniques can be used to deal with any phobias that a person may have. Desensitization has also been applied to other issues such as dealing with anger, if a person has trouble sleeping and certain speech disorders. Desensitization does not occur over night, there is a process of treatment. Desensitization is done on a hierarchy and happens over a number of sessions. The hierarchy goes from situations that make a person less anxious or nervous up to things that are considered to be extreme for the patient.\n\nModeling has been used in dealing with fears and phobias. Modeling has been used in the treatment of fear of snakes as well as a fear of water.\n\nAversive therapy techniques have been used to treat sexual deviations as well as alcoholism.\n\nExposure and prevention procedure techniques can be used to treat people who have anxiety problems as well as any fears or phobias. These procedures have also been used to help people dealing with any anger issues as well as pathological grievers (people who have distressing thoughts about a deceased person).\n\nVirtual reality therapy deals with fear of heights, fear of flying, and a variety of other anxiety disorders. VRT has also been applied to help people with substance abuse problems reduce their responsiveness to certain cues that trigger their need to use drugs.\n\nShaping and graded task assignments has been used in dealing with suicide and depressed or inhibited individuals. This is used when a patient feel hopeless and they have no way of changing their lives. This hopelessness involves how the person reacts and responds to someone else and certain situations and their perceived powerlessness to change that situation that adds to the hopelessness. For a person with suicidal ideation, it is important to start with small steps. Because that person may perceive everything as being a big step, the smaller you start the easier it will be for the person to master each step. This technique has also been applied to people dealing with agoraphobia, or fear of being in public places or doing something embarrassing.\n\nContingency contracting has been used to deal with behaviour problems in delinquents and when dealing with on task behaviours in students.\n\nToken economies are used in controlled environments and are found mostly in psychiatric hospitals. They can be used to help patients with different mental illnesses but it doesn't focus on the treatment of the mental illness but instead on the behavioural aspects of a patient. The response cost technique has been used to address a variety of behaviours such as smoking, overeating, stuttering, and psychotic talk.\n\nSystematic desensitization has been shown to successfully treat phobias about heights, driving, insects as well as any anxiety that a person may have. Anxiety can include social anxiety, anxiety about public speaking as well as test anxiety. It has been shown that the use of systematic desensitization is an effective technique that can be applied to a number of problems that a person may have.\n\nWhen using modeling procedures this technique is often compared to another behavioural therapy technique. When compared to desensitization, the modeling technique does appear to be less effective. However it is clear that the greater the interaction between the patient and the subject he is modeling the greater the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nWhile undergoing exposure therapy a person usually needs five sessions to see if the treatment is working. After five sessions exposure treatment is seen to benefit the patient and help with their problems. However even after five sessions it is recommended that the patient or client should still continue treatment.\n\nVirtual Reality treatment has shown to be effective for a fear of heights. It has also been shown to help with the treatment of a variety of anxiety disorders. Virtual reality therapy can be very costly so therapists are still awaiting results of controlled trials for VR treatment to see which applications show the best results.\n\nFor those with suicidal ideation treatment depends on how severe the person's depression and feeling of hopelessness is. If these things are severe the person's response to completing small steps will not be of importance to them because they don't consider it to be a big deal. Generally those who aren't severely depressed or fearful, this technique has been successful because the completion of simpler activities build up their confidences and allows them to continue on to more complex situations.\n\nContingency contracts have been seen to be effective in changing any undesired behaviours of individuals. It has been seen to be effective in treating behaviour problems in delinquents regardless of the specific characteristics of the contract.\n\nToken economies have been shown to be effective when treating patients in psychiatric wards who had chronic schizophrenia. The results showed that the contingent tokens were controlling the behaviour of the patients.\n\nResponse costs has been shown to work in suppressing a variety of behaviours such as smoking, overeating or stuttering with a diverse group of clinical populations ranging from sociopaths to school children. These behaviours that have been suppressed using this technique often do not recover when the punishment contingency is withdrawn. Also undesirable side effects that are usually seen with punishment are not typically found when using the response cost technique.\n\nThe third-generation behaviour therapy movement has been called clinical behavior analysis because it represents a movement away from cognitivism and back toward radical behaviourism and other forms of behaviourism, in particular functional analysis and behavioural models of verbal behaviour. This area includes acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) (McCullough, 2000), behavioural activation (BA), functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP), integrative behavioural couples therapy and dialectical behavioural therapy. These approaches are squarely within the applied behaviour analysis tradition of behaviour therapy.\n\nACT may be the most well-researched of all the third-generation behaviour therapy models. It is based on relational frame theory. Other authors object to the term \"third generation\" or \"third wave\" and incorporate many of the \"third wave\" therapeutic techniques under the general umbrella term of modern cognitive behavioral therapies.\n\nFunctional analytic psychotherapy is based on a functional analysis of the therapeutic relationship. It places a greater emphasis on the therapeutic context and returns to the use of in-session reinforcement. In general, 40 years of research supports the idea that in-session reinforcement of behaviour can lead to behavioural change.\n\nBehavioural activation emerged from a component analysis of cognitive behaviour therapy. This research found no additive effect for the cognitive component. Behavioural activation is based on a matching model of reinforcement. A recent review of the research, supports the notion that the use of behavioural activation is clinically important for the treatment of depression.\n\nIntegrative behavioural couples therapy developed from dissatisfaction with traditional behavioural couples therapy. Integrative behavioural couples therapy looks to Skinner (1966) for the difference between contingency-shaped and rule-governed behaviour. It couples this analysis with a thorough functional assessment of the couple's relationship. Recent efforts have used radical behavioural concepts to interpret a number of clinical phenomena including forgiveness.\n\nMany organisations exist for behaviour therapists around the world. The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) provides accreditation for training programs in behaviour therapy. The ABAI has a special interest group for practitioner issues, behavioral counseling, and clinical behavior analysis ABA:I. ABAI has larger special interest groups for autism and its peculiar and narrow interpretation of behavioral medicine. ABAI serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts. ABAI sponsors two conferences/year – one in the U.S. and one international.\n\nIn the United States, the American Psychological Association's Division 25 is the division for behaviour analysis. The Association for Contextual Behavior Therapy is another professional organisation. ACBS is home to many clinicians with specific interest in third generation behaviour therapy. Doctoral-level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to American Psychological Association's division 25 – Behavior analysis. APA offers a diplomate in behavioral psychology.\n\nThe Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (formerly the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy) is for those with a more cognitive orientation. The ABCT also has an interest group in behavior analysis, which focuses on clinical behavior analysis. In addition, the Association for Behavioral an Cognitive Therapies has a special interest group on addictions.\n\nThe World Association for Behavior Analysis offers a certification in behavior therapy .\n\nBy nature, behavioural therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused on the environment and context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behaviour ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behaviour as statistically predictable), monistic (rejecting mind–body dualism and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analysing bidirectional interactions).\n\nBehavioural therapy develops, adds and provides behavioural intervention strategies and programs for clients, and training to people who care to facilitate successful lives in the communities.\n\nRecent efforts in behavioral psychotherapy have focused on the supervision process. A key point of behavioral models of supervision is that the supervisory process parallels the behavioral psychotherapy.\n\n"}

The Uzbek government has designated and banned Akromiya as terrorist.\n\nYo‘ldoshev is a native of Andijan, Uzbekistan and was trained as an engineer. He worked as a math teacher and for a furniture company in Andijan, before forming Akromiya. In 1992 he published \"Iymonga Yul\", a pamphlet advocating Islamic values that gained him support among the populace. Uzbek police arrested him in April, 1998 for possession of narcotics. A court sentenced him to 30 months imprisonment, but the government released him in December 1998 due to an amnesty.\n\nPolice arrested him in February 1999, the day after the 1999 Tashkent bombings that killed 16 people, accusing him of involvement. A court sentenced him to 17 years imprisonment for heading Akromiya.\n\nCritics of the Uzbek government doubt that he is guilty of the charges against him. Scott Horton of the Columbia Law School has said \"There's nothing that involves a challenge to government.\" Alisher Ilkhamov, an Uzbek who is a sociologist at the University of London, said \"The government perceives any grass-roots movement with hostility, whether it's Islamic or not\". These critics claim that \"the fierce response to Yuldashev stems from the government's deep fear of any religious group that operates without official sanction\".\n\nIn 2005, an armed uprising took place in Andijan. Among the demands was the release of Akrom Yo‘ldoshev. The Uzbek government cracked down, and several hundred civilians were killed in the events that ended the uprising.\n\nHis wife, Yodgoroy Yo‘ldosheva, has lived in Boise, Idaho, United States along with 52 other refugees since the Andijan massacre in May 2005. Yo‘ldoshev has appeared on state-run television three times, apologizing for encouraging the unrest and telling refugees they should return to Uzbekistan. Yo‘ldosheva herself has asked the Uzbek government for permission to return, but has not yet received an answer. His wife has denied Yo‘ldoshev has any ties to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a militant organization affiliated with Al-Qaeda, or Hizb ut-Tahrir, another Islamist organization.\n\nYuldashev's trial appearances in late 2005 were the last times anyone outside the government ever saw him. His fate has remained a mystery until 2016.\n\nInternational rights groups such as U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) repeatedly released statements calling on Uzbekistan's government to provide some information about Yuldashev.\n\nIn January 2016, Uzbek Service announced that Yuldashev died, five years ago, of tuberculosis while imprisoned.\n\n"}
{"id": "1892419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892419", "title": "Johannes Steinhoff", "text": "Johannes Steinhoff\n\nJohannes \"Macky\" Steinhoff (15 September 1913 – 21 February 1994) was a Luftwaffe fighter ace during World War II, German general, and NATO official. He was one of very few Luftwaffe pilots who survived to fly operationally through the whole of the war period 1939–45. He was also one of the highest-scoring pilots with 176 victories, and one of the first to fly the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter in combat as a member of the Jagdverband 44 squadron led by Adolf Galland. Steinhoff was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, and later received the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and several foreign awards including the American Legion of Merit and the French Legion of Honour. He played a role in the so-called Fighter Pilots Conspiracy when several senior air force officers confronted Hermann Göring late in the war.\n\nAs a member of Jagdverband-44 (JV-44) Steinhoff was permanently disfigured after receiving major burns across most of his body after crashing his Me-262 after a failed takeoff. His flight leader's left wheel had blown out causing him to turn and make a sharp left turn, careening into Steinhoff and causing him to run off the runway and have the fuel tanks located in front, under and behind him rupture. On that fateful day, Steinhoff and the men he was going up with that day were armed with an experimental under wing rocket which along with the cannon ammunition Steinhoff was carrying, made an escape all the more difficult due to the amount ordnance exploding around him. According to ace fighter pilot and member of JV-44 Franz Stigler, \"In a matter of seconds, Steinhoff had turned into a human torch.\" Steinhoff was left with horrible scarring for the rest of his life and his chances of survival were slim, but he pulled through in the end; retiring as a four star general in the new German Air Force at age 59.\n\nSteinhoff joined the West German government's Rearmament Office as a consultant on military aviation in 1952 and became one of the principal officials tasked with building the German Air Force during the Cold War. He became the German Military Representative to the NATO Military Committee in 1960, served as Acting Commander Allied Air Forces Central Europe in NATO 1965–1966, as Inspector of the Air Force 1966–1970 and as Chairman of the NATO Military Committee 1971–1974. In retirement, Steinhoff became a widely read author of books on German military aviation during the Second World War and the experiences of the German people at that time.\n\nHe was the father-in-law of economics professor and former American Republican politician Michael Bird.\n\nJohannes Steinhoff was born on 15 September 1913 in Bottendorf, Thuringia, the son of an agricultural mill-worker and his traditional housewife. He had two brothers, Bernd and Wolf, and two sisters, Greta and Charlotte. His sister Charlotte was married to Ludwig Hahn. Hahn was the chief of the \"Sicherheitspolizei\" and \"Sicherheitsdienst\" in occupied Warsaw and participated in the destruction and evacuation of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nSteinhoff graduated from the convent school after having \"studied the classics and languages such as French, English, Latin and Greek,\" and from 1932–1934 he read philology at the University of Jena, where he was a member of the academic fencing society and male fraternity. Forced to abandon his university studies for lack of funds, Steinhoff enlisted in the Kriegsmarine, where he served for one year alongside his friend Dietrich Hrabak as a naval flying cadet before transferring to the newly reformed Luftwaffe in 1936. There, after completing his training as a fighter pilot, Steinhoff was posted to Jagdgeschwader 26.\n\nSteinhoff married his wife Ursula on 29 April 1939. They had a son named Wolf and a daughter named Ursula. Ursula married economics professor and (now-retired) Colorado State Senator Michael Bird.\n\nSteinhoff's first combat experience was in 1939 when he fought RAF Vickers Wellington bombers that were attacking coastal industry in the Wilhelmshaven region. In February 1940, he was transferred to 4./JG 52 where he served during the Battle of France and the Battle of Britain.\n\nIn June 1941 JG 52 was on the Eastern Front for offensive operations against the Soviet Union, becoming one of the highest scoring units in the Luftwaffe. Steinhoff claimed 28 Soviet aircraft shot down in the first month and by August, Steinhoff had attained 35 victories and been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. In February 1942, as a \"Hauptmann\", he was appointed to command II./JG 52 and claimed his 100th victory on 31 August. He was the 18th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. Steinhoff remained with JG 52 until March 1943, when he took over \"Jagdgeschwader\" 77 as \"Geschwaderkommodore\" operating over the Mediterranean.\nOn 28 July 1944, Steinhoff received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (). He ended the war as a jet pilot, first being posted to \"Kommando Nowotny\" in October 1944 and then, with the rank of Oberst, as \"Geschwaderkommodore\" of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 7 in December. JG 7 was equipped with the Me 262 jet fighter and Steinhoff was allowed to hand-pick several \"Staffelkapitäne\", including Heinz Bär and Gerhard Barkhorn. After the heavy losses suffered during Operation Bodenplatte (\"Unternehmen Bodenplatte\"), Steinhoff and other fighter leaders fell into disfavour following the so-called 'Fighter Pilots Revolt' against what was perceived as the incompetence of Luftwaffe high command and Hermann Göring in particular. Along with several others, Steinhoff was relieved of his command for challenging Göring's leadership.\n\nAfter a brief period spent in internal exile, Steinhoff transferred to the \"Jet Experten\" unit \"Jagdverband\" 44 being formed by his close friend and confidant Adolf Galland in early 1945. Steinhoff initially acted as a de facto recruiting officer, persuading a number of veteran Luftwaffe aces to join the unit, some coming out of the Fighter Pilots' Rest Home at Bad Wiessee to do so. Steinhoff scored six confirmed kills with the unit. Steinhoff survived nearly 1,000 combat missions, only to see his flying career come to an end on the ground. On 18 April 1945, Steinhoff's Me 262 suffered a tyre blow-out and crashed on take-off from München-Riem airfield. Steinhoff suffered severe burns (spending two years in hospital) which left him visibly scarred despite years of reconstructive surgery. His eyelids were rebuilt by a British surgeon after the war.\n\nHis wartime record was 176 aircraft claimed destroyed, of which 152 were on the Eastern Front, 12 on the Western Front and 12 in the Mediterranean. He also flew 993 operational sorties. Steinhoff was shot down 12 times but had to bail out only once. Explaining his preference to remain with his damaged aircraft, Steinhoff admitted: \"I only bailed out once. I never trusted the parachutes. I always landed my damaged planes, hoping not to get bounced on the way down when I lost power.\"\n\nSteinhoff recognised the situation of postwar Germany, and was invited by West Germany's new interim government to rebuild the Luftwaffe within NATO, eventually rising to the rank of full general. Steinhoff served as Chief of Staff and acting Commander Allied Air Forces Central Europe (1965–1966), Inspector of the Air Force (1966–1970) and later as Chairman of the NATO Military Committee (1971–1974).\n\nAfter retiring from his NATO command in 1974, Steinhoff became a widely read author of books on German military aviation during the war and the experiences of the German people at that time. He wrote \"The Final Hours,\" which detailed a late-war plot against Hermann Göring, and also published a vivid account of his time in Italy: \"Messerschmitts over Sicily: Diary of a Luftwaffe Fighter Commander.\" Steinhoff also became a watercolorist, and chairman of Germany's Dornier Aviation.\n\nSteinhoff received numerous honours for his work on the structure of the post war German Air Force and the integration of the German Federal Armed Forces into NATO, including: The Order of Merit with Star, the American Legion of Merit and the French Légion d'honneur.\n\nOne of Steinhoff's contributions was dealing with the high accident rate the air force was having with its F-104 Starfighters. Upon researching the issue, Steinhoff, who had always been a good teacher, deduced that the problem was not the aircraft but poor training for pilots on that particular aircraft. He addressed the problem with an intensive training regime and the accident rate dropped dramatically.\n\nIn May 1985 Steinhoff met Ronald Reagan, the then President of the United States, during a visit to the WWII Kolmeshöhe Military Cemetery near Bitburg. The event was planned to be an act of reconciliation on the 40th anniversary of V-E Day. Reagan and then West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl were to pay their respects at the German military cemetery. However, the US President faced national and political pressure to cancel the visit from American Jewish groups and World War II American veterans after it was discovered that 22 Waffen-SS men were buried among the 2,000 military graves. \n\nThe presence of Nazi soldiers led to the Bitburg controversy because the entire SS had been adjudged to be a criminal organisation at the Nuremberg trials. Although not originally part of the itinerary, Reagan and Kohl made a visit to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp before visiting Bitburg. \n\nReagan stayed only eight minutes at Kolmeshöhe Military Cemetery. He was joined by Steinhoff, Kohl, and 90-year-old US Army General Matthew Ridgway who had commanded the 82nd Airborne in World War II. After Reagan placed a wreath at the cemetery memorial, they all stood to attention while a short trumpet salute was played. At the end, Steinhoff suddenly turned and, in an unscripted act, shook hands firmly with a pleased Ridgway in an act of genuine reconciliation. A very surprised Kohl later thanked Steinhoff for his actions, who later said that it just seemed to be the right thing to do.\n\nOn February 21, 1994, Steinhoff died in a Bonn hospital from complications arising from a heart attack he suffered the previous December. He was 80, and had lived in nearby Bad Godesberg.\n\nMatthews and Foreman, authors of \"Luftwaffe Aces — Biographies and Victory Claims\", researched the German Federal Archives and found records for 168 aerial victory claims, plus nine further unconfirmed claims. This figure of confirmed claims includes 149 aerial victories on the Eastern Front and 19 on the Western Front, including three four-engined bombers and six victories with the Me 262 jet fighter.\n\nVictory claims were logged to a map-reference (PQ = \"Planquadrat\"), for example \"PQ 95371\". The Luftwaffe grid map () covered all of Europe, western Russia and North Africa and was composed of rectangles measuring 15 minutes of latitude by 30 minutes of longitude, an area of about . These sectors were then subdivided into 36 smaller units to give a location area 3 × 4 km in size.\n\n\nIn 1990, the former Royal Air Force Gatow in Berlin Gatow, was named General Steinhoff Kaserne on being taken over by the German Federal Armed Forces. And on September 18, 1997, the \"Jagdgeschwader 73\" (fighter wing 73) of the German Air Force was named \"Steinhoff\" in honor of the general. Steinhoff is one of only a handful of pilots honored in this way, along with Manfred von Richthofen and Max Immelmann.\n\n"}

From 2001 to 2007 she reported—and then anchored—cable news at Fox News.\n\nKiran was born in Patan Hospital (Shanta Bhawan), Patan, Nepal. Seven months later her parents moved their new family to the United States. Her surname, Chetry, refers to the traditional caste of rulers and soldiers among Hindus in the Middle Hills of Nepal. Kiran's father Hom Chetry belongs to this community. Kiran's mother Nancy is of German, Ukrainian, and Dutch ancestry. Her parents met while Nancy was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Nepal. Kiran grew up in Gaithersburg, Maryland and attended Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, where she served in student government, danced on the pom squad, and competed on the swim team. Upon graduation she enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park's College of Journalism, where she joined the Alpha Pi chapter of Delta Delta Delta sorority and received her Bachelor of Arts in broadcast journalism.\n\nChetry began her career in 1995 at News 21 in Rockville, Maryland. The next year she moved to WICU-TV in Erie, Pennsylvania, where she was the main anchor and health reporter. (She met her future husband Chris Knowles there who was the prime-time news anchor.) She received the Best Enterprise Reporting award from the Pennsylvania Associated Press Broadcasters Association in 1997 for her series \"Young and Hooked,\" which looked at teen smoking. In 1999 Chetry went from WICU-TV to KXTV in Sacramento, California to work as a morning anchor and reporter until joining Fox News Channel.\n\nIn 2001 Chetry joined the cable news network Fox News Channel as a general reporter, first appearing on March 8, 2001, in a story about eating ice cream. The next year Chetry was honored with the Making our Mark (MOM) Award from the Association of Nepalis in the Americas. During her time at Fox News, she worked as a rotating anchor for \"Fox News Live\" and the early morning news program \"Fox & Friends First\". In late 2005, she became a regular co-host on the network's weekend morning news program, \"Fox & Friends Weekend\".\n\nIn early 2007, as Chetry's contract with Fox News neared the end of its term, the network negotiated with Chetry's agent to renew her contract. Her contract was expected to be renewed with her continuing to co-host Fox & Friends Weekend. However, talks ended when Fox News claimed in a February 15, 2007, letter to Chetry's agent, that Chetry had demanded \"that Fox News include a clause in her new agreement that would have been detrimental to other Fox News Talent.\" The cable news network added that it would not renew her contract and that she was free to leave before the expiration of her contract: Chetry exercised that option. Allegedly, Chetry wanted a clause in her contract that would have had Gretchen Carlson, a co-anchor of \"Fox & Friends\", fired. Chetry's agent countered that the allegation of Chetry's wanting Carlson fired was \"absolutely false\". Another source said that the clause in question merely requested a written clarification of whether Chetry would become a \"Fox & Friends\" co-host and, if so, when. If that were not to happen by a certain date, then Chetry would have a window to exit her new contract.\n\nReportedly, CNN signed Chetry within an hour of her release from the Fox News Channel. On February 16, 2007, Chetry began work as a CNN anchor and correspondent. That very day she served as a co-host on \"American Morning\" in the morning, and anchored \"Anderson Cooper 360\" that evening. She went on to substitute as an anchor for \"Paula Zahn Now\" and \"CNN Newsroom\".\n\nOn April 4, 2007, CNN's President Jonathan Klein officially announced Chetry as the new co-anchor. Her first \"American Morning\" broadcast was on April 16, 2007. Her last day on\"American Morning\" and at CNN was July 29, 2011.\n\nIn August 2014, she co-anchored with Errol Barnett a few late-night telecasts for CNN International. She has also recently been an infomercial presenter for Nutribullet.\n\nIn 2006, Chetry made \"Maxim\" magazine's top-ten list of TV's sexiest news anchors, placing third on the list: she was ranked as America's sexiest female anchor and the world's second-sexiest female anchor.\n\nChetry was divorced from Chris Knowles, a former Fox News Channel and New York City WPIX-TV weekend weathercaster in 2013.They have a son and a daughter.

From October 2003 to November 2006 she served as co-host on several ESPN shows such as \"Cold Pizza\" (2003–2005), \"Breakfast at Churchill Downs\" (2004–2006), \"Breakfast at Pimlico\" (2004–2006), \"The ESPY Red Carpet Show\" (2005–2006), \"ESPN Hollywood\" (2005–2006) and \"Sports and Hollywood\" (2006). Andrews reported on horse racing, college basketball and football for the network. She used to host a Saturday night counter programming block against \"Hockey Night in Canada\" called \"Guys TV\" on TSN, and a Canadian cable show titled \"Cooking For Love\". She was a correspondent and host on \"Entertainment Tonight\" from November 2006-October 2009. Thea Andrews hosted the first season of \"Top Chef Canada\" and Nigel Lythgoe's country music singing competition, \"CMT's Next Superstar\". From January 7, 2013 until July 2015, she co-hosted \"The Insider\".\n\nAndrews was born in Toronto, Ontario to a Canadian businesswoman and a Macedonian lawyer. She attended Bishop Strachan School and was originally a \"jock\" before opting for theater instead. A reporter for a local cable channel as a sophomore, Andrews starred in \"\" in 1992. After high school, she attended Queen's University and graduated with a degree in Spanish and Latin American studies. While at Queen's University Andrews co-hosted (with Cameron Dixon) \"Paradigm Shift\" a weekly half-hour series which highlighted the works of Queen's University's Film Department.\n\nBy 1999, Andrews was a producer at \"Fashion Television\". The new millennium found her as host of the show \"Cooking For Love\". Soon, she was hosting \"Guy's TV\" on TSN. Though both were canceled, Andrews continued to pursue her dreams. She became a reporter on the show \"etalk Daily\" and eventually the show's host.\n\nAndrews also has a list of theatre credits, including \"Cabaret\" in high school and \"The Vagina Monologues\" in 2001. She has also produced a number of shows in addition to writing internet columns for TSN. Andrews had a small role in the film \"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\" as the TV anchorwoman.\n\nBefore her part on \"Cold Pizza\", Andrews was seen in the ESPN series \"Playmakers\" (2003), in which she played the role of Samantha Lovett, a television sports news reporter. The role was highly controversial and The Association for Women in Sports Media formally filed a complaint for the portrayal of Lovett. Andrews disagreed with this complaint in an interview with \"The Plain Dealer\" in 2004.\n\nAndrews joined ESPN in October 2003 as the national correspondent for Cold Pizza (2003–2005), ESPN2's signature morning show as she made her debut on October 20, 2003. Andrews' primary role on the daily weekday program (7-9 a.m. ET) was to provide live reports from sports and non-sports events as well as to present unique lifestyle features. The show was originally hosted by Jay Crawford and Kit Hoover. Eventually, Andrews became co-host.\n\nFrom 2004-2006, she co-hosted the Triple Crown morning shows on ESPN2 such as Breakfast at Churchill Downs (2004–2006) and Breakfast at Pimlico (2004–2006), a program of the morning the Kentucky Oaks, Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes (2004–2006). She also contributed to ESPN's long extensive coverage of the Triple Crown afternoon shows (2004–2006) including the Belmont Stakes.\n\nShe also covered other big horse racing events. She served as a reporter for the Breeders Cup Simulcast Show in 2004 and 2005.\n\nAfter 17 months on \"Cold Pizza\" the show began cutting both the airtime of Andrews and Kit Hoover. In an attempt to become more sports-oriented rather than a blend of sports, pop culture, and entertainment, the show dropped Andrews and Hoover altogether in March 2005. They were replaced by Dana Jacobson. While Hoover left the network in late 2006, Andrews had already agreed several months prior to be transferred to Los Angeles to co-host ESPN2's new evening entertainment show, \"ESPN Hollywood\".\n\nShe also co-hosted The ESPY Red Carpet Show (2005–2006) with Stuart Scott in July 2005.

They re-formed in 2001 with several new members. Their debut single, \"Don't Dictate\", is now acknowledged as a classic punk rock single and their debut album, \"Moving Targets\" (1978), is still widely admired.\n\nThe band's lineup was lead singer Pauline Murray, Robert Blamire (bass), Gary Smallman (drums) and Gary Chaplin (guitar). Chaplin left in March 1978 being replaced with Neale Floyd, with second guitarist Fred Purser joining in July. The band dissolved in late 1979. They reformed in 2001 with original members Murray, Blamire and Smallman, and Steve Wallace and Paul Harvey drafted in as new guitarists.\n\nFormed in Ferryhill as The Points, under which name they played their first gig, at the Rock Garden pub in Middlesbrough in October 1976, they changed the band's name after a 1973 song by Iggy & The Stooges. Their second gig was supporting The Stranglers at Newcastle City Hall. Significantly, the band also played at the club The Roxy during its first 100 days. On 9 April 1977, the band appeared on the same bill as Generation X. Early in their career, the band also supported The Vibrators and toured with Buzzcocks.\n\nAfter the release of their second single, Penetration recorded the first of two sessions for John Peel at BBC Radio 1 in July 1978. Later that year, the band released their debut album. \"Moving Targets\" was number 6 in the \"Sounds\" Critics' albums of the year; and it made number 13 in the \"NME\" critics' chart.\n\nIn 1979, they toured Europe, the US and Britain but the grueling schedule began to take its toll. A disappointing reaction to \"Coming Up For Air\", the second album, was the final nail in the coffin of the original band. After the band split in October an official bootleg album called \"Race Against Time\" was released, which was a collection of early demos and live tracks.\n\nIn 1980, Pauline Murray collaborated with The Invisible Girls, which also included Robert Blamire, as well as other Manchester musicians such as Vini Reilly, guitarist in The Durutti Column, and Steve Hopkins. John Maher from Buzzcocks drummed for the band. Produced by Martin Hannett, the resulting album spawned the singles \"Dream Sequence\" and \"Mr.X\", with a further non-album single \"Searching for Heaven\" released in 1981. Murray also provided guest vocals for The Only Ones' 1980 track, \"Fools\". Former guitarist Gary Chaplin formed the short-lived new wave bands The Rhythm Clicks, which released the single \"Short Time\" in 1980, and Soul On Ice which released the singles \"Underwater\" and \"Widescreen\" in 1982 and 1983 respectively.\n\nPauline Murray worked sporadically as a solo artist under the name 'Pauline Murray and The Storm' with Robert Blamire, Tim Johnston and Paul Harvey. Paul Harvey is also a Stuckist artist. Blamire also worked as a producer for various groups, including Scars, whose sole LP (1981's \"Author! Author!\") he produced.\n\nIn 2015, Penetration announced the release of a new album called \"Resolution\" in October. The current line-up of the band is Pauline Murray, Robert Blamire, John Maher (ex-Buzzcocks), Paul Harvey and Steve Wallace.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The genus Ensatina originated approximately 21.5 million years ago. It is usually considered as monospecific, being represented by a single species, Ensatina eschscholtzii, with several subspecies forming a ring species.\n\nThe Ensatina subspecies \"E. e. eschscholtzii\", or Monterey ensatina, can be found in Santa Cruz, Monterey, and the California coastal mountains. They reach a total length of three to five inches, and can be identified primarily by the structure of the tail, and how it is narrower at the base. This salamander is the only type that has this tail structure and five toes on the back feet.\n\nMales often have longer tails than the females, and many of the salamanders have lighter colored limbs in comparison to the rest of the body. The salamanders lay their eggs underground, often in threes, which then hatch directly into salamanders, skipping the usual aquatic phase.\n\n\"Ensatina eschscholtzii\" has been described as a ring species in the mountains surrounding the Californian Central Valley. The complex forms a horseshoe shape around the mountains, and though interbreeding can happen between each of the 19 populations around the horseshoe, the \"Ensatina eschscholtzii\" subspecies on the western end of the horseshoe cannot interbreed with the \"Ensatina klauberi\" on the eastern end. As such, it is thought to be an example of incipient speciation, and provides an illustration of \"nearly all stages in a speciation process\" (Dobzhansky, 1958). Richard Highton argued that \"Ensatina\" is a case of multiple species and not a continuum of one species (meaning, by traditional definitions, it is not a ring species).\n\nThe ensatina can usually be found under logs or brush, by or in streams and lakes, and in other moist places. They are easily distressed by improper handling, because they rely on cutaneous respiration, their thin skin is very sensitive to heating, drying and exposure to chemicals from warm hands. They may exude a sticky milky secretion from the tail\n\n\n"}

It is a multifaceted retelling of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir through the experiences of soldiers, commanders, pilots, Korean citizens and the Chinese. \"On Desperate Ground\" on a deeper level, is also an indictment of the overweening hubris of General of the Army, Douglas MacArthur. Through MacArthur's self-proclaimed expertise on the \"Oriental mind\" and what Sides referred to as MacArthur's \"solemn regard for his own mind\", MacArthur was thoroughly convinced of American victory; instead, and while completely ignoring the advice of leaders on the ground, MacArthur sent American troops into what could only result into a massacre.fHistorian Douglas Brinkley called the book “a heart-pounding, fiercely written . . . one of the finest battle books ever.” A reviewer for Bloomberg, calling the book “ superb,” wrote that \"On Desperate Ground\" \"should be required reading for negotiators on both sides of the DMZ.” \"The Washington Post\" named \"On Desperate Ground\" one of the ten best books of 2018, and the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation named it the year's best non-fiction book. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1892492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892492", "title": "Love Beach", "text": "Love Beach\n\nLove Beach is the seventh studio album by English progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer. It was released in November 1978 by Atlantic Records as their final studio album released prior to their split in the following year. By the end of their 1977–1978 North American tour internal relations had started to deteriorate, but the group were contractually required to produce one more album. They retreated to Nassau, Bahamas as tax exiles to record \"Love Beach\" with lyricist Peter Sinfield who is credited as a co-writer of each track. After Greg Lake and Carl Palmer had finished recording their parts they left the island, leaving Keith Emerson to finish the album himself.\n\nThe album received negative reviews from critics. It reached No. 48 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 55 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 where it reached gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America in January 1979 for selling 500,000 copies. It spawned one single released in the UK, Lake and Sinfield's track \"All I Want is You\". The album was not supported with a tour and in early 1979, Emerson, Lake & Palmer disbanded.\n\nIn March 1978, the band finished their ten-month North American tour in support of \"Works Volume 1\" (1977) and \"Works Volume 2\" (1977). Several early shows featured the group playing with a symphony orchestra on stage but it proved too costly to operate and the idea was dropped. Despite the group preferring to rest, they were encouraged by Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun to record a new album. He also reminded them that they had to deliver one more. Emerson recalled the band's meeting with Ertegun and his suggestion for the group to make \"a commercial album\" which Emerson felt reluctant to do. Lake recalled that Ertegun threatened to decline the band the prospect of solo albums if they refused to work together, so they agreed. Feeling the need for a commercial album suited Lake's method of songwriting, who was responsible for their previous radio friendly songs like \"Lucky Man\" and \"From the Beginning\", Emerson \"eased up on my opinions to an extent, bit my nails, and gave him the freedom he kept asking for on side one\".\nThe band had become tax exiles due to the discouraging British tax laws placed on musicians at the time and decided to record in Nassau in the Bahamas where Emerson and Lake were renting homes. Recording took place in 1978 at Compass Point Studios without a dedicated producer, despite Lake having produced all of their previous albums. Early pressings of \"Love Beach\" carried no dedicated producer's credit, but production and mixing of the album were largely carried out by Emerson. Assisting the group were Jack Nuber and Karl Pitterson as engineers on engineer duties. The sessions were difficult due to the increasingly strained relations between the three musicians. Emerson's increasing drug use had started to affect his ability to work or collaborate with others.\n\nLyricist Peter Sinfield, who had worked with Lake in King Crimson and on his collection of songs on \"Works Volume 1\", was asked by band manager Stewart Young to join them in Nassau and assist Lake in writing the lyrics. Though frictions had arisen between Sinfield and Lake by this time Sinfield thought a break would be good for him and accepted yet given the limited amount of time he had, requested that he worked alone. Upon arrival, Sinfield found the group were barely talking to each other and left the island when he was done. Lake and Palmer followed suit after they had put down their parts, leaving Emerson to put \"the whole album together ... and sent it off\".\n\nEmerson was particularly upset about the album's title, which Atlantic Records had taken from one of the album's tracks by Lake and Sinfield, itself named after a stretch of beach on Nassau. The front cover was taken on an island off Salt Cay, depicting the group as biographer Edward Macan described as \"bare-chested late-seventies disco stars\". Emerson then organised a booth at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport to conduct a survey on the public's opinion on the album with a questionnaire. The overall opinion was of disagreement of the title which Emerson presented back to Atlantic, but the label refused to change.\n\nThe first side of the album consists of short tracks mostly penned by Lake and Sinfield.\n\nSide two consists of \"Memoirs of an Officer and a Gentleman\", a 20-minute track in four distinct parts. It is a concept piece that tells a story of a romance between a soldier and his fiancée during World War II, marking the first track by the band that deals with everyday people, in contrast to their previous fantasy-inspired epics such as \"Tarkus\" and \"Karn Evil 9\". Sinfield wrote all of the lyrics and later felt relieved to find a lyrical theme that worked for the song given the limited amount of time he had to work. Emerson considered the words \"a bit gross\".\n\n\"Love Beach\" was released in November 1978. Emerson later called the album \"an embarrassment against everything I've worked for\". Upon release Palmer spent two months arranging a farewell tour, but ongoing disagreements in the group led to the idea being shelved.\n\nCritical and fan appraisal of the album is mainly negative; some consider it the nadir of ELP's output, while others consider \"Black Moon\" and/or \"In the Hot Seat\" to be worse.\nWriting in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine at the time of the album's release, reviewer Michael Bloom said that \"\"Love Beach\" isn't simply bad; it's downright pathetic. Stale and full of ennui, this album makes washing the dishes seem a more creative act by comparison\".\nThe album was not toured or promoted by the band, although they did play \"All I Want Is You\" on the \"Old Grey Whistle Test\".\n\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nProduction\n\n\nSources\n"}

Phantom Blue were the first and only female artists to be signed to Mike Varney's Shrapnel Records, only three months after forming.\n\nPhantom Blue was formed in 1988 in Hollywood, California by Michelle Meldrum and Nicole Couch. Couch and Meldrum were students of Paul Gilbert and Bruce Bouillet of Racer X. Michelle Meldrum had played with drummer Linda McDonald in previous projects and together with vocalist Gigi Hangach and original bassist, Debra Armstrong. Armstrong left the band in June 1988, prior to the band signing with Shrapnel Records, in October 1988, and was replaced by Kim Nielsen, a student of John Alderete, bassist for Racer X and The Mars Volta. Phantom Blue recorded their self-titled first album with the help of producer Steve Fontano and fellow Shrapnel label mate, Marty Friedman. Couch and Meldrum also co-wrote a track on the album with Marty Freidman. Roadrunner Records, who owned the bands European distribution rights, were responsible for the band shooting a video for the single \"Why Call It Love?\" and a successful European tour followed.\n\nUpon returning to the States, Phantom Blue caught the attention of singer Don Dokken who introduced them to Tom Zutaut of Geffen Records. Other major labels were interested in signing the band, most notably Disney's Hollywood Records, but the band signed with Geffen. Couch and Meldrum began writing the material for the Geffen release. Couch left the band prior to recording and Meldrum successfully recorded all the guitar parts for \"Built to Perform\". Guitarist Karen Kreutzer replaced Couch and the band embarked on another successful European tour and shot a video for the single \"Time to Run\".\n\nThe band was eventually dropped from Geffen, sued by manager Byron Hontas and the management position was taken over by Mark Dawson, boyfriend of drummer Linda McDonald. Guitarist Michelle Meldrum was the first to leave due to disagreement as to the direction of the band under Dawson and vocalist Gigi Hangach soon followed. By 1996, McDonald was the only original member left and she continued to use the name Phantom Blue, enlisting a total of ten different members until finally calling it quits in early 2001.\n\nDrummer Linda McDonald went on to form The Iron Maidens (billed as \"The World's Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden\"), who released a self-titled tribute album worldwide and Japanese release version, the CD/DVD release \"Route 666\" and the EP \"The Root of All Evil\" in Japan. In addition, she played drums in the cover bands Crabby Patty (I'm So Unclear!), Unholy Pink and Valley Dolls. She was also the drummer of the all-female Ozzy Osbourne tribute The Little Dolls from 2005 to 2010.\n\nGuitarist Karen Kreutzer (from the 1993-1997 lineups) retired after moving to West River, Maryland. She is currently married with one daughter and has worked as a data analyst for a content solutions company.\n\nBassist Kim Nielsen (who, for a brief period, went by her married name Kim Nielsen-Parsons) worked in tour production and as an artist management assistant, working with many top bands in the music industry. Her most notable work outside of Phantom Blue is on Asia's 2004 album \"Silent Nation\". She has been working with UK band, Wraith, and appeared on their 2017 album \"Revelation\".\n\nLead vocalist Gigi Hangach currently resides in Las Vegas, Nevada and is a supporter of animal rights.\n\nGuitarist Nicole Couch currently lives in New York City with her husband and two kids and has worked as a music teacher.\n\nOriginal bassist Debra Armstrong currently lives in Sioux City, Iowa with her husband. She left the music industry soon after being replaced by Kim Nielsen in 1988, and went on to pursue a career in 3D modeling and engineering, working for clients such as Disney Imagineering, DARPA and others.\n\nGuitarist Michelle Meldrum went on to form an international band called Meldrum. The band has toured with Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society, Motörhead, Sepultura, Nashville Pussy and Danzig. They have released a live DVD, \"Loaded Live\", and two albums, \"Loaded Mental Cannon\" and \"Blowin' Up the Machine\", the latter featuring her former Phantom Blue bandmate, drummer Linda McDonald. On May 21, 2008, Meldrum died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage. She left behind her husband John Norum (of Europe) and their son Jake.\n\nOn May 26, 2009, Linda McDonald, Gigi Hangach and Kim Nielsen reunited as Phantom Blue for the Michelle Meldrum Memorial Concert at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood, California. Meldrum's position was filled by Tina Wood (from the 1997 lineup), while Sara Marsh and Courtney Cox of The Iron Maidens filled in for Nicole Couch.\n\nOriginal members Gigi Hangach and Nicole Couch are constructing the website www.phantomblue.net in honor of Michelle Meldrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the first to perform spinal anesthesia and intravenous regional anesthesia.\n\nBier began his medical education at the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin in 1881, transferred to the Leipzig University in 1882, and transferred again to the University of Kiel in 1883. After receiving his medical degree from the University of Kiel in 1886, Bier worked as a general practitioner and ship's surgeon just outside the city of Kiel – which is a major port on the Baltic Sea. Bier began his residency in 1888 at the surgical clinic at the University of Kiel, under the mentorship of Friedrich von Esmarch. After professorships in Greifswald and Bonn, Bier was appointed Chief Surgeon and Geheimrat Professor of Surgery at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin.\n\nOn 16 August 1898, Bier performed the first operation under spinal anesthesia at the Royal Surgical Hospital of the University of Kiel. The patient was scheduled to undergo segmental resection of his left ankle, which was severely infected with tuberculosis, but he dreaded the prospect of general anesthesia because he had suffered severe adverse side effects during multiple previous operations. Therefore, Bier suggested \"cocainization\" of the spinal cord as an alternative to general anesthesia. Bier injected 15 mg of cocaine intrathecally, which was sufficient to allow him to perform the operation. The subject was fully conscious during the operation, but felt no pain. Two hours after the operation, the subject complained of nausea, vomiting, severe headache, and pain in his back and ankle. The vomiting, back and leg pain improved by the following day, but the headache was still present. Bier performed spinal anesthetics on five more subjects for lower extremity surgery, using a similar technique and achieving similar results.\n\nAfter this series of six subjects, Bier was to receive a spinal anesthetic administered by his assistant, August Hildebrandt. Unfortunately, although Hildebrandt placed the spinal needle correctly, with cerebrospinal fluid flowing freely from it, the syringe was only then discovered to not fit into the hub of the needle. During the efforts to fit the syringe into the hub of the needle, a great deal of cerebrospinal fluid escaped, most of the cocaine to be injected was lost, and the spinal anesthetic was consequently a complete failure. Later that same evening, Bier performed a cocaine spinal anesthetic on Hildebrandt. After the injection, Hildebrandt was temporarily unable to move or feel any sensation in his legs. The profound anesthesia of his legs was demonstrated using increasingly painful stimuli, including a needle inserted down to the femur, a blow with an iron hammer to the shins, forceful avulsion of pubic hair, and \"strong pressure and traction\" to the testicles. Later that evening, they celebrated their success with wine and cigars. Like all of Bier's previous experimental subjects, Bier and Hildebrandt both experienced severe post-spinal headaches. Hildebrandt's symptoms lasted about four days, while Bier remained confined to bed for nine days.\n\nIn 1908, Bier pioneered the use of intravenous regional anesthesia, a technique which is commonly referred to as a \"Bier block\". This technique is frequently used for operations of brief duration upon the hand, wrist, and forearm. It can also be used for operations of brief duration upon the foot, ankle, and leg.\n\nIn 1903 he joined the faculty of the University of Bonn as a full professor, where he taught until 1907. Then he went to Berlin, where he was appointed Geheimrat Professor of Surgery and Chief Surgeon at the Charité – Universitätsmedizin. Bier was elected President of the German Surgical Society in 1911. Bier treated many important people, such as Kaiser Wilhelm II, family members of Nicholas II of Russia, and Vladimir Lenin.\n\nAlthough he was arguably the most accomplished surgeon of his time, not all of his operations were successful. Hugo Stinnes (a Business magnate and politician who was among the wealthiest men in the world at that time) died on 10 April 1924, about a month after Bier performed a cholecystectomy on him. On 24 February 1925, Bier performed an appendectomy on Friedrich Ebert, the first President of Germany, who had signed the Weimar Constitution into law in 1919. Ebert, who had suffered from appendicitis for two weeks before it was diagnosed, died of septic shock four days after the operation. Upon Ebert's death, Paul von Hindenburg was elected as successor.\n\nBier was Chief Surgeon at the Charité in Berlin until 1928, when Ferdinand Sauerbruch (18751951) assumed the position. Bier remained at the Charité as Professor Emeritus until his retirement in 1932.\n\nBier is also considered to be a pioneer in the field of sports medicine, having played a pivotal role in establishing it as a discipline. Along with Arthur Mallwitz (18801968), Bier organized the first lectures in sports medicine at the University of Berlin in 1919. Bier served as director of the \"Deutsche Hochschule für Leibesübungen\" (\"German University of Physical Education\") in Berlin from its founding in 1920 until 1932. Sauerbruch temporarily headed the Academy until 1933, when Karl Gebhardt (18971948) assumed the directorship. Gebhardt became the first professor of sports medicine in Berlin. Gebhardt expanded on Bier's methods, adopting an academic approach to sports medicine and awarding degrees.\n\nIn 1910, Bier was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. The title of Geheimrat was bestowed upon Bier by German Emperor Wilhelm II. On 24 November 1936, Bier received the Eagle Shield of the German Reich. On 30 January 1938, Bier became one of only nine people to ever receive the German National Prize for Art and Science, an award created by Adolf Hitler that year as a replacement for the Nobel Prize, which he had forbidden Germans to accept.\n\n\n\n"}

The book ranks 55th on \"Publishers Weekly\"s All-Time Bestselling Children's Book List for the United States, with 2,209,774 copies sold as of 2001. This book is one of the \"Original 10\", generally considered by historians and critics of children's literature to be the best examples of all the Hardy Boys, and Stratemeyer Syndicate, writing.\n\nThis book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Leslie McFarlane in 1927. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet S. Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. While some volumes only had minor changes, the original version of this book had the plot significantly rewritten in 1959 by Adams.\n\nThe story begins with Frank and Joe Hardy barely avoiding being hit by a speeding driver, who they notice has bright red hair. Later, this same red-haired driver attempts a ferry boat ticket office robbery and successfully steals a yellow jalopy called \"Queen\" from the Hardys' friend, Chet Morton. Due to one witness reporting that the villain had dark hair, the Hardys assume he is using a red wig. It is learned that the thief returned to Chet's home to steal a tire, helping Frank and Joe to find \"Queen\" abandoned in a public wooded area.\n\nThe excitement of finding \"Queen\" is quickly gone when it is reported that there has been a robbery of forty thousand dollars in securities and jewels from the Tower Mansion owned by siblings Hurd and Adelia Applegate. Hurd Applegate is convinced that the Tower's caretaker, Henry Robinson, is the guilty party. The Hardys are especially concerned by this accusation, because Henry's son, Perry, is a friend of theirs who will have to quit school to work since his father can no longer get a job as a result of Applegate's accusation. The only \"proof\" of Henry Robinson's guilt is that he was suddenly able to pay off a debt and refused to reveal where he got the money to do so.\n\nThe Hardys suspect that the red-haired man may be involved with the Tower robbery and search the place where \"The Queen\" was found, finding the red wig. The Hardys' dad, detective Fenton Hardy, learns that the wig was manufactured in New York City. Fenton Hardy goes to New York and learns of a criminal named John \"Red\" Jackley who is fond of using disguises. Soon, Jackley is injured in a railroad handcar accident, causing him to be hospitalized. About to die, Jackley confesses that he committed the Tower Mansion robbery and put the loot \"in the old tower ...\" Jackley dies before he is able to explain further.\n\nFrank and Joe decide to go to the railroad where Jackley used to work to find more information. While investigating, they see two water towers nearby. Inside the water tower they find the stolen items, but are locked in the tower by a man calling himself Hobo Johnny. Johnny believes that anything in the tower belongs to him. Frank and Joe break out of the water tower and return the missing securities and jewelry, whereupon they receive the $1,000 reward. Following the revelations and with the stolen loot returned, Hurd re-hires Henry with an increase in salary and Hurd builds the greenhouse that Henry has been wanting.\n\n\n\n\n\"The Tower Treasure\" became the basis of a serial shown on the \"Mickey Mouse Club\" in 1956–1957 as \"The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure\", named for the descendant of the pirate who was searching for the priceless treasure.

It can be used either by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. It begins working within 15 minutes when taken by mouth and is faster in onset when used by injection. Effects last between 45 and 180 minutes.\nCommon side effect include high blood pressure, vomiting, seizures, headache, and low blood pressure. Other serious side effects include ergotism. It was originally made from the rye ergot fungus but can also be made from lysergic acid. Ergometrine is regulated because it can be used to make lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).\nErgometrine was discovered in 1932. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between US$0.12 and US$0.41 for an injectable dose and US$0.01 for a pill as of 2014. In the United States it is about US$1.75 per dose.\n\nIt has a medical use in obstetrics to facilitate delivery of the placenta and to prevent bleeding after childbirth by causing smooth muscle tissue in the blood vessel walls to narrow, thereby reducing blood flow. It is usually combined with oxytocin (Syntocinon) as syntometrine.\n\nIt can induce spasm of the coronary arteries. It is used to diagnose variant (Prinzmetal's) angina.\n\nPossible side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, chest pain, palpitation, bradycardia, transient hypertension and other cardiac arrhythmias, dyspnea, rashes, and shock. An overdose produces a characteristic poisoning, ergotism or \"St. Anthony's fire\": prolonged vasospasm resulting in gangrene and amputations; hallucinations and dementia; and abortions.\n\nGastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, are common. The drug is contraindicated in pregnancy, vascular disease, and psychosis.\n\nWhile it acts at alpha-adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonin receptors (the 5-HT receptor), it exerts on the uterus (and other smooth muscles) a powerful stimulant effect not clearly associated with a specific receptor type.\n\nThe pharmacological properties of ergot were known and had been utilised by midwives for centuries, but were not thoroughly researched and publicised until the early 20th century. However, its abortifacient effects and the danger of ergotism meant that it was only prescribed cautiously, as in the treatment of postpartum haemorrhage.\n\nErgometrine was first isolated and obtained by the chemists C Moir and H W Dudley in 1935. Caroline De Costa has argued that the adoption of ergometrine for preventative use and for treating bleeding contributed to the decline in the maternal mortality rate in much of the West during the early 20th century.\n\nErgometrine is listed as Table I precursors under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, as possible precursor compound for LSD. As an N-alkyl derivative of lysergamide, ergometrine is also covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, effectively rendering it illegal in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}
{"id": "1892526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892526", "title": "Duck test", "text": "Duck test\n\nThe duck test is a form of abductive reasoning. This is its usual expression: \n\nThe test implies that a person can identify an unknown subject by observing that subject's habitual characteristics. It is sometimes used to counter abstruse arguments that something is not what it appears to be.\n\nIndiana poet James Whitcomb Riley (1849–1916) may have coined the phrase when he wrote:\nA common variation of the wording of the phrase may have originated much later with Emil Mazey, secretary-treasurer of the United Auto Workers, at a labor meeting in 1946 accusing a person of being a communist:\n\nThe term was later popularized in the United States by Richard Cunningham Patterson Jr., United States ambassador to Guatemala in 1950 during the Cold War, who used the phrase when he accused Guatemala's Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán government of being Communist. Patterson explained his reasoning as follows:\n\nLater references to the duck test include Cardinal Richard Cushing's, who used the phrase in 1964 in reference to Fidel Castro.\n\nDouglas Adams parodied this test in his book \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\":\nMonty Python also referenced the test in the Witch Logic scene in their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail:\nA claimed recent application of the duck test was the denial of tax exempt \"nonprofit\" status to Blue Shield of California:\n\nThe Liskov Substitution Principle in computer science is sometimes expressed as a counter-example to the duck test:\nRussian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov used a version of the Duck Test in 2015 in response to allegations that Russian airstrikes in Syria were not targeting terrorist groups, primarily ISIS, but rather West-supported groups such as the Free Syrian Army. When asked to elaborate his definition of 'terrorist groups', he replied:\nProfessor Vladimir Vapnik, a pioneer and co-inventor of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a major contributor to the theory of machine learning and many foundational ideas in statistical learning, uses the duck test as a way to summarize the importance of simple predicates to classify things. During the discussion he often uses the test to illustrate that the concise format of the duck test is a form of intelligence that machines are not capable of producing.\n\nSimilarly, the term elephant test refers to situations in which an idea or thing, \"is hard to describe, but instantly recognizable when spotted\".\n\nThe term is often used in legal cases when there is an issue which may be open to interpretation, such as in the case of \"Cadogan Estates Ltd v Morris\", when Lord Justice Stuart-Smith referred to \"the well known elephant test. It is difficult to describe, but you know it when you see it\", and in \"Ivey v Genting Casinos\", when Lord Hughes (in discussing dishonesty) opined \"like the elephant, it is characterised more by recognition when encountered than by definition.\" \"Overruling\" in part R v Ghosh.\n\nA similar incantation (used however as a rule of exclusion) was invoked by the concurring opinion of Justice Potter Stewart in \"Jacobellis v. Ohio\", 378 U.S. 184 (1964), an obscenity case. He stated that the Constitution protected all obscenity except \"hard-core pornography\". Stewart opined, \"I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1892539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892539", "title": "IBM OfficeVision", "text": "IBM OfficeVision\n\nOfficeVision was an IBM proprietary office support application that primarily ran on IBM's VM operating system and its user interface CMS.\n\nOther platform versions were available, notably OV/MVS and OV/400. OfficeVision provided e-mail, shared calendars, and shared document storage and management, and it provides the ability to integrate word processing applications such as Displaywrite/370 and/or the Document Composition Facility (DCF/SCRIPT). IBM introduced OfficeVision in their May 1989 announcement, followed by several other key releases later. \n\nThe advent of the personal computer and the client–server paradigm changed the way organizations looked at office automation. In particular, office users wanted graphical user interfaces. Thus e-mail applications with PC clients became more popular.\n\nIBM's initial answer was OfficeVision/2, a server-requestor system designed to be the strategic implementation of IBM's Systems Application Architecture. The server could run on OS/2, VM, MVS (XA or ESA), or OS/400, while the requester required OS/2 Extended Edition running on IBM PS/2 personal computers, or DOS. IBM also developed OfficeVision/2 LAN for workgroups, which failed to find market acceptance and was withdrawn in 1992. IBM began to resell Lotus Notes and as an OfficeVision/2 replacement. Ultimately, IBM solved its OfficeVision problems through the hostile takeover of Lotus Software for its Lotus Notes product, one of the two most popular products for business e-mail and calendaring.\n\nIBM originally intended to deliver the Workplace Shell as part of the OfficeVision/2 LAN product, but in 1991 announced plans to release it as part of OS/2 2.0 instead:\n\nIBM last week said some features originally scheduled to ship in OfficeVision/2 LAN will be bundled into the current release of the product, while others will be either integrated into OS/2 or delayed indefinitely... IBM's Workplace Shell, an enhanced graphical user interface, is being lifted from OfficeVision/2 LAN to be included in OS/2 2.0... The shell offers the capability to trigger processes by dragging and dropping icons on the desktop, such as dropping a file into an electronic wastebasket. Porting that feature to the operating system will let any application take advantage of the interface.\n\nUsers of IBM OfficeVision included the New York State Legislature.\n\nIBM discontinued support of OfficeVision/VM as of October 6, 2003. IBM recommended that its OfficeVision/VM customers migrate to Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino environments, and IBM offered migration tools and services to assist. Guy Dehond, one of the beta-testers of the AS/400, developed the first migration tool. However, OfficeVision/MVS remained available for sale until March 2014, and was still supported until May 2015, and thus for a time was another migration option for OfficeVision/VM users. OfficeVision/MVS runs on IBM's z/OS operating system.\n\nOfficeVision/VM was originally named PROFS (for PRofessional OFfice System) and was initially made available in 1981. Before that it was a PRPQ (Programming Request for Price Quotation), an IBM administrative term for \"not quite supported\" software. The first release of PROFS was developed by IBM in Poughkeepsie, NY, in conjunction with Amoco, from a prototype developed years earlier in Poughkeepsie by Paul Gardner and others. Subsequent development took place in Dallas. The editor XEDIT was the basis of the word processing function in PROFS.\n\nPROFS itself was descended from an in-house system developed by IBM Poughkeepsie laboratory. Poughkeepsie developed a primitive in-house solution for office automation over the period 1970–1972; OFS (Office System), which evolved into PROFS, was developed by Poughkeepsie laboratory as a replacement for that earlier system and first installed in October 1974. Compared to Poughkeepsie's original in-house system, the distinctive new features added by OFS were a centralised database virtual machine (\"data base manager\" or \"DBM\") for shared permanent storage of documents, instead of storing all documents in user's personal virtual machines; and a centralised virtual machine (\"mailman master machine\" or \"distribution virtual machine\") to manage mail transfer between individuals, instead of relying on direct communication between the personal virtual machines of individual users. By 1981, IBM's Poughkeepsie site had over 500 PROFS users.\n\nIn 1983, IBM introduced release 2 of PROFS, along with auxiliary software to enable document interchange between PROFS, DISOSS, Displaywriter, IBM 8100 and IBM 5520 systems.\n\nPROFS and its e-mail component, known colloquially as PROFS Notes, featured prominently in the investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal. Oliver North believed he had deleted his correspondence, but the system archived it anyway. Congress subsequently examined the e-mail archives.\n\nOfficeVision/MVS originated from IBM DISOSS, and OfficeVision/400 from IBM Office/36.\n\nIBM's European Networking Center (ENC) in Heidelberg, Germany, developed prototype extensions to OfficeVision/VM to support Open Document Architecture (ODA), in particular a converter between ODA and Document Content Architecture (DCA) document formats.\n\nOfficeVision/VM for the Far Eastern languages of Japanese, Korean and Chinese, originated from IBM Office and Document Control System (ODPS), a DBCS-enabled porting from PROFS, plus document edit, store and search functions, similar to Displaywrite/370. It was an integrated office system for the Asian languages, that ran on IBM's mainframe computers under VM, offering such functions as email, calendar, and document processing & storing. IBM ODPS was later renamed as IBM OfficeVision/VM and its MVS version (using DISOSS) was not offered. After IBM's buyout of Lotus Development in 1995, the ODPS users were recommended to migrate to Lotus Notes.\n\nIBM ODPS was developed in IBM Tokyo Programming Center, located in Kawasaki, Japan, later absorbed into IBM Yamato Development Laboratory, in conjunction with IBM Dallas Programming Center in Westlake, Texas, U.S., where PROFS was developed, and other programming centers. It first became available in 1986 for Japanese, and then was translated into Korean by IBM Korea and into Traditional Chinese by IBM Taiwan. It was not translated into Simplified Chinese for mainland China.\n\nIBM ODPS consisted of four software components:\n\n"}
{"id": "1892541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892541", "title": "Moses Rose", "text": "Moses Rose\n\nLouis \"Moses\" Rose (1785? – 1850/1851?), also seen as Lewis Rose), was according to Texas legend the only man who chose to leave the besieged Alamo in 1836, rather than fight and die there. He was illiterate and many believe that his tale was embellished by those who were writing on his behalf. Finally, some question the accuracy of this part of the legend.\n\nAccording to the most commonly told story, Rose was a French Jew who had served in the French army under Napoleon. He supposedly served in Italy, the French invasion of Russia and the Peninsular War. It seems clear that he was at the Alamo for some unknown portion of the 13-day siege and missed the massacre at dawn on March 6, 1836. He knew many details about the Alamo garrison and gave the names of some participants, and, whenever asked, admitted that he had left when given the chance before the final assault, because he was not ready to die.\n\nIt is known that the butcher Louis Rose, of Nacogdoches, Texas, testified on behalf of the estates of five men who may have been at the Alamo. In each of these cases he made statements similar to \"left him in the Alimo <nowiki>[</nowiki>sic<nowiki>]</nowiki> 3 March 1836\". In none of his testimony did Rose explicitly state that he was a member of the Alamo garrison, or that he had entered the Alamo and later escaped. In at least one case, the man on whose behalf he testified had not been at the Alamo, although he had the same name as one of the known Alamo defenders; in a second case, the man (Henry Teal), was later proved to have died after the battle's conclusion. The affidavit evidence appears to be reliable, since there is corroborative evidence of the named men having been in the garrison, and Rose' own presence in the Alamo was noted by the survivor Susanna Dickinson.\n\nRose was said to have been a member of Colonel James Bowie's forces and had fought during the siege of Bexar, and that he then joined Bowie in reinforcing the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Bexar in late January 1836. The available records do not permit historians to confirm these accounts. Rose's name is not found on any muster rolls for the siege of Bexar. Neither a Louis nor a Moses Rose is listed on the muster rolls that James C. Neill compiled for the Alamo garrison on December 31, 1835, or February 1, 1836, although Bowie was listed on the latter document.\n\nOn the other hand, a man named \"Rose\" from Nacogdoches was listed as an Alamo victim in the March 14, 1836, issue of the \"Telegraph and Texas Register\". This first attempt to name the men at the Alamo was compiled by John William Smith, one of the last couriers to leave the Alamo, and Gerald Navan, who probably also left the Alamo as a courier. Alamo survivor Susanna Dickinson testified in 1853 and again in 1857 that the only man named \"Rose\" of whom she knew in the Alamo was James Rose, who accompanied Davy Crockett and who had died. On the other hand, many of the known defenders from the roll accepted by historians are verified by less evidence than that supported Rose, and over the years names have been added or removed as evidence emerges. \n\nHistorian Thomas Ricks Lindley speculates that Louis \"Moses\" Rose had intended to fight at the Alamo and had joined volunteers who attempted to reinforce the Alamo on March 4. According to Lindley, while fifty or so of the volunteers successfully entered the Alamo complex, the remainder were driven away by Mexican troops. Rose may have been in the group that was repulsed, and either had seen some of his comrades enter the Alamo, or assumed that they had successfully entered. There is no other evidence that such a large group attempted to come to the aid of the defenders.\n\nThe traditional account of the battle includes the following description of Rose's actions.\n\nIn March 1836, the Alamo was surrounded by the Mexican Army, which raised a \"no quarter\" flag, promising death to all defenders. Travis, the Texan commander, drew a line in the sand with his sword. He asked the defenders to cross over it, and thereby pledge to fight (and presumably die) in the Alamo. All did, except Rose. Crockett is supposed to have urged him to cross the line, but he remained standing. Later in the night, he is supposed to have slipped over the wall.\n\nIf Rose fled the Alamo on the night Travis drew the line, it might have been March 3 or March 5, since by the evening of March 3 it was apparent that no further reinforcements were coming and Santa Anna had delivered both an ultimatum and a chance for noncombatants to leave safely. Rose managed to evade Mexican forces, and made his way to Grimes County, where he found rest and shelter at the home of one William P. Zuber. Rose made no attempt at hiding the true story of his journey, attributing his decision to a love for his family (including his children), stating that he \"just wasn't ready to die;\" or that he had the desire to fight another day rather than face a slaughter like those he had seen in previous failed battles. Rose did not fight another day, but moved on to settle in Nacogdoches, Texas, where he operated a butcher shop. He would unashamedly explain to customers or anyone who asked why he had decided not to die in the Alamo.\n\nSome historians have said that the story of the line in the sand was first told by Rose himself; however, it was standard frontier militia practice to give the men the choice to leave before battle, since they might leave on their own under fire anyway. In addition, other accounts of Travis \"haranguing\" the men or giving them the choice to stay were part of the record before the Zuber account surfaced, and similar ultimatums were given before other battles in Texas. Whether there ever was an actual \"line\" drawn in the sand is disputed, but the evidence does suggest that all Alamo defenders were at one point given a choice to stay or to go.\n\nWhen the legendary account is accepted, Louis Rose is sometimes portrayed as a coward, though he was 51 at the time and had seen the cost of futile warfare in conflicts on two continents. This is largely due to the pride Texans take from the Battle of the Alamo, and the contrast of Rose with the defenders who chose to stay and die. His alleged actions suffer further in comparison with the 32 volunteers who evaded the Mexican forces to join the garrison.\n\nSome advocates for Rose have noted that others also left during the battle, notably Juan Seguin (who was sent to seek reinforcements and is considered an Alamo hero), and at least twelve others who left as couriers during a brief armistice. Others note that Seguin and the other couriers were ordered to leave as part of their duty, while Rose chose to leave in order to save his own life. (In fact, Juan Seguin and other couriers returned to the scene, though the Alamo had fallen by the time Seguin arrived.)\n\nIn the years following the fall of the Alamo, Rose was sometimes contacted by relatives of men that died at the Alamo, to help verify their deaths, so that their survivors could settle land disputes or property claims. He was also sometimes casually questioned about his actions at the famous battle, and never denied that he had been there. As noted above, on some lists of the participants in the Battle of the Alamo, Rose is not even listed; proponents of the legendary account believe this is so because Rose left before the climax of the battle. In 1927, relatives of Rose presented his musket to the Alamo Museum.\n\nThe song \"Moses Rose of Texas,\" which was written by folk singer Steve Suffet and which uses the tune of the song \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\", begins with the popular story of Rose, saying in part \n\nSuffet's parody, however, goes on to present a more nuanced interpretation of Rose's actions:\n\nThe 1952 film \"The Man from the Alamo\", starring Glenn Ford, is loosely based on Rose's story, and Ford's character is accused of having been a coward, even though he was selected to escape the Alamo to protect the families of the defenders from looters and bandits. The film is very poor on historical accuracy, though the opening scenes of the battle are well done; and the plot was criticized by some Texan traditionalist groups, such as the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.\n\n\"For the first thirty-eight years of the twentieth century,\" wrote Thomas Ricks Lindley, \"William P. Zuber's story of Moses Rose's alleged escape from the Alamo was an unsubstantiated tale accepted by few historians.\" Then in 1939, Texas archivist Robert B. Blake uncovered land grant statements from the Nacogdoches County Courthouse containing elements that seemed to verify Zuber's story. Because Blake appears to have believed him, he assumed that a Stephen and a Lewis or Louis Rose who, in their day, had signed testimony about Alamo defenders to the Board of Land Commissioners, were but one and same old Frenchman whose real name was Louis Rose. According to Blake, it was the very Rose described in the Texas Almanac for 1873, \"Moses\" becoming a nickname given to him by the Alamo defenders for his great age, 50 (Gordon C. Jenning, 56, was the oldest Alamo fighter at the time).\n\nIn 1982, Steven G. Kellman, professor of comparative literature at the University of Texas at San Antonio, brought fresh grist to the mill by publishing a short study, \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\". Kellman believed that the copies of military documents he had obtained from the Service Historiques de la Défense in Vincennes, France, showed that Lieutenant \"Moses, né Louis\" Roze was born in La Férée, Ardennes, on May 11, 1785.\n\nTwo different first names – Stephen and Lewis or Louis – plus a nickname, Moses – for the same man now explicitly identified by Professor Kellman as an officer in Napoleon's army brought questions to historian Gerard Dôle's mind. In order to retrace the life of Louis Roze, he consulted Louis Roze's complete military records at the French Archives Historiques de la Défense in Vincennes, as well as the complete dossier on his Légion d'Honneur at the Archives Nationales in Paris. At the same time, his assistant Stéphane Vielle went to work collecting and studying various official documents concerning Lieutenant Louis Roze, born in La Férée, Ardennes, on May 11, 1785. Dôle and Vielle concluded that there had been a case of mistaken identity. Louis Roze, born in La Férée, could not have been the Louis \"Moses\" Rose of Nacogdoches and the Alamo because he had never crossed the Atlantic, though he died about the same time as the Alamo Rose, on May 25, 1851 in Braine. The certificate was signed and witnessed by his friend Paul Masure, and again mentions that Roze was a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur and native of La Férée.\n\n\n"}

The station is located on the Swindon-Gloucester \"Golden Valley\" line.\n\nThe station was formerly called Stonehouse Burdett Road to distinguish it from a second station, Stonehouse (Bristol Road), on the line between Bristol and Gloucester. Stonehouse Bristol Road closed to passengers under the Beeching Axe in 1965 and to goods traffic the following year.\n\nThe station has two platforms, and is operated by Great Western Railway. The station has a ticket office, located on the Gloucester-bound platform; it is normally only open in the mornings, until the end of the peak period.\n\nThe platforms are short: only about each. This is long enough to accommodate the two-coach trains used on – local services; but Class 800s running to or from London or Cheltenham Spa may be up to nine coaches. Since long trains cannot be accommodated entirely, such trains running towards Gloucester normally stop with the front two coaches in the platform, and those running toward London normally stop with the rear two in the platform. Passengers intending to alight at Stonehouse are advised earlier in their journeys to proceed along the train to the relevant coaches. Since trains from Cheltenham almost always reverse at Gloucester, this can lead to confusion for cyclists as to which end of the train in which to load their bicycles.\n\nIn December 2017 the station completed a £300,000 upgrade. The work included ground levelling, improved access and a new footbridge.\n\nIn 2018, improvements were made to the provision of service information for passengers, comprising the installation of LED dot-matrix passenger information screens and the provision of automated announcements.\n\nWorks to extend the short platforms by around 100m were completed in 2019. These changes were required for introduction of Class 166 trains, which are longer than the previous rolling stock used on the line.\n\nGreat Western Railway operate services from London Paddington to Gloucester and Cheltenham Spa using Class 800s, and limited local services from to Gloucester and Cheltenham using Class 165 two carriage sets.

It specialised in clothing that defined the look of the punk movement.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970, No. 430 was the premises of \"Mr Freedom\".\n\nIn October 1971, Malcolm McLaren and a friend from art school, Patrick Casey, opened a stall in the back of the \"Paradise Garage\" boutique at 430 King's Road in London's Chelsea district. On sale were items collected by McLaren over the previous year, including rock & roll records, magazines, clothing and memorabilia from the 1950s.\n\nTrevor Myles (who ran Paradise Garage), relinquished the entire premises to McLaren and Casey in November 1971. They renamed the shop \"Let It Rock\" with stock including second-hand and new Teddy Boy clothes designed by McLaren's school teacher girlfriend Vivienne Westwood. The shop-front corrugated iron frontage was painted black with the name pasted in pink lettering. The interior was given period detail, such as \"Odeon\" wallpaper and Festival of Britain trinkets. Bespoke tailored drape jackets, skin-tight trousers and thick-soled \"brothel creepers\" shoes were the mainstays. \"Let It Rock\" was soon covered in the \"London Evening Standard\".\n\nIn 1973 the outlet interior was changed and the shop was given a new name, \"Too Fast To Live, Too Young To Die\", to reflect a new range of clothing from Britain's early 1960s \"rocker\" fashions. In the spring of 1974 the shop underwent another refurbishment and was rebranded with the name \"Sex\".\n\nThe façade included a 4 ft sign of pink foam rubber letters spelling \"SEX\". The interior was covered with graffiti from the SCUM Manifesto and chickenwire. Rubber curtains covered the walls and red carpeting was installed.\n\n\"SEX\" sold fetish and bondage wear supplied by existing specialist labels such as Atomage, She-And-Me and London Leatherman as well as designs by McLaren and Westwood. Jordan (Pamela Rooke) was a sales assistant. Among customers at \"SEX\" were the four original members of Sex Pistols (the bass-player Glen Matlock was an employee as a sales assistant on Saturdays). The group's name was provided by McLaren in partial promotion of the boutique. In August 1975, nineteen-year-old John Lydon was persuaded to audition for the group by singing along to Alice Cooper's \"I'm Eighteen\" on the jukebox. Other notable patrons included occasional assistant Chrissie Hynde, Adam Ant, Marco Pirroni, Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin and the rest of the Bromley Contingent.\n\nThe store's designs confronted social and sexual taboos, and included T-shirts bearing images of the Cambridge Rapist's face hood, semi-naked cowboys from a 1969 illustration by the US artist Jim French, trompe-l'œil bare breasts by Rhode Island School of Design students Janusz and Laura Gottwald in the late 1960s, and pornographic texts from the book \"School for Wives\" (\"I groaned with pain...in a soft corrosion\") by the beat author Alexander Trocchi. Also featured were T-shirts with the slogan 'Prick Up Your Ears', a reference to the biography of influential proto-punk subversive Joe Orton, and text culled from the biography of Orton stating how cheap clothes suited him. Among the designs were clear plastic-pocketed jeans, zippered tops and the \"Anarchy shirt\" which used dead stock from the 1960s manufacturer Wemblex. These were bleached and dyed shirts and adorned with silk Karl Marx patches and anarchist slogans.\n\nIn December 1976, 430 King's Road was renamed \"Seditionaries\", trading under that title until September 1980. Designs were licensed by Westwood to the operators of the boutique at 153 King's Road, Boy (formerly Acme Attractions)who issued them, some with alterations, over the next eight years. Boy London was founded by Stephane Raynor and Israel-based businessman John Krivine in 1976 on the King's Road. Krivine sold the company in 1984.\n\nIn late 1980, the shop at 430 King's Road re-opened under the name \"World's End\". The building was designed by McLaren and Westwood and realised by Roger Burton, aided by Jeremy Blackburn and Tony Devers, to resemble a mixture of the Olde Curiosity Shoppe and an 18th-century galleon. The façade was installed with a large clock which spun backwards with the floor raked at an angle. McLaren and Westwood launched the first of a series of collections from the outlet at the beginning of 1981 and collaborated for a further three years. \"World's End\" remains open as part of Vivienne Westwood's global fashion empire.\n\nMany people related with the punk scene worked at the shop in one way or another. A notable employee was Jordan (Pamela Rooke), whose provocative dress sense served as a walking advertisement for the shop. At various times, Glen Matlock, Chrissie Hynde and Sid Vicious also worked there.\n\n\n"}

The process of cleaving an optical fiber forms one of the steps in the preparation for a fiber splice operation regardless of the subsequent splice being a fusion splice or a mechanical splice; the other steps in the preparation being those of stripping and fiber alignment. A good cleave is required for a successful low loss splice of an optical fiber, often it is the case that fibers spliced by identical methods tend to have different losses, this difference can often be attributed to the quality of their initial cleaves.\n\nThe general method of cleaving involves a general strategy known as the scribe-and-tension or scribe-and-break strategy. This strategy involves the introduction of a small crack into the fiber and the subsequent application of a tensile force in the vicinity of the crack that causes the fiber to cleave.\n\nA general cleaving strategy that is employed is known as the scribe-and-tension strategy or the scribe-and-break strategy. This process involves introduction of a crack in the fiber, generally by means of cutting tool made from a material such as diamond, sapphire, or tungsten carbide, followed by the application of tensile stress in the vicinity of the crack. However, the specific implementations of the cleaving vary and result in cleaves of different qualities.\n\nCertain implementations may apply the tensile force uniformly across the cross section of the fiber whereas others might bend the fiber around a curved surface causing excessive tensile stress on the outside of the bend. The introduction of the crack in the fiber may also be generated in different ways; the crack may be introduced at a single point on the circumference or it may be generated all along the circumference of the fiber prior to the application of the tensile force. The circumferential introduction of the crack often allows fibers of considerably large diameters to be cleaved while maintaining high quality of the cleave.\n\n\n\n"}

In a manuscript to be typeset, various forms of underlining were therefore conventionally used to indicate that text should be set in special type such as italics, part of a procedure known as markup. \n\nUnderlines are sometimes used as a diacritic, to indicate that a letter has a different pronunciation from its non-underlined form.\n\nThe following kinds of underlines are used on manuscripts to indicate the special typefaces to be used:\n\n\nIn web browsers, default settings typically distinguish hyperlinks by underlining them (and usually changing their color), but both users and websites can change the settings to make some or all hyperlinks appear differently (or even without distinction from normal text).\n\nThe HTML special inline element codice_1, denoting inserted text, is often presented as underlined text. HTML also has a presentational element codice_2, denoting underlined text; that is deprecated in favor of the CSS style codice_3.

Its meaning is somewhat akin to capitalization in English and should never be used for emphasis even if the influence of English computing makes the latter sometimes occur. A wavy underline (; pinyin: shūmínghào; literally, \" book title mark\") serves a similar function, but marks names of literary works instead of proper names.\n\nIn the case of two or more adjacent proper names, each individual proper name is separately underlined so there should be a slight gap between the underlining of each proper name.\n\n"}
{"id": "1892610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892610", "title": "Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy", "text": "Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy\n\nLeber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrially inherited (transmitted from mother to offspring) degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons that leads to an acute or subacute loss of central vision; this affects predominantly young adult males. LHON is only transmitted through the mother, as it is primarily due to mutations in the mitochondrial (not nuclear) genome, and only the egg contributes mitochondria to the embryo. LHON is usually due to one of three pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations. These mutations are at nucleotide positions 11778 G to A, 3460 G to A and 14484 T to C, respectively in the ND4, ND1 and ND6 subunit genes of complex I of the oxidative phosphorylation chain in mitochondria. Men cannot pass on the disease to their offspring.\n\nClinically, there is an acute onset of visual loss, first in one eye, and then a few weeks to months later in the other. Onset is usually young adulthood, but age range at onset from 7-75 is reported. The age of onset is slightly higher in females (range 19–55 years: mean 31.3 years) than males (range 15–53 years: mean 24.3). The male to female ratio varies between mutations: 3:1 for 3460 G>A, 6:1 for 11778 G>A and 8:1 for 14484 T>C.\n\nThis typically evolves to very severe optic atrophy and a permanent decrease of visual acuity. Both eyes become affected either simultaneously (25% of cases) or sequentially (75% of cases) with a median inter-eye delay of 8 weeks. Rarely only one eye may be affected. In the acute stage, lasting a few weeks, the affected eye demonstrates an oedematous appearance of the nerve fiber layer especially in the arcuate bundles and enlarged or telangiectatic and tortuous peripapillary vessels (microangiopathy). The main features are seen on fundus examination, just before or subsequent to the onset of visual loss. A pupillary defect may be visible in the acute stage as well. Examination reveals decreased visual acuity, loss of color vision and a cecocentral scotoma on visual field examination.\n\n\"LHON Plus\" is a name given to a rare variant of the disorder with eye disease together with other conditions. \n\nThe symptoms of this higher form of the disease include loss of the brain's ability to control the movement of muscles, tremors, and cardiac arrhythmia. Many cases of LHON plus have been comparable to multiple sclerosis because of the lack of muscular control and because of the presence of demyelinating lesions in the CNS. It is therefore a subtype of MS according to McDonalds definition.\n\nLeber hereditary optic neuropathy is a condition related to changes in mitochondrial DNA. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria have a distinct mitochondrial genome composed of mtDNA.\n\nMutations in the MT-ND1, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND6 genes cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. These genes code for the NADH dehydrogenase protein involved in the normal mitochondrial function of oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation uses a series of four large multienzyme complexes, which are all embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane to convert oxygen and simple sugars to energy. Mutations in any of the genes disrupt this process to cause a variety of syndromes depending on the type of mutation and other factors. It remains unclear how these genetic changes cause the death of cells in the optic nerve and lead to the specific features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.\n\nThe eye pathology is limited to the retinal ganglion cell layer especially the maculopapillary bundle. Degeneration is evident from the retinal ganglion cell bodies to the axonal pathways leading to the lateral geniculate nuclei. Experimental evidence reveals impaired glutamate transport and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. Also, experiments suggest that normal non LHON affected retinal ganglion cells produce less of the potent superoxide radical than other normal central nervous system neurons. Viral vector experiments which augment superoxide dismutase 2 in LHON cybrids or LHON animal models or use of exogenous glutathione in LHON cybrids have been shown to rescue LHON affected retinal ganglion cells from apoptotic death. These experiments may in part explain the death of LHON affected retinal ganglion cells in preference to other central nervous system neurons which also carry LHON affected mitochondria.\n\nWithout a known family history of LHON the diagnosis usually requires a neuro-ophthalmological evaluation and blood testing for mitochondrial DNA assessment. It is important to exclude other possible causes of vision loss and important associated syndromes such as heart electrical conduction system abnormalities. \n\nThe prognosis for those affected left untreated is almost always that of continued significant visual loss in both eyes. Regular corrected visual acuity and perimetry checks are advised for follow up of affected individuals. There is beneficial treatment available for some cases of this disease especially for early onset disease. Also, experimental treatment protocols are in progress. Genetic counselling should be offered. Health and lifestyle choices should be reassessed particularly in light of toxic and nutritional theories of gene expression. Vision aids assistance and work rehabilitation should be used to assist in maintaining employment.\n\nFor those who are carriers of a LHON mutation, preclinical markers may be used to monitor progress. For example, fundus photography can monitor nerve fiber layer swelling. Optical coherence tomography can be used for more detailed study of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Red green color vision testing may detect losses. Contrast sensitivity may be diminished. There could be an abnormal electroretinogram or visual evoked potentials. Neuron-specific enolase and axonal heavy chain neurofilament blood markers may predict conversion to affected status.\n\nCyanocobalamin (a form of B12) may also be used.\n\nAvoiding optic nerve toxins is generally advised, especially tobacco and alcohol. Certain prescription drugs are known to be a potential risk, so all drugs should be treated with suspicion and checked before use by those at risk. Ethambutol, in particular, has been implicated as triggering visual loss in carriers of LHON. In fact, toxic and nutritional optic neuropathies may have overlaps with LHON in symptoms, mitochondrial mechanisms of disease and management. Of note, when a patient carrying or suffering from LHON or toxic/nutritional optic neuropathy suffers a hypertensive crisis as a possible complication of the disease process, nitroprusside (trade name: Nipride) should not be used due to increased risk of optic nerve ischemia in response to this anti-hypertensive in particular.\n\nIdebenone has been shown in a small placebo controlled trial to have modest benefit in about half of patients. People most likely to respond best were those treated early in onset.\n\nα-Tocotrienol-quinone, a vitamin E metabolite, has had some success in small open label trials in reversing early onset vision loss.\n\nThere are various treatment approaches which have had early trials or are proposed, none yet with convincing evidence of usefulness or safety for treatment or prevention including brimonidine, minocycline, curcumin,\nglutathione, near infrared light treatment, and viral vector techniques.\n\n\"Three person in vitro fertilization\" is a proof of concept research technique for preventing mitochondrial disease in developing human fetuses. So far, viable macaque monkeys have been produced. But ethical and knowledge hurdles remain before use of the technique in humans is established.\n\nIdebenone is a short-chain benzoquinone that interacts with the mitochondrial electron transport chain to enhance cellular respiration. When used in individuals with LHON, it is believed to allow electrons to bypass the dysfunctional complex I. Successful treatment using idebenone was initially reported in a small number of patients.\n\nTwo large-scale studies have demonstrated the benefits of idebenone. The Rescue of Hereditary Optic Disease Outpatient Study (RHODOS) evaluated the effects of idebenone in 85 patients with LHON who had lost vision within the prior five years. In this study, the group taking idebenone 900 mg per day for 24 weeks showed a slight improvement in visual acuity compared to the placebo group, though this difference was not statistically significant. Importantly, however, patients taking idebenone were protected from further vision loss, whereas the placebo group had a steady decline in visual acuity. Further, individuals taking idebenone demonstrated preservation of color vision and persistence of the effects of idebenone 30 months after discontinuing therapy. A retrospective analysis of 103 LHON patients by Carelli et al. builds upon these results. This study highlighted that 44 subjects who were treated with idebenone within one year of onset of vision loss had better outcomes, and, further, that these improvements with idebenone persisted for years.\n\nIdebenone, combined with avoidance of smoke and limitation of alcohol intake, is the preferred standard treatment protocol for patients affected by LHON. Idebenone doses are prescribed to be taken spaced out throughout the day, rather than all at one time. For example, to achieve a dose of 900 mg per day, patients take 300 mg three times daily with meals. Idebenone is fat soluble, and may be taken with a moderate amount of dietary fat in each meal to promote absorption. It is recommended that patients on idebenone also take vitamin C 500 mg daily to keep idebenone in its reduced form, as it is most active in this state.\n\nEstrogens have been shown to have a protective role in the pathogenesis of LHON. Experiments using LHON cybrids have demonstrated that the estrogen receptor localizes to the mitochondria where it directly mediates mitochondrial biogenesis. Estrogens upregulate the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 and mitochondrial DNA synthesis. These experiments helped to explain the mechanism behind the lower penetrance of disease among female carriers. While additional factors have been theorized, the protective role of estrogens appears to be a significant contributor. \n\nIn addition to the experimental evidence, clinical data also points towards the protective role of estrogens. Penetrance among female carriers is substantially lower (between 3 and 8 to 1 male to female ratios depending on the mutation) while average age at onset is significantly higher. Multiple case series of various LHON pedigrees have described female carriers converting after menopause or cessation of hormone replacement therapies. Together, these form a shifting paradigm towards considering reduced estrogen states, such as menopause, as potential triggers of visual loss similar to smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. \n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) is emerging as an effective therapeutic target for female mutation carriers. In one recent case study where the affected female converted following cessation of HRT, idebenone, and HRT were given together. Visual acuity improved much faster than is typically expected. The patient’s vision returned to 20/40 and 20/60 from 20/60 and 20/200 in the right and left eyes respectively after only one month and was back normal by 8 months compared to the months to years timeframe seen in most cases. While the balance between risks and benefits of HRT remains controversial, the decision to start HRT requires an individualized approach based on the patient’s context. While not applicable for all post-menopausal women, prophylactic (and therapeutic) HRT should be considered in all female carriers of a known LHON mutation given the substantial risk of vision loss associated with menopause.\n\nIn Northern European populations about one in 9000 people carry one of the three primary LHON mutations.\n\nThe LHON ND4 G11778A mutation dominates as the primary mutation in most of the world\nwith 70% of Northern European cases and 90% of Asian cases. Due to a Founder effect, the LHON ND6 T14484C mutation accounts for 86% of LHON cases in Quebec, Canada.\n\nMore than 50 percent of males with a mutation and more than 85 percent of females with a mutation never experience vision loss or related medical problems. The particular mutation type may predict the likelihood of penetrance, severity of illness and probability of vision recovery in the affected. As a rule of thumb, a woman who harbors a homoplasmic primary LHON mutation has a ~40% risk of having an affected son and a ~10% risk of having an affected daughter.\n\nAdditional factors may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of this disorder. Environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use may be involved, although studies of these factors have produced conflicting results. Researchers are also investigating whether changes in additional genes, particularly genes on the X chromosome,\n\nThis disease was first described by the German ophthalmologist Theodor Leber (1840–1917) in 1871. In this paper Leber described four families in which a number of young men suffered abrupt loss of vision in both eyes either simultaneously or sequentially. This disease was initially thought to be X linked but was subsequently shown to be mitochondrial. The nature of the causative mutation was first identified in 1988 by Wallace \"et al.\" who discovered the guanine (G) to adenosine (A) mutation at nucleotide position 11778 in nine families. This mutation converts a highly conserved arginine to histidine at codon 340 in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The other two mutations known to cause this condition were identified in 1991 (G to A point mutation at nucleotide position 3460) and 1992 (thymidine (T) to cytosine (C) mutation at nucleotide 14484). These three mutations account for over 95% of cases: the 11778 mutation accounts for 50-70% of cases, the 14484 mutation for 10-15% and the 3460 mutation for 8-25%.\n\nCurrently, human clinical trials are underway at GenSight Biologics (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT02064569) and the University of Miami (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT02161380) to examine the safety and efficacy of mitochondrial gene therapy in LHON. In these trials, participants affected by LHON with the G11778A mutation will have a virus expressing the functional version of ND4 – the gene mutated in this variant of LHON – injected into one eye. A sham injection will be administered to the other eye for comparison. It is hypothesized that introduction of the viral vector may be able to rescue the function of the mutant gene. Preliminary results have demonstrated tolerability of the injections in a small number of subjects.\n\nStealth BioTherapeutics is presently investigating the potential use of elamipretide (MTP-131), a mitochondrial protective agent, as a therapy for LHON. Elamipretide helps stabilize cardiolipin – an important component of mitochondrial inner membranes – and has been shown to reduce damaging reactive oxygen species in animal models. Clinical trials in LHON patients are planned for the future.\n\n\n\n"}

The Very Best of The Partridge Family is a greatest hits compilation album from The Partridge Family released on May 3, 2005, in conjunction with the first season DVD collection. It contained some previously unreleased songs. During the course of the television series there were a number of recordings that were used on the program but never released on album or tape in stereo. Some were alternate mixes of released songs. These are known to fans as the \"Lost Songs\", four of which appear on this collection (tracks 4, 9, 10 and 12). They are noted as \"new release\" in the track listing below. Two of the songs appeared in the pilot episode of the show, tracks 9 and 12, listed below as having Ron Hicklin doing the vocals. Originally, the only cast member who was supposed to sing was Shirley Jones. After the producers heard David Cassidy's demos of the songs, however, they decided to let him sing after the first couple of episodes.\n\nTim Sendra of AllMusic concludes his review with, \"Whether the unreleased four songs belong on a\" Very Best Of\" collection is up for debate: On one hand it might have been better to add more songs that people remembered. but on the other it is nice to have the rarities unearthed. Either way, this is the best Partridge Family collection available.\"\n\n\n\nTrack information and credits adapted the album's liner notes.\n"}
{"id": "1892616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892616", "title": "Lake Pepin", "text": "Lake Pepin\n\nLake Pepin is a naturally occurring lake on the Mississippi River on the border between the U.S. states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. It is located in a valley carved by the outflow of an enormous glacial lake at the end of the last Ice Age. The lake formed when the Mississippi, a successor to the glacial river, was partially dammed by a delta from a tributary stream and spread out across the ancient valley.\n\nLake Pepin is now a corridor for water, highway, and rail transportation. Known as the birthplace of water skiing, it hosts a variety of recreational activities.\n\nLake Pepin has a surface area of about and an average depth of , It is up to 2 miles (3.2 km) wide and \n22 miles (35 km) long.\n\nThe wide area of the lake stretches from Bay City, Wisconsin, in the north, down to Reads Landing, Minnesota in the south. The villages of Pepin, Maiden Rock and Stockholm are on the Wisconsin side, while Frontenac State Park takes up a large part of the Minnesota side. The largest city on the waterfront is Lake City, Minnesota.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway now owns the former mainline of the Milwaukee Road on the Minnesota side, and the Burlington Northern's former Burlington Route mainline is lakeside on the Wisconsin side. Both were former racetracks for the premier passenger trains of their owners, and the CP rails still carry Amtrak's \"Empire Builder\" between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest. Lakeside highways are U.S. Route 61 on the Minnesota side, and across the lake Wisconsin State Highway 35 is just inland from the railroad. Both are National Scenic Byways and parts of the Great River Road.\n\nMaiden Rock, on Lake Pepin, is one site said to be the locale where a Dakota woman named Winona leapt to her death.\n\nLake Pepin occupies a valley carved by the waters of Glacial River Warren, which drained Lake Agassiz in a catastrophic flood at the end of the last Ice Age, and to a lesser extent from Lake Duluth, a smaller glacial lake which drained through the present valley of the St. Croix River. When the continental glacier's meltwaters found other outlets to the sea, River Warren was succeeded by the more modest Upper Mississippi, which drains a much smaller basin, and the St. Croix spillway became the present river. Over a long period of time, the deep valley was partially filled with sediments, forming a broad floodplain. In this plain Lake Pepin formed behind a delta comprising sediments deposited into the ancient lake bed by the Chippewa River near the present community of Wabasha at the southern end of the lake. The lake backed up behind this sediment dam as far north as the location of Saint Paul. In the 10,000 years since the lake's creation, ongoing sedimentation into Lake Pepin has caused its upper end to migrate downstream some 80 km (50 mi) to its present location east (river direction south) of Red Wing, Minnesota.\n\nThe process of sedimentation continues at an accelerated rate; particulates carried by the river upstream are deposited when the current slows where the river empties into the lake. Pepin's natural flora are threatened by these increased rates of sedimentation, leading the Lake Pepin Legacy Alliance to call the phenomenon a \"wet desert.\" Some theorize the lake is filling in at a rate of ten times greater than pre-colonization, due largely to increased run-off from farms along the Minnesota River. Other research maintains sediment accumulation is from a more diverse and complicated series of processes, including natural bank sloughing of large amounts of soil from steep river banks, a result of the geography of the area, composition and physical properties of the soil, man-made restriction of river flooding, access to flood plains and wetlands, and forced straightening an deepening of river channels. Research suggests these processes are being heightened due to increasing precipitation due to climate change.\n\nThe lake was first named in a map of New France made by Guillaume Delisle at the request of Louis XIV of France in 1703. The lake was named for Jean Pepin who settled on its shores in the late 1600s after exploring the Great Lakes from Boucherville.\n\nNicolas Perrot erected the first of a number of fur trade posts, Fort Saint Antoine, in 1686. In 1727 René Boucher de La Perrière and Michel Guignas built Fort Beauharnois on the lake. In 1730 it had to be rebuilt on higher ground. Boucher was the military leader and Father Guignas was a missionary to the Sioux.\n\nIn the nineteenth century the lake was used to transport freshly-cut trees for the lumber industry. Cut logs were floated across the lake, from the 1840s often with the assistance of steamboats to counter adverse winds and the sluggish currents in the lake. Large rafts were assembled at Reads Landing at the southern end, and towed downstream to mills at Winona and St. Louis.\n\nIn 1890 it was the site of one of the worst maritime disasters on the Mississippi, known as the Sea Wing disaster when the Sea Wing ferry capsized in a bad storm, killing 98 people.\n\nIn 1922, Lake City native Ralph Samuelson invented the sport of water skiing on the lake, and Lake City is known as \"the birthplace of waterskiing.\" The city celebrates with a festival called Waterski Days every year on the last weekend in June.\n\nPepin, Wisconsin, is the birthplace of author Laura Ingalls Wilder. In \"Little House in the Big Woods\", the first book in her \"Little House\" series, Laura's father visits Lake Pepin in the first chapter and her family visits the lake in the \"Going to Town\" chapter. Laura's family and their covered wagon then cross the frozen Lake Pepin in the chapter \"Going West\", the first chapter of the second book, \"Little House on the Prairie\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1892626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892626", "title": "Pakistani Americans", "text": "Pakistani Americans\n\nPakistani Americans () are Americans whose ancestry originates from Pakistan or Pakistanis who migrated to and reside in the United States. The term may also refer to people who hold a dual Pakistani and U.S. citizenship. Educational attainment level and household income are much higher in the Pakistani-American diaspora in comparison to the general U.S. population. There are an estimated 518,116 self-identified Pakistani Americans, representing about 0.157% of the U.S. population..\n\nImmigrants from areas that are now part of Pakistan (formerly northwestern colonial India) had been migrating to America as early as the eighteenth century, working in agriculture, logging, and mining in the western states of California, Oregon, and Washington. The passage of the Luce–Celler Act of 1946 allowed these immigrants to acquire U.S. citizenship through naturalization. Between 1947 and 1965, only 2,500 Pakistani immigrants entered the United States; most of them were students who chose to settle in the United States after graduating from American universities, according to reports from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. This marked the beginning of a distinct 'Pakistani' community in America. However, after President Lyndon Johnson signed the INS Act of 1965 into law, eliminating per-country immigration quotas and introducing immigration on the basis of professional experience and education, the number of Pakistanis immigrating to the United States increased dramatically. By 1990, the United States Census Bureau indicated that there were about 100,000 Pakistani Americans in the United States and by 2005 their population had grown to 210,000.\n\nPakistani Americans are classified as Asian Americans by the U.S. Census Bureau. Geographically, they are South Asian American.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there were 508,116 U.S. residents of Pakistani descent living in the United States in 2018. This is up 24.18% from the amount of people who reported as such in the 2010 United States Census, which was 409,163. Some studies estimate the size of the Pakistani community to be much higher and in 2005 research by the Pakistani embassy in the US found that the population numbered more than 700,000 people. Pakistan is the 12th highest ranked source country for immigration into the United States.\n\nAbout half of Pakistani Americans are Muhajirs, about 30% have origins in the Punjab Province of Pakistan, and the rest are made up of other ethnic Groups from Pakistan, including Pashtuns, Balochis, Sindhis, Memons, and Kashmiris.\nThe most systematic study of the demography of Pakistanis in America is found in Prof. Adil Najam's book 'Portrait of a Giving Community', which estimates a total of around 500,000.\n\nThis is a list of all 50 states in the U.S. and the District of Columbia ordered by the total estimated population claiming origin from Pakistan according to the 2018 American Community Survey.\n\nThis is a list of all 50 states in the U.S. and the District of Columbia ordered by the estimated concentration of the population claiming origin from Pakistan according to the 2018 American Community Survey rounded to the nearest thousandth of a percent.\n\nThe Greater New York City Combined Statistical Area, consisting of New York City, Long Island, and adjacent areas within New York State, as well as nearby areas within the states of New Jersey (extending to Trenton), Connecticut (extending to Bridgeport), and including Pike County, Pennsylvania, comprises by far the largest Pakistani American population of any metropolitan area in the United States, receiving the highest legal permanent resident Pakistani immigrant population. Within the greater metropolitan area, New York City itself hosts the largest concentration of Pakistani Americans of any U.S. city proper, with a population of approximately 34,310 as of the 2000 United States Census, primarily in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. These numbers made Pakistani Americans the fifth largest Asian American group in New York City. As of 2006, this number had increased to 60,000 people of Pakistani descent said to be living in New York City. This figure additionally rises to a number between 70,000 when illegal immigrants are also included. Pakistan International Airlines served John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens until 2017. While New York City has celebrated North America's largest Pakistan Day parade for decades, New Jersey's first annual Pakistan Day parade was held on August 16, 2015, in Edison and Woodbridge, New Jersey.\n\nSilicon Valley counts highly educated and skilled workers from Pakistan most of whom work in the Information Technology, software development, and computer science sectors, and it has been estimated that some 10,000 Pakistanis work in the Silicon Valley. From 1990 - 2000 the Pakistani population in the San Francisco Bay Area increased to 6,119 which is an increase of 76%.\n\nHistorically pre-dating the modern state of Pakistan, Muslims from the British Raj immigrated in waves starting in 1902 to the west coast, most notably in Yuba City, California, in search of jobs in mining and logging. Some of the oldest American Muslim communities, and largest Sikh ones in America, exist in Yuba City today.\n\nDevon Avenue has a street named after the founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah as well as Mahatma Gandhi to accommodate both the Indian and Pakistani business there.\n\nThere is a large Pakistani population in Texas with estimates numbered around 50,000. They are primarily concentrated around the metropolitan areas of Austin, Dallas and Houston (in the three County areas of Harris, Montgomery and Fort Bend).\n\nThe community is made up of professionals involved in medicine, IT, engineering, large businesses involved in textiles, manufacturing, real estate, management and also smaller ones such as travel agencies, motels, restaurants, convenience stores and gas stations.\n\nNewly arrived Pakistani immigrants mostly settle in cities like New York City, Paterson, New Jersey, Los Angeles, Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, Chicago, Denver and Detroit; like other South Asians, Pakistanis settle in major urban areas. The Pakistani American community are also prevalent in Arizona, Arkansas, Cleveland, Colorado, Connecticut, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New England, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Seattle, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Wisconsin and Utah. Fremont, California has the most Pashtuns in the United States, with many of them emigrating from Pakistan.\n\nTowns and cities in America with the highest percentage of Pakistani ancestry include Madison Park, New Jersey (5.7%), Herricks, New York (4.1% ), Boonton, New Jersey (4%), Lincolnia, Virginia (3%), Stafford, Texas (2%) and Avenel, New Jersey (2%).\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see Epodunk - Pakistani Ancestry by place and Cities with the most residents born in Pakistan== US Census Data ===\nAccording to the 2010 US Census here are the number of Pakistani Households in the following US Counties.\nFrom the above list provided by the US Census 2010 data the following Metropolitan List has been compiled.\nLike the terms \"Asian American\" or \"South Asian American\", the term \"Pakistani American\" is also an umbrella label applying to a variety of views, values, lifestyles, and appearances. Although Pakistani Americans retain a strong ethnic identity, they are known to assimilate into American culture while at the same time keeping the culture of their ancestors. Pakistani Americans are known to assimilate more easily than many other immigrant groups because they have fewer language barriers (English is the official language of Pakistan and widely spoken in the country among professional classes), more educational credentials (immigrants are disproportionately well educated among Pakistanis), and come from a similarly diverse, relatively tolerant, and multi-ethnic society. Many Pakistani Americans tend to associate themselves with Iranic cultures (Pashtun & Balochi) or Punjabi culture.\n\nPakistani Americans are well represented in the fields of medicine, engineering, finance and information technology. Pakistani Americans have brought Pakistani cuisine to the United States, and Pakistani cuisine has been established as one of the most popular cuisines in the country with hundreds of Pakistani restaurants in each major city and several similar eateries in smaller cities and towns. There are many Pakistani markets and stores in the United States. Many of such establishments cater to a broader South Asian audience due to the lack of differences in cuisine. Some of the largest Pakistani markets are in New York City, Central New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Houston.\n\nPakistani Americans often retain their native languages, such as Urdu. As English is the official language in Pakistan and is taught in schools throughout the country, many immigrants coming to the United States generally have a good native fluency for the English language.\n\nMany Pakistanis in the United States speak some of Pakistan's various regional languages such as Punjabi, Saraiki, Sindhi, Balochi, Pashto and Kashmiri.\n\nMost Pakistani Americans are Muslims. Religion figures prominently in many Pakistani American families.\n\nThe majority of Pakistanis belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, although there is a significant representation of the Shi'ite and Ahmadiyya sects. In smaller towns in America where there may not be mosques within easy access, Pakistani Americans make trips to attend the nearest one on major religious holidays and occasions. Pakistani Americans worship at mosques alongside other Muslims who might trace their ancestry to all parts of the Islamic world; there are generally no separate Pakistani American mosques.\n\nPakistani Americans also participate in and contribute to the larger Islamic community, which includes Arab Americans, Iranian American, Turkish American, African Americans, Indonesian Americans, Malaysian Americans, South Asian Americans, and many more ethnic backgrounds in America. They are part of the larger community's efforts to educate the country about the ideals of Islam and the teachings of Mohammed. Pakistani Americans have played important roles in the association the Muslim Students of America (MSA), which caters to the needs of Islamic students across the United States.\n\nAlthough most Pakistani Americans are Muslims, there are also Hindus, Christians, and Zoroastrians within the community. Pakistani Christians, like Asian Christians, worship at churches all over the country and share in the religious life of the dominant Christian culture in America. Pakistani Hindus mainly share in the religious life of numerous Hindus from various nationalities, such as Indian American Hindus. Pakistani Hindus are mostly from Karachi. In recent times, Pakistani Zoroastrians (called Parsis) have come to the United States mainly from the cities of Lahore and Karachi. Apart from fellow Pakistanis, they also congregate with fellow Zoroastrian co-religionists from Iran.\n\nPakistani Americans have made many contributions to the United States in many fields, such as science, politics, military, sports, philanthropy, business and economy.\n\nShahid Khan is a Pakistani American billionaire businessman who is owner of an auto-parts company and an NFL team Jacksonville Jaguars. As of 2012, he was estimated to have a net worth exceeding $6 billion and is featured on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans, on which he ranks 179. Overall on the Forbes list of billionaires, he is the 491st richest person in the world.\n\nThe Pakistani American community is said to be philanthropic, research shows that in the year 2002 the community gave close to US$1 Billion in philanthropic activities (including value of volunteered time). Since the Pakistani diaspora has spread internationally over the years, many Pakistanis living abroad choose to donate time, money and talent to further development in Pakistan. Pakathon, for example, aims to empower Pakistanis through innovation, technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nPakistani-American business tycoon and Philanthropist, Syed Javaid Anwar, from Midland Texas raised by his late mother Ms. Tahira Khatoon (12/22/1928 – 3/21/2015), has shown great excellence as a global citizen as shown by his commitment to many organizations including Habitat for Humanity, University of Texas at Austin, Permian Basin Chapter of the Association of Fundraising Professionals, The Human Development Foundation, and lastly the Pakistani Chamber of Commerce.\n\nPakistani American soldiers make up a sizable proportion of the over 4,000 Muslim service members in the US military. As of February 2008, 125 Pakistan-born service members were on active duty in the US Armed Forces, out of the 826 US service members born in South-Central Asia. This figure refers to those who were naturalized with US citizenship and does not include US-born service members of Pakistani ancestry.\n\nPakistani American service members have assisted with US intelligence operations, and worked as interpreters, interrogators and liaison officers in Afghanistan. Their knowledge of local languages such as Pashto and Dari gives them an edge in coordination activities.\n\n\nShayan Khan, is an American Entrepreneur, Model, Actor, Entertainer and Producer. Khan was awarded the title of Mr. Pakistan World in 2013, and has finished the filming of his first feature film Na Band Na Baarati, in Toronto, Canada on October 17, 2016.\n\n\nThe Pakistani American community generally lives in a comfortable middle-class, upper-middle-class and upper-class lifestyles. Many Pakistani Americans follow the residence pattern set by other immigrants to the United States that when they increase their wealth, they are able to own or franchise small businesses; including restaurants, groceries and convenience stores, clothing and appliance stores, petrol and gas stations, newspaper booths, and travel agencies. It is common to include members of the extended and immediate family in the business.\n\nMembers of the Pakistani community believe in the symbolic importance of owning homes; accordingly, Pakistani Americans tend to save money and make other monetary sacrifices earlier on in order to purchase their own homes as soon as possible. Members of the family and sometimes the closer community tend to take care of each other, and to assist in times of economic need. Hence, it would be more common to turn to a community member for economic assistance rather than to a government agency. This leads to relatively low use of welfare and public assistance by Pakistani-Americans. According to the 2000 census, the mean household income in the United States in 2002 was $57,852 annually, whereas for Asian households, which includes Pakistanis this was $70,047. A separate study conducted by the American Community Survey in 2005, showed the mean and median incomes for Pakistani male full-time workers were US$59,310 and US$42,718 - respectively compared to the average male American full-time workers' mean and median incomes of US$56,724 and US$41,965 - respectively.\n\nThere is also incidence of poverty in the Pakistani community and in particular around the growing number of new immigrants that migrated from less privileged backgrounds in Pakistan. These migrants tend to take low-paying jobs involving manual or unskilled labor and tend to live in large cities where such jobs are readily available and in particular New York, where as of the 2000 census, poverty rates for Pakistanis in relation to the total New York population were higher overall, with 28% of Pakistanis living in poverty, which is greater than the general New York City poverty rate of 21%. Compared with those immigrants that arrived from 1965 who were either professionals or students and considered to be middle- and upper-class, the newer migrants tended to be worse off economically.\n\nAccording to American Factfinder, Pakistani Americans are high achievers academically and tend to be better educated as compared to other heritage groups in the United States with 89.1% being at least high school graduates and about 54% holding a bachelor's degree or higher professional degree. Additionally it was found that over 30% of Pakistani Americans hold graduate or professional degrees.\n\nAn increasing number of Pakistani Americans work in the medical field. The Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America, APPNA, has been meeting in various locations across the United States for the past 30 years. There are more than 17,000 doctors practicing medicine in America who are of Pakistani descent. Pakistan is the fourth highest source of IMG doctors in the U.S. and they are chiefly concentrated in New York, California, Florida, New Jersey and Illinois. Pakistan is also the fourth highest source of foreign dentists licensed in the United States. US congressmen and congresswomen have lauded the contributions of Pakistani medical professionals to the country's healthcare system.\n\nThis table shows the areas of work that Pakistanis are employed in and compares people that are born in the U.S., those born in Pakistan and those who are American nationals:\n\nThe New York Times estimated that there were 109,300 workers born in Pakistan in all occupations in the US in 2007. With the top 10 occupations in ascending order being; sales-related, managers and administrators, drivers and transportation workers, doctors, accountants and other financial specialists, computer software developers, scientists and quantitative analysts, engineers and architects, clerical and administrative staff, and teachers.\n\nSince the September 11 attacks, there have been scattered incidents of Pakistani Americans having been targets for hate crimes and Pakistani Americans have to go under more security checks in places such as airports. Following these attacks, many Pakistani Americans have identified themselves as Indians to avoid discrimination and obtain jobs (Pakistan was created as a result of the partition of India in 1947).\n\nSince the second wave of immigration in 1965, the Pakistani American community has not been politically inclined, but this is now changing, with the community starting to contribute funds to their candidates of choice in both parties, and running for elected office in districts with large Pakistani American populations. In recent times, Pakistani American candidates have run for the state senate in districts of such city boroughs as Brooklyn, New York. Because the community is geographically dispersed, the formation of influential voting blocs has not generally been possible, making it difficult to for the community to make an impact on politics in this particular way. However, there are increasing efforts on the part of community leaders to ensure voter registration and involvement. In 1989, observing the need for greater political coordination, activism and advocacy, a group of Pakistani Americans founded The Pakistani American Political Action Committee (PAKPAC).\n\nHistorically, Pakistani Americans have tended to vote Republican due to the shared ideology of conservatism and the perceived notion that Republican Presidents and leaders are more pro-Pakistani than Democrats. This was evident during the 2000 Presidential Election, as Pakistani Americans voted in overwhelming numbers for Republican candidate George W. Bush. That trend reversed itself in 2004, after George W. Bush's first term in office. His policies alienated Muslims at home and abroad, and Pakistanis were no exception. When George W. Bush was up for re-election, Pakistani Americans voted for Democratic candidate John Kerry. Former Pakistan diplomat Mohammed Sadiq (diplomat) helped establish the internship program at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, D.C. Mr. Sadiq also helped the Pakistani American community organize and launch the Pakistan Caucus in Capitol Hill.\n\nIn the past, especially during the Cold War and the War on Terror under the Bush administration, there was the perceived notion that Republicans were more pro-Pakistani than Democrats. However, that trend reversed itself from 2011 onwards. Since then, there has been an increasing anti-Pakistani sentiment among Republican congressman which has alienated some Pakistani-Americans. Some Republican presidential candidates have criticised the Democrats policy toward Pakistan. During the 2012 Republican Party presidential debates, the Republican candidates questioned whether the United States could trust Pakistan. Texas governor Rick Perry called Pakistan unworthy of US aid because it had not done enough to help fight al-Qaeda. In the same year a bill was introduced by Dana Rohrabacher in the US House of Representatives proposing a hefty reduction in aid to Pakistan. President Obama has vowed to veto any proposed anti-Pakistan bills. President Obama also courted the Pakistani-American community for votes and money for his 2012 re-election campaign. In March 2012, Obama traveled to Houston, Texas for this purpose and at a dinner organised by Pakistani entrepreneurs, the President managed to raise $3.4 million in just a few hours for his re-election campaign. President Obama also pledged to continue sending aid and selling military equipment to Pakistan. According to polls, most Pakistani-Americans have now switched their votes to the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2013, during the second inauguration of Barack Obama, the re-elected President praised the members of the Pakistani community in America and said, “I am about to go speak to the crowd in Chicago, but I wanted to thank you first. I want you to know that this was not fate and it was not an accident. You made this happen.” Talking to the Daily Times via telephone, US business leader Muhammad Saeed Sheikh said Obama in his address told that he would spend the rest of his presidency honoring the Pakistani-American support and doing what he can to finish what he started. Obama continued his praise and said, \"You organised yourselves block by block. You took ownership of this campaign 5 and 10 dollars at a time.

No airlines are allowed to fly nonstop to the US from Pakistan, but several Arab airlines fly indirectly between the two nations, carrying with them thousands of Pakistanis who mostly go home to visit family and relatives. The relationship between the U.S. and Pakistani governments in the past few decades has not been very close, and the Pakistani American community has benefited from this American interest in the country of their origin. Pakistani TV channels have found their way into homes of the diaspora worldwide.\n\nSeveral paid TV channels are available for viewing; Pakistani TV serials, reality TV shows and political talk shows are popular among expatriates. These channels can also be viewed on the internet. Pakistani Americans maintain a deep interest in the society and politics of their country of origin. Funds are raised by the community in the US for various political parties and groups in Pakistan. From all the Pakistani diaspora, Pakistani Americans raised the largest number of funds to help Pakistan due to the 2005 earthquake. Tensions among ethnic groups like the Sindhis, Punjabis, Pashtuns, and Baluchis in Pakistan are not reflected in interaction between these subgroups in the US.\nSeveral international airlines serve the growing Pakistani community in the US connecting major US airports to those in Pakistan.\n\nThe Pakistani community in the United States also remits the largest share of any Pakistani diaspora community since 2002/03, surpassing those from Saudi Arabia which from 2000/01 were $309.9 million and increased to $1.25 billion by 2007/08 and during the same period remittances from the United States increased from $73.3 million to $1.72 billion.\n\nIn 2012 the Election Commission of Pakistan granted Overseas Pakistanis the right to vote in future Pakistani general elections. By allowing the setting up of polling stations in embassies and consulates, this move was welcomed by those Pakistanis living abroad particularly in America who stated \"Overseas Pakistanis make enormous contributions to the development of Pakistan\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pharyngeal slits are repeated openings that appear along the pharynx caudal to the mouth. With this position, they allow for the movement of water in the mouth and out the pharyngeal slits. It is postulated that this is how pharyngeal slits first assisted in filter-feeding, and later with the addition of gills along their walls, aided in respiration of aquatic chordates. These repeated segments are controlled by similar developmental mechanisms. Some hemichordate species can have as many as 200 gill slits. Pharyngeal slits resembling gill slits are transiently present during the embryonic stages of tetrapod development. The presence of gill-like slits in the neck of the developing human embryo famously led Ernst Haeckel to postulate that \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\"; this hypothesis, while false, contains elements of truth, as explored by Stephen Jay Gould in \"Ontogeny and Phylogeny\". However, it is now accepted that it is the vertebrate pharyngeal pouches and not the neck slits that are homologous to the pharyngeal slits of invertebrate chordates. Gill slits are, at some stage of life, found in all chordates. One theory of their origin is the fusion of nephridia which opened both on the outside and the gut, creating openings between the gut and the environment.\n\nIn vertebrates, the pharyngeal arches are derived from all three germ layers. Neural crest cells enter these arches where they contribute to craniofacial features such as bone and cartilage. However, the existence of pharyngeal structures before neural crest cells evolved is indicated by the existence of neural crest-independent mechanisms of pharyngeal arch development. The first, most anterior pharyngeal arch gives rise to the oral jaw. The second arch becomes the hyoid and jaw support. In fish, the other posterior arches contribute to the brachial skeleton, which support the gills; in tetrapods the anterior arches develop into components of the ear, tonsils, and thymus. The genetic and developmental basis of pharyngeal arch development is well characterized. It has been shown that Hox genes and other developmental genes such as \"dlx\" are important for patterning the anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral axes of the branchial arches. Some fish species have jaws in their throat, known as pharyngeal jaws, which develop using the same genetic pathways involved in oral jaw formation.\n\nThe presence of pharyngeal slits in hemichordates led to debates of whether this structure was homologous to the slits found in chordates or a result of convergent evolution. With the placement of hemichordates and echinoderms as a sister group to chordates, a new hypothesis has emerged-suggesting that pharyngeal gill slits were present in the deuterostome ancestor . Intriguingly, extant echinoderms lack pharyngeal structures, but fossil records reveal that ancestral forms of echinoderms had gill-like structures. \nComparative developmental and genetic studies of these pharyngeal structures between hemichordates and urochordates have brought about important insights regarding the evolution of the deuterostome body plan. Comparative molecular biology has revealed that the \"Pax1/9\" genes (which encode for transcription factors) are expressed in similar patterns between hemichordates and urochordates; In vertebrates, \"Pax 1\" and \"Pax 9\" are expressed in the pharyngeal pouches and are important for thymus development. applying excess retinoic acid (excess retincoic acid in vertebrates results in pharyngeal abnormalities) leads to the absence of gill slits in developing Amphioxus, suggesting that retinoic acid may act through the same mechanism in vertebrates and amphioxus. These studies indicate that the pharyngeal slits found in hemichordates and chordates are indeed homologous in a molecular sense.\n"}

These attractions, while different from one another, tell a similar story of a trip to the mythical land of Atlantis. Each one combines roller coaster elements, such as chain lift hills and steep drops, with boat-based attraction elements, such as splash-down landings. All three attractions were designed by Mack Rides of Germany.\n\nThe original \"Journey to Atlantis\" made its debut on April 17, 1998 at SeaWorld Orlando. It is one of the five roller coasters at the park. Along with Wild Arctic, it was one of the park's only thrill rides until the arrival of \"Kraken\" in 2000. The two other roller coasters came after, \"Manta\" in 2009 and \"Mako\" in 2016.\n\n\"Journey to Atlantis\" features a small aquarium exhibit, \"Jewels of the Sea\", in its gift shop exit area. Inside, guests will find aquaria built into the floor and the ceiling of the exhibit, along with more traditional aquaria.\n\nIn March 2017, the ride finished its usual seasonal maintenance but Sea World changed the ride's whole theming, taking out all effects of Allura the evil mermaid and Hermes the Fiber-optic seahorse (audio and lighting).. The musical score and sound effects that once narrated the emotional arc of the ride disappeared too, and The ride's score was replaced with a continuous loop of soothing, ambiant, relaxing music (borrowed from the park's former cirque-style show, \"A'lure – Call of the Ocean\") with generic celebratory Greek music on any exterior parts.\n\nFor a brief period prior to 2017, the Original version of the ride received mixed reviews, with complaints from parents and their families that the ride had infact terrified their children as was considered too scary even for younger kids, and often criticized the ride for its intensity (Much like the Magic Kingdom's former darker attractions \"ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter\" and \"Snow White's Adventures\", at Walt Disney World).\n\nThe ride vehicles on \"Journey to Atlantis\" are boats with wheels on the bottom and on the sides. Each boat carries eight passengers, arranged into four rows with two passengers each. Two lap bars secure both passengers in the row.\n\n\"Journey to Atlantis\" begins as the boat is propelled via friction drives into a water flume meant to resemble an underwater canal. A siren beckons the boat closer until the mythical realm of Atlantis comes into view. The boat enters the city and all appears well, but soon the siren's true form is revealed, and the boat is carried up and out of the temple on a roller coaster chain lift hill. After a left-hand U-turn the boat starts up a second lift hill, entering a dry flume at the top of the hill that carries the boat to the large splash-down drop. The attraction's on-ride camera captures the boat's photograph as it slides down to the water below.\n\nThe boat makes a right-hand U-turn leading to a short drop with a large splash and a final lift hill that leads back into the temple for one final encounter with the siren. At the top of this lift hill, the boat is now on a roller-coaster-type track. The boat escapes from the siren into the darkness, down a spiraling drop to the left before swooping up and landing in a final splash-down pool. The boat makes one final U-turn to the right before returning to the station.\n\nThe second \"Atlantis\" opened in 2004 at SeaWorld San Diego. This version lacks the large interior scenes that the Orlando version includes; but makes up for it with the addition of a much larger roller coaster ride. Also, the boats on this version have individual lap-bars.\n\nRiders advance out of the station slowly onto the chain lift hill that is covered in fog machines, which give the illusion of climbing up water. At the top of the lift hill, riders make a full U-turn on a roller coaster track, which wraps around the elevator tower which stands at a height of 95 feet, while traversing a small hump. This turn offers the riders a view of the main roller coaster portion and parts of the park, in which boats emerge above the U-turn. The boat heads toward the 83 foot tall plunge tower, which bares an arched portico with fountain pouring down directly onto the tracks. The boats slip under, plunging down a flume channel into a pool of water. During the plunge, photos are taken of riders. The boat then makes a left-handed U-turn in the water pool and meanders through the pond gently.The boat then enters the plunge tower building at the base. The building is dark inside. The boats enter a room which lights up dimly and begins to flood. (Water comes through crevices in the wall to achieve the effect). The boats roll out of the room into the darkness and onto a special track that works like an elevator, carrying two boats simultaneously. The elevator rocks from side to side while traveling up, as though being pushed by an ocean current. The elevator stops to reach the maximum height position on the ride's course. The boats drop down a 70-foot, 270° curved drop and rise element, followed by a small block brake section. The boat then drops again into another banked hill, followed by a banked bunny hop which lands into another pool of water. The boats then meander through the pool and up a small lift hill to the loading area. A sliding switch track enables high-capacity, faster loading and unloading process.\n\nThe newest version of \"Atlantis\" opened in 2007 at SeaWorld San Antonio. First announced in August 2006, this version is based on a different model than its cousins. Although initial plans had called for a more elaborate indoor station and \"towers\" to enclose the ride's two turntables, SeaWorld opted to reduce the number of drops and turns. Thus, this version more closely resembles a traditional Shoot-the-Chutes boat ride. It is based on the \"SuperSplash\" devised by Mack Rides.\n\nUpon leaving the station, riders ascend a lift hill. Once at the top, the boat enters one of two turntables that allows riders a 360° view of the park. After one full rotation, the boat is positioned to pass through its reverse camelback backwards. The second turntable provides riders with an additional 360° view of the park before the boat finally dives through a building and into the water. Additionally, SeaWorld added walkways and a \"viewing area\" next to the ride's splash zone and queue, enabling guests the option to get soaked. The boat makes a U-turn before climbing back into the station.\n\n"}

For the latter event, floats are decorated entirely in flowers or other plant material.\n\nParade floats were first introduced in the Middle Ages when churches used pageant wagons as movable scenery for passion plays. Artisan guilds were responsible for building the pageant wagons for their specified craft. The wagons were pulled throughout the town, most notably during Corpus Christi in which up to 48 wagons were used, one for each play in the Corpus Christi cycle.\n\nThey are so named because the first floats were decorated barges on the River Thames for the Lord Mayor's Show.\n\nThe largest float ever exhibited in a parade was a entry in the 2012 Tournament of Roses Parade that featured Tillman the skateboarding bulldog (and some of his friends) surfing in an ocean of water. The water tank held over on a float weighing more than . It broke the previous record for the longest single-chassis parade float, which was set in 2010 by the same sponsor.\n\nThe dogs trained for three months prior to the float's debut at the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 2, 2012. A specially designed “wave” machine was incorporated into the design of the float which created a wave every minute.\n\nMembers of Pasadena's Valley Hunt Club first staged the Tournament of Roses Parade in 1890. Many of the members of the Valley Hunt Club were former residents of the American East and Midwest. They wished to showcase their new California homes' mild winter weather. At a club meeting, Professor Charles F. Holder announced, \"In New York, people are buried in the snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let's hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.\"\n\nAnd so the Club organized horse-drawn carriages covered in flowers, followed by foot races, polo matches, and a game of tug-of-war on the town lot. They attracted a crowd of 2000 to the event. Upon seeing the scores of flowers on display, the Professor decided to suggest the name \"Tournament of Roses.\"\n\nThe Battle of Flowers parade is in San Antonio, Texas is the only parade in the United States produced entirely by women, all of whom are volunteers. The parade is the oldest event and largest parade of Fiesta San Antonio. The original purpose of the parade was to honor the heroes of the Alamo. In keeping with this tradition, participants are asked to place a flower tribute on the lawn of the Alamo as they pass by.\n\nIn the Netherlands, flower parades (called 'Bloemencorso') are a popular tradition. The small country holds some 30 parades, large and small. The world's largest flower parade\nis held every year in Zundertthe eighth day of the fourth lunar month, a small town in the south of the Netherlands. In Zundert, and most other Dutch parades, floats are built entirely by volunteers, where hamlets compete with each other to build the most beautiful float, judged by an independent jury. Most Dutch flower parades are held in August and September and use mainly dahlia flowers. The dahlia fields are kept by volunteers as well.\n\nThe climax of the movie \"Animal House\" (1978) features the protagonists from the title fraternity surreptitiously launching their own float into a parade featuring legitimate entries from many of their rivals. The float, a giant decorated cake adorned with the words \"Eat Me,\" later splits open to reveal the parade-destroying \"Deathmobile\" inside.\n\nIn \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (1986) the titular character jumps onto a float during a parade and sings several karaoke numbers to the crowd.\n\nIn the 2011 film \"Rio\" the titular character uses the Rio Carnival as a decoy to smuggle his bird friends to the airport so they can escape.\n\nMacy's Thanksgiving Day Parade features in several films including Miracle on 34th Street (1947) and it's remakes as well as the 2016 version of \"Ghostbusters\".\n\n"}

Among his creations are the Comic Sans font, and the Trebuchet MS font. Besides text typefaces, he finalized and hinted the font Marlett which has been used for scalable User Interface icons in Microsoft Windows since 1995 and created portions of the font Webdings that was first shipped with Internet Explorer.\n\nConnare studied at Milford High School in Milford, Massachusetts and at the New York Institute of Technology where he received a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts and Photography. He later earned a master's degree in Type Design at the University of Reading.\n\nAfter graduating from the New York Institute of Technology, Connare began working as a photographer for the Worcester Telegram in Massachusetts. In 1993 he created a font pack for Apple and Microsoft, which led to a job with Microsoft. While working for Microsoft, Connare contributed to documents on font production as well as the fonts Trebuchet MS, Webdings, and most notably Comic Sans. Connare left Microsoft in 1999 to work towards his master's degree at the University of Reading in England.\n\nWhile working at Dalton Maag, a typeface design company located in Brixton London, Connare created the Magpie font and designed the Ministry of Sound logo.\n\nWhen Microsoft launched Windows 1995, it featured a new program, Microsoft Bob, that included a cartoon that would talk with speech bubbles. Connare felt that the cartoons in Microsoft Bob needed a less formal looking font; something more suitable for kids. Inspired by DC and Marvel comic books, Connare created Comic Sans in 1994 by using a mouse and cursor to draw intentionally sloppy letters. Microsoft Bob inevitably faded into obscurity, but Comic Sans secured its legacy after quickly getting adopted by the Walt Disney Company.\n\nSoon after Connare created Comic Sans the font was adopted by many notable companies including Apple, BMW, and Burberry. Despite the font's commercial success, it is controversial and its detractors are passionate. The hatred goes so far that a group of Canadians campaigned to ban the font in 2005. Connare has not been deterred by the negative backlash to his creation; in fact, at the Fourth Annual Boring Conference Connare said he found the contempt for his work to be \"mildly amusing\".\n\nComic Sans has become very widely used in applications ranging from newspapers titles and store signs, to the Spanish world cup trophy and the Pope's photo album at the Vatican. Connare has stated that he is very proud of the font, offering different rationales. Arguing that \"Comic Sans does what it was commissioned to do, it is loved by kids, mums and many dads. So it did its job very well. It matched the brief!\" He has also referred to it as \"the best joke I've ever told.\" \n\nComic Sans is a particularly popular font; in fact, Simon Garfield's new book on fonts, “Just My Type”, devotes the first chapter to Comic Sans. Comic Sans is also listed in the book “How to Design a Typeface” by the Design Museum in London, which was reviewed in newspapers across London. Comic Sans has also featured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n\n"}

Her album \"Stadtkind\" was dedicated to the city of Berlin, and she cites the culture of reunified Berlin as one of the main inspirations for her music. She sings in both German and English. Her music is best described as a blend of IDM and Techno music, which is dance-floor oriented and has noticeable experimental elements. She lives in Berlin.\n\nEllen Allien was born and grew up in West Berlin. During 1989, she lived in London where she first came into contact with electronic music. When she later returned to Berlin, electronic music had become increasingly popular in Germany. In 1992, she became resident DJ at the Bunker, Tresor, and E-Werk. She started her own show on the Berlin radio station Kiss FM and created her own record label, calling them both \"Braincandy\". Due to problems with distribution, she gave the Braincandy label up in 1997 and instead began organizing parties with the name, \"Pitch Control\". Allien created the label BPitch Control in 1999.\n\nShe released her first album, \"Stadtkind\", in 2001, and her second album, \"Berlinette\", in 2003. In 2005, after releasing the album \"Thrills\", Allien created a BPitch sublabel called \"Memo Musik\" for minimal tech and minimal house. \"Orchestra of Bubbles\", a collaboration with Apparat, was released in 2006. During the same year, Allien launched her own fashion line, \"Ellen Allien Fashion\".\n\nAfter the minimalistic \"Sool\" in 2008, she released her fifth solo album, \"Dust\", in 2010.\n\nAllien made a brief appearance in the 2009 electronic music documentary \"Speaking In Code\". Then she worked on the music for the dance performance \"Drama Per Musica\", which has been premiered in Paris in March 2011 under the direction of Alexandre Roccoli and Sevérine Rième. The accompanying album \"LISm\" was released in 2013 and, like her DJ sets, unites different musical styles into a homogenous whole.\n\nAlso the successor \"Nost\" sets on variety, however within the electronic spectrum. Thus she returns to her technoid underground roots and stays true to her dancefloor principles after about three decades.\n\nIn 2019 Ellen Allien launched her UFO Inc. label with an EP that features the epic »UFO« which has been on heavy rotation in her DJ sets all summer long. Between »UFO« and the hard-hitting Berlin acid belter »Körpermaschine« on the flipside, the »UFO« EP perfectly captures the energetic hardware sound of Allien’s new imprint, which will be dedicated to a rough and raw approach to techno.\n\nEllen Allien holds residencies in the clubs Nitsa, Barcelona and Circoloco at DC10, Ibiza and is a regular in clubs such as Madrid’s Mondo. She started her already infamous bi-monthly ‘We Are Not Alone’ raves at Griessmühle in her beloved and vibrant native town Berlin that will guest in other cities around the globe too – just as her in-store record shop happenings under the name Vinylism.

He is an Italian-Swiss scientist (born in Naples, Italy) who, after studying chemical processes and the decay of living beings, gains an insight into the creation of life and gives life to his own creature, often referred to as Frankenstein's monster, or often colloquially referred to as simply \"Frankenstein\". Victor later regrets meddling with nature through his creation, as he inadvertently endangers his own life, as well as the lives of his family and friends, when the creature seeks revenge against him. In the novel we are introduced to the character when he is seeking to catch the monster near the North Pole and is saved from near death by Robert Walton and his crew. Some aspects of the character are believed to have been inspired by 17th-century alchemist Johann Conrad Dippel. Certainly, the author and her environment were aware of the experiment on electricity and dead tissues by Galvani and his nephew Aldini or, perhaps, Alessandro Volta at the university of Pavia.\n\nOne of the characters of 's novella \"Le Miroir des événements actuels ou la Belle au plus offrant\", published in 1790, is an inventor named \"Wak-wik-vauk-an-son-frankésteïn\", then abridged as \"Frankésteïn\", but there is no proof Shelley had read it.\n\nThe character of Victor Frankenstein was born in Naples, Italy (according to the 1831 edition of Shelley's novel) with his Swiss family. He was the son of Alphonse Frankenstein and Caroline Beaufort, who died of scarlet fever when Victor was 17. He describes his ancestry thus: \"I am by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.\" Frankenstein has two younger brothers—William, the youngest, and Ernest, the middle child. Frankenstein falls in love with Elizabeth Lavenza, who became his adoptive sister (his blood cousin in the 1818 edition) and, eventually, his fiancée.\n\nAs a boy, Frankenstein is interested in the works of alchemists such as Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Albertus Magnus, and he longs to discover the fabled elixir of life. He loses interest in both these pursuits and in science as a whole after seeing the remains of a tree struck by lightning; however, at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, Frankenstein develops a fondness for chemistry, and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life in inanimate matter through artificial means, pursuing this goal for two years.\n\nAssembling a humanoid creature through ambiguous means, Frankenstein successfully brings it to life, but he is horrified by the creature's ugliness. He flees from his creation, who disappears and, after several negative encounters with the locals, swears revenge on his creator. When William is found murdered, Frankenstein knows instantly that his creation is the killer, but says nothing. The Frankensteins' housekeeper, Justine, is blamed for the boy's death and executed; Frankenstein is wracked with guilt but does not come forward with the truth because he thinks no one will believe his story, and he is afraid of the reactions such a story would provoke.\n\nThe creature approaches Frankenstein and begs him to create a female companion for him. Frankenstein agrees, but ultimately destroys this creation, aghast at the idea of a race of monsters. Enraged, the creature swears revenge; he kills Henry Clerval, Frankenstein's best friend, and promises Frankenstein, \"You have denied me my wedding night - I will be with you on yours!\" The creature keeps his promise by strangling Elizabeth on her matrimonial bed. That same night, Frankenstein's father dies of grief. With nothing else left to live for, Frankenstein dedicates his life to destroying the creature.\n\nFrankenstein pursues the \"fiend\" or \"Demon\" (as he calls his creation) to the Arctic, intending to destroy it. Although he is rescued by a ship attempting an expedition to the North Pole, he dies after relating his tale to the ship's captain, Robert Walton. His creature, upon discovering the death of his creator, is overcome by sorrow and vows to commit suicide by burning himself alive in \"the Northernmost extremity of the globe;” he then disappears, never to be seen or heard from again.\n\nWhile many subsequent film adaptations (notably the 1931 movie \"Frankenstein\" and the Hammer Films series starring Peter Cushing) have portrayed Frankenstein as the prototypical \"mad scientist\", the novel portrayed him as a tragic figure.\n\nPercy Shelley, Mary's husband, served as a major influence for the character. Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley's, as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth, \"Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire\". There is speculation that Percy was one of Mary Shelley's models for Victor Frankenstein; while a student at Eton College, he had \"experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions\", and his rooms at Oxford University were filled with scientific equipment. Percy Shelley was the first-born son of a wealthy, politically connected country squire, and a descendant of Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet of Castle Goring, and Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel. As stated in the novel, Frankenstein's family is one of the most distinguished of the Genevese republic and his ancestors were counselors and syndics. Percy had a sister named Elizabeth; Frankenstein had an adopted sister, named Elizabeth. On 22 February 1815, Mary Shelley delivered a baby two months premature; the child died two weeks later. The question of Frankenstein's responsibility to the creature – in some ways like that of a parent to a child – is one of the main themes of the book.\n\nObsession plays a major role in the development of Frankenstein's character. First, as a child, he is obsessed with reading books on alchemy, astrology, and many pseudo-sciences. Later, as a young man, he becomes enthralled with the study of life sciences - mainly dealing with death and the reanimation of corpses. Finally, after the monster is created, Frankenstein is consumed with guilt, despair, and regret, leading him to obsess over the nature of his creation.\n\nBesides the original novel, the character also appears or is mentioned in other books from pastiches to parodies.\n\n\nIn the 2001 Curtis Jobling book, \"Frankenstein's Cat\", it features Frankenstein, sometime before creating his monster, creating a cat called Nine (named because he was made out of nine cats). This book was later adapted into a television series in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1892700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892700", "title": "Hudson Bay Railway (1997)", "text": "Hudson Bay Railway (1997)\n\nHudson Bay Railway is a Canadian short line railway operating over of track in northeastern Saskatchewan and northern Manitoba.\n\nHBRY was formed by railroad holding company OmniTRAX in July 1997 to purchase former Canadian National Railway (CN) rail lines running north from The Pas on two branches, one to Flin Flon and on to Lynn Lake, the other to Thompson and on to the Port of Churchill on Hudson Bay. Operations began on August 20, 1997.\n\nAt the same time, OmniTRAX also took over the operation and marketing of the Port of Churchill from Transport Canada. Previous owner CN had limited the allowable tonnage to operate on the lines as a result of the light rail and poor track base. However, the HBRY has been able to successfully operate heavier rail cars and longer trains in recent years without difficulty, resulting in increased business to the Port of Churchill and from various mines and pulp mills.\n\nHBRY is a vital transportation link in northern Manitoba, hauling ores and concentrates, copper, zinc, logs, kraft paper, lumber, and petroleum products. Via Rail Canada also uses HBRY tracks to operate its passenger train service between The Pas and Churchill.\n\nMajor customers for HBRY include HudBay Minerals, Tolko, Vale, Gardwine North, Stittco Energy, Farmers of North America, and formerly, the Canadian Wheat Board.\n\nThe line was constructed by an earlier company of the same name. The Hudson Bay Railway was built starting in the early 1900s under Canadian Northern Railway before being taken over by the Government of Canada and completed in 1929. The lines were operated by Canadian National Railway from 1929-1997 before being sold to OmniTRAX.\n\nOriginally, the Hudson Bay port where the rail line was to terminate was to have been Port Nelson, at the mouth of the Nelson River, which drains Lake Winnipeg. During World War One construction of the rail line was suspended, to divert resources to the war effort. When construction was recommenced the decision was made that maintaining a port on the Nelson River would have too many ongoing expenses, and that the port should be relocated to the mouth of the Churchill River.\n\nThe Nelson River has a greater volume of flow, and contains more silt. A channel several miles long would have to be regularly dredged. In addition, the river's mouth was wide, and shallow. An artificial island had been built, to house the pier, with a causeway. The Churchill River's mouth was deeper, clearer, and required less on-going dredging.\n\nThis change of port is the reason the rail line turns almost directly north.\n\nOn July 27, 2005, heavy rains washed out part of the railroad between The Pas and Pukatawagan; all service over the line, including Via Rail trains 690 and 691, was suspended while repairs took place. Service was restored on August 2, 2005, two days ahead of initial expectations.\n\nOn April 1, 2006, the Hudson Bay Railway sold the former CN Sherridon Subdivision, between Sheritt Junction and Lynn Lake, to the three native tribes in the area, who now own and operate the railway, running twice-weekly mixed (passenger plus freight) trains.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, OmniTRAX announced that due to unprecedented flooding, the line was closed indefinitely between Amery and Churchill, pending evaluation of the damages and repairs. Loss of rail service, both passenger and freight, impacted the tourism industry and imposed other costs on Churchill's already fragile economy. Churchill, and other northern communities where cargo must now be delivered by air, faced skyrocketing prices for staples such as groceries and fuel.\n\nDue to a disagreement over what entity was responsible for repair costs, it was uncertain whether the line would ever be repaired. The Canadian government filed an $18 million lawsuit against OmniTRAX for breach of contract. The position of Canada's Natural Resources Minister, Jim Carr, was that \"Omnitrax Inc. had legal obligations to repair the rail line and its tracks, citing a contract that required OmniTRAX to \"operate, maintain and repair the entire Hudson Bay Railway Line in a diligent and timely manner until March 31, 2029.\" The position of OmniTRAX was that the extensive flooding constitutes a \"force majeure\" that excused it from fulfilling the contract.\n\nIn August 2018, the line and port was sold to the Arctic Gateway Group which contracted Cando Rail Services Ltd. and Paradox Access Solutions to begin repairing the line. The Group, a public-private partnership, is 50% owned by Manitoba communities and First Nations, and 50% owned by Fairfax Financial Holdings and AGT Food and Ingredients.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, the Federal Government announced that they would be helping to fund the purchase of the railway, and port facilities, back from Omnitrax. $43 million of the $117 million the Federal Government committed is a grant to help cover operating costs, for the first three years of Arctic Gateway Group's operations.\n\nOn November 1, 2018, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau helped welcome the first train to arrive in Churchill in 18 months. The first passenger train traveled the line a month later.\n\nA train carrying liquid petroleum derailed on September 16, 2018. One member of the train's crew died, and two other crew members were hospitalized. The train consisted of 3 locomotives, and 27 tanker cars. The train was crossing a creek near Ponton, Manitoba when it derailed. Arctic Gateway Group reported no oil was spilled.\n\nThere are two VIA Rail passenger trains a week each way between Winnipeg and Churchill, taking about 45 hours, and one from Churchill to The Pas.\n\n\n\n"}

It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.\n\nThere were no political parties in this election — until the 1903 election, British Columbia politics were officially non-partisan and political parties were not part of the process. This trend began to change in the 1898 and 1900 elections with the appearance of party-designated candidates and some party-declared members; for example, Ralph Smith in South Nanaimo. The political alignments designated at the time of the dropping of the writ did not necessarily have anything to do with the jockeying for power and support once the election returns were in. Therefore, members shown as \"Government\" or \"Opposition\" only ran under that slate and had no necessary allegiances or party loyalties to follow. If a new government formed from the \"Opposition\" slate, as here with Charles Augustus Semlin, there was nothing to say that someone who'd run under the \"Government\" banner might not cross the floor either to join the governing caucus, or actually be invited over to take a cabinet position.\n\nIn the table below, the seating is only as it was when the House convened. The failure of Semlin's government fell on the shoulders of an over-ambitious Joseph Martin by early 1900. He held on to power despite a petition from Members of the House to the Lieutenant-Governor, but the Lieutenant-Governor, Thomas Robert McInnes, continued to support Martin so long as there was no sitting of the House, such that a situation of non-confidence could be proven, even though Martin had only himself and one other member in his caucus. Martin held out for six months, but the inevitable sitting of the House and immediate vote of non-confidence and subsequent election removed him from power and brought in James Dunsmuir.\n\nIt was because of this debacle, born in this election and the ones that preceded it, that party politics was finally introduced to British Columbia for the 1903 election.\n\n"}

The work involves a full orchestra, with particular emphasis on the brass section at climactic moments. The work is narrated with the reading of excerpts of Abraham Lincoln's great documents, including the Gettysburg Address. An orchestra usually invites a prominent person to be the narrator.\n\nConductor Andre Kostelanetz commissioned Copland to write a musical portrait of an \"eminent American\" for the New York Philharmonic. Copland used material from speeches and letters of Lincoln and quoted original folk songs of the period, including \"Camptown Races\" and \"On Springfield Mountain\". \nCopland finished \"Lincoln Portrait\" in April 1942.\n\nThe first performance was by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra on 14 May 1942, with William Adams as the narrator.\n\nTogether with some descriptive comments on Lincoln (\"Abe Lincoln was a quiet and a melancholy man\"), the work contains the following excerpts from his speeches:\nFellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or\ninsignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. (Annual Message to Congress [since the twentieth century, State of the Union], December 1, 1862)\n\nThe dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country. (Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862)\n\nIt is the eternal struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world. It is the same spirit that says 'you toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. (Lincoln–Douglas debates, October 15, 1858)\n\nAs I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy. (Unknown, though in Lincoln's \"Collected Works\")\n\nThat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth. (Gettysburg Address)\n\"Lincoln Portrait\" is scored for speaker and an orchestra consisting of the following instruments:\n\nWoodwinds\n\nBrass\nPercussion\n\nKeyboards\n\nStrings\nNotable narrators of \"Lincoln Portrait\" have included:\n\nJuana Sujo, an Argentine actress resident in Venezuela and an opponent of the repressive regime of Venezuelan President Marcos Pérez Jiménez, was credited with sparking the popular uprising that led to his removal from power. Aaron Copland had come to Caracas to conduct the first Venezuelan performance of \"Lincoln Portrait\" on March 27, 1957. A \"New York Times\" reviewer said it had a \"magical effect\" on the audience.\n\nAs Copland recalled, \"To everyone's surprise, the reigning dictator, who had rarely dared to be seen in public, arrived at the last possible moment.\" On that evening Juana Sujo was the fiery narrator who performed the spoken-word parts of the piece. When she spoke the final words, \"... that government of the people, by the people, for the people (el gobierno del pueblo, por el pueblo y para el pueblo) shall not perish from the earth,\" the audience rose and began cheering and shouting so loudly that Copland could not hear the remainder of the music. Copland continued, \"It was not long after that the dictator was deposed and fled from the country. I was later told by an American foreign service officer that the \"Lincoln Portrait\" was credited with having inspired the first public demonstration against him. That, in effect, it had started a revolution.\"\n\nThe composition was lampooned by Peter Schickele (\"P. D. Q. Bach\") in his piece \"Bach Portrait\" on the album \"1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults\". Another parody, \"A Quayle Portrait\" by Jeff Ehrhart, features quotes from former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle.\n\nNine minutes of the composition, without narration (from a late 1960s recording by the London Symphony Orchestra), plays during the climactic one-on-one sequence between Jake and Jesus Shuttlesworth (played by Denzel Washington and Ray Allen) in the 1998 Spike Lee film, \"He Got Game\". In the film, Jesus Shuttlesworth is a student at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn.\n\n"}
{"id": "1892711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892711", "title": "Patter song", "text": "Patter song\n\nThe patter song is characterised by a moderately fast to very fast tempo with a rapid succession of rhythmic patterns in which each syllable of text corresponds to one note. It is a staple of comic opera, especially Gilbert and Sullivan, but it has also been used in musicals and elsewhere.\n\nThe lyric of a patter song generally features tongue-twisting rhyming text, with alliterative words and other consonant or vowel sounds that are intended to be entertaining to listen to at rapid speed. The musical accompaniment is lightly orchestrated and fairly simple, to emphasise the text. The song is often intended as a showpiece for a comic character, usually a bass or baritone. The singer should be capable of excellent enunciation, to sing the song to maximum effect.\n\nThe word \"patter\" derives from the \"Pater Noster\", or Lord's Prayer, \"which Catholics recited in its original Latin. ... The habit of rushing through the words as quickly as possible gave rise in England to the term 'patter'\".\n\nA form of rapid patter occurred in the parabasis in ancient Greek comedies. The 16th-century French composer F. de Lys published a song \"Secouhez moy\" set in what the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" calls \"a syllabic, patter-song manner\". Rapid patter numbers are heard in Italian opera of the baroque era, specifically opera buffa. Alessandro Scarlatti's 1702 opera \"Tiberio imperatore d'Oriente\" contains an early instance in the duet \"Non ti voglio\". In the view of \"Grove\", syllabic patter songs were among the components of the new comic idiom, developed in the early decades of the 18th century by composers including Pergolesi, Leo, Sarro, Hasse and Orlandini, and they became a basic part of the pre‐classical operatic style.\n\nPatter was used sparingly until the second half of the 18th century, but then became an increasingly familiar feature of comic operas. An example is Bartolo's \"La vendetta\" in Act1 of Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\", which contains the tongue-twisting \"Se tutto il codice\" section near the end. Patter numbers are found in the comic operas of Mozart's contemporaries, Haydn, Logroscino, Piccinni and Paisiello. In 19th century operas patter is prominent in the works of Rossini and Donizetti. In their works, the patter is reserved for the cabaletta section of a multi-part number. The best-known examples are:\n\n\nThe musical scholar Gervase Hughes points to the patter number \"Bin Akademiker\" in Peter Cornelius's \"The Barber of Bagdad\" (1858) as a prototype of the later Gilbert and Sullivan model.\n\nW. S. Gilbert wrote several opera parodies before he moved on to comic operas with Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan was also familiar with Italian opera and included a patter song in his first comic opera, \"Cox and Box\" (1867). George Bernard Shaw, in his capacity as a music critic, praised \"the time-honored lilt which Sir Arthur Sullivan, following the example of Mozart and Rossini, chose for the lists of accomplishments of the Major-General in The Pirates or the Colonel in Patience.\" Well-known examples of rapid-fire, tongue-tripping Gilbert and Sullivan patter songs are:\n\n\nSome numbers in the Gilbert and Sullivan canon are classified as patter songs by aficionados, although they may not contain all of the attributes listed in the definition above. These are often songs telling how the character rose to an undeserved distinguished position, or they may contain a catalogue or list. A similar example is found in the middle section, starting “È questo l'odontalgico”, of Doctor Dulcamara's \"Udite, Udite, o rustici\" in Act 1 of Donizetti's \"L'elisir d'amore\" (1832), a work that Gilbert had burlesqued early in his career in \"Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack\". This was not intended to be sung at great speed and is thus more of a precursor of, for example, \"When I, good friends, was called to the bar\" (\"Trial by Jury\") or \"As some day it may happen\" (\"The Mikado\"), than are the examples of the \"rapid-fire\" patter above. Most of the Gilbert and Sullivan patter songs are solos for the principal comedian in the cast and were originally performed by George Grossmith. Anna Russell's \"How to write your own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera\" contains an affectionate parody of a Gilbert and Sullivan patter song.\n\nApart from Gilbert and Sullivan tunes set to different words, such as Tom Lehrer's listing of the chemical elements to the tune of the Major General's Song, later patter songs can be found in early twentieth-century operettas, such as Edward German's \"Merrie England\" and in a number of musicals. Later examples include \"Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)\" in Ira Gershwin and Kurt Weill's \"Lady in the Dark\", \"Getting Married Today\" in Stephen Sondheim's \"Company\" and \"Ya Got Trouble\" in Meredith Willson's \"The Music Man\".\n\n\n\n"}

The market holds two major shows each year, one in April and another in October, running one week in the Fall, and two weeks in the Spring. There are around 70,000-80,000 attendees from over 100 countries. The High Point Market Authority coordinates the exposition, whose showrooms have nearly completely filled what had been the historic downtown. A 2018 Duke University study showed that the market contributed $6.7 billion to the area's economy.\n\nThe first formal Southern Furniture Market was held in High Point March 1–15, 1909. In 1921, the Southern Furniture Exposition Building opened for its first show June 20. Built in 19 months, the showroom cost approximately $1 million and held of exhibition space. Regular shows were held in January and July. With the exception of 1943, the market was put on hold from 1941 until the end of World War II.\n\nThe $1 million 10-story Wrenn Wing was added to the Southern Furniture Exposition Building in 1950. The center's fourth expansion is connected to older parts of the building by glass walkways over Wrenn Street. During the 1950s, informal \"in-between\" markets began to emerge, hosting visitors in April and October. The main markets were still held in January and July. However, the size and scope of the mid-season marketing during April and October begin to surpass the January and July shows in the 1960s.\n\nIn the 1970s, showrooms other than the Southern Furniture Exposition Building gained stature, both in size and importance. In 1980, organizers in Dallas made a bid to host the major national home furnishings market. In 1982, marking a complete transition, the January and July shows were discontinued, leaving the April and October shows. Also in 1982, Market Square opened in the renovated Tomlinson Chair complex. It is credited with starting the dramatic increase in showroom space that made High Point a major furniture exhibition center.\n\nThe Southern Furniture Market was renamed the International Home Furnishings Market in 1989. High Point's largest showroom, the Southern Furniture Exposition Building, changed its name to the International Home Furnishings Center, or IHFC. With nearly of furniture showroom space already available around the city, a decade-long showroom building boom began. In the 1990s, a construction boom added an additional of showrooms to High Point. Showroom expansion continued in 2000, with the addition of new temporary exhibit spaces: The Suites at Market Square and Showplace. A year later, the 12th floor of the IHFC opened, giving the building of space, more than 14 times its original size.\n\nIn 2001, organizers announced the formation of the High Point Market Authority, the official organizer of the Market. The next year, the Authority approached the N.C. General Assembly for the first time in its history seeking state support for the trade show, the largest event in the state of North Carolina. In 2003, the Market Authority began a massive shuttle service that today \n\nsupports over 300,000 riders per year. The N.C. Department of Transportation set aside $900,000 for each of the next two years so the Authority could offer free shuttles to and from 100 hotels and the Piedmont Triad International Airport, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, and Raleigh-Durham International Airport. In 2005, a new transportation terminal, the Mendenhall Transportation Center, opened in downtown High Point to anchor the Market.\n\nIn 2011, IHFC Acquisition Co. bought the IHFC for $275 million. Bassett Furniture Industries was that company's largest stockholder. SEC reports from Bassett showed a connection with The Related Cos., an investor in World Market Center. The Related Cos. was rumored to be part of a deal which would bring most of High Point's showroom space under one owner, and there were fears that the industry would move more activity to Las Vegas. At a press conference May 3, 2011, World Market Center CEO Bob Maricich and other officials of a new company announced the consolidation of what had been competing showroom facilities. International Market Centers (IMC), owned by Bain Capital and Oaktree Capital, with headquarters in both High Point and Las Vegas, bought the IHFC, Market Square and Showplace, representing about two-thirds of the city's showroom space.\n\nIn a deal completed September 26, 2017, Blackstone Real Estate Partners, Blackstone Tactical Opportunities and Fireside Investments purchased IMC, which at the time owned 14 buildings with 6.7 million square feet in High Point.\n\nToday, the Market's 70,000-80,000 attendees include exhibitors, buyers, designers, and media in the furniture industry. Among the High Point Market attendees transacting business are widely known figures from other arenas who participate in the home furnishings industry, including Martha Stewart, Kathy Ireland, Alexander Julian, Jonathan Adler, Oscar de la Renta, Candice Olsen, Paula Deen, Charles Spencer, and Donald Trump.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the spring event was moved from its intended April 25–29 date to early June as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; it was cancelled April 16.\n\nThe High Point Market has been noted for being a significant part of the region's furniture \"cluster,\" which was discussed by sociologist Richard Florida and initially by economist Michael Porter. The High Point Market has also been the focus of an extensive case study by urban sociologist John Joe Schlichtman. In this research, High Point's ability to capture the global furniture merchandising market is said to signal a new era in what is possible for small cities. Along these lines, he terms High Point a \"Niche City\", which is \"a city that forges global centrality by creating an economic specialization in a specific segment of the global service economy.\"\n\n"}

He was guitarist with The Brogues, then most notably with Quicksilver Messenger Service, where the complex interplay between himself and fellow-guitarist John Cipollina did much to define the unique sound of that San Francisco based band.\n\nBorn in San Diego, Duncan grew up in Ceres, California, where (as Gary Grubb) he played guitar for the Ratz until they finished their performance itinerary as an opening act for the Byrds and the Rolling Stones at the War Memorial Auditorium in San Jose, California. It was in 1965 when, as Gary Cole, he joined the Brogues, in Merced, California, and met future Quicksilver Messenger Service drummer Greg Elmore. It was with the Brogues that he adopted the stage name Gary Duncan. He stayed with them until they broke up in 1965.\n\nIn late 1965 Duncan received a call from John Cipollina offering an audition for himself and fellow Brogues member Greg Elmore to join Quicksilver Messenger Service. The group first performed in December 1965 at The Matrix. The complex guitar interplay between Duncan and John Cipollina had a big influence on the sound of psychedelic rock. In early 1969, after recording two albums, Duncan left Quicksilver and as he describes it, \"I left for a year and rode motorcycles and lived in New York City and Los Angeles and just kind of went crazy for about a year.\"\n\nBy the beginning of 1970 Duncan rejoined Quicksilver Messenger Service along with singer/guitarist Dino Valenti which pushed the group toward a more folk rock sound. By 1971 the original group had splintered with Cipollina, David Freiberg and Nicky Hopkins all leaving while Duncan, Elmore and Valenti continued to perform as Quicksilver Messenger Service until the end of the 1970s.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Duncan revived the Quicksilver name and began touring with his own band even releasing an album, \"Peace by Piece\". He released a few more albums into the 1990s with the Quicksilver name but was the only original member in the group (except David Freiberg who guested on some tracks). He began touring with a four-piece band up until 2001 when the World Trade Center was attacked. After that Duncan recalled there were no more shows to play and he tore down his home studio for financial reasons. He said: \"I tore the Studio apart by myself... no help from any of my friends... in fact not even a word... they all came and got the stuff they had stored and left the stuff they didn’t want so I could haul it away and they just never spoke to me again...\"\n\nDuncan walked away from the music industry for the next few years until 2004, when he began releasing music from his Quicksilver band in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2006 Duncan reunited with Freiberg and began touring again as the Quicksilver Messenger Service. They were still performing up to his death.\n\nOn June 19, 2019, Duncan fell and suffered a seizure and multiple cardiac arrests. He fell into a coma, and died on June 29, 2019 in Woodland, California, never regaining consciousness.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1892738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892738", "title": "Thoth-Amon", "text": "Thoth-Amon\n\nThoth-Amon is a fictional character created by Robert E. Howard. He is an evil wizard in \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", the first of the Conan the Cimmerian stories. He is often used as Conan's arch-nemesis in derivative works, but the two characters never met in any of Howard's original stories.\n\nHoward most likely derived the character's name from the Egyptian deities Thoth and Amon. Thoth-Amon was the foremost sorcerer of the Stygian culture, which Howard set up as the ancestors of the ancient Egyptian civilization. Thoth-Amon was a worshipper of a god he referred to as \"Father Set\". While this must derive from the Egyptian deity Set, Howard transforms him into a serpent god. There is some intimation that Father Set may be one of the Great Old Ones created by H. P. Lovecraft. Howard and Lovecraft were both good friends who often drew inspiration from each other's work.\n\nIn his first, and only, appearance, Howard describes Thoth as \"a somber giant, whose dusky skin revealed his Stygian blood.\"\n\nThe character is one of Howard's most memorable villains and has been used by other authors, notably L. Sprague de Camp. Thoth-Amon was a recurring villain in Marvel Comics' various Conan titles. Several of the sorcerer's accoutrements, \"The Scroll of Thoth\" and \"The Serpent Ring of Set\", have also shown up in other stories by Richard Tierney and others. Though the villain in the film \"Conan the Barbarian\" is named Thulsa Doom, after an evil wizard in Howard's Kull stories, he more closely resembles Thoth-Amon.\n\nThe enduring popularity of Thoth-Amon may be because of his unusual characterization. Though a villain, the sorcerer has many heroic qualities. He is brave, physically strong, intelligent, and devoted to the advancement of his people. He is perhaps the best example of a noble villain.\n\nThoth-Amon only ever appeared directly in one of Robert E. Howard's stories, \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", which was also the first appearance of Conan. In this story, he is temporarily powerless and the slave of an Aquilonian outlaw named Ascalante. It's revealed how Thoth-Amon used to be the greatest wizard of Stygia, until the Serpent Ring of Set was stolen and his powers were removed. The ring is described as \"of a metal like copper, and was made in the form of a scaled serpent, coiled in three loops, with its tail in its mouth. Its eyes were yellow gems which glittered balefully.\" Thoth-Amon regains the ring and his power during the course of the story. His attack on Conan during the story is accidental, when he sends a demon to kill Ascalante and his conspirators who are at that time attempting to assassinate the Cimmerian.\n\nThoth-Amon is mentioned in two further Conan stories. First in \"The God in the Bowl\" (earlier in Conan's career than the first story) and then in \"The Hour of the Dragon\" (later than the first story). In both stories, he is feared as a major Stygian wizard. \"The God in the Bowl\" is the only one of the two in which his actions threaten Conan, although indirectly as in \"The Phoenix on the Sword\". In \"The Hour of the Dragon\", Conan's actions aided Thoth when he destroys a cabal of rival Stygian priests plotting to use against him the Heart of Ahriman, which Conan required for his own ends.\n\nHoward made one more reference to the character in a published work. Set in the modern 1930s, Thoth's Serpent Ring of Set again appears in the John Kirowan story \"The Haunter of the Ring\". This was one of Howard's direct contributions for the Cthulhu Mythos, which was created by his correspondent H. P. Lovecraft.\n\nThe ring is at first described physically: \"Oh, a fantastic thing--copper, made like a scaly snake coiled three times, with its tail in its mouth and yellow jewels for eyes. I gather he picked it up somewhere in Hungary.\" Later in the story, it's directly named as the \"accursed ring of Thoth-Amon, handed down by foul cults of sorcerers since the days of forgotten Stygia.\"\n\nOne further mention of Thoth-Amon exists in Howard's second draft of \"Marchers of Valhalla\", where Ishtar mentions, \"Thoth-Amon, the sorceror of Stygia, hated my father, and to spite him, he put the curse on me of Life ever-lasting!\" As the kingdoms of Lemuria and Stygia existed during different ages of Howard's universe, the explanation for this is unclear.\n\nThoth-Amon frequently appears in various later books, added to the Conan saga by other authors.\n\nIn Sean A. Moore's \"Conan and the Grim Grey God\", Thoth-Amon plays an important role - but is not so much interested in Conan, his attention being focused on a rival sorcerer, younger and even more vicious and ruthless than Thoth-Amon himself. Only in the final scene of the book's convoluted and many-sided plot are Conan and Thoth-Amon in the same place at the same time, and even then both of them are too busy with other opponents while having no attention to spare for each other.\n\nMoore's book portrays Thoth-Amon acting positively and responsibly in a moment of supreme crisis. When Thoth-Amon's bumbling young rival nearly unleashes upon the world an ancient god of Chaos who was responsible for the sinking of Atlantis, Thoth-Amon momentarily lays aside his staunch, age-old enmity with the High Priest of Ibis - the two of them together making an invocation powerful enough to banish this grave threat from the world.\n\nIn \"Conan the Buccaneer\", written in 1971 by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, Thoth-Amon plots to make himself the King of Zingara, suppress the worship of Mitra, and replace it with the human-sacrificing religion of Father Set. At the last moment, Conan succeeds in foiling the plot, partly due to Thoth-Amon having overreach himself by double-crossing his main Zingaran ally. In the end, Thoth-Amon flees while vowing to have his revenge on Conan.\n\nDe Camp and Carter followed this up with four linked stories, written between 1972 and 1975 and later collected in \"Conan of Aquilonia\", which feature a final, all-out confrontation between Conan and Thoth-Amon. It begins with Thoth-Amon forging a worldwide alliance of evil sorcerers, and commencing hostilities by kidnapping Prince Conn, Conan's son and heir. Conn is taken into the witch-ruled region of Hyperborea, and his father journeys northward to find him. Soon, Conan rescues his son and massacres a coven of Hyperborean warlocks. Conan then takes the offensive, relentlessly pursuing Thoth-Amon to the sorcerer's native Stygia and from there to Zimbabwei, while destroying one by one all of Thoth-Amon's magical allies. Thoth-Amon grows weaker and his great age is increasingly evident - but even so, he's still formidable and powerful during the final showdown, on the desolate shore of what would once become the Indian Ocean. It's in fact the young Conn who finally kills his father's old foe - stabbing Thoth-Amon's physical body while the sorcerer was busy in an astral battle with Conan. Conan then throws Thoth-Amon's ring into the sea, crying: \"So end all magical mummery! May it stay at the bottom of the sea for a hundred thousand years!\".\n\nIn the aftermath, Conan muses: \"\"He was the greatest of all the foes I have overcome. I shall miss the old scoundrel, in a way\"\".\n\nIn Dark Horse's new comic series, Thoth-Amon was finally given an origin. Thoth-Amon, the dark wizard began life as young Thoth, a street thief in Memphia, stealing for his father to barely earn a living with perpetual beatings the only sign of affection his father gave. The only person Thoth cared for was his sister, whom he vowed to take away from the cruel city one day. As fate would have it, Thoth's only true friend, a street urchin named Amon, saved the life of Kharantus, priest of Ibis, the feathered god, by calling out a warning of assassins about to assault the priest's litter. Amon was given a boon by the priest and asked to train at the temple of Ibis, though believing himself unworthy to look the holy man in the eye, he kept his head down. That evening, Thoth's private trove of coins was discovered by thieves, who attacked him and stole his money when Amon arrived to tell Thoth the news.\n\nThoth proceeded to murder his friend and take his name, realizing Kharantus would be unable to tell the difference. Thoth became a priest of Ibis, studying alongside Kharantus's son Kalanthes, until he began to lust after more power. Deciding to harness the wisdom of ancient Acheron, Thoth set off on a journey where he entered an ancient tomb and was bitten nearly to death by snakes. There, the God Set came to him and sealed his fate with a dark bargain. Thoth returned to Memphia and began to murder members of Ibis's temple in sickening clandestine rituals, as well as engineering the death of the King and all his heirs to make certain that his and Kalanthes's friend, young Cstephon, would inherit the throne. Thoth's activities were discovered by Kharantus and the two engaged in battle.\n\nThoth defeated the old priest and forced him under mind control to confess to worship of Set, a great crime back then. Kharantus was, through the magic of Ibis, robbed of his mind and kept by Thoth as a servant. Now puppet master of the throne, Thoth set up a vicious dictatorship which fought against numerous rebels, including the barbarian hero \"'Akkad of the Danu\". Kalanthes soon realized what was happening, and with the remainders of Ibis's priesthood, set out to kill Thoth. Thoth's power proved greater than they realized and the priest were defeated. In response, Thoth convinced Cstephon to outlaw all worship of Ibis and turned Memphia to the worship of the serpent god Set. The people, disenchanted with Ibis by the apparent lack of help the feathered god provided them, welcomed it.\n\nThoth intended to have the assassins all killed, but Cstephon decided instead to banish them. Furious, Thoth exposed Cstephon to his dark magic in secret, destroying the young king's mind and making him a thrall. Kalanthes was crucified and left to die in the desert where he was rescued by Akkad of the Danu.\n\nIn an encounter with his past, Thoth recognized a thief brought before him as one of the men who had stolen his treasure horde so many years ago and demanded in return for his release eighteen coins, the exact amount that had been taken from Thoth. The thief was one coin short, so Thoth had him blinded and imprisoned for life. Thoth suddenly recalled the promise to his sister long ago and sent a servant to find his family. soon, Thoth begins to suffer from voices in his head, whispering to him, trying to dissuade him of the path he had chosen. He attempted to ignore them to no avail.\n\nThoth, attempting to unearth Acheron's secrets, accidentally resurrected the ancient sorcerer Xaltoun who brought about the fearsome serpent men on Stygia. Akkad, Kalanthes, and their forces arrived to aid Thoth in battling Xaltoun's army back into oblivion, but Akkad fell in the battle. The battle won, Thoth intended to establish his power even further as Stygia's savior, whereupon Kalanthes sarcastically asked Thoth if he was to go back to the tree now to be crucified again.\n\nTo Kalanthes's fury, Thoth took a moment to think of the question and Kalanthes delivered a savage blow that hurled Thoth to the ground, snarling \"The question was not serious, liar priest, but I am sickened you had to think of the answer. I will take my poor father and leave the city. Perhaps you will learn something. Perhaps not.\"\n\nThoth-Amon was left shivering in a corner, his own weakness exposed.\n\nShortly thereafter, Thoth's servant arrived with the news his family had perished from a plague Thoth himself had unleashed upon the lands. Thoth, no longer caring, decided to use the plague to convert the rest of his citizens into worshiping Set, despite the pleas of the voices in his head, asking if he even cared any longer that he had been responsible for the death of his once-beloved sister.\n\nThe source of the voices was truly Amon, who had been the first of many to die for Thoth-Amon's ambitions. Sadly, Thoth no longer paid him heed, not for many years. Amon, however, still had hope, even for one lost in darkness as his most beloved friend.\n\nWhat became of Thoth-Amon, no tales can truly tell, though he and Kalanthes remained great enemies for many, many years. Some claim he quietly faded into legend, far from fact, some tales claim that he was finally defeated in a savage battle with King Conan himself.\n\nWhatever the truth, many ages after Conan's empire had faded into legend, the chronicles of the Barbarian King were uncovered by a prince and his Wazir... a mysterious Wazir dressed in Stygian clothing, with emerald, serpent-like eyes who was noticeably uncomfortable about the mention of Conan and was heard to remark \"Always Barbarians, everywhere I turn... is there no end to them?\"\n\nThoth-Amon plays the role as main antagonist in the MMORPG \"Age of Conan\". Players start out marked and enslaved by Thoth-Amon, but are purged by ancient magic and are given the chance to break free from his control. Only a group of the strongest players are strong enough to confront him.\n\nA character heavily based on Thoth-Amon appears in the first film \"Conan the Barbarian\", while a character with the name Thoth-Amon (though otherwise not based on the original character) appears in the second film \"Conan the Destroyer\".\n\nThe villain in the film \"Conan the Barbarian\", Thulsa Doom, is essentially the same character as Thoth-Amon from Howard's stories. Though the name Thulsa Doom is taken from another of Howard's characters, the film character is much more heavily based on Thoth-Amon and has little similarity to the original Thulsa Doom character.\n\nConfusingly, a character with the name Thoth-Amon appears in the sequel film \"Conan the Destroyer\". However, the name is the only link to the original character. This Thoth-Amon does not appear, in terms of character, clothing, or setting to be Stygian/Egyptian nor do his actions resemble anything in Howard's stories. The monster Conan faces in Thoth-Amon's fortress (an ape-like creature in a red cloak) does resemble the character Thak from the short story \"Rogues in the House\", but this story does not include Howard's Thoth-Amon.\n\nIn \"Conan the Adventurer\", the central villain Wrath-Amon is likely based on Thoth-Amon. However, unlike Thoth-Amon, Wrath-Amon is a Serpent Man who took the Black Ring and became Set's New High Priest, although he used to serve Ram-Amon. Ram-Amon also suspiciously resembled Thoth-Amon, suggesting a possible split of the character.\n\nAlternatively, the Howard story, \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", includes the line \"Men spoke of Thoth-Amon as they spoke of Rammon\". The similar name of another feared Stygian wizard may have been the inspiration for Ram-Amon instead.\n"}

He was the first New Zealand-born prime minister, holding office in a caretaker capacity following the death of William Massey.\n\nBell was born in Nelson. His father, Sir Dillon Bell, was also a politician. Bell attended Auckland Grammar School and Otago Boys' High School before going on to St John's College, Cambridge. He returned to New Zealand to practise law, settling in Wellington and eventually becoming president of the New Zealand Law Society. Bell served as Mayor of Wellington from 1891 to 1893 and from 1896 to 1897. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1893, after two previous defeats, but served only a single term before retiring in 1896 to return to the legal profession.\n\nIn 1912, Bell was appointed to the Legislative Council as a representative of the Reform Party. In the Reform Government under William Massey, he served as Minister of Internal Affairs (1912–1915), Minister of Immigration (1912–1920), Attorney-General (1918–1926), Minister of Health (1919–1920), and Minister of External Affairs (1923–1926). When Massey died in office in 1925, Bell – aged 74 – was commissioned as his replacement for 16 days while the party elected a new leader (Gordon Coates). Bell retired from politics the following year. Only Henry Sewell served a shorter term as prime minister, and only Walter Nash served as prime minister at a greater age.\n\nBell was born in Nelson, the eldest son of Sir Dillon Bell. His mother was Margaret Hort (who was Jewish, but became a Christian). Arthur Bell was a younger brother. He attended Auckland Grammar School and Otago Boys' High School. At Otago Boys he was the Dux. After finishing high school, he travelled to England where he attended St John's College, Cambridge, receiving a BA in 1873. On returning to New Zealand, he began practising law in Wellington, being involved in Bell, Gully, MacKenzie and Evans. As a youth in the 1870s, he also played two first-class cricket matches for Wellington.\n\nBell served as Crown Solicitor in Wellington from 1878 to 1890, and from 1902 to 1910. He was a prominent member of both the local and national law societies. He served as the latter's president from 1901 to 1918.\n\nHe married Caroline Robinson on 24 April 1878 at St John's Church in Christchurch. She was the third daughter of William Robinson. They had four daughters and four sons. His son William Henry Dillon Bell (1884–1917) was a Member of Parliament, but resigned and volunteered for service in World War I. He was killed in 1917. Another son Cheviot Wellington Dillon Bell was appointed to the Legislative Council as a member of the suicide squad by the First National Government on 27 July 1950 to vote for the abolition of the Council, so served to 31 December 1950. The two children of his brother Alfred, Brenda and Frank Bell, became notable radio pioneers.\n\nHis political career began with being elected Mayor of Wellington in 1891, 1892 and 1896. In his first general election in , he was defeated running as an independent for the electorate. He was narrowly defeated by William McLean in an by-election by 3388 votes to 3245. He finally entered Parliament in the , serving for one term.\n\nIn 1912, the Reform Party came to power, and on 10 July 1912 Bell was appointed to the Legislative Council. He became Minister of Internal Affairs (1912–1915), and Minister of Immigration (1912–1920). He was Attorney-General (1918–1926). He was the first Commissioner of State Forests, and from 1923 he would also serve as the Minister of External Affairs.\n\nHe represented New Zealand at the League of Nations in 1922. He would also attend the allied conferences at Genoa and the Hague.\n\nHaving been appointed Knight Commander on 3 June 1915, on 1 January 1923 he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George and was appointed to the Privy Council on 1 February 1926.\n\nOn returning to New Zealand, Bell became Acting Prime Minister while William Massey was in London. Massey's health began to fail, and Bell took over most of his roles. He officially became prime minister on 14 May 1925 after Massey's death on 10 May. He served as prime minister for the next 16 days. Bell declined the party's offer to become Prime Minister and was replaced by Gordon Coates.\n\nAfter giving up his portfolios in 1926, he returned to the League of Nations with Coates.\n\nIn 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. His wife, Caroline (born 1853), died in Wellington on 8 September 1935. Bell died in Wellington on 13 March 1936.\n\n\n"}

It was formed from scratch, with the majority of its original cadre coming from replacement units and conscripts, many of whom were Romanian Germans and French volunteers. The division was granted the honour-title \"Götz von Berlichingen\". Obersturmbannführer Otto Binge oversaw the formation of the division, with the newly promoted Brigadeführer Werner Ostendorff taking command in January 1944. The \"Götz von Berlichingen\" was placed under the LXXX Army Corps, a part of Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt's \"Heeresgruppe D\".\n\nAs part of a plan to number all named SS divisions in early 1944, the division was re-titled the \"17th SS-Panzer-Grenadier-Division \"Götz von Berlichingen\"\". In February 1944, the division still lacked vehicles. During the same year, on the orders of LXXX Army Corps, the division began to round up French vehicles in an attempt to complete its mobilization. By March, most of the major combat formations were fully motorised, although two of the six infantry battalions were still on bicycles. On 1 June, the \"Götz von Berlichingen\" found itself at Thouars in France, with no tanks (although the crews were fully equipped with 42 \"Sturmgeschütz IV\" assault guns), only a few months' training, and below strength in officers and NCOs.\n\nAfter the Allied invasion of June 6, 1944, the \"Götz von Berlichingen\" was ordered to Normandy to take part in the efforts to reduce the Allied beachhead. On June 10 the Division made contact with 182 paratroopers of the 3rd Battalion, 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, part of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, and B Company, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, at the village of Graignes. This small group of paratroopers had been dropped mistakenly by the U.S. 9th Army Air Force Troop Carrier Command and had decided to try and hold their positions. The ensuing battle, and the criminal execution of wounded paratroopers and French civilians by the \"Götz von Berlichingen\", has since been known as the Battle of Graignes. On June 11 the reconnaissance battalion engaged in combat near the town of Carentan with the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division.\n\nThe Americans secured the town and were advancing south by the morning of June 13.\n\n\"SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 37\", supported by the assault guns of the division's Panzer battalion and \"Oberst\" (colonel) Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte's 6th \"Fallschirmjäger\" Regiment, attacked the advancing paratroopers. In what the Americans dubbed the Battle of Bloody Gulch, the Germans routed two paratroop companies before their attack was stopped by the arrival of Combat Command A of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division.\n\nFor the rest of the month, the division was engaged in heavy fighting for the bocage country near Saint Lô and Coutances. During this period, the \"Götz von Berlichingen\" suffered heavy losses and by the beginning of July, its strength was reduced to 8,500 men. The division was in the line of advance for Operation \"Cobra\", and suffered heavy losses attempting to halt the Allied offensive. It was encircled by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division around Roncey where it lost most of its armored equipment. It was then ordered to take part in the Mortain Offensive, codenamed Operation \"Lüttich\". After the failure of this offensive, the division was split into four \"Kampfgruppen\", 'Braune', 'Gunter', 'Fick' and 'Wahl'. These small units managed to escape encirclement in the Falaise Pocket, but suffered heavy losses and remained in almost constant combat against the advancing Americans until the end of the month, when the division was transferred to Metz for a much-needed rest and refit.\n\nIn July the reserve battalion of the division was involved in counterinsurgency action against Operation Bulbasket in the Vienne Department.\n\n In early September, the division absorbed what was left of the SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 49 and SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 51, raising its infantry strength. However, replacements for missing tanks and assault guns arrived slowly. On September 8, the division was put back into the line and was tasked with destroying the newly formed bridgehead over the Moselle River held by the US 5th and 80th Infantry Divisions. After heavy fighting for the American bridgeheads at Dornot and Arnaville, the division fell back and began to prepare to defend Metz itself.\n\nOver the next two months, the division saw heavy fighting to the south and east of Metz, suffering very heavy casualties. On November 8, a USAAF air raid hit the divisional command post. With the \"Götz von Berlichingen\"'s combat units in tatters (the 38th SS Regiment had been reduced to a strength of about 800 men by November 15, 1944) and with no command structure, Hitler authorized the division to withdraw from Metz. The 38th SS Regiment was largely destroyed at Metz and reformed in November with troops from the SS training regiment \"Kurmark\". The remnants of the division pulled back to the Maginot Line, near Faulquemont to rest and refit. During this time, the \"Götz von Berlichingen\" was transferred to \"SS-Gruppenführer\" Max Simon's XIII SS Corps. US forces liberated Metz on November 22, 1944.\n\nElements of the 38th SS Regiment defended Hilsprich against an advance of the American 35th Infantry Division on November 23. In the same defensive maneuver, the 38th Regiment succeeded in cutting up two American rifle companies that made an ill-advised attack against stronger German forces. Hilsprich fell to another, better supported, American attack the following day. During November 28/29, elements of the 17th SS Division successfully defended Farébersviller against an attack by the US 80th Infantry Division. By December 1, the SS division was deployed along a line extending from the Rosselle River to just south of Puttelange. The \"Götz von Berlichingen\" was caught by surprise when US forces attacked again on December 4, capturing both Farébersviller and Puttelange. Seriously weakened, the SS division fell back to Sarreguemines, which it defended for five days before the town's occupation by US forces on December 11, 1944.\n\nThe 17th SS Division subsequently retreated across the German border and went into a defensive posture along the Blies River. Attacks by the US 35th Infantry Division against this line started December 12, resulting in heavy fighting for the control of Habkirchen, (southeast of Frauenberg) and the high ground overlooking the valley of the Blies. The US 134th Infantry lost half its strength in this clash with the 17th SS Division, but captured Habkirchen by December 15. Under serious pressure because of infantry losses, the SS division was granted a reprieve when the Americans moved into a defensive posture on December 18. The Ardennes Offensive by Germany had begun to the north and US units from General George Patton's Third Army were ordered to either hold fast or move north to assist in the defense of the Ardennes.\n\nWhen the division pulled back to the Maginot Line in mid November, its strength had been reduced to around 4,000 men (of which about 1,700 were infantry) and 20 armored vehicles. Throughout the early days of December 1944, the \"Götz von Berlichingen\" received resupply and reinforcement. Although the armored strength was only 17 assault guns by December 10, a further 17 were sent from Germany on December 28. The \"Panzergrenadier\" regiments were brought up to full strength with the addition of \"Volksdeutsche\" replacements. The quality of these replacements was far below that of the division's original elements. Despite this, at least on paper, the division was back up to strength by the end of 1944.\n\nAs a part of Simon's XIII SS Corps, the division participated in Operation \"Nordwind\", the ill-fated last German offensive in the West. The \"Götz von Berlichingen\", together with 36th \"Volksgrenadier Division\", attacked the US 44th and 100th Infantry Divisions around the town of Rimling. For this attack, the division had been reinforced with a Panther tank company from the 21st Panzer-Division, the 352nd and 353rd flame-thrower tank companies (equipped with Flammpanzer 38(t)s), and the 653rd Heavy \"Panzerjäger Battalion\" (equipped with Jagdtigers). The German attacks did not gain much ground, possibly because of the extreme weather conditions during the offensive. After engaging in heavy combat with the U.S. 7th Army, with little success and having the divisional commander replaced five times, the majority of the divisional staff was relieved on January 3. Replacements, in the form of Army officers, were received the next day. On January 10, the divisional commander, \"Standartenführer\" Hans Lingner, was captured by a patrol from the 114th Infantry Regiment, 44th Infantry Division, when his car overturned on the slippery roads. The driver was shot on the spot; Lingner, his aide-de-camp \"Untersturmführer\" Jund, and another of his staff were brought to the US lines where they were interrogated. \"Oberst\" Gerhard Lindner, one of the Army officers recently transferred to the division, took command on January 15. The division remained engaged with the divisions of the US XV Corps until Operation \"Nordwind\" ended on January 30, 1945.\n\nThe \"Götz von Berlichingen\" took part in the defense of the 'West Wall' until March 18, 1945, when the Americans broke through. At this time its armored vehicle strength comprised 62 assault guns (of which 47 were operational) as well as two Panzer IV tanks. On March 22, division commander \"SS-Oberführer\" Fritz Klingenberg was killed in action. That day, the division abandoned all its vehicles and began to retreat, but only some 500 to 600 men escaped US encirclement in the Pfaelzer Forest and reached Wiesloch on the east bank of the Rhine.\n\nBy April 1, the division's strength was rebuilt to roughly 7,000 men. It then took part in the Battle of Buchhof and Stein am Kocher and the Battle of Heilbronn. Subsequently, the division defended the Jagst and Tauber River valleys, as well as Bad Mergentheim. Although greatly reduced in numbers, it took part in the defense of Nuremberg, where the 38th SS Regiment was destroyed by April 20. The rest of the division continued fighting until the 24th, and then fell back to Donauwörth on the Danube.\n\nThe last organized engagement fought by the division was on April 29, 1945, at Moosburg, Germany. It was there that the division's commander attempted to use Stalag VII-A, the largest POW camp in Germany, as a sort of hostage to buy time to escape across the Isar River. Their effort was frustrated when the commander of the 14th Armored Division learned of the plan, and ordered his Combat Command A to take Moosburg, capture the bridge across the Isar River, and most importantly, secure and protect the Allied Prisoners of War. The American infantry and tank force advanced to Moosburg, and without delay attacked the defensive positions of the 17th \"SS Panzergrenadier\" Division in front of the town. It fell following a brief, but ferocious battle. That same day the 14th Armored Division took over 7,000 German POWs, mostly SS.\n\nOn May 5, five days after Hitler's suicide, and three days before Nazi Germany's surrender, elements of the division attacked the 13th-century castle Itter Castle in Tyrol, Austria. Castle Itter (administratively a part of the Dachau concentration camp complex) was a prison for high-ranking French VIPs, the so-called \"Ehrenhäftlinge\" (\"honor prisoners\"), including politicians Paul Reynaud and Édouard Daladier, labor leader Léon Jouhaux, and former commanders-in-chief Maxime Weygand and Maurice Gamelin. The SS force wanted to execute all such prisoners. The attack was defeated by the 23rd Tank Battalion of the US 12th Armored Division under the command of Captain John C. 'Jack' Lee, Jr., the former prisoners themselves, and anti-Nazi elements of the \"Wehrmacht\" under the command of Major Josef 'Sepp' Gangl, who died in the battle.\n\nThe remaining members of the division surrendered to the US 101st Airborne Division at Rottach-Egern, south of Kufstein, on May 6, 1945.\n\n\"The following are individuals of the 17th\" SS Panzergrenadier Division Gotz von Berlichingen \"who were accused and convicted of war crimes\"\nErwin Schienkiewitz\nCase Nr.: 11-18 (U.S. vs. Erwin Wilhelm Konrad Schienkiewitz)\nFile Number: US0018\nReview Date: 470404\nErwin Wilhelm Konrad Schienkiewitz, an SS officer of the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division 38th Regiment, was accused of participation in the execution of two American airmen out of a group of seventy.

During his NHL career, Corson battled both ulcerative colitis and, as detailed in the October 22, 2001, issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", panic attacks. He last played in the 2003–04 season. Despite some speculation to the contrary, Corson did not return to the NHL after the 2004–05 lockout and is now retired.\n\nCorson was born in Midland, Ontario. As a youth, he played in the 1979 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Barrie. He played in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for the Brantford Alexanders (1983–1984) and Hamilton Steelhawks (1984–1986). The Montreal Canadiens drafted him in the first round, eighth overall, of the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. He played briefly with the Canadiens in the 1985–86 season, then joined the team full-time the following year.\n\nCorson was a regular contributor for the Canadiens from 1986 until 1992, when he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Vincent Damphousse. He played with Edmonton for three full seasons before joining the St. Louis Blues. His time in Edmonton was marred by some controversy, as head coach George Burnett chose him as the team's captain during the 1994–95 season (Jan.-Mar.1995). Burnett would later strip Corson of the captaincy. He was signed by the Blues as a free agent in 1995, and the Oilers received the rights to Curtis Joseph as compensation. During the 1996–97 season, the Blues traded him back to Montreal, where he played until 2000. The Toronto Maple Leafs then signed him as a free agent, and he spent three full seasons in Toronto before \"resigning\" in the middle of the post-season partly because of his ulcerative colitis.\n\nIn a particularly fierce 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs' series against the New York Islanders, Corson was involved in a fight with Eric Cairns, with Cairns being the clear winner of the bout. During the official's attempt to separate Cairns and Corson after the fight, Corson attempted to kick Cairns. The NHL subsequently suspended Corson for the deciding seventh game of the series. The Dallas Stars signed him during the last part of the 2003–04 season in order to add some grit and leadership for their playoff run, but the team was unsuccessful (losing in the first round to the Colorado Avalanche), and Corson retired afterwards.\n\nShayne Corson captained two NHL clubs during his 19-season professional career. He has also played for Canada at the Canada Cup, World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, World Cup of Hockey and 1998 Winter Olympics. Corson was known as a gritty player, with good instincts both offensively and defensively, and a good leader. Corson represented his teams three times at the NHL All-Star Game. He scored 693 points and earned 2357 penalty minutes during his 1,156-game regular season NHL career. In addition, he scored 87 points and earned 291 penalty minutes in 140 playoff games.\n\nCorson suffers from ulcerative colitis, a chronic digestive disorder that can cause severe pain and significant weight loss. During the later stages of his career, Corson began to suffer from panic attacks, a condition he has not attributed to any single event, but which may have been precipitated by his battles with colitis and the premature death of his father, Paul Corson, from throat cancer in 1993.\n\nCorson's sister Shannon is married to former Toronto Maple Leaf teammate Darcy Tucker. In retirement, Corson (often with Tucker) has been a prominent proponent of building a cancer care facility, the Simcoe-Muskoka Regional Cancer Centre, as part of Barrie's Royal Victoria Hospital.\n\nCorson opened his first restaurant in 2007 with partner Armando Russo in the Distillery District of Toronto, called Tappo Wine Bar & Restaurant. They opened a second restaurant in Barrie, Ontario, named Corson's, which began as a family restaurant but was converted to a sports bar and grill which displays his jerseys and other hockey memorabilia but has since closed. (Mom's Pantry, an older restaurant in Barrie, was opened by Shayne Corson's father but is no longer run by the Corson family.)\n\n\n\n"}

In 2005, Hannes organised a regional meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in Iceland, devoted to \"Freedom and Property in the 21st century\".\n\nIn 1984, from October 2 to 10, Hannes, with Kjartan Gunnarsson, operated an illegal radio station, to protest against the government monopoly of broadcasting. Police eventually closed the station down. Hannes and Kjartan were indicted and fined for breaking the law on broadcasting. But the operation of the station and its closure turned many in the leadership of the Independence Party towards supporting the abolition of the government monopoly. The Icelandic parliament abolished the monopoly in 1985, and the law came into effect in 1986.\n\nIn early 1990, Hannes published a book on fisheries management, an important subject in Iceland whose main export is fish. It was entitled \"The Fish Stocks in the Icelandic Waters: The Property of the Nation or of the State?\" Hannes advocated a system of individual, transferable quotas, ITQs, in the Icelandic fisheries, where initially the quotas would be given free of charge to the owners of fishing vessels, in order to gain their support for what was tantamount to the enclosure of the Icelandic fishing grounds. The leadership of the Independence Party also supported the ITQ system. The Independence Party held the Ministry of Fisheries 1991–2009.\n\nIn 2002, Hannes published a book titled \"How Can Iceland Become the Richest Country in the World?\"suggesting that Iceland could become an international financial centre offering low corporate taxes and a stable political environment. He named, as precedents, Luxembourg and Ireland – two other small European countries— and small islands, such as the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Caymans.\n\nThe corporate incomes tax in Iceland has already been lowered in the 1990s from 50% to 18%, and the net wealth tax had been abolished. The free-market reforms under the reign of the Independence Party 1991–2004 were comprehensive, not only consisting in tax reductions, but also in privatization, liberalization and stabilization. Enjoying access to the European financial market because of Iceland's membership of the EEA and also enjoying the high credit ratings for Icelandic companies earned in the 1991–2004 period, the Icelandic banks could expand rapidly, especially in the period after 2004. In the 2008 international financial crisis, the Icelandic Central Bank, since 2005 under the governorship of Davíð Oddsson, was refused credit lines from the US and Europe, with the result that the banks collapsed. It was argued that the Icelandic bank collapse was also a collapse of the neo-liberal model imposed on Iceland by Hannes and Davíð Oddsson. Hannes, however, points out that the Icelandic banks were subject to the same legal and regulatory framework as other banks in the EEA, and that their rapid credit expansion mostly took place after 2004.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1892802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892802", "title": "Imperial Crown of Russia", "text": "Imperial Crown of Russia\n\nThe Imperial Crown of Russia, also known as the Great Imperial Crown, was used by the monarchs of Russia from 1762 until the Russian monarchy's abolition in 1917. The Great Imperial Crown was first used in a coronation by Catherine the Great, and it was last worn at the coronation of Nicholas II. It was displayed prominently next to Nicholas II on a cushion at the State Opening of the Russian Duma inside the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg in 1906. It survived the 1917 revolution and is currently on display in Moscow at the Kremlin Armoury's State Diamond Fund.\n\nBy 1613, when Michael Romanov, the first Tsar of the Romanov Dynasty, was crowned, the Russian regalia included a pectoral cross, a golden chain, a barmas (wide ceremonial collar), the Crown of Monomakh, sceptre, and orb. Over the centuries, various Tsars had fashioned their own private crowns, modeled for the most part after the Crown of Monomakh, but these were for personal use and not for the coronation.\n\nIn 1719, Tsar Peter the Great founded the earliest version of what is now known as the Russian Federation's State Diamond Fund. Peter had visited other European nations, and introduced many innovations to Russia, one of which was the creation of a permanent fund (фонд) to house a collection of jewels that belonged not to the Romanov family, but to the Russian State. Peter placed all of the regalia in this fund and declared that the state holdings were inviolate and could not be altered, sold, or given away—and he also decreed that each subsequent Emperor or Empress should leave a certain number of pieces acquired during their reign to the State, for the permanent glory of the Russian Empire.\n\nFrom this collection came a new set of regalia, including eventually the Great Imperial Crown, to replace the Crown of Monomakh and other crowns used by earlier Russian Tsars and Grand Princes of Muscovy, as a symbol of the adoption of the new title of Emperor (1721).\n\nThe court jeweller Ekart and Jérémie Pauzié made the Great Imperial Crown for the coronation of Catherine the Great in 1762. The beautiful crown reflects Pauzié's skilled workmanship. It is adorned with 4936 diamonds arranged in splendid patterns across the entire surface of the crown. Bordering the edges of the \"mitre\" are a number of fine, large white pearls. The crown is also decorated with one of the seven historic stones of the Russian Diamond Collection: a large precious red spinel weighing 398.72 carats (79.744 g), which was brought to Russia by Nicholas Spafary, the Russian envoy to China from 1675 to 1678. It is believed to be the second largest spinel in the world.\n\nIn formally adopting the Western term \"Emperor\" for the ruler of Russia, Peter the Great also adopted Western imperial symbols, including the form of the private crowns (\"Hauskrone\") used by the Holy Roman Emperors (of which the only surviving example is the Austrian imperial crown of Rudolf II, the Imperial Crown of Austria), in which a circlet with eight fleur-de-lis surrounds a mitre with a high arch extending from the front to the back fleur-de-lis. Already in Austria some baroque representations of this type of crown found on statues of the saints had already transformed the two halves of the mitre into two half-spheres, and this is the type of imperial crown used in Russia. Peter’s widow and successor, Catherine I, was the first Russian ruler to wear this form of imperial crown. \n\nIn the Great Imperial Crown which the court jewellers Pauzié and J. F. Loubierin made for Catherine II in 1762, these hemispheres are in open metalwork resembling basketwork with the edges of both the hemispheres bordered with a row of 37 very fine, large, white pearls. They rest on a circlet of nineteen diamonds, all averaging over in weight, the largest being the large Indian pear-shaped stone of 12⅝ cts in front, set between two bands of diamonds above and below. Posier showed his creative genius by replacing the eight fleur-de-lis with four pairs of crossed palm branches, while the arch between them is made up of oaks leaves and acorns in small diamonds surrounding a number of large diamonds of various shapes and tints running from the front pair of crossed palms to the back pair of crossed palms, while the basketwork pattern of the two hemispheres are divided by two strips of similar oak leaves and acorns from the two side pairs of palm branches stretching up to the rows of large pearls on their borders. At the center and apex of the central arch is a diamond rosette of twelve petals from which rises a large red spinel, weighing 398.72 carats (79.744 grams), one of the seven historic stones of the Russian Diamond Collection, which was brought to Russia by Nicholas Spafary, the Russian envoy to China from 1675 to 1678. It is believed to be the second largest spinel in the world. This spinel, in turn, is surmounted by a cross of five diamonds, representing the Christian faith of the Sovereign, the God-given power of the monarchy and the supremacy of the divine order over earthly power. Except for the two rows of large white pearls the entire surface of the crown is covered with 4936 diamonds and is quite heavy, weighing approximately nine pounds (by contrast, the Crown of Monomakh weighs only two pounds). It was unfinished in time for Catherine's coronation and the original colored stones (e.g., emeralds in the palm branches and laurel leaves) were replaced with diamonds for the coronation of Paul I in 1797. It was used at every subsequent coronation until that of Nicholas II in 1896 and was last in imperial period at the State Opening of the Duma in 1906. \n\nThere was also a Lesser Imperial Crown, very similar in style and workmanship to the Great Imperial Crown, only smaller and entirely set with diamonds, made for Empress Maria Feodorovna, the consort of Paul I, that was used for the coronation of the Tsarina. At the coronation of Nicholas II in 1896, the smaller crown was worn by Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, as was her right as a crowned Empress. A second identical lesser Imperial Crown was made for the young Empress Alexandra Feodorovna to wear. Dowager Empresses outranked reigning Empress Consorts at the Russian Court.\n\nIn 1900, the workshop of Peter Carl Fabergé in St. Petersburg made a replica in miniature of the Imperial Regalia (the Great Imperial Crown, the Lesser Imperial Crown, the Imperial Orb and Sceptre) out of silver, gold, diamonds, sapphires, and rubies, the whole set on a marble pedestal. The work is now in the collection of the Hermitage Museum.\n\nFollowing the tradition of the Byzantine Emperors, the Tsar of Russia placed the crown upon his own head. This left no doubt that, in the Russian system, the imperial power came directly from God. The prayer of the Metropolitan, similar to that of the Patriarch of Constantinople for the Byzantine Emperor, confirmed the imperial supremacy.\n\nA few days prior to the crowning service itself, the Tsar made a processional entry into Moscow, where coronations were always held (even when the capital was in St. Petersburg). Following this, the Imperial regalia were brought from the Kremlin armory into the Tsar's Kremlin palace, where they would accompany the new emperor on his procession to the Dormition Cathedral on the morning of his coronation. This procession commenced at the Red Porch and ended at the church doors, where the presiding prelate and other bishops blessed the Tsar and his consort with holy water and offered them the Holy Cross to kiss.\n\nAfter the Tsar entered the cathedral, he and his spouse venerated the icons there and took their places on two thrones set up in the center of the cathedral. After the sovereign had recited the Nicene Creed as his profession of faith, and after an invocation of the Holy Ghost and a litany, the emperor assumed the purple chlamys, and the crown was then presented to him. He took it and placed it on his head himself, while the Metropolitan recited:\n\nThe Metropolitan would then make the following short address:\n\nFollowing this, the new Tsar crowned his consort, first briefly with his own crown (by touching it momentarily to her head before putting it back on his own), then with a smaller crown of her own. Further prayers and litanies were read, then the Emperor was anointed just prior to reception of Holy Communion during the Divine Liturgy. He was invited to enter the altar area through the Royal Doors (normally reserved solely to the clergy) and partake of Communion as a priest would. Further prayers and blessings concluded the service, which was followed by a special feast held in the Kremlin's Palace of Facets.\n\nRussia's last coronation was in 1896, for Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra. The last occasion on which the Great Imperial Crown was officially used was the State Opening of the Duma in 1906.\n\nIn 1913, Agathon Fabergé, son of Peter Carl Fabergé of the House of Fabergé, the crown jewellers, recommended that the Imperial regalia be re-catalogued and overhauled. The tsar gave his approval and by July 1914, work on the Imperial orb and sceptre had been completed, and work was about to commence on the crowns. Rising tensions and the outbreak of the First World War put a stop to further work, and the regalia items were loaded into nine strong-boxes and sent from Saint Petersburg to Moscow for safekeeping. They were stored in the Kremlin Armoury. The crown remained there with the rest of the regalia during and after the February and October Revolutions in 1917. \n\nIn 1922, they were re-catalogued and transferred to the State Treasury. The crown and other pieces of jewellery and regalia were collected into the State Depository of Treasures, later the Diamond Fund, and discussions were carried out with French and British experts as to the possibility of selling off some of the crown jewels to raise foreign currency. The experts advised against selling such pieces as the crown, orb and sceptre, arguing that they were unlikely to attract their historic worth. Nevertheless, the crown jewels were exhibited in 1922 for two journalists of the \"New York Times\", who later wrote: 'Here', says Begasheff [head of the jewellery commission], opening the box with hands that tremble ever so little despite his air of unconcern, 'is the crown of the Emperor, 32,800 carats of diamonds.'\n\n'Is it heavy?'\n\n'No', said one of the workmen, '5 pounds at most - try it,' and placed it straight away on my head.\n\nThe Imperial Crown appeared on the National emblems of the Russian Empire—the Great Coat of arms (Большой государственный герб Российской Империи), the Medium Coat of Arms (Средний государственный герб Российской Империи), and the Lesser Coat of Arms (Малый государственный герб Российской Империи) of Imperial Russia.\n\nThe Great Imperial Crown was placed above the Imperial Cypher (monogram)—but only after the coronation. After ascending the throne, but before the coronation, the Imperial Cypher would bear the princely crown, but not the Imperial Crown.\n\nThe crown was also placed on the arms of Congress Poland, a puppet state ruled by the Russian Empire (1814–1915), and the Privislinsky Krai which was incorporated into the empire in 1831.\n\nSince December 20, 2000, the Imperial Crown has appeared on the coat of arms of the Russian Federation.\n\n\n"}

Opened in 1974, the complex is home to an arena, auditorium, banquet hall and meeting rooms.\n\n\nIn July 1968, the Asheville City Council approved a civic center plan which would add an exhibition center, meeting space and an arena to Thomas Wolfe Auditorium. As downtown was declining due to suburban development and malls, the complex would be a way to help downtown make a comeback. The arena was the first venue of its type in the city. \n\nIt was home to the Asheville Altitude basketball team in the NBDL, before the franchise moved to Tulsa in 2005 and the United Hockey League's Asheville Smoke and also the SPHL's Asheville Aces.\n\nThe venue also hosted WCW SuperBrawl III, \"WCW Monday Nitro\" where the famed nWo wreaked havoc over the Ric Flair-led Four Horsemen and Fall Brawl (1995) as well as the 1999 and 2000 Big South Conference men's basketball tournament and 1984–1995 Southern Conference men's basketball tournament. The age and the condition of the facility helped lead to the Southern Conference's departure.\n\nCommencement exercises for the University of North Carolina at Asheville were last held in the venue in 1999.\n\nWith the Civic Center losing money, improvements took place starting in 2010.\n\nThe City of Asheville and State of North Carolina have been pressured by many in the community to replace or renovate the aging Civic Center with more modern facilities. This debate has been going on for years, with no apparent end. City Council passed a measure funding basic maintenance and has earmarked $1.5 million for the implementation of a \"living roof\" to replace the aging conventional roof. The ultimate path for the Civic Center was unclear. A complete renovation was still an option. The most popular proposals from the community were to tear down and rebuild in the same location, or to rebuild in an area south of city hall, at the Biltmore Square Mall site, or near the Western North Carolina Agriculture Center.\n\nOn November 22, 2011, Asheville City Council voted to name the facility for U.S. Cellular, provided no other companies made a higher bid by December 31. The name change was effective January 1, 2012. U.S. Cellular will pay $810,000 or more over five years and up to $1.35 million over eight years. The money will help with $5.5 million in renovations.\n\nOn May 29, 2019, Asheville City Council approved a bid from Harrah's Cherokee. The five-year $3.25 million deal takes effect in 2020.\n\nThe arena played host to the politically motivated Vote for Change on October 6, 2004, featuring performances by Gob Roberts, Death Cab for Cutie and Pearl Jam.\n\nPerforming acts in 2013 and beyond includes Southern Conference, Curious George, Ringling Bros., The Color Purple, Bill Cosby, Sesame Street Live, Mannheim Steamroller, Charlotte Bobcats, Atlanta Hawks, Elton John, Elvis Presley, Jeff Dunham, Marty Stewart, Harlem Globetrotters, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, The National (band), WWE, TNA Impact Wrestling, Gordon Lightfoot, Foster the People, Celtic Woman, Casting Crowns, Toby Keith, Sugarland, Bob Dylan, Jerry Seinfeld, Yo Gabba Gabba, The family Stone, Brit Floyd, Band of Horses, Lee \"Shot\" Williams, Queens of the Stone Age, Moscow Ballet, Darius Rucker, Umphrey's McGee, Ohio Players, Disney Junior LIVE, Hunter Hayes, Slayer.\n\nThe Southern Conference brought the 2012, 2013, and 2014 basketball tournaments to the arena. In anticipation of the tournament, the city pledged a $3.2 million renovation of the facility. In February 2018 the arena hosted a Fed Cup tennis tie between the United States and the Netherlands, featuring Serena Williams and Venus Williams.\n\nOn August 13, 2014, a major motion picture named \"Masterminds\" was filmed outside and inside at the arena standing in as a Mexico airport with palm trees everywhere.\n\nU.S. Cellular, a wireless telephone company, has sponsored several sports venues:\n\nU.S. Cellular serves as the title sponsor of a NASCAR Xfinity Series race, the U.S. Cellular 250, at Iowa Speedway in Newton, Iowa.

From 2002 to 2011, he was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, initially representing the Christian Democratic Party until March 2009, and from November 2009 to 2011 was the Family First Party's lone parliamentary representative in New South Wales.\n\nMoyes was born in Melbourne, Victoria, on 17 November 1938. His book \"When Box Hill was a Village\" recalls events from his childhood and youth. \n\nHe first gained prominence in Australia as host of the weekly television program \"Turn 'Round Australia\" and radio program \"Sunday Night Live with Gordon Moyes\".\n\nPrior to becoming superintendent of the Sydney Wesley Mission in 1979, he was an ordained Churches of Christ in Australia minister, serving at Victorian churches in Ascot/Newmarket, Ararat and Cheltenham, while graduating from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts in 1961. He became a minister of the Uniting Church minister following his transfer to the Wesley Mission. In December 2005 he resigned after 27 years from his position at Wesley Mission, handing over to Keith Garner.\n\nMoyes was appointed by the Christian Democratic Party (CDP) to take Elaine Nile's place in the New South Wales Legislative Council in 2002 following her resignation. Moyes subsequently stood for the CDP at the 2003 state election and was elected in his own right.\n\nIn 2004, Moyes started questioning CDP leader Fred Nile's leadership after Nile's return to state politics following his unsuccessful attempt to win a seat at the 2004 federal election. Despite his previous support for Nile, Moyes argued that Nile's anti-homosexual, anti-abortion and anti-Muslim focus should be altered and that greater emphasis be placed on environmental issues. Tensions between the two men escalated following the 2007 election, when Nile was re-elected to the Legislative Council.\n\nIn 2007, the president of the Legislative Council, Meredith Anne Burgmann, retired from public service and the council sought a replacement. Tensions flared when both Moyes and Nile applied for the position. Nile subsequently withdrew his application and nominated Moyes at Moyes' behest. Peter Primrose was confirmed as president on 8 March 2007, Moyes having received only two votes, Nile's and his own. After Nile was made Assistant Deputy President on 28 June 2007 and then Assistant President 28 November 2007, Moyes began to publicly attack Nile.\n\nIn December 2007, Moyes said that Nile was going against his own party executive to oppose Islamic schools, saying that it was policy \"made on the run\" by Nile and was \"certainly not democratic in its methodology or Christian in its theological application\". He called for Nile to be replaced as party leader. In September 2008, Moyes said that Nile was too old to be a viable leader, accusing him of being \"a pathetic figure\" who was a \"loner\" with \"no peers or friends\". He also requested that his parliamentary office be moved, saying that his staff had been subjected to bullying and harassment.\n\nIn February 2009, Nile wrote in his monthly newsletter that he regretted allowing Moyes to take his wife's place upon her retirement \"because of his disloyalty and divisive actions and his frequent support of the Greens\". Moyes stated that the \"Greens\" were \"far more Christian\". In March 2009, the members of the Christian Democratic Party voted to expel Moyes. Moyes responded by stating that the Party was \"hypocritical\", \"anti-democratic\" and exhibited \"extreme fundamentalism\". Moyes chastised party members for their literal interpretation of the Judeo-Christian Bible and made a point telling the \"Sydney Star Observer\" that the CDP stance against homosexuality was un-Christian.\n\nMoyes continued in parliament as an independent before joining the Family First Party in November 2009. On 26 March 2011, Moyes failed in his attempt to be re-elected to the Legislative Council at the 2011 New South Wales election.\n\nAwarded a number of honorary degrees, Moyes was awarded a Doctor of Divinity (\"honoris causa\") from the California Graduate School of Theology in 1985, a Doctor of Laws (\"honoris causa\") also from the California Graduate School of Theology in 1989 and a Doctor of Letters (\"honoris causa\") from Milligan College, Tennessee, also in 1989.\n\nMoyes was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2002 for service to the community in the delivery and expansion of social welfare and outreach services through the Wesley Mission, for fostering networks and partnership arrangements with other agencies to make services more widely available, and to religion. He has also received the honours of Member of the Order of Australia (1986), was appointed a Paul Harris Fellow in 1978 by Rotary International, and received the 1986 Australian Father of the Year award. In 1994, Rotary International recognised Moyes with the president's \"distinguished service\" award.\n\nMoyes lived in Tumbi Umbi on the New South Wales Central Coast. He died on 5 April 2015 in Sydney.\n"}
