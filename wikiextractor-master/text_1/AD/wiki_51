The song was composed and produced by band members Duke Erikson, Shirley Manson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig. \"Stupid Girl\" features lyrics about a young woman's ambivalence and is a musical arrangement centered on a repetitive bassline and a drum sample from the Clash's 1980 hit \"Train in Vain\".\n\nThe song was released by Almo Sounds in North America, and Mushroom Records worldwide, as the band's fourth international single in 1996. \"Stupid Girl\" became the band's biggest hit in United States and the United Kingdom, with its performance on the charts driven by an innovative music video and remixes that gained massive airplay across the world. The success of \"Stupid Girl\" propelled sales of its parent album \"Garbage\" into the top 20 of the \"Billboard\" 200 and into the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart.\n\nReviews of the song were positive, with praise for the production. \"Stupid Girl\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group, as well as the Danish Grammy for Best Rock Song, an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist and an MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song.\n\n\"Stupid Girl\" began as a rough demo around January 1994. It was recorded during informal studio sessions with Duke Erikson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig in Marker's home basement recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin, prior to Shirley Manson joining the group. The band had been jamming using an ADAT eight-track, AKAI samplers and a small drum kit. Vig took a loop from the drum introduction to the Clash's \"Train in Vain\" and added further percussion. Later, Marker was asked to create a bassline like that of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Suzie Q\", \"something that's almost like a Motown feel.\" Erikson finished what became the song's core with a jangly guitar riff. \n\nAfter Marker saw Manson's group Angelfish on \"120 Minutes\", the band invited her to Vig and Marker's Smart Studios to sing on a couple of songs, but after a \"dreadful\" first audition, she returned to Angelfish. Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second attempt, when she began to work on the basic forms of \"Queer\", \"Vow\" and \"Stupid Girl\".\n\nManson's lyrics for \"Stupid Girl\" became an \"anthem for a girl who won't settle for less than what she wants.\" Later she added, \"[\"Stupid Girl\" is] really about squandering potential, [it's] our version of Madonna's 'Express Yourself', but a little more subversive.\" Manson intended the song as a rebuke toward a friend's foolish behavior: \"A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make the most of your potential.\" Manson added that \"Stupid Girl\" was \"a song of reproach to a lot of people we know\", both male and female, and that \"we could have called it 'Stupid Guy,' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious.\"\n\nGarbage wanted to write a song that incorporated a thumping, repetitive bass line to act as a hook. Continuing to develop the demo throughout the recording process for what would eventually become the band's debut album, the group decided to add textures, guitars and keys to make \"Stupid Girl\" dynamic rather than the product of complicated chord changes. Marker and Vig then added in elements of ambient sound effects throughout the audio mix, including the \"glitchy\" sound of a broken DAT player used during the pre-chorus. Marker had been dubbing between audio tracks, resulting in scratchy feedback; he sampled the sound and tuned it to fit the song, unintentionally created by an alternative hook. When Manson recorded her first vocals for \"Stupid Girl\", the band realized that the song's key was too low, but instead of re-recording the guitars, Vig re-printed them through a pitch-change patch on an effects unit. Erikson commented that the effects are \"just ear candy, but they contribute to the character of the song, make the listener think in a certain way about the song.\" Additional percussion on \"Stupid Girl\" was performed by Madison musician Pauli Ryan, while the bass guitar line was played on the record by Milwaukee session bassist Mike Kashou, both of whom performed on several other tracks on the album.\n\nReflecting on the success of the song in 2002, Vig admitted: \"People still ask us who the 'Stupid Girl' is, and that's impossible to answer. The song is sort of meant to be a wake up call. It could be about an ex-girlfriend. It could be about a rock diva that we all know, it could be about your sister. It could also be called 'Stupid Boy'.\" Looking back, he also stated, \"It's impossible to predict what will be a hit. But subconsciously, I knew the song was good when I kept playing the same rough mix over and over again on my car stereo for months.\"\n\n\"Stupid Girl\" is a moderately fast alternative rock song with touches of electronica, set in common time. It is built on a I-IV change in F, with both chords, F7 and B7.\n\nThe tonal function of a dominant seventh chord is to resolve up a perfect fourth. In non-classical harmony, the chord is often used similarly, but especially in blues, funk, and early rock music, it is also commonly used for its color, which seems to mesh major and minor together with its major third, minor seventh and the dissonant interval between the two. When the F7 chord is played, it should traditionally resolve to a B major 7th chord, the M7 being the major 3rd of the tonic.\n\nInstead, on the B note is another dominant seventh. Such chords are the basis of the twelve-bar blues, and are used in this way to give \"Stupid Girl\" a bluesy, rock-'n'-roll feel. The chord change is manipulated to emphasize the B's flatted seventh (a minor third from the tonic), giving the song a sulky mood. This chord change is used for the intro, verse, chorus and the instrumental sections, except for the pre-chorus, which is in the relative key of D minor. Regardless of the chord progression, the song seems to fall somewhere between major and minor, and the use of four-note seventh chords (as opposed to \"three-note\" chords) help to form a rich atmosphere. \"Stupid Girl\" is mainly carried by this arrangement, along with the drum beats sampled from \"Train in Vain\".\n\nIn the intro, four bars set the rhythm, adorned by only a guitar pick-slide and audio effects. The verse adds Manson's vocals and a bass riff that uses flattened blue notes to give \"Stupid Girl\" an funky, unsettled feel. The eight-bar pre-chorus abruptly cuts in with minor chords, and sampled feedback replaces the bass, which drops out. This, coupled with Manson singing high in her range, creates tension and enables the presence of the bass to be felt when it re-enters on the chorus. The guitar figures in the bridge include a phrase played low and rhythmic guitar stabs on the opposite side of the audio mix. In the chorus, Manson's main vocal is answered by an \"aah-ah\" of voice and guitar together. The word \"girl\" lands on a flattened bass note (A against the F note, instead of A).\n\nThe first single release of \"Stupid Girl\" occurred in Australia and New Zealand on January 22, 1996, when the White label issued both CD and cassette versions backed with \"Trip My Wire\" (previously released on the \"Queer\" single in the UK) and remixes of \"Queer\" by Adrian Sherwood and Martin Gore. A week later, White issued a second CD featuring a cover version of the Jam's \"Butterfly Collector\" and a further two \"Queer\" mixes produced by Danny Saber and Rabbit in the Moon (also previously released in the UK). In July, White released a limited-edition EP titled \"Stupid Girl (The Remixes)\" collecting the UK B-sides and remixes for the Australian market. BMG released \"Stupid Girl\" across Europe on February 28. The single was issued as a CD maxi backed with both \"Butterfly Collector\" and \"Trip My Wire\". When Garbage returned to tour Europe's rock festivals in August, BMG reissued \"Stupid Girl\" in France and Germany.\n\nMushroom Records sent \"Stupid Girl\" to radio stations in the UK a month in advance of its release, and it was A-listed at Radio One, Virgin and Capital. Mushroom issued \"Stupid Girl\" on March 11 as a 2×CD single set and limited-edition 7\" vinyl packaged in two differing colors of fabric. The song was backed with \"Driving Lesson\", a new version of \"Dog New Tricks\" and a remix of \"Stupid Girl\" produced by Red Snapper on the first disc, with \"Alien Sex Fiend\" and two versions of \"Stupid Girl\" remixed by Dreadzone on the second. The vinyl was backed with the mix of \"Dog New Tricks\". The single was supported by Garbage's first-ever UK tour, which launched on March 19. In the midst of the tour, Garbage performed the single on \"Top of the Pops\" and a live showcase performance of \"Stupid Girl\" and \"Only Happy When It Rains\" on \"TFI Friday\".\n\nIn North America, where \"Only Happy When It Rains\" had been the band's breakthrough single, Almo Sounds planned either \"Stupid Girl\" or a re-release of Garbage's debut single \"Vow\" to follow it up. On May 25, Almo sent \"Stupid Girl\" to alternative radio, while Garbage joined the Smashing Pumpkins' North American arena tour as the opening act through June and July. The tour was halted after Smashing Pumpkins keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin fatally overdosed, and the Smashing Pumpkins resumed without Garbage a month later. Almo reissued \"Stupid Girl\", with a remix produced by Todd Terry, to Top 40 radio. On July 9, Almo released \"Stupid Girl\" to record stores on CD and cassette single, backed with \"Driving Lesson\" and the Todd Terry version. Almo provided remixes of the song to clubs. On July 11, Garbage performed \"Stupid Girl\" on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", and in October performed the song at the VH1 Fashion Awards, which earned attention because of Manson's wardrobe malfunction. On August 6, Almo issued a 12\" vinyl release featuring \"Driving Lesson\" and remixes of \"Stupid Girl\" produced by Todd Terry, Danny Saber, Rabbit in the Moon and Jason Bentley.\n\n\"Stupid Girl\" first charted on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart in the week ending February 4, 1996, debuting at number 99 and peaking at number 47 on March 24, 1996. The single charted for two non-consecutive weeks on the New Zealand Top 40, peaking at number 32 in February. In Iceland, \"Stupid Girl\" debuted at number 18 at the start of April, and shot up to number 4 in the second week, where it remained for three weeks. In Spain, \"Stupid Girl\" peaked at number 40 on the airplay chart. In Ireland, \"Stupid Girl\" peaked at number 16. In France, \"Stupid Girl\" peaked at number 38 on the singles chart, and \"Garbage\" re-charted to peak at number 16 on the album chart.\n\nAt the start of March, \"Stupid Girl\" debuted at number 48 on the UK airplay chart, and the band's debut album re-entered the album chart at number 27. Later, \"Stupid Girl\" debuted as the highest new entry on the UK Singles Chart at number 4, the highest position attained by any Garbage single. In its second week, \"Stupid Girl\" dropped to 10th as \"Garbage\" broke into the top ten albums list for the first time. On the airplay chart, \"Stupid Girl\" peaked at number 5 and spent the entire following month within the top ten. \"Stupid Girl\" spend seven weeks in the top 75 and sold 120,000 copies.\n\nIn North America, after a week on air in April, \"Stupid Girl\" debuted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 38. Two weeks later, it broke into the Modern Rock top 20 with an \"Airpower\" rating, meaning the song had registered over 900 plays for the first time on alternative radio. The song debuted at number 66 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. At the end of the month, \"Stupid Girl\" reached the top ten on the Modern Rock chart, peaking at number 2 in August, and not leaving the top ten until September as \"Garbage\" ascended into the top 40 of the \"Billboard\" 200 for the first time. The remixes were listed on the Hot Dance Break-Outs list as \"Stupid Girl\" debuted at 46th on the Hot 100.\n\nBy August, \"Stupid Girl\" continued to chart, debuting at number 68 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, at number 47 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart and at number 46 on the Hot Dance/Club Play chart. The success propelled the album \"Garbage\" to as high as number 20 on the \"Billboard\" 200, doubling its sales to around 40,000 units each week and allowing it to attain platinum certification by the RIAA for shipping one million units. The remix album peaked at number 30 on the Maxi-Singles Sales chart. In mid-August, \"Stupid Girl\" peaked at number 26 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and picked up enough mainstream rock airplay to spend two weeks at number 39 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. At the start of September, \"Stupid Girl\" became a crossover hit on both alternate and contemporary hit radio, and it reached number 25 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart. Two weeks later, the song earned Garbage's highest position on the Hot 100 when it reached number 24. It also peaked at number 33 on the Single Sales chart and at number 5 on the Club Play chart. \"Stupid Girl\" continued to gain a larger crossover audience throughout October, debuting on the Adult Top 40. The song left the Modern Rock chart in mid-November after 25 weeks and remained on the Hot 100 for 20 weeks until the start of December.\n\nIn 1996, Mushroom released a white label to clubs featuring the Red Snapper and Dreadzone mixes in advance of the UK release of \"Stupid Girl\". The Red Snapper mix was later released in Europe on the B-side to \"Only Happy When It Rains\", while White Records released this mix along with the Dreadzone mixes on the \"Stupid Girl (The Remixes)\" extended play. Almo Sounds commissioned additional remixes from Danny Saber, Rabbit in the Moon, Jason Bentley and Todd Terry for the North American release of the single. One of Todd Terry's mixes was also provided to Top 40 radio. Mushroom later released this version, along with the Danny Saber mix in the UK on the B-side of \"Milk\", while White included the Todd Terry mix on the bonus disc of the \"Garbage: Australian Tour Edition\". In 1997, Mushroom released four Todd Terry mixes on a set of 12\" vinyls (\"Stupid Girl Remixes\") in the UK. An instrumental version of the Red Snapper mix was also included on the compilation album \"Big Beat Elite\". In 2007, Todd Terry's radio mix was remastered and included on the \"Absolute Garbage\" bonus disc \"Garbage Mixes\".\n\nDanny Saber's remix brief for his version of \"Stupid Girl\" sought to create a version of the song for radio airplay on new wave/alternative rock stations. Garbage's management wanted Saber to retain the original's \"Train in Vain\" loop, as it had cost the band a significant amount to license. Saber opted for a Soft Cell/house music combination; incorporating the original vocal line, tempo, key and feedback. Saber created a new bassline for the remix, arranging the mix around it. Saber completed the remix in a single day, with one further day required to mix.\n\nGarbage recorded a number of tracks for the B-side of \"Stupid Girl\" in January 1996 during rehearsals for their first full-length concert tour. During the rehearsals, Garbage remixed their album track \"Dog New Tricks\", wrote and recorded \"Driving Lesson\" and \"Alien Sex Fiend\". The band also recorded the Vic Chesnutt song \"Kick My Ass\" for inclusion on the charity album \"\". Daniel Shulman plays bass on all four tracks. On October 14, 1998, Garbage, Electronic Arts, AT&T and Broadcast.com linked up to promote a live webcast from Garbage's headline show at Dallas Bronco Bowl by offering a free .a2b file format digital download of \"Driving Lesson\", which registered over 6,000 downloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe music video for \"Stupid Girl\" was filmed on January 16, 1996 in a Los Angeles warehouse by director Samuel Bayer. The four-hour shoot took place after filming the \"Only Happy When It Rains\" music video. The \"Stupid Girl\" video was given a smaller budget, as Almo Sounds believed that \"Only Happy When It Rains\" would be a bigger hit than \"Stupid Girl\". According to Manson, the other band members were drunk and exhausted after three days shooting the first video.\n\nThe \"Stupid Girl\" video debuted internationally on February 1, 1996, and in North America on May 5. MTV added the video the week of May 13 and certified \"Stupid Girl\" a Buzz Clip. It was the band's third consecutive video to be guaranteed heavy airplay on the network. VH1 added the video at the start of September and featured it in a \"Pop-Up Video\" episode.\n\nThe video for \"Stupid Girl\" is a performance piece inspired by the title sequence from David Fincher's 1995 movie \"Se7en\". The clip was shot in a warehouse decorated with plexiglas sheets upon which the song's lyrics were written. Bayer cut the film into pieces and soaked it in his bath, applying deliberate fingerprints and abrasions to the footage before putting it back together by hand. \"Film is generally treated like this pristine canvas,\" Bayer later explained, \"If it's scratched, it's considered ruined. I wanted to add to the excitement of \"Stupid Girl\" with a really organic video, something that had a handmade quality.\" To accomplish this, Bayer showed some of the filmmaking process itself; Manson is shown behind a clapperboard and reels visibly spool past the frame, while penned marks, sprocket holes, spots and reference numbers are seen. At one point, the frame lurches, as if to suggest that the camera operator has lost control of the camera. Bayer's colorist made use of sepia, blues, greens and reds to suggest that each frame was individually hand-tinted. Vig would compliment the video for mirroring the band's sound: \"some of it looked beautiful, some of it looked distorted, and kinda fucked up - and it sorta described some of our music visually.\" Bayer later re-edited a second version of the video, with alternative footage from the original shoot, for a remix version of \"Stupid Girl\" by Todd Terry. Bayer would later shoot Green Day's 2004 \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" video in a similar manner.\n\nThe \"Stupid Girl\" video was nominated in the Best New Artist in a Video category at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, losing to the Stéphane Sednaoui-directed video for Alanis Morissette's \"Ironic\".\n\nThe \"Stupid Girl\" video was first commercially released on VHS and Video-CD on 1996's \"Garbage Video\", along with \"making-of\" outtake footage. A remastered version was later included on Garbage's 2007 greatest-hits DVD \"Absolute Garbage\", and was made available as a digital download via online music services the same year. The \"Stupid Girl\" video was uploaded to YouTube and Vevo in 2013.\n\n\"Stupid Girl\" received an overwhelmingly positive response from music critics both upon the release of \"Garbage\" and upon its single release. \"Select\"s Ian Harrison called the song \"Duran-like\", describing it as \"mighty doomy pop neatly tailored to enhance one's natural discontentment.\" \"Vox\" magazine's Craig McLean called it \"malignant, dirty, devious, sneering pop\", while \"Metal Hammer\"'s Pippa Lang compared Manson's \"ever-so-sexy, sibilant\" vocals to Trent Reznor's. \"Kerrang!\" described \"Stupid Girl\" as \"a classy piece of predatory pop perfection that wields an iron punch beneath velvet glove.\"\n\nThe song was nominated for two Grammy Awards, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group, but lost to Tracy Chapman's \"Give Me One Reason\" and Dave Matthews Band's \"So Much to Say\", respectively. \"Stupid Girl\" was also nominated for a Danish Grammy for Best Rock Song, and for the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song. In 1997, Broadcast Music Incorporated awarded \"Stupid Girl\" a Citation of Achievement for Best Pop Song, meaning it was among the year's most-performed songs. Erikson said the song was \"a crowd favorite\" that improves the set list's mood whenever it gets played, and Vig added that \"we've played 'Stupid Girl' on stage more than a thousand times and I'm still not sick of it.\"\n\nIn 2005, \"Stupid Girl\" was featured in Curtis Hanson's film \"In Her Shoes\", while later that year, Alexz Johnson recorded a cover version of the track for the soundtrack album \"Songs from Instant Star\". In 2011, it was nominated for the final track listing on STV's \"Scotland's Greatest Album\".\n\n \n\nYear-end charts\n\n"}

{"id": "2252480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252480", "title": "Guy Sigsworth", "text": "Guy Sigsworth\n\nGuy Sigsworth is a British composer, producer and songwriter. During his career he has worked with many artists, including Seal, Björk, Goldie, Madonna, Britney Spears, Kate Havnevik, Imogen Heap, Bebel Gilberto, Mozez, David Sylvian, Alanis Morissette, Eric Whitacre, Alison Moyet and AURORA . He has also collaborated with many celebrated instrumental musicians, including Talvin Singh, Jon Hassell and Lester Bowie. He was previously a member of the band Frou Frou together with Imogen Heap.\n\nSigsworth grew up in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, where he developed a youthful passion for early music, especially the 14th-century composer Guillaume de Machaut. His earliest musical heroes were the multi-instrumentalist David Munrow and the maverick field-recordist and composer David Fanshawe. He was a pupil at Leeds Grammar School in the 1970s, where he and his band performed a memorable version of Red House which ended prematurely after he cut his hand rather badly on a cymbal. He studied the harpsichord, first at summer schools at the Casa de Mateus in Portugal, and later for a year at the Utrechts Conservatorium in the Netherlands. He toured Europe playing harpsichord for the European Union Baroque Orchestra.\n\nSigsworth has worked with various engineers and programmers of distinction. During the late 1990s he worked with Damian Taylor, who has since engineered, programmed and performed live with Björk; in the early 2000s he worked with Sean McGhee who has since produced Temposhark; and most recently he has worked extensively with Andy Page, who has previously worked with Sasha, BT and Harry Gregson-Williams.\n\nReturning to the UK he moved to London and made a sudden change of direction. He became fascinated with the burgeoning Acid House sound, and immediately bought a Roland sampler and an Atari computer. He met Seal, co-writing four songs on Seal's debut album: \"Crazy\", \"The Beginning\", \"Wild\" and \"Violet\", plus the B-side, \"Sparkle\". The album's producer, Trevor Horn, was the first pop record producer Sigsworth had ever met.\n\nTim Simenon was also involved in work on Seal's song \"Crazy\", and Sigsworth soon became part of the regular production team of Simenon's band, Bomb The Bass, co-writing the UK No. 7 hit single \"Winter in July\". He also worked with Simenon on Hector Zazou's 1992 album Sahara Blue, performing alongside the celebrated French actor Gérard Depardieu on the track, \"I'll Strangle You\". Sigsworth subsequently contributed to Zazou's 1994 album Songs From The Cold Seas accompanying Björk.\n\nWhile working on sessions for Japanese drummer/producer Gota Yashiki, Sigsworth met the virtuoso tabla player Talvin Singh. He subsequently played synthesizer and harpsichord for Singh's live shows, and later played and contributed remixes on Singh's debut album, OK.\n\nGuy Sigsworth produced early 1993 the benefit Song „Survival Game\" for the relief organization \"Menschen für Menschen\" in Ethiopia, founded by the actor Karlheinz Böhm. The song was written by Mike Turtle and Dean Frederick. The Single Survival Game was 1995 worldwide released by BMG Ariola / Coconut Records. The remixes made by Paul Dakeyne hit the Charts in South America and Europe. The It’s 5 to 12 / Survival Game project was originally initiated by the Swiss Media Manager Ditti Brook.\n\nIt was through Singh that Sigsworth met Björk, becoming keyboard player, and later music director, of her live band for two albums. Sigsworth brought his early music sensibility to Björk's live performances and recordings, adding harpsichord, clavichord, regal and positive organ accompaniments to her music. Sigsworth's harpsichord can be heard on the song \"Cover Me\" from Post; clavichord on the song \"All Is Full of Love\"; and organ on the song \"Unravel\" from Homogenic. \"Unravel\" was Sigsworth's first co-written song with Björk. Sigsworth also played celesta on Björk's cover of Joni Mitchell's \"The Boho Dance\"; the celesta later became a feature on both Dancer in the Dark (where he also contributed a string arrangement) and Vespertine, on which he co-wrote \"Hidden Place\", \"An Echo, A Stain\", \"Sun in My Mouth\" and \"Harm of Will\".\n\nSigsworth first met Imogen Heap in 1996 after a friend played him a demo of her song \"Come Here Boy\". He immediately fell in love with her distinctive voice. He was also amazed to hear that she shared his idiosyncratic love of melodies featuring wide, angular intervals - especially major 7ths and minor 9ths - which are not so common in pop. They wrote two songs together, \"Getting Scared\" and \"Airplane\", which Sigsworth produced for her debut album, I Megaphone. In return, Heap sang backing vocals on Sigsworth's band project with Alexander Nilere, Acacia.\n\nIn 1999 Sigsworth scored the movie , which included musical contributions from Imogen Heap, Talvin Singh, and free jazz virtuoso Lester Bowie.\n\nSigsworth co-produced the 1998 Mandalay album Empathy, which attracted the attention of Madonna. This in turn led to him co-writing the song \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" with Madonna, for her 2000 album \"Music\". Sigsworth also wrote the song \"Nothing Fails\" with Jem for Madonna's 2003 album \"American Life\".\n\nOne night in Mumbai, India, where he was producing a song for UK Asian artist Amar, Sigsworth composed a tune on his Yamaha QY20 pocket sequencer. As soon as he arrived back in London, he took it to Imogen Heap, and asked her to write a top line for it. It became \"Flicks\", their first song for what would become the Frou Frou album \"Details\". Originally, there was no plan for Sigsworth and Heap to form a \"proper\" band. It was simply a matter of Sigsworth wanting to hear various song ideas properly realized. As Heap says: \"Every month or so Guy would phone me up and say 'I've got a new song, would you come in and sing it?' and then before we knew it we'd already started the album.\"\n\nAs a linking concept for the emerging set of songs, Sigsworth suggested two ideas for the lyrics:\n\nSigsworth wrote the lyrics to the songs \"Breathe In\", \"Only Got One\" and \"The Dumbing Down of Love\", and co-wrote the lyrics to \"Let Go\", \"It's Good To Be in Love\", and \"Psychobabble\" on Details. Heap wrote the remaining lyrics, apart from \"Maddening Shroud\", which has lyrics by Alexander Nilere.\n\nAfter eleven songs had been completed, Heap and Sigsworth set about finding a name for their collaborative effort. Sigsworth, a fan of all things French, came up with \"Frou Frou\", which Heap loved. The name comes from Rimbaud's 1870 poem \"Ma Bohème\", and is a French onomatopoeic word originally meaning the swishing noise made by skirts on dancing women. The album title, \"Details\", was a reference to the way the songs were constructed in the studio, by layering momentary details of sounds and performances to create a web of sound.\n\nThe album was released in 2002 on Universal Records. It was critically acclaimed, but did not achieve mass sales. \"Breathe In\" was released as the first single internationally, and reached number two on the Italian radio airplay charts, but follow up singles, \"Must Be Dreaming\" and \"It's Good To Be in Love\" were never commercially released in the UK. A video was also made for \"The Dumbing Down of Love\", directed by Joel Peissig (who later directed Heap's solo video, \"Hide and Seek\"). After touring the record extensively across the United States, where the duo had established a cult fan base, Frou Frou disbanded in 2003.\n\nHeap and Sigsworth temporarily reformed Frou Frou to record a cover version of \"Holding Out for a Hero\", originally recorded by Bonnie Tyler, for the Shrek 2 soundtrack. The duo were approached by the music director of the film, who had been a fan of their album. The resulting track is played during the end credits of the film. Frou Frou also experienced a resurgence in popularity in 2004, when Scrubs star, Zach Braff chose album track \"Let Go\" for his independent film, \"Garden State\". Other Frou Frou tracks have been included on television series, such as \"\" and \"Roswell High\".\n\nDespite disbanding only after one album (Heap and Sigsworth remain firm friends and meet regularly to catch up on things, but are currently focused on separate musical projects), Frou Frou's musical influence has remained widespread and both Heap and Sigsworth have seen an increase in interest in their projects post-collaboration.\n\nSince Frou Frou, Sigsworth has returned to producing and co-writing for other artists.\n\nSigsworth has remixed a song by Hong Kong-based actress and singer-songwriter Chelsia Chan. The songs' lyrics are a Mandarin-language adaptation of a poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\n\nSigsworth has contributed to two albums for Brazilian artist Bebel Gilberto, co-writing and producing the song Cada Beijo, and remixing the song O Caminho for her 2004 album Bebel Gilberto, and producing five songs for her 2007 album Momento.\n\nSigsworth produced the vocals on Josh Groban's single \"You Are Loved\", taken from his 2006 album \"Awake\".\n\nSigsworth has worked extensively with Norwegian singer-songwriter Kate Havnevik. On her first album, Melankton (2006), Sigsworth co-wrote and produced four tracks, including the single, \"Unlike Me\" (which was featured in an a cappella version on the US hit TV show Grey's Anatomy, along with \"Kaleidoscope\"), \"Not Fair\", \"Kaleidoscope\" and \"You Again.\" Another Sigsworth collaboration, entitled \"So:Lo\", was released on iTunes in late 2006, and appeared on the USA version of Melankton in 2007, and was also used in Grey's Anatomy. Sigsworth produced and co-wrote Kate's second album \"YOU\", released in 2012 with songs like \"Halo\", also used in Grey's Anatomy.

While there are Judges of the Court of Claims who handle only claims against the state, there are many Judges of the Court of Claims who are appointed to this post and then assigned to serve as an Acting Justice of the New York State Supreme Court, generally in the criminal term of the court. This is done to increase the number of trial judges in the state for felony crimes, as it can be easier for Legislators to vote to increase the number of Court of Claims judges than Supreme Court Justices in view of differences in the manner of selecting the judges.\n\nClaims against the State of New York were originally heard and decided by the New York State Legislature. In 1874, a constitutional amendment was ratified which prohibited the Legislature to assess claims against the State, and in 1876 the State Board of Audit (later renamed Board of Claims) was created to step in. In 1897, the Board of Claims was abolished and a Court of Claims, consisting of three judges, created instead. On July 31, 1911, the Court of Claims was abolished and the Board of Claims, consisting of three commissioners, was restored.\n\nThe present Court of Claims was re-established on January 28, 1915, to succeed the Board of Claims.\n\n\n"}

He also writes lyrics for other bands, including Zyklon. In 2013, it was announced that Faust would return to Emperor as drummer for the 20th-anniversary tour of \"In the Nightside Eclipse\" in the summer of 2014. He has been the drummer for Blood Tsunami since 2005 and Djevel since 2017.\n\nOn 21 August 1992, while Eithun was visiting family in Lillehammer, he stabbed Magne Andreassen to death. According to Eithun, while walking home from a pub through the Olympic park, a well known gay-cruising spot, Andreassen drunkenly approached him and solicited him for sex. Eithun agreed to go with him to the nearby woods and stabbed Andreassen 37 times. He kicked him in the head repeatedly as he lay on the ground.\n\nEithun claimed that he felt no remorse at the time. Ihsahn, his bandmate in Emperor, said that Eithun \"had been very fascinated by serial killers for a long time, and I guess he wanted to know what it's like to kill a person\". The media has linked the murder to black metal and speculated that Eithun was motivated by Satanism, fascism, or homophobia. In a 1993 interview he had said \"I am not a Satanist, but I praise the evil\". In an interview for the book \"Lords of Chaos\" he explained he had been \"interested in Satanism but there are other things as well. Basically, I don't give a shit\". In a 2008 interview Eithun said: \"I was never a Satanist or fascist in any way\". Jørn Inge Tunsberg of the band Hades Almighty said that the murder was \"an impulse killing\" and that \"it had nothing to do with black metal\".\n\nPolice initially had no suspects, and Eithun remained free for about a year.

{"id": "2252494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252494", "title": "Papiria gens", "text": "Papiria gens\n\nThe gens Papiria was an ancient patrician family at ancient Rome. According to tradition, the Papirii had already achieved prominence in the time of the kings, and the first Rex Sacrorum was a member of this gens. Lucius Papirius Mugillanus was the first of the Papirii to obtain the consulship in 444 BC. The patrician members of the family regularly occupied the highest offices of the Roman state down to the time of the Punic Wars. Most of the Papirii who held office under the later Republic belonged to various plebeian branches of the family. Although the most illustrious Papirii flourished in the time of the Republic, a number of the family continued to hold high office during the first two centuries of the Empire.\n\nCicero described the history of the Papirii to his friend, Papirius Paetus, a plebeian member of the family, who was unaware of the patrician origin of the family. According to Cicero, the Papirii were one of the \"gentes minores\", the lesser of two divisions made amongst the patrician gentes at Rome. The \"gentes maiores\" were the greatest or most noble patrician houses, while the rest of the patrician families made up the \"gentes minores\". The precise distinction between the two divisions is not known, nor have any lists of the families belonging to each survived from antiquity. However, it has been suggested that the \"gentes maiores\" consisted, at least in part, of the families who came to Rome in the time of Romulus, while the \"gentes minores\" consisted of the patrician families that were enrolled after the destruction of Alba Longa, or under the Tarquins.\n\nThe original form of the nomen \"Papirius\" was \"Papisius\", and all of the early Papirii would have been known by this name, although in later times they were always referred to as Papirii. A number of other ancient nomina experienced the same evolution; \"Fusius\" becoming \"Furius\", \"Valesius\" becoming \"Valerius\", and \"Vetusius\" becoming \"Veturius\". Cicero writes that the first of the Papirii to adopt the \"modern\" spelling was Lucius Papirius Crassus, consul in BC 336.\n\nThe chief praenomina of the Papirii during the Republic were \"Lucius, Marcus, Gaius, Manius\", and \"Spurius\". The first three were the most common of all Roman names, while \"Manius\" and \"Spurius\" were much more distinctive. The only other praenomina found among the patrician Papirii are \"Tiberius\", and perhaps \"Sextus\" or \"Publius\", known from individual instances, but only \"Publius\" is known from the other members of the gens. The plebeian Papirii Carbones used primarily \"Gaius\" and \"Gnaeus\"; this last was a common name not found among the ancient patrician stirpes, but which was still used by the Papirii of imperial times.\n\nFrom at least the time of the early Republic, the Papirii are divided into a number of branches, or \"stirpes\", distinguished by their surnames. Cicero lists the patrician cognomina of the Papirii as \"Crassus, Cursor, Maso\", and \"Mugillanus\", while the plebeian families included those of \"Carbo, Paetus\", and \"Turdus\".\n\nThe Papirii Mugillani were the first of these families to obtain the consulship. Their surname was derived from an ancient city of Latium known as \"Mugilla\", the ancestral home of the Papirii. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Mugilla was conquered by Coriolanus after he was banished from Rome and went over to the Volsci. It must have been in the vicinity of the Volscian towns of Pollusca and Corioli, but it was evidently deserted at a very early date, as Pliny does not mention it among his list of former cities in Latium.\n\nThe Papirii Crassi appear almost simultaneously with the Mugillani, and remained a distinct family down to the Second Samnite War. Their surname, \"Crassus\", which means \"thick\" or \"fat\", was common to a number of prominent gentes, including the Claudii and the Licinii.\n\n\"Cursor\", the surname of the third branch of the Papirii to achieve prominence, means \"a runner\", and was probably bestowed upon the ancestor of the family because of his speed. The Papirii Cursores appear in history from the early fourth century BC to the beginning of the third.\n\nThe surname \"Maso\", sometimes spelled \"Masso\", is derived from the Latin \"massa\", a \"mass\" or \"lump\". The Papirii Masones were the last of the distinct patrician families of this gens, although some of the other Papirii were also patricians, including Lucius Papirius Praetextatus, censor in 272 BC. The Masones occur from the end of the fourth century BC down to the time of Cicero.\n\nAmong the plebeian branches of the Papiria gens, the most important was that surnamed \"Carbo\", referring to a piece of coal or charcoal; metaphorically, something black, or of little value. The Papirii Carbones appear in the first half of the second century BC, and continued down to the time of Cicero.\n\n\"Paetus\", the surname of Cicero's plebeian friend, referred to a mild defect of vision, variously described as \"blink-eyed\", or \"squinty\". This common cognomen implied a lesser deficit than \"Strabo\", \"squinty\", \"Luscus\", \"one-eyed\", or \"Caecus\", \"blind\", and could even be regarded as endearing; it was an epithet of Venus.\n\nCicero describes the Papirii Turdi as a plebeian family, although only one of them is mentioned in history: Gaius Papirius Turdus, tribune of the plebs in 177 BC. Their surname signified a thrush.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252503", "title": "New York City Criminal Court", "text": "New York City Criminal Court\n\nThe Criminal Court of the City of New York is a court of the New York State Unified Court System in New York City that handles misdemeanors (generally, crimes punishable by fine or imprisonment of up to one year) and lesser offenses, and also conducts arraignments (initial court appearances following arrest) and preliminary hearings in felony cases (generally, more serious offenses punishable by imprisonment of more than one year).\n\nIt is a single citywide court. The Deputy Chief Administrative Judge for the New York City Courts is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the NYC trial-level courts, and works with the Administrative Judge of the Criminal Court in order to allocate and assign judicial and nonjudicial personnel resources. One hundred and seven judges may be appointed by the Mayor to 10-year terms, but most of those appointed have been transferred to other courts by the Office of Court Administration.\n\nMost people who are arrested and prosecuted in New York City will appear before a Criminal Court judge for arraignment. The New York Criminal Procedure Law (CPL) is the primary criminal procedure law.\n\nFelonies are heard by the Supreme Court. Some violations and other issues are adjudicated by other city and state administrative courts, e.g., Krimstock hearings are conducted by the city Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, parking violations are adjudicated by the city DOF Parking Violations Bureau, and non-parking traffic violations are adjudicated by the state DMV Traffic Violations Bureau.\n\nNew York police officers may arrest someone they have reason to believe has committed a felony, misdemeanor, or violation, or pursuant to an arrest warrant. Those arrested are booked at \"central booking\" and interviewed by a representative of the Criminal Justice Agency for the purposes of recommending bail or remand at arraignment. In New York state, the time from arrest to arraignment must be within 24 hours. Police may also release a person with an \"appearance ticket\" directing a defendant to appear for arraignment in the future: with a desk appearance ticket (DAT) after arrest, or a universal summons without arrest.\n\nAt arraignment, the accused is informed of the charges against them and submits a plea (and may accept a plea bargain). The accused have a right to be represented by (and be provided legal aid by) a lawyer, and one will be appointed for them if they cannot afford one. Arraignments are held every day from 9:00am to 1:00am. At arraignment the prosecutor may also provides defense counsel with certain \"notices\", such as notices about police lineups and statements made by the defendant to police.\n\nAfter notices are served, the prosecutor may ask the court to keep the accused in jail (remanded) or released on bail. Otherwise, the accused is released on their own recognizance (ROR'd). If the accused is released, the accused must appear in court every time their case is calendared (scheduled for a court hearing), and if they fail to appear the judge may forfeit their bail and issue a bench warrant for their arrest, although judges may excuse defendants from having to show up at every court appearance.\n\nThe decision to set bail and the amount of bail to set are discretionary, and the central issue regarding bail is insuring the defendant's future appearances in court; factors to be taken into consideration are defined in . In practice, bail amounts are typically linked to charge severity rather than risk of failure to appear in court, judges overwhelmingly rely only on cash bail and commercial bail bonds instead of other forms of bail, and courts rarely inquire into the defendant's financial resources to understand what amount of bail might be securable by them.\n\nFor those accused of a felony, their case is sent to a court part where felony cases await the action of the grand jury. If the grand jury finds that there is enough evidence that the accused has committed a crime, it may file an indictment. If the accused waives their right to a grand jury, the prosecutor will file a Superior Court Information (SCI). If the grand jury votes an indictment, the case will be transferred from Criminal Court to the Supreme Court for another arraignment. This arraignment is similar to the arraignment in Criminal Court, and if the accused does not submit a guilty plea, the case will be adjourned to a calendar part.\n\nFelony defendants must be released on day if they haven't been indicted, which is to say that unless a grand jury has indicted the defendant and a hearing has commenced within 120 hours/5 days (with an additional 24 hours allowed for weekends and holidays, i.e., 144 hours/6 days), or proof that the indictment was voted within 120 hours, and unless the delay was due to a request of the defendant, and absent a compelling reason for the prosecution's delay, the defendant must be released on their own recognizance (ROR'd).\n\nPlea bargain negotiations take place in the AP Parts prior to the case being in a trial-ready posture, and depending upon caseloads, the judges in the AP Parts may conduct pre-trial and felony motion hearings. The most common pre-trial evidence suppression hearings are \"Mapp\" (warrantless searches and probable cause), \"Dunaway\" (confessions), \"Huntley\" (Miranda rights), \"Wade\" (identification evidence like lineups), and \"Johnson\" (\"Terry\" stops) hearings. Trial Parts also conduct pre-trial motion hearings, including \"Sandoval\" (witness impeachment) and \"Molineux\" (admissibility of prior uncharged crimes) hearings. Once pretrial hearings are completed, the case is considered ready for trial and will usually be transferred to a courtroom that specializes in handling trials.\n\nA bail review in Supreme Court may be requested by misdemeanor defendants who cannot make bail at the day appearance (the five- to six-day deadline for conversion of a complaint to an information), normally to be scheduled three business days later. The government must be ready for trial within 6 months for a felony, 90 days for a class A misdemeanor, 60 days for a class B misdemeanor, and within 30 days for a violation, subject to excluded periods (ready rule). A defendant must be released on bail or ROR'd if they are in jail after a specified time of pretrial detention (bail review): within 90 days for a felony, within 30 days for an at-least-3-months misdemeanor, within 15 days for a maximum-3-months misdemeanor, and within 5 days for a violation, subject to excluded periods.\n\nIn New York State, only those individuals charged with a serious crime, defined as one where the defendant faces more than six months in jail, are entitled to a jury trial; those defendants facing six months' incarceration or less are entitled to a bench trial before a judge. Defendants in summons court may waive their right to a trial before a judge and have the trial held by a judicial hearing officer.\n\nAppeals are to the Appellate Terms of the New York Supreme Court, established separately in the First Department (Manhattan and the Bronx) and Second Department (Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island) of the Appellate Division.\n\nThere are several specialized parts of the Criminal Court which handle specific subject areas.\n\nDefendants arraigned on felony or misdemeanor complaints are initially arraigned in the arraignment part of the Criminal Court.\n\nThe all-purpose or \"AP\" parts are the motion parts of the Criminal Court. Plea bargain negotiations take place in these courtrooms prior to the case being in a trial-ready posture, and depending upon caseloads the judges in the AP Parts may conduct pre-trial hearings, felony hearings, and bench trials.\n\nCriminal Court has preliminary jurisdiction over felony cases filed in New York City, and retains jurisdiction of the felony cases until a grand jury hears the case and indicts the defendant. Defendants charged with felonies are arraigned in the Criminal Court arraignment parts and cases are then usually sent to a felony waiver part to await grand jury action. Felony waiver parts are staffed by Criminal Court judges designated as Acting Supreme Court Justices. Felony waiver parts also hear motions, bail applications, and extradition matters.\n\nTrial Parts in the Criminal Court handle most of the trials, although some trials are conducted in the AP parts.\n\nThe state court system has a number of problem-solving courts. The Midtown Community Court is a community court which arraigns defendants who are arrested in the Times Square, Hell's Kitchen, and Chelsea neighborhoods and charged with any non-felony offense. The Red Hook Community Justice Center is a multi-jurisdictional community court in Red Hook, Brooklyn, for example hearing family, civil and criminal \"quality of life\" cases, as well as youth court, and uses mediation, restitution, community service orders and drug treatment.\n\nCriminal Court operates domestic violence or \"DV\" courts within every county. Domestic violence courts are forums that focus on crimes related to domestic violence and abuse and improving the administration of justice surrounding these types of crimes. The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens operates DV Complexes, which include an All-Purpose Part and Trial Parts dedicated to adjudicating these types of crimes, while in Richmond all DV cases are heard in the regular AP Part.\n\nThe Summons All Purpose Part (SAP) hears cases brought to court by universal summonses issued by law enforcement personnel. Summons court handles low-level offenses. Defendants may waive their right to a trial before a judge and have the trial held by a judicial hearing officer.\n\nThe District Attorney does not staff the SAP Part. The NYPD's Legal Bureau has a memorandum of understanding with the Manhattan District Attorney allowing the NYPD to selectively prosecute summons court cases. The summons court is sometimes called the \"People's Court\" because Criminal Court judges routinely authorize summonses and informations based upon the sworn allegations of private citizens who seek redress for criminal acts against them, and the entire proceeding is generally one of private or court-conducted trial.\n\nThe state court system is divided into thirteen judicial districts (JDs), with five JDs in New York City, one for each county/borough. An Administrator (or Administrative Judge if a judge) supervises the Criminal Court. The Deputy Chief Administrator for the New York City Courts (or Deputy Chief Administrative Judge if a judge) is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the trial-level courts located in New York City, and works with the Administrator of the Criminal Court in order to allocate and assign judicial and nonjudicial personnel resources to meet the needs and goals of those courts.\n\nThe Criminal Court Administrator is assisted by Supervising Judges who are responsible in the on-site management of the trial courts, including court caseloads, personnel, and budget administration, and each manage a particular type of court within a county or judicial district. Chief Clerks (inside New York City) assist the local administrators in carrying out their responsibilities for supervising the day-to-day operations of the trial courts. Once a judge is appointed by the Mayor to the Criminal Court, they can be transferred from one court to another by the Office of Court Administration, and after two years' service in the lower courts, they may be designated by the Chief Administrator of the Courts as an Acting Supreme Court Justice with the same jurisdiction as a Supreme Court Justice upon consultation and agreement with the presiding justice of the appropriate Appellate Division.\n\nThe court is not included in the New York State Courts Electronic Filing System (NYSCEF).\n\nNew York City Criminal Court judges are appointed by the Mayor of New York City to 10-year terms from a list of candidates submitted by the Mayor's Advisory Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nThe Mayor's Advisory Committee is composed of up to nineteen members, all of whom are volunteers and are appointed with the Mayor's approval: the Mayor selects nine members; the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals nominates four members; the Presiding Justices of the Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments each nominate two members; and deans of the law schools within New York City, on an annual rotating basis, each nominate one member. In addition, the Committee on the Judiciary of the New York City Bar Association, in conjunction with the county bar association in the relevant county, investigates and evaluates the qualifications of all candidates for judicial office in New York City.\n\nOnce a judge is appointed by the Mayor to the Criminal Court, they can be transferred from one court to another by the Office of Court Administration, and after two years' service in the lower courts, they may be designated by the Chief Administrator of the Courts as an Acting Supreme Court Justice with the same jurisdiction as a Supreme Court Justice upon consultation and agreement with the presiding justice of the appropriate Appellate Division. The mayor may appoint 107 Criminal Court judges, but only about 73 to 74 currently work in Criminal Court: 46 of these are mayorally appointed Criminal Court judges, and the remaining 27 are Civil Court judges (some elected and some mayorally appointed) assigned to Criminal Court; the other approximately 60 mayorally appointed Criminal Court judges have been designated Acting Supreme Court judges to sit in Supreme Court hearing felony cases.\n\nJudicial hearing officers (JHOs) adjudicate most summons court (SAP Part) cases, assist in compliance parts in domestic violence cases, and in the New York Supreme Court monitor substance abuse program defendants, conduct pre-trial suppression hearings and make recommended findings of fact and law to sitting judges. JHOs are appointed by the Chief Administrator.\n\nBy law, the city must provide criminal representation by any combination of a public defender, legal aid society, and/or panel of qualified lawyers (pursuant to County Law article 18-B). The Legal Aid Society is contracted as the city's primary provider of criminal legal aid, along with New York County Defender Services in Manhattan, Brooklyn Defender Services in Brooklyn, The Bronx Defenders in the Bronx, Queens Defenders in Queens, and the Neighborhood Defender Service in northern Manhattan. For a comparison of relative activity in 2009, legal aid societies handled 290,251 cases of which 568 went to trial, whereas 18-B lawyers represented 42,212 defendants of which 623 went to trial.\n\nThe District Attorney does not staff the summons court (SAP Part), and the summons court proceedings are generally one of a private or court-conducted trial. District attorneys are legally permitted to delegate the prosecution of petty crimes or offenses, and the NYPD's Legal Bureau has a memorandum of understanding with the district attorneys, at least in Manhattan, allowing the NYPD to selectively prosecute summons court cases.\n\nThe Court of Appeals ruled in 1991 that most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours. In 2013, for the first time since 2001, the average time it took to arraign defendants fell below 24 hours in all five boroughs.\n\nBut there have been accusations of systematic trial delays, especially with regards to the New York City stop-and-frisk program. Out of more than 11,000 misdemeanor cases pending in 2012 in the Bronx, there were 300 misdemeanor trials. The Bronx criminal courts were responsible for more than half of the cases in New York City's criminal courts that were over two years old, and for two-thirds of the defendants waiting for their trials in jail for more than five years. In 2016, councilman Rory Lancman, noting that only about half of the about 107 appointed Criminal Court judges currently serve because the Chief Administrative Judge and Office of Court Administration have transferred them to Supreme Court to hear felony cases, said major reasons for the backlogs were a shortage of judges, court officers and courtrooms; a haphazard discovery process that frustrates timely plea deal negotiations; and a speedy trial statute unique to New York that allows the parties to game the system. \"The New York Times\" editorial board has criticized the Criminal Court judges for rarely excusing defendants from having to show up at every court appearance, as allowed by law, instead requiring them \"to return to court every several weeks and spend all day waiting for their cases to be called, only to be told that the proceedings are being put off for another month ... [meaning] these defendants miss work, lose wages and in some cases their jobs.\"\n\nNew York City's use of remand (pre-trial detention) has also been criticized. Almost without exception, New York judges only set two kinds of bail at arraignment, straight cash or commercial bail bond, while other options exist such as partially secured bonds, which only require a tenth of the full amount as a down payment to the court (and presumably refunded when redeemed), and unsecured bonds, which don't require any up front payment. The New York City Criminal Justice Agency has stated that only 44 percent of defendants offered bail are released before their case concludes. A report by Human Rights Watch found that among defendants arrested in New York City in 2008 on nonfelony charges who had bail set at $1,000 or less, 87 percent were jailed because they were unable to post the bail amount at their arraignment, and that 39 percent of the city's jail population consisted of pre-trial detainees who were in jail because they had not posted bail. A report by the Vera Institute of Justice concluded that, in Manhattan, black and Latino defendants were more likely to be held in jail before trial and more likely to be offered plea bargains that include a prison sentence than whites and Asians charged with the same crimes.\n\nIt is said that excessive pre-trial detention and the accompanying systematic trial delays are used to pressure defendants to accept plea bargains.\n\nIn June 2014 it was reported that Brooklyn's change to a more wealthy, more Caucasian population has had a negative effect for defendants in the criminal cases of Brooklyn, which is largely composed of minorities, and reductions in awards in civil cases. It was called the Williamsburg effect because of that neighborhood's gentrification. Brooklyn defense lawyer Julie Clark said that these new jurors are \"much more trusting of police.\" Another lawyer, Arthur Aidala said:\n\nBrooklyn district attorney Kenneth P. Thompson had argued that most people don't understand how summons court operates, resulting in missed court dates and automatic bench warrants; that the omission of race and ethnicity information on the summons form should be remedied, to provide statistics of summons recipients; that poor access to public defenders by indigent persons in summons courts raises serious due process concerns; and that the city needs to overhaul its summons system, to handle quality-of-life infractions better and in a timely manner.\n\nThe Court of Special Sessions was created in 1744, from a court created in 1732. (The New York County Court of General Sessions tried felonies as a county court, whereas Bronx, Kings, Queens, and Richmond counties had a regular County Court. On 17 October 1683 the Court of General Sessions was established as a county court. On 1 January 1896, all courts of sessions outside New York County were abolished and their jurisdiction transferred to the County Court.) The New York City Court of Special Sessions tried misdemeanors like other cities' police courts, and the New York City Magistrates' Courts tried petty criminal cases.\n\nIn the early 1950s it was reported that the New York State Crime Commission was investigating bribery (kickbacks) in the courts and implicated the political parties' judicial nominating conventions, and in 1953 Governor Tom Dewey publicly called for reform. The Criminal Court was established effective 1 September 1962 by the New York City Criminal Court Act of the 173rd New York State Legislature and Governor Nelson Rockefeller, replacing the City Magistrates' Courts and the Court of Special Sessions. (The work and personnel of the New York County Court of General Sessions, and the County Court in Bronx, Kings, Queens, and Richmond counties, were transferred to the Supreme Court.)\n\nIn 1969–1970, extrajudicial administrative courts were created to offload a large volume of cases from the Criminal Court: the state DMV Traffic Violations Bureau (TVB), which adjudicates non-parking traffic violations, and the city DOF Parking Violations Bureau, which adjudicates parking violations.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252504", "title": "Jean-Marie Guyau", "text": "Jean-Marie Guyau\n\nJean-Marie Guyau (October 28, 1854 – March 31, 1888) was a French philosopher and poet.\n\nGuyau was inspired by the philosophies of Epicurus, Epictetus, Plato, Immanuel Kant, Herbert Spencer, and Alfred Fouillée, and the poetry and literature of Pierre Corneille, Victor Hugo, and Alfred de Musset.\n\nGuyau was first exposed to Plato and Kant, as well as the history of religions and philosophy in his youth through his stepfather, the noted French philosopher Alfred Fouillée. With this background, he was able to attain his Bachelor of Arts at only 17 years of age, and at this time, translated the \"Handbook\" of Epictetus. At 19, he published his 1300-page \"Mémoire\" that, a year later in 1874, won a prize from the French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences and helped to earn him a philosophy lectureship at the Lycée Condorcet. However, this was short-lived, as he soon began to suffer from pulmonary disease. Following the first attacks of his disease, he went to southern France where he wrote philosophical works and poetry. He remained there until his early death at 33 years of age.\n\nHis mother, (who married Fouillée after Guyau's birth), published \"Le Tour de France par deux enfants\" in 1877 under the pseudonym G. Bruno.\n\nGuyau's wife published short novels for young people under the pseudonym of Pierre Ulric.\n\nGuyau's works primarily analyze and respond to modern philosophy, especially moral philosophy. Largely seen as an Epicurean, he viewed English utilitarianism as a modern version of Epicureanism. Although an enthusiastic admirer of the works of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, he did not spare them a careful scrutiny of their approach to morality. \n\nIn his \"Esquisse d'une morale sans obligation ni sanction\", probably his most important work on moral theory, he begins from Fouillée, maintaining that utilitarian and positivist schools, despite admitting the presence of an unknowable in moral theory, wrongly expel individual hypotheses directed towards this unknowable. He states that any valid theory of ethics must consider the moral sphere as consisting not merely of moral facts (the utilitarian approach) but also, and more importantly, of moral ideas. On the other hand, in contrast to Fouillée, he does not see this unknowable itself as able to contribute a \"principle practically limiting and restricting conduct,\" i.e. of \"mere justice\" which, he states, comes too close to Kantian notions of duty; for this, in turn, would bring us back to a theory of moral obligation, which, as the title suggests, he wishes to free moral theory from. Much of his treatise is dedicated to arguing what moral theory can be based upon that relieves moral theorists from relying on e.g. duty, sanctions, and obligations. For example,\n\n\nGuyau also took interest in aesthetic theory, particularly its role in society and social evolution. Primarily, Guyau's theories of aesthetics refute Immanuel Kant's idea that aesthetic judgment is disinterested, and accordingly, partitioned off from the faculties of mind responsible for moral judgement. In \"Les Problèmes de l'esthétique contemporaine\", Guyau argues that beauty in fact activates all dimensions of the mind—the sensual, the intellectual, and the moral. Aesthetic sensations are fully integrated with life and morality. They are also the mark of man's self-actualization. Contrary to Herbert Spencer's theory that the development of the arts is an indicator of the decline of society at large, Guyau maintains that as society continues to evolve, life will become increasingly aesthetic. In \"L'Art au point de vue sociologique\", Guyau argues the purpose of art is not to merely produce pleasure, but to create sympathy among members of a society. By extension, he contends that art has the power to reform societies as well as to form them anew.\n\nAlthough Guyau is now a relatively obscure philosopher, his approach to philosophy earned him much praise from those who knew of him and his philosophy. Because he rarely made his political ideology explicit, Guyau has been portrayed as a socialist, an anarchist, and as a libertarian liberal in the style of John Stuart Mill. However, Guyau clearly expressed republican sympathies in which he praised the French Revolution, saluted the Third Republic's promotion of civic and moral education, described voting as a \"duty,\" and cautiously argued that democracy offered propitious conditions for creative development.\n\nHe is the original source of the notion of anomie, which found much use in the philosophy of Guyau's contemporary Émile Durkheim, who stumbled upon it in a review of \"Irréligion de l'avenir\". He is admired and well-quoted by the anarchist Peter Kropotkin, in Kropotkin's works on ethics, where Guyau is described as an anarchist. Peter Kropotkin devotes an entire chapter to Guyau in his \"\", describing Guyau's moral teaching as \"so carefully conceived, and expounded in so perfect a form, that it is a simple matter to convey its essence in a few words\", while the American philosopher Josiah Royce considered him as \"one of the most prominent of recent French philosophical critics.\"\n\n\n"}

She began her career as an original cast member of the long-running Sydney-based male revue Les Girls (pronounced \"lay-girls\") cabaret show, which had an international following (including being attended by numerous celebrities) and started in 1962 in Sydney's Kings Cross. Carlotta performed spot-numbers as a singer and comedian, and eventually became the show's compere and lead attraction. Her appearance in the television series \"Number 96\" as Miss Robyn Ross, is the first time a transgender actress played a transgender TV character anywhere in the world. \nCarlotta was born in Balmain, New South Wales, in 1943. As a child, she was taught song-and-dance routines by her mother. Neither her mother nor her stepfather approved of her subsequent transgender performing career. She had sex reassignment surgery in 1971 which, though not the first such procedure in Australia, was the first to receive major publicity. In 2018, she revealed she had bladder cancer. She says it was discovered early and had the tumor surgically removed.\n\nHer stage name was sourced from that of Empress Carlota of Mexico. Managed by impresario Lee Gordon, who had toured to Australia such stars as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, she began her career as an original cast member of the long-running stage male revue Les Girls (pronounced \"lay-girls\") cabaret show, which started in 1962 in the purpose-built nightclub building owned by Abe Saffron in the heart of Sydney's Kings Cross. The revue was performed exclusively by males in drag costume, and Carlotta performed spot-numbers as a singer and comedian. She eventually became known as \"The Queen of The Cross\" as the show's compere and lead attraction, performing also in Leagues clubs while touring with the show.\n\nShe also appeared in the 1970 film \"The Naked Bunyip.\"\n\n\"Les Girls\" and Carlotta became an attraction for visitors to Sydney. Carlotta departed in 1992. Inspired by the film \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\", she mounted a revue, \"Carlotta & Her Beautiful Boys\", planning to tour Australia. This was not a financial success, bankrupting her, after which she mainly appeared as a one-woman performer.\nCarlotta (credited as \"Carolle Lea\") appeared in the soap opera \"Number 96\" in 1973 as Robyn Ross, the new girlfriend of Arnold Feather (portrayed by Jeff Kevin). In the story it was soon revealed that Robyn was in fact a transsexual showgirl, a revelation that led to the end of her romance, meaning she left the show. It is the first time anywhere in the world a trans TV character would be played by a trans actress.\n\nFrom 1997, Carlotta became a regular panellist on the talk show \"Beauty and the Beast\", hosted by Stan Zemanek. Between 2013 and 2018, she made regular appearances as a panel member on morning show Studio 10.\n\nA 90-minute telemovie, \"Carlotta\", was screened in June 2014 with Jessica Marais acting the title role. The film \"presents a romanticised perspective that offers only hints of the harsher realities of Byron's complex life.\"\n\nIn 2005, she presented her own half-million-dollar stage production, \"Carlotta's KingsX\", in the Big Top at Luna Park, Sydney, based on her 2003 book \"I'm Not That Kind of Girl.\" Produced by Brett Elliott and Richard Bernardo, the 90-minute show consisted of classic storytelling, stand-up comedy, lavish costumes, and \"Les Girls\" dance performances throughout. She has also toured with her one-woman show \"Carlotta: Live and Intimate\".\nIn 2019, aged 75 she still continues to tour, performing such songs by Irving Berlin, Rodgers and Hart, Stephen Sondheim and her late friend Peter Allen, performing with a three-piece band headed by Michael Griffiths.\nCarlotta was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) on 26 January 2020 for services to the performing arts and the LGBTIQ community. She has also been awarded The Kings Cross Award for services to tourism, the Drag Industry Variety Award, and the Australian Club Entertainment Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2018, a bronze sculpture was dedicated to her in Kings Cross, where she also has a star on the pavement.\n\nCarlotta has published 2 books\n"}

NYLIC has about $593 billion in total assets under management, and more than $25 billion in surplus and AVR. In 2007, NYLIC achieved the best possible ratings by the four independent rating companies (Standard & Poor's, AM Best, Moody's and Fitch). Other New York Life affiliates provide an array of securities products and services, as well as institutional and retail mutual funds.\n\nNew York Life Insurance Company first opened in Manhattan's Financial District as \"Nautilus Mutual Life\" in 1841, 10 years after the first life insurance charter was granted in the United States. Originally chartered in 1841, the company also sold fire and marine insurance. The company's first president, James De Peyster Ogden, was appointed in 1845. Nautilus renamed itself New York Life Insurance Company in 1845 to concentrate on its life insurance business.\n\nIn its early years (1846–1848) the company, along with other insurance companies of the day including Aetna and US Life, insured the lives of slaves for their owners. By 1847 these accounted for onethird of New York Life's policies. The board of trustees voted to end the sale of insurance policies on slaves in 1848. The company also sold policies to soldiers and civilians involved in combat during the American Civil War and paid claims under a flag of truce during that time. In the late 1800s, the company began employing female agents.\n\nNew York Life continued to grow throughout its first 100 years as the national population and the market for life insurance increased. New York Life's growth was in part fueled by its introduction of a system by which the company used agents to find new business. In 1892, company President John A. McCall introduced the branch office system: offices that served as liaisons between New York and field agents.\n\nIn 1894, the company became the first US-based insurance provider to offer life insurance to women at the same cost as men; social reformer Susan B. Anthony was one of the company's first female policyholders. In 1896, New York Life became the first company to insure people with disabilities or in hazardous occupations.\n\nThe New York Life Building at 51 Madison Avenue in Manhattan, designed by American architect Cass Gilbert, opened in December 1928. The company moved into the 34-story skyscraper in 1929. Later that year, New York Life's assets survived the stock market crash; state regulation and company investing policy had led New York Life to invest in government bonds and real estate, not common stocks.\n\nFollowing World War II, New York Life further diversified; it invested in real estate development in the late 1940s and launched a mortgage-loan program for veterans in 1946. In 1957, New York Life hired one of the industry's first black agents, Cirilo McSween. In the 1970s, New York Life began selling annuities and mutual funds. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, as other mutual life insurance companies became publicly traded corporations, New York Life remained a mutual company. New York Life entered the Mexican market in 1999 when it acquired Seguros Monterrey from Aetna.\n\nNew York Life, along with other insurance companies, relaxed the claims process for missing persons in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Fearful of the stability of the market during the two years prior to the financial crisis of 2007–2008, New York Life moved its cash into other investments such as treasury bonds. In the ensuing financial crisis, New York Life Insurance Company rejected assistance from the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nFollowing the 2013 acquisition of Dexia Asset Management, later renamed Candriam Investors Group, New York Life Investments became one of the largest asset managers worldwide, with access to markets in Europe, Asia and Australia, in addition to the United States.\n\nAs of 2016, New York Life Insurance Company was the country's third-largest life insurance company. A mutual insurance company, New York Life is owned by its policyholders and has no outside shareholders. As a mutual, New York Life distributes a portion of its earnings to eligible policyholders as annual dividends. As of 2016, the company has paid a dividend every year since 1854. Through Seguros Monterrey New York Life, the company offers insurance in Mexico.\n\nNew York Life's core product is whole life insurance, a type of life insurance offering lifelong protection that builds cash value over time. New York Life also sells term life insurance, universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuities. The company operates New York Life Direct, selling direct-to-consumer policies, and is the exclusive life insurance partner of the AARP.\n\nNew York Life's global asset management business serves both institutional and retail clients. New York Life Investments ranks No. 26 by total worldwide institutional assets under management, according to \"Pensions & Investments\"' Largest Money Managers Survey 2017.\n\nThe group manages money through independent investment boutiques. These boutiques include:\n\nNew York Life Foundation is the insurance company's philanthropic arm. Its areas of focus include childhood bereavement. New York Life Foundation first became involved in childhood bereavement programs when it supported the Comfort Zone Camp in 2007. Its partners and programs include the National Alliance of Grieving Children, Grief Reach, Coalition to Support Grieving Students, Camp Erin/Moyer Foundation, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors and Boys and Girls Clubs of America. It sponsored the HBO documentary \"One Last Hug\".\n\nThe company also emphasizes giving to various cultural communities, including the African-American community. The company also funded a $10 million endowment to the Colin Powell Center for Policy Studies at the City College of New York called the New York Life Endowment for Emerging African-American Issues in 2006.\n\nIn June 2018, New York Life ranks No. 69 on the Fortune 500. In 2017 \"Fortune\" named New York Life among its Most Admired Companies in the life insurance industry. \"Forbes\" ranked New York Life #364 among America’s Best Employers for 2017.

It handles about 25% of all the New York state and local courts' total filings. The court has divisions by county (borough), but it is a single citywide court.\n\nLandlords in New York City may use a blacklist of persons who have appeared in housing court as a plaintiff or defendant. Known among housing advocates and lawyers as the tenant blacklist, it is compiled by tenant-screening database companies from housing court records.\n\nThe Civil Court has monetary jurisdiction up to $25,000, including replevin when the value of the chattel does not exceed that amount, real property actions such as partitions, and foreclosures within the monetary limit, and also has equity jurisdiction limited to real property actions, ejectment actions, and actions to rescind or reform a contract not involving more than the $25,000 jurisdictional limit.\n\nThe court's divisions are by each county (borough). In each division there are a number of court parts established by the Chief Administrative Judge:\n\n\nNew York City Civil Court judges are elected countywide or from districts to 10-year terms, with vacancies filled by the mayor and with their service continuing until the last day of December after next election. The Legislature has consistently opted to fill judgeships using the preexisting mixed pattern of countywide and Municipal Court districts— \n\nA candidate needs to file petitions to be considered a candidate for a political party's nomination in the general election; petitions containing 4,000 signatures are needed for a county-wide seat, and petitions containing 1,500 signatures are necessary for a district seat. Party leaders frequently designate candidates for the Civil Court judgeships, who then face an open primary against others who qualify for the ballot. The party machine usually manages to elect most of its judicial candidates.\n\nHousing Part judges are appointed by the Chief Administrative Judge to five-year terms. Civil Court or Family Court Judges may be assigned by the New York Chief Judge to the Supreme Court and are referred to as \"Acting Supreme Court Judges\". The Chief Judge of New York, in consultation with the Chief Administrative Judge, Administrative Judges, Supervising Judges and the Presiding Justice of the relevant Appellate Division, assigns judges to sit in the county in which they were selected or another county, for example a judge elected to New York City Civil Court in Manhattan could be assigned to Family Court in the Bronx, although an acting Supreme Court judge is usually assigned to the county in which they were elected.\n\nWith the consent of the parties, a volunteer arbitrator hears and decides disputes in small claims parts. Over 2800 arbitrators preside over 95% of the cases heard in small claims parts. They are appointed by the administrative judge of the court.\n\nIn 1759, so-called justices' courts held by the mayor, recorder or an alderman could try cases in controversy of not more than £5. In 1781, they were replaced by assistant justices' courts held by associate justices appointed by the governor. In 1787, these were replaced by assistant justices with the power of justices of the peace in other counties. In 1797, these were replaced with justices of the peace for the city and county of New York and were constituted as one court.\n\nIn 1807-1808 these were replaced by justices' courts and assistants justices' courts. In 1819, the justices' courts were replaced by the marine court of the city of New York, and in 1883 was renamed as the City Court of the City of New York. In 1852, the assistant justices' courts were renamed as the District Courts in the City of New York, and by the city charter in 1897 the district courts of New York City and justices' courts of Brooklyn and Long Island City were consolidated into the Municipal Court of the City of New York. In 1962, the City Court of the City of New York and the Municipal Court of the City of New York were consolidated and replaced by the current Civil Court.\n\n\n\n"}

Conversion between extended-release and immediate-release (or \"regular\") morphine is easier than conversion to or from an equianalgesic dose of another opioid with different half-life, with less risk of altered pharmacodynamics.\n\nBrand names for this formulation of morphine include Avinza, Kadian, MS Contin, MST Continus, Morphagesic, Zomorph, Filnarine, MXL and Dolcontin. MS Contin is a trademark of Purdue Pharma, and is available in the United States, and Australia. In the UK, MS Contin is marketed by NAPP Pharmaceuticals as MST Continus. MS Contin is a DEA Schedule II substance in the United States, a Schedule 8 (controlled) drug in Australia and a Schedule 2 CD (Controlled Drug) in the UK.\n\nAvinza is made by King Pharmaceuticals and Kadian is made by Actavis Pharmaceuticals. Unlike the MS Contin brand and its generic versions, Kadian and Avinza are designed to be 12- to 24-hour release, not 8- to 12-hour. So instead of 2-3 times a day dosing, it can be 1-2 times.\n\nMST Continus and MXL are registered copyright and trademark of Napp Pharmaceuticals and are available in the UK. MXL is a 24-hour release formula designed to be taken once daily. It is available in doses between 30 mg and 200 mg in 30 mg intervals (equating to between 1.25 mg/hour and 8.33 mg/hour). MST Continus is a 12-hour release formula, therefore it is given 2 times per day. It is available in the following doses: 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg tablets (equating to between 0.83 mg/hour and 16.67 mg/hour).\n\nFor constant pain, the relieving effect of extended-release morphine given once (for Kadian) or twice (for MS Contin) every 24 hours is roughly the same as multiple administrations of \"immediate release\" (or \"regular\") morphine. Morphine sulfate pentahydrade (trade names including Dolcontin) has a higher molecular mass than morphine base, and therefore 10 mg morphine sulfate pentahydrate contains approximatively 7.5 mg of morphine free base. Extended-release morphine can be administered together with \"rescue doses\" of immediate-release morphine pro re nata in case of breakthrough pain, each generally consisting of 5% to 15% of the 24-hour extended-release dosage.\n\nPellet (spheroid) formulations (made by extrusion and spheronization) can be used for controlled release of the drug in the body whereas powder filled pellets generally cannot. The plastic spheres containing powder have micropores that open at varying PH levels, to maintain a mostly constant release during transit through the digestive tract. The spheres themselves, the outer shells, pass undigested in most patients. Another use these style medications have is that they can be given via NG tube, the pellets being very small.

The length of time in treatment was not found to be significantly different.\n\n"}

Interested in traditionally male pursuits from an early age, she became one of the Crows' most significant leaders, joining the Council of Chiefs as the third ranking member. She attracted substantial attention from Western visitors; she may be the same person as \"Pine Leaf\" described by James Beckwourth, though the accuracy of this account is challenged.\n\nThe woman eventually known as Woman Chief was born to the Gros Ventres people; her birth name is unknown. At the age of about 10 she was taken prisoner by a raiding party of Crows, and was adopted by a Crow warrior who raised her among his people. She showed a disposition to assume traditionally male activities, and her foster father evidently encouraged her pursuits, as he had lost his sons to death or capture. She earned acclaim for her horse riding, marksmanship, and ability to field-dress a buffalo. However, unlike other Two-Spirits, she wore typical female clothing rather than adopting men's garments. When her father died, she assumed leadership of his lodge.\n\nShe gained renown as a warrior during a raid by the Blackfoot on a fort sheltering Crow and white families. She reportedly fought off multiple attackers and was instrumental in turning back the raid. She subsequently raised her own band of warriors and raided Blackfoot settlements, taking off many horses and scalps. For her deeds she was accepted to represent her lodge as \"bacheeítche\" (chief) in the Council of Chiefs and was given the name \"Bíawacheeitchish\", or Woman Chief. She eventually rose to the rank of third among the Council's 160 lodges. She married four wives, which increased the wealth and prestige of her lodge. She became involved in peace negotiations with other Upper Missouri tribes following the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie, and successfully negotiated peace with the Gros Ventres, the tribe of her birth. After several years of peace, Woman Chief was ambushed and killed by a Gros Ventres party.\n\nWestern visitors who met Woman Chief, including Edwin Denig and Rudolph Kurz, were fascinated with her. Typically, they considered her an exotic figure among the patriarchal Crow and likened her to the Amazons of European myth. Their accounts are now considered biased, though they provide valuable details about Woman Chief's life. James Beckwourth wrote about a Crow warrior named Bar-chee-am-pe, or Pine Leaf, who may be identified with Woman Chief. Some details of Pine Leaf's life match what is known of Woman Chief, though Beckwourth's account appears to be greatly exaggerated, if not entirely fictional. Beckwourth claimed to have met Pine Leaf while living with the Crow in the 1820s. He wrote that she was a formidable warrior who vowed to kill one hundred enemies before she would marry. He further claimed to have had a romantic relationship with her and to have proposed marriage. Among those challenging Beckwourth's account was Bernard DeVoto, who wrote that Beckwourth is reliable save for three areas: numbers, romance, and his own importance.\n\nBeside Woman Chief there were other known warrior women of the Crow Nation, including Akkeekaahuush (Comes Toward The Near Bank, c. 1810 – 1880) and Biliíche Héeleelash (Among The Willows, c. 1837 – 1912), the latter a prominent war leader (pipe carrier).\n\n"}

It was the one of a line of defenses constructed by American forces in the campaign leading to the Northwest Indian War's Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794.\n\nWork began on August 9, 1794 and was completed by August 17. The name was derived from a declaration by Charles Scott, who was leading a band of Kentucky militiamen in support of Wayne, that: \"I defy the English, Indians, and all the devils of hell to take it.\" The post was considered one of the strongest fortifications built in that period.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Fallen Timbers, Wayne ordered the destruction of all Native American villages and their crops within a radius of the fort. Under terms of the Treaty of Greenville, signed on August 3, 1795, the native nations ceded six square miles around the fort and allowed the Americans to maintain a trading post there, even though it was within the area of land defined by the \"Greenville Treaty Line\", beyond which Americans had agreed not to settle. The fort was abandoned in 1796.\n\nFort Winchester was constructed on a nearby site in 1812 by Gen. William Henry Harrison.\n\nThe city of Defiance, Ohio, was founded at the fort's location in 1822. In 1904, the site of the fort was chosen for the Defiance Public Library.\n\nFort Defiance served as a reference point for defining the boundary line of land cession in the Treaty of Detroit in 1807.

{"id": "2252549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252549", "title": "Ventricular remodeling", "text": "Ventricular remodeling\n\nIn cardiology, ventricular remodeling (or cardiac remodeling) refers to changes in the size, shape, structure, and function of the heart. This can happen as a result of exercise (physiological remodeling) or after injury to the heart muscle (pathological remodeling). The injury is typically due to acute myocardial infarction (usually transmural or ST segment elevation infarction), but may be from a number of causes that result in increased pressure or volume, causing pressure overload or volume overload (forms of strain) on the heart. Chronic hypertension, congenital heart disease with intracardiac shunting, and valvular heart disease may also lead to remodeling. After the insult occurs, a series of histopathological and structural changes occur in the left ventricular myocardium that lead to progressive decline in left ventricular performance. Ultimately, ventricular remodeling may result in diminished contractile (systolic) function and reduced stroke volume.\n\nPhysiological remodeling is reversible while pathological remodeling is mostly irreversible. Remodeling of the ventricles under left/right pressure demand make mismatches inevitable. Pathologic pressure mismatches between the pulmonary and systemic circulation guide compensatory remodeling of the left and right ventricles. The term \"reverse remodeling\" in cardiology implies an improvement in ventricular mechanics and function following a remote injury or pathological process.\n\nVentricular remodeling may include ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular dilation, cardiomegaly, and other changes. It is an aspect of cardiomyopathy, of which there are many types. Concentric hypertrophy is due to pressure overload, while eccentric hypertrophy is due to volume overload.\n\nThe cardiac myocyte is the major cell involved in remodeling. Fibroblasts, collagen, the interstitium, and the coronary vessels to a lesser extent, also play a role. A common scenario for remodeling is after myocardial infarction. There is myocardial necrosis (cell death) and disproportionate thinning of the heart. This thin, weakened area is unable to withstand the pressure and volume load on the heart in the same manner as the other healthy tissue. As a result, there is dilatation of the chamber arising from the infarct region. The initial remodeling phase after a myocardial infarction results in repair of the necrotic area and myocardial scarring that may, to some extent, be considered beneficial since there is an improvement in or maintenance of LV function and cardiac output. Over time, however, as the heart undergoes ongoing remodeling, it becomes less elliptical and more spherical. Ventricular mass and volume increase, which together adversely affect cardiac function. Eventually, diastolic function, or the heart's ability to relax between contractions may become impaired, further causing decline.\n\nAfter a myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac myocyte death can be triggered by necrosis, apoptosis, or autophagy, leading to thinning of the cardiac wall. The surviving cardiac myocytes either arrange in parallel or in series to each other, contributing to ventricular dilatation or ventricular hypertrophy, depending on the loading stress on the ventricular wall. Besides, reduced expression of V1 mysoin and L-type calcium channels on cardiac myocytes are also thought to cause cardiac remodelling. Under normal body conditions, fatty acid accounts for 60 to 90% of the energy supply of the heart. Post MI, as fatty acid oxidation decreases, it leads to reduced energy supply for the cardiac myocytes, accumulation of fatty acids to toxic levels, and dysfunction of mitochondria. These consequences also led to the increase in oxidative stress on the heart, causing the proliferation of fibroblasts, activation of metalloproteinases, and induction of apoptosis, which would be explained below. Besides, inflammatory immune response after MI also contributes to the above changes.\n\nBesides, the cardiac interstitium which consisted of largely Type I and Type III collagen fibres are also involved in cardiac remodeling. Cardiac collagen is synthesized by fibroblasts and degraded by metalloproteinases. Fibroblasts are activated post MI, leading to increased collagen synthesis and fibrosis of the heart. Increase expression of MMP1 and MMP9 led to degradation of collagen fibres, and subsequently dilatation of the heart. Several signal pathways such as Angiotensin II, Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and Endothelin 1 are known to trigger synthesis and degradation of collagen fibres in the heart.\n\nOther factors such as high blood pressure, activation of sympathetic system which releases norepinephrine, activation of renin–angiotensin system which releases renin and anti-diuretic hormones are important contributors of cardiac remodelling. However, atrial natriuretic peptide is thought to be cardio-protective.\n\nRemodeling of the heart is evaluated by performing an echocardiogram. The size and function of the atria and ventricles can be characterized using this test.\n\nMany factors influence the time course and extent of remodeling, including the severity of the injury, secondary events (recurrent ischemia or infarction), neurohormonal activation, genetic factors and gene expression, and treatment. Medications may attenuate remodeling. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been consistently shown to decrease remodeling in animal models or transmural infarction and chronic pressure overload. Clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibitor therapy after myocardial infarction leads to improved myocardial performance, improved ejection fraction, and decreased mortality compared to patients treated with placebo. Likewise, inhibition of aldosterone, either directly or indirectly, leads to improvement in remodeling. Carvedilol, a 3rd generation beta blocker, may actually reverse the remodeling process by reducing left ventricular volumes and improving systolic function. Early correction of congenital heart defects, if appropriate, may prevent remodeling, as will treatment of chronic hypertension or valvular heart disease. Often, reverse remodeling, or improvement in left ventricular function, will also be seen.\n\n"}

It is located at 84 degrees, 21 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude at its northern terminus at Sault Ste. Marie, and varies very little from that line down the length of the state.\n\nThe meridian was surveyed by Benjamin Hough in April 1815. The meridian was selected because it formed one of the principal boundary lines defined in the Treaty of Detroit in 1807, which was the first large cession of land by Native American peoples to the United States in the Michigan Territory. In that treaty, the boundary line was described as running due north from the mouth of the Auglaize River on the Maumee River, which was the site of Fort Defiance (now Defiance, Ohio).\n\nMichigan's baseline, which today forms the northern border of Wayne, Washtenaw and other counties, was surveyed at the same time by Alexander Holmes. Although regulations governing the U.S. Public Land Survey System would later specify that the baseline should be a true parallel of latitude, this was not the case in earlier surveys, including the Michigan survey. Some roadways were laid out for both survey lines, but there was no intersecting of roadways coinciding with the intersecting of survey lines. Several segments of the Michigan Meridian correspond with a road bearing the name Meridian Road.\n\nThe Michigan meridian forms the boundary between several counties in Michigan: Lenawee and Hillsdale; Shiawassee and Clinton; Saginaw and Gratiot; Ogemaw and Roscommon; Oscoda and Crawford; Montmorency and Otsego; and a portion of the boundary between Chippewa and Mackinac. U.S. Highway 127 approximately follows the meridian from the Ohio border into Jackson. In Okemos, there is a historical village of Meridian located on the line. Both it and Okemos are within Meridian Township, State highways M-30 in Midland and Gladwin counties, and M-129 in Chippewa and Mackinac counties are known as Meridian Road as well.\n\nIn the area of Ohio known as the Toledo Strip, the townships are numbered from the Michigan meridian and Michigan baseline because at the time they were surveyed, the area was considered to be a part of the Michigan Territory.\n\nA strip of land was given to Indiana when it became a state in 1816. Since this land had not been surveyed, the Indiana portion was surveyed with the rest of Indiana. However in Michigan, the southernmost tier of townships are truncated. The townships were surveyed and sections numbered as if they were in whole townships, except that the southernmost survey townships were only instead of the usual square (). Sections 19–24 in each township were chopped approximately in half, while sections 25–36 simply do not exist for these survey townships. To compensate for the smaller size, some of the civil townships formed from these survey townships were given additional sections of land from adjacent townships, as for example, White Pigeon Township in St. Joseph County and Three Oaks Township and New Buffalo Township in Berrien County. Some others of these smaller townships were merged into adjoining townships, as in Porter Township in Cass County. Similarly, many of the civil townships in Michigan along the Ohio border have somewhat more or less than the standard 36 square miles.\n\n\n"}

Heinrich was a pharmacist, but all the members of the family were musical. Heinz's brother Edgar (1898-1964) became a conductor, while sister Irmgard (1904-1995) became a well-known Milwaukee music teacher and radio broadcaster.\n\nRoemheld was a child prodigy who began playing the piano at the age of 4. He graduated from the Milwaukee College of Music at 19, and performed in theaters to earn money to study piano in Europe. In 1920, he went to Berlin, where he studied with Hugo Kaun, Ferruccio Busoni, and Egon Petri. While he was there, he appeared in concert with the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\nWhen he returned to America, Roemheld became involved in music for silent films, both as a pianist and as a conductor. In 1925, he was sent back to Berlin as head of Universal Pictures theaters there, but had to leave in 1929 due to the rise of Nazism.\n\nBack in America, Roemheld moved to Los Angeles and became a prominent cinema composer. He scored some scenes in \"Gone with the Wind\", including the burning of Atlanta, although he was not credited on-screen. In 1942, he won the Academy Award for Best Original Music Score for \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\". Among the more than 400 other films for which he composed music were \"Gentleman Jim\", \"The Lady From Shanghai\", \"The Invisible Man\", and \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\".\n\nAfter World War II, Roemheld once again returned to Germany to become Chief of the Film, Theatre, and Music Section of the Information Central Division of The American Armies in Europe. He continued writing for several major film studios until the late 1950s, and after briefly working in television, he retired in 1964 to concentrate on his classical composition.

This number is at most 2\"n\", since if 2\"n\" + 1 points are placed in the grid, then by the pigeonhole principle some row and some column will contain three points. The problem was introduced by Henry Dudeney in 1917.\n\nAlthough the problem can be solved with 2\"n\" points for every \"n\" up to 46, it is conjectured that fewer than 2\"n\" points are possible for sufficiently large values of \"n\". The best solutions that are known to work for arbitrarily large values of \"n\" place slightly fewer than 3\"n\"/2 points.\n\nPaul Erdős (in ) observed that, when \"n\" is a prime number, the set of \"n\" grid points (\"i\", \"i\" mod \"n\"), for 0 ≤ \"i\" < \"n\", contains no three collinear points. When \"n\" is not prime, one can perform this construction for a \"p\" × \"p\" grid contained in the \"n\" × \"n\" grid, where \"p\" is the largest prime that is at most \"n\". As a consequence, for any ε and any sufficiently large \"n\", one can place\npoints in the \"n\" × \"n\" grid with no three points collinear.\n\nErdős' bound has been improved subsequently: show that, when \"n\"/2 is prime, one can obtain a solution with 3(\"n\" - 2)/2 points by placing points on the hyperbola \"xy\" ≡ \"k\" (mod \"n\"/2), where \"k\" may be chosen arbitrarily as long as it is nonzero mod \"n\"/2. Again, for arbitrary \"n\" one can perform this construction for a prime near \"n\"/2 to obtain a solution with\npoints.\n\n conjectured that for large \"n\" one cannot do better than \"c n\" with\nwhich if corrected, results in\n\nThe Heilbronn triangle problem asks for the placement of \"n\" points in a unit square that maximizes the area of the smallest triangle formed by three of the points. By applying Erdős' construction of a set of grid points with no three collinear points, one can find a placement in which the smallest triangle has area\n\nNon-collinear sets of points in the three-dimensional grid were considered by . They proved that the maximum number of points in the \"n\" × \"n\" × \"n\" grid with no three points collinear is formula_6. \nSimilarly to Erdős's 2D construction, this can be accomplished by using points \n(\"x\", \"y\", \"x\" + \"y\") mod \"p\", where \"p\" is a prime congruent to 3 mod 4.\n\nAnother analogue in higher dimensions is to find sets of points that do not all lie in the same plane (or hyperplane). For the no-four-coplanar problem in three dimensions, it was reported by Ed Pegg, Oleg567 et al, that 8 such points can be selected in a 3x3x3 grid (exactly one solution up to rotation/reflection), 10 such points can be found for 4x4x4 (232 different solutions), and 13 such points can be found for 5x5x5 (38 different solutions). , it is not known what the maximal solution is for 6x6x6 grid, nor how many such solutions exist. Similar to the \"2n\" upper bound for the 2D case, there exists a \"3n\" upper bound for the 3D case (no more than 3 points per plane, and no more than \"n\" such planes in the grid), though as seen above, not all values of \"n\" attain the upper bound.\n\nThe cap set problem concerns a similar problem in high-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields.\n\nA noncollinear placement of \"n\" points can also be interpreted as a graph drawing of the complete graph in such a way that, although edges cross, no edge passes through a vertex. Erdős' construction above can be generalized to show that every \"n\"-vertex \"k\"-colorable graph has such a drawing in a \"O\"(\"n\") × \"O\"(\"k\") grid .\n\nOne can also consider graph drawings in the three-dimensional grid. Here the non-collinearity condition means that a vertex should not lie on a non-adjacent edge, but it is normal to work with the stronger requirement that no two edges cross (; ; ).\n\nFor \"n\" ≤ 46, it is known that 2\"n\" points may be placed with no three in a line. The numbers of solutions (not counting reflections and rotations as distinct) for small \"n\" = 2, 3, ..., are\n\n\n"}

She was the \"sunksqua\", or female sachem, of Pocasset tribe, which occupied contemporary Tiverton, Rhode Island in 1620.\n\nIn the Algonquian language of the Indigenous Peoples of the Northeastern United States and Canada, Weetamoo's name means \"speak to them\". She lived in Quequechan, now called Fall River, Massachusetts.\n\nWeetamoo was born in the Mattapoiset village of the Pokanoket or at Rhode Island's Taunton River area. She was known as a bead worker/quiller and dancer. Her father was Corbitant, sachem of the Pocasset tribe in present-day North Tiverton, Rhode Island, c. 1618–1630.\n\nBecause her father had no sons, she became \"sunksqua\", and was defended by an army of more than 300 men that she commanded. Being a woman did not diminish her authority, despite many colonists' lack of understanding of her position. It has been theorized that some of the lesser known sachems assumed to have been male may have been female sunksquas, especially since female leaders were not unheard of among the Algonquian tribes.\n\nIn her lifetime, she had five husbands. Her first husband, Chief Winnepurket, was the Sachem of Saugus, Massachusetts and died shortly after they were married. Wamsutta (alternatively known by the English as Alexander, a name which he retained until his death), her second husband, was the eldest son of Massasoit, grand sachem of the Wampanoag and participant in the first Thanksgiving with the Pilgrims. They were married in or before 1653, and [it is speculated that] she had one child with Wamsutta, although the date of birth and name are unknown. During their marriage, the tribe allied with the English against the Narragansett, though the English later broke their treaty with the tribe. Wamsutta became sick and died during negotiations with the English and his brother Metacom (Philip) succeeded him as Chief of the Wampanoag. Little is known about Weetamoo's third husband Quequequanachet, while she ended the marriage to her fourth husband Petonowit (called \"Ben\" by the English) when he sided with the English during King Philip's War. Her final marriage was to Quinnapin, the son of Niantic Narraganset sachem Ninigrat and grandson of powerful Narragansett sachem Canonchet. He was described as \"a handsome warrior\" and they were married in September or August 1675. This marriage was designed to strengthen and reinforce the Wampanoag-Narragansett alliance against colonists. The marriage appeared to have been strong and the pair had at least one child together, who died in 1676. Quinnapin was captured in 1676.\n\nWeetamoo joined \"with King Philip in fighting the colonists\" in 1675, in King Philip's War, also known as \"Metacomet's Rebellion.\" King Philip's War is named for the uprising of Metacomet, Weetamoo's brother in law and the younger brother of Wamsutta, who was also known by the English name Philip. Early on in the war, Weetamoo gave support to Metacomet by aiding his forces with the strength of her soldiers. Eventually, the English defeated the Wampanoag in August 1676. Weetamoo drowned in the Taunton River trying to escape. Her dead body was mutilated, and her head was displayed on a pole in Taunton, MA. Little else is known about her final days or death, or of the deaths of her soldiers who traveled with her. The story of her corpse being beheaded comes from the writings of minister Increase Mather.\n\nWeetamoo/Wattimore appears in Mary Rowlandson's \"The Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson.\" In 1676, Weetamoo and her relative Quinnapin, the \"sachem\" of Narragansett, attacked a colonial settlement in Lancaster, Massachusetts. Rowlandson, who was captured and held by Quinnapin for three months, left a vivid description of Weetamoo's appearance as well as personality:\n\nA severe and proud dame she was, bestowing every day in dressing herself neat as much time as any of the gentry of the land: powdering her hair, and painting her face, going with necklaces, with jewels in her ears, and bracelets upon her hands. When she had dressed herself, her work was to make girdles of wampum and beads.\n\nOnly women of rank were allowed to produce \"Girdles of wampom and beads\", and Weetamoo's production of these items reinforced her status. Wampum belts would be strung together with shells and were often used among Native Americans to deliver messages accompanied by speeches. Many places in the White Mountains of New Hampshire are also named after her, such as Weetamoo Falls, Mount Weetamoo, the Weetamoo Trail (which includes Weetamoo Glen and Weetamoo Rock), and the Six Husbands Trail, a reference to her marriages. However, there is no evidence that Weetamoo ever went to the White Mountains, and the area's focus on her may come from John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \"The Bridal of Penacook,\" which names her as being from the area.\n\nWeetamoo's adolescent life is depicted in the young adult historical novel, \"Weetamoo: Heart of the Pocasetts\", in \"The Royal Diaries\" series\n\nWeetamoo Woods Open Space in Tiverton, Rhode Island is named after Weetamoo. A 50-foot vessel, \"Weetamoo\", built in 1902, \"was named after the daughter of an Indian Chief in John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \"Bride of Penacook\".\" The vessel served on Lake Sunapee for 25 years before being scuttled.

It lies on the Denmark Strait, facing the east coast of Greenland. It is connected to the rest of Iceland by a 7-km-wide isthmus between Gilsfjörður and Bitrufjörður. The Westfjords are very mountainous; the coastline is heavily indented by dozens of fjords surrounded by steep hills. These indentations make roads very circuitous and communications by land difficult. In addition many of the roads are closed by ice and snow for several months of the year. The Vestfjarðagöng road tunnel from 1996 has improved that situation. The cliffs at Látrabjarg comprise the longest bird cliff in the northern Atlantic Ocean and are at the westernmost point in Iceland. The Drangajökull glacier is located in the north of the peninsula and is the fifth-largest of the country, but the only glacier of the region.\n\nThe lack of flat lowlands in the area limits the potential for agriculture, which is mostly restricted to low-intensity sheep grazing near the fjords. Good natural harbors in many of the fjords and their proximity to fishing areas are vital for the local economy. The Westfjords are very sparsely populated: the total population in 2020 was 7,115. The district capital and by far the largest settlement is Ísafjörður (population around 4000).\n\n\nThe box is for Goltur, at the tip of the peninsula 20 km (12 mi) northwest of Ísafjörður. Westfjords is generally the coldest area at sea level in Iceland, because of the East Greenland Current.\n\nIn 1615, 32 shipwrecked Basque whalers were killed by locals, after which the magistrate made it law that any Basque person seen in the region should be instantly killed.

{"id": "2252625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252625", "title": "Shut Your Mouth (song)", "text": "Shut Your Mouth (song)\n\n\"Shut Your Mouth\" is a 2001 alternative rock song by Garbage, written and recorded for their third studio album \"Beautiful Garbage\". \"Shut Your Mouth\" was the album opener; it was also released as its fourth and final single.\n\n\"Shut Your Mouth\" was written and recorded at Garbage's own Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin during the year-long sessions that culminated in their third album \"Beautiful Garbage\". \"Shut Your Mouth\" was one of the first songs Garbage completed; the genesis of the song came from the band setting up their instruments and playing music for three hours, while Manson spontaneously sang. \"It came from Garbage attempting to do a funk jam,\" Butch Vig recalled, \"and then Shirley went into the vocal booth and this Patti Smith-style stream-of-consciousness vocal came out\". Vig later described \"Shut Your Mouth\" as \"Sly & The Family Stone on quaaludes. Lyrically, Shirley Manson explained, \"In a general sense, it's about keeping your own counsel. There are so many opinions out there and misinformation and everybody's got their own agenda\".\n\nThe band created a wah-wah guitar sound for the intro of \"Shut Your Mouth\" by recording a 1955 Les Paul Junior through an old DigiTech Whammy pedal into a Matchless Hurricane/Marshall amplifier 4x12 setup. Session musician Daniel Shulman worked on \"Shut Your Mouth\" during the first of his two visits to Smart Studios to work on the album. He quickly laid down a riff for the chorus which used a lot of common tones throughout the chord progressions of the song. However, Shulman spent a long time working on a \"funky and busy\" part for the verses. All the bass guitar parts on \"Shut Your Mouth\" were performed on a Music Man Sabre bass. Butch Vig recorded a funk jam for the middle of the song on a Drum Workshop kit; he then cut and pasted random beats using Pro Tools editing software to create a jarring percussive effect. \"It was just sort of a straight pattern, and without even listening to it I started dropping beats in other spots. Then I just ran through that section, and it was pretty messed up. But it had a much more interesting... it's more of a breakdown section,\" Vig recalled, \"I actually tried notating the recorded version, and it was like some insane piece of music.\" Vig used a thirty-year-old Roger Meyer limiter to saturate the drum sounds on \"Shut Your Mouth\" (\"...to make them sound thrashy\").\n\nThe majority of the recorded work on \"Beautiful Garbage\" was to analog tracked through a Trident A Range mixing console; then fed into Pro Tools for recording overdubs, editing and mixing. The band's engineer, Billy Bush would then print a stereo mix of the Pro Tools tracks to two-inch tape and then add more overdubs to it. As a whole on \"Beautiful Garbage\", Manson's main vocals were generally not treated to the extent that they had on Garbage's first two albums; however her vocal on \"Shut Your Mouth\" was: the band subjected her takes to a number of Pro Tools plug-ins such as GRM Tools' \"Band Pass\" and Wave Mechanics' \"Soundblender\".\n\nOn October 10, 2001, \"Shut Your Mouth\" was debuted live by Garbage in Notre Dame, Indiana, during the band's first support slot on U2's Elevation Tour. The song was performed at almost every show on the Beautiful Garbage tour; at one Osaka, Japan performance in February 2002, Garbage replaced the verse riff with one from AC/DC's \"Back in Black\". \n\nIn 2007, \"Shut Your Mouth\" was remastered and included on Garbage's greatest hits album \"Absolute Garbage\".\n\nOn April 8, 2002, \"Shut Your Mouth\" was announced as the fourth single from \"Beautiful Garbage\" by Shirley Manson herself, during a Garbage concert broadcast live throughout Europe on MTV. The band had already pre-empted active single promotion by recording both \"Shut Your Mouth\" and a cover of Rolling Stones' 1971 single \"Wild Horses\" for \"\", a new BBC Choice music show where contemporary artists performed their new single and an old classic. The show was scheduled to air in June, when Mushroom Records UK had planned to release \"Shut Your Mouth\" across Europe to coincide with Garbage's booked Glastonbury performance and European tour. After the failure of third album single, \"Breaking Up the Girl\", and despite promotional discs already having been distributed, Mushroom cancelled the UK's June release date of \"Shut Your Mouth\".\n\nPIAS Recordings released \"Shut Your Mouth\" in Germany on June 24 to coincide with the band's German tour dates. The single was released a CD maxi featuring b-side \"Happiness Pt.2\" and two live tracks: \"Wild Horses\" and \"Only Happy When it Rains\". Garbage made their first live appearance on a German television show on June 24, performing \"Shut Your Mouth\" on \"TV total\", while the animated music video for \"Shut Your Mouth\" had begun airing on MTV networks from June 18. PIAS then issued the single in other European territories from July 8.\n\nGarbage regrouped at the end of August 2002 to actively promote \"Shut Your Mouth\" in the UK with two club dates at London's Electric Ballroom (which were filmed for BBC documentary series \"Roadies\"); the band performed the single on August 27 at that year's \"Kerrang! Awards\", and completed two pre-records for both \"Top Of The Pops\" and \"Popworld\" to be broadcast nearer the release date. Manson also appeared on breakfast show \"\" to discuss the song, while Mushroom ran print ads for the single in \"Kerrang!\" and \"NME\" music magazines. Rejecting the artwork used for the single in Europe, Mushroom commissioned a new photoshoot so that the single cover would feature Manson's image (this was a first for Garbage, who had never appeared on the covers of their singles or albums before). Mushroom also commissioned new remixes and a live music video for the UK release; the video debuting online and on Kerrang! TV on September 16.\n\nMushroom Records finally released \"Shut Your Mouth\" in the UK on September 23; the single was marketed as a three CD single set, each in card sleeves, with a card wallet with the first disc to store the whole set. Each disc was strictly limited to 5,000 copies. Spread across the formats were three new b-sides exclusive to the UK release of \"Shut Your Mouth\", Garbage having written and recorded them in Montreux, Switzerland while touring Europe, two new remixes of \"Shut Your Mouth\", and on the third disc, their live recording of \"Wild Horses\". This last disc was released in conjunction with Blaze Television and BBC Worldwide, due to the licensing arrangements made by the BBC to feature \"Wild Horses\" on \"Re:Covered\" earlier that year. On September 29, \"Shut Your Mouth\" charted at #20. This position was the highest reached by any of the four \"Beautiful Garbage\" singles on the UK Singles Chart. The following week, \"Shut Your Mouth\" dropped out of the Top 75; this was the first instance in the fifty-year history of the UK Singles Chart where a Top Twenty track did so.\n\nFMR released \"Shut Your Mouth\" in Australia on September 2 in its original format configuration; a single CD maxi featuring the same b-sides and live tracks as in the European release; pre-empting an Australian Tour Edition re-release of the \"Beautiful Garbage\" on September 16. \"Shut Your Mouth\" peaked at #74 on the ARIA Singles chart, spending three weeks within the top 100. Garbage's world tour returned to Australia the following month; on October 8, the band performed \"Shut Your Mouth\" on talk show \"Rove\".\n\nIn October 2002, Garbage returned to perform a co-headlining tour of North America with No Doubt and The Distillers. Although Interscope chose not to service any further singles from \"Beautiful Garbage\" in the United States, Universal Music Canada sent promotional discs of \"Shut Your Mouth\" to alternative rock stations across the country. Vancouver radio station 99.3 The Fox had been playing \"Shut Your Mouth\" since the release of \"Beautiful Garbage\" a year earlier. Interscope, however, licensed \"Shut Your Mouth\" to the soundtrack of the PlayStation racing game \"World Rally Championship\".\n\n\"Shut Your Mouth\" was retained in Garbage's live set for 2005's Bleed Like Me tour, 2012-13's Not Your Kind Of People World Tour and 2016's Strange Little Birds tour. Along with \"Cherry Lips\", it was one of the only two tracks from \"Beautiful Garbage\" to be performed on all three tours. In August 2005, Garbage teamed up with Canadian electroclash musician Peaches to perform at \"AmsterJAM\", a mash-up rock festival held at Randall's Island, NY. \"Shut Your Mouth\" was performed by both artists mixed with Peaches' single \"Shake Yer Dix\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Two music videos were completed for \"Shut Your Mouth\". The first was a stiff 2D/3D animated promo, directed by Henry Moore Selder across May/June 2002. Garbage approached Selder to direct the video after being impressed with his videos for The Hives (\"Die, Alright!\" and \"Hate to Say I Told You So\"). The video concept is Manson's plea to the press to stop meddling in her private life, interpreted by her featuring as a guest on a \"Letterman/Springer\"-style talk show. The square characters are meant to look 'anti-3D'; achieved by removing the smoothness and perfection in the software, to give a jerky and organic look. Hand-drawn images of the band were then mixed in.\n\nFour people, including Selder, from production company RealA worked on the video for a month. After the video was first broadcast online, the video was re-edited to suit the band. Marker, particularly, did not like his animation. The second edit, where Marker was redesigned with a \"Terminator\"-style look, was broadcast across Europe from July 5.\n\nNeither Garbage nor Mushroom Records were pleased with the animated video, and commissioned a second video for the singles UK release. With a small £10,000 budget for the video, it was decided a live video would be released, but the label offered a few up and coming directors the chance to remix some footage or give it a different spin. Existing live footage filmed by MTV in London and by WDR in Cologne filmed at two shows in April 2002 was used to create an initial live cut.\n\nThe concept behind the \"Bloomberg\"-style data screens was to use them as a platform to show the footage in an unusual format and to illustrate ideas within the songs lyrics with animation. The idea came from the production team seeing a large LCD display outside Waterloo station, the image shown became distorted when viewed up close. A number of shots were re-played through a 20-foot video wall in a Portsmouth warehouse and filmed on digibeta for the distorted effect. This footage was combined in the final edit of the video, which was completed in August 2002 and screened a few days after.\n\nBoth versions of the \"Shut Your Mouth\" video were made commercially available in QuickTime format on both the enhanced CD singles of the \"Shut Your Mouth\" UK release. A remastered version of the Live Version of the \"Shut Your Mouth\" video was included on Garbage's 2007 greatest hits DVD \"Absolute Garbage\", and made available as a digital download via online music services the same year.\n\nMushroom commissioned multiple remixes of \"Shut Your Mouth\" for the UK single release: an rework from Italian producers Francesco de Bellis & Mario Pierro, known as Jolly Music, and a rock-led arrangement by Jagz Kooner, formerly of The Sabres of Paradise were included on the CD single sets. A further remix produced by Ken Reay was included on a white label 12\" release distributed for club play. Garbage's tour/session drummer Matt Walker also made his own \"Shut Your Mouth\" remix, which he uploaded to YouTube in 2013.\n\nThe CD format of \"Beautiful Garbage\" contained an enhanced element where users could remix four tracks from the album, of which \"Shut Your Mouth\" was one of. Created in conjunction with Sonic Foundry, using a customized version of their drag-and-drop \"ACID Pro\" music sequencer software, the remixes utilized samples and loops cut from the track masters. The enhanced section could be accessed when the user was online; a simplified version of the software featuring only \"Androgyny\" loops was accessible when the user was offline.\n\n\"Shut Your Mouth\" received a mostly positive reception from music critics upon the release of \"Beautiful Garbage\". In a review for \"Q\", Ian Griffiths wrote \"Arch opener \"Shut Your Mouth\" is a bile-laden winner from the same school as \"Stupid Girl\" while in her review for \"Rock Sound\", Victoria Durham commented on the tracks \"bombastic sass\". In Peter Murphy's album preview for \"Hot Press\", he wrote, \"In an album of hot colours and dark corners, \"Shut Your Mouth\" is designer dirty-in-your-ear funk with free-flowing lyrics and what sound like purloined AC/DC riffs.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2252626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252626", "title": "Páramo", "text": "Páramo\n\nPáramo can refer to a variety of alpine tundra ecosystems. Some ecologists describe the páramo broadly as \"all high, tropical, montane vegetation above the continuous timberline\". A more narrow term classifies the páramo according to its regional placement in the northern Andes of South America and adjacent southern Central America. The páramo is the ecosystem of the regions above the continuous forest line, yet below the permanent snowline. It is a \"Neotropical high mountain biome with a vegetation composed mainly of giant rosette plants, shrubs and grasses\". According to scientists, páramos may be \"evolutionary hot spots\" and among the fastest evolving regions on Earth.\n\nThe Northern Andean Paramo global ecoregion includes the Cordillera Central páramo (Ecuador, Peru), Santa Marta páramo (Colombia), Cordillera de Merida páramo (Venezuela) and Northern Andean páramo (Colombia, Ecuador) terrestrial ecoregions.\nThe Costa Rican páramo in Costa Rica and Panama is another páramo ecoregion.\nIn the strictest sense of the term, all páramo ecosystems are located in the Neotropics, specifically South and Central America. Scattered throughout the regions between 11°N and 8°S latitudes, these ecosystems are located mainly in the northwest corner of South America, in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.\n\nIn Venezuela, the páramo occurs in the Cordillera de Mérida. Páramo ecosystems are also found in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia, and in the regions of Huehuetenango and El Quiché of Guatemala in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. The Cordillera de Talamanca of Costa Rica and the westernmost part of Panama has páramo. In northern Ecuador, the Guandera Biological Station is a fairly undisturbed páramo ecosystem.\n\nThe majority of the páramo ecosystems occur in the Colombian Andes. The Sumapaz Páramo, south of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes (about south of Bogotá), is the largest páramo in the world. This region was declared a National Park of Colombia in 1977 because of its importance as a biodiversity hotspot and main source of water for the most densely populated area of the country, the Bogotá Savannah.\nThe Páramo Wildlife Refuge Park in the San José Province of Costa Rica \"protects tropical forest areas in the high elevations of the Talamanca Mountains\".\n\nCotopaxi National Park contains of protected land in the Cotopaxi Province of Ecuador. Much of this park is páramo. Its flora includes gentians, clubmosses, valerians, and asters such as \"Loricaria\" and \"Chuquiraga\" species.\n\nPáramo climates differ slightly depending on the specific location. In Colombia and northern Ecuador, air masses from the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) have a substantial effect on the climate, and these regions tend to be consistently humid (approx. 70-85%) throughout the year. The Andes also play a key role in the climate of these regions as they cause an orographic uplift in which moist air rises. This creates continuous moisture via rain, clouds, and fog, with many of them receiving over of rain annually.\n\nThe páramos of the northern-most Andes of Venezuela, northern Colombia, and Costa Rica experience a different climate due to the dry season, which is caused by northeasterly trade winds. Southern Ecuador and northern Peru experience the most severe dryness as they are influenced by an air mass from the Amazon Basin, which releases its moisture on the eastern slopes, as well as another air mass from the west that is influenced by the Humboldt Current.\n\nOverall, páramo climates are known for their daily fluctuations in temperature and humidity. While they are generally cold and humid ecosystems, they often undergo a sudden and drastic change in weather in which they fluctuate between temperatures from below freezing to as high as . This oscillation often results in a daily freeze-and-thaw cycle, sometimes described as \"summer every day and winter every night.\" Mean annual temperatures of páramo ecosystems range from to , with increasingly colder temperatures at higher latitudes.\n\nSoils in páramo ecosystems vary, but most are young and partially weathered. The soil has a relatively low pH because of an abundance of moisture and organic content. Organic content, even within disturbed sites averages very high which contributes to water retention in the soil. During cold and wet weather, there are few nutrients available and productivity is very low in páramo soils. Soils in páramo ecosystems have changed because of human activity, especially due to burning vegetation to clear land for grazing.\n\nSoils in the south Ecuadorian páramo are characterized broadly into Andisols, Inceptisols, Histosols, Entisols, and Mollisols. Recently, there has been an increase in Andisol soils, largely due to more volcanic activity These soils have a very high water retention rate, which contributes to the rise in cultivation and differential land use. This water supply stored in the soil in the higher elevation páramo in the Andes becomes the water supply for Andean settlements in lower altitudes.\nPáramos are divided into separate zones based on altitude and vegetation structure, with the three main types of páramo vegetation unequally distributed throughout the different zones. \nSuperpáramo is at the highest elevation and is usually considered to be the transition zone between the higher, permanent snow region and the lower grass páramo zone. The superpáramo zone is generally narrow and exists atop loose stones and sandy soils at about . It has the lowest air temperature, precipitation level, soil water-holding capacity, and nutrient content of all the zones. Being the highest in altitude, it also has the highest levels of solar radiation and night frost. For this reason, vegetation in the superpáramo must be highly resistant to such severe fluctuations in weather. Air temperatures are low - cold at night and cool during the day with daily oscillations greater than the oscillations of monthly averages. Due to its localization on high mountains, this area is the least disturbed by humans and contains the most endemic species of all the zones. Flora includes \"Azorella pedunculata\" of the family Apiaceae and species from the families Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Ericaceae.\nThe most broadly described zone is the grass páramo. Grass páramos cover large areas of mountain ranges, while others are limited to small areas on slopes and summits of very high mountains. The term \"páramo\" is sometimes used to refer to this specific type. It has continuous vegetation and plant cover with a \"yellowish to olive–brown\" look due to the combination of dead and living grasses. The grass páramo extends from approximately , and is composed of mostly tussock-grasses and bunch-grasses. \"Calamagrostis intermedia\" and other grasses of the genera \"Calamagrostis\" and \"Festuca\" tend to dominate this zone. Other common vegetation includes large and small shrubs, stunted trees, cushion plants, herbs, and rosette plants. While these are the dominant species, grass páramos can also contain tall- and short-grass communities, including herbaceous and woody vegetation. Due to its easier access and high levels of grass, this zone is more impacted by humans and suffers from both burning and grazing activities.\n\nSubpáramo is the lowest and most diverse zone. At , it is a shrub-dominated zone that combines aspects of both the grass páramo above and the forest below. Along with shrubs, this zone also contains small, scattered trees which gradually transition into the grasses and herbs of the grass páramo above. Plant communities in this vegetation zone are also known to include thickets that are mainly composed of shrubby or woody vegetation, including species from the genera \"Ilex\", \"Ageratina\", and \"Baccharis\". Fragmented forests can appear in the subpáramo due to microclimatic or edaphic conditions, yet the more abrupt changes are generally due to anthropogenic disruption such as cutting, burning, and grazing activities. Because of these high levels of disruption, it is believed that subpáramos are made up of largely secondary-growth communities. The high levels of disruption also make this zone particularly difficult to define, as humans typically extend and expand the zone for their own purposes, sometimes over hundreds or thousands of years. This has altered forest lines, often lowering them by several hundred meters, which has also affected the zoning habitats for many animals.\n\nThe vegetation of the páramo provides shelter and habitat for a variety of mammals, birds, insects, amphibians, and reptiles. Some animals commonly found in páramo ecosystems include the Culpeo (sometimes called the páramo wolf), the white-tailed deer, and the spectacled bear which occasionally forages in the high páramo for its favored food, \"Puya\" bromeliads. Invertebrates such as grasshoppers, cockroaches, beetles, and flies are found in the subpáramo. Amphibians have been well documented in páramo ecosystems, including salamanders such as \"Bolitoglossa\" species and frogs such as \"Pristimantis\" and \"Atelopus\" species. Reptiles include lizards of the genera \"Stenocercus\", \"Phenacosaurus\", and \"Proctoporus\".\nSixty-nine species of birds are considered to be \"total users\" of páramo habitats, with \"41 species making it their primary habitat and 16 as indicator species\". The Andean condor, also called \"king of the Andes\", is known for its wide wingspan, but is no longer frequently seen. The most numerous bird families in the páramo include eagles, hummingbirds, ovenbirds, thraupid \"finches\", and tyrant flycatchers. Some hummingbirds tolerate the cold climate by going into \"a kind of nightly hibernation.\"\n\nHummingbirds, bees and flies are all important pollinators in the páramo, while birds and smaller mammals such as rabbits and guinea pigs are important seed dispersers. Many of the larger mammals of the páramo are rare due to hunting.\n\nHumans have inhabited the páramo of the Andes for approximately the past 15,000 years. Deforestation has been extensive and in some cases, like the northern Andes, 90-95% of forests have been cleared. Other sites in Venezuela and Colombia show evidence that humans settled there at least 800 years ago and used the land for agriculture and hunting.\nWhen Europeans came to the Americas they introduced exotic plants and animals that greatly affected the land, especially cattle, which were introduced to the páramos in the early 18th century. By the 20th century the growing population of settlers led to an increased demand for land, and páramo ecosystems suffered accordingly. As more land was needed for cattle, fire was used to clear land, and eventually páramos became excessively burned and overgrazed. Both burning and grazing have damaged vegetation, soils, species diversity, and water storage capacity of the páramos. In burned and disturbed sites that were studied in the Andes the pH and phosphorus concentration in the soil are higher than in non-burned sites.\nClimate change is becoming an increasingly pressing issue for páramo ecosystems.\nGrowing populations in Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador have forced settlements in higher elevations covering more páramo. Recent developments such as construction of aqueducts, drainage systems, and roads, mining, and afforestation have been a huge additional páramo disturbance. Increases in temperature extremes are forcing many fauna and flora species to higher grounds, and eventually they could face extinction. The flora of páramos is adapted to specific conditions and is thus vulnerable to even small climatic change. Climate change in the Andes is causing glaciers in the páramo to disappear and a drop in rainfall, virtually drying up páramo and in turn, drying up the water supply for cities such as Quito, Ecuador and Bogotá, Colombia.\n\nOn 8 February 2016, the Constitutional Court of Colombia banned all mining operations in the paramos, prioritising the protection of the environment, and terminating 347 mining licenses that had operational rights in the ecosystem.\n\n"}

It is a form of spirantization and is commonly the final phase of palatalization.\n\nA characteristic of Mashreqi varieties of Arabic (particularly Levantine and Egyptian) is to assibilate the interdental consonants of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in certain contexts (defined more culturally than phonotactically). Thus, , pronounced in MSA, becomes (as MSA → Levantine \"culture\"); , pronounced in MSA, becomes (as MSA → Levantine \"guilt\"); and , pronounced in MSA, becomes (as MSA → Levantine \"lucky\").\n\nDiachronically, the phoneme represented by the letter has in, some dialects, experienced assibilation as well. The pronunciation in Classical Arabic is reconstructed to have been or (or perhaps both dialectically); it is cognate to in most other Semitic languages, and it is understood to be derived from that sound in Proto-Semitic. It has experienced extensive change in pronunciation over the centuries, and is pronounced at least six different ways across the assorted varieties of Arabic. A common one is , the end result of a process of palatalization starting with Proto-West Semitic , then or , then (a pronunciation still current) and finally (in Levantine and non-Algerian Maghrebi). The last pronunciation is considered acceptable for use in MSA, along with and .\n\nIn the history of several Bantu groups, including the Southern Bantu languages, the Proto-Bantu consonant \"*k\" was palatalised before a close or near-close vowel. Thus, the class 7 noun prefix \"*kɪ̀-\" appears in e.g. Zulu as \"isi-\", Sotho as se-\", Venda as tshi-\" and Shona as \"chi-\".\n\nFinnic languages (Finnish, Estonian and their closest relatives) had changed to . The alternation can be seen in dialectal and inflected word forms: Finnish \"to deny\" → ~ \"s/he denied\"; \"water\" vs. \"as water\".\n\nAn intermediate stage is preserved in South Estonian in certain cases: \"tsiga\" \"pig\", vs. Finnish , Standard (North) Estonian .\n\nIn the High German consonant shift, voiceless stops spirantized to at the end of a syllable. The shift of to (as in English \"water\", German ) is assibilation.\n\nAssibilation occurs without palatalization for some speakers of African American Vernacular English in which is alveolarized to when it occurs at the end of a syllable and within a word before another consonant, leading to such pronunciations as the following:\n\nIn Proto-Greek, the earlier combinations \"*ty\", \"*ty\" and \"*dy\" assibilated to become alveolar affricates, \"*ts\" and \"*dz\", in what's known as the first palatalization. Later, a second round of palatalization occurred, initially producing geminate palatal \"*ťť\" and \"*ďď\" from various consonants followed by \"*y\". The former was depalatalised to plain geminate \"tt\" in some dialects, and assibilated to \"ss\" in others. The latter evolved into an affricate \"dz\" in all Greek dialects. Some examples:\n\n\nSome Greek dialects later underwent yet another round of assibilation. shifted to finally in Attic and Ionic, but not in Doric.\n\nThe word \"assibilation\" itself contains an example of the phenomenon, as it is pronounced . The Classical Latin was pronounced (for example, was pronounced and ). However, in Vulgar Latin, it assibilated to , which can still be seen in Italian: .\n\nIn French, lenition then gave (like )., which was further palatalized in the English derived words to (like \"attention\" ).\n\nMost dialects of Quebec French apply a more recent assibilation to all dental plosive consonants immediately before high front vowels and associated semivowels, so that the sequences become pronounced respectively.\n\nAssibilation can occur in some varieties of Spanish such as in Ecuador and Mexico. It is closely related to the phonetic term \"sibilation\".\n\nPalatalization effects were widespread in the history of Proto-Slavic. In the first palatalization, various consonants were converted into postalveolar fricatives and affricates, while in the second and third palatalizations, the results were alveolar.\n\nSome Slavic languages underwent yet another round of palatalisation. In Polish, in particular, dental consonants became alveolo-palatal fricatives and affricates when followed by a front vowel.\n\n"}

{"id": "2252691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252691", "title": "Dorudon", "text": "Dorudon\n\nDorudon (\"spear-tooth\") is a genus of extinct basilosaurid ancient whales that lived alongside \"Basilosaurus\" 40.4 to 33.9 million years ago in the Eocene. They were about long and fed on small fish and mollusks. \"Dorudon\" lived in warm seas around the world. Fossils have been found along the former shorelines of the Tethys Sea in present-day Egypt and Pakistan, as well as in the United States, New Zealand, and Western Sahara.\n\n described \"Dorudon serratus\" based on a fragmentary maxilla and a few teeth found in South Carolina. He concluded that the teeth must have belonged to a mammal since they were two-rooted, that they must have been teeth from a juvenile since they were hollow, and also noted their similarity to the teeth then described for \"Zeuglodon\" (=\"Basilosaurus\"). When exploring the type locality, Gibbes discovered a lower jaw and twelve caudal vertebrae, which he felt obliged to assign to \"Zeuglodon\" together with his original material. Gibbes concluded that \"Dorudon\" were juvenile \"Zeuglodon\" and consequently withdrew his new genus. He did however allow Louis Agassiz at Harvard to examine his specimens, and the Swiss professor replied that these were neither teeth of a juvenile nor those of \"Zeuglodon\", but of a separate genus just as Gibbes had first proposed.\n\nThe current taxonomic status of \"Dorudon\" is based on 's revision of \"Dorudon\" and detailed description of \"D. atrox\". Before this, the taxonomy of \"Dorudon\" was in disarray and based on a limited set of specimens.\n\n\"D. atrox\" is known from Egypt, \"D. serratus\" from Georgia and South Carolina in the United States. The type species \"D. serratus\" was, and still is, based solely on two partial maxillae with a few teeth, cranial fragments, and a dozen vertebrae with some additional material, collected but not described by Gibbes, and referred to the type species. Before Uhen 2004, \"D. atrox\" was based solely on Andrews holotype skull, lower jaw, and the vertebrae he referred to it, but is now the best known archaeocete species.\n\nThe two species of \"Dorudon\" differ from other members of Dorudontinae mainly in size: they are considerably larger than \"Saghacetus\" and slightly larger than \"Zygorhiza\", but also differ from both these genera in dental and/or cranial morphology. The limited known material for \"D. serratus\" makes it difficult to compare the two species of \"Dorudon\". placed \"D. atrox\" in the same genus as \"D. serratus\" because of similarities in size and morphology, but kept them as separate species because of differences in dental morphology. Even-though \"D. serratus\" is the type species, the description of \"Dorudon\" is largely based on \"D. atrox\" because of its completeness. The cranial morphology of \"D. atrox\" makes it distinct from all other archaeocetes.\n\nDorudontines were originally believed to be juvenile individuals of \"Basilosaurus\" as their fossils are similar but smaller. They have since been shown to be a different genus with the discovery of \"Dorudon\" juveniles. Although they look very much like modern whales, basilosaurines and dorudontines lacked the 'melon organ' that allows their descendants to use echolocation as effectively as modern whales. Like other basilosaurids, their nostrils were midway from the snout to the top of the head.\nThe \"Dorudon\" calves may have fallen prey to hungry \"Basilosaurus\", as shown by unhealed bite marks on the skulls of some juvenile \"Dorudon\".\n\nThe dental formula for \"Dorudon atrox\" is .\nTypical for cetaceans, the upper incisors are aligned with the cheek teeth, and, except the small I, separated by large diastemata containing pits into which the lower incisors fit. The upper incisors are simple conical teeth with a single root, lacking accessory denticles, and difficult to distinguish from lower incisors. The upper incisors are missing in most specimens and are only known from two specimens. The upper canine is a little larger than the upper incisors, and, like them, directed slightly buccally and mesially.\n\nP, only preserved in a single specimen, is the only single-rooted upper premolar. Apparently, P is conical, smaller than the remaining premolars and lacks accessory denticles. P is the largest upper tooth and the first in the upper row with large accessory denticles. Like the more posterior premolars, it is buccolingually compressed and double-rooted. It has a dominant central protocone flanked by denticles that decrease in size mesially and distally, resulting in a tooth with a triangular profile. P is similar to but slightly smaller than P, except that it has a projection on the lingual side which is the remnant of a third root. In P, smaller than P, the larger distal root is formed by the fusion of two roots.\n\nThe upper molars extend onto the zygomatic arch and are considerably smaller than their neighbouring premolars. Like P, their distal root is wider than the mesial and formed by the fusion of two roots. The profiles of the molars are more rounded than those of the premolars.\nSimilar to the upper incisors, the lower incisors are simple conical teeth curved distally and aligned with the cheek teeth. I, the smallest tooth, is sitting on the anteriormost portion of the dentary, with its alveolus left open towards the mandibular symphysis and located as close to the alveolus of I as it can. I, I, and C are very similar, considerably larger than I.\n\nThe lower premolars are double-rooted, buccolingually compressed teeth, except the deciduous P which is single-rooted. P is the second largest cheek tooth, P the largest; both are very similar, dominated by the central cusp.\n\nIn the lower molars the accessory denticles on the mesial edges are replaced by a deep groove called the reentrant groove. The apical cusp is the primitive protoconid. M and M are morphologically very similar. M is sitting high on the ascending mandibular ramus.\n\n\n"}

It culminated during the Stalin era, then declined, but it continued to exist during the \"Khrushchev Thaw\", followed by increased persecution of Soviet dissidents during the Brezhnev stagnation, and it did not cease to exist until late in Mikhail Gorbachev's rule when it was ended in keeping with his policies of glasnost and perestroika.\n\nSecret police had a long history in Russia. Ivan the Terrible used the Oprichina, while more recently the Third Section and Okrhana.\n\nEarly on, the Leninist view of the class conflict and the resulting notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat provided the theoretical basis of the repressions. Its legal basis was formalized into the Article 58 in the code of Russian SFSR and similar articles for other Soviet republics.\n\nAt times, the repressed were called the enemies of the people. Punishments by the state included summary executions, sending innocent people to Gulag, forced resettlement, and stripping of citizen's rights. At certain times, all members of a family, including children, were punished as \"traitor of the Motherland family-members\". Repression was conducted by the Cheka and its successors, and other state organs. Periods of the increased repression include Red Terror, Collectivisation, the Great Purges, the Doctor's Plot, and others. The secret-police forces conducted massacres of prisoners on numerous occasions. Repression took place in the Soviet republics and in the territories occupied by the Soviet Army during World War II, including the Baltic States and Eastern Europe..\n\nState repression led to incidents of resistance, such as the Tambov rebellion (1920–1921), the Kronstadt rebellion (1921), and the Vorkuta Uprising (1953); the Soviet authorities suppressed such resistance with overwhelming military force. During the Tambov rebellion Tukhachevsky (chief Red Army commander in the area) allegedly authorized Bolshevik military forces to use chemical weapons against villages with civilian population and rebels. (According to witnesses' accounts, chemical weapons were never actually used.) Prominent citizens of villages were often taken as hostages and executed if the resistance fighters did not surrender.\n\nRed Terror in Soviet Russia was the campaign of mass arrests and executions conducted by the Bolshevik government. The Red Terror was officially announced on September 2, 1918 by Yakov Sverdlov and ended in about October 1918. However Sergei Melgunov applies this term to repressions for the whole period of the Russian Civil War, 1918–1922. Estimates for the total number of people executed during the initial phase Red Terror are at least 10,000, with roughly 28,000 executed per year between December 1917 and February 1922. Estimates for the total number of lives lost during this period range from 100,000 to 200,000.\n\nCollectivization in the Soviet Union was a policy, pursued between 1928 and 1933, to consolidate individual land and labour into collective farms (, \"kolkhoz\", plural \"kolkhozy\"). The Soviet leaders were confident that the replacement of individual peasant farms by kolkhozy would immediately increase food supplies for the urban population, the supply of raw materials for processing industry, and agricultural exports generally. Collectivization was thus regarded as the solution to the crisis in agricultural distribution (mainly in grain deliveries) that had developed since 1927 and was becoming more acute as the Soviet Union pressed ahead with its ambitious industrialization program. As the peasantry, with the exception of the poorest part, resisted the collectivization policy, the Soviet government resorted to harsh measures to force the farmers to collectivize. In his conversation with Winston Churchill Stalin gave his estimate of the number of \"kulaks\" who were repressed for resisting Soviet collectivization as 10 million, including those forcibly deported. Recent historians have estimated the death toll in the range of six to 13 million.\n\nThe Great Purge (, transliterated \"Bolshaya chistka\") was a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union orchestrated by Joseph Stalin in 1937–1938. It involved the purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, repression of peasants, deportations of ethnic minorities, and the persecution of unaffiliated persons, characterized by widespread police surveillance, widespread suspicion of \"saboteurs\", imprisonment, and killings. Estimates of the number of deaths associated with the Great Purge run from the official figure of 681,692 to nearly 1 million.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, political repressions not only targeted individual persons, but they also targeted whole ethnic, social and religious groups as well as other categories within the Soviet population.\n\nPopulation transfer in the Soviet Union may be divided into the following broad categories: deportations of \"anti-Soviet\" categories within the population, who were often classified as \"enemies of the workers\"; deportations of nationalities; labor force transfer; and organised migrations in opposite directions in order to fill the ethnically cleansed territories. In most cases their destinations were underpopulated and remote areas (see Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union).\n\nEntire nations and ethnic groups were collectively punished by the Soviet Government for their alleged collaboration with the enemy during World War II. At least nine distinct ethnic-linguistic groups, including ethnic Germans, ethnic Greeks, ethnic Poles, Crimean Tatars, Balkars, Chechens, and Kalmyks, were deported to remote and unpopulated areas of Siberia (see sybirak) and Kazakhstan. Population transfer in the Soviet Union led to millions of deaths that resulted from the hardships that it inflicted upon its victims. Koreans and Romanians were also deported. Mass operations of the NKVD were needed to deport hundreds of thousands of people.\nThe Soviet famine of 1932–1933 was severely aggravated by the actions of the government of the Soviet Union, such as its confiscation of food, the lack of meat, planned delivery limitations which ignored the consequences of the famine, blocking the migration of its starving population, and the suppression of information about the famine, all of which prevented any organized relief effort. This led to the death of millions of people in the affected areas. The overall number of victims who perished during the 1932–1933 famine is variously estimated to be 6–7 million people Soviet-wide or 6–8 million.\n\nThe Gulag \"was the branch of the State Security that operated the penal system of forced labour camps and associated detention and transit camps and prisons. While these camps housed criminals of all types, the Gulag system has become primarily known as a place for political prisoners and as a mechanism for repressing political opposition to the Soviet state.\" Russian author and former prisoner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote extensively about the gulag and its history in his series of books The Gulag Archipelago.\n\nDuring the early years of World War II Soviet Union annexed several territories in East Europe as the consequence of the German–Soviet Pact and its .\n\nIn the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, repressions and the mass deportations were carried out by the Soviets. The Serov Instructions, \"\"On the Procedure for carrying out the Deportation of Anti-Soviet Elements from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia\"\", contained detailed procedures and protocols to observe in the deportation of Baltic nationals. Public tribunals were also set up to punish \"traitors to the people\": those who had fallen short of the \"political duty\" of voting their countries into the USSR. In the first year of Soviet occupation, from June 1940 to June 1941, the number confirmed executed, conscripted, or deported is estimated at a minimum of 124,467: 59,732 in Estonia, 34,250 in Latvia, and 30,485 in Lithuania. This included 8 former heads of state and 38 ministers from Estonia, 3 former heads of state and 15 ministers from Latvia, and the then president, 5 prime ministers and 24 other ministers from Lithuania.\n\nAfter Stalin's death, the suppression of dissent was dramatically reduced and took new forms. The internal critics of the system were convicted for anti-Soviet agitation, Anti-Soviet slander, or as \"social parasites\". Others were labeled as mentally ill, having sluggish schizophrenia and incarcerated in \"psikhushkas\", i.e. mental hospitals used by the Soviet authorities as prisons. A number of notable dissidents, including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vladimir Bukovsky, and Andrei Sakharov, were sent to internal or external exile.\n\nEstimates of the number of deaths attributable to Joseph Stalin vary widely. Some scholars assert that record-keeping of the executions of political prisoners and ethnic minorities are neither reliable nor complete, others contend archival materials contain irrefutable data far superior to sources utilized prior to 1991, such as statements from emigres and other informants. Those historians working after the Soviet Union's dissolution have estimated victim totals ranging from approximately 3 million to nearly 9 million. Some scholars still assert that the death toll could be in the tens of millions.\n\nIn 2011, the historian Timothy D. Snyder, after assessing 20 years of historical research in Eastern European archives, asserts that Stalin deliberately killed about 6 million (rising to 9 million if foreseeable deaths arising from policies are taken into account)\n\nThe release of previously secret reports from the Soviet archives in the 1990s indicate that the victims of repression in the Stalin era were about 9 million persons. Some historians claim that the death toll was around 20 million based on their own demographic analysis and from dated information published before the release of the reports from the Soviet archives. American historian Richard Pipes noted: \"Censuses revealed that between 1932 and 1939—that is, after collectivization but before World War II—the population decreased by 9 to 10 million people. In his most recent edition of \"The Great Terror\" (2007), Robert Conquest states that while exact numbers may never be known with complete certainty, at least 15 million people were killed \"by the whole range of Soviet regime's terrors\". Rudolph Rummel in 2006 said that the earlier higher victim total estimates are correct, although he includes those killed by the government of the Soviet Union in other Eastern European countries as well. Conversely, J. Arch Getty, Stephen G. Wheatcroft and others insist that the opening of the Soviet archives has vindicated the lower estimates put forth by \"revisionist\" scholars. Simon Sebag Montefiore in 2003 suggested that Stalin was ultimately responsible for the deaths of at least 20 million people\n\nSome of these estimates rely in part on demographic losses. Conquest explained how he arrived at his estimate: \"I suggest about eleven million by the beginning of 1937, and about three million over the period 1937–38, making fourteen million. The eleven-odd million is readily deduced from the undisputed population deficit shown in the suppressed census of January 1937, of fifteen to sixteen million, by making reasonable assumptions about how this was divided between birth deficit and deaths.\"\n\nSome historians also believe that the official archival figures of the categories that were recorded by Soviet authorities are unreliable and incomplete. In addition to failures regarding comprehensive recordings, as one additional example, Canadian historian Robert Gellately and British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore argue that the many suspects beaten and tortured to death while in \"investigative custody\" were likely not to have been counted amongst the executed.Conversely, Australian historian Stephen G. Wheatcroft asserts that prior to the opening of the archives for historical research, \"our understanding of the scale and the nature of Soviet repression has been extremely poor\" and that some specialists who wish to maintain earlier high estimates of the Stalinist death toll are \"finding it difficult to adapt to the new circumstances when the archives are open and when there are plenty of irrefutable data\" and instead \"hang on to their old Sovietological methods with round-about calculations based on odd statements from emigres and other informants who are supposed to have superior knowledge\".\n\nA Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Political Repression (День памяти жертв политических репрессий) has been officially held on 30 October in Russia since 1991. It is also marked in other former Soviet republics with the exception of Ukraine, which has its own annual Day of Remembrance for the victims of political repressions by the Soviet regime, held each year on the third Sunday of May.\n\nMembers of the Memorial society have taken an active part in such commemorative meetings. Since 2007 Memorial has also organised the day-long \"Restoring the Names\" ceremony at the Solovetsky Stone in Moscow every 29 October.\n\nThe Wall of Grief in Moscow, inaugurated in October 2017, is Russia's first monument ordered by presidential decree for people killed during the Stalinist repressions in the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2252705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252705", "title": "Deshret", "text": "Deshret\n\nDeshret, from Ancient Egyptian, was the formal name for the Red Crown of Lower Egypt and for the desert Red Land on either side of Kemet (Black Land), the fertile Nile river basin. When combined with the Hedjet (White Crown) of Upper Egypt, it forms the Pschent (Double Crown), in Ancient Egyptian called the \"sekhemti\".\n\nThe Red Crown in Egyptian language hieroglyphs eventually was used as the vertical letter \"n\" . The original \"n\" hieroglyph from the Predynastic Period, and the Old Kingdom was the sign depicting ripples of water.\n\nIn mythology, the earth deity Geb, original ruler of Egypt, invested Horus with the rule over Lower Egypt. The Egyptian pharaohs, who saw themselves as successors of Horus, wore the \"deshret\" to symbolize their authority over Lower Egypt. Other deities wore the \"deshret\" too, or were identified with it, such as the protective serpent goddess Wadjet and the creator-goddess of Sais, Neith, who often is shown wearing the Red Crown.\n\nThe Red Crown would later be combined with the White Crown of Upper Egypt to form the Double Crown, symbolizing the rule over the whole country, \"The Two Lands\" as the Egyptians expressed it.\n\nAs concerns \"deshret\", the Red Land which comprised the deserts and foreign lands surrounding Egypt, Seth was its lord. It was considered a region of chaos, without law and full of dangers.\n\nNo red crown has been found. Several ancient representations indicate it was woven like a basket from plant fiber such as grass, straw, flax, palm leaf, or reed.\n\nThe Red Crown frequently is mentioned in texts and depicted in reliefs and statues. An early example is the depiction of the victorious pharaoh wearing the \"deshret\" on the Narmer Palette. A label from the reign of Djer records a royal visit to the shrine of the Deshret which may have been located at Buto in the Nile delta.\n\nThe fact that no crown has ever been found buried with any of the pharaohs, even in relatively intact tombs, might suggest that it was passed from one regent to the next, much as in present-day monarchies.\n\nThe ancient Egyptian Red Crown, the Deshret crown, is one of the oldest Egyptian hieroglyphs. As an iconographic element, it is used on the famous Narmer Palette of Pharaoh Narmer as the \"\"Red Crown of the Delta\"\", the Delta being Lower Egypt.\n\nThe first usage of the Red Crown was in iconography as the symbol for Lower Egypt with the Nile Delta. Later it came to be used in the Egyptian language – as an alphabetic uniliteral, vertical form for letter \"n\" as a phoneme or preposition. It became functional in running hieroglyphic texts, where either the horizontal or vertical form preposition satisfied space requirements.\n\nThe Red Crown is also used as a determinative, most notably in the word for deshret. It is also used in other words or names of gods.\n\nOne older use of the red crown hieroglyph is to make the word: 'in'!, (formerly \"an\"-(a-with dot)-(the \"vertical feather\" hieroglyph a, plus the red crown). Egyptian \"in\" is used at the beginning of a text and translates as: \"Behold!\", or \"Lo!\", and is an emphatic.\n\nIn the 198 BC Rosetta Stone, the \" 'Red Crown' \" as hieroglyph has the usage mostly of the vertical form of the preposition \"n\". In running text, word endings are not always at the end of hieroglyph blocks; when they are at the end, a simple transition to start the next block is a vertical separater, in this case the preposition, vertical n, (thus a space saver).\nSince the start of the next hieroglyphic block could also be started with a horizontal \"n\" at the bottom of the previous block, it should be thought that the vertical \"n\" is also chosen for a visual effect; in other words, it visually spreads out the running text of words, instead of piling horizontal prepositions in a more tight text. Visually it is also a hieroglyph that takes up more 'space'-(versus a straight-line type for the horizontal \"water ripple\"); so it may have a dual purpose of a less compact text, and a better segue-transition to the next words.\n\nThe Red Crown hieroglyph is used 35 times in the Rosetta Stone; only 4 times is it used as a non-preposition. It averages once per line usage in the 36 line Decree of Memphis (Ptolemy V)-(Rosetta Stone).\n\n\n"}

In the War of the Sixth Coalition he was drafted to fight in the defence of Paris in 1814. After the war, he gave up on a career as an engineer or stockbroker in order to pursue his mathematical studies.\n\nIn 1837 he published the book \"Aperçu historique sur l'origine et le développement des méthodes en géométrie\" (\"Historical view of the origin and development of methods in geometry\"), a study of the method of reciprocal polars in projective geometry. The work gained him considerable fame and respect and he was appointed Professor at the École Polytechnique in 1841, then he was awarded a chair at the Sorbonne in 1846. A second edition of this book was published in 1875. In 1839, Ludwig Adolph Sohncke (the father of Leonhard Sohncke) translated the original into German as \"Geschichte der geometrie, haupts achlich mit bezug auf die neueren methoden\". Shortly thereafter, in 1841, Charles Graves published an English version as \"Two Geometrical Memoirs on the General Properties of Cones of the Second Degree and on the Spherical Conics\", adding a significant amount of original material.\n\nJakob Steiner had proposed Steiner's conic problem of enumerating the number of conic sections tangent to each of five given conics, and had answered it incorrectly. Chasles developed a theory of characteristics that enabled the correct enumeration of the conics (there are 3264) (see enumerative geometry). He established several important theorems (all called Chasles's theorem). In kinematics, Chasles's description of a Euclidean motion in space as screw displacement was seminal to the development of the theories of dynamics of rigid bodies.\n\nChasles was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1864. In 1865 he was awarded the Copley Medal.\n\nAs described in \"A Treasury of Deception\", by Michael Farquhar (Peguin Books, 2005), between 1861 and 1869 Chasles purchased some of the 27,000 forged letters from Frenchman Denis Vrain-Lucas. Included in this trove were letters from Alexander the Great to Aristotle, from Cleopatra to Julius Caesar, and from Mary Magdalene to a revived Lazarus, all in a fake medieval French. In 2004, the journal \"Critical Inquiry\" published a recently \"discovered\" 1871 letter written by Vrain-Lucas (from prison) to Chasles, conveying Vrain-Lucas's perspective on these events, itself an invention.\n\nIn 1986, Alexander Jones published a commentary on Book 7 of the \"Collection\" of Pappus of Alexandria, which Chasles had referred to in his history of geometric methods. Jones makes these comments about Chasles, Pappus and Euclid:\n\nChasles's name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\n\n"}

The first term was from 1 November 1969 to 1 August 1970 and the second 4 October 1970 to 25 March 1977. He was instrumental in starting number of institutions and development projects in Kerala. Achutha Menon was the only politician who adorned the chief minister ship of Kerala for two consecutive terms. He led the then United Front to a thumping electoral victory in Kerala when Congress party was routed in elections in other parts of India.\n\nBorn to Madathiveettil Achutha Menon (after whom he was named) and Lekshmykutty Amma at Puthukkad, Thrissur District on 13 January 1913. His brother-in-law V. V. Raghavan was also a Communist Party of India politician from Thrissur city. V. V. Raghavan was the Member of Parliament from Thrissur Lok Sabha constituency, in 1996 and 1998. He was married to Ammini Amma, and had three children including 2 daughters and V. Ramankutty.\n\nBeing a brilliant student, he studied on merit scholarship throughout his student life, and stood first in the SSLC examination in the then State of Kochi. He is a former student of Church Mission Society High School, Thrissur (CMSHSS, Thrissur) And after finishing the intermediate level in St. Thomas College, Thrissur, he continued his college education in the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli Madras. There he won a gold medal for academic excellence and was a role model for other fellow students. Menon, then went on to study Law in Government Law College, Thiruvananthapuram and scored the highest marks in Hindu Law. After the B.L. degree, he started legal practice in various courts of Thrissur, during which time he began to get involved in many social issues.\n\nAchutha Menon started his political career by associating himself with the State Congress, and actively took part in the Congress meeting held at Thrissur. He subsequently became a member of the Kochi rajya prajamandalam. He joined the Communist Party of India in 1941 through his involvement in the \"Labour Brotherhood\" movement. Shri. Menon became a Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India and a member of its Executive Committee and Central Secretariat. He continued his political activities, even when the Communist Party was banned. He was imprisoned for many years. The first imprisonment Achutha Menon underwent was in 1940, for one year for making an anti-war speech; and the next in the wake of the \"Quit India\" movement of 9 August 1942 as a detainee for more than a year. He was forced to evade arrest and live \"underground\" for more than three years during the period 1948–51.\n\nAchutha Menon was elected to the Travancore-Cochin State Legislature while \"underground\" in 1952. Shortly afterwards Shri. Achutha Menon became elected to the Kerala Legislative Assembly, after the reorganisation of the States, thus becoming the first Finance Minister of Kerala in the Ministry headed by E.M.S. Namboodirippad in 1957. He presented the first Budget of Kerala state on 7 June 1957. As the so-called \"Vimochanasamaram\" (Liberation Struggle) gained momentum the Home Minister was found unfit to handle the situation and was divested of the crucial portfolio which then was handed over to Menon. He was again elected to the Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1960. Menon also became a member of the Rajyasabha during 1968–69.\n\nDuring the Communist Party split, he continued to remain with the CPI. The political instability during the late sixties had paved the way for a realignment in coalition politics, which had far reaching implication on the political history of the state. He was elected as the State Secretary of C.P.I. too, many times, and was also a member of the National Council of the C.P.I.\n\nIn the 1967 Kerala Legislative Assembly election, his party contested as part of a seven-party alliance named Saptakakshi Munnani. E. M. S. Namboodiripad was sworn in as the Chief Minister but had to resign in 1969 due to internal dissensions within the alliance. Following this, the CPI exited from the coalition and constituted a mini-front which formed government with the external support from Indian National Congress. Achutha Menon was sworn in as Chief Minister on 1 November 1969. Noted as one of the best chief ministers Kerala has had, he continued till the dissolution of the third Kerala Legislative Assembly. The split in the Indian Socialist Party, a coalition partner and group politics within the Congress party led to the fall of his government on 1 August 1970.\n\nIt was under his stewardship that Kerala signed on for continuing with the Mullaperiar Dam agreement with Tamil Nadu, as a part of reviewing the pre-independence agreement between the Kingdom of Travancore and the Madras Presidency. This agreement, experts on the subject believe, fretted away the interests of Kerala and became the prime reason for unenviable situation that Kerala finds itself today in the Mullaperiar issue. He was not a member of the Kerala Assembly then, but subsequently got elected from Kottarakkara in the by-election held in April 1970. In the mid-term poll conducted in 1970, he was again elected this time from Kodakara in Thrissur District and was sworn in as Chief Minister on 4 October 1970 and held office till 1977.\nSree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology was set up during his period. His ministry continued in power for about seven years and implemented reform measures of basic importance such as the Land Reform Act, take-over of private forests without compensation, law on agricultural labour, gratuity of industrial workers, one-lakh housing scheme, etc., not to mention significant steps towards industrialization of Kerala. It was this ministry which enunciated a Science Policy and established a number of \"Centres of Excellence\" in Scientific research in the state. Many institutions like Keltron, NATPAC were started during his tenure.\n\nAchutha Menon retired from active politics in 1977. He suffered multiple health problems during the final years of his life. He died on 16 August 1991, aged 78, at Sree Chithira Thirunal Hospital in Thiruvananthapuram after suffering from a massive heart attack. Incidentally, the place where he died was set up during his period. He was cremated with full state honours at Thrissur, his hometown.\n\nA talented writer, Shri. Achutha Menon had authored many books He wrote many books and articles, mostly related to Marxism, Communism and Indian History. He also translated H.G. Wells' \"Brief History of the World\" into Malayalam. \"Soviet Land\", \"Kissan Padha Pusthakam\", \"Keralam – Prasnangalum Sadhyadhakalum\", \"Smaranayude Edukal\", and \"Manushyan Swayam Nirmikkunnu\"(Translation) are his other famous works.

In the past it has also been used as a home ground by other football teams from the city; Lokomotiv Plovdiv played their home matches on the venue during the second half of the 1979–80 season, as well as one match in the 2003–04 season. It was also used by Spartak Plovdiv for several games during the 1995–96 season.\n\nSince the middle of 2014 the stadium's reconstruction is on hold, due to the lack of financing. It is estimated that nearly €15,000,000 are needed in order for it to be completed. The club and its fans are searching for investors.\n\nIn 1959, the authorities allowed the construction of a new club stadium at the place of the old field in the neighborhood of Kamenitza. As a result, building works began, and nearly two years later, Botev Plovdiv returned to their home ground. The reconstructed stadium had a capacity of 35,000 people and electric lightning. On 14 May 1961 it was inaugurated with a friendly match between Botev Plovdiv and Steaua București, which won by the club from Bulgaria with 3–0.\nIn the years from 1926 to 1947, Botev Plovdiv played six international matches on the ground, they were against Admira Vienna (1–7), Kecskemét (3–2 and 2–4), Besiktas (0–0), Bohemians Prague (1–3) and the famous \"wonderteam\" of Austria Vienna (sensational win with 5–4). The attendance record of 40,000 people was set on 27 February 1963 during the quarter-final of the Cup Winner's Cup against Atlético Madrid (1–1). The record of 37,000 people for the Bulgarian championship was set in 1966 against Levski Sofia (0–1). Due to the riots between the fans, and the rush of fans on the field, Botev Plovdiv was forced to host its derby matches at the Plovdiv Stadium.\n\nThe renovations from this period include moving the away teams's changing room to the eastern part of the stadium. In order to connect the changing room with the field a tunnel was built under the east and north stand, this slightly affected the overall capacity of the stadium.\n\nIn 1995 electric lighting was installed, but it failed to reach the standards of the Bulgarian Football Union.\n\nThe stadium underwent minor renovations in the summer. The away team's changing room was moved under the central stand once again, the room was then modernised, other actions included improving the overall safety and security.\n\nThe renovations included replacing the field's old grass surface with a new one, under which were set up new drainage, watering and heating systems. New football goals were placed, and 400 seats were mounted on the central stand.\n\nFollowing the renovations in 2012, which were the first phase in the reconstruction of the new stadium, in mid 2013 the second phase was activated and the east stand was demolished. The initial plan was to demolish the old stands and rebuild them one at a time and closer to the football field, but in order for the stadium to host the 2015 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, a new less time-consuming plan was designed and in December the same year, all of the remaining stands were decimated. The change in plans forced Botev Plovdiv to play its home games on the club's training base, the Botev 1912 Football Complex, which is located in the neighbourhood of Komatevo.\n\nOn 5 March 2014 a new and improved version of the stadium was presented by the directors of the club and the designing architect. The club decided to change the vision, due to the higher targets they wanted to meet. The new stadium had to be ready for operation by mid 2015, in order to host the 2015 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. The plans included an overall capacity of 18,777 spectators, of which 1500 places were for the visiting fans. Other concepts included covering 75% of the seats, as well as building a parking with a capacity of 600 places for cars and 7 for buses. The stadium was supposed to be able to host semifinals from the European club tournaments, such as Europa League and Champions League.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the reconstruction of the new stadium temporarily stopped, due to the fact that Botev Plovdiv's main sponsor ‒ Corporate Commercial Bank experienced issues. On 6 November 2014 the license of the bank was revoked. The reason for the revocation, according to the Bulgarian National Bank, was a significant exposure of the bank's credit sheet to investors related to Tsvetan Vasilev (who at that time was the owner of Botev Plovdiv and the chairman of Corporate Commercial Bank). The lack of financing forced the club to stop the reconstruction, and search for new investors.\n\n"}
{"id": "2252725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252725", "title": "Hedjet", "text": "Hedjet\n\nHedjet ( \"White One\") is the formal name for the white crown of pharaonic Upper Egypt. After the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, it was combined with the deshret, the red crown of Lower Egypt, to form the pschent, the double crown of Egypt. The symbol sometimes used for the white crown was the vulture goddess Nekhbet shown next to the head of the cobra goddess Wadjet, the uraeus on the pschent.\n\nThe white crown, along with the red crown, has a long history with each of their respective representations going back into the Predynastic Period, indicating that kingship had been the base of Egyptian society for some time. The earliest image of the hedjet was thought to have been in the Qustul in Nubia. According to Jane Roy, \"New evidence from Abydos, however, particularly the excavation of Cemetery U and the tomb U-j, dating to Naqada IIIA has shown that this iconography appears earlier in Egypt.\n\nNekhbet, the tutelary goddess of Nekhebet (modern el Kab) near Hierakonpolis, was depicted as a woman, sometimes with the head of a vulture, wearing the white crown. The falcon god Horus of Hierakonpolis (Egyptian: Nekhen) was generally shown wearing a white crown. A famous depiction of the white crown is on the Narmer palette found at Hierakonpolis in which the king of the South wearing the \"hedjet\" is shown triumphing over his northern enemies. The kings of the united Egypt saw themselves as successors of Horus. Vases from the reign of Khasekhemwy show the king as Horus wearing the white crown.\n\nAs with the deshret (red crown), no example of the white crown has been found. It is unknown how it was constructed and what materials were used. Felt or leather have been suggested, but this is purely speculative. Like the deshret, the hedjet may have been woven like a basket from plant fiber such as grass, straw, flax, palm leaf, or reed. The fact that no crown has ever been found, even in relatively intact royal tombs such as that of Tutankhamun, suggests the crowns may have been passed from one regent to the next, much as in present-day monarchies.\n\n"}

{"id": "2252734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252734", "title": "War Wind", "text": "War Wind\n\nWar Wind is a 1996 real-time strategy game in the vein of \"\". It was developed by DreamForge Intertainment and published by Strategic Simulations, Inc. It runs on Microsoft Windows and used DirectX 2.0. A sequel to \"War Wind\", titled \"\", was released by DreamForge and SSI in 1997. Both games were digitally re-released on GOG.com.\n\nSome sites list the release date of War Winds as Aug. 24, 1996 while others say Sept. 30, 1996. The most recent file on a War Wind CD bought in the U.S. in January 1997 was Oct. 10, 1996 (as is the date stated in its version 1.0 README.TXT), but this could have been an updated CD release.\n\n\"War Wind\" takes place on the world of Yavaun, where four races have co-existed for millennia. The Tha'Roon are the thinkers, leaders and overlords of the planet. They have dominated the other races on the globe. In particular, the Tha'Roon have enslaved the tree-like Eaggra, forcing them to act as their builders and engineers. The Tha'Roon accomplish this through their bullying and domination of the Obblinox, slow-moving but extremely strong silicon lifeforms specialized in cyborgs. Lastly are the reclusive Shama'Li, monk-like practitioners of magic, who desire to unify the four races.\n\nThe basic gameplay is very similar to other real-time strategy games such as the Warcraft series. A game starts with a clan leader, and usually some workers and a token defence force. The player must use these workers to build structures and mine for resources. Some unique features differentiate the game from others in the genre. For example, in order to get any combat unit other than mercenaries, a worker must be trained at a particular type of building. In order to receive a higher level combat unit, a lower-level unit must be promoted at a specific facility. Additionally, units can be individually upgraded in a variety of areas such as speed, strength, resilience, stealth, and vision. The purpose for these micro upgrades is to encourage more strategic conflicts, wherein a player must make the most of small numbers of units instead of building a large force and rushing the opponent.\n\nAnother unique aspect of \"War Wind\" is stealth. Many units possess the ability to conceal themselves in different ways. \"Masked\" units do not appear on the opponent's minimap. \"Disguised\" units appear as friendly workers to an enemy player. \"Hidden\" units do not appear on the minimap and look translucent on the main map. \"Invisible\" units appear on neither the opponent's minimap nor their main map.\n\nStealth is always broken, regardless of level, when a unit attacks or is attacked. It will not be restored unless the unit remains out of combat for a period of time. Additionally, units with vision upgrades have the ability to see through stealth, and clan leaders can see through stealth without vision upgrades. Certain spells, such as the Shama'Li's Seer or vision quest abilities, will reveal stealthed units. An additional level of stealth can be granted through the Tha'Roon spell MindShield.\n\nAs with most real-time strategy games, \"War Wind\" features a fog of war mechanic. The player can only see within a certain range of their units. Fog of war will conceal any unit completely and also mask any structures built. The fog does not conceal natural land formations, even those that have not been seen yet. There are also trees on the map which prevent units from seeing into them. However, once a unit enters a tree, he can see just as far as he would normally be able to.\n\n\"War Wind\" is strongly focused on single-player play. The player can choose one of four campaigns (one for each race). Each campaign has seven battles, and advances the story through cut-scenes and in-game dialog. Each race has a notably different goal.\n\nEach race also has different units, structures they can build and radically different abilities. While this became standard for the genre after \"StarCraft\" (released two years later), in 1996 this was something of an innovation. Earlier games (such as \"Dune II\") featured different sides with different attributes, but not to the dramatic extent found in \"War Wind\".\n\nAnother innovation for the time is the ability to bring upgraded units from mission to mission. This ability to transfer a modded unit forces players to consider their choices, and put more stock into which modifications are used and keeping that character alive. This is meant to contrast with the typical convention of the genre that a unit can be easily replaced if lost.\n\nThe roles are respectively: Clan Leader, Basic Worker, Advanced Worker, Mercenary, Warrior, Advanced Warrior, War Machine, Scout, advanced Scout, mages, and Advanced Mages. Additionally there are Hero Units that do not fall under any one Category and are unique to assorted missions and scenarios.\n\"War Wind\" has unique monsters (sometimes referred to as \"critters\") that have no affiliation with any of the four selectable races. Generally, monsters will only attack when they are attacked first or they are \"touched\" by an adjacent unit controlled by the computer or the player.\n\n\nThe game was a finalist for \"Computer Gaming World\"s and CNET Gamecenter's 1996 \"Strategy Game of the Year\" awards, both of which ultimately went to \"Civilization II\". Gamecenter's editors called it \"easily the deepest real-time game to date.\"\n"}

Excluding its usage in collecting national statistics, particularly census data, these definitions rely upon the discontinued Reykjavík capital proper.\n\nIn addition, the borders of the previous Reykjanes region, as defined by the government and regional authorities, have shifted, resulting in the loss of many municipalities to the newly formed Southern Peninsula area. Other major changes have also been included, such as the redistribution of over twenty subdivisions, most notably the transfer of the city of Höfn to the Eastern Region.\n\nThese regions are not defined by law and have no official standing or administrative function, but are used to divide Iceland for certain purposes. The country's healthcare program is divided into seven districts. These regions mostly correspond to those detailed below, although a few updates have yet to be fully implemented.

In all combustion engines, a great percentage of the heat generated (around 44%) escapes through the exhaust, not through the metal fins of an air-cooled engine (12%). About 8% of the heat energy is transferred to the oil, which although primarily meant for lubrication, also plays a role in heat dissipation via a cooler. \"Air-cooled engines\" are used generally in applications which would not suit liquid cooling, as such modern air-cooled engines are used in motorcycles, general aviation aircraft, lawn mowers, generators, outboard motors, pump sets, saw benches and auxiliary power units. \n\nMost modern internal combustion engines are cooled by a closed circuit carrying liquid coolant through channels in the engine block and cylinder head, where the coolant absorbs heat, to a heat exchanger or radiator where the coolant releases heat into the air (or raw water, in the case of marine engines). Thus, while they are not \"ultimately\" cooled by the liquid, because of the liquid-coolant circuit they are known as \"water-cooled\". In contrast, heat generated by an air-cooled engine is released directly into the air. Typically this is facilitated with metal fins covering the outside of the Cylinder Head and cylinders which increase the surface area that air can act on. Air may be force fed with the use of a fan and shroud to achieve efficient cooling with high volumes of air or simply by natural air flow with well designed and angled fins.\n\nIn all combustion engines, a great percentage of the heat generated (around 44%) escapes through the exhaust, not through either a liquid cooling system nor through the metal fins of an air-cooled engine (12%). About 8% of the heat energy finds its way into the oil, which although primarily meant for lubrication, also plays a role in heat dissipation via a cooler. Air cooled engines usually run noisier, however it provides more simplicity which gives benefits when it comes to servicing and part replacement and is usually cheaper to be maintained.\n\nMany motorcycles use air cooling for the sake of reducing weight and complexity. Few current production automobiles have air-cooled engines (such as Tatra 815), but historically it was common for many high-volume vehicles. Examples of past air-cooled road vehicles, in roughly chronological order, include:\n\nMost aviation piston engines are air-cooled. While water cooled engines were widely used from the early days of flight, air cooled engines were the dominant choice in aircraft. Following the Second World War, turbojets and jet turbine powered aircraft have come to dominate flight regimes where water cooled piston engines offered the advantage of reduced drag. Today, piston engines are mostly used in slower general aviation aircraft where the greater drag produced by air cooled engines is not a major disadvantage. Therefore, most aero engines produced today are of the air cooled variety. Today, most of the engines currently (2005) manufactured by Lycoming and Continental and used by major manufacturers of light aircraft Cirrus, Cessna and so on.\n\nOther engine manufactures using air-cooled engine technology are ULPower and Jabiru, more active in the Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) and ultralight aircraft market. Rotax uses a combination of air-cooled cylinders and liquid-cooled cylinder heads.\n\nSome small diesel engines, e.g. those made by Deutz AG and Lister Petter are air-cooled. Probably the only big Euro 5 truck air-cooled engine (V8 320 kW power 2100 N·m torque one) is being produced by Tatra.\n\nStationary or portable engines were commercially introduced early in the 1900s. The first commercial production was by the New Way Motor Company of Lansing, Michigan, US. The company produced air-cooled engines in single and twin cylinders in both horizontal and vertical cylinder format. Subsequent to their initial production which was exported worldwide, other companies took up the advantages of this cooling method, especially in small portable engines. Applications include mowers, generators, outboard motors, pump sets, saw benches and auxiliary power plants and more.\n\n"}

They were built in two discrete groups, the earlier Belvoir\" group designed by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company and the subsequent (and slightly larger) Aberdare\" group designed by the Admiralty. They were classed as Fleet Minesweeping Sloops, that is ships intended to clear open water. The \"Belvoir\" group were named after British fox hunts. Those of the \"Aberdare\" group were originally named after coastal towns, watering places and fishing ports, some of which happened to be hunts by coincidence. However, all were soon renamed after inland locations to prevent confusion caused by the misunderstanding of signals and orders.\n\nThese ships had twin screws and had forced-draught coal burning boilers, that is they burned pulverised coal in an artificially augmented airstream. One consequence of this was that they produced a lot of smoke, so much so that they were more usually referred to as \"Smokey Joes\". Another was that if they were fed anything other than the Welsh Steam Coal they were designed for then the fuel consumption was enormous—one ship was bunkered with soft brown Natal coal and burnt 20 tons in a single day.\n\nThey had a shallow draught (8 feet, 2.43 metres). Armament was one QF gun forward and a QF 12 pounder aft, plus two twin 0.303 inch machine guns. They were equipped for sweeping with Oropesa floats only, that is to cut the cables of moored mines.\n\nSix ships were completed as survey vessels, and the majority of the \"Aberdare\" group arrived too late to see service during the First World War. Thirty-five were cancelled after the armistice. Interwar, eight were sold out of service, one was sold to Siam, one was converted to an RNVR drillship and 52 were scrapped. The majority of the remainder spent the period from 1919 to 1939 in reserve around the world, with Malta and Singapore having most of them, so that on the outbreak of World War II there were still 27 available for service, to which a further two were requisitioned from mercantile service.\n\nThe 5th Minesweeping Flotilla, comprising \"Pangourne\", \"Ross\", \"Lydd\", \"Kellet\" and \"Albury\" as well as the newer \"Halcyon\"-class \"Gossamer\" and \"Leda\" sailed from North Shields for Harwich late on 26 May 1940, reaching Harwich nearly 24 hours later. After coaling, the flotilla sailed for Dunkirk in the afternoon of 28 May, and was off the beach by about 21:30 hours the same day. At least two ships from the Flotilla (\"Ross\" and \"Lydd\") were detailed to collect troops from the harbour mole. \"Ross\" alone took on board 353 men and one dog on this first night. The ships of the flotilla made a further three trips to Dunkirk in the following days, working at battle-stations virtually round the clock and returning to Margate for the last time from Dunkirk on Saturday, 1 June 1940. \"Sutton\" was also present at Dunkirk.\n\nFive ships were lost during the war, and a further vessel, \"Widnes\" was beached in Suda Bay, Crete in May 1941 after being bombed by German aircraft. The Germans recovered and repaired the hull, pressing her into service as \"12.V4\".

Radica brand barcodes have the additional feature of being able to act as a healing code in the first 2 iterations of the game.\n\nThe original Skannerz came in three versions which represented the three tribes. Zendra (blue), Pataak (green) and Ujalu (red). If a player scanned a barcode containing a rival tribe's monster, a battle would be initiated. Also items could be gathered from Universal Product Code barcodes. Another feature is the two player battle system where two units could be linked together and battle. There are 126 monsters to collect and control between the 3 controllers. Released in 2000.\n\nThe Skannerz Commander is second in the series. There are no \"tribes\" in this version nor are there different models. With this model the user that scans can get the opponent's monster by winning, but will also lose a monster with a loss. The Skannerz Commander game is incompatible with the original Skannerz models. It was released in 2001.\n\nThe Skannerz Racerz is the third in the Skannerz series, where you can scan barcodes, and race cars from three classes: \"Off-Road\", \"Drag\", and \"Street\".\nThere are 120 cars in total, which consists of 40 cars per class. The game also has 64 optional parts you can install onto any of your vehicles to upgrade them. You start the game with a basic vehicle known as the \"Gizmo\" and you must win a certain number of races to progress in rank, from Rookie to Amateur to Pro. Cars and parts can be obtained by scanning barcodes and either receiving a car from the dealership or beating your opponent in a Pink Slip style race. Parts are also obtained the same way as dealership cars, but are received from the Garage. Only one of each car and car part can be obtained. Hindrances can pop up anytime you scan a barcode in the form of losing your car to the police, being impounded or a modified car crashing into a tree and losing a part. Races involve beating the other opponent and also involve 5 Speed Gear changes. Each track has its own obstacles: Off-road has bumps you have to avoid, drag involves your car swaying from side to side along the track and street involves your car slowing and sliding around turns.\n\nThe fourth Skannerz series did not involve barcode scanning. The Skannerz Orbz are balls that act as arenas for other monsters. Not all previous monsters are included but the selected were put into disks (\"dizks\") which plug into the orb. The orb has two halves, the bottom half is the storage compartment for the whereas the top half is where the are inserted and battled. The have a larger focus on strategy, the player must choose the monsters and strategy before the battle starts, once the battle does commence the player has no control over the battle except to cheer the team on. The top half of the orb can be connected to another top half of a separate player. This battle is set up the same but at the end of a player battle the winner is given special items.\n\nThere are 126 monsters to collect divided evenly between the first three consoles and 12 secret monsters (commonly known as the \"Exiles\") that any console can get. The Skannerz Commander console has another 126 monsters and 12 secret monsters that are unobtainable on the other models.\n\nMonsters can be obtained through scanning a product barcode, and made to fight other monsters through a battle with another controller, or a battle with a NPC when a barcode belonging to another console is scanned.\n\nEach monster has up to three attacks that can be learned when it gains enough HP. Generally, each attack is more powerful than the last, and the player may choose which one to use to fight.\n\n\n"}

He first joined the Labour Party in 1936 after becoming interested in the ideas of William Morris.\n\nHe did not go to university. As a keen sportsman, Donnelly became secretary of the London Grasshoppers Rugby Club on leaving school and while working as an office boy. At the age of 17 he set up the \"British Empire Cricket XI\", which continued through the war years, supporting cricket, and raising funds for the Duke of Gloucester's Red Cross and the St John fund. He enlisted in the Royal Air Force in 1939 and served as a Flying Officer with Bomber Command. Later he joined the 'Desert Air Force' in the North African Campaign and Italy where he rose to the rank of Flight Lieutenant.\n\nIn the 1945 general election, Donnelly fought the constituency of Evesham in Worcestershire for Common Wealth, an idealistic socialist party generally regarded as to the left of Labour. Although there was no Labour Party candidate, Donnelly was narrowly pushed into third place by the Liberal Party candidate.\n\nCommon Wealth did not long survive the election and Donnelly rejoined Labour in September 1945. From 1945 to 1946 he lectured at the RAF Staff College. On leaving the RAF, Donnelly became assistant editor and later editor of \"Town and Country Planning\", the journal of the Town and Country Planning Association. From 1948 was that Association's Director. He contested the 1946 Down by-election as a Northern Ireland Labour Party candidate.\n\nDonnelly was chosen to fight Pembrokeshire for the Labour Party in the 1950 general election, which a good Labour candidate had narrowly failed to win in 1945 and where the sitting Member, Gwilym Lloyd George, was very popular, not merely because he was the son of David Lloyd George. Despite the general trend away from the Labour Party, Donnelly beat Lloyd George by playing on the fact that he was supporting the Conservatives, and won the seat by 129 votes.\n\nIn Parliament, he defined himself as \"an Englishman with an Irish name sitting for a Welsh seat\" and initially allied with Aneurin Bevan. He also made sure to build extensive contacts within his constituency, where he became very popular. Although his seat never became entirely safe, he was never taken to the wire. While serving as an MP, Donnelly upped his income by acting as a consultant to the engineering firms David Brown and Philips Industries and to the merchant bankers Hill Samuel.\n\nIn 1954, Donnelly fell out with Bevan over the issue of German rearmament which he considered necessary. He was also outspokenly anti-Soviet Union, a position which intensified after he made trips to the Soviet bloc. After 1955, he became known as a vociferous opponent of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a general supporter of Hugh Gaitskell as Labour leader.\n\nThis ensured his appointment as political correspondent for the \"Daily Herald\" from 1959, but Gaitskell's death in 1963 brought in Harold Wilson with whom Donnelly was not pleased; although his skills would have merited appointment to Wilson's government after the 1964 election, Wilson offered Donnelly nothing.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Donnelly decided to call for an alliance between the Labour Party and the Liberal Party. He also joined with another Labour MP, Woodrow Wyatt, to publicly oppose the Labour Party policy of nationalising the Steel industry; given the narrow majority which Wilson's government had in its first term, their opposition would have been enough to vote down the plan, and any moves had to be postponed until after the 1966 election gave a landslide majority.\n\nDonnelly began causing increasing trouble to the Labour Party whips after the election. He became chief political correspondent for the \"News of the World\" in 1967 which ensured his views were widely known. He heaped scorn on the government's handling of the economy and called for a fundamental change to the relation of the party to the trade unions \"in which the unions do not look on the Labour Party as their pet poodle\".\n\nThe final breach in relations came after spending cuts caused by devaluation of the Pound sterling in November 1967 forced the government to withdraw from defence commitments 'east of Suez'. Donnelly resigned the Labour Party whip in the House of Commons on 18 January 1968. The Labour Party responded on 27 March by expelling him from membership of the party entirely.\n\nAt a meeting of the Monday Club in 1968, Donnelly received a two-minute standing ovation, and then told members \"Mr Wilson should resign and leave public life\". However he was not willing to join the Conservative Party and instead set up his own party, initially known as 'Our Party' but later the Democratic Party. In some respects the party's policy was to the right of the Conservatives, advocating the abolition of the welfare state, sweeping changes to the taxation system, and the return of national service. The party fought five seats at the 1970 general election but polled poorly. Donnelly himself lost Pembrokeshire to the Conservatives.\n\nAbruptly, in April 1971, Donnelly announced that he had joined the Conservative Party, without warning the members of the Democratic Party. He explained that the Conservative Party closely reflected his views on reform of the law relating to trades unions and EEC entry, and attended the Conservative Party conference that October as a delegate from Cities of London and Westminster. He applied for, but did not get, the Conservative nomination for the Hove by-election in 1973, and was also rejected for Melton for the next general election.\n\nIn addition to prolific journalism (he specialised in book reviews), Donnelly had gone into business after his defeat in 1970 and became chairman of ICPS Ltd and Managing Director of Practical Europe Ltd. In the recession of 1973 and 1974, his companies struggled financially and this combined with his failure to get back into the House of Commons as a Conservative to cause serious depression.\n\nDonnelly committed suicide in a hotel room at West Drayton near Heathrow Airport on 3 April 1974, by drinking a large amount of vodka and taking a massive overdose of barbiturates.\n\n"}

The period of his activity is fixed by the anecdote which Xenophon records of the conversation between him and Socrates on the subject of art; he was therefore distinguished as a painter before 399 BC. Seneca relates a tale that Parrhasius bought one of the Olynthians whom Philip sold into slavery, 346 BC, and tortured him in order to have a model for a picture of the bound Prometheus for the Parthenon in Athens; but the story, which is similar to one told of Michelangelo, is chronologically impossible.\n\nPliny the Elder described Parrhasius's contest with Zeuxis in his book \"Naturalis Historia\": The latter painted some grapes so perfectly that a flock of birds flew down to eat them but, instead, only pecked at their picture. Zeuxis had fooled the birds with his picture. Parrhasius and Zeuxis walked to Parrhasius's studio whereupon Parrhasius asked Zeuxis to draw aside the curtain and witness his own masterpiece. When Zeuxis attempted to do so, he realized that the curtain was not a curtain, but a painting of a curtain. Zeuxis acknowledged himself to be surpassed, for while Zeuxis had deceived the birds, Parrhasius had deceived Zeuxis. This one of the earliest examples mentioned of the idea of Trompe-l'œil.\n\nParrhasius was universally placed in the very first rank among painters. His skillful drawing of outlines is especially praised, and many of his drawings on wood and parchment were preserved and highly valued by later painters for purposes of study. He first attained skill in making his figures appear to stand out from the background. His picture of Theseus adorned the Capitol in Rome. His other works, besides the obscene subjects with which he is said to have amused his leisure, are chiefly mythological groups. A picture of the Demos, the personified People of Athens, is famous; according to the story, which is probably based upon epigrams, the twelve prominent characteristics of the people, though apparently quite inconsistent with each other, were distinctly expressed in this figure.\n\nParrhasius is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Australian lizard, \"Lygisaurus parrhasius\", the fire-tailed rainbow-skink.\n"}
{"id": "2252808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252808", "title": "History of suicide", "text": "History of suicide\n\nAttitudes toward suicide have varied through time and across cultures.\n\nThe first recorded person to commit suicide was Empedocles. One of his beliefs was that Death was a transformation. It is possible this idea influenced his suicide. Empedocles died by throwing himself into the Sicilian volcano, Mount Etna. \nIn general, the pagan world, both Roman and Greek, had a relaxed attitude towards the concept of suicide. \n\nThe Council of Arles (452) stated \"if a slave commits suicide no reproach shall fall upon his master.\" \nThere are some precursors of Christian hostility to suicide in ancient Greek thinkers. Pythagoras, for example, was against the act, though more on mathematical than moral grounds, believing that there was only a finite number of souls for use in the world, and that the sudden and unexpected departure of one would upset a delicate balance. Aristotle also condemned suicide, though for quite different reasons— in that it robbed the community of the services of one of its members.\n\nIn Rome, suicide was never a general offense in law, though the whole approach to the question was essentially pragmatic. It was specifically forbidden in three cases: those accused of capital crimes, soldiers and slaves. The reason behind all three was the same - it was \"uneconomic\" for these people to die. If the accused killed themselves prior to trial and conviction then the state lost the right to seize their property, a loophole that was only closed by Domitian in the 1st century AD, who decreed that those who died prior to trial were without legal heirs. The suicide of a soldier was treated on the same basis as desertion. If a slave killed himself or herself within six months of purchase, the master could claim a full refund from the former owner.\n\nThe Romans, however, fully approved of what might be termed \"patriotic suicide\"; death, in other words, as an alternative to dishonor. For the Stoics, a philosophical sect which originated in Greece, death was a guarantee of personal freedom, an escape from an unbearable reality that had nothing left to give. And so it was for Cato the Younger, who killed himself after the Pompeian cause was defeated at the Battle of Thapsus. This was a 'virtuous death', one guided by reason and conscience. His example was later followed by Seneca, though under somewhat more straitened circumstances, as he had been ordered to do so on suspicion of being involved with the Pisonian conspiracy to kill Emperor Nero. A very definite line was drawn by the Romans between the virtuous suicide and suicide for entirely private reasons. They disapproved of Mark Antony not because he killed himself, but that he killed himself for love.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Christian church excommunicated people who attempted suicide and those who died by suicide were buried outside consecrated graveyards. The Church had drawn-out discussions on the edge where the search for martyrdom was suicidal, as in the case of some of the martyrs of Córdoba. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was far more severe in its punishment: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.\n\nAttitudes towards suicide slowly began to shift during the Renaissance; Thomas More the English humanist, wrote in \"Utopia\" (1516) that a person afflicted with disease can “free himself from this bitter life…since by death he will put an end not to enjoyment but to torture...it will be a pious and holy action”. It was assisted suicide, and killing oneself for other reasons was still a crime for people in his Utopia, punished by the denial of funeral rites. John Donne's work \"Biathanatos\" contained one of the first modern defenses of suicide, bringing proof from the conduct of Biblical figures, such as Jesus, Samson and Saul, and presenting arguments on grounds of reason and nature to sanction suicide in certain circumstances.\n\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries, loopholes were invented to avoid the damnation that was promised by most Christian doctrine as a penalty of suicide. One famous example of someone who wished to end their life but avoid the eternity in hell was Christina Johansdotter (died 1740). She was a Swedish murderer who killed a child in Stockholm with the sole purpose of being executed. She is an example of those who seek suicide through execution by committing a murder, similar to suicide by cop.\n\nThe secularization of society that began during The Enlightenment questioned traditional religious attitudes toward suicide to eventually form the modern perspective on the issue. David Hume denied that suicide was a crime as it affected no one and was potentially to the advantage of the individual. In his 1777 \"Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul\" he rhetorically asked “Why should I prolong a miserable existence, because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me?” A shift in public opinion at large can also be discerned; \"The Times\" in 1786 initiated a spirited debate on the motion “Is suicide an act of courage?”\n\nBy the 19th-century, the act of suicide had shifted from being viewed as caused by sin to being caused by insanity in Europe. Although suicide remained illegal during this period, it increasingly became the target of satirical comment, such as the spoof advertisement in the 1839 \"Bentley’s Miscellany\" for a \"London Suicide Company\" or the Gilbert and Sullivan musical \"The Mikado\" that satirized the idea of executing someone who had already killed himself.\n\nBy 1879, English law began to distinguish between suicide and homicide, although suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate. In 1882, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England and by the mid 20th century, suicide had become legal in much of the western world.\n\nIn ancient times, suicide sometimes followed defeat in battle, to avoid capture and possible subsequent torture, mutilation, or enslavement by the enemy. The Caesarean assassins Brutus and Cassius, for example, killed themselves after their defeat at the battle of Philippi. Insurgent Jews died in a mass suicide at Masada in 74 CE rather than face enslavement by the Romans. \n\nDuring World War II, Japanese units would often fight to the last man rather than surrender. Towards the end of the war, the Japanese navy sent pilots to attack Allied ships. These tactics reflect the influence of the samurai warrior culture, where seppuku was often required after a loss of honor.\n\nIn recent decades, suicide attacks have been used extensively by Islamist militants. However, suicide is strictly forbidden by Islamic law, and the terrorist leaders of the Middle Eastern heretic groups who organize these attacks do not regard them as suicide, but as martyrdom operations. They argue the difference to be that in suicide a person kills himself out of despair, while in a martyrdom operation a person is killed as a pure act. This attitude is not universally held by all Muslim clerics.\n\nSpies have carried suicide pills to use when captured, partly to avoid the misery of captivity, but also to avoid being forced to disclose secrets. For the latter reason, spies may even have orders to kill themselves if captured – for example, Gary Powers had a suicide pill, but did not use it when he was captured.\n\nSlave suicide in the United States before the American Civil War has been seen as a social protest. Some slaves were portrayed by abolitionist writers, such as William Lloyd Garrison, as those that ended their lives in response to the hypocrisy of the American Constitution. Abolitionists have had differing views on slave suicide. Many cases were published in hope of convincing the public that slaves were protesting the slave society by ending their lives.\n\nIn the 1960s, Buddhist monks, most notably Thích Quảng Đức, in South Vietnam gained Western praise in their protests against President Ngô Đình Diệm by burning themselves to death. Similar events were reported in eastern Europe, such as Jan Palach and Ryszard Siwiec following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1970 Greek geology student Kostas Georgakis burned himself to death in Genoa, Italy to protest against the Greek military junta of 1967-1974.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution in China (1966–1976), numerous publicly known figures, especially intellectuals and writers, are reported to have committed suicide, typically to escape persecution, typically at the hands of the Red Guards. Some, or perhaps many, of these reported suicides are suspected by many observers to have, in fact, not been voluntary but instead the result of mistreatment. Some reported suicides include famed writer Lao She, among the best-known 20th-century Chinese writers, and journalist Fan Changjiang.\n\nEliyahu Rips, who studied mathematics in Latvian University, on April 13, 1969 attempted self-immolation at the Freedom Monument in Riga in order to protest against Soviet military invasion of Czechoslovakia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252810", "title": "Richard Carlile", "text": "Richard Carlile\n\nRichard Carlile (8 December 1790 – 10 February 1843) was an important agitator for the establishment of universal suffrage and freedom of the press in the United Kingdom.\n\nBorn in Ashburton, Devon, he was the son of a shoemaker who died in 1794; leaving Richard's mother struggling to support her three children on the income from running a small shop. At the age of six he went for free education to the local Church of England school, then at the age of twelve he left school for a seven-year apprenticeship to a tinsmith in Plymouth.\n\nIn 1813 he married, and shortly afterwards the couple moved to Holborn Hill in London where he found work as a tinsmith. Jane Carlile gave birth to five children, three of whom survived.\n\nSome time after 1829, Carlile met Eliza Sharples and she became his common law wife. Together they had at least four children.\n\n \nHis interest in politics was kindled first by economic conditions in the winter of 1816 when Carlile was put on short-time work by his employer creating serious problems for the family: \"I shared the general distress of 1816 and it was this that opened my eyes.\" He began attending political meetings where speakers like Henry Hunt complained that only three men in a hundred had the vote, and was also influenced by the publications of William Cobbett.\n\nAs a way of making a living he sold the writings of parliamentary reformers such as Tom Paine on the streets of London, often walking \"thirty miles for a profit of eighteen pence\". In April 1817 he formed a publishing business with the printer William Sherwin and rented a shop in Fleet Street. To make political texts such as Paine's books \"The Rights of Man\" and the \"Principles of Government\" available to the poor he split them into sections which he sold as small pamphlets, similarly publishing \"The Age of Reason\" and \"Principles of Nature\". He issued unauthorized copies of Southey's \"Wat Tyler\" and after the radical William Hone's arrest in May, he reissued the parody of parts of the Book of Common Prayer for which Hone was to be tried, then was himself arrested in August and held without charge until Hone was acquitted in December.\n\nHe took on distributing the banned Radical weekly \"The Black Dwarf\" at a time when the government was prosecuting publishers: \"The Habeas Corpus Act being suspended ... all was terror and alarm, but I take credit to myself in defeating the effect of these two Acts upon the Press... Of imprisonment I made sure, but I felt inclined to court it than to shrink from it\".\n\nCarlile then brought out a radical journal, \"Sherwin's Political Register\", which reported political meetings and included extracts from books and poems by supporters of the reform movement such as Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. The popularity of this helped to soon bring his profit from his publishing venture to £50 a week.\n\nCarlile was one of the scheduled main speakers at the reform meeting on 16 August 1819 at St. Peter's Fields in Manchester. Just as Henry Hunt was about to speak, the crowd was attacked by the yeomanry in what became known as the Peterloo massacre. Carlile escaped and was hidden by radical friends before he caught the mail coach to London and published his eyewitness account, giving the first full report of what had happened, in \"Sherwin's Weekly Political Register\" of 18 August 1819. His placards proclaimed \"Horrid Massacres at Manchester\".\n\nThe government responded by closing \"Sherwin's Political Register\", confiscating the stock of newspapers and pamphlets. Carlile changed the name to \"The Republican\" and in its issue of 27 August 1819 demanded that \"The massacre... should be the daily theme of the Press until the murderers are brought to justice... Every man in Manchester who avows his opinions on the necessity of reform, should never go unarmed – retaliation has become a duty, and revenge an act of justice.\"\n\nCarlile was prosecuted for blasphemy, blasphemous libel and sedition for publishing material that might encourage people to hate the government in his newspaper, and for publishing Tom Paine's \"Common Sense\", \"The Rights of Man\" and the \"Age of Reason\" (which criticised the Church of England). In October 1819 he was found guilty of blasphemy and seditious libel and sentenced to three years in Dorchester Gaol with a fine of £1,500. When he refused to pay the fine, his premises in Fleet Street were raided and his stock was confiscated. While he was in jail he continued to write articles for \"The Republican\" which was now published by Carlile's wife Jane, and thanks to the publicity it now outsold pro-government newspapers such as \"The Times\".\n\nTo curb newspapers the government had raised the ½d tax on newspapers first imposed in 1712 to 3½d in 1797 then 4d in 1815. From December 1819 it set a minimum price of 7d and further restrictions. At a time when workers earned less than 10 shillings (120d.) a week this made it hard for them to afford radical newspapers, and publishers tried various strategies to evade the tax. Groups would pool their resources in reading societies and subscription societies to purchase a book or journal in common, and frequently read it aloud to one another as was the case with James Wilson.\n\nBy 1821, Carlile was a declared atheist (having previously been a Deist) and published his \"Address to Men of Science\", in favour of materialism and education. In the same year Jane Carlile was in turn sentenced to two years imprisonment for seditious libel, and her place as publisher was taken by Richard Carlile's sister, Mary. Within six months she was imprisoned for the same offence. The process was repeated with eight of his shop workers, and over 150 men and women were sent to prison for selling \"The Republican\". Carlile's sentence ended in 1823 but he was immediately arrested and returned to prison for not paying his £1,500 fine, so the process continued until he was eventually released on 25 November 1825. In the next edition of \"The Republican\" he expressed the hope that his long confinement would result in the freedom to publish radical political ideas. An example of the support he received from around the country is the £1.5.1 sent to him in Dorchester jail by forty working men in the West Yorkshire village of Hunslet, accompanied by a noble letter on behalf of those \"few Friends to Truth and Justice\".\n\nHe then published further journals, \"The Lion\" which campaigned against child labour and \"The Promptor\". He argued that \"equality between the sexes\" should be the objective of all reformers, and in 1826 published \"Every Woman's Book\" advocating birth control and the sexual emancipation of women. Cobbett denounced this book as \"so filthy, so disgusting, so beastly, as to shock even the lewdest men and women\".\n\nCarlile was an advocate of the Christ myth theory. He did not believe that Jesus existed. He debated Unitarian minister John Relly Beard in \"The Republican\", 1826.\n\nHe joined up with the radical and sceptical clergyman Robert Taylor and set out on an \"infidel home missionary tour\" which reached Cambridge on Thursday 21 May 1829 and caused a considerable upset to the University of Cambridge where a young Charles Darwin was a second-year student.\n\nAt their meeting in Bolton, Lancashire, Carlile met Eliza Sharples, who was to become his long term mistress.\n\nCarlile then opened a ramshackle building on the south bank of the River Thames, the Blackfriars Rotunda, and in widespread public unrest in July 1830 this became a gathering place for republicans and atheists. Taylor staged infidel melodramas, preaching outrageous sermons which got him dubbed \"The Devil's Chaplain\". Thousands of copies of these sermons were circulated in a seditious publication, \"The Devil's Pulpit\".\n\nIn 1831 he was jailed, under the charge of seditious libel, given two and a half years for writing an article in support of agricultural labourers campaigning against wage cuts and advising the strikers to regard themselves as being at war with the government. He left prison deeply in debt, and government fines had taken from him the finances needed to publish newspapers.\n\nHis political and social opinions never altered, but his philosophy underwent a change in the 1830s. In 1837 H. Robinson published the results of his later thinking in the book \"Extraordinary Conversion and Public Declaration of Richard Carlile of London to Christianity\".\n\nIn 1834, he was tried for creating a public nuisance, when he displayed two effigies in the windows of his shop at 62 Fleet Street, one in blue representing a broker titled \"Temporal broker\" and another dressed as a bishop titled \"Spiritual broker\". A large group of people were often gathered there, impeding traffic and causing quarrels. He was found guilty, but judgment was respited.\n\nAfter living for some years in extreme poverty in Enfield, Carlile returned to Fleet Street in 1842, dying there the following year. He donated his body for medical research. Large numbers of people attended his funeral in Kensal Green Cemetery on Sunday 26 February 1843, where his sons protested at the Christian burial rite being administered in the common grave he was being buried in - citing that he \"passed his life in opposition to all priestcraft.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252814", "title": "Shego", "text": "Shego\n\nShego is a fictional character from Disney's animated television series \"Kim Possible\", voiced by Nicole Sullivan. The character, ever since her first appearance in the pilot episode, \"Crush\" appears as Dr. Drakken's sidekick, though in some episodes acts as a mercenary for other villains. She is one of the franchise's main antagonists, and one of its most recurring characters. She made her live-action debut appearance in the 2019 film \"Kim Possible\", who is portrayed by Taylor Ortega.\n\nShego is one of the most mature characters in the franchise; unlike most other \"Kim Possible\" villains, she is not afflicted with megalomania or narcissism. However, despite her generally rational and sane demeanor, she is frequently impatient and quick to anger, especially when she feels that someone is being obnoxious or stupid; her brother, Hego, once summed her up as a \"cranky smart-mouth, prone to excessive violence.\"\n\nAs a villain, Shego is dedicated to her work, but often appears unmotivated and unambitious, dividing her free time between lounging in Drakken's lair reading villain magazines, filing her clawed gloves, and visiting spa resorts. For the most part, she does not initiate any schemes of her own, instead preferring to assist others as an enforcer or infiltrator. Despite being one of the smartest villains (or perhaps because of this fact), she generally prefers direct tactics—often involving physical force or intimidation—instead of high technology gadgets and overly complicated schemes. Because of her effectiveness as a sidekick, Shego appears to be well respected among the villain community, as some of them have broken her out of prison in order to enlist her assistance; nevertheless, Shego has nothing but contempt for the franchise's other villains.\n\nDespite her fearsome persona, Shego is one of the few antagonists in the franchise who have a moral compass: she has expressed concern over cruelty to animals and pauses at the thought of stealing a wheelchair from a handicapped boy, stating that it is a low act even for villains such as Drakken; however, she usually puts aside her misgivings once a plan appears to be working out. Shego has never actually killed anyone on the show, though she has demonstrated a callous disregard for human life; once, while partnered with Motor Ed, who earlier commented on Shego's \"appetite for destruction\", she excitedly remarked that the shockwave resulting from a high-powered rocket reaching full speed would \"doom the world to chaos!\"\n\nShego is a conventionally attractive young woman, with long black hair, an athletic build, sharp jawline, and slanted bright green eyes. She stands about a half foot taller than Kim. Her exact age remains unknown, though it was stated that she was in her early-to-mid 20s and it was revealed that she is a college graduate (unspecified degree in child development).\n\nAs a result of being struck by a glowing, rainbow colored comet as a child (see below) her skin has a pale green tinge. Her signature costume is a green and black full-body catsuit with matching gloves and boots, arranged in a harlequin's dazzle pattern. The gloves are tipped with metal claws, which she has occasionally been seen filing to keep sharp. On the occasions when Shego has been seen to wear different outfits, they typically follow the same color scheme as her signature outfit. In the \"Kim Possible\" movie \"A Sitch In Time: Future Story\", Shego conquers Middleton and she wears the same color with a matching black cape.\n\nShego is an expert in all kinds of fields, with infiltration and sabotage as her specialties. She possesses extensive martial arts training and impressive fitness and agility, rivaling the skills displayed by her nemesis Kim Possible. Her attack is also enhanced by metal claws on her gloves, and on occasion she has used her claw-like fingernails to similar effect. She is often seen filing them.\n\nShego is endowed with a unique superpower: the ability to generate green, flame-like bolts of glowing energy from her hands. This energy can be used to heat or melt anything she touches, or fired as a directed energy attack ranging from laser precision to a destructive blast. Originally, Disney described Shego's green flames as being purely concussive in nature, although in later episodes she was shown using her flames to burn or melt things. These powers were first stated by Disney as being generated by her gloves, making them a weapon rather than a superpower. However, this fact was retroactively changed during the show's second season, when these abilities were revealed to be a true superpower resulting from exposure to a rainbow-hued comet which also empowered her four brothers.\n\nIn addition to her energy attack, Shego appears to possess superhuman durability that allows her to survive situations of calamitous destruction that would probably kill other characters. In the film \"\", she was kicked into a live electrical signal tower, which shocked her and then proceeded to collapse on top of her. She came out of the incident with slightly torn clothes and frazzled hair.\n\nAt some unknown point prior to the start of the series, a rainbow-colored comet smashed into Shego's childhood tree house, and endowed her and her four brothers with super powers. She then became a hero who, alongside her four brothers, defended Go City against a number of villains as the superhero group Team Go. Shego eventually left the team for reasons that were never fully specified, but anecdotal evidence suggests there were three primary reasons: a fascination with villainy, crankiness, and irritation with her brothers. At some point, she abandoned her family and their quest for justice for a life as a mercenary-for-hire.\n\nIt is unknown what happened with Shego right after leaving her family, but from the beginning of the series Shego has been, for the most part, in the employ of Dr. Drakken as his sidekick and enforcer. It is during this stage of her life in which the series mostly revolves, leading her and Drakken to multiple confrontations against Kim Possible. Throughout the series, Shego is repeatedly defeated by Kim Possible and sent back to jail. She is (as previously mentioned) a formidable fighter and gets the better of Kim Possible a few times, whereupon her successes are usually stopped by Ron (often accidentally), Rufus, or, on occasion, bungling from Drakken or interference from his machinery.\n\nIn the second season, one of the most notable events involving Shego was her reunion with her brothers; she had to team up with her rival Kim to retrieve their powers, which had been stolen by an old enemy of hers, Aviarius. This was the first time the show took the time to detail bits of Shego's past, delving into her previously unknown background as a once-upon-a-time teenage heroine herself.\n\nA notable curiosity in the series, Shego is the only villain who is never given all of her basic characteristics: she lacks a common name—being known only as Shego throughout the show's run—and her age is also difficult to place. (At times, she seems to be only slightly older than Kim Possible, enjoying hip-hop music, fast cars, and handsome men; she critiques the heroine on her fashion and dating choices and is found attractive by both Ron and Senor Senior Junior, who are both of a high school-college age. Still at other times she seems to be quite a bit older, having—or perhaps faking—a complex college degree in child development, dating Mister Barkin, and being characterized by Ron as \"older, like, a lot older!\" Of course, this also comes in the same scene in \"Clean Slate\" where Shego tries to convince an amnesiac Kim that she was a senior while the heroine was a freshman.)\n\nDuring the fourth season, Shego’s character went through some development which pointed to the possibility that she may have been growing tired of her established role as a villainous sidekick. She walked out on two separate capers, and on two occasions she actually \"saved\" Kim's life. Shego states her reason for doing so is because nobody is allowed to kill Kim, except for her. Finally, at the series' end, she and Drakken team up with Kim and Ron to save the world from an alien invasion. Because of this, she is greeted as a heroine once again.\n\nShego has a powerful rivalry with Kim on the battlefield, which is sometimes kept at a \"professional\" context, but usually involves a few insults. This rivalry, however, progressed along the series, becoming more and more personal for both fighters.\n\nLike Bonnie, Shego talks down to Kim as if she were a child, often referring to her by the diminutive \"Kimmie\" or nicknames like \"Princess\" or \"Pumpkin\", as well as putting down both her appearance and wardrobe. However, Kim doesn't seem to be quite as affected by Shego's insults as with Bonnie's, and her retorts have a better effect against Shego. Over time, and despite their rivalry (or possibly because of it), Shego has developed a professional respect which she often shows for Kim as a rival and a fighter, and is less than impressed when she manages to ruin Drakken's scheme. In some instances they share a bond, especially when they are stuck in the same \"sitch\", usually leading to small and almost friendly conversations.\n\nThis relationship has somehow grown to be much more personal for Shego, also indicating a gradual development in her personality. In certain situations, Kim and Shego have teamed up against common enemies, and Shego has gone as far as to save Kim from other enemies, claiming that only she has the right to destroy her. It was even demonstrated during the events of \"Stop Team Go\" that they have the potential to be great friends, if only Shego weren't irritable (Shego even reveals to have been wanting to tell Kim something she couldn't while evil, though what this was is never revealed). In the episode \"Mad Dogs & Aliens\" Shego goes so far as to both rescue Kim from a gigantic alien who has incapacitated her, and to summon Ron and Kim's little brothers for assistance. At one point during \"Stop Team Go\", Kim referred to Shego as \"like a big sister.\" (to which Ron responds, \"Yes, a big sister who used to punch and kick you, AND MEAN IT!\") In the two-part series finale, \"Graduation\", when Shego saves Kim, the latter herself teasingly states, \"See, you \"do\" care.\" and the former does not deny it.\n\nDr. Drakken is Shego's usual employer; she has been stated to be his sidekick. They have worked together for most of their schemes, but she rarely shows much concern over him even though he claims that he likes to think of them as some kind of \"evil family\". Their relationship teeters between a familiar, cooperative interaction and annoyance or frustration with each other.\n\nAs a sidekick, she started out in the series being respectful towards Drakken. As the franchise progressed, she began to develop a stronger personality and to openly show contempt for him. Eventually, Shego became the dominant one, and began threatening him with violence if he stepped over the line with her.\n\nShe is rarely taken aback when Dr. Drakken's plans are foiled – going so far as to chide him for making overly complex or unconventional plans. On the few occasions that such schemes appear to be working, she has been seen to be pleasantly surprised and appears to be happy for his minor successes. Even though Shego's tolerance for Drakken and his failure-prone evil schemes has steadily decreased, she still remains in his service, usually without much reluctance unless she wants a vacation from him or sees a better opportunity. In fact, she reacts badly when he twice replaces her with new sidekicks (Warmonga and Frugal Lucre). As poorly as she treats him, Shego sees her place as being in Drakken's employ and has proven to actually care for him.\n\nJunior is one of the few characters that has managed to earn Shego's respect. Señor Senior Sr. hired Shego to teach his son Junior the finer points of villainy, and although the training practically started with complications, Junior eventually proved to be an apt pupil, and Shego a capable instructor. They may be in mutual pursuit of evil schemes, but their relationship seems to be based on a friendly teacher-student dynamic, although her loyalty towards him is rather questionable.\n\nShego is unusually cooperative and patient with Junior, and he is one of the few people who can bring out her softer side. Junior also sought Shego's help while developing a scheme on his own for impressing his father, and Shego willingly assisted. Together they showed the potential for being a formidable team, somewhat matching Kim and Ron. And unlike Drakken, Dementor, and the like, Shego has never struck or blasted Junior, a mark of trust from the cranky and violence-prone woman.\n\nShego has four brothers: Hego, Mego, and a set of twins who were never identified in the first episode, but were later revealed to be called Wego. All of them granted with unique super-powers like her, which Hego referred to as a \"Go-Team-Glow\" in the episode \"Go Team Go!\". With them, she used to be part of Team Go. Her reasons for leaving the team and turning to evil are never fully examined, though two different views are offered: Hego claims that the more Team Go fought against evil, the more Shego came to like evil; while Shego strongly suggests that she left not because of any particular calling to villainy, but for the fact that her brothers' behavior and dysfunctions drove her away.\n\nShego has a huge resentment towards her brothers' attitude, finding them incompetent, argumentative, and irritating, and their dysfunctional and annoying relationship was part of the reason she abandoned Team Go's fight for justice to pursue evil. Her brothers, on the other hand, are fairly oblivious to the fact their sister has turned to a life of villainy; Hego has called her a \"cranky smart mouth, prone to excessive violence\", but still considers Shego to be good unconditionally (this is somewhat supported by her moral compass and camraderies). Although the family has disagreements, in the episode \"Go Team Go\", Shego deserts Dr. Drakken to help her brothers regain their powers from minor villain \"Avarius\".\n\nShego apparently provided the brains and initiative of Team Go. It was through her efforts they kept focused and organized as a superhero team: when she left, Team Go collapsed into ineffectual bickering and soon disbanded. When they briefly, fully regrouped in \"Stop Team Go\" they quickly regained their fighting effectiveness.\n\nDespite the fact that Shego claims to dislike her siblings and even though she would never admit it, it was strongly suggested that Shego still has a sense of familial love for them, as pointed out by both Kim and Drakken.\n\nShego first encounters Motor Ed in the episode \"Steal Wheels\". She finds him extremely annoying because of his sexist attitudes and incessant attempts to hit on her. Her attempts to discourage him (up to and including attacking him with her energy blasts) only increase his infatuation.\n\nWhen Momma Lipsky learns that Ed has been incarcerated, she brings him to her son Drew (Doctor Drakken, who she is not aware is also a villain) with the hopes of straightening him out. Shego finds their plan to steal a boy's wheelchair to be beyond even her low standards, and while she does allow the plan to occur, she takes no part in the theft, chiding them both for being particularly cruel and/or idiotic.\n\nIn the episode \"Car Alarm\", Motor Ed breaks Shego out of prison in hope that she would assist him in his latest scheme. She reluctantly agrees to help him. Motor Ed turns a stolen rocket into a vehicle capable of going fast enough to cause devastation wherever it goes. In the end, Shego finds out she was just an \"accessory\" and proceeds to assault him, with the end result of both falling out of the rocket-car and into a river, effectively foiling their own plans.\n\nIn addition to the stock edition of Shego, her character and design has been modified on a number of occasions in order to fit in with specific plot devices and episodes.\n\nIn the multipart episode \"A Sitch In Time\" (Aired in the US as a stand-alone TV movie), a future version of Shego was shown as the only Kim Possible villain ever to successfully take over the world.\n\nUsing the \"Tempus Simia\", a mystical idol with the power to create portals through space-time, Shego, acting on the advice of her future self, managed to take over the world by making fruitful financial and criminal investments to strategically separating Kim and Ron, thus splitting up Team Possible and decreasing their effectiveness. This way, they failed to stop Shego from obtaining the idol and dragging them into the future, leaving the world for her to dominate.\n\nTwenty years in the future, Shego, now known as The Supreme One, establishes Middleton as her capital, renaming it \"Shegoton\", and transforming Club Banana into \"Club Shego\". She has dissenters brainwashed in special totalitarian facilities (including and particularly the former high school) and everyone, aside from a small band of resistance fighters, wears a dress code based on Shego's green and black costume.\n\nAlthough mostly the same, this version of Shego appeared to be much crueler and more evil than her present self as well as more criminally sophisticated, using her subordinates (other villains) to fight her enemies instead of doing it herself (\"the Supreme One always delegates!\"). She proves to be a seemingly capable Overlord in her delegations, capturing all of the rebels as well as Kim, Ron, and Rufus by sending her minions after them (Killigan, Drakken, and Monkey Fist). It was only when she began listening to Drakken's inane \"tips\" about how to gloat and boast that she becomes distracted, allowing the heroes to destroy the time monkey, undoing all of her victories and erasing her from history in the process.\n\nIn the season 3 episode \"Rewriting History\", A young woman named Miss Go helps Bartholomew Lipsky (ancestor of Drew \"Drakken\" Lipsky) to steal an experimental device from Professor DeMenz (ancestor of Professor Dementor). In the process, she permanently sullies the good name of Miriam \"Mim\" Possible (ancestor to Kim), who is forced to go into hiding in shame. While this Miss Go lacks any apparent super-powers, she is still a remarkably gifted thief and hand-to-hand combatant, even while fighting in period-appropriate attire such as a corset, broad hat, and billowing skirt. She fights Miriam to a standstill while moving throughout the Middleton World's Fair, and eventually manages to escape with Lipsky.\n\nWhether or not Miss Go ever truly existed is left unclear, as the episode ends in the trope of \"It was all a dream;\" only to show up in references in following episodes such as \"Emotion Sickness\" that at least some aspects, such as the existence of Jonathan Stoppable and the Taco Stand were probably real.\n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"Stop Team Go\", Shego temporarily lost her crankiness to an enhanced version of Jack Hench's Attitudinator, wielded by an old enemy of Team Go, the techno-powered villainess Electronique. Electronique's plan had originally been to turn all of the members of Team Go evil, but since Shego was already evil, she was turned good instead.\n\nAssuming the alias Miss Go, Shego used her degree in child development to land a job as a substitute teacher at Middleton High School, taking over one of Kim's classes. As Miss Go, Shego is a genuinely kind, caring and even airheadedly girly person who is into shopping and romantic movies. She has a lot in common with Kim and the two quickly become close friends, with Kim going so far as to describe her as being \"like a big sister.\" Shego also attracts the attention of fellow substitute teacher Steve Barkin, and they enjoyed a brief romance.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Shego was accidentally transformed back to her original self by Ron, and the Attitudinator is damaged beyond repair. Right after this, Shego rejoins with Drakken, who spent the episode failing to get a pickle jar open without her (she eventually opens the jar with great upset, to which Drakken retorts, \"Oh, sure, after \"I loosened it!\"\"). Towards the episode's close, she is seen looking wistfully at a strip of photo booth pictures of Kim and herself, suggesting that she might have regrets about losing their brief friendship; she then burns the pictures as Drakken approaches, apparently because she did not want him to see them. Later during the credits Barkin tries to win her back; though she considers it at the beginning, as soon as he started to sing, she used the lair's defense system on him.\n\nInitially, Shego was meant to be \"just\" Dr. Drakken's sidekick, designed with green and black as what the creators considered to be known as \"bad colors\". However, it was after hearing Nicole Sullivan's performance as Shego that they started to develop her unique relationship with Drakken, as Nicole portrayed Shego as sarcastic and smarter than Drakken, which prevailed along the series as trademark, even though the characters' voice actors had already worked together in \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command\". Originally, Shego wasn't included in the first versions of the pilot episode of \"Kim Possible\" (\"Crush\"), but was added in later versions of it.\n\nShego has become the most popular villain of the series as well as one of its most popular characters, and also one of the main character’s most popular love interests among fan art and fan fiction. Her popularity led the authors of the series to keep her, alongside Drakken, as one of the most recurring characters, even though they had intended to work less with them; the duo are thus regarded as Kim Possible's arch-nemeses.\n\nBesides being one of the most recurring characters of the franchise, Shego is one of the few characters who has had appearances outside the series. She appeared in the \"\" crossover episode entitled “Rufus”, again as Drakken's sidekick in his attempt to kidnap Stitch. She also appeared in almost every \"Kim Possible\" video game, most notably in \"\", where she is a playable character alongside Kim and covers up half of the adventure. For gameplay purposes, her powers in said game are portrayed as being electromagnetic rather than thermal.\n\nShego has proven wildly popular with fans, and as inspiration to other pop-culture icons. As of 2019, she featured as a main character or even love-interest in over three thousand fictions at FanFiction.Net. She is also the cover-girl image for the trope of \"Dark Action Girl\" on TV Tropes website, serving as an archetype of the character.\n"}

Since the division of Korea it has only carried trains for a brief period during 2007/8. The line originally connected to the Gyeongwon Line running from Gyeongseong (present-day Seoul) to Wonsan. \n\nIt began running in 1929 between Anbyon and Hupgok, and was extended to Yangyang in 1937. Plans had called for it to be extended south to Pohang, where it would have connected with the Donghae Nambu Line. However, this extension was not completed before the fall of the Japanese regime in 1945, and since then the tracks have been idle.\n\nWith increasing talk of peaceful Korean reunification beginning in the 1990s, there have been various efforts to reopen the Donghae Bukbu Line, together with the Gyeongui Line in the west. An opened Donghae Bukbu Line would provide ready land access to the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, which is open to South Korean tourists. After the completion of reconstruction on the cross-border section between Jejin in South Korea and Gamho in North Korea, the initial test run was set for May 25, 2006, but North Korean military authorities cancelled the plans a day ahead of the scheduled event. On the South Korean side, Korail opened Jejin Station in 2006 and has maintained some rolling stock for a trial run.\n\nAt a meeting held in Pyongyang, North Korea, on April 22, 2007, North and South Korea agreed to restart the project. On May 17, 2007, the first train to cross the border between North and South Korea in over 50 years entered South Korea from the North, from Kaesŏng to Dorasan on the Gyeongui line (whose northern section is known as the P'yŏngbu line). More than one million civilian visitors crossed the DMZ until the route was closed following the shooting death of a 53-year-old South Korean tourist in July 2008. After a joint investigation was rebuffed by the North, the Republic of Korea government suspended tours to the resort. Since then the resort, and the Donghae Bukbu Line, have effectively been closed by the North.\n\nDuring the efforts to re-open the cross-border section, the South Korean government has taken up the idea of a railway all along the east coast from Pohang to the North Korean border, with a primary aim to serve freight traffic that could eventually access the Trans-Siberian Railway. As part of the project, plans foresaw to connect the end of the Yeongdong Line in Gangneung with Jejin by long, single-track, non-electrified line for , effectively re-building the Donghae Bukbu Line on a new alignment.\n\nThree years later, the project re-surfaced as a domestic project. On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. The section from Gangneung to Sokcho forms a part of the plan as a line for , and may see KTX service.\n\n"}

It is the first of seven direct-to-video films produced by Tapestry Films to star the Olsens.\n\nTeenage identical twin sisters, Melanie and Allyson Porter are 13 years old, and their only concerns are boys, boys and boys. Knowing they need to broaden their horizons and see the world, their parents send them to Paris during their Spring Break school vacation, to live with their estranged Grandpa Edward who is the U.S. Ambassador to France. Expecting a fun time with their grandfather, they instead end up living day-to-day via an itinerary with his no-nonsense assistant, Jeremy, since Edward is always too busy and has no time to spend with them. They also learn some harsh rules while staying at his swanky mansion, which includes no loud music, no jumping on the bed, and having to be dressed appropriately for dinner every night without being a minute late.\n\nInstead of exploring and shopping, Jeremy takes the girls to various museums and posh restaurants, which they find anything but interesting. However, while out for lunch one afternoon, they meet and befriend Brigitte, a beautiful French fashion model who agrees to show them the great sights of Paris. They also soon fall for two charming French boys, Jean and Michel and find various ways to ditch Jeremy so that they can spend time cruising around the city on mopeds with the boys.\n\nAbsorbing all the sights and sounds of Paris, Melanie and Allyson end up in police custody, along with Jean and Michel, for trespassing on private property. To their dismay, the girls are hastily forbidden by Grandpa Edward to see the boys again. So they challenge the French Foreign Minister, Monsieur De Beauvoir, at a banquet, and manage to convince him to accept an important proposal that was established by their grandfather, concerning clean drinking water for the Embassy. This puts Melanie and Allyson back in Grandpa Edward's good graces, and he allows them to once again see Jean and Michel – even allowing all four of them to attend a dance together where they have their first kiss.\n\nFinally, when the time comes for the girls to return home, Grandpa Edward decides to take a much-needed break from his ambassadorial duties, and accompany them; the intention being to spend time with his family (whom he hasn't seen for a long time), back in the United States.\n\n"}

{"id": "2252835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252835", "title": "Nicolas Hayek", "text": "Nicolas Hayek\n\nNicolas George Hayek (19 February 1928 – 28 June 2010), was a Lebanese-American Swiss businessman, co-founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board of The Swatch Group, with principal headquarters in Biel/Bienne.\n\nHayek was born, the second of three children, to a Lebanese mother and a Lebanese-American father, both from Greek Orthodox Christian Lebanese families with roots in Lebanon's Northern Governorate of El-Koura. His father was trained as a dentist at Loyola University Chicago. His older sister Mona was the wife of the Lebanese architect Joseph Philippe Karam. His younger brother Sam, also a Swiss citizen, was a former CEO of the Swiss group Sibra (Biere Cardinal).\n\nHayek studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the University of Lyon.\n\nIn 1950, Hayek met Marianne Mezger in Beirut, a young Swiss au pair and daughter of Swiss industrialist Eduard Mezger. They married in 1951 and moved to Switzerland. They had two children, Nayla and G. Nicolas (Nick) Jr. In 1964, the family moved to Meisterschwanden, a village 35 kilometres west of Zürich. Hayek lived there for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 2010, Hayek was ranked the world's 232nd richest person with an estimated net worth of $US3.9 billion.\n\nHayek was awarded the title of Doctor honoris causa of Law and Economics of the Faculty of \"Beni Culturali\" of the University of Bologna (Italy) in June 1998, after being awarded doctor honoris causa of Law and Economics of the University of Neuchatel in 1996.\n\nHayek started his business career working as an actuary for Swiss Re. He then assumed briefly the management of the engineering firm owned by his then ailing father-in-law, Eduard Mezger. He soon relinquished this position to search for an opportunity \"to learn something new every day\".\n\nIn 1963, Hayek founded his own management consulting firm, the Zurich-based Hayek Engineering. Hayek made his mark quickly on the Swiss and European business scene by consulting and effecting successful turnarounds at several of the largest European multinationals. One of his management credos was: \"The rarest resources are entrepreneurial types in top management.\" By 1979, Hayek Engineering had over 300 clients in 30 countries. Hayek was Chairman of the Board and CEO of Hayek Engineering from its founding until his death.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Hayek was asked by a group of Swiss bankers to oversee a liquidation of ASUAG and SSIH, two Swiss watch-making firms which were in turmoil due to heavy competition from Japanese watch manufacturers such as Seiko and Citizen Watch. Hayek believed that the Swiss watch manufacturing industry could remain competitive and that ASUAG/SSIH could recover after a restructuring of operations and a repositioning of the different brands.\n\nHayek identified problems in products, policies and distribution as well as outdated leadership that needed to be changed. \"ASUAG for example owned more than 100 separate companies – some big, some small, some modern, some backward. Most of these companies did their own marketing, R&D and assembly. It was crazy.\" \n\nHayek invested heavily in automation and the standardization of parts and tooling. This produced economies of scale and improved quality. Production was centralized, and parts were designed to be interchangeable.\n\nThe restructuring of the companies coincided with the invention of the Swatch watch which used only 51 parts, as opposed to the nearly 100 parts needed to make a traditional wristwatch without compromising on accuracy or quality and thus was cheaper to manufacture. The Swatch watch helped the Swiss watch industry reconquer a large share of the lower end of the watch market which it had lost to Japanese makers. Although the colorful plastic watch became quickly known for its flamboyant marketing, Hayek always emphasized that the Swatch watch was first and foremost a technological breakthrough.\n\nHaving spearheaded the reorganization of ASUAG and SSIH for more than four years, finally bringing about their merger, Hayek, with a group of Swiss investors, took over a majority shareholding in the new group in 1985. He became chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer in 1986. The merged company was initially named Société Suisse de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie, or SMH. It later changed its name to Swatch Group.\n\nHayek played a decisive role in the recovery of the Swatch Group with its watch brands Swatch, Blancpain, Omega, Longines, Rado, Tissot, Certina, Mido, Hamilton, Pierre Balmain, Calvin Klein, Flik Flak, Breguet and Lanco. The strategies he developed in the early 1980s led to the success of the entire Swiss watch industry and regained its leading position worldwide since 1984.\n\nHayek is also credited with having a fundamental role in the creation of the Smart Car, a small European car created for inner city use by Mercedes-Benz. Original names for the car revolved around the Swatch name — and even today aspects of the car such as its interchangeable body panels are clearly linked with the Swatch philosophy. The name \"Smart\" was derived by adding the first letters of Swatch and Mercedes to the word \"art\".\n\nIn 1995, Hayek's daughter Nayla joined the Board of Directors of the Swatch Group and in early 2010, she became co-Vice-Chairman of the Board. In 2003, his son Nick Jr. became the CEO of the Swatch Group. Hayek remained Chairman of the Board of the Swatch Group until his death. On 30 June 2010, two days after his death, the Board elected Nayla to replace him as Chairman.\n\nHayek died unexpectedly on 28 June 2010 of cardiac arrest during work at the Swatch Group headquarters in Biel.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2252849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252849", "title": "Subhuman (song)", "text": "Subhuman (song)\n\n\"Subhuman\" is a 1995 song written, recorded and produced by alternative rock band Garbage, and was originally released as an international b-side on \"Vow\", Garbage's debut single. That song had earlier been pressed as a limited edition 7\" vinyl in the United Kingdom for the purposes of launching the band; when it came to re-releasing \"Vow\", Mushroom Records felt that \"Subhuman\" was strong enough to be issued as an A-side to follow up \"Vow\". A last-minute decision was made to switch the songs. \"Vow\" was relegated to bonus track on the CD single.\n\n\"Subhuman\" was released as the band's second single exclusively in the United Kingdom, and it gave Garbage their first chart appearance, peaking at #50 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was promoted by a press junket organised by the record label on a boat sailing down London's River Thames, and attracted media attention for the distinctive rubber packaging of the vinyl format.\n\n\"Subhuman\" was also used by the label as an opportunity to massively raise general awareness of Garbage and as an advertising campaign to brand the \"G\" logo by promoting the single release with plain white flyers, stickers, carrier bags, t-shirts and subway posters emblazoned with the band's \"G\" logo. \"Subhuman\" was never intended to be an album cut, and was not included on the standard editions of the band's debut album, \"Garbage\" which was released later that year. The single was excluded from the 2007 greatest hits album \"Absolute Garbage\".\n\n\"Subhuman\" was written and recorded over the course of 1994 during sessions between band members Duke Erikson, Shirley Manson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig in either Marker's basement recording studio or at their own Smart Studios in Wisconsin university town Madison. The band has kept the story behind the song ambiguous, although Erikson has said that the lyric \"\"burn down all your idols\"\", the first line of the song \"pretty much sums it up\". The opening noise emerged from Vig accidentally wiring the mixing console to the air conditioner.\n\nMidway through the recording sessions for the band's debut album, the band's manager, Shannon O'Shea, secured the group an inclusion on \"Volume\", a compilation album and magazine title. However, the deadline given for accepting a track was only three days. The only song the band had completed in any shape or form was \"Vow\". After \"Volume\" was released in December 1994, \"Vow\" began to receive radio airplay from Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq, John Peel and Johnnie Walker, and record stores in the United Kingdom began to receive requests for a single that didn't yet exist. Garbage were still putting the finishing touches to their debut set, as well as extra tracks such as \"Subhuman\", which was still three months away from release. In the United Kingdom, the terms of the licensing deal regarding the inclusion of \"Vow\" on \"Volume\" meant that the track could only be released on a limited basis. \"Vow\" was issued in a 1,000 copy limited edition 7\" vinyl format packaged in an aluminium sleeve, which was designed by O'Shea along with the aluminium sleeve for \"Vow\". The single sold out in one day. Mushroom later licensed the single out to BMG who fully issued \"Vow\" in Europe, and to White Records, who released \"Vow\" in Australia and New Zealand in a limited edition format packaged in an embossed rubber wallet. \"Subhuman\" was released as the \"Vow\" b-side on both labels.\n\nMushroom's plan for releasing \"Vow\" in the limited metal sleeve had been to create an early buzz about the band and \"Vow\" by word-of-mouth, rather than by retail impact. For the follow-up, the label were concerned with maintaining the interest of the record buyers, as well as attracting interest from record chains. Mushroom manufactured advance discs to promote a re-release of \"Vow\" in the United Kingdom, but later decided to alter the single, so that the international b-side, \"Subhuman\", would be the title track. The label felt that \"Subhuman\" was a \"strong single.. to release in its own right\". \"Subhuman\" was to be a limited release as well, but manufactured in greater quantities to enable a greater retail impact than the first. Mushroom re-serviced the single to the media as a cassette featuring \"Subhuman\", \"#1 Crush\" (an album out-take) and \"Vow\".\n\nGarbage requested that their initial singles were to be packaged with a \"high-tech, design-led approach\", which led to the manufacture of the aluminium sleeve for \"Vow\". To follow it up, Mushroom's product manager originally wanted to create the sleeve for \"Subhuman\" from neoprene. Instead, he sourced a black plasticised rubber from a company in Germany to create the sleeve. Although it wasn't requested, the company manufactured the rubber wallets with lining and a flap to enclose the discs within. \"Subhuman\" was a bigger investment than the first single; the metal sleeve for \"Vow\" had cost 90p per unit to manufacture, \"Subhuman\" cost £2.00 per unit. Knowing that the dealer price was fixed at £1.36, Mushroom lost 64p on each. The company manufactured 3,000 copies of the sleeve in 7\" size, and a further 2,000 copies in CD-size (these were used as promos, and exported to Australia for their limited edition \"Vow\" CD single).\n\nMarketing trends over the 1990s had shown an increasing dominance of using branding to sell product, so Mushroom's marketing campaign for the launch of the band focused on branding the \"G\" logo onto the minds of music buyers. The logo would adorn the album cover and each upcoming single, as well as all upcoming promotional matter and point of sale displays. Upfront of the release date, Mushroom ran two teaser campaigns in the British music press. 10,000 A2 posters of simply the G logo were affixed to prime sites around the United Kingdom; another 10,000 were set up two weeks later which also included the band's name, the name of the single and the release information. Similar branded carrier bags and posters were distributed to independent retailers, flyers and stickers distributed to nightclubs, as well as branded t-shirts to key people. No music video was filmed for \"Subhuman\", instead, Mushroom serviced the video for \"Vow\" to music channels.\n\nTo support the release of \"Subhuman\" and launch the album, Mushroom organised the band's first fanzine press conference on July 25, on board a cruise sailing up and down the River Thames. The event hostted an exclusive album playback and a question and answer session to introduce the band, and gained music paper publicity for the release of the album. The boat set-off from Embankment Pier early, without the band on board, and had to return to pick them up (it was later pointed out and reported that the conference had taken place on the sister-ship to the \"Marchioness\", which had sank with loss of life a few years earlier).\n\nOn August 7, 1995 \"Subhuman\" was issued on the rubber-sleeved 7\" vinyl, and stickered CD single, both limited to 3,000 copies each. Some copies of the vinyl also came with a G-logo carrier bag. Both formats sold out in the first week. \"Subhuman\" debuted at #50 on the UK Singles Chart. In case of demand, Mushroom also manufactured an extra 2,000 copies of the 7\" in a simple black card sleeve. These made it into shops the following week, at the end of which \"Subhuman\" fell to #77.\n\n\n\nBoth \"Subhuman\" and \"#1 Crush\" were never intended to be included on the band's debut album, which was released in the United Kingdom in October 1995. Both tracks were however included as bonus tracks on the Japanese edition of \"Garbage\". In November, \"Subhuman\" was included on \"Rare Track Collection\", a five track sampler given away free by Virgin Megastores in France with purchases of the album. Towards the end of the following year, \"Subhuman\" b-side \"#1 Crush\" was remixed by Nellee Hooper for inclusion on the soundtrack album to Baz Luhrmann's \"Romeo + Juliet\". As the album opener, \"#1 Crush\" received massive airplay at alternative radio. At the start of 1997, \"#1 Crush\" hit #1 on the Modern Rock chart and stayed there for four weeks. Later the same year, limited two-disc edition of \"Garbage\" featuring \"Subhuman\" and three other b-sides was issued in Korea and Singapore. In 1998, \"Subhuman\" was included on \"Independent Access\", a CD sampler given away by Newbury Comics stores in the United States with purchases of Garbage's second album \"Version 2.0\".\n\nIn 2015, Garbage announced the 20th Anniversary Edition of their debut album with a free download of an extended version of \"Subhuman\" with all pre-orders. \"Subhuman\" was included on the deluxe edition of the reissue. \"I just don’t feel that everyone felt [\"Subhuman\"] was strong enough to put on the record\", Shirley Manson stated in 2015. \"In retrospect it’s a bit silly, because it’s fantastic. You make strange choices and you have to live by them\".\n\n\"Subhuman\" received a mostly positive response from music critics. Before the release of the single, \"Volume\" described the song as having a \"dark sensibility and bouts of Trent Reznor-esque depression\". Both \"Kerrang!\" and \"Melody Maker\" rated \"Subhuman\" as their \"Single of the Week\"; the former publication wrote, \"\"Subhuman\" crunches along on a thrilling, all consuming electro-rhythm-from-hell. Totally distinctive and utterly brilliant\" while the latter lengthily enthused, \"There are reminders of Curve, in the scowling, abrasive guitars, trussed down with a rubbery, mordantly funky rhythm programme. This is severely internal music, right inside your head, pulsing like a migraine, with Manson crowing like a dominatrix as she presides over some impending psychological breakdown\". \"Hot Press\" described \"Subhuman\" as \"hypnotic drum loops combined with a guitar overload... an industrial noise-feat\", adding that it was \"a great single\". \"Vox\" were equally positive, writing \"trashing a bloated, ego-fuelled but nameless icon, \"Subhuman\" is one of [Garbage's] darkest songs to date.\" \"NME\" were severely critical of \"Subhuman\", stating that the single was a disappointing follow up to \"Vow\": \"Garbage go and ruin it all by being hopelessly techno-gothic. The end result is a song plagued by its own earnestness... it more or less self-destructs.\"\n\nGarbage\n\n"}

Founded on 11 March 1912, it is the country's oldest active football club, which competes in the Bulgarian Parva Liga, the top flight of Bulgarian football.\n\nBotev is named after the Bulgarian national hero Hristo Botev. The club plays its home games at Botev 1912 Football Complex, located in the neighbourhood of Komatevo, while its stadium is under reconstruction.\n\nDuring its history, the club has won 2 Bulgarian championships, 3 Bulgarian Cups, 1 Bulgarian Supercup and 1 Balkans Cup. Botev has also reached the Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finals once. In addition, the club has been a runner-up in the domestic league twice and has reached the Bulgarian Cup final thirteen times. In the years before the Bulgarian championship was created, the team regularly participated in the local Plovdiv championship, claiming it six times.\n\nBotev Plovdiv was founded in 1912 and is the oldest still existing football club in Bulgaria. Stoyan Puhtev became president, Nenko Penelov was the vice-president, Petar Delev secretary and Tenyo Rusev steward. Rusev named it \"Botev\" in honor of the Bulgarian national hero Hristo Botev. Since then, the club's name has been changed for political reasons several times: Botev (1912–1946), DNV(1947–51), DNA (1952–57), SKNA (1957), Botev (1957–1968) and Trakia (1968–1989). The current name is \"Botev Plovdiv\". The club's colours, yellow and black, were adopted in 1917.\n\nIn 1920, the team won the unofficial football championship of Plovdiv. On August 30, 1925, the canaries played their first official international match against the Turkish Fenerbahçe. In the next year, the team led by the coach and captain Nikola Shterev, won the first official trophy, the Cup of Plovdiv.\n\nBotev Plovdiv became National League champions for the first time in 1929, winning the final against Levski Sofia. The canaries won with 1:0 the final game in Sofia. The goal scored Nikola Shterev. Key players during this period included Nikola Shterev, Stancho Prodanov, Vangel Kaundzhiev and Mihail Kostov, who also played for the national team.\n\nIn 1951, Botev Plovdiv joined the newly created Bulgarian A PFG. Despite being relegated in 1953 to the Bulgarian B PFG, in 1954 the club easily won promotion for the top division. 1956 was very successful for the team, which finished 3rd in the domestic league and qualified for the final of the Bulgarian Cup, where Botev faced Levski Sofia. The final match was lost by the canaries with 2:5.\n\nIn the next few years, the local municipality decided to build a new venue for the sports club. The construction for the sports complex, started on July 21, 1959 and was built in a period of two years. The new stadium was named Hristo Botev, in honor of the national hero. The sport venue was inaugurated with a friendly match between Botev and Steaua Bucureşti, which was won by the canaries with 3:0 in front of 20,000 spectators.\n\nIn 1961 Botev finished 3rd in the A PFG, for second time in the club's history. This championship also marked the first appearance of the club's most important player Dinko Dermendzhiev and the beginning of Botev's golden age. Dermendzhiev holds Botev's overall appearances record, playing in 447 matches for the club. Second is Viden Apostolov with 429 matches and third is Petar Zehtinski with 351. Botev's all-time leading scorer is also Dermendzhiev, who scored 194 goals at his period in the club. Kostadin Kostadinov is the Botev's second highest scorer with 106 goals and third is Atanas Pashev with 100 goals.\n\nUnder the leadership of Dinko Dermendzhiev, Botev won their first Bulgarian Cup in 1962, beating Dunav Rousse 3–0 at Vasil Levski National Stadium in Sofia on 12 August. In the 1962–63 season Botev reached the quarter-final of the Cup Winners' Cup by eliminating Steaua Bucureşti and Shamrock Rovers before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–5 on aggregate. In the same season the team finished runners-up in A PFG with 40 points, only 3 less than the first, Spartak Plovdiv.\n\nIn 1967 Botev became champions for the second time. The championship team featured several notable players, such as Viden Apostolov, Georgi Popov and Rayko Stoynov, with Vasil Spasov as head coach. Botev represented Bulgaria in the 1967–68 European Champions Cup where they lost in the first round to Rapid Bucureşti after 2:0 win in Plovdiv and 0–3 (a.e.t.) loss in Romania. A five years later, in 1972, the team became winner of the Balkans Cup for the first time, playing against Yugoslavian Velež Mostar after two spectacular final matches to take the cup.\n\nIn 1981, the club's forward Georgi Slavkov won the club's highest individual achievement, the European Golden Shoe after finishing as Europe's top domestic scorer with 31 goals. The same year, the team won its second Bulgarian Cup, after a win against Pirin Blagoevgrad. This period was very successful for the club. Botev finished 3rd in the A PFG, in 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 2nd in 1986. In this year the team finished with 41 points, only 2 less than the first, Beroe, in spite of the 8–1 win against Beroe in the direct match. Many of the club's most notable stars played around this time, such as Antim Pehlivanov, Dimitar Vichev, Atanas Pashev, Dimitar Mladenov, Zapryan Rakov, Blagoy Bangev and Petar Zehtinski were part of the rank and file of the notable Golden Team.\n\nAn important achievement of that period was the 1985 Cup Winners' Cup campaign, when Botev qualified for the second round of the tournament. The team secured a 2–0 victory against the German powerhouse Bayern Munich (with Klaus Augenthaler, Dieter Hoeneß, Søren Lerby, Lothar Matthäus and Jean-Marie Pfaff in their squad). On November 7, 1984, in front of more than 45,000 spectators at Plovdiv Stadium, Atanas Pashev and Kostadin Kostadinov scored for the win, but Botev were eliminated after losing 1:4 in the first-leg. Another memorable win is the 1:0 home victory over Barcelona in a Cup Winners' Cup first-leg in 1981.\n\nIn 1992, the club was bought by a conglomerate of brokers led by Hristo Alexandrov and Hristo Danov. They brought in players with experience in Bulgarian football, such as Nasko Sirakov, Bozhidar Iskrenov, Kostadin Vidolov and Borislav Mihaylov. In this period, Botev signed the first foreign player in the club's history, the Hungarian Roberto Szabay. These big investments however did not bring any significant results and the club only reached third place in the A PFG in 1993, 1994 and 1995.\n\nOn 19 March 1999 Botev was acquired by Dimitar Hristolov. This day marked the beginning of difficult years for the club. In the 2000–01 season, the team was relegated to B PFG, after playing 47 years in the A PFG. Botev spent one season in the second division and quickly returned to the top flight, but in 2004 the club was relegated for the second time. From 2005 to 2009 the club played in the A PFG, but in the second part of the league table.\n\nIn September 2009, Botev Plovdiv set an unusual record after fielding seven Italian players in the 1:2 away loss against Litex Lovech, becoming the first A PFG club to feature that many foreigners from the same nationality.\n\nOn 24 February 2010, Botev Plovdiv were administratively relegated from A PFG due to financial difficulties. Botev's opponents were awarded 3:0 wins by default during the second half of the season.\n\nFollowing the financial collapse in 2010, Botev Plovdiv were relegated to the third level of Bulgarian football, the amateur V Group for the 2010–11 season. The club was completely rebuilt on an administrative level, several Bulgarian players with first league and international experience helped the team return to B Group, such as striker Atanas Kurdov, midfielder Todor Timonov, captain Nikolay Manchev, and goalkeeper Armen Ambartsumyan. The club went unbeaten and won their regional third league, and thus gained promotion to the second level of Bulgarian football.\n\nA new coach was hired for the 2011–12 B Group season. Petar Houbchev, who had previous international experience both as a player and manager, succeeded Kostadin Vidolov. The lack of good results, however, saw Hubchev sacked from his position in October 2011. Botev Plovdiv then reached an agreement with a new head coach – Milen Radukanov, who didn't show good results either. Therefore, Kostadin Vidolov returned at the helm of the club and succeeded in gaining promotion to the first level of Bulgarian football, after a 2–0 win against Sportist Svoge in the play-offs.\nIn the 2012–13 A Group season, the club showed good performance and finished fourth. Botev Plovdiv was allowed to participate in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, taking the place of the then financially struggling CSKA Sofia, this marked the return of the team in Europe, after 18 years of absence. The club defeated the likes of Astana and Zrinjski Mostar, before being eliminated by Stuttgart in the third qualifying round. In 2013–14, Botev Plovdiv finished fourth once more and also reached the 2013–14 Bulgarian Cup final, where they lost 0–1 to Ludogorets Razgrad. The club faced the same opponents in the 2014 Bulgarian Supercup match, which was lost 1–3. On the European front, the team participated in 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, where they managed to eliminate Libertas, before losing to St. Pölten. The following seasons, the club frequently secured places in the middle of the table.\nOn 24 May 2017, Botev Plovdiv won their 3rd Bulgarian cup title in a 2–1 win against Ludogorets Razgrad, by doing so the club secured a spot in the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League, where they met Partizani Tirana and Beitar Jerusalem, before being knocked out by Marítimo in the third qualifying round. On 9 August 2017, the club won its first Bulgarian Supercup title, beating Ludogorets Razgrad 5–4 on penalties, following a 1–1 draw in regular time.\n\nBulgarian State Football Championship/A Group:\n\nBulgarian Cup:\n\nBulgarian Supercup:\n\nSoviet Army Cup:\n\nBalkans Cup:\n\nUEFA Cup Winners' Cup:\n\n\n\nIn 1959, the authorities allowed the construction of a new club stadium at the place of the old field in the neighborhood of Kamenitza. The first building works began on 21 July 1959. Two years later, Botev Plovdiv returned to The College. On May 14, 1961 the reconstructed stadium was inaugurated. The prime minister – Anton Yugov – attended the celebrations together with the deputy-minister of the defence Dobri Djurov and most of the communist leaders. The celebrations ended with a friendly match against FC Steaua Bucureşti won by the yellow-blacks with 3:0.\n\nFor more than 30 years, no big repairs were done on the College. In 1993, during the presidency of Hristo Danov, some serious repairs were made. The visitors's changing room was moved to the eastern part of the stadium. A tunnel under the East and the North stand was built to connect the visitors’ changing room with the field and the capacity of the stadium was reduced. In 1995 electric lighting was put in, but ironically it did not reach the standards of the Bulgarian Football Union.\n\nIn the years from 1926 to 1947, Botev played six international games on the ground – two wins, three losses and one draw. The matches were played against Admira Vienna (1:7), Kecskemét (3:2 and 2:4), Beşiktaş (0:0), Bohemians Prague (1:3) and the famous \"Wonderteam\" of Austria Vienna (sensational win with 5:4) respectively. The attendance record was set on February 27, 1963 during the quarter-final of the Cup Winner's Cup against Atlético Madrid (1:1) – 40,000 people. The record for the Bulgarian championship was set in 1966 against Levski Sofia(0:1) – 37,000 people, but because of the riots between the fans and the rush of fans on the field, Botev Plovdiv was forced to play its derbies at \"The Big House\" – the City Stadium.\n\nSeveral times, the stadium was used for football matches from the city rivals from Lokomotiv Plovdiv. During the second half of the 1980/81 season, \"The Smurfs\" (Lokomotiv Plovdiv) played their home matches on The College (which was followed by a relegation in the second division) as well as one match in the 2003/04 season (when Lokomotiv won the A PFG for the first time). Spartak Plovdiv also used the stadium for several matches during the 1995/1996 season. The stadium has also hosted the Bulgarian Cup final in 2000, when Levski Sofia won the cup after 2:0 against Naftex Burgas.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, the stadium underwent renovations to meet the requirements of the Football Union, the Central Stand was renovated and the new visitors's changing room was built under it.\n\nOn March 26, 2012 began a major reconstruction of the stadium, starting with conceptual design by architect Georgi Savov and supported by the new owner of the team Tzvetan Vassilev. According to estimates construction will consume about 15 million euro, and the facility must be ready for operation by mid 2015 just in time to host matches at the 2015 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. The reconstruction will be carried out in two phases, the first starting from the end of March 2012 and will last four months. The first stage consists in the replacement of the field, which will have modern drainage system and heating system . The field will be measuring 68x105 meters. Second stage consists of the demolishing of the four old tribunes and building of new ones closer to the football field.\n\nOn home matchdays, Botev Plovdiv's players traditionally enter the pitch to the Blue Canary tune (by Marisa Fiordaliso and Carlo Buti) before the start of a game.\n\nBotev Plovdiv has maintained a strong support over the years and the club's ultras group is known as \"Bultras\".\n\nBotev's eternal rival is the neighbouring city club of Lokomotiv Plovdiv, and both form the local Plovdiv derby. The two teams are the most supported ones in the second largest city in Bulgaria – Plovdiv – and the matches between them are well known to the Bulgarian football community, and also considered to be one of the fiercest rivalries in the world. Botev is the country's oldest continuously existing team, whereas Lokomotiv grew popular fanbase in the 70s. Traditionally, Lokomotiv's team drew support from the lower working class of society, whereas Botev's fanbase consisted mainly of the middle and upper classes, although that no longer applies.\n\nBotev's regional cross-city rival is Beroe Stara Zagora. The match between the two clubs was dubbed as the \"Thracian Derby\" over the years.\n\nThe club also has a strong rivalry with Levski Sofia and CSKA Sofia, as the three of which compete to be the most popular teams in the country.\n\nBotev fans have friendly relations with Aris Thessaloniki fans. In January 2020 a group of Botev fan that attended a game between Aris and their rival PAOK Thessaloniki was attacked by PAOK fans. One Botev fan was killed. Two individuals were arrested and charged with murder.\n\nBotev Plovdiv’s kit colours were adopted in August 1917, during a board meeting.\nThe yellow colour represents the club’s founders from Saint Augustine’s Catholic College and Thrace’s golden grain fields, while the black colour symbolises the black earth of the fertile soil as well as the Orthodoxy of the club’s other founders from First Boys High School.\n\nThe club’s current crest was first introduced in a different board meeting, held in September 1917. It’s a red circle, with a green rectangle situated above it, the name of the club is inscribed inside the rectangle. Above the four-sided figure is a yellow and black striped shield and underneath it is displayed the club's year of establishment.\n\nThe crests white, green and red colours are the tricolour of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Simultaneously, they symbolise the blood of the heroes, the pureness of the souls, and Bulgaria’s fertility. The shield is a symbol of the brave while the infinite circle suggests eternity.\n\nBotev Plovdiv's motto is Krasota, vyara i borba (, ; ).\n\nBulgarian teams can register up to five players without EU citizenship, but can use only three of them during match days. Those non-EU nationals with European ancestry can claim citizenship from the nation their ancestors came from. If an individual doesn't have European ancestry, he can claim Bulgarian citizenship after playing in Bulgaria for 5 years.\n\n12 – Dedicated to the club's supporters\n\n \n\nNote: \"For a complete list of Botev Plovdiv players, see .\"\n\n"}

Originally commissioned by King Sejo in 1446, it was completed under the reign of Seongjong of Joseon, in 1485. The official Choe Bu was one of the scholars who helped compile and edit the work. The earlier works on which it may have been based have not survived. The \"Dongguk Tonggam\" is the earliest extant record to list the names of the rulers of Gojoseon after Dangun.\n\nDongguk Tonggam is a one-year-old narrative system. From the Three Kingdoms Period to 669 (the 9th year of the Silla Dynasty), from the establishment of the Three Kingdoms to the year of King Munmu (the 9th year of the reign of King Taejo of the Goryeo Dynasty), the two kingdoms of Shilla considered the period. Dongguk Tonggam contains a total of 382 passages. Among them, 178 were selected from existing librarians. The rest of the argument was written by the writer himself. In particular, Choi Bu left 118 episodes. Dongguk Tonggam is a valuable source of historical information and descriptions from the Joseon Dynasty. \n\nIn this book, the historical positions of Gija-Chosun, Mahan, and Silla, their successors, are elevated, and the positions of Dangun Chosun, Goguryeo, Baekje, Balhae and Goryeo are relatively lowered.\n\nThe book was first compiled by King Sejo in his attempt to reconstruct Korean history by accepting romantic and mythical historical descriptions rather than being bound by Confucian causes. However, it was not completed due to the uncooperative efforts of the Yushin groups to protect Confucian causes. <Samguksajeolyo> is part of the <Dongguk Tonggam>, which was revised under the Confucian justification, and was still part of the romantic atmosphere during King Sejo's reign. \n\n\n"}

Riley portrayed Mandy Dingle in the television soap opera \"Emmerdale\" between 1995 and 2001, and again from 2019. She also replaced Jeremy Beadle as the presenter of \"You've Been Framed!\" between 1998 and 2002. She was also a contestant on the tenth series of \"Strictly Come Dancing\", and a panellist on the ITV daytime series \"Loose Women\".\n\nRiley trained at the Oldham Theatre Workshop from the age of nine, and was signed by an agent three years later. Riley's early roles included appearances as an extra in both \"Coronation Street\" and Brookside as well as a cast member in \"Butterfly Kiss\" which was directed by Michael Winterbottom. She then appeared in a guest role as Mandy Dingle in the British soap opera \"Emmerdale\" in 1995. After proving popular with the audience, Riley was invited to join the soap's regular cast the following year. In 1996, Riley won the National Television Awards for \"Most Popular Newcomer\" for her work in \"Emmerdale\". She continued to play Mandy until 2001 after deciding to pursue other television roles.\n\nRiley portrayed Princess Jean in the CITV Awards 1997, and also presented \"You've Been Framed\" between 1998 and 2002, taking over from the former presenter, Jeremy Beadle and raising viewers figures to more than 13 million at its peak in the process. In 1999, Riley appeared in \"Put Out More Fags\" and had a cameo role in the music video for \"When the Going Gets Tough\" by Boyzone. The following year, she appeared in \"ITV\" Christmas Pantomime, \"Aladdin\", with Ed Byrne, Patsy Kensit, Julian Clary and Paul Merton and in 2001, she appeared in a commercial for Heineken. The 2006 album \"I Rock Eye Pop\" by Kings Have Long Arms includes a track titled \"Lisa Riley\". The Half Man Half Biscuit song \"Breaking News\" mentions Riley.\n\nRiley featured as Rebecca Patterson, a \"shy, retiring, twentysomething\" woman, in the drama series \"Fat Friends\" across three series between 2002 and 2005. Riley portrayed Goody McEldrich in a 2011 episode of the UK children's show 'Young Dracula', and during 2012, she appeared as Nadia Hicks in the second series of ITV crime drama, \"Scott & Bailey\". Between 2011 and 2013, Riley made guest appearance as Tina Allen in the BBC school drama \"Waterloo Road\". Later that year, Riley signed up as a contestant on the tenth series of \"Strictly Come Dancing\", partnering with Robin Windsor. Riley juggled the rehearsals for \"Strictly Come Dancing\" with filming two appearances for \"Waterloo Road\" in February 2013. The couple have been lauded as the stars of the series, with notable moments including Riley lifting Windsor, Riley doing the splits at Wembley Arena, and the couple showing surprisingly brilliant technicality. The couple were eliminated during the semi-finals, on 16 December 2012. She has since appeared on the 2013 live tour and the backstage show \"Strictly Confidential\", directed by Craig Revel Horwood, who often praised her on the show.\n\nIn September 2016, it was announced that Riley had joined the ITV daytime series \"Loose Women\" as one of three new panellists, following a series of guest appearances during the year. In May 2017, Riley featured in the BBC miniseries \"Three Girls\" as Lorna, the mother of one of the main characters. In August 2018, Riley starred in another BBC drama, \"Age Before Beauty\", as Tina Reegan, a gothic tattoo artist. Riley's return to \"Emmerdale\" for one storyline was announced on 13 November 2018. The character returns for a guest stint from January 2019. She later returned full-time from September 2019.\n\nRiley's other television credits include roles in \"The Bill\", \"Holby City\", \"Doctors\", the BBC \"Afternoon Play\" series, \"Having It Off\". She also played the role of Beth Trailor in the film \"Secret Society\". On stage, Riley has appeared in fourteen pantomimes, including an starring role in \"Aladdin\" at the Kings Theatre in Southsea, Portsmouth during the 2009–10 pantomime season, as well as the UK tours of \"The Play What I Wrote\", \"The Vagina Monologues\", \"The Naked Truth\", \"Waiting for Gateaux\" and \"Calendar Girls\".\n\nIn late 2016, Riley lost over 10 stone in weight, making her first TV appearance since the change on \"Loose Women\". Since becoming a regular panellist, Riley has spoken honestly about her weight loss and both the joy and sadness it has brought. After having surgery to remove excess skin, Riley describe herself as finally having her dream \"cello\" shaped body.\n\nRiley describes herself as a \"dedicated vegetarian\".\n\n"}

It is by far the country's largest university, as well as the second largest public university in South America and the world's 57th largest by enrollment, with a student body of 137,757 undergraduate students in 2018 and 6,351 postgraduate students in 2012. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current rector is Rodrigo Arim.\n\nThe process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833, when a law proposed by then-Senator Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga was passed. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836 the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence.\n\nOn 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree through which created the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.\n\nIn 2011, according to University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), it is the best university in Uruguay and 858th best university in the world.\n\nIn 2015, according to QS World University Rankings, it ranks #701-750 worldwide and #38 in Latin America.\n\nIn 2018, according to QS World University Rankings, it ranks #801-1000 Worldwide, and remains in the #38 Latin American rankings.\n\n\nThe University of the Republic Law School was established on June 18, 1838 as the Academy of Jurisprudence, making it the oldest law school in the nation. It became a branch of the University of the Republic on July 18, 1849. It is the only branch of the university that hasn't moved from the main building downtown Montevideo. It was the only law school in Uruguay until the arrival of the Catholic University in 1984.\n\nMany Presidents of Uruguay, senators, representatives and other public authorities with a law degree have graduated from this law school. Notable professors include Jorge Gamarra, Alejandro Abal, Alberto Perez Perez, Dora Bagdassarian, Helios Sarthou, Carlos Delpiazzo, Gonzalo Fernández, and Daniel Ferrere.\n\nThe Dean is Dr. Cristina Mangarelli. Its main executive organ is the Law School Council, integrated by the dean and members in representation of students, former students and professors.\n\n\nThe university has its own hospital in Montevideo, Hospital de Clínicas “Dr. Manuel Quintela”.\n\nIn an effort to decentralize higher education, the University has opened schools in cities other than Montevideo. Its \"Regional Norte\" in Salto offers degrees in Architecture, Law and Nursing. Fragments of other degrees, which can be completed in Montevideo, are also offered there. At the \"Casa Universitaria\" in Rivera, the Faculty of Sciences offers the Technicature in Management of Environmental Resources, which has a duration of two and a half years.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252874", "title": "Epidemiology of suicide", "text": "Epidemiology of suicide\n\nAn estimated 1 million people worldwide die by suicide every year. It is estimated that global annual suicide fatalities could rise to over 1.5 million by 2020. Globally, suicide ranks among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years. Attempted suicides are up to 20 times more frequent than completed ones.\n\nIncidence of suicide in a society depends on a range of factors. Clinical depression is an especially common cause. Substance abuse and severe physical disease or infirmity are also recognized as causes. The Eastern Europe and East Asia regions have the highest suicide rate worldwide. The region with the lowest suicide rate is the Caribbean, followed by the Middle East.\n\nGender differences play a significant role in suicide as well. Furthermore, among all age groups in most of the world, females tend to show higher rates of reported nonfatal suicidal behaviors, while males have a much higher rate of completed suicides.\n\nIn most countries the incidence of suicides is higher than the incidence of intentional homicides. More people die of suicide than die of war and murder.\n\nA 2006 report by the World Health Organization (WHO) states that nearly a million people take their own lives every year, more than those murdered or killed in war. WHO figures show a suicide takes place somewhere in the world roughly every 40 seconds.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide contagion is a serious problem, especially for young people. Suicide can be facilitated in vulnerable teens by exposure to real or fictional accounts of suicide, including media coverage of suicide, such as intensive reporting of the suicide of a celebrity or idol.\n\nSuicide rates are highest in Europe's Baltic states, where around 40 people per 100,000 die by suicide each year. The lowest rates are found mainly in Caribbean/West Indies nations and a few countries in Asia.\n\nMore than 30,000 people commit suicide in Russia every year; more than 40,000 people die by suicide each year in the United States; over 30,000 kill themselves in Japan; and about 250,000 commit suicide each year in China. In western countries men commit suicide at four times the rate of women. Women are more likely to attempt suicide than men.\n\nThe countries of the former Soviet Bloc have the highest suicide rate in the world. Rate of suicide in South Korea is the highest among any other East Asian countries. The region with the lowest suicide rate is Latin America.\n\nChina is the only country in the world where the rate of suicide by women matches that of men, with statistics even showing a slightly higher number of female cases.\n\nBetween 1999-2006, in the United States, suicide was the third leading cause of death in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, and the fourth leading cause of death for children aged 10 to 14 years. As of 2011, suicide increased in this age group, becoming the second cause of death for youth between the ages of 15 and 24 years, below homicide statistics and above those of accidents. Geographically within the United States, western states have higher rates of suicide. Per 100,000 people, Montana is ranked first, Alaska ranked second, and Wyoming is third. There may be a link between these states and firearm regulations, which make access to guns easier, as statistics show firearm suicides in states with the highest rates of gun ownership are 3.7 times higher for men, and 7.9 times higher for women. These are often rural areas without heavily populated urban communities (which brings social pressure stressors), but may indicate a lack of accessibility to medical and psychological health assistance in these remote areas.\n\nIn the United States, males are four times more likely to die by suicide than females, although more women than men report suicide attempts and self-harm with suicidal intentions. Male suicide rates are far higher than females in all age groups (the ratio varies from 3:1 to 10:1). In other western countries, males are also much more likely to die by suicide than females (usually by a factor of 3–4:1). It was the 8th leading cause of death for males, and 19th leading cause of death for females.\n\nExcess male mortality from suicide is lower in non-Western where as of 2015 in China (about one fifth of world population) and seven more countries it is absent, with females more likely to die by suicide than males by a factor of 1.3–1.6\n\nIn 2003, in the United States, whites and Asians were nearly 2.5 times more likely to kill themselves than were blacks or Hispanics. There is a marked divergence by age as seen in the chart below. In the eastern portion of the world (primarily in Asian or Pacific-Island countries) the numbers of reported suicides is growing every year.\n\nThe likelihood of suicide attempts are increased in both gay males and lesbians, as well as bisexuals of both sexes when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. The trend of having a higher incident rate among females is no exception with lesbians or bisexual females and when compared with homosexual males, lesbians are more likely to attempt than gay or bisexual males.\n\nStudies vary with just how increased the risk is compared to heterosexuals with a low of 0.8-1.1 times more likely for females and 1.5-2.5 times more likely for males. The highs reach 4.6 more likely in females and 14.6 more likely in males.\n\nRace and age play a factor in the increased risk. The highest ratios for males are attributed to caucasians when they are in their youth. By the age of 25, their risk is down to less than half of what it was however black gay males risk steadily increases to 8.6 times more likely. Through a lifetime the risks are 5.7 for white and 12.8 for black gay and bisexual males.\n\nLesbian and bisexual females have opposite effects with less attempts in youth when compared to heterosexual females. Through a lifetime the likelihood to attempt nearly triple the youth 1.1 ratio for caucasian females, however for black females the rate is affected very little (less than 0.1 to 0.3 difference) with heterosexual black females having a slightly higher risk throughout most of the age-based study.\n\nGay and lesbian youth who attempt suicide are disproportionately subject to anti-gay attitudes, and have weaker skills for coping with discrimination, isolation, and loneliness, and were more likely to experience family rejection than those who do not attempt suicide. Another study found that gay and bisexual youth who attempted suicide had more feminine gender roles, adopted an LGB identity at a young age and were more likely than peers to report sexual abuse, drug abuse, and arrests for misconduct.\n\nOne study found that same-sex sexual behavior, but not homosexual attraction or homosexual identity, was significantly predictive of suicide among Norwegian adolescents. In Denmark, the age-adjusted suicide mortality risk for men in registered domestic partnerships was nearly eight times greater than for men with positive histories of heterosexual marriage and nearly twice as high for men who had never married.\n\nA study of suicide, undertaken in Sweden, involved the analysis of data records for 6,456 same-sex married couples and 1,181,723 man-women marriages. Even with Sweden's tolerant attitude regarding homosexuality, it was determined that for same-sex married men the suicide risk was nearly three times higher than for different-sex married men, even after an adjustment for HIV status. For women, it was shown that there was a tentatively elevated suicide risk for same-sex married women over that of different-sex married women.\n\nCompared with other countries, atheist states, such as the People's Republic of China, have the highest suicide rate (25.6 per 100,000 persons).\n\nIn a global study on atheism, sociologist Phil Zuckerman noted countries with higher levels of atheism had the highest suicide rates compared to countries with \"statistically insignificant levels of organic atheism.\"\n\nHigher levels of social and national cohesion reduce suicide rates. Suicide levels are highest among the retired, unemployed, impoverished, divorced, the childless, urbanites, empty nesters, and other people who live alone. Suicide rates also rise during times of economic uncertainty. (Although poverty is not a direct cause, it can contribute to the risk of suicide).\nEpidemiological studies generally show a relationship between suicide or suicidal behaviors and socio-economic disadvantage, including limited educational achievement, homelessness, unemployment, economic dependence, and contact with the police or justice system. War is traditionally believed to be associated with a fall in suicide rates; however, this has been questioned in recent studies, showing a more complex picture than previously conceived.\n\nA 2015 UK study by the Office for National Statistics, commissioned by Public Health England, which considered 18,998 deaths of people aged between 20 and 64, found that men working in the construction industry and women employed in culture, media and sport, healthcare and primary school teaching were at the highest risk of suicide.\n\nDepression, either unipolar or as part of bipolar disorder, is an especially common cause. Substance abuse, severe physical disease or infirmity are also recognized causes.\n\nAn unknown number of suicidal fatalities are falsely presumed to be the consequences of severe illnesses, infectious, malignant, mental et cetera.\n\nRisk of suicide may decrease with increased weight and is low in obese persons. The connection is not well understood, but it is hypothesized that elevated body weight results in higher circulating levels of tryptophan, serotonin, and leptin, which in turn reduces impulsivity.\n\nHowever, other studies indicate that suicide rates increase with extreme obesity, and it is difficult to control for conflating factors such as BMI-related differences in longevity, which have a significant bearing on suicide rates.\n\nThe idea that suicide is more common during the winter holidays (including Christmas in the northern hemisphere) is actually a myth, generally reinforced by media coverage associating suicide with the holiday season. The National Center for Health Statistics found that suicides drop during the winter months, and peak during spring and early summer. Considering that there is a correlation between the winter season and rates of depression, there are theories that this might be accounted for by capability to commit suicide and relative cheerfulness. Suicide has also been linked to other seasonal factors.\n\nThe variation in suicides by day of week is actually greater than any seasonal variation.\n\nCertain time trends can be related to the type of death. In the United Kingdom, for example, the steady rise in suicides from 1945 to 1963 was probably to some extent curtailed following the removal of carbon monoxide from domestic gas supplies which occurred with the change from coal gas to natural gas during the sixties. Methods vary across cultures, and the easy availability of lethal agents and materials plays a role.\n\nIt is estimated that global annual suicide fatalities could rise to 1.5 million by 2020.\nWorldwide, suicide ranks among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years. Suicide attempts are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicides.\n\nHistorical data show lower suicide rates during periods of war.\n\n"}

Far from lucid, Brian Wilson would occasionally appear on stage, primarily as a replacement for brother Carl, who was concurrently embarking on a solo career. Dennis Wilson would show up to occasional concerts, but would usually be argumentative and disruptive. Mike Love, Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston were the only stable members of a band who now had a whole cast of supporting musicians when they performed live. However, the release of \"Ten Years of Harmony\" kept the pretense going and, unexpectedly, the \"M.I.U.

He also competed at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn 1905, Coaffee emigrated from Great Britain to Canada. His athletic career then began in 1915 at the \"North End Amateur Athletic Club\". Five years later he won the Canadian trails for the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp for the 100 meter dash with a time of 11.2 seconds. However, his country's Olympic team was initially not taken into account due to budget concerns, but a fundraiser hosted by the Duke of Winnipeg allowed him to participate.\n\nIn Antwerp, Coaffee started in the 100 meters and 200 meters. In both disciplines he was third in his runnings and neither qualified him for the later races. In 1922 at the Canadian Championships, he set the world record for the 100 yard dash, beating the record of Charlie Paddock with a time of 9.6 seconds. At the same event, he also won the 220 yard event. In October 1922, he then set a new Canadian Record for the 4 by 220 yard relay race, together with Laurie Armstrong, Billy Miller and Peavey Heffelfinger.\n\nIn 1924 he was captain of the Canadian delegation to the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris.

{"id": "2252898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252898", "title": "Martinet dioxindole synthesis", "text": "Martinet dioxindole synthesis\n\nThe Martinet dioxindole synthesis was first reported in 1913 by J. Marinet. It is a chemical reaction in which a primary or secondary aniline or substituted aromatic amine is condensed with ethyl or methyl ester of mesoxalic acid to make a dioxindole in the absence of oxygen.\n\nIn the first step, the amino group on the aniline (1) attacks the carbonyl of the ethyl oxomalonate (2). A proton from the nitrogen is extracted by the oxygen and an alcohol group forms (3). The carbonyl re-forms to make a keto group and an ethanol molecule leaves (4). Next, a ring closing reaction occurs by the bond from the aromatic benzene ring attacking the partially positive carbonyl to form a five-member ring (5). After a proton transfer (6), an isomerization or a [1,3] hydride shift occurs and aromaticity is restored to the six-membered ring (7). In the presence of base, the ester is hydrolyzed, ethanol is lost (8) and a decarboxylation occurs (9). The resulting product is the desired dioxindole (10).\n\nIn the presence of oxygen, dioxindole converts to isatin through oxidation.\n\nThe Martinet dioxindole synthesis is utilized in the preparation of oxindole derivatives. Oxindole derivatives found in natural products are gaining popularity in research because of their structural diversity. 3-substituted-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole is the central structure of a wide variety of biologically important compounds found in natural products. The 3-substituted-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole structure holds anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-HIV, and neuroprotective properties. The utilization of this core structure for drug synthesis and the relevant cellular pathways involved are being extensively studied. The enantio-selective addition of 3-substituted oxindole derivatives to different electrophiles gives access to chiral 3,3-disubstituted oxindole derivatives. The dioxindole is a strong nucleophile for the Michael addition of dioxindoles to nitroalkenes in order to obtain 3,3-disubstituted oxindole derivatives.\n\nThe Martinet dioxindole synthesis proceeds with an alkoxyaniline, 3,4,5-trimethoxyaniline, which reacts with an oxomalonic ester in glacial acetic acid to synthesize 2-carbethoxy-4,5,6-trimethoxyindoxyl, 2-carbethoxy-3,4,5,6-tetramethoxyindole and 4,5,6-trimethoxy-3-hydroxy-3-carbethoxyindole.\n\nDioxindole is a non-aromatic heterocyclic organic compound. It has a bicyclic structure consisting of a six-membered aromatic ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen containing ring. It is a hydroxy derivative of oxindole first prepared by reducing isatin with sodium amalgam in an alkaline solution.\n\n"}

This wave of bombings began with the assassination attempt on Marwan Hmade, then peaked with the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri on 14 February 2005, which touched off the Cedar Revolution and the withdrawal of Syrian troops. After the massive protests sparked by Hariri's killing, several more bombings hit Lebanon.\n\nThese bombings and assassinations came after September 2004, when the Lebanese Parliament was forced to extend the term of pro-Syrian former president Emile Lahoud, a move that was unconstitutional. The MPs, journalists, and activists that opposed this term extension were then subject to a series of slander campaigns and eventually assassination attempts.\n\nOn 1 October 2004, a car bomb exploded next to the motorcade carrying Druze MP Marwan Hamadeh. Hamadeh was injured, but survived; his driver was killed. Hamadeh had been a critic of Syria and was a member of the opposition to then president Émile Lahoud.\n\nA massive explosion on 14 February 2005, killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in Beirut, near the St. George Hotel. Also killed was the former Minister of the Economy, Bassel Fleihan, and 19 other people. About 220 others were wounded.\n\nA group calling itself \"The Nasra & Jihad Group in Greater Syria\" claimed responsibility for the blast. The group had not been heard from before. A tape aired by Al Jazeera showed a bearded man, believed to be a Palestinian named Ahmad Abu Adas, claiming the attack. Adas' apartment was raided but he remains missing; however, it is now thought he was forced to admit to the plot and was killed by those who planned the assassination.\n\nAccording to the United Nations report by Detlev Mehlis, released 20 October 2005, the blast was the result of a truck bomb. A security camera captured a white Mitsubishi truck driving near Hariri's convoy moments before the blast; investigators determined this truck carried the explosives, estimated at 1,000 kg. Since Hariri's convoy had jamming devices meant to block remote control signals, the attack was carried out using a suicide bomber. The report cited a witness who said the bomber was an Iraqi who was led to believe his target was Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, who had been in Beirut just days before.\n\nThe report concluded that top Syrian and Lebanese officials planned the assassination beginning in mid-2004.\n\nA car bomb exploded in the New Jdeideh suburb of Beirut on 19 March 2005. The blast happened in a part-commercial, part-residential area, and wounded eleven people. Reports said that the driver had tried to park in front of a bingo hall, and was turned away and parked next to an apartment building instead.\n\nOn 23 March, a bomb left in a leather bag exploded at the back entrance of the Kaslik shopping center in Jounieh. Three janitors, two Indians and a Pakistani, were killed, and two Sri Lankans and two Lebanese were injured. The roof of the mall collapsed.\n\nThe car of Ali Ramez Tohme, a journalist and president of the Dar al-Haitham for Journalism, Printing and Press, was bombed early on 15 September in the area of Mazboud.

The civil parish covers the villages of Denby Dale, Lower Denby, Upper Denby, Upper Cumberworth, Lower Cumberworth, Skelmanthorpe, Emley, Emley Moor. The parish had a population of 14,982 according to the 2001 census, increasing to 16,365 at the 2011 Census. The parish council gives the electorate of the village itself as 2,143. The River Dearne runs through the village; in the floods of 2007 it burst its banks on two separate occasions and caused damage to Springfield Mill.\n\nFirst recorded as Denby Dyke. Before the Industrial Revolution the village was sparsely-populated with a small textile industry at the crossroads of the Barnsley to Shepley Lane Head and the Wakefield to Denby Dale roads. Within 25 years, factories and mills had been built and had a railway station on the Penistone Line. Denby Dale provided the textile industry with raw materials, coal, and transportation. Silk for the Queen Mother's wedding dress was made at Springfield Mill. With the economy flourishing, the population increased and the village grew.\n\nThe village is served by Denby Dale railway station, and also has 2 bus stops.\n\nDenby Dale First and Nursery school (formerly known as Gilthwaites First School and Denby Dale Nursery) provides education from aged 2 to aged 10. Denby Dale Nursery School received an outstanding OFSTED report in 2012. Denby Church of England Voluntary Aided First School is a voluntary aided primary school associated with the Church of England in Upper Denby. The school has two classes, infants and juniors, with the infants running through years reception to year 2 and the juniors running through the years 3 to 5. At the turn of the millennium, there were around 40 to 50 pupils in the school.\n\nDenby Dale has a tradition of baking giant pies, which started in 1788 to celebrate the recovery of King George III from mental illness. To date ten pies have been made as part of nine pie festivals. In August 1887, a pie baked to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria spoiled and was buried in quick lime. A replacement pie (the 'resurrection' pie) was baked in September 1887. The sixth pie was baked on 1 August 1896, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the repeal of the corn laws. The seventh (the Infirmary Pie) raised money to endow a cot at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. The eighth pie, in 1964, was to celebrate four royal births but was marred by the deaths of four committee members in a car accident while returning from filming in London for a pilot of a television show (later to become the Eamonn Andrews Show). The eighth pie raised money to provide a village hall. The most recent in 2000, weighed and celebrated the new millennium. Denby Dale Pies was founded in the village. In 1940 it was agreed by the Denby Dale Local Comforts Fund, the giant pie dish would be sold for scrap to help the war effort. There was a procession, cricket match, dancing all followed by the selling of the dish.\n\n"}

One such common device used for this purpose is known as the transient voltage suppression diode that is simply a Zener diode designed to protect electronics device against overvoltages. Another design alternative applies a family of products that are known as metal-oxide varistors (MOV) that protect electronic circuits and electrical equipment.\n\nThe characteristic of a TVS requires that it respond to overvoltages faster than other common overvoltage protection components such as varistors or gas discharge tubes. This makes TVS devices or components useful for protection against very fast and often damaging voltage spikes. These fast overvoltage spikes are present on all distribution networks and can be caused by either internal or external events, such as lightning or motor arcing.\n\nApplications of transient voltage suppression diodes are used for unidirectional or bidirectional electrostatic discharge protection of transmission or data lines in electronic circuits. MOV-based TVSs are used to protect home electronics, distribution systems and may accommodate industrial level power distribution disturbances saving downtime and damage to equipment. The level of energy in a transient overvoltage can be equated to energy measured in joules or related to electric current when devices are rated for various applications. These bursts of overvoltage can be measured with specialized electronic meters that can show power disturbances of thousands of volts amplitude that last for a few microseconds or less.\n\nGreat care should be taken while designing overvoltage protection unit of electronic devices, because e.g. MOV was documented to have frequently caused fires while being exposed to overvoltage enough to activate MOV to start conducting, but not enough to totally destroy it, or to blow a house fuse. That condition caused significant heating of the MOV, which in turn caused printed circuit board (PCB) and MOV burning and eventually started a fire.\n\n\n"}

While there had been three other Daewongun during the Joseon dynasty, so dominant a place did Yi Ha-eung have in the history of the late Joseon dynasty that the term Daewongun usually refers specifically to him.\n\nThe Daewongun is remembered for the wide-ranging reforms he attempted during his regency, as well as for his \"vigorous enforcement of the seclusion policy, persecution of Christians, and the killing or driving off of foreigners who landed on Korean soil\".\n\nThe Daewongun was born Yi Ha-eung in 1820. He was the fourth son of Yi Chae-jung, a member of the royal family who in 1816 was given the name Yi Gu and the title Prince Namyeon. The Daewongun was a direct descendant of King Injo.\n\nThe Daewongun was well schooled in Confucianism and the Chinese classics. He reputedly excelled in calligraphy and painting. His early government career consisted of minor posts that were mostly honorary and ceremonial. For the beginning of his life, his connection to the royal house seemed of little help to him. He was poor and humiliated by the rich in-laws of the royal house.\n\nThe Daewongun came to power when his second son, Yi Myeong-bok, was chosen to become king.\n\nIn January 1864, King Cheoljong died without an heir. The selection of the next king was in the hands of three dowagers: Queen Sinjeong, mother of King Heonjong; Queen Myeongheon, King Heonjong’s wife; and Queen Cheorin, Cheoljong's wife. The \"designation right\" resided with Dowager Queen Sinjeong, as she was the oldest of the dowagers.\n\nIn an apocryphal story, Queen Cheorin sent a minister to fetch the son of Yi Ha-eung, eleven-year-old Yi Myeong-bok, who was flying a kite in a palace garden. The son was brought to the palace in a sedan chair, where Queen Sinjeong rushed forward and called him her son, thus producing the new Joseon king, King Gojong, adopted son of Crown Prince Hyomyeong. This story may or may not be true.\n\nThese facts, however, are known to be correct. On 16 January 1864, Yi Myeong-bok was appointed the Prince of Ikseong by Dowager Queen Sinjeong. The next day, his father was granted the title Daewongun. On 21 January, Yi Myeong-bok was enthroned as King Gojong, and Dowager Queen Sinjeong began her regency. Yi was apparently chosen because \"he was the only suitable surviving male member of the Yi clan and closest by blood to the royal house\".\n\nSince Gojong was so young, Queen Sinjeong invited the Daewongun to assist his son in ruling. She virtually renounced her right to be regent, and though she remained the titular regent, the Daewongun was in fact the true ruler.\n\nOnce Gojong became king, there still remained the question of his marriage. Gojong's mother Yeoheung decided upon a daughter of the Min clan, Lady Min. The Daewongun remarked that Min \"was a woman of great determination and poise\" and was slightly disturbed by her. However, he allowed her to marry his son, and unknowingly created his greatest political rival.\n\nDuring his regency, the Daewongun attempted several reforms. His main goal was to \"crush the old ruling faction that had virtually usurped the sovereign power of the kings earlier in the century\".\n\nWhen he took power in 1864, the Daewongun was determined to reform the government and strengthen central control. He led an anti-corruption campaign, disciplined the royal clans, and taxed the aristocracy, the yangban. Cumings notes that this was not a revolution but a restoration, as the Daewongun was attempting to return to the days of King Sejong in the fifteenth century.\n\nOne of the Daewongun's effective acts as regent was the reconstruction of Gyeongbok Palace. The palace had been built during the reign of the first Joseon king. Much of the building was destroyed in a fire in 1533 and the rest was destroyed during the Japanese invasion of 1592. The rebuilding took seven years and five months. It was perhaps the most costly project during the Joseon dynasty.\n\nThe Daewongun's reforms were not very successful, as some scholars say he was \"too high-handed and tactless\". Not only that, but his policies did not have a lasting effect, as once Gojong came of age in 1874, he forced the Daewongun into semiretirement and undid many of his reforms.\n\nThe Daewongun's foreign policy was rather simple, as Cumings describes it: \"no treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan\". He instead maintained an isolationist policy.\n\nThe Isolation Policy was a policy made to isolate Joseon from all foreign forces except for China which he believed to be the strongest. He tried to refuse Russia's quest to open Joseon's ports to them by using France, but France refused to help – causing the 1866 \"Byeong-in Persecution\". He was involved in the General Sherman incident as well. The Isolation Policy became more entrenched in 1868 when, German merchant Ernst Oppert attempted to take hostage the bones of the Daewongun's father in order to force him to open Korea to trade; and even further so after the 1871 American attack of Gwanghwado.\n\nThe Isolation Policy provided immediate benefits of fortifying Korean patriotism as well as protecting their culture of Confucianism. The Heungseon Daewongun was able to protect Joseon from cultural imperialism and westernization and thus protect Korea's heritage from it. However, because he refused to engage in international relations entirely, there was a limited choice of market and slim opportunity for an industrial revolution to occur. Indeed, the Daewongun wanted to avoid engagement with the West – which would have been inevitable if Western countries were allowed to trade freely – as it would erode government influence. The Joseon Dynasty had a strict social hierarchy: the wealth of the yangban nobility resting on the backs of sangmin farm labourers and tenants; the Daewongun wanted to prevent the collapse of this hierarchy as, despite his fame for his fairness and support of civilization, the emancipation of the sangmin would mean the ruin of the yangban, his own class.\n\nThe international relations of Joseon worsened as the Daewongun adopted increasingly desperate and harsher measures in order to repel Westernization. The Daewongun made the choice of protecting the world he knew by trying to shut out foreigners, at the cost of delaying development and modernization, and to keep Korea a hermit kingdom. Many Koreans state that had he chose to engage with foreign countries as his daughter-in-law Queen Min advocated, the Japanese rule of Korea could have been avoided. However, others state that the ten years of the Isolation Policy was too small a part of the Joseon Dynasty to derive such a statement from.\n\nIn 1874, King Gojong came of age. His wife, Queen Min, influenced his decision to \"assume the full measure of royal responsibility\", an action that forced the Daewongun into semiretirement.\n\nThe Daewongun enjoyed a brief return to power during the Imo Incident in 1882. On the second day of the mutiny, a group of rioters were received by the Daewongun, \"who reportedly exhorted them to bring down the Min regime and expel the Japanese\". King Gojong asked his father, the Daewongun to come to the palace. The Daewongun’s appearance, escorted by 200 mutineers, \"put an immediate end to the wild melee.\" Gojong gave the Daewongun \"all the small and large matters of the government\" and thus the Daewongun resumed his rule. Both Japanese and Chinese forces headed towards Korea to put down the rebellion, and Ma Chien-chung, a Chinese diplomat in Korea, decided that it was time to remove the Daewongun.\n\nThe Chinese had three reasons they wanted to remove the Daewongun: First, he attempted to overthrow the pro-Chinese Min faction. Second, \"he created a situation which invited the Japanese troops to Korea, thus precipitating the danger of a military conflict between Japan on the one hand and Korea and China on the other.\" And third, \"the Taewongun [Daewongun]-inspired disturbance threatened the foundation of a lawfully constituted government in a dependent nation\".\n\nMa arrested the Daewongun on the charge of disrespect to the emperor for \"usurping the power which the emperor had invested in the king of Korea\". However, as he was the father of the king, he was dealt with leniently. One hundred Chinese soldiers escorted the Daewongun to a waiting Chinese warship, and from there to Tianjin.\n\nIn the fall of 1885, the Chinese returned the Daewongun to Korea, \"despite strong objections from the queen and her followers\".\n\nIn 1894, the Japanese were strengthening their hold over Korea. They needed someone amenable to them to be a leader in Korea during the Gabo Reform. They approached the Daewongun as a potential leader. When he agreed, on 23 July Japanese soldiers liberated him from the house arrest Gojong had placed him under. In exchange for his help, the Daewongun asked for a promise that if the reforms succeeded, \"Japan will not demand a single piece of Korean territory\". The soldiers took him to the palace, where they approached the king. The Daewongun reproached King Gojong and announced that he would be taking over.\n\nThe Japanese became nervous after placing the Daewongun in charge, as he seemed interested \"only in grasping power and purging his opponents and did not see the need for a reform policy\". By September 1894, the Japanese decided that the Daewongun was not to be trusted. By early October, it became clear that \"the plan to use the Taewongun [Daewongun] as a vehicle for the reform program had misfired\". A Japanese statesman, Inoue Kaoru, was sent to Korea as the new resident minister, where he told the Daewongun, \"You always stand in the way,\" and forced the Daewongun to promise that he would \"abstain from interference in political affairs\".\n\nIn 1895, Japanese officials in Korea were plotting the removal of Gojong's wife, Queen Min. Miura Gorō, Inoue Kaoru's successor as Japanese advisor to the Korean government, and Sugimura Fukashi, a secretary of the Japanese legation, planned the attempt. The two decided to involve the Daewongun in the plot, and after making inquiries, learned that he was \"indignant enough to plan a coup\" and would cooperate with them. On 8 October 1895, early in the morning, Japanese policemen escorted the Daewongun to the palace. His involvement from that point on is unclear, but on that morning, Japanese agents assassinated Queen Min.\n\nThe Daewongun died in 1899.\n\n\n\n\nLee, Moon-Su.

The eleven chapters of the novel are labelled from January 1895 to October 1899 and follow the writer from his failure in the London theatre, with the play \"Guy Domville\", to his seclusion in the town of Rye, East Sussex, where in the following years he rapidly produced several masterpieces.\n\nThe novel starts with a portrait of Henry as a public figure who feels humiliated in an unexpected way, not just in the public side of his writing career but also in a more personal way, in which all the precautions he had taken to carry on with his life as he wished it to be, come to a crisis. Henry resolves to reduce his public life by buying a house in Rye and there he nurses his loneliness and is haunted by all the consequences his need to maintain a protected space in which to live and write has generated all through his life. He's in his fifties and he's very much aware of how he had to refuse the company of his ill sister, whom he adored, at some point, how he chose to stay away from his country and his family, how he felt to turn cold with a writer friend he had been very close to previously and becomes a bachelor with an unresolved sexuality, certainly close to homosexuality, living in a house with servants in the South of England and a daily visit of the stenographer to whom he dictates. The portrait of Henry, a man appalled by the Oscar Wilde case while repressing his self and his sexuality, shows a complex and ambiguous man. He copes with life by exerting control over how much he would reveal, even to himself, and choosing to be a writer in order to achieve precisely that.\n\nDuring his acceptance of the 2011 Irish PEN Award, Colm Tóibín was lauded as a “Champion of minorities”. To find himself the recipient of such praise was hardly a likely outcome when one considers the conservative rural background that he emerged from, saying of his youth spent in his family home that it was characterised by \"a great deal of silence\". Tóibín chose to first address his own homosexuality, with no great deal of ceremony, in his essay “New Ways of Killing Your Father” published in November 1993 for London Review of Books. This development must be read against the cultural climate of the time. David Norris (politician) had, at this stage, successfully lobbied the European Court of Human Rights to declare a ruling that the antigay laws in Ireland were a flagrant transgression of the European Convention on Human Rights. Such a ruling had resulted in the passing of a bill by Dáil Éireann in June 1993 that decriminalised homosexuality in Ireland. This is the context that Tóibín, as a gay writer, was emerging from, one of transition and burgeoning reclamation of a lost gay identity. This reclamation is best captured by the critic Jennifer M. Jeffers when she says 'Irish novels in the last decade of the twentieth century push the heterosexual culture to see its “inbuilt” gender identifications, needless to say, this is not a comfortable or easy process. Irish religious, gender, sexual and material precedents in fiction that overtly challenge heterosexual culture and regulation are basically nonexistent'. Thus, Tóibín's creative output - post 1993, increasingly explores themes of homosexuality in such a way that parallels his 'increasingly public self-identification as gay'.\n\n\nAmerican writer John Updike described the book in \"The New Yorker\" (2004-06-28): “Tóibín's subject is the inward James, the master of literary creation and a vast hushed arena of dreams and memories and hoarded observations”. Daniel Mendelsohn in the \"New York Review of Books\" also praised the book, referring to it as; \"unquestionably the work of a first-rate novelist – one who has for the past decade been writing excellent novels about people cut off from their feelings or families or both.\"\n\nA further comment on what distinguishes this novel from other works of Jamesian scholarship can be found in the following observation made within \"Esquire\", saying 'In \"The Master,\" [Toibin] brings James to life in a way that no straight biography could'.\n\nColm Tóibín chose to write \"The Master\" in much the same conditions as his previous novelsimplementing an uncomfortable work environment to generate a very specific work ethic. That includes a hard, uncomfortable chair and choosing to write his drafts by hand rather than with the help of modern technologies like a computer.\n\nThe impetus for the novels composition first came from his collection of essays entitled  \"Love in a Dark Time: Gay Lives from Wilde to Almodóvar\" (2002), in which an opportunity was taken for deeper rumination on the sexual identity of queer authors. In light of this study Tóibín began to understand the dramatic potential for Henry James's conflict between his interior and exterior self. However, Tóibínis often keen to point out also that \"The Master\" is not simply an exploration of James's sexuality, “I really wasn't that interested in his homosexuality other than what it offered me as a drama of renunciation.”\n\n\"The Master\" is written in the genre of Historical fiction and in a third person narrative that emphasises the intimate inner monologue of Henry James, a style of writing that The Telegraph (London)'s Benjamin Markovits refers to as 'Tóibín's speciality'. Markovits chooses to draw a direct line between Tóibín's  prose and that of the man he is depicting in virtue of their shared lucidity and precision of language, 'so fine it can render the slightest variation in mood or circumstance'.\n\nFurthermore, Tóibín's emphasis on memory and recollection is such that when coupled with James's expertly realised interiority, the reader constantly finds themselves transported with James's consciousness back to the events of the memories he recalls. Tóibín, in doing so takes us beyond the temporal constriction of the four years that the novel takes place during.\n\nTóibín provides a detailed exploration of the sexual identity of Henry James as found within \"The Master. Leon Edel\" is considered one on the most significant biographers of Henry James and within his seminal five-volume biography he chooses to present James as a wholly celibate individual, a stance that has been commonplace since it was first put forward by critic Saul Rosenzweig in 1943. The publishing of \"Henry James: The Young Master\" by Sheldon M. Novick in 2004 was one of the first significant challenge to this well-established approach to Jamesian scholarship. This pivot in critical approach was born from an increasing number of James's correspondence to young men coming to light in virtue of their sometimes veiled (sometimes not) eroticism. Tóibín chooses to follow the same tact as Novick within \"The Master\" through his exploration of the Closeted Victorian.\n\nTóibín's approach to national identity within this novel appears as a proliferation of his response to \"The Essential Hemingway\" and indeed foregrounds Tóibín'sattraction to James in the first place; “the amount of emotion living in what was not said, what was between the words and the sentences.\". This point is further clarified by Tóibín himself within his collection of essays \"All a Novelist Needs\" when he notes that 'In dealing with James's attitude towards Ireland ... and indeed towards his homosexuality, it is important to remember that he was in both instances non-practicing.' (14).\n\nThe Master was shortlisted for the 2004 Booker Prize. It received the International Dublin Literary Award in 2006, the Lambda Literary Award, the Stonewall Book Award, Los Angeles Times Novel of the Year award and, in France, \"Le prix du Meilleur livre étranger\" (Best foreign book prize) in 2005.\n\n"}

Examples of this are versions of Cinderella, Rapunzel, Puss in Boots, Sleeping Beauty, and Hansel and Gretel.\n\nWhile other collections of stories have included stories that would be termed fairy tales, his work is the first collection in which all the stories fit in that single category. He did not transcribe them from the oral tradition as a modern collector would, instead writing them in Neapolitan, and in many respects was the first writer to preserve oral intonations.\n\nThe style of the stories is heavily Baroque, with many metaphorical usages. \n\nThis has been interpreted as a satire on Baroque style, but as Basile praised the style, and used it in his other works, it appears to have no ironic intention.\n\nAlthough the work fell into obscurity, the Brothers Grimm, in their third edition of \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\", praised it highly as the first national collection of fairy tales, fitting their romantic nationalist views on fairy tales, and as capturing the Neapolitan voice. This drew a great deal of attention to the work.\n\nThis collection (Basile's Pentamerone) was for a long time the best and richest that had been found by any nation. Not only were the traditions at that time more complete in themselves, but the author had a special talent for collecting them, and besides that an intimate knowledge of the dialect. The stories are told with hardly any break, and the tone, at least in the Neapolitan tales, is perfectly caught... We may therefore look on this collection of fifty tales as the basis of many others; for although it was not so in actual fact, and was indeed not known beyond the country in which it appeared, and was never translated into French, it still has all the importance of a basis, owing to the coherence of its traditions. Two-thirds of them are, so far as their principal incidents are concerned, to be found in Germany, and are current there at this very day. Basile has not allowed himself to make any alteration, scarcely even any addition of importance, and that gives his work a special value\n– Wilhelm Grimm\nBasile's writing inspired Matteo Garrone's 2015 film, \"The Tale of Tales\".\n\nThe tales of Giambattista Basile are set in Basilicata and Campania, where he spent most of his life at the local nobles. Among the places related to the stories we find the city of Acerenza and the Castle of Lagopesole, the latter connected to the fairy tale Rapunzel.\n\nThe name of the \"Pentamerone\" comes from Greek πέντε \"[pénte]\", ‘five’, and ἡμέρα \"[hêméra]\", ‘day’. It is structured around a fantastic frame story, in which fifty stories are related over the course of five days, in analogy with the ten-day structure of the much earlier \"Decameron\" by Giovanni Boccaccio (1353). The frame story is that of a cursed, melancholy princess named Zoza (\"mud\" or \"slime\" in Neapolitan, but also used as a term of endearment). She cannot laugh, no matter what her father does to amuse her, so he sets up a fountain of oil by the door, thinking people slipping in the oil would make her laugh. An old woman tried to gather oil, a page boy broke her jug, and the old woman grew so angry that she danced about, and Zoza laughed at her. The old woman cursed her to marry only the prince of Round-Field, whom she could only wake by filling a pitcher with tears in three days. With some aid from fairies, who also give her gifts, Zoza found the prince and the pitcher, and nearly filled the pitcher when she fell asleep. A Moorish slave steals it, finishes filling it, and claims the prince.\n\nThis frame story in itself is a fairy tale, combining motifs that will appear in other stories: the princess who cannot laugh in \"The Magic Swan\", \"Golden Goose\", and \"The Princess Who Never Smiled\"; the curse to marry only one hard-to-find person, in \"Snow-White-Fire-Red\" and \"Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa\"; and the heroine falling asleep while trying to save the hero, and then losing him because of trickery in \"The Sleeping Prince\" and \"Nourie Hadig\".\n\nThe now-pregnant slave-queen demands (at the impetus of Zoza's fairy gifts) that her husband tell her stories, or else she would crush the unborn child. The husband hires ten female storytellers to keep her amused; disguised among them is Zoza. Each tells five stories, most of which are more suitable to courtly, rather than juvenile, audiences. The Moorish woman's treachery is revealed in the final story (related, suitably, by Zoza), and she is buried, pregnant, up to her neck in the ground and left to die. Zoza and the Prince live happily ever after.\n\nMany of these fairy tales are the oldest known variants in existence.\n\nThe fairy tales are:\n\n\nThe text was translated into German by Felix Liebrecht in 1846, into English by John Edward Taylor in 1847 and again by Sir Richard Francis Burton in 1893 and into Italian by Benedetto Croce in 1925. Another English translation was made from Croce's version by Norman N. Penzer in 1934. A new, modern translation by Nancy L. Canepa was published in 2007 by Wayne State University Press, and was later released as a Penguin Classics paperback in 2016.\n\nThe 2015 Italian film \"Tale of Tales\", directed by Matteo Garrone, is generally based on stories from the collection.\n\n\n\n"}

Yakky's name is a spoof of \"Yankee Doodle\". \n\nYakky Doodle (voiced by Jimmy Weldon using the same buccal speech technique used for the voice of Donald Duck) is an anthropomorphic yellow duckling with green wings who lives with his best friend Chopper the bulldog. Yakky is always one to run into danger when it is most expected. This usually comes in the form of the show's main antagonist Fibber Fox or secondary villain Alfy Gator. Chopper defends his \"Little Buddy\" fiercely, and is always ready to pound Fibber or any other enemy into oblivion if necessary. Yakky's tendency to put himself in great danger never draws a rebuke from Chopper, who presumably enjoys his protective role. One of Yakky's repeated lines is \"Are you my mama?\", and one of the songs Yakky loved to sing was \"Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay\".\n\nThe template for Yakky was Quacker, a similar duckling character voiced by Red Coffey, which appeared in a number of classic \"Tom and Jerry\" theatrical cartoons, debuting in the 1950 short subject \"Little Quacker.\" Weldon, a former children's television series host and ventriloquist, had based this character on his \"partner\" Webster Webfoot.

Many Finno-Ugric peoples are surrounded by speakers of languages belonging to other language families. The concept of Finno-Ugric was originally a linguistic rather than ethnic one, but a sense of ethnic fraternity between Finno-Ugric–speaking peoples, especially Baltic Finns, developed during the 20th century. \n\nThe four most numerous Finno-Ugric peoples are the Hungarians (13–14 million), Finns (6–7 million), Estonians (1.1 million) and Mordvins (744,000). The first three of these inhabit independent states – Hungary, Finland, and Estonia – whereas Mordovia is a republic within Russia. \n\nOther Finno-Ugric peoples have autonomous republics within Russia: Karelians (Republic of Karelia), Komi (Komi Republic), Udmurts (Udmurt Republic), Mari (Mari El Republic), and Mordvins (Moksha and Erzya; Republic of Mordovia). The Khanty and Mansi peoples live in Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug of Russia. The Komi subgroup Komi-Permyaks used to live in Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug, but today this area is a territory with special status within Perm Krai. \n\nThe traditional area of the indigenous Sami people is in Northern Fenno-Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula in Northwest Russia and is known as Sápmi.\n\n\nIn the Finno-Ugric countries of Finland, Estonia and Hungary that find themselves surrounded by speakers of unrelated tongues, language origins and language history have long been relevant to national identity.\nIn 1992, the 1st \"World Congress of Finno-Ugric Peoples\" was organized in Syktyvkar in the Komi Republic in Russia, the 2nd World Congress in 1996 in Budapest in Hungary, the 3rd Congress in 2000 in Helsinki in Finland, the 4th Congress in 2004 in Tallinn in Estonia, the 5th Congress in 2008 in Khanty-Mansyisk in Russia, and the 6th Congress in 2012 in Siófok in Hungary. The members of the Finno-Ugric Peoples' Consultative Committee include: the Erzyas, Estonians, Finns, Hungarians, Ingrian Finns, Ingrians, Karelians, Khants, Komis, Mansis, Maris, Mokshas, Nenetses, Permian Komis, Saamis, Tver Karelians, Udmurts, Vepsians; Observers: Livonians, Setos.\n\nIn 2007, the 1st \"Festival of the Finno-Ugric Peoples\" was hosted by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and visited by Finnish President, Tarja Halonen, and Hungarian Prime Minister, Ferenc Gyurcsány.\n\nShamanism has had a historically important influence on the mythologies of northern and central Eurasian peoples, including those speaking languages of the Uralic, Yeniseian, Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic language families. Among the Finno-Ugric peoples, though also in Indo-European and North American mythology, are myths about a world tree or \"axis mundi\", capped by the North Star, at the center of the world, which is encircled by a stream, the idea that asterisms were animal spirits, the idea that the land of the dead beneath the earth was also the home of spirits, and the earth-diver: a bird floating on the primary ocean that dives to bring up the land.\n\nThe proposal of a Finno-Ugric language family has led to the postulation not just of an ancient Proto–Finno-Ugric people, but that the modern Finno-Ugric–speaking peoples are genetically related. Such hypotheses are based on the assumption that heredity can be traced though linguistic relatedness. However, Finno-Ugric has not been reconstructed linguistically; attempts to do so have been indistinguishable from Proto-Uralic.\n\nR1a1a7-M458\n\nR1a1a7-M458 frequency peaks among Slavic and Finno-Ugric (maximum - Karelians, maximum among R1a - Komi) peoples.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series and for a Gemini Award in the category Best Visual Effects.\n\nDaniel Jackson discovers a Repository of the Ancients on P3X-439. However, Anubis has also discovered its location, and SG-1 must destroy the Repository to keep it out of his hands. Knowing the information contained inside might be Earth's only defense against Anubis, Jack O'Neill interfaces with the device, knowing the Ancient knowledge will eventually kill him. In Washington, D.C., new President Henry Hayes calls upon Dr. Elizabeth Weir, an expert in international politics, to replace General George Hammond for a three-month review. Vice President Robert Kinsey approaches Weir, expressing in no uncertain terms the undesirability of interfering with his agenda.\n\nTeal'c's mentor Bra'tac brings news that Anubis' fleet will arrive at Earth in three days. Kinsey believes this to be a ploy to keep the SGC running, but Weir hears out SG-1's proposal to find the Lost City of the Ancients, and with it the means to defend Earth. Bra'tac and Teal'c depart for Chulak, to find ships and warriors to aid in Earth's defense.\n\nO'Neill, under the influence of Ancient knowledge, writes down what Daniel believes is the location of the Lost City: Praclarush Taonas. Daniel realizes that there is a syllable in the Ancient language for each Stargate symbol, and thus \"Praclarush Taonas\" is a Stargate address. Sam plots the planet's location and SG-1 sets off in a Goa'uld cargo ship along with Bra'tac and a young Jaffa pilot named Ronan. Jack's condition is worsening; his actions are becoming more and more subconscious, and he is losing the ability to communicate. He gives command of the mission to Carter. They arrive at a molten planet and discover Taonas, an Ancient outpost, buried under hardened lava. O'Neill activates a hologram showing Terra Atlantus—Earth and the Lost City of Atlantis, buried in Antarctica. O'Neill removes an advanced power source from the outpost. In orbit, Bra'tac fights and successfully kills Ronan who was not a Rebel Jaffa but actually an agent working for Anubis. During the fight, Bra'tac is wounded; O'Neill heals him using the healing powers of the Ancients, then enhances the cargo ship's hyperdrive and modifies its ring transporter to be able to melt through ice upon reaching their destination at Antarctica. \n\nAnubis' scouts reach Earth, but General Hammond and President Hayes believe he is attempting to probe Earth's status and hold back the \"Prometheus\". The Goa'uld begin attacking, wiping out the \"Nimitz\" carrier group. Anubis' fleet then appears above Earth and targets its communications network; Anubis appears as a hologram inside the Oval Office and demands Earth's surrender. Kinsey attempts to escape to the Alpha Site, but Anubis dials the Stargate first. SG-1's cargo ship arrives above Antarctica and starts drilling; it is protected from a group of death gliders and Al'kesh by the \"Prometheus\", commanded by General Hammond, and its F-302s. Once inside the Ancient facility, O'Neill installs the power source while Daniel, Sam and Teal'c fend off Anubis' Kull Warriors. As Hammond orders a kamikaze run on Anubis' flagship, O'Neill activates Ancient weapons that obliterates the Goa'uld fleet. A drained O'Neill indicates an Ancient stasis chamber; as it activates, he says \"ave, amicis\" (\"goodbye, friends\").

Each episode had its own opening and closing credits, guest stars listed, writers and title. When placed on the DVD, these episodes were edited into one episode 85 minutes in length, under the sole title \"Lost City\". According to the DVD audio commentary, the teleplay was adapted from a screenplay for \"Stargate II\" when it was thought the series would be cancelled after the fifth season.\n\nIn the original screenplay, O'Neill and Carter were supposed to kiss after he resigns in the engine room of the Tel'tak. The relationship between the two characters had been a running theme throughout the course of the series, and spawned much speculation and debate as to what the ultimate result would be, but the kiss was edited out when an eighth season was confirmed.\n\nThis episode (both parts) features the only appearance of Jessica Steen as Dr. Elizabeth Weir. Torri Higginson plays the role in the eighth season opener, \"New Order\" and in \"Stargate Atlantis\". Herak, portrayed by Michael Adamthwaite, has his final appearance in this episode, after being introduced in the sixth season.

In 2018, Kroll Inc. acquired the controversial cybersecurity firm Tiversa.\n\nOn March 13, 2018, it was reported that Duff & Phelps Corp. would buy Kroll, Inc. On June 4, 2018, the transaction was completed.\n\nKroll is headquartered in New York City, and has offices in Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Eden Prairie, Nashville, San Francisco, Dallas, Miami, Loveland and Washington, D.C., as well as Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Miami office serves as the headquarters for Kroll's operations in Latin America, where it also has offices in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.\n\nKroll's London office serves as headquarters for the Europe, Middle East & Africa region (EMEA), which also has offices in Madrid, Barcelona, Paris and Milan. Their office in Dubai provides risk consultancy services to the Gulf area.\n\nKroll's Asian operations are carried out by offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mumbai, Beijing, Singapore and Tokyo.\n\nThe following are core Kroll activities:\n\nKroll acquired a computer forensics, electronic discovery, and data recovery company named Ontrack. On January 31, 2006 Kroll Ontrack Inc. announced that it has completed the acquisition of Ibas Holdings ASA, a Norwegian-based provider of data recovery, data erasure and computer forensics services. Ibas became a wholly owned subsidiary of Kroll Ontrack AS, a newly formed Norwegian entity. Prior to its acquisition by Kroll Ontrack Inc., Ibas had expanded its own geographic reach and service offerings through its acquisition of Vogon International, a privately held U.K. company specializing in computer forensics, electronic discovery, and data recovery.\n\nIn October 2016, Kroll sold the Kroll Ontrack business to LDiscovery LLC. forming KrolLDiscovery, which now operates independently of Kroll.\n\nKroll's Background Screening division provides screening services for areas such as employment, supplier selection, investment placement and institutional admissions. Kroll's Background Screening division also includes the Kroll Fraud Solutions unit, which specializes in identity theft protection and identity restoration services.\n\nKroll offers consulting services through Kroll Security Group, its Security Consulting and Security Engineering & Design division. These services include threat assessments, vulnerability assessments, physical security surveys, security disaster planning, policy and procedure development, staffing studies, etc.\n\nIn 1987, in the prominent First Amendment case over The Heroin Trail stories in \"New York Newsday\", attorney Floyd Abrams enlisted Kroll's help to find an eyewitness: \"But was it conceivable that we could come up with an eyewitness who could be of help? I called Jules Kroll, the CEO of Kroll Associates, the nation's most acclaimed investigative firm, to ask him if he could inquire, through the extensive range of former law enforcement officials employed by him, whether Karaduman was known to be a drug trafficker in Istanbul.\" Kroll came through: two weeks into the trial the firm produced Faraculah Arras, who was prepared to testify he was involved in one of Karaduman's drug deals. \"I was stunned,\" recalled Abrams.\n\nAbrams used Kroll again in 1998 to investigate claims by CNN's \"Newsstand\" documentary that sarin nerve gas had been used in Vietnam in 1970 as part of Operation Tailwind.\n\nKroll assisted in the trial of Norwegian shipping tycoon, John Fredriksen, at the end of the 1980s.\n\nKroll were responsible for revamping security at the World Trade Center after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. They also took on responsibility for security at Chicago's Sears Tower following the September 11, 2001 attacks.\nJust prior to the September 11 attacks, Kroll Inc., with the guidance of Jerome Hauer, at the time the Managing director of their Crisis and Consulting Management Group,\nhired former FBI special investigator John P. O'Neill, who specialized in the Al-Qaeda network held responsible for the 1993 bombing, to head the security at the WTC complex. O'Neill died in the attacks.\n\nIn March 1992, the Yeltsin government contracted Kroll Associates to track down and find very large sums of money that had been removed from the Soviet Union prior to the August 1991 putsch on the Russian White House. In 1992, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Timurovich Gaidar said, \"Last year saw large-scale privatization by the nomenklatura, privatization by officials for their own personal benefit.\" Gaidar called the Communists and KGB officials criminals and that a \"a vigorous search\" for the money trails from state-owned capital had flowed abroad virtually unchecked before the collapse of the Soviet Union in the summer of 1991. On March 15, 1992, the Russian government froze all capital outflows from Russia. In April 1992, Kroll Associates began their investigations with Joseph Serio heading the Kroll Associates efforts in Moscow. Also, Joseph Rosetti, the vice chairman of Kroll Associates, was in Moscow to assist. The Kroll Associates determined that more than $14 billion in 1991 real dollars had been transferred from Switzerland to New York prior to the August 1991 putsch. Also, the Communist Party of the former Soviet Union along with other government agencies, such as the KGB, had transferred more than $40 billion in 2014 real dollars out of the country. The assets of the Vneshekonombank were frozen during the investigation. However, numerous transactions occurred to bypass the capital flow restrictions often with the British Barclays Bank in Cyprus acting a money laundering center for public officials from Saint Petersburg and Moscow. According to Valery Makharadze, the government's chief inspector, many joint stock companies were formed to provide an illegal means for capital outflows from Russia, such as the Leningrad Association of Joint Ventures and KOLO. Numerous officials became wealthy Russian oligarchs including numerous former KGB officials, prominent Communists such as Oleg Belyakov and other former Communists who headed the party Central Committee department that dealt with the defense industry, as well as Leonid Kravchenko, who was the former head of the state television and radio company. Jules Kroll, the head of the Kroll Associates, uncovered hundreds of illicit transactions with massive capital outflows. This outflow of capital from the Soviet Union and Russia directly contributed to severe economic conditions in Russia during Boris Yeltsin's second term, leading to its collapse, and resulting in the age of Vladimir Putin as the President of Russia.\n\nKroll entered into a joint marketing agreement with legal service plan provider LegalShield (formerly Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc.) in 2003, to distribute an identity theft product to consumers, called the Identity Theft Shield, the first time Kroll offered a service to individuals. As of June 30, 2006, Kroll had over 560,000 customers, according to LegalShield's quarterly report. In addition to the LegalShield subscribers, Kroll's Identity Theft Shield serves about 500,000 other consumers.\n\n"}

At a building the wires enter a conduit, a protective metal pipe, and the weatherhead is a waterproof cap on the end of the conduit that allows the wires to enter without letting in water. It is shaped like a hood, with the surface where the wires enter facing down at an angle of at least 45°, to shield it from precipitation. A rubberized gasket makes for a tight seal against the wires. Before they enter the weatherhead, a \"drip loop\" is left in the overhead wires, which permits rain water that collects on the wires to drip off before reaching the weatherhead.\n\nA weatherhead termination is only used at low voltages (up to 600 volts), since higher distribution voltages require more insulation between conductors and metal enclosures. Higher-voltage connections are made through a pothead. \n\nWeatherheads are required by electrical codes or building codes.

The première performance ended with the author being jeered by a section of the audience as he bowed onstage at the end of the play. This failure largely marked the end of James' attempt to conquer the theater. He returned to his narrative fiction and recorded this memorable pledge in his \"Notebooks\" on 23 January 1895: \"I take up my own old pen again – the pen of all my old unforgettable efforts and sacred struggles. To myself – today – I need say no more. Large and full and high the future still opens. It is now indeed that I may do the work of my life. And I will.\"\n\nThe play is set in 1780s England. Frank Humber proposes marriage to the widow Mrs. Peverel, whose son is tutored by Guy Domville. The tutor Domville is planning to become a Catholic priest but learns that he is the last of his family. He starts to believe that it is his duty to marry and carry on the family line. When Mrs. Peverel rejects Humber's proposal, Frank suspects she may be in love with Domville.\n\nGuy is later about to wed Mary Brasier, but she really loves Lieutenant George Round. Once he understands the situation, Guy refuses to go through with the marriage and instead helps Mary and George elope. Domville also realizes that Frank Humber and Mrs. Peverel are in love, and commends them to each other. He will enter the priesthood, as he previously planned.\n\nJames thought this storyline of scrupulous renunciation involving the Catholic priesthood would succeed with a London audience of the 1890s. However, although the play offered many finely written lines, the whole concept was too remote and unappealing for much of the audience.\n\nThe fiasco of the first night was witnessed by Somerset Maugham, and recounted in the chapter 'Some Novelists I have Known' published in Maugham's anthology 'The Vagrant Mood' in 1952.\n\nThe play did manage to run for five weeks but never recovered from the boos of the first night. James cut his losses, returned to his fiction, and eventually consoled himself that his playwriting attempts helped make his narratives more dramatic. Critics have disagreed about whether James' efforts as a playwright actually helped his fiction or just wasted his time.\n\nTwo recent narratives have treated the failure of \"Guy Domville\": \"The Master\" (2004) by Colm Tóibín and \"Author, Author\" (2004) by David Lodge. It is also a central incident in the standard biography of James by Leon Edel, especially the fourth volume, \"The Treacherous Years: 1895–1901\".\n\n"}

He joined Hamas and became one of its top commanders. During the 2008–2009 Gaza War, Seyam was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Jabalia. Seyam was the most senior Hamas member killed in the war, and the most senior Hamas figure killed by Israel since the death of Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi in April 2004.\n\nSaid Seyam was born on 22 July 1959 in the Al-Shati refugee camp near Gaza City. His parents fled there during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War from their village home of al-Jura, near Ashkelon. Following his secondary education in Gaza City, he gained a diploma in sciences and maths, followed by a bachelor's degree in Islamic education from the Al-Quds Open University. \n\nIt is unknown when Seyam joined Hamas, but he was one of the early members. Seyam held a job as a teacher at various United Nations-run schools until 2003. He was arrested four times during the First Intifada from 1987 to 1991. In 1992, he was expelled from the Palestinian territories by Israel to southern Lebanon and upon his return in 1995, Seyam was arrested by the Preventive Security Service (PSS) dominated by Fatah.\n\nSeyam was reported by Hamas as one of the pioneer of mortar and Qassam rocket attacks on Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, which caused them to be virtually besieged from 2001 to their evacuation by Israel in September 2005. According to his fighters, Seyam was injured three times during that period, although the causes of these injuries were not disclosed. Seyam was the second of Hamas' top five officials to be killed during Israel's offensive. He had evaded at least one attempt by the IDF to kill him in late 2004. Seyam became one of the members of the Hamas \"collective leadership\" in Gaza after the 2004 killings of founders Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi.\n\nSeyam was close to Yassin and Hamas secretary-general Khaled Mashal, that latter whom he accompanied on a diplomatic visit to Moscow, Russia. After the parliamentary elections in 2006, Seyam was appointed Interior Minister of the Palestinian National Authority, forming the Palestinian government of March 2006. It also put him in charge of 13,000 police and security forces. He represented the Gaza electoral district of the Palestinian Legislative Council as a Hamas member after being elected with the most votes for any single candidate. In June 2007, he created the Executive Force, a paramilitary organization to rival Mohammed Dahlan's PSS. It played a key role in the takeover of Gaza and was praised by many Gazans for bringing order to Gaza, but accused of torture by others.\n\nHe had six children: two boys and four girls.\n\nSaid Seyam was killed on 15 January 2009 in an Israeli air raid on his brother's rented home in Jabalia. Also killed in the strike were his son, brother and two other Hamas officials: the interior ministry's security director Saleh Abu Sharkh and the local leader of the Hamas militia, Mahmoud Abu Watfah. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri stated \"Some of our leaders will fall, some of our people will fall, but the flag of resistance won't fall\" in response to Seyam's death. Hamas members stated on Al-Aqsa TV that Seyam's \"blood will be the fuel for the coming victory [against Israel]\".\n\n"}

He was the illegitimate child of the British bear hunter Llewellyn Lloyd and Lloyd's Swedish servant.\n\nAndersson grew up in Sweden. Early in his life he went on hunting expeditions with his father, experienced Swedish nature and started a collection of biology specimens.\n\nIn 1847 he started studies at the University of Lund.\n\nIn 1849 he departed for London, intending to sell his collection to raise money for travels around the world. In London he met with the explorer Francis Galton, with whom he organised an expedition to Southern Africa. On midsummer day in 1850 they arrived at the Cape of Good Hope and then travelled to Walvis Bay, in modern-day Namibia. They then trekked into the interior, at the time little explored by Europeans. They intended to reach Lake Ngami, but failed on that expedition.\n\nGalton returned home to England, while Andersson stayed in the area and reached Lake Ngami in 1853. In 1855 he returned to London, where he published his book \"\"\"\", in which he describes his travels. He returned to Africa the same year.\n\nBack in south west Africa, Andersson was hired as manager for mines in what was then called Damaraland and Namaqualand. However, he only held the position for a brief time, and continued his explorations. In 1859 he reached the Okavango River, an expedition that he recorded in his book \"The Okavango River\".\n\nAfter his return, he travelled to the Cape, where he married. Andersson and his wife settled in Otjimbingwe (in modern central Namibia).\n\nAndersson had repeated financial problems. Even though his main interests were exploration and natural history, he often needed to earn money through trade and hunting. He lacked the money needed to publish his books and Galton declined to lend him any.\n\nIn 1867, despite serious illness, Andersson travelled north towards the Portuguese settlements in modern Angola, in order to establish a better trading route to Europe. He was unable to cross the Cunene River, so he had to turn back. His condition had worsened during his journey to the Cunene and, on the return journey, he died on 9 July 1867. He was buried by another Swede, Axel Eriksson.\n\nAfter his death, Andersson's wife and children continued to live in Africa, in the Cape Colony.\n\nHis father published notes from some of his expeditions in the book \"\"Notes of Travel in South-Western Africa\"\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The incident, in which a man was imprisoned for 31 years, highlighted official discrimination against Japan's \"burakumin\" caste.\n\nOn May 1, 1963, 16-year-old went missing on her way home from school. Later that night, a ransom note was delivered to her house. The note demanded that someone bring ¥200,000 (approximately US$556 at the time) to a place close to her house at 12:00 am on May 2. Her sister, who later committed suicide, took fake money to the designated place, with many policemen surrounding the site. Although a man came to her and exchanged words, he became suspicious and escaped into the night before the police could catch him.\n\nOn the morning on May 4, the dead body of the victim was found buried in an alley on a farm. Police determined that she was raped, then murdered. The media criticized the police for failing to catch the possible suspect, the same mistake made during the kidnapping case of Yoshinobu Murakoshi, which had occurred only one month earlier. On May 6, the day before his wedding, a man from the same neighborhood committed suicide. He had the same blood type as the suspect, but he suffered from erectile dysfunction, so the police thought he could not be the rapist.\n\nNear the victim's home was the . The owner's family and most of the employees of Ishida Pig Farm were burakumin. Even among the buraku, these employees were regarded as dangerous for their history of theft and violence. The police investigated the Ishida Pig Farm employees and arrested 24-year-old on an unrelated charge. Although he denied the charge at first, he confessed to the kidnapping and killing on June 20.\n\nIshikawa and his supporters insist that the police forced him to make a false confession by isolating and threatening him for almost a month. They also insist that he could not read or write, but his ex-employer, who is also a burakumin, testified that Ishikawa could read the weekly magazines, newspapers, and books on traffic rules and automotive structure. Ishikawa and his supporters also insist that he did not have the slightest knowledge of what a lawyer was and that the police exploited that fact. Supporters claim the police fed Ishikawa false information to make him suspicious of his lawyer. Ishikawa also claimed that the police arranged a plea bargain stating that he would be freed within ten years if he confessed to the murder. In court, the police denied doing that.\n\nIshikawa was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. During his appeal, he began to claim his innocence and rejected any criminal liability. His sentence was reduced to life imprisonment. In 1969, the Buraku Liberation League took up his case, but they mostly used the situation to criticize his lawyer, a supporter of the Japanese Communist Party. The Communist Party in turn criticized the Buraku Liberation League. In 1975, Ishikawa's lawyer resigned, citing Ishikawa's anti-Communist sympathies. The battle between the two groups continued into 1976. Ishikawa's brother is the chief of the Sayama, Saitama branch of the Buraku Liberation League.\n\nIshikawa was paroled and released from prison in 1994. Along with his supporters, he is still seeking a fair retrial and the chance to clear his name. \"I want the label of murderer, which is bearing so heavily on me, removed\", Ishikawa said in 2002.\n\nSince he was a member of the burakumin, a social minority frequently discriminated against, human rights groups and lawyers claimed that the courts made the assumption that he was guilty.\n\n\nA large body of evidence indicates that Ishikawa is innocent and that the ‘confession’ upon which the courts’ decisions are based is false.\n\nFirst and foremost, Ishikawa could not have written the ransom note that was delivered to the victim's family. Like other Buraku people of his generation, he came from an impoverished background and, as a result, he was not well educated. At the time of his arrest, he was 24 years old, lacked even an elementary school education, and was illiterate. The ransom note that was delivered to the victim's house, however, contained many Chinese characters and was written by a person accustomed to writing. The courts maintain that Ishikawa could have copied the Chinese characters out of a magazine, but analysts have testified that the handwriting is clearly that of a different person. There is also no evidence of Ishikawa's fingerprints on the ransom note or on the envelope it was in.\n\nIn addition to Ishikawa's forced confession, the court has based much of its decision on the fact that the victim's pen was found at Ishikawa's house. However, this fountain pen was not discovered until the third search of his residence. On May 23, the day Ishikawa was arrested, the police came to his house, woke him up and took him to jail. Twelve detectives conducted a full, two-hour search of the premises. They took several objects from as potential evidence, but did not find the victim's pen. On June 18, a second search of the premises was conducted. Fourteen detectives participated, specifically looking for the victim's bag, watch, and pen. They searched the entire premises for over two hours but found nothing.\n\nEight days later, following these two extensive searches by a total of 26 trained detectives, the pen was found on the doorframe in Ishikawa's kitchen. Both court decisions, that of the Tokyo High Court and the Supreme Court, state that the first 26 detectives had simply overlooked the doorframe, but their reasons for why this happened differ. The Tokyo High Court said that it was because the location was too obvious, while the Supreme Court maintained that short people would have difficulty seeing the top of the doorframe. The doorframe is approximately 1.83 meters (6 feet) tall; there is a picture of the kitchen taken immediately following the second search that shows a small stepladder in front of the door.\n\nA veteran police detective has testified that it is unthinkable that trained police investigators would have overlooked a bright pink pen on a relatively low doorframe, and even more unthinkable that such a thing could happen twice. The investigators called to search Ishikawa's house were the top professionals from the area. By the time Ishikawa was arrested, the case had already become a scandal, and the police were doing whatever it took to find the culprit. They spared no cost or personnel in conducting as thorough a search as possible. Furthermore, the doorframe is mentioned in all standard police detective textbooks as a routine location to search.\n\nThe prosecutor's case rests primarily on the confession extracted from Ishikawa while he was in police custody. However, this confession is filled with statements that violate commonsense and do not match the physical layout and characteristics of the crime scene. These discrepancies, in addition to raising reasonable doubt as to whether Ishikawa actually committed the crime, also raise questions about how ‘confessions’ are drafted under the Japanese criminal justice system.\n\nThere are no witnesses who have testified to seeing Ishikawa and the girl together. This lack of testimony is odd given that the confession states that Ishikawa and the victim walked together for several hundred meters in the middle of the day. The path they were supposed to have taken led between two fields, and the day on which this was supposed to have happened also coincided with the town's annual festival, which was being held very close by. Over ten people were working in the fields that day, and the festival drew well over 800 people, some of whom would have walked along this path on their way to the festival. The people working in the fields were questioned, but none of them remember seeing Ishikawa and the girl together. No one else from the town stepped forward with such testimony either. This is all to say nothing of the implausibility of a 16-year-old high school student following an older man she did not know into a forest in the first place.\n\nThe confession states that Ishikawa killed the girl because she started to scream. In an attempt to silence her, he choked her, and before he knew it, she was dead. However, at this exact time (slightly after 4pm), a man was working in his field approximately away from where the murder supposedly happened. He was questioned by the police repeatedly and testified that, while he could faintly hear the sounds of the festival over away, he heard no screaming while he was working. In one of his last sessions with the police, he stated that he might have heard someone calling sometime before 3:30, but from the direction opposite the forest. This statement was used in the first trial as evidence that someone had heard the murder take place. The full contents of the man's sessions with the police and his exact location during the crime were not released to the defense until 1981, 28 years after Ishikawa was tried.\n\nIshikawa's confession says that the girl sustained a deep cut to her head during the struggle. However, analyses of the soil in the area revealed no trace of blood. Ishikawa had also confessed that he killed the student with his right hand, inadvertently crushing her neck in an attempt to keep her from screaming. The coroner's report states that the amount of force required to do this would have left bruises on her neck – no such marks were found. Instead, there were marks from a cloth being wrapped tightly around her neck.\n\nThe confession also maintains that Ishikawa carried the body from the forest back in the direction of the town and his home, where he tied a rope around her ankles and lowered it headfirst into a hole. The confession explicitly states that Ishikawa carried the body in front of him the entire distance, without slinging it over his shoulder. The defense team has conducted several experiments whereby strong young men try to carry a body weighing along the same path. Not one of these men was able to carry this weight for anywhere near the entire distance. A coroner has also testified that if a fresh corpse were lowered into a hole by a rope tied around the ankles, there would be marks left around the ankles. No such marks were found.\n\nThere were a number of footprints found at both the supposed murder scene and where the body was found. However, none of these match Ishikawa's.\n\nThese discrepancies and inconsistencies have been presented to the Tokyo High Court by the Sayama Legal Defense Team as part of the third appeal for a retrial of the case.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2253070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253070", "title": "Inhumanoids", "text": "Inhumanoids\n\nInhumanoids is the title of an animated series and the name of a Hasbro toy property that were both released in 1986. In the tradition of other Hasbro properties such as \"Transformers\", and \"G.I. Joe,\" the show was produced by Sunbow Entertainment and Marvel Productions and animated in Japan by Toei Animation. \"Inhumanoids\" tells the story of the scientist-hero group, Earth Corps, as they battle a trio of subterranean monsters called the Inhumanoids with the aid of elemental beings, the Mutores.\n\nThe \"Inhumanoids\" series did not begin as a conventional 22-minute cartoon, but rather as a slate of six-to-seven-minute shorts that aired as part of the collective \"Super Sunday\" half-hour block alongside other Marvel/Sunbow series, \"Jem and the Holograms,\" \"Bigfoot and the Muscle Machines,\" and \"Robotix.\" Although \"Bigfoot\" had only nine episodes, the other shows ran to 15 episodes, telling a complete story across their numerous installments, which were later edited together to form \"movies\" that were released on video. Out of the four, \"Jem\" proved to be the most popular, and was eventually made into an ongoing series that lasted for 65 episodes.\n\nThe story begins with the discovery of a monstrous creature encased in an amber monolith buried in Big Sur national park, which is recovered by the government-funded \"Earth Corps,\" a geological sciences research team. The finding spurs Blackthorne Shore, a corrupt industrialist, to clandestinely uncover a second monster buried elsewhere—a giant vine-like creature called \"Tendril,\" who attacks the amber block's public unveiling in San Francisco to release the macabre colossus trapped within, \"D'Compose.\" They rampage through city streets before fleeing into the watery darkness of the bay.\n\nThe Earth Corps member code-named Liquidator returns to Big Sur in search of further clues to the origin of these monsters, whereupon he discovers a race of sentient trees, the \"Redwoods,\" who explain that they are members of a subterranean population known as \"Mutores,\" and that their kind sealed the evil \"Inhumanoids\" Tendril and D'Compose beneath the Earth ages ago. The malevolent Inhumanoid leader, \"Metlar,\" remains imprisoned below the surface, paralyzed by the magnetic field of a Mutore duo named \"Magnokor.\"\n\nA nocturnal assault by Tendril demolishes the Earth Corps base, prompting a chase into the depths of the Earth, but even with the help of another Mutore species, the rock-bodied \"Granites,\" they are forced to retreat back to the surface. When their budget is summarily cut by Senator Masterson, a crooked politician in Blackthorne Shore's shady pocket, they are approached by Sandra Shore, Blackthorne's sister, who has learned of her brother's sinister plot to liberate Metlar. Funded by Sandra, the team constructs new vehicles and embarks back below the Earth's surface, tracking D'Compose and Tendril to the city of the Granites, where an ensuing battle frees Metlar from Magnokor's hold. Having pilfered the Earth Corps's engineering schematics via his ties to Masterson, Blackthorne joins the fray, now equipped with his own battle-suit whose magnetic powers he wields against Metlar, only to be derailed by Tendril's interference while Sandra falls victim to the mutative touch of D'Compose.\n\nEarth Corps manages to escape and forms an alliance with the Granites. Herc accompanies them to D'Compose's domain of \"Skellweb\" while Auger and Liquidator venture into Metlar's kingdom of \"Infernac,\" and Bright convinces the Redwoods to help defend the surface world against attempts by the Inhumanoids to acquire sources of power. Herc and the Granites are able to defeat D'Compose's reanimated soldiers and restore Sandra to normal. Blackthorne pursues Auger and Liquidator to Infernac and tries to use his magnetic powers on Metlar once again but is foiled by Magnokor and taken captive by Metlar.\n\nActing on information forced from Blackthorne, the Inhumanoids raid a Soviet air base, stealing a handful of nuclear missiles. A seemingly repentant Blackthorne warns Earth Corps that the missiles are intended to shatter the divide between the Earth's crust and mantle, but upon travelling into the Earth to preclude this catastrophe, the team discovers that Blackthorne has set them up and that the missiles are actually meant to detonate the planet's core. Earth Corps is able to convince D'Compose to allow them access to Infernac — a deal made easier by the fact that the Inhumanoid already fears for his own survival in the face of Metlar's insane plan — and they manage to defuse enough of the missiles to thwart the explosive scheme.\n\nFollowing a climactic battle, D'Compose is re-sealed in amber casing and Tendril is imprisoned by the Granites. Finally, Magnokor succeeds in neutralizing Metlar even as Blackthorne is arrested by Earth Corps. Senator Masterson provides the Earth Corps team with a new headquarters facility, but a \"tissue sample\" secured from Tendril during their first encounter with the monster has mysteriously gone missing.\n\n\"Inhumanoids\" and \"Jem\" surpassed their fellow \"Super Sunday\" offerings by going on to be expanded into independent full-length shows. \"Jem\" achieved the greater success, eventually running to 65 episodes spanning several seasons, while \"Inhumanoids\" lasted only one season. In both cases, to begin the series, the introductory \"movies\" were cut into five separate 22-minute episodes composed of three shorts apiece. \"Inhumanoids\" was thereafter given the series subtitle, The Evil That Lies Within, a phrase which was included in the lyrics of the opening credits of the show in every episode. A further eight 22-minute episodes were then produced to yield the standard thirteen-episode TV season.\n\nThe series proved unusual among children's cartoons of its time by the strong narrative flow that linked episodes in sequence with continuing storylines and a suspenseful threading of subplots. Visually, the show was distinctive for its application of heavy shadow, use of split-screens, and sometimes brow-raising for its gory content, such as monstrous amputations or writhing deaths by corrosive acid, which would be hard-pressed to sneak their way into contemporary \"children's hour\" programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMightiest—and most evil—of the Inhumanoids, Metlar dwells in his fiery domain of Infernac at the Earth's core. Metlar's servants are legion, consisting of \"statues\" animated by the elemental force of the Earth. A hot-headed fountain of aggression, Metlar is able to spit balls of flaming lava, yet is not without his Achilles' heel: he is particularly susceptible to paralysis by magnetism, which therefore makes Magnokor, the magnetic Mutore, his foremost nemesis. (Ancillary material: A licensed \"Inhumanoids\" storybook, \"Cult of the Great Protector,\" suggests that Metlar may also have an aversion to water: in this tale, Earth Corps' plans to lure Metlar to a cliffside which they will then blast from underfoot, dumping him into the ocean where they foresee that he will \"rust away to nothing.\" Although the plan fails, Earth Corps manages to hold Metlar at bay with a barrage of water cannons. The bio on the packaging of the Metlar toy suggests that this is his weakness as well.)\n\nSome millenniums past (in backstory revealed in episode 12), Metlar overthrew his former master, Sslither, and led the Inhumanoids against the Mutores in a war that raged across the planet. The Mutores were finally able to contain the Inhumanoids, imprisoning Metlar within a magnetic field at Granite City. Following their unearthing in the 20th century, Tendril and D'Compose made Metlar's liberation their first priority as they staged an attack to force his release.\n\nIn the midst of a battle with Earth Corps (episodes 4 & 5), Metlar was briefly reined by the magnetic manipulations of Blackthorne Shore's armour. Metlar later extracts information from Shore about humanity's most fearsome power, nuclear energy, stealing missiles from a Soviet military base in a failed bid to detonate the Earth's core. Afterwards, Metlar is once again trapped within Magnokor's magnetic field at Granite City.\n\nAfterwards (episodes 6 & 7), an A.I. computer affects the release of both Metlar and the imprisoned Blackthorne Shore. Metlar turns his wrath on Shore, who just barely manages to escape. Metlar is then forced to ally himself with Earth Corps in order to defend Infernac against a retaliatory Soviet strike, which would have destroyed the planet had it not been averted.\n\nShortly after (episode 11 & 12), Metlar's mind was affected by a chemical love potion inadvertently brewed by Earth Corps, which saw the enamored monster elope with the Statue of Liberty. Animated to life by Metlar's elemental lava, Lady Liberty unfortunately turned out to be a less-than-ideal woman, affecting a coarse New York accent and an even coarser penchant for complaint. After trouncing the reawakened Sslither in hand-to-hand combat, Metlar returns the Liberty statue to the surface to rid himself of her relentless carping.\n\nThen (episode 13), Metlar sets aside animosities with his erstwhile partners-in-crime as they plot to arrange Senator Masterson's win in the upcoming presidential election. Victory seems assured until an argumentative Auger impulsively decides to run against Masterson, with Auger narrowly winning. In retaliation, Metlar captures Auger and prepares to immolate him in the fires of the \"primal core\" even while summoning all of his foes to engage in one final battle. Yet again, Blackthorne tips his hand by seizing control of Metlar with his magnetic powers, only to be stopped by Tank. Sabre Jet manages to save Auger, and although everyone makes it out alive, Metlar and the other Inhumanoids remain at large. Metlar's voice was done by Ed Gilbert, who also voiced the Decepticon Blitzwing on \"The Transformers\" and General Hawk on \".\"\n\nD'Compose is simply an undead Inhumanoid, possessing flesh-corrupting talents and heliophobic weaknesses akin to those of a vampire. His unique appearance is marked by a dinosaur-like head and an exposed chest cavity whose gated ribcage can swing open to jail his prey. With the mere touch of his decrepit claw, D'Compose can turn his victims into frightening \"undead\" monstrosities (usually enlarging human victims to a gigantic size in the process) and they revert to normal only when exposed to daylight (known to the nonhumans in the series as \"whiteburn\"). He resides in the subterranean kingdom of \"Skellweb,\" where he commands a massive undead army. Skellweb appears to be close enough to the surface that Earth Corps is able to drill through its upper confines on two occasions to allow sunlight to penetrate.\nD'Compose was voiced by Chris Latta, also known for providing the cartoon voices of the Decepticon Starscream on \"The Transformers\" and Cobra Commander on \"\" (although unlike the latter characters, D'Compose is, usually, loyal to his leader). Chris also voiced Tendril (see below).\n\nTendril is an H. P. Lovecraft-influenced character resembling Cthulhu. A slimy hybridization somewhere between a mollusk and a walking mass of seaweed, he can regenerate his vine-like limbs — large enough pieces will even grow into new Tendril monsters — and he is able to alter his size at will. More berserker brawn than brain, intelligence is not this creature's strong suit, he exercises a slurred screeching in his speech, and is clumsy and flailing in his movement, and has less-than astute powers of observation.\n\nThis reptilian behemoth was locked in hibernation within an Indonesian temple until he was finally liberated by the machinations of Blackthorne Shore. Holding sway over both serpents and an army of unnamed monsters (similar to giant humans with animal heads and sometimes bat wings) and able to spit deadly \"electrical blasts,\" Sslither was once the ancient ruler of the Inhumanoids, relentlessly slave-driving Metlar to construct the pyramids and other ancient monuments in bitter servitude. Eventually, Metlar overthrew and imprisoned his former master. Partnering with Blackthorne, Sslither tries to settle the score against Metlar, but finds himself outnumbered by too many foes, quickly tiring of the battle and abandoning Blackthorne's charge.\n\nA brutish blue-skinned biped with a transparent stomach whose singular desire is to feed, the origins of this cyclops creature are somewhat obscure. The Gagoyle was discovered by Nightcrawler and Blackthorne Shore, who learned of the creature through \"ancient scriptures\" that directed them to a volcanic cave. There, dangerously high radiation levels served to incubate a cluster of \"Gagoyle eggs\". The first hatchling would prove to be the strongest of the brood as it proceeded to \"devour\" its nested siblings. The voracious beast soon fell under the command of Nightcrawler, who tried to use it to force Metlar's hand on the bargaining table. Metlar toppled the Gagoyle into a molten chasm where it is believed to have perished.\n\nMutores are elemental beings who long ago sent the evil Inhumanoids into subterranean confinement, presently lending assistance to Earth Corps when the monsters resurface.\n\n\nIn his past career as an archaeologist, Blackthorne Shore stumbled upon many uncanny artifacts which set him on the path that would come to govern his life — a quest for power and control of the Inhumanoids. In younger years, his search in the jungles of Borneo for an Inhumanoid temple cost him an eye — lost to a native's blowpipe dart — and he returned to America, where he and his sister, Sandra, ran their family's corporation, the \"Shore Foundation.\" His dark obsession was renewed with Earth Corps' discovery of an Inhumanoid monster entombed in amber: Blackthorne soon traces ancient documents in his possession to locate Tendril, who in turn liberates D'Compose. Blackthorne then instructs the crooked Senator Masterson to eliminate Earth Corps' funding and turn over the blueprints for their technology, using that knowledge to construct a suit of magnetic armour. He shadows Earth Corps into the subterranean depths, where he targets his armour's power against Metlar, vying to leash the savage Inhumanoid with magnetic force to make him obey his command. His vain pretensions are quashed by Magnokor, and Blackthorne's end seems imminent until he entices Metlar's interest with information about nuclear weapons, which the Inhumanoids then act on. Thankfully, Earth Corps is able to defuse the missiles and halt Metlar's plan, bringing Blackthorne into custody. Blackthorne is sentenced to five years in a maximum security prison, sharing a cell with criminal scientist Dr. Herman Manglar. However, the intelligent computer, Cypheroid, having allied itself with the Inhumanoids, soon arranges Blackthorne's escape. Donning a redesigned magnetic suit, Blackthorne once more foolishly gambles to control Metlar, scarcely managing to slip away when the furious Inhumanoid turns on him. In later dealings, Blackthorne salvages the remains of Dr. Manglar to create a ghastly accomplice in Nightcrawler, adopts the guise of \"Brother Druid\" to gather an underground cult for D'Compose's servicing, and after evading further prosecution because of a favor from Masterson, is able to release two more Inhumanoids — Gagoyle and Sslither. Blackthorne then schemes with the Inhumanoids during the presidential race, endeavoring to ensure Senator Masterson's victory for his own power-hungry purposes. When the unravelled plan incites Auger's kidnapping and a final terrible battle between Earth and the Inhumanoids, Blackthorne lies in waiting to take advantage of the closing calamity: just as Magnokor captures Metlar in his magnetic hold once again, Blackthorne turns his armour on the three of them, taking control of their movements and pitting them all against Earth Corps. Before any real damage can be done, however, Earth Corps ally Tank takes the villain by surprise from behind and forces him to desist. Though Auger is rescued, both the Inhumanoids and Blackthorne remain at large.\n\nNightcrawler was formerly known as Dr. Herman Manglar, a geneticist sentenced to imprisonment in the \"Glades Penitentiary\" for engineering monstrous creatures in his laboratory. Sharing a cell with Blackthorne Shore, Manglar was able to escape when the sentient computer, Cypheroid, engineered Blackthorne's liberation. Unfortunately, while fleeing through the swamp waters, Manglar took a misstep and met his horrific demise in a pool of illegally dumped toxic sludge. Later, Blackthorne recovers his decayed remains and enlists the morbid touch of D'Compose to reanimate Manglar in the twisted, monstrous body of Nightcrawler <nowiki>(originally named</nowiki> Toxoid<nowiki>)</nowiki>. Working from chemicals purloined by the mutated minions of Blackthorne's phony \"Brother Druid\" cult, Nightcrawler's first assignment is to apply his scientific skills toward creating a formula to protect D'Compose against the sun's burning rays. Although Nightcrawler claimed to have succeeded in his task, and indeed was unaffected by sunlight on later occasions, he and Blackthorne are arrested by Earth Corps before D'Compose tests the formula to painfully discover that it is ineffective. Blackthorne manages to buy a pardon for himself and Nightcrawler, but when D'Compose attacks their court hearing seeking retribution for the formula's failure, they realize that they will need a new Inhumanoid ally for their own protection. Once the two villains secure the beastly Gagoyle from its nesting grounds and have tamed it to some degree, Nightcrawler turns on Blackthorne, hurling him into Gagoyle's feeding pit to coerce a promise of subservience from him. Blackthorne flees during a clash with the Redwoods. Nightcrawler subsequently takes Gagoyle to strong-arm a surrender from D'Compose, but Metlar refuses to comply and Gagoyle is destroyed in their fight. Blackthorne soon makes his return with the powerful Inhumanoid, Sslither, under his control, whose threat presses Nightcrawler into forging an alliance with Earth Corps. Thereafter struck by an electrical bolt from Sslither, Nightcrawler flees the battle. Three months later, Nightcrawler teams with Blackthorne and the Inhumanoids as they set aside their differences in order to sabotage the presidential election: Nightcrawler is seen tainting a lake with hazardous waste that consumes the boat, and nearly the life, of one of the opposing candidates.\n\nA corrupt politician kept on Blackthorne Shore's moneyed leash, Masterson is introduced by first name alternately as \"Charles,\" \"Theodore,\" and \"Wilfred\" in different episodes. At Blackthorne's request, he eliminates Earth Corps' government financing and delivers the blueprints disclosing their exosuit technology to Blackthorne's hand, also arranging a full legal pardon to later excuse Blackthorne and Nightcrawler from criminal prosecution. Despite an anemic record in public service, Masterson announces his intention to run for the office of president in a press conference on Liberty Island. When Metlar arrives to make off with the Statue of Liberty, Masterson tries to exploit the situation by arranging a televised rescue effort to boost his political currency — but he ends up requiring rescue himself, later stealing credit when the Statue is voluntarily returned. Asked to define his electoral platform for the benefit of the viewing audience during a televised debate, Masterson weasels with dialogue clumsily borrowed from his two political adversaries only to embarrass himself by making an oxymoronic self-description as \"both a conservative liberal and a liberal conservative,\" exposing himself to easy mockery. Afterwards, Masterson is approached by Blackthorne Shore and the Inhumanoids, who suspend their personal feuding as they plot to manipulate the election in Masterson's favor. Victory slips from his grasp, however, when Auger of Earth Corps decides to run against him, defeating Masterson by a close margin.\n\nHector Ramirez is the Marvel/Sunbow universe's parody of Geraldo Rivera, and has, in his illustrious career, encountered \"G.I. Joe,\" \"Jem and the Holograms,\" and the \"Transformers.\" His presence on \"Inhumanoids\" tacitly links the four animated series in a shared universe. He was, however, easily most prominent in his reporting stints on the Inhumanoids, although he is not regarded as a popular public figure and is hated by Auger of Earth Corps more than most (the majority of Auger's \"shoe-through-the-television\" incidents occur when Ramirez appears on the screen). As host of the TV magazine show, \"Twenty Questions,\" Ramirez delivers crassly sensationalizing reports on emerging Inhumanoid activities. In one episode, he probes a suspect underground cult to find its members — and himself — subjected to mind-control gas before being mutated by D'Compose into an undead army, proceeding to assault his TV station. Restored to normalcy by the intervention of Earth Corps, Ramirez is initially keen to remain on the scene as an observer, but he reconsiders when awarded with threats of physical violence from Auger. Ramirez makes further appearances reporting on the disasters caused by the inversion of Earth's magnetic field and in coverage of Senator Masterson's presidential press conference. He takes a camera crew into the Earth to accompany the Masterson Team in their expedition to recover the Statue of Liberty, but three months later, Hector found his program yanked from the air due to low ratings. Professing that he could \"do junk as well as the next guy,\" Hector tries to grab some camera time by shoving aside a field reporter during live coverage of Auger's abduction and reporting on the situation himself.\n\nThis race of strange mollusk creatures dwells in abundance in a city beneath the Earth, demonstrating a culture of commerce and a special fondness (bordering on addiction) for junk food from the surface world. It is unclear if the Langastoids are Inhumanoids, Mutores, or some other breed of lifeform. Earth Corps first discovers their crude civilization during events surrounding the inversion of Earth's magnetic field, when they are captured by Langastoid guards and put up for sale on the city auction block along with their gear, eventually making a getaway on bizarre slug-like steeds with help from Tank. In their next subterranean encounter, Earth Corps was greeted more peacefully by Langastoid farmers claiming to need help against attacks on their city by Tendril, but this proves to be a deception orchestrated by the Inhumanoids, who have bribed their Langastoid lackeys with the promise of surface food. During Metlar's final stand, Tendril relies on the same fattening ploy to buy the Langastoids' allegiance in battle, but they are quickly distracted by a payload of junk food strategically dumped to occupy their attention while Earth Corps takes the fight to Metlar's doorstep.\n\nThis Hollywood movie director first crosses paths with the Inhumanoids while filming \"Primal Passions\", a schlock romance/horror movie based on the monsters' exploits: Tendril bursts onto the set, disoriented by a mind-altering \"love potion\" of Earth Corps' accidental design, and falls madly in love with the animatronic duplicate of himself which is piloted by actress Stella Blaze. When Tendril disappears into the Earth with the mechanical object of his affection, Landisburg is more concerned with retrieving the robotic prop than with retrieving his absentee actress! Landisburg was later a member of the incompetent \"Masterson Team\" sent to recover the Statue of Liberty. Some months further on, he was busily directing a TV promo for \"Congressman Gary Lung\" 's presidential campaign, whose production was cut short by an unscheduled cameo from Nightcrawler and D'Compose. His name is a conflation of those of real-life directors George Lucas, John Landis, and Steven Spielberg.\n\n\nA series of action figures based on the cartoon were produced by Hasbro and designed by David McDonald (now VP of Product Development/Design at Spin Master LTD) in 1986. The scientist figures each had an action power and all figures had \"glow in the light\" features. Metlar, Tendril, and D'Compose were 14\" figures and are the most sought after.\n\nThe original series of Mutors had a variety of toy figures: Redlen (dark redwood), Redsun (light redwood), Redwood Race (grey redwood), Granok (grey granite), and Granite Race (beige granite).\n\nA second series of \"Inhumanoids\" figures was in the works at the time of the line's cancellation. The only character confirmed to reach the prototype stage by an ex-Hasbro employee was Sslither (although the animated designs of Tank, Sabre Jet, Nightcrawler, and Blackthorne's second suit all strongly indicate that they were based on intended toys).\n\nMarvel Comics produced a short-lived \"Inhumanoids\" comic book under its Star Comics imprint in 1987, adapting the storyline of \"The Evil That Lies Within\". The series ended after only 4 issues and left readers with the cliffhanger of Metlar's escape from captivity and Sandra Shore's transformation into an undead minion of D'Compose.\n\nIn 2009, Kevin Smith was rumored to be writing a reboot for the Inhumanoids comic series, with George Pratt doing art. In 2010, Smith announced via Facebook that he was in fact not penning a script for Inhumanoids, but stated, \"\"It was a killer series back in the day, [it's] a shame it didn't last longer, had some really gruesome shit that I wouldn't mind tackling someday.\"\" Nothing has been mentioned since, though it may be a possibility eventually.\n\nThe 2020 miniseries \"\" by IDW Publishing features characters and references to \"Inhumanoids\"; for example, the Earth Corps are renamed as the Adventure-One Team.\n\n"}

{"id": "2253076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253076", "title": "Destructor (computer programming)", "text": "Destructor (computer programming)\n\nIn object-oriented programming, a destructor (sometimes abbreviated dtor) is a method which is automatically invoked when the object is destroyed. It can happen when its lifetime is bound to scope and the execution leaves the scope, when it is embedded in another object whose lifetime ends, or when it was allocated dynamically and is released explicitly. Its main purpose is to free the resources (memory allocations, open files or sockets, database connections, resource locks, etc.) which were acquired by the object during its life and/or deregister from other entities which may keep references to it. Use of destructors is needed for the process of Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).\n\nIn a language with an automatic garbage collection mechanism, it would be difficult to deterministically ensure the invocation of a destructor, and hence these languages are generally considered unsuitable for RAII. In such languages, unlinking an object from existing resources must be done by an explicit call of an appropriate function (usually called codice_1). This method is also recommended for freeing resources, rather than using finalizers for that.\n\n\nThe destructor has the same name as the class, but with a tilde (~) before it. For example, a class called foo will have the destructor . Additionally, destructors have neither parameters nor return types. As stated above, a destructor for an object is called whenever the object's lifetime ends. If the object was created as an automatic variable, its lifetime ends and the destructor is called automatically when the object goes out of scope. Because C++ does not have garbage collection, if the object was created with a codice_12 statement (dynamically on the heap), then its destructor is called when the codice_12 operator is applied to a pointer to the object. Usually that operation occurs within another destructor, typically the destructor of a smart pointer object.\n\nIn inheritance hierarchies, the declaration of a virtual destructor in the base class ensures that the destructors of derived classes are invoked properly when an object is deleted through a pointer-to-base-class. Objects that may be deleted in this way need to inherit a virtual destructor.\n\nA destructor should never throw an exception.\n\n\nclass Foo {\npublic:\n\nprivate:\n\nint main() {\n\nObjects which cannot be safely copied and/or assigned should be disabled from such semantics by declaring their corresponding functions as deleted within a public encapsulation level. A detailed description of this method can be found in Scott Meyers' popular book, \"Effective Modern C++\" (Item 11: \"Prefer deleted functions to private undefined ones.\").\n\nThe GNU Compiler Collection's C compiler comes with 2 extensions that allow implementing destructors:\n\nDestructors in Xojo (REALbasic) can be in one of two forms. Each form uses a regular method declaration with a special name (with no parameters and no return value). The older form uses the same name as the Class with a ~ (tilde) prefix. The newer form uses the name codice_16. The newer form is preferred because it makes refactoring the class easier.\n\n"}

It is a dark comedy, playing off the themes of suicide, angst, depression and promiscuity.\n\nThe story is written in the first-person narrative from the points of view of the four main characters, Martin, Maureen, Jess and JJ. These four strangers happen to meet on the roof of a high building called Toppers' House in London on New Year's Eve, each with the intent of committing suicide. Their plans for death in solitude are ruined when they meet. The novel recounts their misadventures as they decide to come down from the roof alive – however temporarily that may be.\n\n\nDisgraced TV presenter Martin Sharp, the lonely housewife Maureen (51 years old), the unsuccessful musician JJ and the rude teenager Jess (18 years old) meet at Toppers' House in London on New Year's Eve. They all want to commit suicide by jumping from the roof. Their plans for death in solitude, however, are ruined when they meet. After telling their individual stories to the others, they decide to hold off on jumping and to help each other. Thus a group of four unfortunate and very individual people forms. Jess's condition not to jump is that they help her to find her ex-boyfriend Chas. So they take a taxi and drive to the party they suppose Chas to be at. After finding and talking to Chas they decide to go to Martin's place where they find Penny, who has obviously been crying. She accuses Martin of cheating on her because he had left the party they'd both attended that evening without any explanation.\n\n\nThe next morning Jess's dad learns that the newspapers are publishing a story about Jess and Martin. Jess tells him that she slept with Martin, to avoid him finding out the truth of her attempted suicide. He takes her to task because the whole thing is very awkward for him. He is the Junior Secretary of Education and has a reputation to lose. He goes out to get an early edition of the paper and sees the story about her 'suicide pact' with Martin, so Jess's \"whole sex confession bit had been a complete and utter fucking waste of time.\"\n\nJess's father asks Martin to clear up the accusations and Martin denies that he slept with Jess. After the conversation, her father asks Martin to protect Jess and gives him money. Afterwards, a reporter calls JJ wanting to know why they decided not to jump, but JJ refuses to discuss it.\n\nLater Jess calls Maureen, and they decide to organise a meeting at Maureen's place. At the meeting, Jess suggests that they try to profit from the suicidal-report in the newspaper. Her idea is to confess to the press that they saw an angel who saved them from jumping. Martin, Maureen and JJ don't like the idea and they try to convince Jess out of talking to the press. The next morning they find out that Jess told a reporter, Linda, that they saw an angel that looked like Matt Damon. Jess also promised Linda an interview with Martin, Maureen and JJ. Although they are upset with Jess's behaviour, they decide to do the interview. Linda uses the interview to attack Martin in the press. Thus Martin is fired from his cable TV “FeetUpTV!” but he receives a second chance by promising to his boss that the other three will be guests in his show. The show is a disaster and Martin loses his job. At another TV show Jess admits that the angel story was not true.\n\nLater, JJ decides that the four of them have to go on holiday for Maureen's benefit. Martin, Jess and JJ help Maureen to find a place for Matty, her son. One week later they're on a plane to Tenerife. On the second day, Jess sees a girl who looks very similar to her lost sister Jen. Jess bothers the girl and they have a fight. Out of frustration Jess gets drunk and the police have to take her back to the hotel. JJ meets a girl that saw his old band and they spend the night together. Martin decides to leave the hotel after a fight with Jess. During his absence from the others he thinks about his life and decides that he has made no mistakes. He blames other people for how his life has turned out. In the taxi to the airport they talk about their holiday and plan another meeting for Valentine's Day.\n\nThey meet at 8 o'clock on the roof of Toppers' House on Valentine's Day. While they have a conversation, they see a young man who is planning to jump from the roof. They try to stop him from committing suicide but he jumps. They decide to go home and to meet the following afternoon at Starbucks.\n\n\nMartin tells them about a newspaper article he read according to which people who want to commit suicide need 90 days to overcome their predicament. So they decide to hold their decision until 31 March.\n\nMaureen and Jess decide to visit Martin's ex-wife Cindy to bring her back to him. Cindy Sharp lives with her kids in Torley Heath and has a new partner Paul, whom Maureen and Jess later find out is blind. Cindy explains to them that Martin made many mistakes and that he didn't take care of the children.\n\nAfter that, Jess organises a meeting in the basement of Starbucks. She invites relatives of the four. All in all, seventeen people appear, but the meeting is a disaster. Jess and her parents are screaming at each other because her mother claims that she had stolen a pair of earrings from Jen's untouched room. While they are fighting Jess runs out of the Starbucks. JJ and a former member of his band are leaving the basement to have a fight and Martin has an argument with one of Maureen's nurses because he claims that he's flirting with Penny. Maureen is the only one of the four who is still present. She talks to Jess's parents and speculates that Jen may have come back to take the earrings. The nurses Sean and Stephen help Maureen to bring Matty home and on the way Sean asks her if she is interested in joining their quiz team. At the quiz, an old man from the team offers Maureen a job in a newsagent's. When Jess comes back from her trip to London Bridge her mother apologizes for accusing her. Jess accepts the apology, seeing the hope Maureen's suggestion has given her mother.\n\nMaureen, JJ and Martin have new jobs now. Martin is a teacher, and wants to start a new life; JJ is a busker and is happy to make music again; and Maureen has started work at the newsagent's.\n\nThe ninety days have passed and they meet in a pub near Toppers' House. They decide to go on the roof again. While watching the London Eye from the roof, they realise that their lives aren't that bad. They decide to delay their final decision on killing themselves for another six months.\n\n\nThe book received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Metacritic reported the book had an average score of 55 out of 100, based on 32 reviews.\n\nJohnny Depp bought the rights to the book before it was published and hired writer D.V. DeVincentis, who previously wrote the script for the film \"High Fidelity\", to write the screenplay. Depp is also quoted on the back of the paperback edition as saying that the book is \"Masterful … some of the finest writing, and some of the most outstanding characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading.\"\n\nHowever, when the rights came up for renewal Hornby awarded them to his partner Amanda Posey and producer Finola Dwyer.\n\nThe film stars Pierce Brosnan as Martin Sharp, Imogen Poots as Jess Crichton, Toni Collette as Maureen, Aaron Paul as J.J. Sam Neill plays Jess's father.\n"}

{"id": "2253115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253115", "title": "Kashirskaya", "text": "Kashirskaya\n\nKashirskaya () is a former (future) cross-platform station complex on the Moscow Metro. It was opened on 11 August 1969 as part of the Kakhovsky radius extension, and from 1984 was an interchange between the Kakhovskaya and the Orekhovskaya branches of the Zamoskvoretskaya line. Since 2022 it is officially classed as three stations after the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line's separation, and also will be the terminus of it.\n\nThe station consists of two parallel halls of identical pillar-trispan (\"centipede\") design typical of the 1960s stations. Decoratively the halls differ from each other no more than from any other centipede stations built at the time. The eastern hall work of architects Nikolay Demchinsky and Yuliya Kolesnikova, features a grey marble coat on the rectangular pillars, white ceramic tiles on the walls (with a black socle on the tracks) and red granite floor with an asphalt on the platform edge.\n\nThe western hall is identical except the pillars are faced with brown marble, the floor is laid with grey granite instead of red and the ceramic wall has a slightly indigo shade instead of pale white. (work of architects Nina Alyoshina and Nataliya Samoylova). The station's design focus comes from its name which is ultimately derived from the Kashira Hydroelectric Station located in Kashira and for the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute located nearby. Both halls feature large metallic artworks by Z.Vetrova based on the theme of electrification.\n\nSince October 26, 2019 due to the abolition of the Kakhovskaya line, the station serves only the Zamoskvoretskaya line, the third and fourth routes do not work for passengers. In 2019, as part of the reconstruction of the Kakhovskaya line and its future inclusion in the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line, it is planned to replace the entire decoration of the two halls of the station. Their opening is planned as part of the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line in 2022.\n\nThe station is located on a major transport artery in the south of Moscow, the intersection of the Andropova Avenue and the Kashirskoye Highway, both roads later become the M4 and M6 (European routes E115 and E119) respectively and continue to the Russian south. The station is also situated on a point where two Moscow's districts meet up: Nagatino-Sadovniki and Moskvorechye-Saburovo.\n\nAs a result, from its opening it was prone to a large passenger traffic, particularly prior to the opening of the Orekhovo branch. To deal with this the station's entrance designs were altered from the usual underground vestibules to two surface ones (architect M.Fainshteina) which also double as a transfer point between the halls. For a more direct transfer there is also a central passage with a staircase out of the middle of the platform directly linking the two halls.\n\nOne of the main reasons why the Kakhovskaya line was split off from the Zamoskovoretskaya was the track layout. In 1969 both platforms were opened with one track used on each one. In 1983 the extension to Orekhovo only continued the unused tracks without making provisions for a comfortable branch service. The result was that only the northbound platform offered cross-platform interchange, which was unnecessary as the tracks would join anyway (see ). The southbound tracks branched only after the station, and the passengers wishing to change the direction of the travel had to wait for the correct train on one side of the platform. (The ratio was 1:1 initially and 2:1 after the Orekhovo branch expanded to Krasnogvardeyskaya in 1985).\n\nThere were varying proposals to solve the problem, including building a second junction prior to the southbound platform, but this would have been impossible without any disruption to the service, an alternative scenario including switching the whole line from right to left-hand side travel, but this was also dropped out of practical reasons, one of which was that all of the Russian Metro trains had driver doors on the left only.\n\nThe solution was to separate the Kakhovskaya branch into a separate line which took place on 20 November 1995 a reversal (turnback) siding was built north of the station allowing for the Kakhovskaya Line to separate. However, as the siding was built next to the Kolomenskoye Nature Reserve, environmental groups insisted it does not extend into it. This forced the siding to be slightly shorter, enough to accommodate the six car train of the Kakhovskaya Line but not long enough for the eight car train of the Zamoskvoretskaya Line.\n\nIt is planned that the tracks of the Kakhovskaya line will be extended as part of the future ring project Bolshaya Koltsevaya line. The actual path was disputed and the variation was either eastwards to Bratislavskaya and then to follow the path of the Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya line to Pechatniki or directly to Pechatniki via a more northeast path (both featuring at least one interim station). Bratislavskaya had already a provision for the future transfer set in its ensemble, but Pechatniki was chosen.\n"}

UGVs can be used for many applications where it may be inconvenient, dangerous, or impossible to have a human operator present. Generally, the vehicle will have a set of sensors to observe the environment, and will either autonomously make decisions about its behavior or pass the information to a human operator at a different location who will control the vehicle through teleoperation.\n\nThe UGV is the land-based counterpart to unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned underwater vehicles. Unmanned robotics are being actively developed for both civilian and military use to perform a variety of dull, dirty, and dangerous activities.\n\nA working remote controlled car was reported in the October 1921 issue of RCA's \"World Wide Wireless\" magazine. The car was unmanned and controlled wirelessly via radio; it was thought the technology could someday be adapted to tanks. In the 1930s, the USSR developed Teletanks, a machine gun-armed tank remotely controlled by radio from another tank. These were used in the Winter War (1939-1940 ) against Finland and at the start of the Eastern Front after Germany invaded the USSR in 1941.\nDuring World War II, the British developed a radio control version of their Matilda II infantry tank in 1941. Known as \"Black Prince\", it would have been used for drawing the fire of concealed anti-tank guns, or for demolition missions. Due to the costs of converting the transmission system of the tank to Wilson type gearboxes, an order for 60 tanks was cancelled.\n\nFrom 1942, the Germans used the Goliath tracked mine for remote demolition work. The Goliath was a small tracked vehicle carrying 60 kg of explosive charge directed through a control cable. Their inspiration was a miniature French tracked vehicle found after France was defeated in 1940. The combination of cost, low speed, reliance on a cable for control, and poor protection against weapons meant it was not considered a success.\n\nThe first major mobile robot development effort named Shakey was created during the 1960s as a research study for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Shakey was a wheeled platform that had a TV camera, sensors, and a computer to help guide its navigational tasks of picking up wooden blocks and placing them in certain areas based on commands. DARPA subsequently developed a series of autonomous and semi-autonomous ground robots, often in conjunction with the U.S. Army. As part of the Strategic Computing Initiative, DARPA demonstrated the Autonomous Land Vehicle, the first UGV that could navigate completely autonomously on and off roads at useful speeds.\n\nBased on its application, unmanned ground vehicles will generally include the following components: platform, sensors, control systems, guidance interface, communication links, and systems integration features.\n\nThe platform can be based on an all-terrain vehicle design and includes the locomotive apparatus, sensors, and power source. Tracks, wheels, and legs are the common forms of locomotion. In addition, the platform may include an articulated body and some are made to join with other units.\n\nA primary purpose of UGV sensors is navigation, another is environment detection. Sensors can include compasses, odometers, inclinometers, gyroscopes, cameras for triangulation, laser and ultrasound range finders, and infrared technology.\n\nUnmanned ground vehicles are generally considered Remote-Operated and Autonomous, although Supervisory Control is also used to refer to situations where there is a combination of decision making from internal UGV systems and the remote human operator.\n\nA remote-operated UGV is a vehicle that is controlled by a human operator via interface. All actions are determined by the operator based upon either direct visual observation or remote use of sensors such as digital video cameras. A basic example of the principles of remote operation would be a remote controlled toy car.\n\nSome examples of remote-operated UGV technology are:\n\nAn autonomous UGV (AGV) is essentially an autonomous robot that operates without the need for a human controller on the basis of artificial intelligence technologies. The vehicle uses its sensors to develop some limited understanding of the environment, which is then used by control algorithms to determine the next action to take in the context of a human provided mission goal. This fully eliminates the need for any human to watch over the menial tasks that the AGV is completing.\n\nA fully autonomous robot may have the ability to:\n\nA robot may also be able to learn autonomously. Autonomous learning includes the ability to:\n\nAutonomous robots still require regular maintenance, as with all machines.\n\nOne of the most crucial aspects to consider when developing armed autonomous machines is the distinction between combatants and civilians. If done incorrectly, robot deployment can be detrimental. This is particularly true in the modern era, when combatants often intentionally disguise themselves as civilians to avoid detection. Even if a robot maintained 99% accuracy, the number of civilian lives lost can still be catastrophic. Due to this, it is unlikely that any fully autonomous machines will be sent into battle armed, at least until a satisfactory solution can be developed.\n\nSome examples of autonomous UGV technology are:\n\nDepending on the type of control system, the interface between machine and human operator can include joystick, computer programs, or voice command.\n\nCommunication between UGV and control station can be done via radio control or fiber optics. It may also include communication with other machines and robots involved in the operation.\n\nSystems architecture integrates the interplay between hardware and software and determines UGV success and autonomy.\n\nThere are a wide variety of UGVs in use today. Predominantly these vehicles are used to replace humans in hazardous situations, such as handling explosives and in bomb disabling vehicles, where additional strength or smaller size is needed, or where humans cannot easily go. Military applications include surveillance, reconnaissance, and target acquisition. They are also used in industries such as agriculture, mining and construction. UGVs are highly effective in naval operations, they have great importance in the help of Marine Corps combat; they can additionally avail in logistics operations on to the land and afloat.\n\nUGVs are also being developed for peacekeeping operations, ground surveillance, gatekeeper/checkpoint operations, urban street presence and to enhance police and military raids in urban settings. UGVs can \"draw first fire\" from insurgents — reducing military and police casualties. Furthermore, UGVs are now being used in rescue and recovery mission and were first used to find survivors following 9/11 at Ground Zero.\n\nNASA's Mars Exploration Rover project included two UGVs, Spirit and Opportunity, that performed beyond the original design parameters. This is attributed to redundant systems, careful handling, and long-term interface decision making. Opportunity (rover) and its twin, Spirit (rover), six-wheeled, solar powered ground vehicles, were launched in July 2003 and landed on opposite sides of Mars in January 2004. The Spirit rover operated nominally until it became trapped in deep sand in April 2009, lasting more than 20 times longer than expected. Opportunity, by comparison, was operational for more than 14 years beyond its intended lifespan of three months. Curiosity (rover) landed on Mars in September 2011, and its original two-year mission has since been extended indefinitely.\n\nMultiple civilian applications of UGVs are being implemented to automatic processes in manufacturing and production environments. They have also been developed as autonomous tour guides for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the Swiss National Exhibition Expo.\n\nUGVs are one type of agricultural robot. Unmanned harvesting tractors can be operated around the clock making it possible to handle short windows for harvesting. UGVs are also used for spraying and thinning. They can also be used to monitor the health of crops and livestock.\n\nIn the manufacturing environment, UGVs are used for transporting materials. They are often automated and referred to as AGVs. Aerospace companies use these vehicles for precision positioning and transporting heavy, bulky pieces between manufacturing stations, which are less time-consuming than using large cranes and can keep people from engaging with dangerous areas.\n\nUGVs can be used to traverse and map mine tunnels. Combining radar, laser, and visual sensors, UGVs are in development to map 3D rock surfaces in open pit mines.\n\nIn the warehouse management system, UGVs have multiple uses from transferring goods with autonomous forklifts and conveyors to stock scanning and taking inventory.\n\nUGVs are used in many emergency situations including Urban search and rescue, fire fighting, and nuclear response. Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, UGVs were used in Japan for mapping and structural assessment in areas with too much radiation to warrant a human presence.\n\nUGV use by the military has saved many lives. Applications include explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) such as landmines, loading heavy items, and repairing ground conditions under enemy fire. The number of robots used in Iraq increased from 150 in 2004 to 5000 in 2005 and they disarmed over 1000 roadside bombs in Iraq at the end of 2005 (Carafano & Gudgel, 2007). By 2013, the U.S. Army had purchased 7,000 such machines and 750 had been destroyed.\nThe military is using UGV technology to develop robots outfitted with machine guns and grenade launchers that may replace soldiers.\n\nSARGE is based on a 4-wheel drive all terrain vehicle; the frame of the Yamaha Breeze. Currently, the objective is to provide each infantry battalion with up to eight SARGE units (Singer, 2009b). The SARGE robot is primarily used for remote surveillance; sent ahead of the infantry to investigate potential ambushes.\n\nBuilt by General Dynamics Land Systems, the Mult-Utility Tactical Transport (\"MUTT\") comes in 4-, 6- and 8-wheeled variants. It is currently being trialled by the US military.\n\nX-2 is medium-sized tracked UGV built by Digital Concepts Engineering. It is based on a previous autonomous robotic system designed for use in EOD, search and rescue (SAR), perimeter patrol, communications relay, mine detection and clearing, and as light weapons platform. It measures 1.31 m in length, weighs 300 kg and can reach speeds of 5 km/h. It will also traverse slopes up to 45' steep and cross deep mud. The vehicle is controlled using the Marionette system which is also used on Wheelbarrow EOD robots.\n\nA new model of the PackBot was also produced, known as the Warrior. It is over five times the size of a PackBot, can travel at speeds of up to 15 mph, and is the first variation of a PackBot capable of carrying a weapon (Singer, 2009a). Like the Packbot, they play a key role in checking for explosives. They are capable of carrying 68 kilograms, and travelling at 8 MPH. The Warrior is priced at nearly 400,000 and more than 5000 units have already been delivered worldwide.\n\nThe TerraMax UVG package is designed to be integrated into any tactical wheeled vehicle, and is fully incorporated into the brakes, steering, engine and transmission. Fitted vehicles retain the ability to be driver-operated. Vehicles manufactured by Oshkosh Defense and fitted with the package have competed in the DARPA Grand Challenges of 2004 and 2005, and the DARPA Urban Challenge of 2007. The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab selected TerraMax-equipped MTVRs for the Cargo UGV project initiated in 2010, culminating in a technology concept demonstration for the Office of Naval Research in 2015. Demonstrated uses for the upgraded vehicles include unmanned route clearance (with a mine roller) and reducing personnel required for transportation convoys.\n\nThe Talon is primarily used for bomb disposal, and was incorporated with the ability to be waterproof at 100 ft so that it can search the seas for explosives as well. The Talon was first used in 2000, and over 3,000 units have been distributed worldwide. By 2004, The Talon had been used in over 20,000 separate missions. These missions largely consisted of situations were considered to be too dangerous for humans (Carafano & Gudgel, 2007). These can include entering booby-trapped caves, searching for IEDs, or simply scouting a red combat zone. The Talon is one of the fastest Unmanned Ground Vehicles on the market, easily keeping pace with a running soldier. It can operate for 7 days off of one charge, and is even capable of climbing stairs. This robot was used at Ground Zero during the recovery mission. Like its peers, the Talon was designed to be incredibly durable. According to reports, one unit fell off of a bridge into a river and the soldiers simply turned on the control unit and drove it out of the river.\n\nShortly after the release of the Warrior, the SWORDS robot was designed and deployed. It is a Talon robot with an attached weapon system. SWORDS is capable of mounting any weapon weighing less than 300 pounds. In a matter of seconds, the user can fit weapons such as a grenade launcher, rocket launcher, or 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) machine gun. Moreover, the SWORDS can use their weapons with extreme precision, hitting the bull's-eye of a target 70/70 times. These robots are capable of withstanding a lot of damage, including multiple 0.50 inch bullets, or a fall from a helicopter onto concrete. In addition, the SWORDS robot is even capable of making its way through virtually any terrain, including underwater. In 2004, only four SWORDS units were in existence although 18 were requested for service overseas. It was named as one of the world's most amazing inventions by \"Time Magazine\" in 2004. The US Army deployed three to Iraq in 2007 but then cancelled support of the project.\n\nThe SUMET system is a platform and hardware independent, low-cost electro-optical perception, localization, and autonomy package developed to convert a traditional vehicle into a UGV. It performs various autonomous logistics maneuvers in austere/harsh off-road environments, without dependence on a human operator or on GPS. The SUMET system has been deployed on several different tactical and commercial platforms and is open, modular, scalable and extensible.\n\nThe ASSCM is a civilian unmanned ground vehicle developed in Yuzuncu Yil University by scientific project granted by TUBITAK (Project code 110M396). The vehicle is a low cost small scale construction machine which can grade soft soil. The machine is capable of autonomously grading the earth within a polygon once the border of the polygon is defined. The machine determines its position by CP-DGPS and direction by consecutive position measurements. Currently the machine can autonomously grade simple polygons.\n\nIn April 2014, the Russian Army unveiled the Taifun-M UGV as a remote sentry to guard RS-24 Yars and RT-2PM2 Topol-M missile sites. The Taifun-M features laser targeting and a cannon to carry out reconnaissance and patrol missions, detect and destroy stationary or moving targets, and provide fire support for security personnel at guarded facilities. They are currently remotely operated but future plans are to include an autonomous artificial intelligence system.\n\nTurkey's unmanned ground vehicle Weapon Platform (UKAP), developed by defense contractors Katmerciler and ASELSAN. The first concept of the vehicle is equipped with the 12.7-mm SARP remote-controlled stabilized weapon systems.\n\nIn 2015, Rostec unveiled the Uran-9 unmanned combat ground vehicle. According to a release by Rosoboronexport, the system will be designed to deliver combined combat, reconnaissance and counter-terrorism units with remote reconnaissance and fire support. Armament includes a 7.62 mm machine gun and four 9M120 Ataka anti-tank missiles.\n\nVehicles that carry, but are not operated by a human, are not technically unmanned ground vehicles, however, the technology for development is similar.\n\nThe coModule electric bicycle is fully controllable via smartphone, with users able to accelerate, turn and brake the bike by tilting their device. The bike can also drive completely autonomously in a closed environment.\n\n\n"}

Dzierzynski\"\") was the paramilitary wing of the Ministry for State Security (\"Stasi\"), the security service of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).\n\nThe Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment was called a regiment, however the elite formation gradually grew to the size of a motorized infantry division with its constituent \"Kommandos\" made up of battalions. Its role in the Stasi was the protection of buildings and high-ranking officials of the GDR government and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. It was composed of experienced and ideologically reliable men separate from the National People's Army that could be deployed to suppress rebellion and unrest.\n\nThe Guards Battalion A at the MfS (\"Wachbataillon A beim MfS\") was founded in early 1951 as an armed force to complement the Ministry for State Security (MfS or \"Stasi\"), the security service of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the \"de facto\" communist state established on 7 October 1949 from the Soviet Zone of Occupation. The GDR was ruled by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) under significant Soviet influence, but despite authoritarian measures to suppress the political opposition, threats of instability remained. The SED followed the Soviet model of creating a dedicated elite and politically allegiant armed force to protect itself. The Guards Battalion A participated in the suppression of the Uprising of 1953 against the SED's Stalinization policies. In November 1954, the Guards Battalion A was set up as the official paramilitary wing of the Stasi and its staff headquartered in Adlershof, East Berlin. In August 1961, units of the Guards Battalion A participated in the construction of the Berlin Wall. In 1967, the Guards Battalion A was officially renamed the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment (\"Wachregiment \"Feliks E. Dzierzynski\"\") in honor of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka.\n\nThe Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment's major task was the protection of the SED, especially its buildings in the capital of East Berlin, and from 1960 providing security for the party leaders' private residential compound, Waldsiedlung, located north of Berlin near Wandlitz.\n\nThe Stasi was dissolved on 13 January 1990 and its facilities and responsibilities taken over by the GDR's Ministry of the Interior (\"Ministerium des Innern\") but the regiment continued to exist. The Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment was formally dissolved on 2 October 1990, the day before the GDR was dissolved in the German reunification.\n\n\nThe Regiment was subdivided into the following commands from 1980 to 1989:\n\n\nThe sites were inherited by the Ahrensfelde guard regiment in mid-January 1989. Until then they had formed accommodation facilities for UAV units of the Ministry for State Security (e.g., backup units of VRD, BDL, HA VI, AGMS). These units were the uniformed as well as the guard and security units of the units of the Stasi (BV), not a subdivision of the guards regiment. Part of these units were merged in January 1989 into the guard regiment, which is why the site was taken over by the Ahrensfelde guard regiment. Until 1989, the guard regiment had no locations in the districts. The service objects there were guarded by the WSE, which were placed under the respective BV.\n\nThe personnel strength of the regiment:\n\nCommanders of the guards regiment were:\n\n\nMilitary service in the Guard regiment was completed as WED (abbr. \"Wehrersatzdienst\", alternative military service). The term of service for conscripts was three years. In contrast to the National People's Army, recruits were inducted in April and September / October, a month earlier.\n\nRecruits were selected from particularly politically reliable families and the express wishes of the conscripts only played a role in some cases.\n\nMany conscripts in Adlershof traditionally decorated the fence of the building next door to them (Deutscher Fernsehfunk; East German TV broadcasting) with the padlocks from their lockers when they were dismissed. These locks were removed every year.\n\nIt received the same training and equipment as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft and some of its personnel were paratroopers. It was also equipped with modern armored fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft weapons and mortars.\n\nThe guard regiment was equipped with small arms (Makarov, Walther PP, PM-63 RAK, AKM, AK-74, LMG, RPG-7) to light armored personnel carriers (SPW 60 PB, SPW, 70, PSH).\n\nStationed in the command 3 (on military Teupitz - cones), there was also a battalion of special weapons. It consisted of a company, which was armed with heavy anti-tank recoilless gun SPG-9 (in 1987, was reorganized into a rifle company), a company which is an essential weapon, the heavy machine gun (HMG-company) and had the 70mm - anti-aircraft missile armed \"Strela-2 'Company. Until 1982 there was also an artillery detachment armed with 122mm D-30 howitzer. Previously they had 85-mm PaK D-44, and 82mm mortars and 120 mm in the stock.\n\nRegulators company RSK was additionally can be equipped with the AKS74 around the shoulder stock to collapse. At least in the 1970s, the former intelligence battalion, the mortar batteries and the I-battalion with Kalashnikovs in the S version were equipped. Specialized units such as the honor companies (28. and 29 MSK of the 10th MSB) were fitted in addition to the above-mentioned weapons, rifles and sabers.\n\nThe paratrooper company, located in the reconnaissance battalion also used the small Skorpion machine pistol from Czechoslovakia.\n\nFor large events, there were as accessories batons (flexible), down from 1989 shields and helmets and chains.\n\nPersonnel transport were mainly prepared by W50 and the Ural trucks. In line with this design the vehicles of the army, however, bore the registration plates of the People's Police, with the letters stacked VP. When events were Ikarus buses used.\n\nIts uniforms were nearly identical to those of the National People's Army (NVA) and were distinguished primarily by the dark red MfS service color of its insignia and by a cuff title on the left sleeve bearing the regiment's name. Other Stasi officers wore a similar uniform, but without the cuffband. Members were selected from among the most reliable volunteer recruits and had to perform a three-year minimum service tour.\n\nThe service or dress uniform of the regiment was an army uniform made of high quality (of officers) with claret fabric collar and brown (officer) leather belt. The left sleeve was fitted with a cuffband and the words \"wachregiment F. Dzerzhinsky\".\n\nSoldiers of the MOS units typically had the following personal uniforms:\n\n\nIn command 4 - Eberswalde-Finow in Bernau contributed UAZ, professional officers and professional officers uniforms of the regular army with weapons Color black (pioneers) and (white Motorized Rifle) to camouflage the Wachregimentseinsatzes. \nThe UAZ wore the army uniform from the rough cloth.\n\nThe regiment was one of three guards regiments in the GDR. The other two were units of the regular army:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2253135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253135", "title": "Adequate Seven", "text": "Adequate Seven\n\nAdequate Seven were a Welsh band who blended music styles such as hip hop, hardcore, punk, and funk. They formed in 2000 and split in December 2006.\n\nAdequate Seven formed in November 2000 and played their first gig only four weeks later. The band drew upon a diverse selection of influences in creating their sound. In February 2001 the band released the \"Adequate Seven EP\", a 5-track EP on their own label Breaking World Records.\n\nThe band was brought to the attention of London-based label Household Name Records who featured one of the band's tracks on their 2002 label sampler, following this with the release of Adequate Seven's début full-length \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\" in March 2003 to critical acclaim.\n\nAdequate Seven embarked on several tours, across the UK as well as mainland Europe, with bands such as Hundred Reasons, Capdown, The Suicide Machines and Fishbone as well as opening up for the likes of Cypress Hill and The Slackers. In the middle of 2004, Matt (Squeak) Price and Jonny Prosser left the band to pursue other musical directions. Gavin Fitzjohn and WD Davies were recruited by the band as replacements. Adequate Seven also played Compass Point Festival in Cardiff and appeared on the BBC Radio 1 Lock Up stage at the 2006 Reading Festival (Carling Weekend).\n\nBy the time Adequate Seven split up in 2006 they had played nearly 600 gigs all over Europe and had recorded 6 BBC sessions, 2 albums and an EP. The band left a unique musical legacy which has continued to influence bands around the world. Their albums are still regularly included in lists of great but obscure records in the music press, including on the NME's list in 2012.\n\nAdequate Seven left Household Name Records early in 2005, instead choosing to release their debut single \"Splitting Up\" on Audio Rehab - a predominantly drum & bass label. According to vocalist Jamie Searle, the move was \"\"totally friendly. We still get on with [Household Name], we're totally supportive of what they do, they still support our band and what we do.\"\"\n\nTrombonist Tom Pinder added: \"\"...we felt with this next album that it was time to take some big risks for the sake for the band's continuing progress, and perhaps even for its survival. We were recording an album in late last year that we had decided to release through Household Name, but we knew exactly what would happen if we released the record with them. We'd have sold a few thousand copies over the next couple of years and we'd be able to keep touring the same circuit and perhaps break into Europe a bit more but we'd still not really have an income from the band or any real prospect of one, and therefore because of various pressures on some of us individually we'd be struggling to continue to commit ourselves fully to the band. We decided that we needed a label that could get us out there and pay for us to spend the time and money necessary to make good records. Whilst Household Name is an excellent independent label, they don't work on a scale that could accommodate those extra things.\"\"\n\nSearle was also sure to make the point that Adequate Seven would not suffer artistically from their move to the new label: \"\"...we're not about to start working with machines any time soon. We're doing exactly what we did before, which was get into the practice room, write some tunes, have a bit of a dance.\"\"\n\nThe band released the \"Splitting Up\" single on 12 inch vinyl and CD in August 2005. The track caused interest on BBC Radio 1's evening shows, including being crowned Zane Lowe's \"Hottest Record in the World\".\n\nPrior to the release of their second LP release, Adequate Seven announced that a double A-side single - \"Head Up High\" / \"Gotta Stay Focused\" - would be released on 12 June 2006 via the band's own label, Breaking World Records.\n\n\"Here On Earth\" was released on 19 June 2006. The album was named by Music News as one of ten albums that define the 21st Century.\n\nAfter rumours began circulating on the Internet about the band splitting up, Adequate Seven posted a statement confirming the rumours:\n\n\"\"After nearly six years, and nearly 600 gigs, we've come to the decision that it's the right time to call it a day.\"\"\n\nThe band released a final single, a free download of \"Set Your Sights\" and went on one final tour. The band recorded their final London gig, at the Underworld venue, and released a live album on Gravity DIP Records entitled \"Last Night in London\" in December 2006.\n\nAdequate Seven played their final farewell gig on 10 December 2006 to a sold out crowd at Cardiff Student's Union. Boom in the Diamond Industry, Captain Everything, Shootin' Goon, Get Cape Wear Cape Fly and Capdown all supported. Original members Jonny Prosser and Matt Price performed with the band during their set.\n\nMany members of the band have gone on to have further success in the music industry after the demise of Adequate Seven. Gavin Fitzjohn joined Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly in early 2007 and toured and recorded with the band for 18 months before leaving to join Paolo Nutini’s band, with whom he still plays. Tom Pinder has also played with Get Cape Wear Cape Fly since early 2008, and also plays alongside Fitzjohn with Paolo Nutini's band, including numerous TV appearances.\n\nWill Davies has had success with the Cardiff-based rock quartet Attack! Attack! who are touring the UK and Europe extensively to support the release of their first album. The band are also featured on the latest addition of Activisions \"Guitar Hero 5\" as well as having had their single \"You and Me\" included in an episode of \"Beverly Hills 90210\".\n\nFitzjohn, Pinder and Davies also play in the ska band Capital City Ska alongside Adequate Seven's former manager Matt Redd, which has also occasionally featured Pete Barnes on guitar. \n\nFitzjohn also plays with The Barry Horns and has played horns for Super Furry Animals, Manic Street Preachers and Imelda May. He also appeared in the 2018 Ghost album Prequelle.\n\nJamie Searle played with London-based hardcore band March of the Raptors with members of Fireapple Red from 2010 - 2013.\n\nBen Reynolds plays with post-indie rockers Markers, which also features members of other Cardiff bands including The Take and Douglas.\n\nJonny Prosser has played and recorded with London hip hop collective Ill Bidone and is now a session bassist and web/music producer. He is currently recording and playing live with Australian hip hop artist (and former flatmate) Cozzabags.\n\nPete Barnes is currently the media and marketing manager for the Football Association of Wales.\n\n"}

Named after René Gateaux, a French mathematician who died young in World War I, it is defined for functions between locally convex topological vector spaces such as Banach spaces. Like the Fréchet derivative on a Banach space, the Gateaux differential is often used to formalize the functional derivative commonly used in the calculus of variations and physics.\n\nUnlike other forms of derivatives, the Gateaux differential of a function may be nonlinear. However, often the definition of the Gateaux differential also requires that it be a continuous linear transformation. Some authors, such as , draw a further distinction between the Gateaux differential (which may be nonlinear) and the Gateaux derivative (which they take to be linear). In most applications, continuous linearity follows from some more primitive condition which is natural to the particular setting, such as imposing complex differentiability in the context of infinite dimensional holomorphy or continuous differentiability in nonlinear analysis.\n\nSuppose formula_1 and formula_2 are locally convex topological vector spaces (for example, Banach spaces), formula_3 is open, and formula_4. The Gateaux differential formula_5 of formula_6 at formula_7 in the direction formula_8 is defined as\n\nIf the limit exists for all formula_8, then one says that formula_6 is Gateaux differentiable at formula_11.\n\nThe limit appearing in () is taken relative to the topology of formula_2. If formula_1 and formula_2 are real topological vector spaces, then the limit is taken for real formula_15. On the other hand, if formula_1 and formula_2 are complex topological vector spaces, then the limit above is usually taken as formula_18 in the complex plane as in the definition of complex differentiability. In some cases, a weak limit is taken instead of a strong limit, which leads to the notion of a weak Gateaux derivative.\n\nAt each point formula_7, the Gateaux differential defines a function\n\nThis function is homogeneous in the sense that for all scalars formula_21,\n\nHowever, this function need not be additive, so that the Gateaux differential may fail to be linear, unlike the Fréchet derivative. Even if linear, it may fail to depend continuously on formula_23 if formula_1 and formula_2 are infinite dimensional. Furthermore, for Gateaux differentials that \"are\" linear and continuous in formula_23, there are several inequivalent ways to formulate their continuous differentiability.\n\nFor example, consider the real-valued function formula_6 of two real variables defined by\nThis is Gateaux differentiable at , with its differential there being\nHowever this is continuous but not linear in the arguments formula_30. In infinite dimensions, any discontinuous linear functional on formula_1 is Gateaux differentiable, but its Gateaux differential at formula_32 is linear but not continuous.\n\n\nIf formula_6 is Fréchet differentiable, then it is also Gateaux differentiable, and its Fréchet and Gateaux derivatives agree. The converse is clearly not true, since the Gateaux derivative may fail to be linear or continuous. In fact, it is even possible for the Gateaux derivative to be linear and continuous but for the Fréchet derivative to fail to exist.\n\nNevertheless, for functions formula_6 from a \"complex\" Banach space formula_1 to another complex Banach space formula_2, the Gateaux derivative (where the limit is taken over complex formula_15 tending to zero as in the definition of complex differentiability) is automatically linear, a theorem of . Furthermore, if formula_6 is (complex) Gateaux differentiable at each formula_7 with derivative\n\nthen formula_6 is Fréchet differentiable on formula_42 with Fréchet derivative formula_43 . This is analogous to the result from basic complex analysis that a function is analytic if it is complex differentiable in an open set, and is a fundamental result in the study of infinite dimensional holomorphy.\n\n\nContinuous Gateaux differentiability may be defined in two inequivalent ways. Suppose that formula_44 is Gateaux differentiable at each point of the open set formula_42. One notion of continuous differentiability in formula_42 requires that the mapping on the product space\n\nbe continuous. Linearity need not be assumed: if formula_1 and formula_2 are Fréchet spaces, then formula_50 is automatically bounded and linear for all formula_11 .\n\nA stronger notion of continuous differentiability requires that\n\nbe a continuous mapping\n\nfrom formula_42 to the space of continuous linear functions from formula_1 to formula_2. Note that this already presupposes the linearity of formula_57.\n\nAs a matter of technical convenience, this latter notion of continuous differentiability is typical (but not universal) when the spaces formula_1 and formula_2 are Banach, since formula_60 is also Banach and standard results from functional analysis can then be employed. The former is the more common definition in areas of nonlinear analysis where the function spaces involved are not necessarily Banach spaces. For instance, differentiation in Fréchet spaces has applications such as the Nash–Moser inverse function theorem in which the function spaces of interest often consist of smooth functions on a manifold.\n\nWhereas higher order Fréchet derivatives are naturally defined as multilinear functions by iteration, using the isomorphisms formula_61, higher order Gateaux derivative cannot be defined in this way. Instead the formula_62th order Gateaux derivative of a function formula_63 in the direction formula_64 is defined by\n\nRather than a multilinear function, this is instead a homogeneous function of degree formula_62 in formula_64.\n\nThere is another candidate for the definition of the higher order derivative, the function\n\nthat arises naturally in the calculus of variations as the second variation of formula_6, at least in the special case where formula_6 is scalar-valued. However, this may fail to have any reasonable properties at all, aside from being separately homogeneous in formula_64 and formula_70. It is desirable to have sufficient conditions in place to ensure that formula_71 is a symmetric bilinear function of formula_64 and formula_70, and that it agrees with the polarization of formula_74.\n\nFor instance, the following sufficient condition holds . Suppose that formula_6 is formula_76 in the sense that the mapping\nis continuous in the product topology, and moreover that the second derivative defined by () is also continuous in the sense that\nis continuous. Then formula_71 is bilinear and symmetric in formula_64 and formula_70. By virtue of the bilinearity, the polarization identity holds\nrelating the second order derivative formula_83 with the differential formula_84. Similar conclusions hold for higher order derivatives.\n\nA version of the fundamental theorem of calculus holds for the Gateaux derivative of formula_6, provided formula_6 is assumed to be sufficiently continuously differentiable. Specifically:\n\n\nMany of the other familiar properties of the derivative follow from this, such as multilinearity and commutativity of the higher-order derivatives. Further properties, also consequences of the fundamental theorem, include:\n\n\n\nLet formula_1 be the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on a Lebesgue measurable set formula_104 in the Euclidean space formula_105. The functional\n\nwhere formula_6 is a real-valued function of a real variable and formula_11 is defined on formula_104 with real values, has Gateaux derivative\n\nIndeed, the above is the limit formula_18 of\n\n\n"}

The station was to have been built at North End on the boundaries of Hampstead Heath and Golders Hill Park and is located on the Edgware branch between Hampstead and Golders Green.\n\nThe original Royal Assent for the construction of the CCE&HR had been granted under the \"Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1893\" but gave permission for a railway only as far north as Hampstead. Financing difficulties meant that no work had begun by the beginning of the 20th century and the company was bought out in 1900 by a syndicate led by American financier Charles Yerkes. Following the purchase, plans were revised to continue the route under the Heath to Golders Green where a depot could be constructed and where open farmland offered opportunities for property development.\n\nThe new proposals met with strong opposition from residents of Hampstead and users of the Heath who feared that the construction of tunnels would detrimentally affect the Heath's ecology. The Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead also initially objected but relented and parliamentary approval was granted for the extended route in the \"Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1903\".\n\nOne of the conditions for construction of the extended route was the provision of an intermediate station at North End, which would have been located on Hampstead Way. The station would have served a new residential development being planned to the north of the heath, but Henrietta Barnett instigated the purchase of the land in 1904 to form the Hampstead Heath Extension instead.\n\nTunnelling for the CCE&HR had begun in 1903 and the construction of the station continued to the extent that the larger diameter station tunnels and low-level passageways were excavated. However, it became apparent that the cancellation of the proposed residential development would significantly reduce the number of passengers using the station.\n\nWorks on the station were ended in 1906 before the lift shafts were dug and before any work on a surface building was done. The approach road to the station was built and now forms the first part of Hampstead Way. Services began on the CCE&HR on 22 June 1907, running through the abandoned station. The uncompleted platforms and lower passageways remain, with access to the tracks. During World War II these were used to store secret archives with access only available from the cabs of passing service trains.\n\nDuring the Cold War a shaft was dug down to the lower passageways and the abandoned station became part of the London Underground's civil defence preparations. As the tunnels were the deepest in the network it was an ideal site. The role of the control centre was to manage the emergency floodgates placed throughout the tube network at the start of World War II. During this period, the building at the top was disguised as an electricity substation through the appropriate signage. The exits from the platform tunnels are now marked as emergency evacuation routes from the Underground system, and its function is now publicly acknowledged.\n\nDue to its location near the top of a hill, the station would have been, at 221 feet (67 m) deep, the deepest on the entire Underground network. The current deepest is the adjacent Hampstead station to the southeast.\n\nThe station's alternative name derives from its proximity to the nearby famous Bull and Bush public house.\n\n"}

Hunt. It was based on the 1970 novel \"Gold Mine\" by Wilbur Smith. Moore plays Rodney \"Rod\" Slater, general manager of a South African gold mine, who is instructed by his boss Steyner (Bradford Dillman) to break through an underground dike into what he is told is a rich seam of gold. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Steyner's wife Terry, played by York. In the United States, the film was only released as part of a double bill.\n\nThe film begins with a tunnel collapse at the world-famous (but fictitious) Sonderditch gold mine outside Johannesburg, in a scene that establishes the courage of Slater and his chief miner, 'Big King', and the bond of trust between them. This is contrasted with the contempt with which some other white racist managers treat the black miners. It is soon revealed that the collapse was no accident, but part of a plan by a London-based criminal syndicate, which includes the previous general manager who is killed in the abortive first attempt and the mine-owner's son-in-law and director manager Manfred Steyner, to destroy the mine so that the foreign syndicate members can profit from share-dealing and raising the price of gold on world markets. This will be done by drilling through a deep underground greenstone wall or 'dyke' which is all that prevents an adjacent reservoir of water from flooding the mine.\n\nThe mine's general manager, an accomplice in the plot, was killed in the tunnel collapse. Steyner then interviews Slater, who at this stage is underground nanager, for the now vacant post of general manager, although the mine owner / chairman of the board Hurry Hirschfeld (Ray Milland) has the next regular man in seniority in mind as another candidate. At this point during his initial interview, Slater first meets Steyner's wife Terry at their luxurious mansion home and is attracted to her, but she does not at first return his interest. However, Steyner arranges for them to meet again, in the hope that Terry will influence her grandfather, the mine owner/ board chairman, an old curmudgeon whom she lovingly calls \"Poppsie\", in Slater's favour. The plan works, with two consequences: Slater becomes general manager, and he and Terry start a love affair. Slater, unaware of the criminal plan, agrees to carry out the drilling but is cautious enough to plant a safety charge that will block the tunnel in case of a water leak. Steyner soon finds out that Slater is having an affair with his wife, but allows it to continue because it will keep Slater away from the mine, so that the safety charge can be disabled without his knowledge.\n\nWhile Slater and Terry are holidaying together over a warm Christmas, the final breach is made in the underground dyke and a wall of an ocean of water roars into the interconnected mazes of tunnels and shafts and the mine begins to flood, trapping a thousand workers. Slater hears of the disaster on the radio news, and flies with Terry in her small private plane back to the mine making a hair-raising emergency landing on the mine access road. There is a tense scene in which Slater and Big King descend the mine, amidst rising flood waters, to repair and reconnect the electrical line to the explosive safety charge that will seal the 'dyke' hole. They succeed, but only because Big King sacrifices his own life to detonate the charge, letting Slater fall injured into a rubber boat in the flooded tunnel and escape. Meanwhile, Steyner is murdered by Marais, one of his accomplices, running him down with his Rolls-Royce limousine while they are observing the mine rescue operations from a nearby towering rubble slag debris hill after they hear on the radio station news reports of Slater's set explosive charge sealing the dyke hole and saving the mine, that their plan has unravelled. Marais then also goes over the steep hill's edge after hitting his boss, tumbling down, crashing as the car explodes, killing himself. This conveniently leaves Terry free to continue her relationship with Slater, as grandfather Chairman Hirschfeld tells him again as he is loaded into an ambulance - \"Slater, you're a maniac\"!! with a smile of accepted satisfaction within a wreath of cigar smoke as the film ends.\n\n\nThe movie is based on a 1970 novel by Wilbur Smith.\n\nThe story was based on a real-life flooding of a gold mine near Johannesburg in 1968. Smith researched the book by working in a gold mine for a few weeks. \"I was a sort of privileged member of the team, I could ask questions and not be told to shut up\", he says.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" said \"Mr Smith, an adventure writer disdainful of subtleties, blasts his way to a finale strewn with broken bodies and orange blossoms.\"\n\nProducer Michael Klinger bought the rights to it and \"Shout at the Devil\" as his follow up to \"Get Carter\". \"Actually they're both just as tough as \"Carter\"\" said Klinger of the projects. The South African government promised to co operate in filming at the mines.\n\nThe film Klinger most wanted to make was \"Shout at the Devil\". However, because it was a period film it needed a large budget. \"Gold\" was cheaper because it told a contemporary story and he ended up filming that instead.\n\nKlinger tried to set up the film with MGM, for whom he had made \"Get Carter\". The studio bought out Klinger's option for \"Gold Mine\" for £25,000, but insisted that Klinger hire an experienced writer, Stanley Price, to work on the script along with Wilbur Smith. MGM later withdrew from the project - they were pulling out of all production in Britain - and Klinger bought back rights to the novel and script. The budget of over ₤1 million was raised mostly from South African businessmen.\n\nRoger Moore was cast in the lead. It was his first film since making his debut as James Bond in \"Live and Let Die\" (1973). He was paid $200,000 plus a percentage of the profits. Producer Michael Klinger used a number of other people associated with James Bond films, including editor John Glen, production designer Syd Cain, titles designer Maurice Binder and director Peter Hunt.\n\nTony Klinger, assistant to the producer, said he tried to get Steven Spielberg to direct the movie after having been impressed by \"Duel\". However Roger Moore vetoed the choice on the basis of Spielberg's youth. \"Roger was, I think, a little insecure about his acting ability, and as a consequence was always protective of his image, like most movie stars that are less actor and more star. I guess that's why we got the message loud and clear that he turned down our first choice for the director for \"Gold\",\" he said.\n\nThe film was controversially filmed in South Africa under the apartheid regime, with scenes shot at two large mines, Buffelfontein and West Rand. \"We had to drop down two miles, which was horrendous,\" said Moore. \"It was great to start with, and I got tremendously enthusiastic about the mine, but after ten days down there it got very claustrophobic.\"\n\nSome scenes were filmed at Pinewood Studios in London.\n\nThe British film union, ACTT, put a black ban on the movie because its members were forbidden to work in South Africa. The Union suggested the film be shot in a mine in Wales instead but the filmmakers refused, claiming Wales looked nothing like South Africa. Some members defied the ban.\n\nBradford Dillman later recalled \"Susannah York, a militant liberal, used every publicity opportunity to deplore the conditions of the black miners, despite pleas from the producers to cool it.\"\n\nThe complexity of filming the final flood scenes resulted in the movie going over budget.\n\nKlinger tried to sell the film to companies such as British Lion, Anglo-EMI, and Rank, but was rejected. He succeeded in selling the film to Hemdale.\n\nThe film was popular at the box office - it was one of the 19 most popular films at the British box office in 1974 - enabling Klinger to raise finance for \"Shout at the Devil\".\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" said the film \"is everything people have in mind when they talk about a movie movie. Its hero is heroic, its heroine is beautiful and kittenishly sexy, its villains are outrageously villainous, its characters crustily colorful. It has scope, scale, surprise. It has more punch than a 15 round fight and more corn than Kansas. It is a travelogue of South Africa and a fascinating audiovisual essay on gold mining.\"\n\n"}

Capitol Records originally titled the song \"You're Gonna Lose That Girl\" in the United States.\n\nThe last song recorded before breaking off to make the film, it was composed at Lennon's house in Weybridge. In the lyrics the singer tells his \"friend\" that, if he does not value his girl, the singer will \"make a point of taking her away\" from him. To the Beatles' familiar twist beat and using variations of familiar doo-wop chords, Lennon's lead singing is set in a call-and-response with the enthusiastic answering harmonies of McCartney and George Harrison, offering a last glimpse of the early Beatles' musical home turf.\n\nThe song's bridge has a key change similar to that of the record's previous track \"Another Girl\", moving up a minor third to G major, the relative major of the tonic minor. In this case the bridge concludes a measure early, diving a semitone down to meet the verse.\n\nTo fatten the sound, McCartney overdubbed a background piano (a job that once would have been done by producer George Martin \"live\" on the backing track) and Ringo Starr added bongos, the addition of Latin-American percussion being another way the Beatles often exploited their new-found access to four-track recording.\n\nIn the film, the group appears singing this song in the recording studio. In addition to the group's familiar guitar-and-drum setup, there is also footage of Paul McCartney at a piano and Ringo Starr playing the bongos, both miming instruments they had overdubbed onto the recording. Towards the end, one of the thugs uses a chainsaw to saw a hole in the floor around the drum kit. The producer reports that they will have to re-record the song due to a buzzing noise, at which point The Beatles begin asking one another who was buzzing. As they look to Ringo, he and the drums fall through the floor.\n\nThe song was released in 1965 on the \"Help!\" album. In November 1977, Capitol Records scheduled the release of \"Girl\" backed with \"You're Gonna Lose That Girl\" as a single (Capitol 4506) to accompany the release of \"Love Songs\", a compilation album which contained both songs. However, the single was canceled before it was issued. The Ramones performed a song titled \"You're Gonna Kill That Girl\" which may have been intended as a parody of the Beatles song. The Rutles' song \"Now She's Left You\" is a pastiche of this song. Stars on 45 covered this song as part of an eight-song Beatles medley in their hit \"Stars on 45\", which went to #1 in June 1981.\n\n"}

It was originally recorded by Buck Owens and the Buckaroos, whose version reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Country Singles chart in 1963, his first chart-topper. In 2002, Shelly Fabian of About.com ranked the song number 169 on her list of the Top 500 Country Music Songs.\n\nThe song tells the tale of someone who has been jilted and because of that, can play a film part of someone sad and lonely without knowing anything about acting. It has been recorded by many other artists, including Loretta Lynn, Dwight Yoakam, and Mrs. Miller. The best-known other version is from the Beatles in 1965. Featuring Ringo Starr taking the lead vocal, it became a featured performance number of his in concert, both with the Beatles and later with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. The song was also covered by Betty Willis in 1978.\n\nRussell, originally from Mississippi, was based in Fresno, California in the early 1960s. One night, some of his friends from Oklahoma planned to do a recording session in Los Angeles and asked him to join them. In order to do so, Russell had to break a date with his then-girlfriend. \"When she asked me why I was going to L.A., I answered 'They are going to put me in the movies and make a big star out of me.' We both laughed.\"\n\nThus inspired, Russell quickly came up with a concept for a love song based around his comment. He wrote it that day, and tried to teach it to the singer he was helping in Los Angeles, but he was unable to learn it. Russell then wanted to record it himself, but his then-producer turned it down, claiming that songs about the movies were not hit material.\n\nA full two years passed before anyone recorded \"Act Naturally\". \"No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get anyone interested in it,\" Russell said.\n\nBy 1963, Russell was writing with a woman named Voni Morrison, who also worked with a Bakersfield, California-based singer named Buck Owens. After Russell played \"Act Naturally\" for Morrison, she thought it would be a natural for Owens, and she told Russell that she could get him to record it. Because no one had yet recorded it, and Russell had an agreement with Morrison to share songwriting credits, he gave her partial credit, though her only role in the song was submitting it to Owens.\n\nOwens did not like \"Act Naturally\" at first. But Buckaroo band member Don Rich heard Russell's demo version and liked it, and eventually, the song grew on Owens. One night, Russell got a phone call from Owens asking if he could record the song, and he said yes. \"I later found out that he had already recorded the song that day and just wanted the publishing rights,\" Russell said. \"I was more than pleased to give him the rights in order to get the song recorded.\"\n\nOwens recorded \"Act Naturally\" at the Capitol Studios in Hollywood on February 12, 1963, and the song was released on March 11 as a non-album single. It entered the \"Billboard\" country charts on April 13, 1963. On June 15, Owens' version spent the first of four non-consecutive weeks at number one. In all, it spent 28 weeks on the country charts. The song helped to make him a superstar; before the 1960s were over, Owens had placed 19 singles atop the \"Billboard\" country charts. The song also helped establish Russell as a songwriter, and in the 1970s he was modestly successful as a singer as well.\n\nThe Beatles recorded the song in 1965 for the United Kingdom version of their album \"Help!\", with drummer Ringo Starr on vocals – his fifth with the band. It was released as the B-side of \"Yesterday\" in the United States. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it \"an ideal showcase for Ringo's amiable vocals.\"\n\nRecorded on June 17, 1965, in 13 takes. The first 12 were evidently used to work out the arrangement; the master was take 13, the only one with vocals. It was mixed the following day. The Beatles almost recorded a song by their engineer Norman Smith, but realized that Starr did not yet have a vocal on \"Help!\" They originally recorded the song \"If You've Got Trouble\" earlier in 1965 as Starr's intended song for the album, but were dissatisfied with the results and recorded \"Act Naturally\" to replace it. It was the last cover they recorded until the \"Get Back/Let It Be\" sessions in 1969.\n\nBecause Capitol Records' version of the \"Help!\" album in the United States included only the songs that appeared in the film \"Help!\", plus incidental music from the film, the label held back \"Yesterday\" and \"Act Naturally\" and issued them as a non-LP single. As the B-side of the U.S. single, \"Act Naturally\" peaked at number 47 in October 1965. The two songs made their first US album appearance on \"Yesterday and Today\", released in the U.S. on June 20, 1966.\n\nWhen the single was reissued on Apple Records in 1971, \"Act Naturally\" had the \"full apple\" side and \"Yesterday\" ended up on the \"sliced apple\" side. That is because \"Act Naturally\" was the intended A-side and has always been listed as such in Capitol's files.\n\nThe Beatles performed the song during an appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" which was taped on August 14, 1965, and broadcast on September 12, 1965. It was also performed at the Beatles' famous Shea Stadium concert on August 15, 1965, and played at some concerts throughout The Beatles' 1965 US tour (alternating with Starr's other song, \"I Wanna Be Your Man\").\n\nThe song is closely identified with Starr and he has performed it on every tour iteration, and virtually every show, of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band, beginning in 1989. \n\nFrom Ian MacDonald:\n\nIn 1989, Owens and Starr, the two most famous singers of \"Act Naturally\", teamed up for a duet version, on 27 March. The session was produced by Jerry Crutchfield and Jim Shaw. Also creating a lighthearted music video for it, between 23 and 29 June, with them playing bumbling versions of themselves playing cowboys in a western being filmed. The video was directed by George Bloom, and produced by Ken Brown. Released on Capitol Records (B-44409), on 29 July 1989, the duet peaked at number 27 and spent 11 weeks on the \"Billboard\" country chart in the summer of 1989. The B-side was Owens playing Harlan Howard's \"The Key's in the Mailbox\". It was not the first time a member of the Beatles had appeared on the country charts: Paul McCartney had done so with Wings in 1974–75 with \"Sally G\".\n\nThe recording was nominated for the 1989 Country Music Association Vocal Event of the Year and a 1990 Grammy for Best Country Vocal Collaboration, but lost both times to \"There's a Tear in My Beer,\" recorded by Hank Williams Sr. and Hank Williams Jr.\n"}

As with all Beatles compositions by either of the two, the song is credited to Lennon–McCartney. Regarding the song's authorship, Paul McCartney said, \"I seem to remember it as mine. I would claim it as a 60-40 but it might have been totally me.\" John Lennon said, in his interviews with \"Playboy\" (1980) and \"Hit Parader\" (1972), that \"Tell Me What You See\" was written completely by McCartney.\n\nDespite McCartney's later comments – \"Not awfully memorable\", in an interview with author Barry Miles – \"Tell Me What You See\" shows the musical growth of the Beatles since \"Please Please Me\", and foreshadows their further exploration on \"Rubber Soul\" and \"Revolver\". Following each repetition of the title phrase, there is a brief instrumental break featuring a Hohner Pianet. The instrument is featured on two other tracks on \"Help!\": \"You Like Me Too Much\" and \"The Night Before\", both recorded the day before \"Tell Me What You See.\" Ringo Starr's drumming on the track is augmented with a trio of percussion instruments; a güiro, a tambourine, and a pair of claves. This is not the first time the Beatles had used additional percussion instruments to flesh out their sound, having done so as early as \"Don't Bother Me\" in 1963.\n\nEvident in the song's structure and instrumentation are the Beatles' then growing folk influence, with lyrics more mature and reflective than was standard in their earlier output. The line \"trying to get to you\" (the title of an early Elvis Presley song recorded for Sun Records, which served as inspiration for McCartney and George Harrison's composition \"In Spite of All the Danger\") reflects the band's continued love of early rock and roll. Other songs on \"Help!\", such as Lennon's \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" and the title track, also exhibit compositional growth.\n\nA verse in the song, beginning with the line \"Big and black the clouds may be\", was taken from a religious inscription that had hung in Lennon's childhood home in Liverpool: \"However black the clouds may be, in time they’ll pass away. Have faith and trust and you will see, God’s light make bright your day.\" The same inscription was parodied by Lennon in his 1965 book \"A Spaniard in the Works\".\n\n\nThe song has been covered by other artists, including Teenage Fanclub and Jacob's Trouble.\n\n"}

It was written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon–McCartney) and features McCartney on vocals. The song appeared on their 1965 United Kingdom album \"Help!\" and in the United States on the Capitol Records version of the \"Rubber Soul\" album. The song was recorded by the Beatles on 14 June 1965 at EMI Studios in London in the same session as \"Yesterday\" and \"I'm Down\".\n\nBefore its recording, the song was briefly titled \"Auntie Gin's Theme\" after McCartney's father's youngest sister, because it was one of her favourites. It is one of very few Beatles songs that lacks a bass track. The song was written around the time that McCartney and Lennon were both members of the skiffle band, the Quarrymen. McCartney has cited the song as being a form of skiffle.\n\nMcCartney has also stated, \"It was slightly country and western from my point of view... it was faster, though, it was a strange uptempo thing. I was quite pleased with it. The lyric works; it keeps dragging you forward, it keeps pulling you to the next line, there's an insistent quality to it that I liked.\" Its lyrics sound effortless and conversational, but they also contain a complex sequence of cascading rhymes (\"I have never known/The like of this/I've been alone/And I have missed\") that is responsible for the song's irresistible propulsion. According to music critic Richie Unterberger of AllMusic, \"Several songs on 1964's \"Beatles for Sale\", as well as \"I'll Cry Instead\" from \"A Hard Day's Night\", had leaned in a country and western direction. But 'I've Just Seen a Face' was almost pure country, taken at such a fast tempo that it might have been bluegrass if not for the absence of banjo and fiddle.\" \n\nMusic critic Ian MacDonald said the up tempo song \"lifted the later stages of the \"Help!\" album with its quickfire freshness.\" Capitol Records chose it as the lead track for the US edition of \"Rubber Soul\" with the intent of giving the album a stronger acoustic feel, in step with the then-current folk-rock movement.\n\n\nThe song has remained a favourite of McCartney's, as indicated by live performances during his solo career. It was one of only five Beatles numbers performed on his Wings Over America Tour in 1976. It was most recently played on his 2019 Freshen Up tour.\n\nPost-Beatles live versions appear on the 1976 album \"Wings over America\", on the 1991 album \"Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)\" and on the 2005 DVD \"Paul McCartney in Red Square\".\n\nMcCartney played a snippet of the song, with Paul Simon, during the opening monologue sequence of the 2015 \"Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special\".\n\n"}

They were given traditional small ship names used historically by the Royal Navy and served during World War II.\n\nThere were 21 ships in the \"Halcyon\" class, built in two groups; the first using reciprocating steam engines, with steam turbines in the latter. They were generally smaller versions of the escort sloops. \"Niger\" and \"Salamander\" of the reciprocating group used vertical triple expansion engines, instead of the vertical compound engines of their sisters. As a result of the increased installed power they had a half knot speed advantage, even though they used slightly shorter hulls. The turbine ships used the same shorter hulls as \"Niger\" and \"Salamander\", but with lower installed power, speed dropped back to .\n\n\"Gleaner\", \"Franklin\", \"Jason\" and \"Scott\" were completed as unarmed survey vessels, \"Sharpshooter\" and \"Seagull\" being converted to follow suit. They were all re-armed and deployed in their original role on the outbreak of war. \"Seagull\" had the first all-welded hull built for the Royal Navy.\n\n\"Halcyon\"s served in Home waters, at Dunkirk, on Arctic convoy duty, and in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nOn 3 February 1940 (Cdr.

The Commanding Officer and forty of the men were killed in the explosion.\n\n\"Halcyon\"s were pressed into service as anti-submarine escorts; this task slowly decreasing as the ships specifically designed for this task, such as s, came off the slips. \"Halcyon\"s accompanied most of the Arctic convoys, serving both as minesweepers and anti-submarine escorts.

On the afternoon of 27 August 1944, they were sweeping off Cap d'Antifer in preparation for the battleship and monitors and to engage Le Havre coastal artillery delaying the advance of Canadian troops.\n\nThe headquarters officer assigning the minesweeping project to 1MF neglected to inform the Flag Officer British Assault Area (Rear‑Admiral Rivett‑Carnac), who was responsible for defending the invasion beaches from E-boats operating out of Le Havre. 1MF was observed on a southwesterly leg of the minesweeping operation and assumed to be German ships proceeding to attack Allied shipping off the invasion beaches. The Admiral's staff requested No. 263 Squadron RAF and No. 266 Squadron RAF to attack the presumed enemy ships. The squadrons responded with 16 Typhoons armed with 20 mm cannon and High Explosive \"60 lb\" RP-3 unguided rockets. RAF pilots identified 1MF as probably friendly shipping, but upon questioning their orders were told the Royal Navy had no ships in the area.\n\nIn a well-executed attack out of the sun at 13:30, the Typhoons sank \"Britomart\" (Lt.

In North America, it was issued on Capitol Records' variant on the British release, \"Beatles '65\". The song was written mainly by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney. Lennon originally gave the song to another artist managed by Brian Epstein, Tommy Quickly, in June 1964, but Quickly decided not to use it. The Beatles recorded the track in London soon after returning from their first full tour of the United States. The lyrics typify Lennon's more introspective and mature songwriting on the \"Beatles for Sale\" album.\n\nJohn Lennon began writing \"No Reply\" in May 1964 while in Tahiti, where he was on holiday with his Beatles bandmate George Harrison and their respective partners, Cynthia Lennon and Pattie Boyd. Once back in London, Lennon finished writing the song with some assistance from Paul McCartney. On 3 June, after the Beatles had completed the recording for their album \"A Hard Day's Night\", they taped a demo of the track at EMI Studios. In the description of author John Winn, the performance was lighthearted, with Lennon and McCartney joking as they sang. Ringo Starr had been hospitalised earlier that day and was therefore absent for the recording. Winn writes that the line-up on the demo was most likely Lennon on guitar, McCartney playing drums in place of Starr, and Harrison on bass.\n\nThe demo was then passed on to Tommy Quickly, a singer who was signed to NEMS, the agency owned by Beatles manager Brian Epstein. By late September, Lennon and McCartney were stuck for new material for the Beatles' new album. Since Quickly had not issued a recording of the song, the Beatles decided to reclaim \"No Reply\" and record it themselves. According to the liner notes for \"Beatles for Sale\", the song was a candidate for the band's next single before it was supplanted by \"I Feel Fine\".\n\n\"No Reply\" is about a young man who is unable to contact his apparently unfaithful girlfriend, although he knows she is home. In a 1980 interview, Lennon recalled that the lyrics were inspired by \"Silhouettes\", a 1957 song first recorded and released by doo-wop group the Rays. Lennon added: \"I had that image of walking down the street and seeing her silhouetted in the window and not answering the phone …\"\n\nAccording to Lennon in a 1972 interview, the Beatles' music publisher, Dick James, was quite pleased with \"No Reply\": \"I remember Dick James coming up to me after we did this one and saying, 'You're getting better now – that was a complete story.' Apparently, before that, he thought my songs wandered off.\"\n\nThe song is in the key of C major. The song form is standard AABA (verse-verse-bridge-verse), without a chorus as such, but including the refrain \"No reply\". The main instrumentation on the Beatles recording comprises acoustic guitars (played by Lennon and Harrison on their Gibson J-160Es), bass guitar and drums. In addition to handclaps by all four members of the group, the overdubs included a piano part by their producer, George Martin, and electric guitar played by Harrison. The rhythm over the song's verses is partly bossa nova. The bridge, or middle sixteen, reverts to a standard rock rhythm.\n\nLennon had intended to sing the higher harmony part, as this was the original melody. However, his voice had deteriorated due to excessive use, forcing McCartney to sing the part, and relegating Lennon to the lower harmony line.\n\nIn his book, \"Revolution in the Head\", Ian MacDonald comments that the \"double-tracked vocals generate a stunning power\" in the song's \"climactic middle sixteen\", which is among the most exciting 30 seconds in the Beatles' catalogue. He describes the track as \"an enticingly downbeat opener\" for \"Beatles for Sale\". McDonald adds that the group considered repeating the section, but \"wisely\" decided that \"less-is-more\".\n\nIn 2006, \"Mojo\" placed \"No Reply\" at number 63 on its list of \"The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs\". In his commentary on the track, Chris Hillman, a founding member of the American folk-rock band the Byrds, admired the imagery of the lyrics and the \"funky, out of left-field\" rhythms played by Lennon and Harrison.<ref name=\"Mojo/101Greatest\"></ref> He added: \"There is no rock blueprint for this … This is the stuff which got us all over here to put down the mandolins and banjos and plug in and pay attention to rock again.\"\n\n\"No Reply\" was one of the eight Beatles songs covered by Stars on 45 on their medley \"Stars on 45\", which went to number 1 in the United States in June 1981.\n\nParody band Beatallica recorded a mashup of \"No Reply\" and Metallica's \"No Remorse\" entitled \"No Remorseful Reply\", on their 2001 EP \"A Garage Dayz Nite\".\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\nThe Beatles\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n"}

He describes the song as having \"mishmash\" of stylistic elements—among them, \"bluesy\" chords and country music-inspired vocals.\n\n\"Baby's in Black\" was recorded on 11 August 1964, and was the first song recorded for \"Beatles for Sale.\" Lennon and McCartney sang their vocal parts simultaneously through the same microphone. This was done at their own insistence in order to achieve a closer feel to the performance.

It received the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play of the 1936–37 season. Twenty years after the original production, Anderson adapted it into a television musical with Arthur Schwartz.\n\nThe play is named for a summit overlooking the Tappan Zee portion of New York's Hudson River, near where Anderson lived in Rockland County. The story was inspired by the real life controversy over quarrying the palisades along the lower Hudson. The play also shares the plot element of a ghostly crew of Dutch sailors on the Hudson with Washington Irving's short story \"Rip Van Winkle\".\n\nAnderson began writing the play in May 1936. It was first presented onstage in Cleveland, Ohio, in December 1936, with Burgess Meredith (Anderson's neighbor in Rockland County) and Peggy Ashcroft in the lead roles. The production moved to Broadway ten days later in January 1937, where it played 171 performances.\n\n\"High Tor\" received the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for the best American play of the 1936–1937 season. The award included this citation:\n\nIn 1942, Anderson helped organize and served as the chairman of the Rockland County Committee To Save High Tor, which helped raise money to purchase the property in 1943 for the creation of a public park.\n\nThe play was broadcast as an episode of \"The Philco Television Playhouse\" on NBC, September 10, 1950, with Alfred Ryder and Felicia Monteleagre in the lead roles.\n\nAnderson first considered a musical adaptation of \"High Tor\" for television in 1949. He and John Monks Jr. adapted the play as a made-for-television musical fantasy in 1955, with music by Arthur Schwartz and lyrics by Anderson. \"High Tor\" was filmed in November 1955 by Desilu Productions at the RKO-Pathé Studio, and broadcast March 10, 1956 on the CBS television network, as a 90-minute episode of the series \"Ford Star Jubilee\". Bing Crosby, Julie Andrews, Nancy Olson, Hans Conreid, and Keenan Wynn starred in the film, produced by Arthur Schwartz, and directed by James Neilson.\n\nBing Crosby had seen Julie Andrews in her Broadway debut in \"The Boy Friend\", and invited her to appear in \"High Tor\". It was Andrews' first work in a filmed production, and her American television debut. Because Crosby was uncomfortable with the exigencies of live television, he insisted that it be filmed instead. For this reason, \"High Tor\" is sometimes considered the first TV movie.\n\nMaxwell Anderson had little interest in television, and considered his adaptation a \"potboiling job\". Julie Andrews later wrote that she thought her performance was \"very stilted\", and, \"Alas, \"High Tor\" was not a memorable piece, and received only lukewarm reviews.\"\n\nThe song score of the show, with story narration by Bing Crosby, was released by Decca Records in 1956.\n\nThe young Stephen Sondheim also set a musical version, but the author refused permission, so the musical was never produced. Subsequent copyright extension acts mean the music will be illegal until 2042.\n\nVan Van Dorn (Crosby) owns a summit (\"High Tor\") overlooking the Hudson River in New York. Van Dorn is under pressure to sell his real estate, and, at the same time, is having doubts about his impending marriage to Judith (Olson). Judith leaves him because she feels that he should sell High Tor, as the profits would provide for their future. A freak rock slide traps Van Dorn and the real estate agents on High Tor; as Van searches for help, he meets the spirit of a Dutch girl by the name of Lisa (Andrews). Lisa and the spirits of Dutch sailors have inhabited High Tor for over 300 years since they were killed in a shipwreck. Lisa then falls in love with Van. Songs include \"Once Upon a Long Ago\", a duet for Crosby and Andrews, \"Sad is the Life of a Sailor's Wife\", a solo for Andrews, and \"When You're in Love\".\n\n\nSee also High Tor (album)\n\nThe reviews were not good although the show did achieve a rating of 29.4 against the competition of a Jimmy Durante show (13.7). Daily Variety opined, inter alia: \"Somewhere in the double translation - from stage to tv-pix terms and from dramatic to musical comedy form - much of what made ‘High Tor’ a Broadway success seems to have got lost. What emerges on the home screens in this film, said to have cost upwards of $500,000, is essentially, a listless exercise, with rather undistinguished musical and murky philosophising, leavened only by the stingiest pinches of comedy.\" Jack Gould writing in The New York Times said, \"Bing Crosby badly miscast himself in undertaking a filmed musical version of Maxwell Anderson’s fantasy, “High Tor,” presented on Saturday evening over Channel 2. The motion picture, especially made for television use, was embarrassingly awkward and inept, a dismaying “quickie” unworthy of the Old Groaner’s time and talents.\n\n\"High Tor\" was presented on \"Lux Summer Theatre\" June 1, 1953.

The first day was August 14, where they recorded four takes (of which, one and four appear on \"Beatles Anthology 1\"). They also recorded on October 18, again in four takes, the last two of which showcased McCartney on Hammond organ.\n\nThough Lennon's vocals have been described as \"blistering\" , the song is held by many as one of the least successful songs in The Beatles' catalogue.\n\nIn regard to the backlash the cover received, author and Beatles enthusiast Dave Rybaczewski stated:\n\nThe \"Anthology 1\"-version further points at the 'gaudiness' of the track: instead of an organ, the solo was originally played \"on comically quivering slide guitar by Harrison\", in Ian MacDonald's assessment.\n\n\n"}

(Goin' Back to Birmingham)\", was written by Little Richard and recorded on May 9, 1956 at J&M Studio, New Orleans, Louisiana (supervised by Bumps Blackwell).\n\nIn 1955, Little Richard recorded two different versions of \"Kansas City\" by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller: one on September, 13 (supervised by Bumps Blackwell), and one on November, 29 (with five vocalists, supervised by Art Rupe). The first version, which adheres closely to the original 1952 recording by Little Willie Littlefield for the first two verses, was not released until November 1970, on the compilation album \"Well Alright!\" The second version, which had been substantially re-worked by Little Richard (in particular, it featured a new refrain starting with words, \"Hey, hey, hey, hey; Hey baby, hey child, hey now\") was released in March 1959 on \"The Fabulous Little Richard\" and in April 1959 as single after the success of the Wilbert Harrison hit.\n\n\"Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey\" was recorded six months after the second version of \"Kansas City\", incorporating the same refrain. However, as \"Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey\" was released in 1958—with the writing credited solely to Richard Wayne Penniman (Little Richard)—the public perceived it as an earlier recording than \"Kansas City\".\n\nIn 1964, The Beatles released the albums \"Beatles for Sale\" (in the UK) and \"Beatles VI\" (in the US) featuring an arrangement of \"Kansas City\" based on the issued Little Richard version. (They had performed it as early as September 5, 1962 at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, and in December of that year at the Star-Club in Hamburg.) Attorneys representing Little Richard's publisher, Venice Music, issued a complaint, claiming the Beatles' recording also included \"Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey\". As a result, the record label was revised to read: \"Medley: (a) Kansas City (Leiber/Stoller) (P)1964 Macmelodies Ltd./KPM; (b) Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey (Penniman) Venice Mus. Ltd. (P)1964.\" This was despite the fact that, when Little Richard recorded \"Kansas City\" in November 1955, \"Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey\" had not yet been written or recorded.\n\nwith:\nIt was released in January 1958 as B-side of Specialty single 624 \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\" and in July 1958 on \"Little Richard\".\n\n\"Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey\" was covered as \"Going Back to Birmingham\" by Ten Years After on their 1974 album \"Positive Vibrations\". Bob Seger recorded a version of the song in the same session that produced his cover of Fats Domino's \"Blue Monday\" for the 1989 \"Road House\" soundtrack album. Seger's take remained unreleased until 2011, when it was released as the lead single on the retrospective album \"\". Seger stated that the track hit number one on classic rock radio, less than two months after its release.\nThe song was covered by The Libertines in a one-off Radio 1 Live set in September 2003. The Jim Jones Revue recorded it for their 2008 debut album and performed it as a staple of their live shows.\n"}

He was descended from an old Hanoverian family, his father, Karl von Bennigsen, was an officer in the Hanoverian army who rose to the rank of general and also held diplomatic appointments. The anthropologist Moritz von Leonhardi was his nephew.\n\nAfter studying at the University of Göttingen, where he became a member of the Corps Hannovera, Bennigsen entered the Hanoverian civil service. In 1855, he was elected a member of the second chamber, and because the government refused to allow him leave of absence from his official duties, he resigned his post in the public service. He at once became the recognized leader of the Liberal opposition to the reactionary government, but should be distinguished from Alexander Levin, Count of Bennigsen, a member of the same family and son of the distinguished Russian General Bennigsen, who was also one of the parliamentary leaders at the time, serving as Hanover's minister-president between 1848 and 1850 and afterwards as president first of the first chamber, then of the second chamber of the Estates Assembly of the Kingdom of Hanover (parliament).\n\nWhat gave Bennigsen his importance not only in Hanover, but throughout the whole of Germany, was the foundation of the German National Association, which was due to him, and of which he was president. This society, which arose out of the public excitement created by the Austro-Sardinian War, had for its object the formation of a national party which should strive for the unity and the constitutional liberty of the whole Fatherland. It united the moderate Liberals throughout Germany, and at once became a great political power, notwithstanding all the efforts of the governments, and especially of King George V of Hanover to suppress it. Bennigsen was also one of the founders of the Protestantenverein in 1863.\n\nIn 1866 Bennigsen, then leader of the liberal opposition in the second chamber of the Estates Assembly, used all his influence to keep Hanover neutral in the Austro-Prussian War, but in vain. He took no part in the war, but his brother, who was an officer in the Prussian army, was killed in Bohemia. In May of this year he had an important interview with Bismarck, who wished to secure his support for the reform of the German Confederation, and after the war was over at once accepted the position of a Prussian subject, taking his seat in the diet (parliament) of the North German Confederation and in the Prussian House of Representatives. He used his influence to procure as much autonomy as possible for the province of Hanover, but was a strong opponent of the Guelph Party. He was one of the three Hanoverians, Ludwig Windthorst and Johann von Miquel being the other two, who at once won for the representatives of the conquered province the lead in both the Prussian and North German parliaments. The Nationalverein, its work being done, was now dissolved; but Bennigsen was chiefly instrumental in founding a new political party, the National Liberals, who, while they supported Bismarck's national policy, hoped to secure the constitutional development of the country.\n\nFor the next thirty years Bennigsen was president of the party, and was the most influential of the parliamentary leaders. It was chiefly owing to him that the building up of the internal institutions of the empire was carried on without the open breach between Bismarck and the parliament, which was often imminent. Many amendments suggested by him were introduced in the debates on the constitution; in 1870 he undertook a mission to Southern Germany to strengthen the national party there, and was consulted by Bismarck while at Versailles. It was he who brought about the compromise on the military bill in 1874. In 1877 he was offered the post of vice-chancellor with a seat in the Prussian ministry, but refused it because Bismarck or the king would not agree to his conditions. From this time his relations with the government were less friendly, and in 1878 he brought about the rejection of the first Socialist Bill.\n\nIn 1883 he resigned his seat in parliament owing to the reactionary measures of the government, which made it impossible for him to continue his former co-operation with Bismarck, but returned in 1887 to support the coalition of national parties. One of the first acts of the Emperor Wilhelm II was to appoint him upper president of the Province of Hanover. In 1897 he resigned this post and retired from public life. He died on 7 August 1902.\n"}

The Diamonds also performed the song live on the ABC television show \"Circus Time\" on June 27, 1957, and included it on the 1962 Mercury LP album \"Pop Hits\" (MGW 12178).\n\nThe Beatles recorded a cover version of the song on October 18, 1964 for the UK album \"Beatles for Sale\". It first appeared in the U.S. on the album \"Beatles VI\". It was also on a 7-inch extended play, \"Beatles for Sale No. 2\", released by Parlophone/EMI in 1965. John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were fans of Holly, sang in harmony with George Harrison, holding to the vocal and instrumental sound of Holly's original as well as they could. Before their big break, the group had performed the song live between 1958 and 1962, with Lennon and Harrison singing. For the official release, though, Lennon and McCartney shared vocal duties.

Both songs became rockabilly classics. Bill Dahl of Allmusic praised the song saying, \"'Honey Don't' actually outclasses its more celebrated platter-mate in some ways.\" It has been covered by more than 20 other artists, including The Beatles, Ronnie Hawkins and Johnny Rivers. The song also appeared in the movies \"Prince of Tides\", \"Diner\", and \"Perfect Sisters\".\n\nAccording to David McGee, author of \"Go, Cat, Go! The Life and Times of Carl Perkins, the King of Rockabilly\", Carl Perkins first brought the song to a rehearsal with his band which at the time comprised the Perkins brothers and W.S. Holland:\n\nWhen Carl first played the song to Jay Perkins, Jay protested what sounded to him like an odd chord choice, going to a C7 chord after the E instead of the natural blues progression choice of A. At first, Jay refused to go along, but Carl convinced him it was something different, and today the chord choice is one of the most interesting aspects of the song.\n\nPerkins and his band performed the song, along with \"Blue Suede Shoes\", during their television debut on ABC-TV's \"Ozark Jubilee\" on March 17, 1956.\n\nThe Beatles recorded their version on 26 October 1964 one of the last songs recorded for \"Beatles for Sale\", which was released in the United Kingdom on 4 December 1964.

During the song, he makes self-referential remarks leading into George Harrison's guitar riffs, saying, \"Rock on George, one time for me!\" and then \"Rock on, George, for Ringo one time!\" The Monkees referenced the latter remark leading into the instrumental break of their song \"No Time\" from their 1967 album Headquarters.\n\nThe Beatles performed the song twice for the BBC for the \"From Us To You\" and \"Top Gear\" programs. A version sung by Lennon is available on \"Live at the BBC\". and a version sung by Starr was released on \"On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2\".\n\nStarr performed a live version of the song, as a tribute to Harrison for their fondness of Perkins, at the Concert for George at London's Royal Albert Hall in 2002.\n\nAlong with \"Matchbox\", \"Honey Don't\" is one of the rare songs that all four Beatles have separately recorded or performed on stage (see section below).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2253277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253277", "title": "Every Little Thing (Beatles song)", "text": "Every Little Thing (Beatles song)\n\n\"Every Little Thing\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their album \"Beatles for Sale\", issued in the UK in December 1964. Credited to Lennon–McCartney, it was written by Paul McCartney, although John Lennon is the more prominent lead vocalist on the recording. Capitol Records first issued the song in the US on \"Beatles VI\" in June 1965. The track is an early example of the Beatles' use of non-rock instrumentation on a recording, through the addition of timpani drum over the choruses.\n\nRecalling the song's creation in his authorised biography, \"Many Years from Now\" (1997), McCartney says he wrote \"Every Little Thing\" in the music room at the London home of his then-girlfriend Jane Asher, where he was living at the time. Other sources, citing a 1964 interview with McCartney, place the song's origins at Atlantic City in the United States, where the Beatles stopped over in late August that same year during their US tour. In 1980, John Lennon told \"Playboy\" magazine that McCartney wrote the song, although he himself might have \"[thrown] something in\". Author John Winn concludes that McCartney began the composition in London and finished it with Lennon in Atlantic City.\n\n\"Every Little Thing\" is a rare example of a Lennon–McCartney song in which one member of the partnership was primary composer (here McCartney) but the other sang lead vocal (here Lennon). McCartney sings in unison with Lennon on the verses, but Lennon's vocal is more prominent. McCartney sings the high harmony on the chorus.\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"Every Little Thing\" for their fourth studio album, \"Beatles for Sale\", during a period when Lennon and McCartney's productivity as songwriters had suffered as a result of the band's international touring commitments. In \"Many Years from Now\", McCartney says he had intended the song to be their next single, but it \"didn't have quite what was required\", and was issued as an album track instead.\n\nThe group recorded the song in four takes at EMI Studios in London on 29 September 1964, and then five more on 30 September. The recording has been the source of some confusion among commentators,<ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"></ref> based on McCartney's comments in 1964 that the electric guitar riff was played by Lennon, rather than by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist. In their respective line-ups for the song, authors Ian MacDonald and Kenneth Womack each credit Harrison for the lead guitar part, played on a Rickenbacker 12-string, and Lennon as the acoustic rhythm guitarist. Winn also names Harrison as the lead guitarist, saying that he played Rickenbacker on the basic track and the subsequent overdubs.\n\nThe four band members enjoyed themselves on the second night; take 6 was aborted due to McCartney burping his vocals, and take 7 was finished but ended in loud laughter. \"Every Little Thing\" is one of the first Beatles tracks to include \"exotic\" instrumentation, as Ringo Starr added timpani over the choruses, punctuating the refrain with one-two flourishes. In addition, musicologist Walter Everett highlights the subtle use of piano in the musical arrangement; played as an electric guitar motif by Harrison on initial takes of the song, this part provides a countermelody during the verses. The timpani and piano (the latter played by McCartney) were overdubbed onto take 9, along with a guitar intro.\n\nIan MacDonald praised the \"emotional depth\" of \"Every Little Thing\" and cited this song among others as a counter-argument to the common perception of McCartney as an \"emotional lightweight\". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic also admires the song and its \"infectious chorus\".<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\"></ref> While considering the Lennon–McCartney compositions on \"Beatles for Sale\" to be relatively uninspired, author Mark Hertsgaard pairs \"Every Little Thing\" with \"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\" as tracks that demonstrate \"how the band, thanks largely to John and Paul's extraordinary singing, could make unremarkable material sound richer than it really was\". Tom Ewing of Pitchfork Media describes \"Every Little Thing\" as a \"splendid\" song that is \"given melodramatic thrust by Shangri-Las-style piano and bass drum\". While noting the Beatles' fatigue on the album in reaction to their punishing schedule in 1964, Ewing views McCartney's narrative as \"distinctly melancholy, his 'yes, I know I'm a lucky guy' sounding like an attempt to convince himself of that\".\n\nIn 2010, \"Every Little Thing\" appeared at number 91 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Beatles Songs\".\n\nThis song was revisited briefly during the stressful rehearsals that were recorded for the Beatles' \"Get Back/Let It Be\" project – Harrison describes it as \"a good one\" before starting to play the lick, McCartney joining in on vocals.\n\nGuesting on NPR's All Songs Considered, musician Matthew Caws selected \"Every Little Thing\" as his pick for \"perfect song\". Caws said: \"the lyrics are happy and simple, but the melody is sad and deceptively complex. The disconnect between these two elements is what gives the song such depth.\"\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald and Kenneth Womack:\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated in the southernmost part of Hamilton County within the valley of Lookout Mountain below the part of the Tennessee River known as Moccasin Bend. St Elmo is at the crossroads of two ancient Indian trails, and was first occupied by Native American hunters and gatherers in the Woodland period, then agricultural Mississippians, including Euchee and Muscogee, and for a brief period between 1776 and 1786, the Cherokees in a community called Lookout Town. St. Elmo became part of the city of Chattanooga when it was annexed in September 1929.\n\nHundreds of properties in the neighborhood were listed on the National Register in 1982, and in 1996 St. Elmo was designated a Local Historic District. Many of the buildings from the late 19th and early 20th century have been preserved. A St. Elmo resident is an 'Elmoian'.\n\nIn 1776, Cherokee chief Dragging Canoe and several hundred Cherokee warriors migrated to Chickamauga Creek after objecting to a treaty between other Cherokees and American land speculators and promising active resistance. They became known as the \"Chickamaugas\", and eventually moved farther down the Tennessee River below The Suck; to the other end of the Tennessee River Gorge. There they built the \"Five Lower Towns\" at Running Water (now Whiteside) and further downriver. Between 1777 and 1782, the so-called \"Chickamaugas\" also had a town called Tsatanugi (or Chatanuga, based on the Muscogee word \"cvto\" - rock), near here along Chattanooga Creek.\n\nDaniel Ross, a young Scottish immigrant, came to the area in 1785 and worked at a trading post with John McDonald, the area's first businessman. Ross married McDonald's daughter and the two built a house in what was to become St. Elmo after the Wars. Their youngest son, John Ross, was the leader of the Cherokee Nation who would call for passive resistance to the federal Indian removal policies that led to the Trail of Tears in 1838.\n\nUp until 1838, the Tennessee River was the dividing line between Hamilton County and the Cherokee country. That year, the community of Ross's Landing was surveyed, and in 1839 the village of Chattanooga was established north of the mouth of Chattanooga Creek. In 1840, the state of Tennessee began to sell the property formerly owned by the Cherokees at the rate of $7.50 an acre. Much of the Tennessee side of Lookout Mountain and the surrounding land was purchased by the Whiteside and Cravens families.\n\nThe area at the foot of Lookout Mountain was acquired shortly after the Civil War by Colonel Abraham Malone Johnson and his wife, Thankful Whiteside Johnson. In 1885, Colonel Johnson divided his farm into residential and commercial lots. The name \"St. Elmo\" was taken from the title of a novel written by Augusta J. Evans Wilson, who had spent several summers on Lookout Mountain and found the view similar to that of St. Elmo Castle in Naples, Italy. Her book, \"St. Elmo\", was published in 1866, and ultimately rivaled Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in impact and influence. \"St. Elmo \"became one of the top three best-selling novels of the nineteenth century.\n\nA yellow fever epidemic in Chattanooga caused an exodus in 1878. Almost 12,000 people fled the city, many going to Lookout Mountain. At the time, the mountain was accessible on the north side only by a four-hour trip up the old Whiteside Turnpike, which was built in the 1850s and cost a toll of two dollars. Complaints about the toll led to the 1879 construction of the St. Elmo Turnpike, which had an easier grade and a lower toll (the St. Elmo turnpike was paved and renamed the Adolph S. Ochs Highway in the late 1920s).\n\nUntil the 1880s, the area at the foot of Lookout Mountain remained primarily a wooded area. The real boom in the growth of St. Elmo as a residential community coincided with the planning and development of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, which was dedicated in 1890. At the time, St. Elmo saw development resulting from both a general real estate and construction boom in the South and the 1893 expansion of an electric trolley from Chattanooga to St. Elmo.\n\nThe trolley was not the only transportation development to influence the history of St. Elmo. In 1887, the narrow-gauge Incline #1 ran cars from St. Elmo up to the bluffs of Lookout Mountain. Soon after, a broad-gauge line was opened for carrying regular railroad cars to the mountaintop. And finally, in 1895, Incline #2 (now known as the Incline Railway) started taking passengers up the steepest part of the mountain. Its views were popular with both residents and tourists, and by 1900 the success of this railway closed down all of its competitors. Today, \"America's Most Amazing Mile\" still enjoys the distinction of being the world's steepest passenger railway.\n\nIn 1905, St. Elmo was incorporated and a town commission was formed for the purpose of securing funding for a school. A bond was issued, and work on the building was completed at the end of 1906. The small brick building replaced St. Elmo's first school, established in 1891.\n\nIt wasn't until 1926 that a direct route was established between St. Elmo and Chattanooga. The city wanted to provide a thoroughfare to St. Elmo and Lookout Mountain, but Broad Street ended abruptly at Ninth Street (now Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard), terminating at a railroad station owned by the State of Georgia. Negotiations to open a passageway for a road through the south side had failed over the years. Chattanooga Commissioner Ed Bass took matters into his own hands on the night of May 6, when he and a crew of city workers bulldozed enough of the buildings to establish a right-of-way for cars. The city got its road, and eventually Georgia sold the rest of its holdings in the area.\n\n"}

It was released on the album \"Beatles for Sale\" in the United Kingdom in December 1964. \"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\" was also released on the \"Beatles for Sale (No. 2)\" EP.\n\nIn the United States, Capitol released the song as the B-side of the single \"Eight Days a Week\", and later on the \"Beatles VI\" album, both in 1965. The song charted as a B-side, reaching number 39 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe lyrics anticipate themes that were to become familiar in Lennon's songwriting – alienation and inner pain. In this song, the narrator is at a party, waiting for his girl to show up. When it becomes clear that she has stood him up, he decides to leave, rather than spoil the party for everyone else. Both the lyrics and melody share a melancholy sound and theme with songs that precede it on \"Beatles for Sale\", such as \"No Reply\" and \"I'm a Loser\". Author Ian MacDonald views the song as a return to the subject matter introduced by Lennon on \"I'll Cry Instead\", from the Beatles' \"A Hard Day's Night\" album, and a \"preview\" of \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\", from \"Help!\"\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\" on 29 September 1964 in 19 takes, the last of which was released. George Harrison's guitar solo, played on his new Gretsch Tennessean in the style of Carl Perkins, was enhanced by midrange resonance boost, giving it an especially bright sound. According to \"The Encyclopedia of Country Music\", the song is an early example of country rock, anticipating the Byrds' work in that style. MacDonald describes it as the \"most overt\" country track on \"Beatles for Sale\", an album that is \"dominated by the idiom\".\n\nAmong the band's biographers, opinions differ on which Beatle sings the low harmony part during the verses, below Lennon's lead vocal. MacDonald lists Harrison as the second vocalist on the track, while John Winn credits McCartney, saying that he sounds \"deceptively like a second Lennon\". According to musicologist Walter Everett, the harmony part is Lennon \"self-duetting\".\n\nAccording to Walter Everett:\n\nRosanne Cash covered the song for her \"Hits 1979-1989\" compilation. Her version went to number one on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Country Songs chart in 1989. It was also Cash's last number one hit to date, and is the only Lennon-McCartney song to top the country chart.\n\n"}

They are precursors to oligodendrocytes and may also be able to differentiate into neurons and astrocytes.\n\nDifferentiated oligodendrocytes support axons and provide electrical insulation in the form of a myelin sheath, enabling faster action potential propagation and high fidelity transmission without a need for an increase in axonal diameter. \n\nThe loss or lack of OPCs, and consequent lack of differentiated oligodendrocytes, is associated with a loss of myelination and subsequent impairment of neurological functions.<ref name=\"doi 10.1002/glia.22406\"></ref>\n\nOligodendrocyte progenitor cells are a subtype of glial cells in the central nervous system, characterized by expression of the proteoglycans PDGFRA, and CSPG4. OPCs are smaller than neurons, of comparable size to other glia, and can either have a bipolar or complex multipolar morphology with processes reaching up to ~50 μm.\n\nOPCs encompass approximately 3-4% of cells in the grey matter and 8-9% in white matter, making them the fourth largest group of glia after astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes.\n\nOPCs are particularly prevalent in the hippocampus and in all layers of the neocortex. In white matter, OPCs are found along unmyelinated axons as well as along myelinated axons, engulfing nodes of Ranvier. Recently, OPCs have been shown to reside in close contact with NG2-expressing pericytes in cerebral white matter, as well.\n\nOPCs have a remarkable homogenic distribution throughout the brain. This is achieved through active self-repulsion, causing the cells to be generally equally spaced from one another. OPCs constantly survey their surroundings through actively extending and retracting processes that have been termed \"growth cone like processes\". Death or differentiation of an OPC is rapidly followed by migration or local proliferation of a neighbouring cell.\n\nOPCs receive synaptic contacts onto their processes from both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. OPCs receive preferred somatic contacts from fast-spiking GABAergic neurons, while non-fast spiking interneurons have a preference for contacting the processes. These inhibitory connections (in mice) occur mainly during a specific period in development, from postnatal day 8 till postnatal day 13.\n\nOPCs originate in the neuroepithelium of the spine and migrate to other areas of the brain. Several waves of OPC production and migration lead to the generation of oligodendrocytes. OPCs are highly proliferative, migratory and bipolar.<ref name=\"doi10.1016/0962-8924(93)90213-K\"></ref> The first wave of OPC production originates in the ganglionic eminence.\n\nAs development progresses a second and third wave of OPCs originate from the lateral and caudal ganglionic eminences and generate the majority of adult oligodendrocytes. OPCs then migrate across most of the developing brain and spinal cord and eventually myelinate the entire central nervous system (CNS). They differentiate into the less mobile, pro-oligodendrocytes that further differentiate into oligodendrocytes, a process characterized by the emergence of the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), or myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Following terminal differentiation \"in vivo\", mature oligodendrocytes wrap around and myelinate axons. \"In vitro\", oligodendrocytes create an extensive network of myelin-like sheets. The process of differentiation can be observed both through morphological changes and cell surface markers specific to the discrete stage of differentiation, though the signals for differentiation are unknown. The various waves of OPCs could myelinate distinct regions of the brain, which suggests that distinct functional subpopulations of OPCs perform different functions.\n\nOPCs are found in both white and gray matter. However, the number of OPCs is higher in white matter than in gray matter because of a higher rate of proliferation in the former. White matter OPCs proliferate and contribute to adult oligodendrogenesis, while gray matter OPCs are slowly proliferative or quiescent and mostly remain in an immature state. White and gray matter OPCs have different resting membrane potentials and ion channel expression. Gray matter lacks voltage-gated sodium channels while white matter does not and produces action potentials. Cells that produce action potentials can receive signals from other neurons. These differences in OPC function depend on their locations.\n\nThrough maturation, OPCs are produced in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ). The stem cells in the SVZ generate C cells which produce OPCs that go into the olfactory bulb. The number of oligodendrocytes that are later formed depends on the part of the SVZ they came from. More oligodendrocytes are produced from the dorsal part of the SVZ than the ventrolateral part, and more are produced from the posterior than the rostral part. This is due to differing environmental factors in these locations. The Wnt in the dorsal part favors OPC specification and the Bmp in the ventral part inhibits it. These molecules help cause the expression of certain transcription factors.\n\nExpression of Olig2 generates motor neurons and OPCs, dependent on the Shh and regulated by the Notch signaling pathway. This regulation limits the number of motor neurons and allows more oligodendrocytes to be produced. Olig2 is one of the most important transcription factors involved in oligodendrocyte production. Olig2 inactivation during development reduces OPC production.\n\nDifferentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes involves massive reorganization of cytoskeleton proteins ultimately resulting in increased cell branching and lamella extension, allowing oligodendrocytes to myelinate multiple axons. Laminin, a component of the extracellular matrix, plays an important role regulating oligodendrocyte production. Mice lacking laminin alpha2-subunit produced fewer OPCs in the SVZ. MicroRNA (miRNA) plays a role in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin maintenance. Deletion of Dicer1 in miRNA disrupts normal brain myelination. However, miR-7a, and miRNA in OPCs, promotes OPC production during brain development.\n\nMultiple pathways cause oligodendrocyte branching, but their specific contributions have yet to be resolved and the process by which oligodendrocytes extend and wrap around multiple axons remains poorly understood.\n\nOPCs were long held to function purely as progenitors to oligodendrocytes, hence the name. Later, additional functions were suggested.\n\nThe primary function is to serve as precursor for oligodendrocytes as well as some protoplasmic astrocytes in grey matter. Postnatally, OPCs remain lineage-restricted and generally only differentiate into oligodendrocytes.\n\nWhereas some studies suggested that OPCs can generate cortical neurons, other studies rejected these findings. The question is unresolved, as studies continue to find that certain populations of OPCs can form neurons.\n\nOPCs synthesize the neuromodulatory factors prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) and neuronal pentraxin 2 (Nptx2). This is mediated by the protein NG2, whose intracellular domain can be cleaved by the γ-secretase and translocated to the nucleus.\n\nThe two N-terminal LNS (laminin/neurexin/sex hormone-binding globulin-domain) domains of the NG2 ectodomain can modulate signalling via AMPA and NMDA receptors of neuronal synapses within the cortex, including neuronal LTP. The NG2 ectodomain is released into the ECM from the full-length NG2 protein by constitutive and activity-dependent activity of the ADAM10 protease (α-secretase activity), showing that NG2 can modulate the neuronal glutamatergic system.\n\nRecent work has also illustrated that OPCs can act as antigen presenting cells. They have been shown to express functional MHC II and initiate a learnt CD4+ immunological response. \n\nSpontaneous myelin repair was first observed in cat models.<ref name=\"doi 10.1083/jcb.10.1.67\"></ref> It was later discovered to occur in the human CNS as well, specifically in cases of multiple sclerosis (MS).<ref name=\"doi 10.1093/brain/88.5.937\"></ref> Spontaneous myelin repair does not result in morphologically normal oligodendrocytes and is associated with thinner myelin compared to axonal diameter than normal myelin.<ref name=\"doi 10.1038/249577a0\"></ref> Despite morphological abnormalities, however, remyelination does restore normal conduction.<ref name=\"doi 10.1016/0022-510X(82)90215-5\"></ref> In addition, spontaneous remyelination does not appear to be rare, at least in the case of MS. Studies of MS lesions reported the average extent of remyelination as high as 47%.<ref name=\"doi 10.1111/j.1750-3639.2006.00043.x\"></ref> Comparative studies of cortical lesions reported a greater proportion of remyelination in the cortex as opposed to white matter lesions.\n\nMature oligodendrocytes are unlikely to contribute to spontaneous remyelination even if they survive the original demyelinating injury. New oligodendrocytes have been observed in areas of myelin damage, although the source of these new cells is unresolved. One possibility is that mature oligodendrocytes from uninjured areas migrate to the injury site and engage in myelination. This is unlikely because the transplantation of mature human oligodendrocytes achieve minimal myelin formation in the demyelinated rodent CNS. Another possibility is that mature oligodendrocytes de-differentiate into OPCs that then proliferate and remyelinate, Little experimental evidence supports this view.\n\nSome evidence suggests that the source of these new oligodendrocytes is proliferative adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Such cells have been demonstrated to exist in the adult rodent<ref name=\"doi10.1038/319499a0\"></ref> and human CNS. These oligodendrocyte precursor cells appear to play a major role in remyelination and are, unlike mature oligodendrocytes, able to cause extensive remyelination after transplantation into areas of myelin damage. The role of these cells absent local demyelination, however, is under investigation. The fact that oligodendrocyte progenitors exhibit electrophysiological properties related to the expression of a range of glutamate receptors allowing communication with the neuron-axon unit suggests that OPCs are likely to have additional functions.<ref name=\"doi 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.04.158\"></ref>\n\nThe observation of OPCs in MS lesions that have not remyelinated suggested the hypothesis that the differentiation of these progenitors has been inhibited. One proposed mechanism involves the accumulation of myelin debris at the axon, suggesting that the inflammatory environment may be conducive to remyelination, as does the release of growth factors by inflammatory cells and activated microglia. Alternatively, the accumulation of glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan at the lesion site may inhibit OPC differentiation. The release of OPC-specific antibodies by chronically demyelinated axons have been implicated as a remyelination inhibitor. Other proposed mechanisms posit that OPC migration is inhibited by either molecules expressed by chronically demyelinated axons or the accumulation of unreactive astrocytes in MS lesions.\n\nOPC transplants contribute to remyelination, but it is difficult to maintain such cells in adequate concentrations at high purity. Finding a source for these cells remains impractical as of 2016. Should adult cells be used for transplantation, a brain biopsy would be required for each patient, adding to the risk of immune rejection. Embryonically derived stem cells have been demonstrated to carry out remyelination under laboratory conditions, but some religious groups are opposed to their use. Adult central nervous system stem cells have also been shown to generate myelinating oligodendrocytes, but are not readily accessible.\n\nEven if a viable source of OPCs were found, identifying and monitoring the outcome of remyelination remains difficult, though multimodal measures of conduction velocity and emerging magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer improved sensitivity versus other imaging methods.<ref name=\"doi 10.1038/nn1075\"></ref> In addition, the interaction between transplanted cells and immune cells and the effect of inflammatory immune cells on remyelination have yet to be fully characterized. If the failure of endogenous remyelination is due to an unfavorable differentiation environment, then this will have to be addressed prior to transplantation.\n\n"}

It was written by Paul McCartney, although credited to Lennon–McCartney. The song was one of eight original compositions on \"Beatles for Sale\". In North America, where Capitol Records typically altered the content of the band's albums, \"What You're Doing\" instead appeared on the 1965 US release \"Beatles VI\".\n\n\"What You're Doing\" was written by McCartney in Atlantic City on 30 August 1964, shortly following the end of the Beatles' 1964 world tour. Throughout the song, McCartney adds to the rhyme scheme by combining a single, two-syllable word with two one-syllable words (i.e. \"Look what you're \"doing\", I'm feeling \"blue and\" lonely... You got me \"runnin\"', and there's no \"fun in\" it\"). He used the same technique on \"She's a Woman\", which was also recorded during the \"Beatles for Sale\" sessions.\n\nThe track features a guitar riff played by George Harrison on his Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar. The sound was influential on the Byrds, who crafted their sound partly on the Beatles' use of the Rickenbacker, and Harrison in turn adopted influences from the Byrds in his 1965 song \"If I Needed Someone\".<ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"></ref>\n\nThe Beatles attempted to record the song on 29 September 1964, but only the basic rhythm track was taped over seven takes (with take seven being deemed the best). A day later, after finishing the recording of \"Every Little Thing\", the group recorded five more takes, with take 11 being deemed the \"best;\" Lewisohn notes that at this point, the song differed from the final version in that \"its breaks between choruses were less tight, the middle eight instrumental break was performed an octave above the vocals and it had a 1 & 1/2 second pause preceding a reprise instrumental coda.\" The group remade the song into its final form on 26 October, immediately after completing work on the Carl Perkins-cover \"Honey Don't\". It was the last song to be completed for \"Beatles for Sale\".\n\nThe song was sampled to create a medley, along with \"Drive My Car\" and \"The Word\", on the band's 2006 remix album \"Love\". \"What You're Doing\" shares a number of characteristics with (the also predominantly McCartney-written) \"Drive My Car\", particularly the home key (D major), meter (4/4), and chord progression (alternating between B minor and G major).\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\n\n"}

Based on a 1934 song written by singer/songwriter Rex Griffin, it achieved widespread popularity when it was released in 1957 by Carl Perkins and covered by the Beatles in 1964.\n\nIt borrows from a song with the same title, chorus and verses written in the mid-1930s by Alabama-born country songwriter Rex Griffin. Griffin recorded the song for Decca Records in 1936 under the title \"Everybody's Tryin' To Be My Baby\". Roy Newman and His Boys recorded a song with the same title in 1938. Perkins recorded his song with the same title with similar music but an updated arrangement in 1956 for Sun Records. The Perkins song was featured on the 1957 Sun LP \"Dance Album of Carl Perkins\", which was also released in the UK on London. The album was later re-released as \"Teen Beat: The Best of Carl Perkins\". Perkins' recording was subsequently covered by the Beatles in 1964. The Beatles' recording, the best-known version of the song, is attributed to Carl Perkins. Lyrically, the Perkins and Griffin songs are similar, but musically, the arrangement is more modern. The melody, later used in Rock Around the Clock, was also borrowed by Hank Williams for Move It On Over and Mind Your Own Business. The Carl Perkins song is more blues-based and closer to \"Blue Suede Shoes\" in style.\n\nThe recording was re-released on the 1961 Sun Records album \"Teen Beat: The Best of Carl Perkins\", \"Carl Perkins' Original Golden Hits\" by Sun International in 1969, \"Original Sun Greatest Hits\" by Rhino Records in 1986, \"Blues Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session\", and on a Rhino Records CD EP \"Lil' Bit of Gold\" in 1988.\n\nAfter 1964, the Carl Perkins song became well known in the version recorded by the Beatles. The Beatles recorded \"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\" on 18 October 1964 at EMI Studios, London, with George Harrison (a lifelong fan of Perkins) on vocals. Harrison's vocals were heavily processed with the STEED effect. It was first released as the final track on \"Beatles for Sale\" in the United Kingdom later that year, and likewise as the concluding track on the North American album \"Beatles '65\".\n\nThe Beatles' recording finishes with a false ending, with the final phrase repeating itself after the song seems to have stopped. A version recorded live at the Star-Club in Hamburg in December 1962 contained four of these musical phrases.\n\nLive performances of the Beatles' \"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\" were recorded in June 1963 for the BBC radio program \"Pop Go The Beatles\", and in November 1964 for \"Saturday Club\". The latter recording can be heard on \"Live at the BBC\".\n\nThe Beatles continued to perform the song after their studio recording was released. The song was performed in Paris, France in 1965. The performance recorded at Shea Stadium on 15 August 1965 was included on \"Anthology 2\".\n\nIn 1976, Capitol released the song on the compilation album \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\".\n\nGeorge Harrison performed the song with Carl Perkins on the Cinemax cable special \"\" in 1985. Bruce Springsteen performed the song live in concert in 1998 as a tribute to Carl Perkins on news of his death. Johnny Cash’s mid-90s version of the song backed by Carl Perkins and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers was included on his 2003 concept-compilation album \"Unearthed'. \n\nIn 2016, the song was featured as a bonus track on the remastered \"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\" album in a live performance from August 30, 1965 in conjunction with the release of the Ron Howard concert film \"\".\n\n"}

Owned by Bowling Green State University, it is sister to radio station WBGU (88.1 FM). The two stations share studios at the Tucker Center for Telecommunications on the BGSU campus; WBGU-TV's transmitter is located near Belmore, Ohio. (While officially part of the BGSU campus, the Tucker Center is actually located two blocks south of Wooster Street, which marks much of the southern boundary of the campus.) Unlike the radio station, WBGU-TV is not primarily operated by students at the university; however, the station does offer many different student positions that allow students to gain experience.\n\nOn February 10, 1964, WBGU-TV (originally licensed to Lima but operating in Bowling Green) broadcast for the first time, and, unusually for a U.S. television station, would undergo two frequency changes in its first quarter century. The station first operated on channel 70, and moved to channel 57 in 1973 (it was the last full-power station to broadcast on a channel 70 or above in the United States); it would move to channel 27 in 1986. WBGU originally wanted to move to channel 27 in the early 1970s, but protests from the nearby WGTE-TV in Toledo, which operated on the adjacent channel 30 at the time and, because of significant territorial overlap, feared confusion between the two channels, prompted state and University officials to settle for the higher channel number.\n\nThe station first broadcast from a small studio located in the university's South Hall. After the Moore Musical Arts Center was built in 1979, the university's radio stations and telecommunications department (then the department of radio, television, and film) moved to West Hall, which formerly housed the university's college of music. Sometime after that, WBGU-TV moved to a new building located at 245 Troup Avenue in Bowling Green; the building was renamed the Tucker Center on May 6, 1994.\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, WBGU maintained a low-powered repeater in Fort Wayne, Indiana on channel 39, W39AA (later to affiliate with Indianapolis' WFYI), which became full-powered WFWA in 1985.\nToday, WBGU-TV broadcasts to nineteen counties in northwestern and west central Ohio including the markets of Toledo and Lima. With most attic antennas, WBGU's signal can be tuned in as far west as Fort Wayne and as far north as central Lenawee County, Michigan. During tropospheric conditions, it can be seen as far north as Melvindale, Michigan, away with a very advanced indoor antenna.\nIn Toledo, Buckeye Broadband carries WBGU-TV on cable channel 57, which is, ironically, the station's previous channel number on the UHF dial. No subchannels are available on Buckeye Broadband.\n\nWBGU turned off its analog transmitter at midnight on December 14, 2008, and relocated its digital signal from channel 56 to channel 27.\n\nIn 2019, WBGU-TV won an regional Emmy Award for a training video produced in conjunction with campus police to help counter active shooter threats.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWBGU-TV had considering selling off its UHF frequency as part of the digital spectrum auction, for mobile bandwidth use, but pulled out late in the auction bidding process. The station remained on the air, but relocated to UHF 22 from UHF 27 on December 4, 2018.\n\nNational programming produced by WBGU includes \"The American Woodshop\", distributed by the National Educational Telecommunications Association.\n\nEach weekday during the academic term of public schools in the Great Black Swamp region, WBGU-TV broadcasts six hours of educational programming provided (and, in some cases, produced) by the Northwest Ohio Educational Technology Foundation. The NWOET is operated at the Tucker Center, but is a non-profit state agency separate from the university.\n\n"}

Sen's grandfather, Dinesh Chandra Sen, was a well-known writer and member of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad. His father, Arun Sen, an academic, noted, \"I am the son of an illustrious father and the father of an illustrious son!\" Samar Sen, along with Subhash Mukhopadhyay, belonged to the second generation of modern Bengali poets. He gave up poetry fairly early, however, and devoted the better part of his later life to Marxist politics and journalism. He was the editor of the leftist newspaper \"Frontier\", published from Kolkata, which was banned during the period of the Indian Emergency (1975 -1977) declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\n\nSamar Sen, like his poetic contemporaries, grew up under the gigantic impact of Rabindranath Tagore. Yet Sen was perhaps the first to 'break' with the lyrical romanticism of Tagore and introduce \"modern\" concerns (disenchantment, decadence, avant-garde urban perspectives) into Bengali verse. Through his work, the influence of French and English modernism was first translated into Bengali verse; at the same time, the convergence of modernism and Marxism was evident early on in his poetic thought and style. His poetry was somewhat over-shadowed by his very original journalism, produced while he served as editor of the legendary \"Frontier\". He was also known for his translations of Soviet literature; he spent nearly five years in Moscow working as a translator, although later in life he became doubtful about bureaucratic Communism. \nSamar Sen also edited the radical journal \"Now\", publishing a galaxy of prominent scholars and writers, including Joan Robinson and Satyajit Ray; his deputy editor was the playwright and actor Utpal Dutt. In his private life Sen was a man with a wry sense of humour, sometimes acerbic but often lethally accurate. He never regretted the sacrifice of what could have been a comfortable material life, supported by conventional measures of bourgeois success. His loyalty was always to the downtrodden. Some critics mourn his abandonment of poetry as a loss to Indian literature, reasoning that his acute perception and extraordinary command of languages would have continued to produce memorable verse of lasting significance. Sen decided, however, that poetry was a luxury in a world of gross deprivation and injustice and decided he would instead dedicate himself to agitating on behalf of the poor, regardless of the cost to himself. He remained committed to this cause for the rest of his life, despite experiencing significant poverty himself.\n\n\n\nSamar Sen was founder-editor of the weekly magazine \"Frontier\", first published in 1968.\n\n"}

His father, also named Marcus Samuel, ran a successful import-export business, M. Samuel & Co., trading with the coalition in the Far East, which Marcus carried on with his brother, Samuel Samuel. The Samuel & Co companies launched the first Japanese gold sterling loan issued in London, and was largely concerned in the introduction of Japanese municipal loans, and in the development of the coal trade in Japan.\n\nHe was educated at Edmonton and in Brussels, and travelled extensively in Asia before settling down in business, visiting Ceylon, Straits Settlements, Siam, the Philippines, China and Japan. Samuel realised the potential of the oil trade during a trip to [Baku], near the Caspian Sea in 1890, and ordered the construction of eight dedicated tankers, the first of which was \"Murex\", which was under the command of Captain John R Coundon. His were the first such ships to satisfy the Suez Canal company of their safety, allowing him to ship his product to Bangkok and Singapore. In 1897 he formed Shell, after his first business, which sold painted seashells. He was knighted in 1898 for assisting in the salvage of HMS \"Victorious\", which had grounded under questionable circumstances and was pulled to safety by the Shell tanker \"SS Pecten\".\n\nMarcus was Master of the Spectacle Makers' Company and of the Gardeners' Company, and a Director of the Alliance Marine Assurance Company.\n\nIn 1907, Samuel's company combined with a \"Dutch\" company of the Netherlands to create the company today known as Royal Dutch Shell. M. Samuel & Co., having transformed over the years to a merchant bank, merged in 1965 with Philip Hill, Higginson, Erlangers Ltd to create Hill Samuel, which is now a part of Lloyds TSB.\n\nSamuel had a long career in the civic government of the City of London. He was elected an Alderman of the London ward of Portsoken in 1891, and elected Sheriff of the City of London in 1894 (serving October 1894 to September 1895). While Sheriff, he took a leading part in the scheme for the unification of London by the absorption of the City and the metropolitan districts into the London County Council (which had been created in 1889). In late September 1902 he was elected Lord Mayor of London for the coming year (serving from November 1902 to November 1903), and received the traditional Baronetcy in 1903. He was on the Commission for the Lieutenancy for City of London, a visiting justice of Holloway and Newgate prisons, and chairman of a City committee in connection with the Royal Commission on the Port of London (1900–02). He was also for three years a member of the Thames Conservancy board as the elected representative of the shipowners, and was a Justice of the peace for Kent.\n\nIn recognition of his contribution to the British cause in World War I, he was created 1st Baron Bearsted of Maidstone in the County of Kent in the 1921 Birthday Honours. In the 1925 Birthday Honours, he was elevated to 1st Viscount Bearsted. Lord Bearsted was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Law (LLD) from the University of Sheffield during his lifetime.\n\nSamuel married in 1881 Fanny Elizabeth Benjamin, a daughter of Benjamin Benjamin, of Stranraer House, London.\nHis son, Walter Horace Samuel, succeeded him both in his titles and as Chairman of the Shell Transport and Trading Company.\n\nHis country estate at The Mote in Maidstone was sold after his death to Maidstone Borough Council for use as a public park now known as Mote Park. The house has since been used as an orphanage and a nursing home and was commandeered by the British Army during the Second World War. It is now being converted into retirement housing.\n\n\n\n"}

She was launched 7 January 1939 by Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania; sponsored by Mrs. William D. Leahy; and commissioned 20 March 1939 with Lieutenant Commander William W. Behrens, Sr. in command.\n\n\"Cimarron\" cleared Houston 31 May 1939 for Pearl Harbor, arriving 21 July. She transported oil between west coast ports and Pearl Harbor, making 13 such voyages until she sailed for the east coast on 19 August 1940. After repairs and alterations, she began oil runs on the east coast, principally between Baton Rouge and Norfolk, until August 1941, when she took part in amphibious operations. From 5–16 September she put to sea with a transport convoy bound for Iceland, and voyaged north again from 12 October to 5 November to refuel ships at Placentia Bay. On 15 November 1941, she joined a convoy at Trinidad bound for Singapore with reinforcements, but was detached from the convoy on 9 December at Cape Town, South Africa. Returning to Trinidad on 31 December, she operated from Brazilian ports to Iceland until 4 March 1942, when she cleared Norfolk for San Francisco.\n\n\"Cimarron\" reached San Francisco on 1 April 1942 and sailed the next day with the task force bound for the first air raid on Tokyo on 18 April. With , they fueled the Fleet at sea before and after the raid, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 April. She sailed on 29 April, bound to join the force soon to join battle with the Japanese naval forces in the Coral Sea, but arrived after the battle to refuel destroyers at Nouméa, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 May. She cleared Pearl Harbor 28 May to fuel the force which defeated the Japanese in the Battle of Midway and returned 12 June, departing 7 July to support the operation in the Solomon Islands. Using Nouméa as her principal base, \"Cimarron\" occasionally reloaded at Suva and Efate. After repairs at San Francisco in November 1942, she sailed for the forward area 18 December. She operated again out of Nouméa supporting the final stages of the Guadalcanal action, then fueled out of Efate, carried cargo to Sydney, Australia, and returned to fueling at Dumbea Bay in support of the occupation of New Georgia. She returned to San Francisco, in July 1943, and then made two trips from the west coast to Pearl Harbor.\n\n\"Cimarron\" departed Pearl Harbor 29 September 1943 with the force which raided Wake Island on 5–6 October, and returned to Pearl Harbor 16 October. She sailed once again 14 November to fuel in support of the Gilbert Islands campaign, returning 1 December, and sailed to San Pedro, California to reload 12 December to 4 January 1944. Clearing Pearl Harbor 13 January 1944, she supported the Marshall Islands operation and the February attacks on Truk from Majuro until 6 June; the Marianas operation from Eniwetok until 26 August; and the Palau Islands operation from Ulithi.\n\nAfter a stateside overhaul from October through December 1944, \"Cimarron\" arrived at Ulithi 26 December 1944. From 27 December to 21 January 1945 she sailed to fuel the task force launching air attacks on Indo-China and Philippine targets as part of the Luzon invasion, and put to sea again from 8 February to 22 March for air raids on the Japanese home islands and the invasion of Iwo Jima. From 26 March to 23 May she sailed from Ulithi to fuel ships engaging in the Okinawa operation, and from 3 June shuttled between Ulithi and the areas from which the mighty carrier task forces launched the final series of raids upon the heartland of Japan. Ulithi remained her base as she supported the occupation until 10 September, when she anchored in Tokyo Bay. Operations in the Far East continued until 4 February 1946, when she arrived at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, for overhaul.\n\nBetween July 1946 and June 1950, \"Cimarron\" ferried oil from the Persian Gulf to naval bases in the Marianas and Marshalls, occasionally continuing on to the US West Coast. Her first tour of duty in the Korean war, from 6 July 1950 to 3 June 1951, found her fueling ships of the Taiwan Patrol at Okinawa, amphibious ships at Kobe, and operating from Sasebo to the waters off Korea to fuel task forces. Several times she entered the heavily mined waters of Wonsan Harbor South Korea to fuel the ships carrying out the lengthy blockade and bombardment of that key port.\n\nReturning to the west coast, she gave service as a training tanker until her second Korean tour, from 1 August to 10 December 1951. During this time she spent a month at Taiwan fueling the ships on duty in the Formosa Straits, and made three voyages to Korean waters from Sasebo. During 1952, overhaul and training on the west coast preceded her third Korean war deployment from 9 April to 5 January 1953, when her duty was similar to that of her second. Her fourth tour of duty in the Far East was completed between 11 April and 27 November 1953.\n\n\"Cimarron\" sailed to the Far East again between 14 June 1954 and 8 February 1955, during which she served as flagship of the United Nations support group for Operation Passage to Freedom, the evacuation of refugees from Communist North Vietnam. Her pattern of operations from that time into 1963 included highly effective support of the guardian U.S. 7th Fleet in its Far Eastern operations through deployments in 1955, 1956-1957, 1957-1958, 1958-1959, 1959, and 1960. As of 1963, she had the longest continuous commissioned service of any active ship in the United States Navy, belying her age as she continued to provide her essential support with outstanding skill and efficiency.\n\n\"Cimarron\" continued her service into the Vietnam War between 1965 and 1967 and received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and Vietnam Service Medal for its participation in the Vietnam Advisory Campaign, Vietnam Defense, and Vietnamese Counteroffensive Phases I through III. In 1968, she was the oldest US Navy ship in continuous active service. \"Cimarron\" was decommissioned and struck from the Navy List in October 1968 and sold for scrap in 1969.\n\nThe bell from the ship was installed at Cimarron High School in Cimarron, New Mexico, where it was donated because of its proximity to Cimarron River Basin's headwaters and in recognition of this ship's dedicated crew members.\n\n\"Cimarron\" received 10 battle stars for World War II service, 7 for the Korean War, and 4 campaign stars for her Vietnam War service.\n\n\n"}

They may be a master of integration, as such an individual who knows enough from many learned trades and skills to be able to bring the individual's disciplines together in a practical manner. This person is a generalist rather than a specialist.\n\nIn Elizabethan English the quasi-New Latin term Johannes factotum (\"Johnny do-it-all\") was sometimes used, with the same negative connotation that \"Jack of all trades\" sometimes has today. The term was famously used by Robert Greene in his 1592 booklet \"Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit,\" in which he dismissively refers to actor-turned-playwright William Shakespeare with this term, the first published mention of the writer.\n\nIn 1612, the English-language version of the phrase appeared in the book \"Essays and Characters of a Prison\" by English writer Geffray Mynshul (Minshull), originally published in 1618, and probably based on the author's experience while held at Gray's Inn, London, when imprisoned for debt.\n\nThe \"master of none\" element appears to have been added later; it made the statement less flattering to the person receiving. Today, the phrase used in its entirety generally describes a person whose knowledge, while covering a number of areas, is superficial in all of them. When abbreviated as simply \"jack of all trades\", it is an ambiguous statement; the user's intention is then dependent on context. However, when \"master of none\" is added this is unflattering and sometimes added in jest. In the United States and Canada, the phrase has been in use since 1721.\n\nAn additional element is also sometimes used: \"Jack of all trades, master of none, oftentimes better than master of one\". This version implies that a person is a generalist rather than a specialist, versatile and adept at many things, and attempted to enforce versatility rather speciality as more useful.\n\n"}

The band formed in 1985 and broke up in 1992, formed again in 2016, and broke up the same year, later reforming in 2017.\n\n\nLorre and Bobby Belltower formed the band in New Jersey in the mid 1980s. The band moved to Los Angeles to pursue their musical careers, and after two members returned to New Jersey, Lorre and Siegel recruited guitarist Sam Merrick, drummer Alex Kirst and bass player Cliff D. (Cliff Jones).\n\nThe band was hoping to sign with an alternative label such as Alternative Tentacles, but their reputation led to interest from the major labels. However, the band's wild behavior led to some companies losing interest.\n\nThe Nymphs made an appearance in the 1990 film \"Bad Influence\" as a band playing in a club.\n\nIggy Pop sang vocals on the track \"Supersonic\" from the debut album.\n\nThings came to a head when Inger Lorre performed fellatio on her then-boyfriend, Rodney Eastman, on stage during their set at the Marquis club in Anaheim, California in 1992.

The \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" segment was developed first and was intended to be a standalone release, but publisher Fox Interactive insisted that the game should be more closely linked to the films, leading Probe to develop the other two segments. Initially the \"Die Hard 2\" segment of the game was developed with polygonal enemies, but they were later replaced with digitized sprites. For the \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" segment, the team had wanted to use an authentic recreation of New York City, but found that when driving at 200 miles per hour, an accurate model of NYC felt too small and confining.\n\nThe PlayStation was chosen as the lead platform because lead programmer Simon Pick strongly felt that it was the most powerful format of the time. In particular, he reasoned that the Saturn and PC versions would come out better if the programmers were trying to emulate impressive graphical effects on an extant PlayStation version than if they were designing the game around the hardware limitations of the Saturn. Pick elaborated on how the team intended to optimize the game for Saturn: \n\n\"Die Hard Trilogy\" was a commercial hit, with sales above 2 million units by March 2000.\n\nThe PlayStation version was positively reviewed. As of June 2017, it holds an 86% ranking at GameRankings. Most critics considered the high value-for-money of getting three games in one to be \"Die Hard Trilogy\"s strongest point. A few even stated that none of the three component games were good enough to stand on their own, but the variety offered by the collection as a whole makes it exceptionally entertaining. However, the majority commented that all three component games are outstanding even on their own terms. \"GamePro\"s Scary Larry presented a dissenting opinion; while he highly praised the game's addictive quality and sound effects, he argued that the three segments are ultimately just rehashes of (respectively) \"Resident Evil\", \"Virtua Cop\", and \"Twisted Metal\". The most common criticism was that the Die Harder segment requires the Konami light gun to be enjoyable, since the cursor when using the standard controller is slow and difficult to move. The first segment of the game was particularly praised for its deep challenge, requiring players to out-think the enemy.\n\n\"Die Hard Trilogy\" was a finalist for the Computer Game Developers Conference's 1996 \"Best Adaptation of Linear Media\" Spotlight Award, but lost the prize to \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\". However, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" editors named it Action Game of the Year.\n\nThe Saturn port also received mostly positive reviews, though it was often compared unfavorably to the PlayStation original. \"GamePro\"s The Rookie said the graphics are not as sharp as the PlayStation version's, especially in the \"Die Harder\" segment, but the gameplay is addictive enough to make this relatively unimportant. Josh Smith stated in \"GameSpot\" that the sluggish controls and poor graphics, especially as compared to the PlayStation version, make the first two segments of the game nearly unplayable, since lining up shots in time is awkward and frustrating. However, he said that in the third segment the animation is actually better than the PlayStation version's, and that the fast pace and black humor of this segment make it worth buying \"Die Hard Trilogy\" all by itself. Paul Glancey of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" summarized, \"Often when you see compilations like this there's ... one section that stands out as the one that the programmers thought of first and lavished the most attention on, but all three sections of \"Die Hard Trilogy\" have their fair share of thrills, great visuals and clever ideas.\"\n\nIn Germany, the game was banned because of its extreme violence, especially being able to drive through harmless people with blood spilling all over the windshield.\n"}
{"id": "2253390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253390", "title": "The Descent", "text": "The Descent\n\nThe Descent is a 2005 British adventure horror thriller movie written and directed by Neil Marshall. The film follows six women who, having entered a cave system, struggle to survive against the humanoid creatures inside.\n\nFilming took place in the United Kingdom. Exterior scenes were filmed at Ashridge Park, Hertfordshire, and in Scotland. Because the filmmakers considered it too dangerous and time-consuming to shoot in an actual cave, interior scenes were filmed on sets built at Pinewood Studios near London designed by Simon Bowles.\n\n\"The Descent\" opened in cinemas in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2005. It premiered in the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and released on 4 August 2006 in the United States. The film received positive reviews and was a box-office success, grossing $57.1 million against a £3.5 million budget.\n\nA sequel, titled \"The Descent Part 2\", directed by the first film's editor Jon Harris, was released in 2009.\n\nOn their way back from whitewater rafting with her friends Juno and Beth; Sarah, along with her husband Paul and their daughter Jessica, is involved in a car accident when Paul is distracted. Paul and Jessica are killed, but Sarah survives.\n\nOne year later, Sarah, Juno, and Beth, as well as friends Sam, Rebecca, and newcomer Holly are reunited at a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina for a spelunking adventure. The next day, they hike up to a cave entrance and descend. While in the cave, Juno apologizes to Sarah for not being there for her after the accident, but Sarah is distant. After the group moves through a narrow passage, it collapses behind them, trapping them. After a heated discussion, Juno admits that she has led the group into an unknown cave system instead of the fully explored cave system that they had originally planned to visit, and that rescue is, therefore, impossible. She then tells Sarah that she led them into the unknown cave in the hopes of restoring their relationship, but Sarah rebuffs her.\n\nAs the group presses forward with hopes of finding an exit, they discover climbing equipment from a previous caver and a cave painting that suggests an exit exists. Holly, thinking she sees sunlight, runs ahead, but falls down a hole and breaks her leg. As the others help Holly, Sarah wanders off and observes a pale, humanoid creature drinking at a pool before it scampers away. Later, the group comes across a den of animal bones and is suddenly attacked by a creature known as a \"crawler.\" Holly is killed when a crawler attacks and bites through her throat. Afraid, Sarah runs and falls down a hole, where she is knocked unconscious. Juno, trying to prevent Holly's body from being dragged away, kills a crawler with her pickaxe but then, startled and in shock, accidentally strikes Beth through the neck. Beth collapses with Juno's pendant in her hand and begs Juno not to leave her, but a traumatized Juno flees.\n\nSarah awakens to find herself in a den of human and animal carcasses, witnessing Holly's body being mauled and eaten by a group of crawlers. Juno discovers cave markings that point to a specific path through the caves, leading to an exit. After realizing the crawlers rely on sound to hunt, Juno regroups with Sam and Rebecca. Juno tells them about the markings she discovered, but she will not leave without Sarah. \n\nMeanwhile, Sarah encounters Beth, who tells her that Juno wounded then abandoned her. Beth gives her Juno's pendant, which Sarah recognizes as a gift from Paul, and realizes that Juno had an affair with Paul before his death. Near-death and in pain, and not wanting to be eaten by the crawlers, Beth begs Sarah to euthanize her, which Sarah reluctantly does by bashing her head repeatedly with a rock. Sarah then encounters a family of crawlers and manages to kill them all, falling into a blood-filled pond in the process and emerging covered in blood. Soon after, she has a psychotic breakdown.\n\nElsewhere, Juno, Sam and Rebecca are pursued by a large group of crawlers. The group reaches a chasm and Sam tries to climb across, but she encounters a crawler scaling the ceiling. The crawler attacks and rips her throat out, but Sam stabs it before bleeding to death in front of Juno and Rebecca. Rebecca is then dragged away and eaten alive as Juno escapes. Juno encounters Sarah and lies to her about seeing Beth die. After defeating a group of crawlers, Sarah confronts Juno, revealing she knows that Juno wounded Beth and left her for dead, and about her affair with Paul. Sarah then strikes Juno in the leg with a pickaxe and leaves her to die as a rabid swarm of crawlers approaches. Juno is last heard screaming as Sarah escapes.\n\nUS ending:\n\nSarah falls down a hole and is knocked unconscious. She awakens, clambers up a slope covered in bones, and escapes the cave. After pausing to recover her strength, Sarah runs to her vehicle and speeds off. She pulls over to the side of the road and breaks down in tears. After a truck passes her, she opens the window, leans out, and vomits. Upon re-entering the car, she sees a hallucination of Juno sitting next to her and screams.\n\nUK ending only:\n\nSarah then wakes up in the cave. She then sees a vision of Jessica's birthday cake and Jessica sitting across from her. The cake's fire is shown to actually be her torch. The camera slowly backs out as the crawlers are heard closing in on Sarah, revealing that she dreamt of her escape and that she is still trapped in the cave.\n\nWhen Neil Marshall's film \"Dog Soldiers\" (2002) was a moderate success, the director received numerous requests to direct other horror films. The director was initially wary of being typecast as a horror film director, although he eventually agreed to make \"The Descent\", emphasizing, \"They are very different films.\" Marshall decided to cast only women in the main roles, going against the original plan for a mixed cast.\n\nFilmmakers originally planned for the cast to be both male and female, but Neil Marshall's business partner realized that horror films rarely have all-female casts. Defying convention, Marshall cast all women, and to avoid making them clichéd, he solicited basic advice from his female friends. He explained the difference, \"The women discuss how they feel about the situation, which the soldiers in \"Dog Soldiers\" would never have done.\" He also gave the characters different accents to enable the audience to tell them apart and to establish a more \"cosmopolitan feel\" than the British marketing of \"Dog Soldiers\".\n\nThe cast included Shauna Macdonald as Sarah, Natalie Mendoza as Juno, Alex Reid as Beth, Saskia Mulder as Rebecca, MyAnna Buring as Sam, Nora-Jane Noone as Holly, Oliver Milburn as Paul, and Molly Kayll as Jessica. Craig Conway portrayed one of the film's crawlers, Scar.\n\nWhile \"The Descent\" is set in North America, the film was shot entirely in the United Kingdom. Exterior scenes were filmed in Scotland, and interior scenes were filmed in sets built at Pinewood Studios, near London. The cave was built at Pinewood because filmmakers considered it too dangerous and time-consuming to shoot in an actual cave. Set pieces were reused with care, and filmmakers sought to limit lighting to the sources the characters bring with them into the cave, such as helmet lights.\n\nMarshall cited the films \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\", \"The Thing\", and \"Deliverance\" as influences in establishing tension in \"The Descent\". The director elaborated, \"We really wanted to ramp up the tension slowly, unlike all the American horror films you see now. They take it up to 11 in the first few minutes and then simply can't keep it up. We wanted to show all these terrible things in the cave: dark, drowning, claustrophobia. Then, when it couldn't get any worse, make it worse.\" Marshall also said at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival that he was inspired by Italian horror films of the past, in particular, those by Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci.\n\nSimon Bowles designed the maze of caves for \"The Descent\". Reviews credited Bowles: e.g., \"Bowles' beautifully designed cave sets conjure a world of subterranean darkness.\"\nThe film had twenty-one cave sets, built by Rod Vass and his company Armordillo Ltd. using a unique system of polyurethane sprayed rock that was developed for this production.\n\nProduction of \"The Descent\" competed with a big-budget American film that had a similar premise, \"The Cave\". \"The Descent\" was originally scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom by November 2005 or February 2006, but \"The Cave\" began filming six months before its competitor. The filmmakers of \"The Descent\" decided to release their film before \"The Cave\", so they fast-tracked production to be completed by the end of February 2005.\n\n\"The Descent\" was released in North America with approximately one minute cut from the end. In the American cut, Sarah escapes from the cave and sees Juno, but the film does not cut back to the cave. The August 4, 2006 issue of \"Entertainment Weekly\" reported that the ending was trimmed because American viewers did not like its \"uber-hopeless finale\". Lionsgate marketing chief Tim Palen said, \"It's a visceral ride, and by the time you get to the ending you're drained. [Director Neil] Marshall had a number of endings in mind when he shot the film, so he was open [to making a switch].\" Marshall compared the change to the ending of \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\", saying, \"Just because she gets away, does that make it a happy ending?\" The ending is featured on DVD as an \"unrated cut\" in the United States.\n\nIn the film, the women encounter underground creatures referred to as crawlers by the production crew. Marshall described the crawlers as cavemen who have stayed underground. The director explained, \"They've evolved in this environment over thousands of years. They've adapted perfectly to thrive in the cave. They've lost their eyesight, they have acute hearing and smell and function perfectly in the pitch black. They're expert climbers, so they can go up any rock face and that is their world.\" Filmmakers kept the crawler design hidden from the actresses until they were revealed in the scenes in which the characters encountered the creatures, to allow for natural tension.\n\nDirector Neil Marshall first chose to have a dark cave as the setting for his horror film \"The Descent\" then decided to add the element of the crawlers, describing them as \"something that could get the women, something human, but not quite\". The crawlers were depicted as cavemen who never left the caves and evolved in the dark. The director included mothers and children in the colony of creatures, defining his vision, \"It is a colony and I thought that was far more believable than making them the classic monsters. If they had been all male, it would have made no sense, so I wanted to create a more realistic context for them. I wanted to have this very feral, very primal species living underground, but I wanted to make them human. I didn't want to make them aliens because humans are the scariest things.\"\n\nThe crawlers were designed by Paul Hyett, a makeup and prosthetics creator. Production designer Simon Bowles said that the crawler design had started out as \"wide-eyed and more creature-like\", but the design shifted toward a more human appearance. Crawlers originally had pure white skin, but the look was adjusted to seem grubbier. The skin was originally phosphorescent in appearance, but the effect was too bright and reflective in the darkened set, so the adjustment was made for them to blend in shadows. The director barred the film's cast from seeing the actors in full crawler make-up until their first appearance on screen. Actress Natalie Mendoza said of the effect, \"When the moment came, I nearly wet my pants! I was running around afterwards, laughing in this hysterical way and trying to hide the fact that I was pretty freaked out. Even after that scene, we never really felt comfortable with them.\"\n\nThe crawlers reappear in \"The Descent Part 2\", a sequel by Jon Harris with the first film's director Neil Marshall as executive producer. For the sequel, Hyett improved the camouflaging ability of the crawlers' skin tones to deliver better scares. According to Hyett, \"Jon wanted them more viciously feral, inbred, scarred and deformed, with rows of sharklike teeth for ripping flesh.\" A charnel house was designed for the crawlers as well as a set that the crew called the \"Crawler Crapper\".\n\nRene Rodriguez of \"The Miami Herald\" described the crawlers as \"blind, snarling cave-dwellers, looking much like Gollum's bigger kin\". Douglas Tseng of \"The Straits Times\" also noted that the crawlers looked similar to Gollum, being a cross between the creature and the vampiric Reapers from \"Blade II\". David Germain of the Associated Press noted of the crawlers, \"[They] have evolved to suit their environment—eyes blind because of the darkness in which they dwell, skin slimy and gray, ears batlike to channel their super-hearing.\" The crawlers are sexually dimorphic, with males being completely bald, whilst females sport thick dark hair on their heads. They are nocturnal hunters which surface from their caves to hunt for prey and bring the spoils of their hunts to their caverns.\n\nThe skull of women motif used in some advertising material is based on Philippe Halsman's \"In Voluptas Mors\" photograph.\n\nThe film's marketing campaign in the United Kingdom was disrupted by the London bombings in July 2005. Advertisements on London's public transport system (including the bus that had exploded) had included posters that carried the quote, \"Outright terror... bold and brilliant\", and depicted a terrified woman screaming in a tunnel. The film's theatrical distributor in the UK, Pathé, recalled the posters from their placement in the London Underground and reworked the campaign to exclude the word \"terror\" from advertised reviews of \"The Descent\". Pathé also distributed the new versions to TV and radio stations. The distributor's marketing chief, Anna Butler, said of the new approach, \"We changed tack to concentrate on the women involved all standing together and fighting back. That seemed to chime with the prevailing mood of defiance that set in the weekend after the bombs.\" Neil Marshall stated in a review \"Shauna was pretty upset about it; it was on newspapers all across the county\" and cites the attacks as harming the film's box office, as \"people were still trapped underground in reality, so no one really wanted to go see a film about people trapped underground...\". Many commentators, including writers for \"Variety\" and \"The Times\", remarked on the rather unfortunate coincidence.\n\nDue to these events there was some initial concern that the film's release might have been delayed out of sensitivity for the tragedy but Pathé ultimately chose to release the film on schedule, with a slightly retooled advertising campaign; however, the US promotional campaign managed by Lionsgate Films was significantly different from the original European version.\n\n\"The Descent\" premiered at the Edinburgh horror film festival Dead by Dawn on 6 July 2005. The film opened commercially to the public in the UK on 10 July 2005, showing on 329 screens and earned £2.6 million. The film received limited releases in other European countries. The London bombings in the same month was reported to have affected the box office performance of \"The Descent\".\n\nThe film has received critical acclaim. Based on 177 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, it received an 85% \"Certified Fresh\" overall approval rating with an average rating of 7.35/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Deft direction and strong performances from its all-female cast guide \"The Descent\", a riveting, claustrophobic horror film\". By comparison, Metacritic calculated an average score of 71 out of 100 from 30 reviews. On its debut weekend in the US, \"The Descent\" opened with a three-day gross of $8.8 million, and finished with $26,005,908. Total worldwide box office receipts are $57,051,053.\n\nRoger Ebert's editor, Jim Emerson, reviewed the film for Ebert's column whilst Ebert was on leave due to surgery, giving it four out of four stars. He wrote, \"This is the fresh, exciting summer movie I've been wanting for months. Or for years, it seems.\"\n\nManohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" described \"The Descent\" as \"one of the better horror entertainments of the last few years\", calling it \"indisputably and pleasurably nerve-jangling\". Dargis applauded the claustrophobic atmosphere of the film, though she perceived sexual overtones in the all-female cast with their laboured breathing and sweaty clothing. Rene Rodriguez of \"The Miami Herald\" thought that the film devolved into a guessing game of who would survive, though he praised Marshall's \"nightmare imagery\" for generating scares that work better than other horror films. Rodriguez also noted the attempt to add dimension to the female characters but felt that the actresses were unable to perform.\n\nTop ten lists, 2006:\n\nBloody Disgusting ranked the film third in their list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade', with the article saying \"One of the scariest films of this or any decade... Ultimately, The Descent is the purest kind of horror film – ruthless, unforgiving, showing no mercy.\" In the early 2010s, \"Time Out\" conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. \"The Descent\" placed at number 39 on their top 100 list.\n\nLawrence Toppman of \"The Charlotte Observer\" thought a weakness of \"The Descent\" was the failure of the writer to explain the evolution of the creature, though he said, \"Their clicking and howling, used for echolocation and communication, makes them more alien; this otherness gives humans permission to mutilate them without seeming too disgusting to be sympathetic.\" Michael Wilmington of the \"Chicago Tribune\" thought that the crawlers should have been left out of the film, believing, \"Watching those gray, slithering beings chasing and biting the women makes it hard to maintain any suspension of disbelief.\"\n\n\"The Descent\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 26, 2006.\n\nA sequel to \"The Descent\" was filmed at Ealing Studios in London during 2008 and was released on December 2, 2009 in the UK.\n\n"}
{"id": "2253393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253393", "title": "Siege of Jerusalem (1187)", "text": "Siege of Jerusalem (1187)\n\nThe Siege of Jerusalem was a siege on the city of Jerusalem that lasted from September 20 to October 2, 1187, when Balian of Ibelin surrendered the city to Saladin. Though Jerusalem fell, it was not the end of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, as the capital shifted first to Tyre and later to Acre after the Third Crusade. Latin Christians responded in 1189 by launching the Third Crusade led by Richard the Lionheart, Philip Augustus, and Frederick Barbarossa separately.\n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem, weakened by internal disputes, was defeated at the Battle of Hattin on 4 July 1187. Most of the nobility were taken prisoner, including King Guy. Thousands of Muslim slaves were freed. By mid-September, Saladin had taken Acre, Nablus, Jaffa, Toron, Sidon, Beirut, and Ascalon. The survivors of the battle and other refugees fled to Tyre, the only city able to hold out against Saladin, due to the fortuitous arrival of Conrad of Montferrat.\n\nIn Tyre, Balian of Ibelin had asked Saladin for safe passage to Jerusalem to retrieve his wife Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem and their family. Saladin granted his request, provided that Balian not take up arms against him and not remain in Jerusalem for more than one day; however, upon arrival in the holy city, Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem, Queen Sibylla, and the rest of the inhabitants begged him to take charge of the defense of the city. Heraclius, who argued that he must stay for the sake of Christianity, offered to absolve him of the oath, and Balian agreed.\n\nHe sent word of his decision to Saladin at Ascalon via a deputation of burgesses, who rejected the sultan's proposals for a negotiated surrender of Jerusalem; however, Saladin arranged for an escort to accompany Maria, their children, and all their household to Tripoli. As the highest-ranking lord remaining in Jerusalem, according to the chronicler Ibn al-Athir, Balian was seen by the Muslims as holding a rank \"more or less equal to that of a king.\"\n\nBalian found the situation in Jerusalem dire. The city was filled with refugees fleeing Saladin's conquests, with more arriving daily. There were fewer than fourteen knights in the whole city, so he created sixty new knights from the ranks of the squires (knights in training) and burgesses. He prepared for the inevitable siege by storing food and money. The armies of Syria and Egypt assembled under Saladin, and after conquering Acre, Jaffa, and Caesarea, though he unsuccessfully besieged Tyre, the sultan arrived outside Jerusalem on September 20.\n\nAfter a brief reconnoitre around the city, Saladin's army came to a rest before the Tower of David and the Damascus Gate. His archers continually pelted the ramparts with arrows. Siege towers/belfries were rolled up to the walls but were pushed back each time. For six days, skirmishes were fought with little result. Saladin's forces suffered heavy casualties after each assault. On September 26, Saladin moved his camp to a different part of the city, on the Mount of Olives where there was no major gate from which the crusaders could counter-attack. The walls were constantly pounded by the siege engines, catapults, mangonels, petraries, Greek fire, crossbows, and arrows. A portion of the wall was mined, and it collapsed on September 29. The crusaders were unable to push Saladin's troops back from the breach, but at the same time, the Muslims could not gain entrance to the city. Soon there were only a few dozen knights and a handful of remaining men-at-arms defending the wall, as no more men could be found even for the promise of an enormous fee.\n\nThe civilians were in great despair. According to a passage possibly written by Ernoul, a squire of Balian, in the \"Old French Continuation of William of Tyre\", the clergy organized a barefoot procession around the walls, much as the clergy on the First Crusade had done outside the walls in 1099. At Mount Calvary, women cropped their children's hair, after immersing them chin-deep in basins of cold water. These penances were aimed at turning away God's wrath from the city, but \"…Our Lord did not deign to hear the prayers or noise that was made in the city. For the stench of adultery, of disgusting extravagance and of sin against nature would not let their prayers rise to God.\" \n\nAt the end of September, Balian rode out with an envoy to meet with the sultan, offering surrender. Saladin told Balian that he had sworn to take the city by force, and would only accept an unconditional surrender. Saladin told Balian that Saladin's banner had been raised on the city wall, but his army was driven back. Balian threatened that the defenders would destroy the Muslim holy places, slaughter their own families and the 5000 Muslim slaves, and burn all the wealth and treasures of the Crusaders. Saladin, who wanted to take the city with as little bloodshed of his fellow Muslims as possible, insisted that the Crusaders were to unconditionally surrender but could leave by paying a ransom of ten dinars for men, five for women and two for children; those who couldn't pay would be enslaved. Balian told him that there were 20,000 in the city who could never pay that amount. Saladin proposed a total of 100,000 dinars to free all the 20,000 Crusaders who were unable to pay. Balian complained that the Christian authorities could never raise such a sum. He proposed that 7,000 of them would be freed for a sum of 30,000 dinars, and Saladin agreed.\n\nOn Balian's orders, the Crusaders surrendered the city to Saladin's army on October 2. The take-over of the city was relatively peaceful especially in contrast to the Crusader siege of the city in 1099. Balian paid 30,000 dinars for freeing 7,000 of those unable to pay from the treasury of the city. The large golden Christian cross that had been placed over the Dome of the Rock by the Crusaders was pulled down and all Muslim prisoners of war taken by the Crusaders were released by Saladin. According to the Kurdish scholar and historian Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, these numbered close to 3,000. Saladin allowed many of the noblewomen of the city to leave without paying any ransom. For example, a Byzantine queen living a monastic life in the city was allowed to leave the city with her retinue and associates, as was Sibylla, the queen of Jerusalem and wife of the captured King Guy. Saladin also granted her safe passage to visit her captive husband in Nablus. The native Christians were allowed to remain in the city while those of Crusader origin were allowed to leave Jerusalem for other lands along with their goods through a safe passage via Akko by paying a ransom of 10 dinars. Saladin's brother Al-Adil was moved by the sight and asked Saladin for 1,000 of them as a reward for his services. Saladin granted his wish and Al-Adil immediately released them all. Heraclius, upon seeing this, asked Saladin for some slaves to liberate. He was granted 700 while Balian was granted 500 and all of them were freed by them. All the aged people who could not pay the ransom were freed by orders of Saladin and allowed to leave the city. Saladin then proceeded to free 1,000 more captives upon request of Muzaffar al-Din Ibn Ali Kuchuk, who claimed they were from his hometown of Urfa. In order to control the departing population, Saladin ordered the gates of the city to be closed. At each gate of the city, a commander was placed to check the movement of the Crusaders and make sure only those who paid the ransom left the city. Saladin then assigned some of his officers the job of ensuring the safe arrival of the Crusaders in Christian lands. 15,000 of those who could not pay the ransom were sold into slavery. According to Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani, 7,000 of them were men and 8,000 were women and children.\n\nOn Saladin's orders, the ransomed inhabitants marched away in three columns accompanied by 50 cavalrymen of Saladin's army. The Knights Templar and Hospitallers led the first two, with Balian and the Patriarch leading the third. Balian joined his wife and family in the County of Tripoli. The refugees first reached Tyre, where only men who could fight were allowed to enter by Conrad of Montferrat. The remaining refugees went to the County of Tripoli, which was under Crusader control. They were denied entrance and robbed of their possessions by raiding parties from within the city. Most of the less affluent refugees went to Armenian and Antiochian territories and were later successful in gaining entrance into Antioch. The remaining refugees fled from Ascalon to Alexandria, where they were housed in makeshift stockades and received hospitable treatment from the city officials and elders. They then boarded Italian ships which arrived from Pisa, Genoa and Venice in March 1188. The captains of the ships at first refused to take the refugees since they were not being paid for them and did not have supplies for them. The governor of Alexandria, who had earlier taken the oars of the ships for payment of taxes, refused to grant sailing permits to the captains until they agreed. The latter then agreed to take the refugees along with them and were made to swear decent treatment and safe arrival of the refugees before they left.\n\nAfter the surrender of the city, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was ordered to be closed for three days by Saladin while he considered what to do with it. Some of his advisers told him to destroy the Church in order to end all Christian interest in Jerusalem. Most of his advisers, however, told him to spare the Church, saying that Christian pilgrimages would continue anyway because of the sanctity of the place and also reminded him of the Caliph Umar, who allowed the Church to remain in Christian hands after conquering the city. Saladin ultimately decided not to destroy the church, saying that he had no intention to discourage Christian pilgrimages to the site; it was reopened after three days on his orders. The Frankish pilgrims were allowed to enter the church upon paying a fee. To solidify Muslim claims to Jerusalem, many holy sites, including the shrine known as Al-Aqsa Mosque, were ritually purified with rose water. Christian furnishings were removed from the mosque and it was fitted with oriental carpets. Its walls were illuminated with candelabras and text from the Quran. The Orthodox Christians and Syriacs were allowed to remain and to worship as they chose. The Copts, who were barred from entering Jerusalem by the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem as they were considered heretics and atheists, were allowed to enter the city without paying any fees by Saladin as he considered them his subjects. The Coptic places of worship that were earlier taken over by the Crusaders were returned to the Coptic priests. The Copts were also allowed to visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other Christian sites. The Abyssinian Christians were allowed to visit the holy places of Jerusalem without paying any fees.\n\nThe Byzantine emperor, Isaac Angelus, sent a message to Saladin congratulating him on taking the city, requesting him to convert all the churches in the city back to the Orthodox church and all Christian ceremonies to be performed according to the Greek Orthodox liturgy. His request was granted and the rights of other confessions were preserved. The local Christians were allowed to pray freely in their churches and the control of Christian affairs was handed over to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nSaladin went on to capture a number of other castles that were still holding out against him, including Belvoir, Kerak, and Montreal, and returned to Tyre to besiege it for a second time.\n\nMeanwhile, news of the disastrous defeat at Hattin was brought to Europe by Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre, as well as other pilgrims and travellers, while Saladin was conquering the rest of the kingdom throughout the summer of 1187. Plans were immediately made for a new crusade; on October 29, Pope Gregory VIII issued the bull \"Audita tremendi\", even before hearing of the fall of Jerusalem. In England and France, the Saladin tithe was enacted in order to finance expenses. The Third Crusade did not get underway until 1189, in three separate contingents led by Richard I of England, Philip II of France, and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nMuch of the film \"Kingdom of Heaven\" focuses on the siege, though this version is highly fictionalized and highly inaccurate.\n\n"}

His presence insured that the regiment \"distinguished itself by its humanity\". When the regiment was demobilized, most of the soldiers found themselves unemployed and destitute. He led them to Canada, where they received a grant of land for their service.\n\nWhen Macdonell arrived in 1804, he found three priests and three churches in Upper Canada. By his energy and perseverance he induced a considerable immigration to the province, and left at his death forty-eight churches attended by thirty priests, plus a seminary and a college.\n\nAlexander Macdonell was born 17 July 1760/62 at his father's house in Glen Urquhart. His early education was at Bourblach, Loch Morar. Around 1775 he went to the Scots Colleges at Paris and Valladolid. He was ordained a priest on 16 February 1787 at Valladolid. Returning to his native land he exercised the ministry for five years in Lochaber, where he was known as \"Big Sandy\" or \"Mr. Alistair\".\n\nIn 1792 his people were evicted from their homes during the Highland Clearances. Despite the fact that, the penal laws still being enforced, being a Catholic priest he was an outlaw, Macdonell involved himself in their affairs and persuaded Glasgow business men to employ them while he acted as the Highlanders priest and interpreter (for they were Catholics in a predominantly Protestant town and spoke Scottish Gaelic not Scottish English). He also used his influence on behalf of some from Barra who attempted to emigrate but wound up shipwrecked and destitute near Glasgow. In May 1792, with permission of the apostolic vicar, Macdonell took up residence in Glasgow and found work for about 800 Highlanders.\n\nWithin two years after the Highlanders' arrival in Glasgow, the Revolution on the Continent ruined the export trade of Glasgow and deprived them of their livelihood. The only avenue open to the unemployed was service in the militia, but even this was closed to the Glengarry men, who, being Catholics, could not take the required oath for enlistment. Father Macdonell then drafted a proposal that the Highlanders be commissioned as a Catholic regiment in service to the government. Clan chief Alexander Ranaldson Macdonell and John Fletcher of Dunans went to London and presented the documents to King George III, along with letters of commendation from the Glasgow merchants. Letters of service were accordingly issued in August, 1794. Though contrary to the then existing law, Father Alexander Macdonell was gazetted as chaplain to the regiment, thus becoming the first Catholic chaplain in the British Army since the Reformation. A Presbyterian clergyman was appointed as well for those of that persuasion. More than half the regiment that numbered 800, were from the area of Glengarry. In June, 1795, the regiment was deployed to Guernsey, where it remained until the summer of 1798, when it was moved to Ireland.\n\nThe Glengarry Fencibles were sent to Ireland during the Rebellion of 1798. The regiment saw action at Laggan Hill and was involved in some skirmishing at Kilkenny, Hackett's Town and New Ross.\nAn American bishop gave testimony to the chaplain's services: \"The memory of Father Macdonell is as green in those regions as the fields they cultivate. That holy, chivalrous priest saved the lives of many innocent Irishmen and restored the chapels to their original purpose.\"\n\nWhen the regiment was disbanded in Glasgow in 1802, Rev. Macdonell appealed to the government to grant its members land in Canada. The government countered with a proposal for the recently acquired island of Trinidad, but Macdonell held fast. Influential lairds and landholders raised objections to \"depopulating\" the land, and the Emigration Act rigidly enforced. With all the obstacles placed in his way, Bernard Kelly says, \"he may be literally said 'to have smuggled his friends away'\" \n\nFather Macdonell arrived at York, Upper Canada (now Toronto), 1 November, 1804, and proceeded to settle the people on the lands granted by the British government. The area was part of the Diocese of Quebec. Macdonell, was assigned to the mission of St. Raphael's in Glengarry, which he made his headquarters for twenty-five years. On his arrival he found three priests in the province, the Rev. Roderick Macdonell at St. Andrews and St. Regis, the Rev. Francis Fitzimmons in Glengarry, and the Rev. Father Richard at Sandwich. \nThe Rev. Roderick Macdonell died in 1806 and Father Fitzimmons removed shortly afterwards to New Brunswick; this left Father Macdonell in charge of the whole province for the next ten years with limited assistance.\n\nHe was obliged to travel over through the province, carrying the requisites for Mass, and the administration of the sacraments, sometimes on horseback, sometimes in birch canoes, and sometimes on foot. In 1812, he raised another regiment, the Glengarry Light Infantry Fencibles, which came to the defence of Upper Canada in the War of 1812. William Foster Coffin would later liken McDonell to “a medieval churchman, half bishop, half baron, [who] fought and prayed, with equal zeal, by the side of men he had come to regard as his hereditary followers.”\n\nSt. Raphael's Catholic Church was built around 1821. It was one of the oldest churches in what was then Upper Canada. In late 1970, the church interiors, roof and tower were destroyed by fire. In 1973, a smaller church with the same name was built, attached to the ruins.\n\nIn 1817 Upper Canada was set apart from the See of Quebec as a vicariate Apostolic, and two years later Father Macdonell was appointed vicar Apostolic, his consecration as Bishop of Rhosina taking place in the Ursuline chapel, Quebec, on 31 December, 1820. A significant incident was the gift to Bishop Macdonell of a magnificent episcopal ring by King George IV. Six years later, 14 February, 1826, the vicariate was raised to a bishopric by Pope Leo XII, and Bishop Macdonell then became the first Bishop of Upper Canada with his see at Kingston.\n\nBishop Macdonell's thorough knowledge of the country and its people and his great administrative ability made his counsel desirable to the government, and on 12 October, 1831, he was called to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada, and thereafter was accorded the title \"Honourable\". \n\nHe founded churches and schools and in 1839 established Regiopolis College, which offered academic and theological training to Roman Catholic youth. The original building has been part of the Hotel Dieu Hospital (Kingston, Ontario) on Sydenham Street, Kingston, Ontario since 1892.\n\nBishop Macdonell died from pneumonia on 14 January 1840, aged 77 in Dumfries, Scotland, where he had gone with the hope of interesting Irish and Scotch bishops in a plan of emigration and to raise funds for the college. He was buried in the crypt of St. Margaret's Convent chapel, Edinburgh, but his remains were subsequently removed to Canada and interred in Kingston Cathedral 26 September 1861. \n\nThere is a tablet to his memory in St. Raphael's, Alexandria, erected 18 June 1843, by the Highland Society of Canada, which Macdonell had founded.\n\nThe town of Alexandria in North Glengarry, Ontario is named after him.\n\nIn Guelph, Ontario, Canada, a Catholic secondary school was renamed to Bishop Macdonell Catholic High School in 1962 and Macdonell Street at the foot of Church of Our Lady Immaculate is named in his honour.\n\nMacdonell Street in Kingston, Ontario is named after him.\n\nWhen MacDonell resided in Toronto after returning from Europe he resided in a house on the south-east corner of Nelson (today's Jarvis) and Duchess (today's Richmond) Streets. The house, built in 1832, still stands, although it has been remade into a restaurant. It is a designated heritage building.\n\n\n"}

Hevesi (born January 31, 1940) is a former American politician and convicted felon who served as a New York State Assemblyman from 1971 to 1993, as New York City Comptroller from 1994 to 2001, and as New York State Comptroller from 2003 to 2006. Hevesi is originally from Queens, New York City.\n\nA member of the Democratic Party, Hevesi was elected State Comptroller in 2002 and reelected in 2006. He resigned from office effective December 22, 2006, as part of a plea bargain with the Albany County Court related to his unlawful use of state employees to care for his ailing wife.\n\nIn February 2007, Hevesi was sentenced to a $5,000 fine and permanently banned from holding elective office again; he received no jail time and no probation. \n\nHevesi also pleaded guilty to corruption charges surrounding a \"pay to play\" scheme regarding the New York State Pension Fund; on April 15, 2011, he was sentenced to one to four years in prison.\n\nHevesi's parents were Jewish immigrants from Hungary. They left Hungary in 1938 to escape the Nazis, and 55 of their relatives died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Hevesi's father was Dr. Eugene Hevesi (1896–1983), a Hungarian-born American Jewish leader who served as foreign affairs secretary for the American Jewish Committee and as representative to the United Nations for several Jewish NGOs. His late brother Dennis Hevesi was a reporter for \"The New York Times\". \n\nHevesi earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1962 from Queens College, CUNY. He received a Ph.D. in public law and government from Columbia University in 1971. The title of his doctoral dissertation was \"Legislative Leadership in New York State\". Hevesi taught political science at Queens College for more than 30 years.\n\nHevesi and his wife Carol are residents of Forest Hills, Queens, New York. Their sons, New York State Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi and former New York State Senator Daniel Hevesi, have both had careers in politics.\n\nOn November 2, 1971, Hevesi was elected to the New York State Assembly to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Emanuel R. Gold. He took his seat during a special session in December 1971. Hevesi served in the Assembly for 22 years.\n\nHevesi unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Nomination for City Comptroller in 1989; he was defeated by Brooklyn District Attorney and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. In 1993, he defeated Holtzman to secure the Democratic nomination. Hevesi then defeated former Congressman Herman Badillo, the Republican candidate, in the general election.\n\nBy December 1997, Hevesi as Comptroller of the City of New York enlisted the weight and soundness of his City's finances in the cause of forcing Swiss banks to meet the demands of the World Jewish Congress and other organizations then suing Swiss banks over Nazi-era bank balances the WJC said was owing to the heirs of victims of the Holocaust, joined eventually by both then-Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani and then-Governor of New York State George Pataki. In his book on the subject, Norman Finkelstein dubs him \"the godfather of Holocaust restitution sanctions.\"\n\nHe recruited the financial officers of many other states and municipalities in the US to similarly place the powers and responsibilities entrusted to them by their employers at the service of this cause, at one point calling them to a conference in his own city at which they discussed ways and means of coordinating their individual actions for maximum effect. Sanctions against Switzerland having seemed successful in securing the $1.25 billion (1999) settlement, Hevesi then brought the power of the ad hoc network he had constructed to bear in subsequent actions against Germany, Austria, and other countries, where its use was deemed successful in raising the amounts of the settlements. \n\nHevesi served as New York City Comptroller from 1994 to 2002, when he was term-limited out of the office.\n\nIn 2001, Hevesi sought the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York, running on the platform of \"Most Experienced, Best Qualified\". He finished fourth, behind Public Advocate Mark J. Green, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, and New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone. Hevesi was the Liberal Party nominee for mayor in the general election, but did not campaign, instead endorsing Green. Following his defeat in the mayor's race, Hevesi started his campaign for state comptroller, which he won, defeating Republican John Faso in 2002.\n\nIn November 2006, Hevesi was reelected as New York State Comptroller. On December 22, 2006, CNN reported, \"[N]ew York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi entered into a plea agreement which included his immediate resignation Friday to avoid a felony indictment by a New York State grand jury charging him with defrauding the government by having staffers drive his wife and assist her in with personal matters from 2003–2006. Hevesi pleaded guilty to Superior Court Filing of defrauding the government, a Class E felony, and will pay a $5,000 fine. Hevesi admitted the wrongdoing when allegations surfaced in November, and has repaid the state more than $200,000.\"\n\nAt a commencement address he delivered at Queens College on June 1, 2006, Hevesi told his audience that U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) was so tough he would \"put a bullet between the President's eyes if he could get away with it.\" Several hours after his remarks, Hevesi apologized for his comments, calling them \" beyond stupid, beyond moronic, totally offensive,\" and \"incredibly moronic.\"\n\nOn September 21, 2006, Alan Hevesi admitted that he used Nicholas Acquafredda, a state employee and member of Hevesi's security detail, to drive and aid his ailing wife. Hevesi claimed that in 2003, the State Ethics Commission decided that he should pay back the entire cost of having a state employee chauffeur his wife unless such services were necessary for safety purposes. A spokesperson from the State Ethics Commission denied that such a decision was made.\n\nOn September 26, 2006, after his Republican challenger, Christopher Callaghan, asked the Albany County District Attorney's office to investigate the matter, Hevesi said he would reimburse the state more than $82,000 for having a public employee chauffeur his wife. Callaghan first phoned in the complaint to the State Comptroller's own hotline. Hevesi had admitted the previous week that he had not previously reimbursed the state. Callaghan and the 2006 Republican nominee for Governor, John Faso, also called for Hevesi's resignation. Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who was then running for Governor of New York, withdrew his endorsement of Hevesi. The controversy stimulated interest in the candidacies of Callaghan and minor party candidates Julia Willebrand of the Green Party and John Cain of the Libertarian Party.\n\nHevesi claimed that drivers were needed to provide security to his wife, though a bipartisan ethics panel concluded that the State Police found no threat that would justify such an arrangement. The panel also concluded that Hevesi had no intention of repaying the state for the services rendered to his wife until Callaghan publicly filed a complaint.\n\nOn October 12, 2006, Albany County District Attorney David Soares' office acknowledged that it was officially investigating actions by Hevesi regarding the public employee hired to chauffeur his wife.\n\nOn October 23, 2006, the \"Ethics Commission concluded that Hevesi had 'knowingly' violated state law.\" On November 3, 2006, Hevesi was ordered by the office of state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to reimburse the state $90,000 — in addition to the $83,000 he has already paid – in compensation for what had been deemed an improper use of a state employee. Hevesi apologized in a TV ad, stating, \"I'm asking you to weigh my mistake against my 35 years of public service, I'm human...I'm a good comptroller who did a dumb thing.\"\n\nOn December 12, 2006, Hevesi agreed to a deal that called for the $90,000 in escrow money to be turned over to the state and for him to pay an additional $33,605 within 10 days, making his payback total (with $83,000 already paid) $206,000. According to the Attorney General's report, Hevesi had actually hired four (not two) employees as his wife's \"security detail\", and said employees ran personal errands for the Hevesi family. On December 13, 2006, a poll conducted between December 5–11 by Quinnipiac showed that 45% of people in New York believed that Hevesi should resign, while 43% believed that he had paid his debt to the state.\n\nOn December 14, 2006, the Albany County District Attorney acknowledged that he had a strong enough case to indict Hevesi. In February 2007, after Hevesi had pleaded guilty in December 2006 to a charge of defrauding the government, he was sentenced by Judge Stephen Herrick in Albany County Court to a $5,000 fine and barred permanently from elected office. As part of the plea deal, he was given no jail time and received no probation. Prior to sentencing, Hevesi paid the state more than $200,000 in restitution. He expressed remorse for his actions and told the judge: \"I'm culpable, I'm responsible and I apologize.\"\n\nOn October 6, 2009, Raymond Harding, chairman of the Liberal Party of New York, pleaded guilty to charges that he accepted $800,000 from Hevesi's aides when Hevesi was comptroller of the state of New York.\n\nAs state comptroller, Hevesi faced a conflict of interest allegation in relation to a private capital fund named Markstone Capital Partners, according to a report in the \"New York Sun\". The opening paragraph stated, \"The New York State comptroller, Alan Hevesi, encouraged California pension managers to invest in a private capital fund founded by a man whose wife has been a generous donor to his political campaigns.\" The story originally appeared in \"The Los Angeles Times\".\n\nHevesi met with his California counterpart, comptroller Steve Westly, and Elliott Broidy of Markstone Capital Group. They met on May 19, 2003, in order to \"pitch\" the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) to invest in Markstone, a fund that invested in Israeli companies. The \"Sun\" reported that in June 2003, Mr. Hevesi invested $200 million in Markstone. Mr. Broidy is a major Republican political contributor. Mr. Broidy did not directly contribute to Hevesi's political campaigns, but his wife, Robin Rosenzweig, had contributed $80,000 since 2002 — $30,000 before the May 2003 meeting and $50,000 afterwards. She also contributed to Andrew Hevesi's State Assembly race. \n\nOn October 7, 2010, Hevesi pleaded guilty to accepting gratuities for steering the investment funds to California venture capitalist Elliot Broidy. Hevesi had accepted $75,000 in trips for himself and his family and $500,000 in campaign contributions, and benefited from $380,000 given to a lobbyist.\n\nIn October 2010, after being accused of \"pay to play\" practices involving the New York State Pension Fund during his tenure as Comptroller, Hevesi pleaded guilty to a corruption charge; on April 15, 2011, he was sentenced to one to four years in prison. He began his prison term on April 17, 2011. Hevesi went before a parole board on November 14, 2012 and was released on parole on December 19, 2012. He served twenty months of a maximum four-year sentence.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The game also utilized \"runes\" as a way to magically gain abilities or items.\n\nThe game had several features typical of dungeon crawls, such as random treasure, weapon and armor options, treasure chests, and the use of a mannequin to visually aid in inventory management.\n\nThe dungeon in \"The Summoning\" was broken up into separate levels and sections, with different types of monsters (such as undead) and NPCs being found in each.\n\nThe featured weapon in the game is a large two-handed blade called \"Warmonger.\" When first found, it is rusty and not very effective. But by repeatedly using it to kill, the magical blade becomes an immensely powerful weapon. The blade is actually a sentient, evil being with bloodlust.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\"s Samuel B.

It was released in 2003 on Matador Records. The album features guest appearances by Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters, Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Warren Ellis of the Dirty Three.\n\n\"You Are Free\" was recorded over the course of a year, the longest Marshall had spent recording an album at that point. Marshall and engineer Adam Kasper recorded about 40 songs during these sessions. \n\nIn a 2003 interview with \"Pitchfork\", Marshall explained the album was recorded \"Sporadically. While I was traveling...Adam was working on other things, and I worked on his schedule. He'd get these really nice studios, and when he had off time we'd go in and then try to remember what we did like two months ago and pull that tape up. I'd be like, 'Uh, no, I wanna do something new,' and then I'd write a new song. So it basically worked like that-- every few months getting together and essentially writing new songs.\" According to Marshall, Kasper helped her decide which of the 40 songs they recorded should make it onto the album.\n\nMarshall revealed that she chose Kasper because \"I was looking for somebody who would let me do what I wanted to do, who's a really good engineer,\" and said that she saw him as an engineer, rather than a producer.\n\nNumerous songs on the album are performed solo, with only Marshall on vocals and guitar or piano. Grohl plays drums on the songs \"Speak For Me,\" \"He War\" and \"Shaking Paper,\" and plays bass on \"Shaking Paper.\" Vedder provides backing vocals on \"Good Woman\" and \"Evolution,\" while Ellis plays violin on \"Werewolf.\"\n\nThe songs \"Good Woman\" and \"Werewolf\" feature string arrangements by David Campbell, which were recorded after Marshall's vocals had been completed, at the Boat Studio in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\"You Are Free\", Marshall's first album of original material since the critically acclaimed \"Moon Pix\" (1998), has received widespread critical acclaim since its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 82, based on 26 reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\".\n\nKelefa Sanneh of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"\"Free\" may be her most beautiful album, as well as her cagiest: There are gaunt rock songs and ramshackle ballads, all painted with bold, sure strokes that belie her ambivalence.\" Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote that \"\"You Are Free\" may take awhile longer than expected to unfold, but once it does, its excellence is undeniable.\" Chris Ott of \"Pitchfork\" called it an album \"full of arresting, serene beauty...Sans a handful of lesser inclusions and tributes, the imaginary, shorter version of \"You Are Free\" is flawless.\"\n\nIn 2009, \"Pitchfork\" placed the album at number 98 on their \"The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s\" list.\n\n\"Werewolf\" is on the soundtrack of Pedro Almodóvar's 2009 film \"Broken Embraces\".\n\n\"You Are Free\" became Cat Power's first album to chart on the \"Billboard\" 200, reaching number 105. The album also debuted at number one 1 on \"Billboard\"s Heatseekers Albums Chart. As of 2007, \"You Are Free\" has sold over 163,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

It was released in 2000 on Matador Records.\n\nThe album consists almost entirely of cover songs, with the exception of a new version of Marshall's song \"In this Hole,\" which initially appeared on Cat Power's 1996 album \"What Would the Community Think\".\n\nThe success of Cat Power’s fourth album, \"Moon Pix\" (1998), led to high expectations for her follow-up, and made it difficult for her to live what she called “a normal life.” She elected to release an album of covers in part because she felt more comfortable playing covers than her own material. Between \"Moon Pix\" and what became \"The Covers Record\", she scheduled a number of solo shows during which she played only covers. In order to take attention away from herself, she projected the 1928 French silent film \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" behind her onstage.\n\nMarshall’s decision to release a covers album was disappointing to Matador, who considered her a “genius songwriter” and wanted to capitalize on the success of \"Moon Pix\". According to Gerard Cosloy, the promotional campaign for \"The Covers Record\", which he calls “a great album,” was intentionally “muted,” in order to allow it to “find its audience.” However, Marshall saw \"The Covers Record\" as a personal and important release, and interpreted this as lack of faith on the record company’s behalf in the record’s ability to connect with her audience.\n\nMarshall's contract for \"The Covers Record\" was allegedly drafted on the spot on a Post-it note.\n\n\"The Covers Record\" features sparse instrumentation, with only Marshall on vocals and guitar or piano. The song “Salty Dog” features guitar by American musician Matt Sweeney.\n\nThe album was recorded at Night Owl Studios, Kampo Studios and Rare Book Room Studios, in New York City, in 1998 and 1999. According to Marshall, “I ended up in the studio recording with this young man at this place called Night Owl Studios across from Penn Station. I did most of the songs there just very, very, very, very quickly, and there’s like four songs that are from different recording sessions.”\n\nRob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" called the album \"a stopgap\" until the release of her next album of original material, but described her stripped-down version of the Rolling Stones' \"Satisfaction\" as \"powerful.\" \"Spin\" called the album \"essential,\" and wrote, \"With only a guitar or piano, and a voice that is developing into one of the most expressive in rock, Marshall crafts deeply textured explorations of heartache, terror, longing, dismay, and emotions I'm pretty sure I've not found yet... Rock will see few finer releases this year.\" Rhapsody (online music service) praised the album, calling it one of their favorite cover albums.\n\nFoo Fighters singer and guitarist/ ex-Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl cited the album in a 2000 issue of \"NME\", saying, \"'Satisfaction' is the hit off that record, or so everybody thinks. But for me, it's that Velvet Underground song, \"I Found a Reason\". It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. My favourite.\" Grohl would work with Marshall on Cat Power's subsequent release, \"You Are Free\" (2003).\n\nIn 2005 the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the \"All Tomorrow's Parties\"-curated \"Don't Look Back\" series.\n\nSeveral songs on the album have been used in films, including \"I Found a Reason\" (\"Saving Face\", \"Dandelion\" and\"V for Vendetta\"), \"Sea of Love\" (\"Juno\"), and \"Wild Is the Wind\" (\"Into the Forest\").\n\n\nAlbum – \"Billboard\"\nAs of March 2003 it has sold 52,000 units in United States.

{"id": "2253437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253437", "title": "Dino Crisis 3", "text": "Dino Crisis 3\n\nThe game was originally planned for both Xbox and PlayStation 2, but the latter version was scrapped early in development.\n\nThe player can use 2 guns with 6 ammo types (one gun and 3 ammo types per playable character), in addition to small machines called \"WASPS\" that help against dinosaur encounters. The game is played mostly through the character Patrick and only a small section is played as Sonya. There are three types of body armor available.\n\nSet in the year 2548, it has been 300 years since Earth lost contact with the colony ship \"Ozymandias\", en route to a. Somehow, the ship has reappeared near Jupiter. A team called S.O.A.R. (Special Operations And Reconnaissance) is sent aboard the probe ship \"Seyfert\" to investigate. As the \"Seyfert\" sends out a shuttle to investigate the ship, its weapons suddenly activate. A beam destroys the \"Seyfert\" and then the shuttle, killing nearly everyone except for Patrick Tyler, Sonya Hart, Commander Jacob Ranshaw, and McCoy. Patrick and Sonya reunite on the exterior of the ship and gain access. The ship's interior is derelict, although there is still power.\n\nMcCoy boards as well but is killed by a large \"Tyrannosaurus\"-like creature which chases the team. The \"T. rex\" is then attacked, mauled and killed by a swarm of eel-like mutants. After fighting his way through the ship's storage areas, Patrick meets a survivor, a girl named Caren Velázquez. After meeting her, she runs away in fear.\n\nPatrick spots Caren once again, looking at a picture frame of her father, Dr. Miguel Velázquez. Patrick learns she has been on her own for 300 years. Sonya discovers that MTHR - the ship's control system - is creating the dinosaur-like creatures from the DNA of animals in storage as a replacement for the human crew. When Patrick tells them that he is shutting MTHR down, Caren opens the door and runs away.\n\nAs Caren and the team hurry out of the experimental laboratory, they are attacked by a mutant \"Ankylosaurus\" known as a Regulus. Jacob sacrifices himself to kill the mutant by setting off his grenades at the creature's mouth. At this point, it is revealed that Caren is an android.\n\nLater, the same beast reappears, revealing that Jacob's sacrifice is for naught. With no choice, Patrick has to put the Regulus to rest.\n\nCaren manages to repair the ship, saving Patrick from succumbing to the broken environmental systems. Patrick returns to the Energy Core to restart it, but the room is severely damaged when a mutant \"Spinosaurus\" crashes through the wall, filling the area with water coolant.\n\nAfter fighting off the creature, the team runs to the MTHR sector as the core begins to go into meltdown. As they arrive at the sector, the MTHR and Engine Sectors detach from the \"Front Deck\", Shaft and Energy Sectors, which are destroyed by the meltdown. The Engines soon activate an emergency system and Warp Jump to Earth.\n\nPatrick meets MTHR and questions her. He then tries to stop MTHR's main computer but she opens another hatch releasing the \"Spinosaurus\" the second time. Upon defeating the creature, Patrick tries to stop MTHR sending the dinosaurs to Earth and fights her, eventually destroying her system, which has disastrous effects on the ship, causing it to activate the self-destruct sequence. MTHR's last words are \"I just wanted to complete my mission.\"\n\nPatrick is reunited with Sonya and Caren as they try to escape the ship via an escape shuttle, but they are attacked by the \"Cebalrai\", a two-headed \"Giganotosaurus\". The beast jumps onto the platform and chases the trio down to the bottom of the platform. As Patrick runs, the Cebalrai slams its left head into him and tosses him into the wall, making him unable to reach his gun. Caren lures the creature toward her. Patrick tries to stop her, but a stomp of the Cebalrai's paw causes the platform Caren and the monster are standing on to collapse. Both Caren and the Cebalrai fall into the abyss - much to Patrick's dismay. After defeating another \"T. rex\", Patrick and Sonya are able to escape before the ship self-destructs. But the Cebalrai, being able to survive in a vacuum, was able to get on the top of the shuttle. Patrick gets on top of the shuttle himself to destroy the \"genetic freak\" in a final battle.\n\nMidway through the battle, the Cebalrai grows a third head, and Patrick is forced to use a \"Final Wasp,\" which weakens the creature and sends it flying into space.\n\n\n\"Dino Crisis 3\" entered production in mid-2000, in a production led by Hiroyuki Kobayashi, with Shinji Mikami as Executive Producer. The original proposal was for a \"human drama\" set mostly within an unspecified \"facility\" in a city under siege from rampaging time-displaced dinosaurs, with the player being able to fight the dinosaurs with AI partners, and in which decisions made by the player could change the course of the story. Capcom Production Studio 4 later moved away from the city environment, and it was instead decided the game would be set on board a space ship far into the future. Dino Crisis 3 was always intended as an Xbox-exclusive title when that console was judged to be better at rendering graphics than the PlayStation 2; Hiroyuki Kobayashi considered a PlayStation 2 port of the game to be \"impossible\" to make.\n\nThe game's HUD went through considerable development in 2002. Originally the HUD was to be positioned on the bottom-left corner of the screen, and show health and jetpack fuel stats as lines, as well as the number of WASPs available to the player. The weapons system itself was different from earlier games; players would rely on a main weapon with infinite ammunition, with the option to switch to other forms of ammunition for stronger opponents which would be limited and have to be found or bought. The WASPs were designed as a secondary weapon which would fly around the map and provide additional aid to the player during combat. Like in \"Dino Crisis 2\", more focus is given to giving players the fun of shooting dinosaurs than item conservation and avoiding them like in \"Dino Crisis\". A shop feature was created for the game where, like in \"Dino Crisis 2\" the player could purchase supplies based on points accumulated from killing dinosaurs. However, in this game the player could accumulate a finite number, requiring them to return to the shop frequently or they would receive no further points. In developing the camera, the team decided to take full advantage of the Xbox's power and make it 3D rather than using 2D pre-rendered backgrounds like \"Dino Crisis 2\" had done. In a similar manner to Studio 1's contemporaneous \"Resident Evil Outbreak\", rooms were divided into zones where a camera would follow the player, then cut to another camera when they leave the area.\n\nThe storyboard editor, Shinji Higuchi, made the decision that the main environment, the Ozymandias, would be capable of transforming, being a long-time fan of mecha. Such ideas for the setting came from science fiction films, with the Jupiter orbit setting coming from the film, \"\"Sayonara Jupiter!\"\", which Higuchi served on as a production assistant. Several designs for the ship were also made ahead of the Xbox Conference Summer 2002 and, according to producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi, a competition was held within the development team to pick the design to use for the game. Due to this fascination with mecha, 3CGI paid particular attention to making the cutscenes of Ozymandias' transformation seem more realistic, with moving parts being locked in place. The characters were also designed based on Japanese science-fiction tropes, and attention was made to the SOAR team uniforms. For example, a transformation sequence of Patrick's helmet was carefully drawn to show how it could be stored within his suit. Distinct from the space suits of the other cast members, Caren's mini-dress was designed to echo Japanese \"race queen\" idols, and Shinji Mikami had her purple tights removed to better match that concept. 3DCGI also made sure to put focus in her animations, so that her breast and dress movements would appear more realistic in cutscenes. The creatures that populate the \"Ozymandias\" are revealed in the story to be genetically-engineered human-dinosaur hybrids. As such the creature designers were free to create the creatures how they wanted; this was liberating for the designers, as the \"Dino Crisis\" and \"Dino Crisis 2\" teams had problems with making the Therapods unique. A common theme in the dinosaurs was that they would have exposed skin and could release electricity as a form of attack.\n\nAn early story proposal centred on the emergence of dinosaurs in the present day world, possibly the very time distortion \"Dino Crisis 2\" alluded to with the Noah's Ark Plan. A single image hinting to this storyline was shown by Yoshiki Okamoto when he announced three Capcom games at the May 16 Xbox announcement for E3 2001. Kobayashi moved the project away from the city proposal and to something else. With offers from the Flagship team, led by Noboru Sugimura; Hiromichi Nakamoto; Shin Yoshida and Hiroaki Kanazawa, it was agreed the game story be shifted to a futuristic environment in space which would allow for new ideas. Some fifty minutes of pre-rendered cutscenes were created for the game. Makoto Kamiya, a professional film director, was hired to direct the work so that elements such as camera angles would look movie-like.\n\n\"Dino Crisis 3\" received \"mixed\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN gave the game a 6.0, describing it as a missed-opportunity to advance the series, having been betrayed by minor, but repetitive faults. GameSpot branded the game with a \"Mediocre\" 5.4, having found the game more \"frustrating than [...] fun\" due to its flaws, though finding the game to be enjoyable if ignored.\n\nThe most common criticism was the camera system, which was named by IGN as \"The Worst Camera Ever\". The problem was due to the high speeds that the player can frequently travel at. As with the first two \"Dino Crisis\" titles and the early elements of the \"Resident Evil\" series, rooms in \"Dino Crisis 3\" are separated into separate, invisible zones where the camera is set to change once the boundary is crossed. Because of the fast-moving jetpack, players would travel between those boundaries rapidly, with multiple camera changes leading to confusion as to where the player is supposed to be going, resulting in them inadvertently turning back. Because of the large size of zones and the long-range auto-aim system, IGN expected that players would spend 80% of their game to be firing at enemies that are out of their view and dodging attacks from off-screen. GameSpot suggested that the game would be a lot more playable had the player been given the opportunity to, at the very least, move the angle of the camera. \"GamePro\" was also frustrated by the camera stylization, saying that the \"awkward\" camera stopped the game from reaching the potential it could have had.\n\nThere was some disappointment regarding the variety of the enemies: IGN counted only three non-boss enemies present in the game, but admired their unique designs, particularly for the \"simian-esque\" dinosaurs. There was more support for the boss enemies, though, with IGN citing the key to victory being to avoid attacks rather than to simply shoot. \"GamePro\" was disappointed by the enemies' entry into battles, with them literally appearing out of thin air.\n\nIGN was supportive of Capcom's decision to turn the \"Ozymandias\" into a giant puzzle, with the ship being able to routinely change formation. This puzzle method was compared to a jigsaw. IGN also admired the uniqueness of the 50+ rooms within the \"Ozymandias\", but questioned the decision to avoid such environments as a cafeteria or a mess hall, which would have made the ship feel more like it actually had a crew to begin with. GameSpot saw little 'uniqueness' in the designs, noting the same shiny metallic look of the ship's interiors being everywhere and, without using the 3D map feature, it would be hard to get lost when moving around (partly because of the camera system). The 3D map, itself, while helpful to some, was also considered to be an \"arduous process\" to use.\n\nThe voice acting was thought to be of reasonable quality, which IGN felt to be 'surprising' for a Japanese game using English-speaking actors. IGN did mention the presence of \"corny\" dialogue, though. GameSpot considered it to be a \"passable\" B-grade, in comparison. Other aspects of the sound design, such as the score and sound effects, were also found to be good or \"passable\"; they were criticised for being limited and repetitive in rooms, however.\n\nGameTrailers included the game in a \"Top Ten Worst Sequels\" feature, stating that \"[i]t's a good sign you have an abysmal sequel when its developer respectfully declines to follow it up.\"\n\n"}

Sandbrook is now visiting professor at King's College London, and a freelance writer and newspaper columnist. In 2007 he was named one of Waterstone's 25 Authors for the Future.\n\nSandbrook's first book, a biography of the American politician and presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy, proved extremely controversial on its publication in the United States in 2004. Writing for H-Net, the interdisciplinary forum for scholars in the humanities and social sciences, David Stebenne said the book \"describes McCarthy's life and work with outstanding grace and clarity\", and was \"a very fine study of a significant figure that serious students of American postwar history will want to consult.\" McCarthy himself called the book \"almost libellous\".\n\nIn 2005, Sandbrook published \"Never Had It So Good\", a history of Britain from the Suez Crisis to The Beatles, 1956–63. It was described as a \"rich treasure chest of a book\" by Anthony Howard in \"The Daily Telegraph\", who wrote of his \"respect for the sweep and scope of the author's knowledge\". Nick Cohen wrote in \"The Observer\" that it was \"a tribute to Sandbrook's literary skill that his scholarship is never oppressive. Alternately delightful and enlightening, he has produced a book which must have been an enormous labour to write but is a treat to read\".\n\nThe sequel, \"White Heat,\" covering the years 1964–70 and the rise and fall of Harold Wilson's Labour government, was published in August 2006. \"Sandbrook's book could hardly be more impressive in its scope,\" wrote Leo McKinstry in \"The Times\". \"He writes with authority and an eye for telling detail.\" In November 2009, it was named by the \"Telegraph\" as \"one of the books that defined the Noughties\".\n\nUnlike some previous historians of the 1960s, Sandbrook argues that the period was marked by strong conservatism and conformity. His books attempt to debunk what he sees as myths associated with the period, from the sexual revolution to student protest, and he challenges the \"cultural revolution\" thesis associated with historians like Arthur Marwick. Charles Shaar Murray, writing in \"The Independent\", called Sandbrook \"the Hoodie Historian\" and imagined him \"slouching into shot while throwing whatever passes for gang signs in the history department of the University of Sheffield, and announcing to Arthur Marwick, Jonathon Green et al. that 'You is all mi bitches nuh.'\"\n\nSandbrook continued the history of postwar Britain with \"State of Emergency\" (2010), covering the period 1970–1974, and \"Seasons in the Sun\", which took the story up to the election of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister in 1979. A fifth volume, \"Who Dares Wins\", covering the period 1979–1982, was published in October 2019. Anthony Quinn, reviewing for \"The Observer\", described it as a \"long, painstaking and pretty enjoyable haul through Britain in the first three years of the Thatcher government... ungratifyingly even-handed in his portrait of [Thatcher], alive to the flaws in her character and sharp in confounding the popular myths.\" For \"The Sunday Times\", Piers Brendon said it was \"a rich mixture of political narrative and social reportage... scholarly, accessible, well written, witty and incisive.\" \n\nSandbrook has written articles and reviews for the \"Daily Mail\", \"The Sunday Times\", \"The Sunday Telegraph\", \"The Observer\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\" and has appeared on BBC radio and television. His Radio Four series \"SlapDash Britain\", charting the rise and fall of British governance since the Second World War, was described by the radio critic Miranda Sawyer as \"very brilliant\".\n\nIn February 2011, Michael C. Moynihan identified several instances of apparent plagiarism in Sandbrook's book \"Mad as Hell\". Moynihan later expressed amazement that there were few repercussions for Sandbrook's career. He suggested that Sandbrook was shielded from criticism by his social connections, saying: \"There is an element of protection. Media buddies who go to the same dinner parties and all the rest of it.\" \n\nIn an interview with Brendan O'Neill, Sandbrook rejected the allegations and said \"the fact that \"Mad as Hell\" was later published in paperback without any changes 'tells its own story'.\" He maintained that he \"footnoted his sources, and if popular history books sometimes sound familiar that is because there are only so many ways to say things.\"\n\n\n"}

The CargoSprinter was designed by Windhoff GmbH (Germany) in the mid-1990s.\n\nInitially seven vehicles were built for Deutsche Bahn. Four were built by Windhoff and had the reporting code \"DB class 690\". Another three closely similar units were built by Waggonfabrik Talbot ('Talbot Talion') and given the reporting code \"DB class 691\". The design did not lead to further freight work, several of the trains were later converted for other uses including tunnel rescue trains.\n\nA variant for infrastructure and service trains, named the \"Multi Purpose Vehicle\" has been sold to a number of countries, mainly for use by rail infrastructure companies, including the United Kingdom (Railtrack; track maintenance and specialised overhead electrification train), Switzerland (specialised tunnel rescue and firefighting version), and the Netherlands and Taiwan (maintenance of high speed lines).\n\nThe CargoSprinter was developed in 1996 by Windhoff in association with freight operators DB Cargo and Fraport. The concept was for a self powered container carrying freight train, with a relatively high top speed enabling it to operate without disrupting passenger services.\n\nThe new concept was optimistically received as offering a step change in rail freight transportation, allowing rapid efficient transport of less than trainload and shortline freight, 7 vehicles were initially built (1997) for trials with Deutsche Bahn. In practice the CargoSprinter concept was not a success as a commercial freight vehicle, trials of the vehicles did not lead to regular work. Ex-freight trial vehicles later found use modified for specialised roles, such as tunnel rescue, and hybrid powered freight trains.\n\nThe design was more successful as an infrastructure and services train: in 1998 Windhoff received a 57DM million order from Railtrack (UK) for 25 trains derived from the CargoSprinter type, named \"Multi-purpose vehicles\" (MPVs), developed in association with AMEC Rail; the trains were to be used for infrastructure maintenance including rail deicing, and railhead treatment, 7 more sets were acquired in 2000.\n\nIn 2002 the CargoSprinter train was used as the mechanical basis of the \"CargoMover\" automated freight wagon concept developed by Siemens.\n\nOther specialised designs based on the Windhoff MPV include a dedicated fire fighting and tunnel rescue trains (Switzerland; 2003, Austria; 2004), and railway overhead electrification factory trains for both wire renewal, and overhead line construction. (UK; 2000, 2011)\n\nMPV vehicles are also in use by rail infrastructure companies in Taiwan (2007–)., and the Netherlands (2007–).\n\nThree units were constructed by Windhoff, and four by Talbot, with the first unit operational in 1997; both were broadly similar in design with the same operating characteristics, the Talbot built vehicles (branded \"Talion\") differed in having inner unpowered wagons articulated using jacobs bogies.\n\nThe CargoSprinter trains operated between the intermodal rail terminal \"Rail AirCargo Station\" at Frankfurt Airport, Hamburg, Osnabrück, and Hanover and between 1997 and 1999, carrying two trains per day: the equivalent of 5000 lorry loads per year. The service was initially successful with high reliability and full utilisation; work on the connecting railway line in the second year of operation disrupted the service, causing loss of custom leading to the termination of the service.\n\nFrom 2000 the units were out of service, one was used for the Siemens' CargoMover experimental freight vehicle which was displayed at Innotrans in 2002. The remaining vehicles were offered for sale in 2004, and acquired for use in Austria as tunnel rescue trains.\n\nBoth variants of the design (DB 690 'CargoSprinter' and DB 691 'Talion') are five-car trains, with a control cabin at either end. The end cars are powered, with the inner axles individually driven by Volvo engines (6 cylinder, 265 kW @ 2050 rpm, emissions to Euro stage II standards). The transmission system uses a (5-speed) mechanical gearbox with clutch, torque converter, and retarder. Fuel capacity is 700l. All the traction equipment is located below the cargo floor level.\n\nThe vehicles main frames are constructed from welded steel; there are two longitudinal support beams and several transverse members (example: Windhoff intermediate cars). The driving vehicle bogies have rubber primary suspension. The Windhoff unpowered vehicles use leaf spring primary suspension. the Talbot vehicles use rubber. All train axles have disc brakes. The vehicles are within the EBO G2 structure gauge.\n\nThe end cabs have airconditioning, and are heated using waste heat from the diesel engine cooling system; the cabins are isolated from frame vibrations by an air-suspension system. The cab control systems use electronic multifunction display, and joystick control. The trains are permanently coupled whilst in service, and can work in multiple forming consists of up to 630m (7 trains, 35 cars) – the inter-trainset coupling is via a Z-AK type automatic coupler, which includes electrical connections for power and data.\n\nBoth Windhoff and Talbot trains are operationally compatible; differences between the versions include the electronic control systems, minor differences in dimension, and the wheel arrangement. The three intermediate unpowered vehicles in the Windhoff CargoSprinter are two axle wagons, the Talbot intermediate unpowered cars use two axle jacobs articulation between the wagons, and two axle bogies on the end wagons.\n\nUnused ex-DB 690 and DB 691 units were sold to the Austrian Federal Railways in 2004, and converted to tunnel rescue trains (ÖBB X690).\nCRT Group order CargoSprinter in 2001, and introduced the first CargoSprinter to Australia in 2002. The Australian CargoSprinters have similar technical characteristics as the original versions built for Deutsche Bahn: Push-pull operation, with 2 Volvo EU Tier II engines with 5 speed transmissions per powered end unit; a cargo capacity of 2 TEU per vehicle; all wheels disc braked; air suspended cabin with air conditioning; and the ability to work in multiple train-units; and a top speed of 120 km/h.\n\nWhilst CRT was acquired by Queensland Rail the CargoSprinter was retained as part of a private company by CRT director Colin Rees. In 2004 Colin Rees announced that a more powerful version of the design was being developed, with double the capacity.\n\nIn 2000 independent Dutch railway company Shortlines announced that it had placed a 5DM million order for CargoSprinter trains with Windoff, to operate a freight train for Philips between Eindhoven and Rotterdam. The use of CargoSprinters was cancelled due to time and cost issues relating to installing ATB safety system on the trains.\n\nIn 2007 Windhoff acquired a contract to supply two MPV vehicles were supplied to Infraspeed for infrastructure work on the HSL Zuid in the Netherlands. The design is powered by engines, and has a top speed of .\n\nJernbaneverket ordered 11 track and catenary maintenance vehicles in 2014, for delivery from 2016.\n\nA fire-fighting train, the LRZ NT (\"Lösch- und Rettungszug Neue Technologie\") was developed by Windhoff and partners (2003) for Swiss rail operators Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon (BLS) and Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS) for initial use on the Lötschberg Base Tunnel. Windhoff supplied the basic train technology, derived from their MPV design. SBB acquired a three vehicle two engined train, whilst BLS acquired a four-vehicle, three-engined train (both with one unpowered vehicle). The SBB trains comprise one fire fighting vehicle, one non-powered vehicle with the water/foam supply and breathable air supply, and a rescue vehicle with space for 60 people. The BLS train has an additional rescue vehicle. Both versions are powered by MTU 6H1800 R80 type engines of power.\n\nIn 2009 an ex-DB CargoSprinter (DB 691-502) machine was used as part of a new train design, named \"RailXpress\" – the design used a remote control modified CargoSprinter control car at one end as a control car and for shunting on non-electrified lines. At the other end of the train an electric locomotive (such as SBB Re 420) was used for mainline work, operating trains of at up to .\n\nIn 2012 SBB ordered 2 additional LRZs for the Gotthard Base Tunnel from a Windhoff / Dräger consortium.\n\nIn 2015 SBB ordered 35 track maintenance vehicles for delivery from 2017 to 2021.\n\nIn 2016 SBB ordered 3 additional LRZs from a Windhoff / Dräger consortium, for the CEVA line, Ceneri Base Tunnel, and the Lötschberg and Simplon Tunnels.\n\nIn 2007/8 Windhoff manufactured and supplied six MPV derived trains for infrastructure maintenance work on the Taiwan High Speed Rail line.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, infrastructure operator Railtrack ordered 25 two-car units in 1998. The first 25 trainsets had only one driving car powered. An additional order for 7 more trainsets was placed in 2000 – these units had both end cars powered giving a top speed of . The vehicles are used for weedkilling, de-icing, and water-jetting and sandite treatment of the railhead.\n\nThe MPV vehicles have also been proposed for use in revenue earning freight train services; ISO container transportation using a MPV power cars and conventional container wagons was experimentally trialled in 2000; containers were transported from the Port of Southampton to terminals in Birmingham and Barking. and technically successful trials with a two MPV power cars and 7 OTA two-axle timber wagons were carried out in 2005.\n\nTwo factory train for renewing overhead line equipment on the West Coast Mainline was ordered in 1999, and delivered in 2000. Each train-consist was made up of five separable autonomous units (four of which were single-ended MPVs); the entire train is fitted for multiple working allowing self powered transportation to a work site. In operation the train-consist splits into five sub-trains: the first unit is used to dismantle and recover previously installed wire; the second unit replaces catenary support wires (\"droppers\"), the third and fourth units install new wire and droppers, and the fifth unit is used for quality control – measuring and recording the new installation. To allow slow speed control the MPVs were fitted with hydrostatic drives. A Windhoff MPV was also used as the basis of a piling train – used to install catenary masts. The piling train including MPV mounted piling hammers (Fambo AB), and installation cranes (Hap, Palfinger).\n\nIn 2011 a specialised factory train for overhead line installation was ordered – the initial use of the train was expected to be the electrification of the Great Western Main Line (c.2013). The train, named the 'High Output Plant System' train was completed by late 2013. The entire train consisted of a 500m 23 vehicles designed to be split into five separate working sections: two piling sets, one with a vibrating piler, the other with a percussion piler; a concrete mixing set; a structure erection set; and a catenary installation set.\n\nIn 2016, NI Railways had an MPV delivered to undertake sandite duties.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2253446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253446", "title": "Coking", "text": "Coking\n\nCoking is the heating of coal in the absence of oxygen to a temperature above 600 °C, to drive off the volatile components of the raw coal, leaving a hard, strong, porous material of high carbon content, called coke. Coke consists almost entirely of hydrocarbons. The porosity gives it a high surface area, which makes it burn faster (as does a sheet of paper versus a wooden log). When a kilogram of coke is burned it releases more heat than a kilogram of the original coal.\n\nCoke is used as fuel in a blast furnace. In a continuous process, coke, iron ore, and limestone are mixed together, and placed in the top of the blast furnace, and at the bottom liquid iron, and waste slag, are removed. The raw materials continuously move down the blast furnace. During this continuous process more raw materials are placed at the top, and the coke must withstand the ever-increasing weight of the raw materials above it. It is the ability to withstand this crushing force, in addition to its high energy content and rapid combustion, that makes coke ideal for use in blast furnaces.\n\n“Coking is a refinery unit operation that upgrades material called bottoms from the atmospheric or vacuum distillation column into higher-value products and produces petroleum coke—a coal-like material.”. In heterogeneous catalysis, the process is undesirable because the clinker blocks the catalytic sites. Coking is characteristic of high temperature reactions involving hydrocarbons feedstocks. Typically coking is reversed by combustion, provided that the catalyst will tolerate such.\n\nA simplified equation for coking is shown in the case of ethylene:\nA more realistic but complex view involves the alkylation of an aromatic ring of a coke nucleus. Acidic catalysts are thus especially prone to coking because they are effective at generating carbocations (i.e., alkylating agents).\n\nCoking is one of several mechanisms for the deactivation of a heterogeneous catalyst. Other mechanisms include sintering, poisoning, and solid-state transformation of the catalyst.\n"}
{"id": "2253457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253457", "title": "Federal Foreign Office", "text": "Federal Foreign Office\n\nThe Federal Foreign Office (German: ), abbreviated AA, is the foreign ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany, a federal agency responsible for both the country's foreign policy and its relationship with the European Union. It is a cabinet-level ministry. Since March 2018, Heiko Maas has served as Foreign Minister, succeeding Sigmar Gabriel. The primary seat of the ministry is at the \"\" square in the Mitte district, the historic centre of Berlin.\n\nThe term Auswärtiges Amt was the name of the Foreign Office established in 1870 by the North German Confederation, which then became the German Empire's Foreign Office in 1871. It is still the name of the German foreign ministry today. From 1871 to 1919, the Foreign Office was led by a Foreign Secretary, and since 1919, it has been led by the Foreign Minister of Germany.\n\nThe \"Auswärtiges Amt\" was established in 1870 to form the foreign policy of the North German Confederation, and from 1871 of the German Empire. The Foreign Office was originally led by a secretary of state (therefore not called a ministry), while the Chancellor, who usually also held the office of Prussian Minister of Foreign Affairs, remained in charge of foreign affairs.\n\nIn the first years of the German nation-state under Otto von Bismarck, the Foreign Office on Wilhelmstrasse No. 76 next to the Reich Chancellery had two departments: one for political affairs and the other for economic, legal and consular matters. After Bismarck's dismissal in 1890, another department for colonial policy was established, spun off as the separate \"Reichskolonialamt\" in 1907. Bismarck in order to maintain his control of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" appointed his son Herbert von Bismarck as State Secretary. That Bismarck appointed his son as State Secretary reflected his determination to be his own foreign minister, and his need for an utterly loyal man to run the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" when he was not around. Bismarck would not accept opinions contrary to his own, and only those diplomats who were devoted to him rose to high rank. Bismarck greatly valued accurate information, and as such diplomats tended to report what they believed to be the truth back to Berlin.\n\nRight from the start, the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" was very socially exclusive. To join, one needed a university degree, preferably in jurisprudence and needed to prove that one had a considerable private income. In 1880, a candidate had to prove that he had a private income of at least 6,000 marks/annum in order to join; by 1900, the requirement was 10,000 marks/annum and by 1912, a candidate needed at least 15,000 marks/annum to join. This requirement explains why so many German diplomats married richer women because without the wealth of their wives they would never had been able to join the \"Auswärtiges Amt\".\n\nThe income requirement to enter the AA was only dropped in 1918. Aristocrats were very much overrepresented in the \"Auswärtiges Amt\". During the Imperial period, 69% of the 548 men who served in the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" were noblemen, and every single ambassador during the Second Reich was an aristocrat. The most important department by far was the Political Department which between 1871-1918 was 61% aristocratic; middle-class men tended to serve in the less important Legal, Trade and Colonial Departments. In the 19th century, it was believed that only aristocrats had the proper social standing and graces to correctly represent the \"Reich\" abroad as ambassadors, which explains why no commoner was ever appointed ambassador during the Imperial era.\n\nAdditionally, during the entire duration of the \"old\" \"Auswärtiges Amt\" from 1871 to 1945, Roman Catholics were underrepresented in the \"Auswärtiges Amt\", comprising between 15–20% of the AA's personnel. The \"Auswärtiges Amt\" was largely a Protestant institution with Protestant candidates favored over Catholic candidates when it came to recruitment. Even more underrepresented were the Jews. During the Imperial period from 1871 to 1918, the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" had only three Jewish members, plus four Jews who had converted to Lutheranism in order to improve their career prospects. If Jews were not formally excluded, Jewish candidates were rarely accepted because of a climate of snobbish anti-Semitism, where Jews were considered to be too pushy, vulgar and lacking in social graces to be diplomats. There were also meritocratic elements within the AA. Besides for the income requirement, to enter the AA during the Imperial period, only candidates with the best grades at university and who knew two foreign languages were considered, and to join one had to pass what was widely considered to be one of the toughest diplomatic entrance exams in the world.\n\nThe reign of Emperor Wilhelm II was from 1888 to 1918.\n\nIn the years preceding World War I, the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" was responsible for the country's foreign policy under Emperor Wilhelm II, and played a key role in the \"Reich\"'s pursuit of \"Weltpolitik\" (World Politics), under which Germany sought to become the world's dominant power.\n\nThe \"Auswärtiges Amt\" was split into three factions competing against one another, namely one faction of men loyal to Bismarck, another faction loyal to Friedrich von Holstein, and yet another faction led by Prince Philip von Eulenburg and Prince Bernhard von Bülow, who would later become chancellor. This constant plotting and scheming between these factions weakened the execution of German foreign policy. As a whole, the Wilhelmstrasse was never entirely in charge of foreign policy under the Second Reich, but was instead just one out of several agencies, albeit a very important one that made and executed foreign policy.\n\nIn the years 1904-07, the \"Reich\" attempted to form an alliance with the United States on the basis of the supposedly shared fear of the \"Yellow Peril\" with Wilhelm writing to the American President Theodore Roosevelt a series of letters telling him that Germany and the United States must join forces to stop the \"yellow peril\", especially Japan from conquering the world. It took the diplomats a long time to tell Wilhelm that Roosevelt was a Japanophile who was not impressed with Wilhelm's call for an alliance based on anti-Asian racism.\n\nA nation with whom the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" was much concerned during the Imperial period was the Ottoman empire, especially during the Armenian genocide. In 1915, the German ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Baron Hans von Wangenheim told the American ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Henry Morgenthau Sr.: \"I do not blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians...They are entirely justified\". On September 28, 1915 Count Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, the ambassador in Washington, D.C. stated to American journalists that reports of a systematic campaign of extermination against the Armenian minority in the Ottoman empire were all \"pure inventions\", that these reports were all the work of British propaganda and no such campaign of extermination was taking place. Wangenheim's successor as ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Count Paul Wolff Metternich, was appalled by the Armenian genocide, and unlike Wangenheim, who did not really care about the Armenians, Metternich was prepared to speak out against the genocide. In August 1916, the triumvirate known as the Three Pashas which ruled the Ottoman empire, informed the German government that if Count Metternich was not recalled, he would be declared \"persona non grata\". Metternich was promptly recalled from Constantinople rather risk a public relations disaster which potentially could damage German-Ottoman relations in the middle of the war. As the Ottoman empire today would be considered a third world country with almost no modern industry, the Ottoman government was entirely dependent upon weapons from Germany to fight World War I, giving the \"Reich\" a powerful form of leverage to apply against the Ottomans on behalf of the Armenians if only the political will in Berlin had been present. In a 2015 speech, the German president Joachim Gauck apologized for his country's inaction, stating that those diplomats who protested against the Armenian genocide were \"ignored\" by the leadership of \"Auswärtiges Amt\", who valued good relations with the Ottoman empire more than they did the lives of the Armenians.\n\nIn 1919, the Foreign Office was reorganised as the \"Auswärtige Amt\" and a modern structure was established. It was now under the authority of a foreign minister, though still called \"Amt\" for traditional reasons. In 1922, the Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau was assassinated because he was a Jew. The most notable head of the Foreign Office during the Weimar Republic was Gustav Stresemann, foreign minister from 1923 to 1929, who strived for a reconciliation with the French Third Republic, which earned him—together with Aristide Briand—the 1926 Nobel Peace Prize. In an important sign of changed emphasis within the \"Auswärtiges Amt\", in July 1930 , the State Secretary (the number #2 man in the \"Auswärtiges Amt\") and Stresemann's right-hand man was fired and replaced with the \"crudely nationalist\" Prince (who is not to be confused with his uncle, Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow). The replacement of Schubert with Bülow marked the ascendency of the more nationalistic fraction within the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" who favored a more confrontational foreign policy with regards to France. In May 1932 Baron Konstantin von Neurath was appointed foreign minister in the \"Cabinet of the President's Friends\" headed by Franz von Papen. Neurath continued on as Foreign Minister under the governments of General Kurt von Schleicher and Adolf Hitler. During the Nazi period, Neurath found himself exposed to increasing competition from Nazi politicians like Alfred Rosenberg and Joachim von Ribbentrop. In February 1938, Hitler fired Neurath and replaced him with Ribbentrop.\n\nIn 1933, the vast majority of the diplomats serving in the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" came from upper-class families with a disproportionate number coming from the aristocracy. The overrepresentation of aristocrats together with its overwhelming upper-class character gave the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" an elitist cachet, and made the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" into one of the most prestigious institutions in Germany. Because of its upper-class composition, the diplomats could afford extremely expensive clothes, and the men of \"Auswärtiges Amt\" were generally considered to the best dressed officials in the entire German government, contributing to the \"Auswärtiges Amt\"'s glamorous, stylist image. There were no female diplomats, and besides for the women employed as secretaries, clerks and cleaners, the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" had no female employees. That the men of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" formed an elitist group can be seen that every single diplomat had a university degree (before the 1950s, most Germans did not go to university). The requirement that one had to have a university degree to enter the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" effectively guaranteed upper-class dominance of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\".\n\nAll of the senior diplomats in the 1930s were veterans of the struggle to win Germany \"world power status\" in the first years of the 20th century. Hitler's goal of making Germany into the world's greatest power was thus a foreign policy goal that the diplomats embraced quite headily. The German historian Eckart Conze stated about the overlap in viewpoints between the diplomats and the Nazis :\"...the top diplomats in the Weimar Republic were opposed to a liberal political order and parliamentarianism. And then the Nazis built political and ideological bridges for them. They announced their intention to reverse the Treaty of Versailles and make the German \"Reich\" into a world power. The majority of the diplomats were able to sign their names on to such a program.\" In March 1933, Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Prittwitz und Gaffron, the Ambassador to the United States resigned on the grounds that he could not in good conscience serve the Nazi government; he was the only member of the entire \"Auswärtiges Amt\" who resigned in protest at the Nazi regime.\n\nOfficially, the men of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" were supposed to be non-political, but in practice the diplomats formed a \"quite exclusive group\" with extremely conservative views and values. For these men, unconditional loyalty to the state was the highest possible value, and though the majority of the diplomats were not ideological National Socialists, they served the Nazi regime loyally until the very end. The dominance of the traditional \"insiders\" at the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" can be seen that every State Secretary during the Nazi era was a professional diplomat. The State Secretaries of the Third Reich were Prince Bernhard von Bülow (State Secretary 1930-36), Count Hans Georg von Mackensen (State Secretary 1936-38 and ambassador to Italy 1938-42), Baron Ernst von Weizsäcker (State Secretary 1938-43 and ambassador to the Holy See 1943-45) and Baron Gustav Adolf Steengracht von Moyland (State Secretary 1943-45). The overlap in goals between the professional diplomats and the Nazis were well illustrated by the memo on what should be the foreign policy of the Hitler government written by Bülow in March 1933 calling for Germany to recover the borders of 1914 and all of the lost colonies, annexation of Austria, and German domination of Eastern Europe.\n\nDuring the Neurath years (1932-1938), there were very few \"outsiders\" allowed into the \"Auswärtiges Amt\". Aside from Ribbentrop, who served as variously as Commissioner of Disarmament (1934–35), Extraordinary Ambassador-at-Large (1935–36), and Ambassador to Great Britain (1936–38), the most notable of the \"outsiders\" were Franz von Papen (Ambassador to Austria 1934-38 and to Turkey 1939-44), Hans Luther (Ambassador to the United States 1933-37), Colonel Hermann Kriebel (Consul in Shanghai 1934-39), and General Wilhelm Faupel (Ambassador to Spain 1936-37). Most diplomats were not believers in National Socialism, but during the Third Reich, many diplomats such as Neurath himself joined the NSDAP and/or the SS as an opportunistic way of improving their career prospects; such self-interested careerism was rampant amongst the German civil service in the Nazi period. Those diplomats involved in the attempts to overthrow Hitler such as Count Ulrich von Hassell, Adam von Trott zu Solz, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, Richard Kuenzer, Hans Bernd von Haeften, and Edmund Brücklmeir comprised a small minority of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\". The German historian wrote that for those diplomats who chose to become involved in \"Widerstand\", given that they were steeped in Prussian traditions where loyalty to the state was the highest virtue, it required \"extraordinary strength of character\" for them to go against everything that they had been taught to believe in.\n\nAfter Germany's defeat in May 1945, the country was occupied and the German state was abolished by the Allies. The country was administered as four zones controlled respectively by the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. In August 1949, a German government was reestablished in the western zones, the Federal Republic of Germany, which in its first years had very limited powers. In October 1949, the German Democratic Republic was founded in what had been the Soviet zone. Whereas Georg Dertinger had already been appointed the first minister of foreign affairs of East Germany in 1949, due to the Allied occupation statute the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" of West Germany was not reestablished until March 15, 1951.\n\nChancellor Konrad Adenauer took office as the first Foreign Minister in Bonn until he was succeeded by Heinrich von Brentano in 1955. By and large, the men who had served in the new \"Auswärtiges Amt\" were the same men who had served in the old \"Auswärtiges Amt\". In a \"Bundestag\" debate on 23 October 1952, Adenauer admitted that 66% of the diplomats of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" had belonged to the NSDAP, but justified their employment as: \"I could not build up a Foreign Office without relying upon such skilled men\". Upon Willy Brandt's taking office as Foreign Minister in the Grand coalition under Kurt Georg Kiesinger starting in 1966, the office was usually connected with the position of the Vice-Chancellor. From 1974 until 1992—with a short pause in 1982—Hans-Dietrich Genscher served as Foreign Minister and continued to champion Brandt's \"Ostpolitik\" while also playing a crucial role in the preparation of German reunification.\n\nIn 2000 the Foreign Office returned to Berlin where it took up quarters in the former Reichsbank building, which from 1959 to 1990 had served as the seat of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and was enlarged by a newly built annex. The former ministry in Bonn was retained as a secondary seat. The Foreign Office has always stressed its continuity and traditions going back to 1870.\n\nA report entitled \"The Ministry and the Past\" written by historians and released by the German government in October 2010 shows that wartime-era diplomats played an important role in assisting the Nazis in carrying out the Holocaust, and disproved the claim often made after 1945 that German diplomats were \"sand in the machine\" who acted to moderate the actions of the Nazi regime.\n\nIn 2003, the French historian Lucas Delattre published a biography of Fritz Kolbe, a mid-ranking diplomat who become a spy for the American Office of Strategic Services because he believed his country deserved to lose the war on the account of the genocide it was waging against the Jews. Delattre stated that Kolbe really was a case of a diplomat being \"sand in the machine\" as Kolbe provided intelligence to help his country lose the war, but added sarcastically that if every German civil servant really were \"sand in the machine\" as almost all of them claimed to be after 1945 that Hitler would never had managed to get anything done. Diplomats like Kolbe were very much the exception, not the rule.\n\nIn addition to the ministry's headquarters in Berlin, Germany has established embassies and consulates around the world.\n\n\n\n"}

The airline operates scheduled services between the islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon-Langlade and to Canada. Its main base is Saint-Pierre Airport, from which it serves six destinations. In addition to the collectivity's other airport, Miquelon Airport, it serves five airports in Canada. The airline operates a fleet of an ATR 42 for international services and a Reims-Cessna F406 on the inter-island service.\n\nThe airline was founded in 1964 and originally flew in cooperation with Eastern Provincial Airways. The first aircraft was a Piper Aztec, which was put into service to a service to Sydney, Nova Scotia. During the 1970s the airline variously took into use Beechcraft Model 18 and Hawker Siddeley HS 748. Flights to Miquelon were introduced in 1979 and to Montreal two years later. A Piper Chieftain was bought in that year. ATR 42s were introduced in 1994 and services Moncton, New Brunswick and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador were introduced in the following years.\n\nThe airline was incorporated on 6 March 1964, founded by Albert Briand. Services commenced in June with a cooperation with Eastern Provincial Airways, allowing codesharing with EPA's Douglas DC-3 between Saint-Pierre and Sydney. However, the codesharing was terminated in October. Air Saint-Pierre thereafter started conducting charter flights with a Piper Aztec. A second unit was procured in 1966, the same year as the founder died. The airline continued its cooperation with EPA, including hiring the latter for maintenance.\n\nThe Saint-Pierre to Sydney route resumed under operation of Air Saint-Pierre in 1971. At first they flew using a Beechcraft Model 18, and three years later this was increased to flights using a DC-3. In 1976 the DC-3 was sold and replaced with a Hawker Siddeley HS 748. Miquelon Airport opened in 1979, allowing Air Saint-Pierre to commence an inter-island service to the larger island of Miquelon-Langlade. The same year the pooling between EPA and Air Saint-Pierre resumed on the Saint-Pierre to Sydney route.\nA Piper Chieftain was bought in 1981 and a maintenance contract with signed with Fundy Aviation. In 1986 the HS 748 was with a new of the same model and maintenance of the fleet moved to the island the following year. This coincided with the opening of a route from Saint-Pierre to Montreal. The fleet was increased in 1990 with the procurement of a second HS 748.\n\nAn ATR 42-320 was bought in 1994 and the following year the two Hawker Siddeley's were sold. The airline opened a service to St. John's with three weekly round trips. Moncton was added as a destination in 2001, with a weekly summer service. The airline bought its Reims-Cessna F406 in 2003 and put into service on the inter-island route. It was chosen in part for its short-run performance. This allowed the Chieftain to be decommissioned the following year. The initial ATR was sold in 2009 and replaced on 21 October with a newer and more modern ATR 42-500.\n\nAir Saint-Pierre is based at Saint-Pierre Airport in the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.

None of the area in play of the golf course is actually located in Oakmont. Established in 1903, its golf course is regarded as the \"oldest top-ranked golf course in the United States.\" It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The Pennsylvania Turnpike separates seven holes (2–8) from the rest of the course.\n\nThe course, the only design by Henry Fownes, opened in 1903. With a crew of 150 men and a little under two dozen mule teams, Henry Fownes spent a year building Oakmont on old farmland, which was ideal for a links-style course. It straddles the Allegheny River Valley and uniquely has virtually no water hazards, and, since 2007, almost no trees. With a USGA course rating of 77.5 and some two hundred bunkers it is generally regarded in the golf community as one of the most difficult in the United States. It features large, extremely fast, and undulating greens. All are original but the 8th, which was moved several yards to the left to make way for the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the late 1940s. Originally a links course, trees were added in the 1950s-1960s. Most were removed beginning after the 1994 U.S. Open, with between 5,000 and 8,000 eliminated during a 2007 renovation alone. Greens are planted with Poa annua, and par for members is 71.\n\nThe course is also noted for its slope. In particular, on holes 1, 3, 10, and 12, the greens pitch away from the fairway.\n\nOne of Oakmont's most famous hazards is the Church Pews bunker that comes into play on the 3rd and 4th holes. It measures approximately and features twelve grass covered traversing ridges that resemble church pews.\n\nFor many years, Oakmont's bunkers were groomed with a rake with wider than normal tines, creating deep furrows. The rakes were last used in U.S. Open competition in 1962 and eliminated from the club in 1964.\n\nThe course has been consistently ranked as one of the five best by \"Golf Digest\" 100 Greatest Golf Courses in America. In 2007 Oakmont was placed in 5th by the magazine. It is one of only a few courses ranked every year in the top ten of the publication's history. The top 50 toughest courses ranks Oakmont also at number 5, while GolfLink.com ranks it at #3 overall.\n\n<br>\nA hole-by-hole course map from GOLF magazine (June 2007) can be viewed here \nFlyovers of the holes can be seen here \n\nOakmont has hosted the U.S. Open nine times, more than any other course, most recently in 2016, and is scheduled for its tenth in 2025. It has also hosted three PGA Championships, five U.S. Amateurs, three NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships, and two U.S. Women's Opens. In total championships hosted (21), it also far outranks any other course.\n\nPhoto galleries of the U.S. Opens at Oakmont from the USGA's official site can be seen here \n\nThe first U.S. Open at Oakmont was won by Tommy Armour, who defeated Harry Cooper in an 18-hole Friday playoff. Their 72-hole score was 301 (+13); the par-72 course played to in 1927 (the first and ninth holes were both par 5). The average score for the field was 78.6 (+ 6.6) and the field recorded just 2 rounds under par. The total purse of prize money was $800 ($ in dollars).\n\nWon by Sam Parks, Jr. at 11 strokes over par. The par 72 course played to in 1935 and the average score for the field was 80.55 (+ 8.55) and the field recorded 3 rounds under par. The total purse of prize money was $5,000 ($ in dollars) with a winner's share of $1,000 ($ in dollars).\n\nBen Hogan won the second of his three straight majors in 1953 at Oakmont by six strokes, coming in at five under par.\n\nScheduling conflicts made it impossible to win all four majors that year, as the late rounds of the PGA Championship, then a match play event, and the mandatory 36-hole qualifier directly preceding the British Open overlapped in early July. Hogan won The Masters by five strokes and the British Open at Carnoustie by four strokes. The par-72 Oakmont course played at in 1953 and the average score for the field was 77.12 (+ 5.12); the field recorded 20 rounds under par. The purse was $14,900 and the champion earned $5,000 ($ and $ in dollars).\n\nAt the 1962 U.S. Open, an up-and-coming 22-year-old named Jack Nicklaus defeated the world's top player at the time, the 33-year-old Arnold Palmer, in a Sunday playoff round in Palmer's \"backyard\".\n\nBoth competitors had completed the 72 holes with a 283 (–1). It was the first professional victory for Nicklaus, and the first of his 18 professional majors. Palmer won the next major, the 1962 British Open, and his fourth Masters in 1964, but never another U.S. Open. In 1962, par was reduced by a stroke to 71 (the first hole became a par-4) and the course length was slightly reduced to ; the average score for the field was 75.86 (+ 4.86) and the field recorded 19 rounds under par. The purse was $81,600 and the champion earned $17,500 ($ and $ in dollars).\n\nJohnny Miller shot a final round 63 (–8) to set a record low score at a U.S. Open, and finished at 279 (–5) to win by one stroke in 1973.\n\nFollowing an overnight rainstorm, Miller entered the final round in 12th place at three-over, six strokes behind the four co-leaders. Miller had carded a disappointing five-over 76 on Saturday, and his tee time on Sunday was about an hour ahead of the final pairing, which included Arnold Palmer.\n\nMiller birdied the first four holes and hit all 18 greens in regulation, and used only 29 putts. Miller and four others were the only ones to break par during the final round in 1973. The par 71 course played at and the average score for the field was 75.45 (+ 4.45) and the field recorded 40 rounds under par. The purse was $219,400 and the champion earned $35,000 ($ and $ in dollars).\n\nMiller's low score (9 birdies with 1 bogey) led the USGA to set up the course at the following year's championship, now known as \"The Massacre at Winged Foot,\" in an extremely challenging manner; Hale Irwin's winning score in 1974 was seven strokes over par.\n\nClub selection and results - June 17, 1973\nIn 1983, Larry Nelson was at 148 (+6) after the first two rounds. He then established the 36-hole record at the U.S. Open when he finished 65-67 to finish at 280 (–4), one stroke ahead of runner-up and defending champion Tom Watson. Nelson's two-round total of 132 (–10) broke the 51-year-old record by four shots, established by Gene Sarazen in 1932. Nelson's record, although not receiving level acclaim to Miller's 63 finish, stood until 2011 when it was broken by Rory McIlroy. The par 71 course played at in 1983 and the average score for the field was 76.13 (+ 5.13) and the field recorded 27 rounds under par. The purse was $506,184 and the champion earned $72,000 ($ and $ in dollars).\n\nIn 1994, a 24-year-old Ernie Els outlasted Loren Roberts and Colin Montgomerie in another Monday playoff round to capture the U.S. Open, his first major and first victory in the U.S. It was the first three-way playoff at the U.S. Open since 1963.\n\nThe three in the playoff completed the four rounds at 279 (–5), but all were well over par early in the playoff round, played in oppressive heat and humidity, as temperatures approached . Montgomerie shot a 42 on the front nine, ending at 78 (+7) and was eliminated, but Els and Roberts were tied at 3-over 74, with Roberts missing a short putt on the 18th hole to win outright, so they kept playing as a sudden-death playoff. On the second extra hole, Roberts bogeyed and Els made a par to win the championship. The par 71 course played at in 1994 and the average score for the field was 74.25 (+ 3.25); the field recorded 62 rounds under par. The purse was $1.75 million and the champion earned $320,000 ($ and $ in dollars).\n\nÁngel Cabrera of Argentina shot 285 (+5) in 2007, one stroke ahead of runners-up Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk.\n\nA course renovation had deepened the bunkers and removed over 4,000 trees that had been planted mostly in the 1960s, returning the course to its original links style appearance. The course was lengthened to and par was reduced by a stroke to 70, as the uphill 9th hole became a par-4. The par-3 8th hole played at in Round 4, the par-5 12th hole at over , and the par-4 15th at . The average score for the field in 2007 was 75.72 (+ 5.72), with every hole averaging an over-par score. The field recorded just 8 rounds under par, only two per round. Cabrera had two of these sub-par rounds, shooting a 69 (-1) on Thursday and Sunday.\n\nThe weather was much more agreeable than in 1994: the high temperatures were for the first three rounds and for the final round, and there were no weather delays in any of the rounds. The total purse was $7.0 million and the champion earned $1.26 million ($ and $ in dollars).\n\nThe club hosted the U.S. Open for a record ninth time in 2016, and Dustin Johnson shot 276 (–4) to win his first major title by three strokes.\n\nOakmont is scheduled to host its tenth U.S. Open in 2025, as announced by the USGA in June 2016.\n\nOn Oakmont's greens:\n\nThe stimpmeter, a device for measuring the speed of greens, was developed by Edward Stimpson (1904–1985), an accomplished amateur player from Massachusetts, shortly after attending the 1935 U.S. Open at Oakmont.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2253466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253466", "title": "Urban Sax", "text": "Urban Sax\n\nUrban Sax is an ensemble founded by the French composer made up of massive numbers of saxophones, accompanied by percussion and sometimes voices. The group is directed by Artman and performs his compositions, which are generally repetitive and minimalist, often sounding somewhat mechanistic rather than conventionally expressive.\n\nThe group was formed in 1973, when Artman organized a concert by a group of eight saxophonists he had produced at a classical music festival in Menton, in the south of France. In subsequent years, the number of players grew to 12, 16, 20, 24, and 30, and by the early 21st century, the group consisted of 52 musicians (with saxophones ranging from the soprano to bass registers). Artman frequently integrates local musicians and dancers into his performances, and thus the ensemble can encompass as many as 200 performers.\n\nUrban Sax has performed throughout Europe, in Asia and at Expo 86 in Vancouver. The group's performances are performance art happenings; players wear metallic space suit-like costumes together with gas masks, and each performance is a unique ritualistic event that is planned for the particular architectural or natural space where it is to take place.\n\nThis project is built around the principle of spatial architecture and sound, and gathering saxophone (mobile devices) for a constant sound. The concept was initiated in a cradle of protean creation, with a strong notion of « in situ ».\nMovement and the movement of sound and its perception by the public or the audience is at the origin of the creation of the group. Saxophone then exists as an extension of the musician, and it becomes a resilient musical choreography.\n\nThe original musical principle is \"continuous sound\", around which build and develop poly-rhythmic loops, modulated and nested in a partition and a principle of \"distant sound\" allowing to question the listening audience. It is about linking audio and visual performances. The music is semi repetitive, with evolving pieces of different colors. Entire saxophone family is represented: sopranos, altos, tenors and bass baritones. Although the group adapts to each place setting, the basic structure is the distribution of musicians on 4 or 5 scenes surrounding the public, allowing the movement of sound around it, and continues generally by the grouping of musicians on the front stage.\n\nOver the years, Urban Sax has expanded and now consists of bassists, singers, dancers, vibraphones, cellos, guitars and other instruments, and sometimes orchestra depending on the projects. The group is composed of approximately 40 musicians, but can easily go up to more than a hundred during performances. The appearance of the musicians has evolved, keeping a very special graphic cohesion. All dressed in suits, musicians have subsequently fitted colorful dresses for rotation and giving momentum on the stage. The musicians are also hidden and equipped with an inflated transparent plastic structure, \"bubbles\", a sort of chrysalis identity ...\n\nProjects adapt to places and contexts, and highlight a specific design for each of them. Gilbert Artman uses urban equipment as the stage: roofs, balconies, cranes, construction equipment, boats, etc. ... and seeks local talent : schools of music and dance, choirs, cavers or firemen. A \"Urbanian\" team oversees the workshops set up to prepare for the concert. The musical particularity of the group enabled them to approach \"ritual music\", also often attached to a continuous sound. This allowed Urban Sax to produce partitions and joint concerts with the Indians in Vancouver, a Javanese Gamelan and dancers in Jakarta, Sufi musicians in Turkey, court music in China etc. ... Urban Sax has played around the world, primarily in contexts of opening or closing of cultural events.\n\nThe fact that the musicians play masked developed a strong sense of identity and belonging, living groups were formed, groups of music were created. Urban Sax developed as a \"family\", a human adventure as much as a musical one.\n\nMembers (old and new):\n\n\n\n"}

During the Battle of the Coral Sea she was attacked and set alight, but managed to keep afloat until rendezvousing with an American destroyer on 11 May 1942, who sank her with gunfire after taking off the crew.\n\nShe was laid down under Maritime Commission contract by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey, 22 June 1938; launched on 29 April 1939; sponsored by Mrs. Emory S. Land, wife of Rear Admiral Emory S. Land (Ret.), Chairman of the Maritime Commission; and commissioned on 7 August 1939, with Commander AV. E. A. Mullan in command.\n\nConversion at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard was completed on 7 July 1941, \"Neosho\" immediately began the vital task of ferrying aviation fuel from west coast ports to Pearl Harbor. On such a mission she arrived in Pearl Harbor on 6 December, discharged a full cargo to Naval Air Station Ford Island, and prepared for the return passage.\n\nNext morning, the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor found \"Neosho\" alert to danger; her captain—Commander John S. Phillips—got her underway and maneuvered safely through the Japanese fire, concentrated on the battleships moored at Ford Island, to a safer area of the harbor. Her guns fired throughout the attack, splashing one enemy plane and driving off others. Three of her men were wounded by a strafing attacker.\n\nFor the next five months, \"Neosho\" sailed with the aircraft carriers or independently, since escort ships—now few and far between—could not always be spared to guard even so precious a ship and cargo. Late in April, as the Japanese threatened a southward move against Australia and New Zealand by attempting to advance their bases in the Southwest Pacific, \"Neosho\" joined Task Force 17 (TF 17). At all costs, the sea lanes to the dominions had to be kept open, and they had to be protected against attack and possible invasion.\n\nAs the American and Japanese fleets sought each other out in the opening maneuvers of the climactic Battle of the Coral Sea on 6 May 1942, \"Neosho\" refueled the carrier and the heavy cruiser , then retired from the carrier force with a lone escort, the destroyer .\nThe next day at 1000, Japanese search planes spotted the two ships and misidentified them as a carrier and her escort. 78 aircraft from \"Shōkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" soon arrived and began searching in vain for the \"carrier\" force. Eventually, they gave up and returned to sink \"Sims\" and leave \"Neosho\"—victim of seven direct hits and a suicide dive by one of the bombers—ablaze aft and in danger of breaking in two. She had shot down at least three of the attackers. One of her crewmen, Oscar V. Peterson, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his efforts to save the ship in spite of his severe injuries suffered in the attack.\n\nSound seamanship and skilled damage control work kept \"Neosho\" afloat for the next four days. The stricken ship was first located by a RAAF aircraft, then an American PBY Catalina flying boat. At 13:00 on 11 May, the destroyer arrived, rescued the 123 survivors and sank by gunfire the ship they had kept afloat. With \"Henley\" came word that the American fleet had succeeded in turning the Japanese back, marking the end of their southward expansion in World War II.\n\n\"Neosho\" received two battle stars for her service.\n\n\n"}

Most traffic is passenger trains, although there is considerable transit goods traffic between Sweden and Germany.\n\nMaintenance work on most Danish railway lines is done by Banedanmark, a state-owned company that also allocates tracks for train operators. The majority of passenger trains are operated by DSB, with Arriva and Nordjyske Jernbaner operating on some lines in Jutland. Goods transport is mainly performed by DB Schenker Rail, although other operators take care of a significant portion of the non-transit traffic.\n\nDenmark is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Denmark is 86.\n\nBanedanmark is in charge of 2,045 km of railway lines, which do not include the lines controlled by private railways. All Danish railways are (standard gauge), with the exception of a few narrow gauge museum railways; gauge was previously common on branch lines, with being prevalent on industry railways, such as those for transporting sugar beets. The narrow gauge lines generally disappeared during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe maximum speed allowed on main lines is generally 180 km/h, with less trafficked lines usually allowing between 75 and 120 km/h; the speed may be lowered in places due to the condition of the track. While wooden sleepers are used on sidings and branch lines, concrete sleepers are the norm on all main lines; the common two-block concrete sleepers are now being phased out in favour of monoblock ones.\n\nThe age of the tracks in Banedanmark's network has become increasingly problematic in later years. A 2002/03 analysis of Banestyrelsen's (now Banedanmark) network states that the average age of the track is too high, with a present average age of 24 years compared to the recommended 20 years.\n\nBanedanmark also owns the S-train lines, but does not own every railway in the country. It does not own local railways around Hillerød (such as Frederiksværk Line and Gribskov Line) and Østbanen, Odsherred Line, Tølløse Line, Thy Line, Lemvigbanen, Aarhus Letbane and Copenhagen Metro.\n\nGeneral-purpose electric propulsion was adopted quite recently in Denmark; the political decision to electrify the main lines was made in 1979. The first line to be electrified was Copenhagen–Elsinore, electrified in 1986, followed by the main line across Zealand, Funen and Southern Jutland in the 1980s–90s. On the main lines that are equipped with them, the overhead lines carry 25 kV AC at 50 Hz. The system is used on the main line from Sweden through Copenhagen to Fredericia, and from there to Padborg and the German border. 25 kV AC at 50 Hz is better from a technological point of view. However, both Sweden and Germany use 15 kV at 16 Hz and 16.7 Hz respectively, and the multi-system class EG goods locomotive is equipped for both 25 and 15 kV.\n\nThe S-train network in Copenhagen operates at 1650 V DC, supplied from overhead lines; the Copenhagen Metro uses 750 V DC, supplied from a third rail. It was the first electric network in Denmark, electrified around 1930.\n\nSince there are heavy delays (several years) with the construction of the new diesel multiple unit IC4, many debaters argue that it is better to electrify major railways and purchase electric multiple units instead, since that is a more common product. At least the route Fredericia-Ålborg must be electrified in order to run electric passenger trains between Jutland and Copenhagen. The route between Kolding-Esbjerg was due to be to open for electric trains in 2015. The government has in 2009 decided to delay all electrification for several years until the new signal system ERTMS is introduced, since electrification earlier than that requires rebuilding of the existing signal system.\n\nIn September 2013 the government reached a deal with the Danish People's Party and the Red-Green Alliance (Denmark) to use additional oil taxes to create a train fund. This train fund would be used to electrify all of the main line trains by 2025, and increase train speeds to for InterCity trains. This would allow for travel between the cities of Copenhagen, Odense, Esbjerg, Aarhus, and Aalborg in four hours.\n\nOn 29 May 2015 Banedanmark announced a 2.8 billion DKK (€375 million) contract to have Aarsleff-Siemens electrify 1300 km of tracks before 2026.\n\nMain lines were equipped with the ATC safety system during the 1990s, with a partial, cheaper implementation, ATC train stop, being used on some (but not all) branch lines. A different system, HKT, which was introduced in 1975 and utilises cab signalling, is used on the S-train network, although a simplified version, \"forenklet HKT\" (F-HKT), is used on some of the lines.\n\nDenmark has its own ATC system (ZUB 123), not compatible with other countries. It is a modification of the Swiss system. Trains crossing the border to Sweden or Germany have to have two ATC systems, and handle two electrical supply systems.\n\nIn order to replace the different and aging signal systems, it has been decided to replace all current signal systems on Banedanmark's active network, except the S-train lines, with ERTMS level 2, relying entirely on cab signalling; general rollout is scheduled for 2018–21. The S-train network is set to be refitted with a suitable urban rail system, possibly a CBTC system allowing driverless trains, by 2020.\n\nSerious incidents on Denmark's railways have been rare. The six most serious are listed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenmark has railway connections to Sweden and Germany, both of which use the same rail gauge as in Denmark. The electric voltage is different as Sweden and Germany use 15 kV AC while Denmark uses 25 kV AC. The train protection systems are also different between all three countries. This means that locomotives must be specially modified to cross the borders, while railway wagons can freely cross the border if there is a suitable locomotive.\n\nConnections to Sweden use the Øresund Railway across Øresund Bridge. Services include SJ's X 2000 service to Stockholm and Øresundståg commuter services to Malmö Central Station and beyond.\n\nThere are two connections to Germany. The main connection is over land at Padborg, which carries ICE, intercity and regional trains to Hamburg, and used to carry EuroNight and CityNightLine trains to Amsterdam via Cologne, Basel via Frankfurt, Munich via Nürnberg, and Prague via Berlin. The second crossing is overland at Tønder, Denmark and Süderlügum, Germany, which connects to Niebüll. The \"Vogelfluglinie\" route, is from december 2019 closed for trains, until then carried EuroCity and ICE services, using the train ferry from Rødby, Denmark to Puttgarden on the island of Fehmarn, Germany, and from there proceeded via Lübeck and Hamburg to Berlin. The Rødby ferry and Tønder crossing allow only diesel powered trains, while the Padborg crossing is electrified.\n\nSince November 2014, CityNightLine does not service Denmark anymore, so after this no night trains go in Denmark or over its borders.\n\nUrban rail transport in Denmark currently consists of one metro system in Copenhagen, one light rail system in Aarhus and two commuter rail systems in Copenhagen and Aalborg. Copenhagen had also a tram network from 1863 until 1972 when trams were replaced by buses and private cars because they were considered an old transportation method.\n\nOne rapid transit is proporsed for the Øresund metropolitan area is the Øresund Metro and two light rail systems are also proporsed for Copenhagen and Odense: Greater Copenhagen Light Rail and Odense Light Rail.\n\nIn Denmark there are two commuter rail systems: the Copenhagen S-train and the Aalborg Commuter Rail.\n\nThe Copenhagen Metro is an automated, 24-hour rapid transit system which serves Denmark's capital city, Copenhagen. It began operation in 2002. It is also the only rapid transit system in Denmark. As of March 2020, the system consists of four lines: M1, M2, M3 and M4. Planning of the Metro started in 1992 as part of the redevelopment plans for Ørestad with construction starting in 1996, and stage 1, from Nørreport to Vestamager and Lergravsparken, opened in 2002. Stage 2, from Nørreport to Vanløse, opened in 2003, followed by stage 3, from Lergravsparken to Lufthavnen, in 2007. \nThe City Circle Line is an entirely underground 15.5 km loop through central Copenhagen and Frederiksberg with 17 stops. It does not share any track with the M1 and M2 lines, but intersect them at Kongens Nytorv and Frederiksberg stations. With the City loop opened, the Metro expects that its ridership should almost double from its 2016 levels to 116 million annual passengers. \nA fourth line, M4, will be developed into a separate line between 2020 and 2024, as extensions of the Cityringen to Nordhavn and Sydhavn open. The two-stop three-kilometre-long line to Nordhavn opened in March 2020. The extension adds an interchange with Nordhavn S-train station. The five-stop, 4.5 km, extension to Sydhavn is also under construction, with planned opening in 2024. The Sydhavn line will terminate at Ny Ellebjerg where it will create a new regional rail transport hub by connecting the metro system to the S-train network, regional trains, and long-distance trains on the current lines and the upcoming high speed Copenhagen-Ringsted railway.

{"id": "2253499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253499", "title": "Past life regression", "text": "Past life regression\n\nPast life regression is a technique that uses hypnosis to recover what practitioners believe are memories of past lives or incarnations. The practice is widely considered discredited and unscientific by medical practitioners, and experts generally regard claims of recovered memories of past lives as fantasies or delusions or a type of confabulation. Past-life regression is typically undertaken either in pursuit of a spiritual experience, or in a psychotherapeutic setting. Most advocates loosely adhere to beliefs about reincarnation, though religious traditions that incorporate reincarnation generally do not include the idea of repressed memories of past lives. \n\nThe technique used during past-life regression involves the subject answering a series of questions while hypnotized to reveal identity and events of alleged past lives, a method similar to that used in recovered memory therapy and one that, similarly, often misrepresents memory as a faithful recording of previous events rather than a constructed set of recollections. The use of hypnosis and suggestive questions can tend to leave the subject particularly likely to hold distorted or false memories. The source of the memories is more likely cryptomnesia and confabulations that combine experiences, knowledge, imagination and suggestion or guidance from the hypnotist than recall of a previous existence. Once created, those memories are indistinguishable from memories based on events that occurred during the subject's life. Investigations of memories reported during past-life regression have revealed that they contain historical inaccuracies which originate from common beliefs about history, modern popular culture, or books that discuss historical events. Experiments with subjects undergoing past-life regression indicate that a belief in reincarnation and suggestions by the hypnotist are the two most important factors regarding the contents of memories reported.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, the Hindu scholar Patañjali, in his Yoga Sutras, discussed the idea of the soul becoming burdened with an accumulation of impressions as part of the karma from previous lives. Patañjali called the process of past-life regression \"prati-prasav\" (literally \"reverse birthing\"), and saw it as addressing current problems through memories of past lives. Some types of yoga continue to use \"prati-prasav\" as a practice.\n\nIn the religious mythology of China the deity Meng Po, also known as the \"Lady of Forgetfullness\", prevents souls from remembering their past lives: she gives them a bittersweet drink that erases all memories before they climb the wheel of reincarnation.\n\nPast life regression can be found in Jainism. The seven truths of Jainism deal with the soul and its attachment to karma. The fourth truth, Bandha, tells us that karma can stick to your soul. However, the seventh truth, Moksha, tells us that in order to be freed from the cycle of rebirth and death, one must separate karma from the soul. In order to find out what karma is attached to your soul, you can participate in “Jati-Smaran.” Jati-Smaran is remembering past lives \n\nThe nineteenth century saw the rise of Spiritualism, involving séances and other techniques for contacting departed spirits. Allan Kardec (1804–1869) sought to codify the lessons thus obtained in a set of five books, the \"Spiritist Codification\" (the\"Spiritist Pentateuch\", 1857–1868), including \"The Spirits Book\" (1857) and \"Heaven and Hell\" (1865) ; these books introduce concepts of how spirits evolve through a series of incarnations. Madame Blavatsky (1831–1891), co-founder of the Theosophical Society, introduced the Sanskrit term \"Akasha\", beginning in Isis Unveiled (1877) as a vague life force that was continuously redefined, always vaguely, in subsequent publications; separately, but also in Isis Unveiled, she referred to \"indestructible tablets of the astral light\" recording both the past and future of human thought and action. These concepts were combined into a single idea: the \"Akashic records\", espoused by Alfred Percy Sinnett in his book Esoteric Buddhism (1883). The idea that the \"Akashic records\" held past life data set the stage, whereby Western practitioners of the paranormal could sidestep the notion of forgetfulness that, in traditional teachings about reincarnation, had prevented memories of former lives from being accessed.\n\nAn early report for a human accessing past life information during a trace state comes from 1923, when Edgar Cayce, while answering questions posed by Arthur Lammers (publisher) in a trace state, spoke of Lammers' past lives and of reincarnation. The use of hypnosis for past life regressions is said to have been developed by A. R. (Asa Roy) Martin of Sharon, Pennsylvania, who published \"Researches in Reincarnation and Beyond\" in 1942.\n\nIn 1952 the Bridey Murphy case, in which housewife Virginia Tighe of Pueblo, Colorado, under hypnosis, was reported by the hypnotist to have recounted memories of a 19th-century Irish woman (\"Bridey Murphy\"). Past life regression therapy has been developed since the 1950s by psychologists, psychiatrists and mediums. The belief has gained a certain degree of credibility because some of the advocates possess legitimate credentials, such as Brian Weiss, who is an M.D. \n\nPast life regression is widely rejected as a psychiatric treatment by clinical psychiatrists and psychologists. A 2006 survey found that a majority of a sample of doctoral level mental health professionals rated \"Past Lives\" therapy as \"certainly discredited\" as a treatment for mental or behavioral disorders.\n\nIn the West, past-life regression practitioners use hypnosis and suggestion to promote recall in their patients, using a series of questions designed to elicit statements and memories about the past life's history and identity. Some practitioners also use bridging techniques from a client's current-life problem to bring \"past-life stories\" to conscious awareness. Practitioners believe that unresolved issues from alleged past lives may be the cause of their patients' problems. One technique for accessing memories from a past life is detailed in a study by Nicholas P. Spanos from Carleton University, Ontario, Canada. Subjects of a study were at first told that they would be undergoing a hypnosis, and afterwards told, “You are now in a different life, living in another life that you have lived before in another time. You are now reliving that other life that you lived once before in a different time.” Next, after the administer asks “What name can I call you by? I want you to look down and tell me what you are wearing. Describe everything you are wearing in detail. Where are you?” Afterwards, the subjects were to chronicle the information that they could remember after regression in a past life. Past life regression can be achieved in as little as 15 minutes, but to recall past a point of death, and into \"soul memories\", it takes upwards of 45 minutes of trance induction. However, with psychotherapy clients who believe in past lives, irrespective of whether or not past lives exist, the use of past lives as a tool has been suggested.\n\nThe \"memories\" recovered by techniques like past-life regression are the result of cryptomnesia: narratives created by the subconscious mind using imagination, forgotten information and suggestions from the therapist. Memories created under hypnosis are indistinguishable from actual memories and can be more vivid than factual memories. The greatest predictor of individuals reporting memories of past lives appears to be their beliefs—individuals who believe in reincarnation are more likely to report such memories, while skeptics or disbelievers are less so.\nExaminations of three cases of apparent past life regression (Bridey Murphy, Jane Evans, and an unnamed English woman) revealed memories that were superficially convincing. However, investigation by experts in the languages used and historical periods described revealed flaws in all three patients' recall. The evidence included speech patterns that were \"...used by movie makers and writers to convey the flavour of 16th century English speech\" rather than actual Renaissance English, a date that was inaccurate but was the same as a recognized printing error in historical pamphlets, and a subject that reported historically accurate information from the Roman era that was identical to information found in a 1947 novel set in the same time as the individual's memories, with the same name reported by the person regressed. Other details cited are common knowledge and not evidence of the factual nature of the memories; subjects asked to provide historical information that would allow checking provided only vague responses that did not allow for verification, and sometimes were unable to provide critical details that would have been common knowledge (e.g. a subject described the life of a Japanese fighter pilot during World War II but was unable to identify Hirohito as the Emperor of Japan during the 1940s).\n\nA 1976 study found that 40% of hypnotizable subjects described new identities and used different names when given a suggestion to regress past their birth. In the 1990s, a series of experiments undertaken by Nicholas Spanos examined the nature of past life memories. Descriptions of alleged past lives were found to be extremely elaborate, with vivid, detailed descriptions. This, however, is not indicative of the validity of this therapeutic method. Subjects who reported memories of past lives exhibited high hypnotizability, and patients demonstrated that the expectations conveyed by the experimenter were most important in determining the characteristics of the reported memories. The degree to which the memories were considered credible by the experimental subjects was correlated most significantly to the subjects' beliefs about reincarnation and their expectation to remember a past life rather than hypnotizability. Spanos' research leads him to the conclusion that past lives are not memories, but actually social constructions based on patients acting \"as if\" they were someone else, but with significant flaws that would not be expected of actual memories. To create these memories, Spanos' subjects drew upon the expectations established by authority figures and information outside of the experiment such as television, novels, life experiences and their own desires. In sum, it is therefore suggested that past lives are likely false memories, implanted through the susceptibility of the hypnotic method.\n\nPast life regression has been critiqued for being unethical on the premises that it lacks any evidence to support these claims, and that the act increases one's susceptibility to false memories. Luis Cordón states that this can be problematic as it creates delusions under the guise of therapy. The memories are experienced as vivid as those based on events experienced in one's life, impossible to differentiate from true memories of actual events, and accordingly any damage can be difficult to undo. As past life regression is rooted on the premise of reincarnation, many APA accredited organizations have begun to refute this as a therapeutic method on the basis of it being unethical. Additionally, the hypnotic methodology that underpins past life regression places the participant in a vulnerable position, susceptible to implantation of false memories. Because the implantation of false memories may be harmful, Gabriel Andrade points out that past life regression violates the principle of \"first, do no harm\" (non-maleficence), part of the Hippocratic Oath.\n\n"}

The concert took place at the Honolulu International Center (HIC) in Honolulu (now known as the Neal S. Blaisdell Center) and aired in over 40 countries across Asia and Europe (who received the telecast the next day, also in primetime). Despite the satellite innovation, NBC did not broadcast an edited version of the concert in the United States until April 4, 1973 because the concert took place the same day as Super Bowl VII. The decision paid off handsomely for the network, attracting 51 percent of the television viewing audience to become NBC’s highest rated program of the year. The show was the most expensive entertainment special at the time, costing $2.5 million.\n\nOn July 8, 1972, inspired by a recent visit made by U.S. President Richard Nixon to China a few months earlier, Presley's manager, Colonel Thomas Parker, announced that there would be a worldwide satellite broadcast from Hawaii to allow the whole world the chance to see a Presley concert \"since it is impossible for us to play in every major city.\" What neither Elvis nor his fans knew at the time was that, throughout his client's touring career and in spite of vast sums he was being offered, Dutch-born Parker habitually turned down all offers of international tours because he was in fact an illegal immigrant, and feared that if he tried to leave the country he would be exposed, and might be deported back to the Netherlands. Parker initially stated that it would take place in either October or November 1972, but this date was changed to early 1973 after MGM showed concern about it clashing with the release of their documentary film \"Elvis on Tour.\" As the show had already been planned prior to this upset, the original shows, now set for November, would still go ahead but without being filmed.\n\nParker held another press conference on September 4, 1972, in Las Vegas to confirm that the concert, now titled \"Aloha From Hawaii,\" would be broadcast on January 14, 1973. The press were told that an audience of 1 billion was expected to tune in to see the \"first entertainment special to be broadcast live around the world,\" even though Parker had not taken into account the fact that many countries, including parts of Europe and America, would not see the concert live due to the time of the broadcast. Although the \"Our World\" TV special was the first live international satellite television production, broadcast worldwide on June 25, 1967 which included entertainment artists such as The Beatles (headlining) and Maria Callas, \"Aloha From Hawaii\" was the first live satellite concert to be with a single performer. Two weeks after the Las Vegas press conference Parker received a letter from \"Honolulu Advertiser\" columnist Eddie Sherman. Sherman had read in news accounts that there was to be no charge for admittance to the concerts, instead a donation for charity was required. He suggested to Parker that, as Presley had recorded, and was still performing, the song \"I'll Remember You,\" which had been written and composed by Kui Lee, the donations could go to the Kui Lee Cancer Fund that had been set up following the death of the songwriter in 1966. Seeing the chance to publicize Presley's charitable nature once again, Parker eagerly agreed.\n\nProducer-director Marty Pasetta had attended one of Presley's concerts at Long Beach in mid-November, and he had found it to be \"boring\" and lacking in any physical excitement. He approached Parker with ideas about the broadcast, including a runway that led out from the stage so Presley could get closer to his audience. Parker insisted that the ideas were useless, and that Presley would agree that they were useless. Pasetta, however, decided to approach Presley about the ideas anyway and was pleasantly surprised to find that he would be happy to do whatever Pasetta felt was best for the show. This was another example of the ever-growing rift between Presley and his manager. Although Presley would later dismiss Parker, whom he never truly befriended and towards whom he was openly hostile in his later years, the two would reconcile professionally shortly thereafter, and Parker would remain Presley's manager for the rest of the artist's life.\n\nPresley performed three shows over November 17 and 18 in Honolulu, the dates originally planned for the satellite broadcast, and gave a press conference on November 20 to promote the satellite special. He also announced officially that it would now be in aid of the Kui Lee Cancer Fund.\n\nPresley arrived in Hawaii again on January 9, the day after his thirty-eighth birthday, to begin rehearsals. He had lost twenty-five pounds for the show and was confident after news that his record sales were increasing and that \"Elvis on Tour\" had been nominated for a Golden Globe. Rehearsals were held at the Hilton Hawaiian Village while the main set was being constructed. Although there were several technical problems, the rehearsals were an overall success.\n\nPresley taped a January 12 rehearsal concert as a fail-safe in case anything went wrong with the satellite during the actual broadcast. This concert was eventually released as the 'Alternate Aloha'. For both shows, Presley was dressed in a white \"American Eagle\" jumpsuit designed by Bill Belew. The broadcast was directed by Marty Pasetta, who was then in charge of directing the Oscar ceremonies.\n\nAudience tickets for the January 14 concert and its January 12 pre-broadcast rehearsal show carried no charge. Each audience member was asked to pay whatever he or she could afford. The performance and concert merchandise sales raised $75,000 for the Kui Lee Cancer Fund in Hawaii.\n\nAccording to Elvis Presley Enterprises, between 1 and 1.5 billion people watched the one-hour broadcast live worldwide.\n\nAfter the concert ended, Presley returned to the empty arena with the TCB Band after the fans left to record five songs for the U.S. airing of the show, including Gordon Lightfoot's \"Early Morning Rain,\" along with some songs from the movie \"Blue Hawaii\"; including \"Hawaiian Wedding Song,\" \"No More,\" \"Ku-U-I-Po,\" and of course the title song. All but \"No More\" was used in the telecast.\n\nThe album containing the music from the concert was a blockbuster hit, becoming Presley's first chart-topping album in the US since the soundtrack to \"Roustabout\" in 1965. The original release of the album, however, did not include the five post-show performances. The album would be Presley's final number 1 album during his lifetime.\n\nInitially released only in quadraphonic sound, the album was the first quadraphonic album to top the \"Billboard\" album chart, and remains the biggest-selling release in the format.\n\nPresley was accompanied by:\n\nBackground vocalists:\nThe TCB Band:\nThe Joe Guercio Orchestra:\nIn September 2004, \"Aloha from Hawaii\" (Special Edition) together with \"The '68 Comeback Special\" was released on DVD.

This edition contains some new material which was not included in the original deluxe release. The new material consists of some TV news footage shot during the arrival, offering an alternate look on the event and portions of two press conferences held for the upcoming live broadcast in September and November 1972.

{"id": "2253520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253520", "title": "John MacHale", "text": "John MacHale\n\nJohn MacHale (; 6 March 1789 – 7 November 1881) was the Irish Roman Catholic Archbishop of Tuam, and Irish nationalist.\n\nHe laboured and wrote to secure Catholic Emancipation, legislative independence, justice for tenants and the poor, and vigorously assailed the proselytizers and the government's proposal for a mix-faith national school system. He preached regularly to his flock in Irish and ‘almost alone among the Bishops he advocated the use of Irish by the Catholic clergy.’\n\nJohn MacHale was born in Tubbernavine, near Lahardane, County Mayo, Ireland. Bernard O'Reilly places the date in the spring of 1791, while others suggest 1789 more likely. His parents were Patrick and Mary Mulkieran MacHale. He was so feeble at birth that he was baptised at home by Father Andrew Conroy, who later was hanged during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. His father, known locally as \"Pádraig Mór\", was a farmer, whose house served as a wayside inn on the highroad between Sligo and Castlebar. Although Irish was always spoken by the peasants at that time, the MacHale children were all taught English. John's grandmother, however, encouraged him to retain his knowledge of Irish.\n\nBy the time he was five years of age, he began attending a hedge school. Three important events happened during John's childhood: the Irish Rebellion of 1798; the landing at Killala of French troops, whom the boy, hidden in a stacked sheaf of flax, watched marching through a mountain pass to Castlebar; and a few months later the brutal execution of Father Conroy on a false charge of high treason. These occurrences made an indelible impression upon him. After school hours he studied Irish history, under the guidance of an old scholar in the neighbourhood. Being destined for the priesthood, at the age of thirteen, the boy was sent to a school at Castlebar to learn Latin, Greek, and English grammar. In his sixteenth year the Bishop of Killala gave him a busarship at St Patrick's College, Maynooth at Maynooth.\n\nThe emigrant French priests who then taught at Maynooth appreciated the linguistic aptitude of the young man and taught him not only French, but also Latin, Greek, Italian, German, Hebrew, and the English classics. After seven years of study, he was appointed in 1814 lecturer in theology, although only a sub-deacon. Before the end of the year, however, at the age of twenty-four, he was ordained a priest by Daniel Murray, Archbishop of Dublin. Father MacHale continued his lectures at Maynooth until 1820, when he was nominated professor of theology.\n\nDr. MacHale was then above medium height, of rather an athletic figure. Dignified and reserved in demeanour, his simple and unassuming manners and attractive conversation procured him many admirers, including the liberal Augustine Frederick FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster, who often invited him to Carton House, where he had frequent opportunities of meeting men capable of appreciating his intellect and character. About this period he commenced a series of letters to the \"Dublin Journal\", signed \"Hierophilus\", vigorously attacking the Irish Established Church's system of religious education in schools. These attracted the notice of Daniel O'Connell and led to a very sincere friendship between them. In 1825, Pope Leo XII appointed him titular bishop of Maronia, and coadjutor bishop to Dr. Thomas Waldron, Bishop of Killala.\n\nAfter his consecration in Maynooth College chapel, he devoted himself to his sacred duties. He preached Irish and English sermons, and superintended the missions given in the diocese for the Jubilee of 1825. The next year Dr. MacHale joined Bishop Doyle (\"J.K.L\") in denouncing the proselytising Kildare Street Society of Dublin. He also attended the annual meeting of the Irish bishops, and gave evidence at Maynooth College before the Parliamentary Commissioners then inquiring into the condition of education in Ireland. The Catholic hierarchy's policy in the following decades was to ensure that Irish primary schools for Catholic children were run by Catholics, while the Dublin administration wanted all such schools to be run on a mixed-faith basis. The officials felt that two parallel systems would be too expensive and socially divisive, but the hierarchy felt that this would result in a default system based on the English version of history that had often been anti-Catholic since 1570.\n\nAbout this time he also revised a theological manual \"On the Evidences and Doctrines of the Catholic Church\", afterward translated into German. With his friend and ally, Daniel O'Connell, MacHale took a prominent part in the important question of Catholic Emancipation, impeaching in unmeasured terms the severities of the former penal code, which had branded Catholics with the stamp of inferiority. During 1826 his zeal was omnipresent; \"he spoke to the people in secret and public, by night and by day, on the highways and in places of public resort, calling up the memories of the past, denouncing the wrongs of the present, and promising imperishable rewards to those who should die in the struggle for their faith. He called on the Government to remember how the Act of Union in 1800 was carried by William Pitt the Younger on the distinct assurance and implied promise that Catholic Emancipation, which had been denied by the Irish Parliament, should be granted by the Parliament of the Empire.\"\n\nIn two letters written to the Prime Minister, Earl Grey, he described the distress occasioned by starvation and fever in Connacht, the ruin of the linen trade, the vestry tax for the benefit of Protestant churches, the tithes to the Protestant clergy, which Catholics were obliged to pay as well as their Protestant countrymen, the exorbitant rents extracted by absentee landlords, and the crying abuse of forcing the peasantry to buy seed-corn and seed-potatoes from landlords and agents at usurious charges. No attention was paid to these letters. Dr. MacHale accompanied to London a deputation of Mayo gentlemen, who received only meaningless assurances from Earl Grey. After witnessing the coronation of William IV at Westminster Abbey, the bishop, requiring change of air on account of ill-health, went on to Rome, but not before he had addressed to the premier another letter informing him that the scarcity in Ireland \"was a famine in the midst of plenty, the oats being exported to pay rents, tithes, etc., and that the English people were actually sending back in charity what had originally grown on Irish soil plus freightage and insurance\". It may be observed that Dr. MacHale never blamed the English people, whose generosity he acknowledged. On the other hand he severely condemned the Government for its incapacity, its indifference to the wrongs of Ireland, that aroused in the Irish peasantry a sullen hatred unknown to their more simple-minded forefathers. During an absence of sixteen months he wrote excellent descriptive letters of all he saw on the Continent. They were eagerly read in \"The Freeman's Journal\", while the sermons he preached in Rome were so admired that they were translated into Italian. Amid the varied interests of the Eternal City he was ever mindful of Ireland's woes and forwarded thence another protest to Earl Gray against tithes, and proselytism, this last grievance being then rampant, particularly in Western Connacht.\n\nOn his return he became an opponent of the proposed system of non-sectarian 'National Schools', fearing that the bill as originally framed, was an insidious attempt to weaken the faith of Catholic children. The policy of the Stanley letter was to provide a new state-funded primary school system without religious indoctrination. McHale's overview was that in many ways he owned his flock, body and soul, and would educate them as he saw fit.\n\nOliver Kelly, Archbishop of Tuam, died in 1834, and the clergy selected MacHale as one of three candidates, to the annoyance of the Government who despatched agents to induce the pope not to nominate him to the vacant see. Pope Gregory XVI dryly remarked:\n\nDisregarding their request, the pope appointed MacHale Archbishop of Tuam. He was the first prelate since the Reformation who had received his entire education in Ireland. The corrupt practices of general parliamentary elections and the Tithe War caused frequent rioting and bloodshed, and were the subjects of denunciation by the new archbishop, until the passing of a Tithes bill in 1838. Archbishop MacHale now began in the newspapers a series of open letters to the Government, whereby he frequently harassed the ministers into activity in Irish affairs. MacHale also led the opposition to the Protestant Second Reformation, which was being pursued by evangelical clergy in the Church of Ireland, including the Bishop of Tuam, Thomas Plunket.\n\nDuring the Autumn of 1835, he visited the Island of Achill, a stronghold of the Bible Readers. To offset their proselytism, he sent thither more priests and Franciscan friars of the Third Order.\n\nMacHale condemned the Poor Law, and the system of National Schools and Queen's Colleges as devised by the Government. He founded his own schools, entrusting those for boys to the Christian Brothers and Franciscan friars, while Sisters of Mercy and Presentation Nuns taught the girls. Want of funds restricted the number of these schools, which had to be supplemented by the National Board at a later period, when the necessary amendments had been added to the Bill.\n\nThe repeal of the Union, advocated by Daniel O'Connell, enlisted his ardent sympathy and he assisted the Liberator in many ways, and remitted subscriptions from his priests for this purpose. We are told by his biographer Bernard O'Reilly, that like his friend, the prelate \"was for a thorough and universal organisation of Irishmen in a movement for obtaining by legal and peaceful agitation the restoration of Ireland's legislative independence\". The Charitable Bequests Bill, formerly productive of numerous lawsuits owing to its animus against donations to religious orders, was vehemently opposed by the archbishop. In this he differed considerably from some other Irish prelates, who thought that each bishop should exercise his own judgment as to his acceptance of a commissionership on the Board, or as regarded the partial application of the Act. The latter has since then been so amended, that in its present form it is quite favourable to Catholic charities and the Catholic poor. In his zeal for the cause of the Catholic religion and of Ireland, so long down-trodden, but not in the 1830s, Dr. MacHale frequently incurred from his opponents the charge of intemperate language, something not altogether undeserved. He did not possess that suavity of manner which is so invaluable to leaders of men and public opinion, and so he alarmed or offended others. In his anxiety to reform abuses and to secure the welfare of Ireland, by an uncompromising and impetuous zeal, he made many bitter and unrelenting enemies. This was particularly true of British ministers and their supporters, by whom he was dubbed \"a firebrand\", and \"a dangerous demagogue\". Cardinal Barnabo, Prefect of Propaganda, who had serious disagreements with Dr. MacHale, declared he was a twice-dyed Irishman, a good man ever insisting on getting his own way. This excessive inflexibility, not sufficiently tempered by prudence, explains his more or less stormy career.\n\nThe Irish famine of 1846–47 affected his diocese more than any. In the first year he announced in a sermon that the famine was a divine punishment on his flock for their sins (as did Cardinal Wiseman). Then by 1846 he warned the Government as to the state of Ireland, reproached them for their dilatoriness, and held up the uselessness of relief works expended on high roads instead of on quays and piers to develop the sea fisheries. From England as well as other parts of the world, cargoes of food were sent to the starving Irish. Bread and soup were distributed from the archbishop's kitchen. Donations sent to him were acknowledged, accounted for, and disbursed by his clergy among the victims.\n\nThe death of Daniel O'Connell (1847) was a setback to MacHale as were the subsequent disagreements within the Repeal Association. He strongly advised against the violence of Young Ireland.\n\nIn 1848, he visited Rome and by his representations to Pope Pius IX inflicted a deadly blow upon the proposed 'Queen's Colleges'. He also succeeded in preventing diplomatic intercourse between the British Government and Rome. The 1850 Synod of Thurles emphasised differences within the hierarchy on education with MacHale strongly in favour of exclusively Catholic institutions, along with Papal policy.\n\nDuring the recrudescence of \"No Popery\" in 1851, on the occasion of the re-establishment of the English Catholic hierarchy, and the passing of the Ecclesiastical Titles Act that inflicted penalties upon any Roman Catholic prelate who assumed the title of his see, MacHale defiantly signed his letters to Government on this subject \"John, Archbishop of Tuam\". This act of defiance so startled the Cabinet that it was considered more prudent not to attempt a prosecution and to allow the Bill to remain a dead letter.\n\nAs to the Catholic University, though Dr. MacHale had been foremost in advocating the project, he disagreed completely with Paul Cullen, Archbishop of Dublin, concerning its management, particularly the appointment of John Henry Newman as rector - a disagreement that handicapped the new university.\n\nThe archbishop approved of Tenant Right and also of the Irish Tenant League. He wrote to O'Connell's son that it \"was the assertion of the primitive right of man to enjoy in security and peace the fruit of his industry and labour\". At a conference held in Dublin, there was cross-denominational support for his views on \"fixity of tenure, free sale, and fair rent\", and these were provided for in the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870.\n\nToward the end of his life he became less active in politics.\n\nMacHale attended the First Vatican Council in 1869. He thought that the favourable moment had not arrived for an immediate definition of the dogma of papal infallibility. Better to leave it a matter of faith, not written down, and consequently he spoke and voted in the council against its promulgation. This incident is mentioned in the chapter \"Grace\" in \"Dubliners\" by James Joyce.\n\nOnce the dogma had been defined, he declared the dogma of infallibility \"to be true Catholic doctrine, which he believed as he believed the Apostles' Creed\". In 1877, to the disappointment of the archbishop who desired that his nephew should be his co-adjutor, Dr. John McEvilly, Bishop of Galway, was elected by the clergy of the archdiocese, and was commanded by Pope Leo XIII after some delay, to assume his post. He had opposed this election as far as possible, but submitted to the papal order.\n\nEvery Sunday he preached a sermon in Irish at the cathedral, and during his diocesan visitations he always addressed the people in their native tongue, which was still largely used in his diocese. On journeys he usually conversed in Irish with his attendant chaplain, and had to use it to address people of Tuam or the beggars who greeted him whenever he went out. He preached his last Irish sermon after his Sunday Mass, April 1881. He died seven months later.\n\nA marble statue perpetuates his memory in the Cathedral grounds.\n\nThe Cork-born Irish-American composer Paul McSwiney (1856–1890) was in the process of writing the cantata \"John McHale\" for centenary celebrations in New York City in 1891, but died before he could complete it.\n\nMacHale Park in Castlebar, County Mayo and Archbishop McHale College in Tuam are named after him. In his Birthplace the Parish of Addergoole, the local Gaa Club “Lahardane MacHales” is named in his honour. The Dunmore GAA team is named after him \"Dunmore MacHales\", which play underage teams to senior teams.\n\nAmong his writings are a treatise on the evidences of Catholicism and translations in Irish of Moore's \"\"Melodies\",\" and part of the Bible and the Iliad. He compiled an Irish language catechism and prayer book. Moreover, he made translations into Irish of portions of the scriptures as well as the Latin hymns, \"Dies Irae\" and \"Stabat Mater\".\n\n\n"}

Released in a limited edition of 3,000 copies, it was the band's final release for Lazy Records and second to feature vocalist and guitarist Bilinda Butcher, who was recruited in April 1987 following the departure of original My Bloody Valentine vocalist David Conway. \"Ecstasy\" followed the noise pop and twee pop standards of My Bloody Valentine's earlier releases for the label, drawing influence from various artists including The Jesus and Mary Chain, Love and The Byrds, and the album distanced the band further from their earlier post-punk and gothic rock sound.\n\nThe album experienced several technical and financial problems during its recording sessions, including errors in the mastering process, and the band were dissatisfied with its outcome; although upon its release, \"Ecstasy\" received moderate critical acclaim and peaked at number 12 on the UK Independent Albums Chart. The album was later combined with My Bloody Valentine's preceding single, \"Strawberry Wine\", and reissued on the compilation album \"Ecstasy and Wine\" (1989), which was released on Lazy Records without the band's consent.\n\nFollowing minor success on the underground scene after the release of \"The New Record by My Bloody Valentine\" (1986) and 1987's \"Sunny Sundae Smile\", original My Bloody Valentine vocalist David Conway left the band due to a gastric illness, disillusionment with music and his ambitions to become a writer. The remaining members—guitarist Kevin Shields, drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig and bassist Debbie Googe—considered splitting up and forming a new band under a different name. However, the band placed advertisements for a vocalist in the local music press in London, which Shields referred to later as \"pointless, … disastrous and excrutiating \" due to the advertisements attracting a number of Morrissey inspired vocalists who he referred to as \"fruitballs\". Through mutual friends the band recruited two vocalists, Joe Byfield and Bilinda Butcher. After performing one show in April 1987 with both on vocals, My Bloody Valentine considered Byfield \"unsuitable\" for the band and he was subsequently fired. Butcher, whose prior musical experience had been playing classical guitar as a child, and singing and playing tambourine \"with some girlfriends for fun\", was chosen as My Bloody Valentine's new vocalist and began rehearsing with the band in the middle of 1987.\nLazy Records, on which the band released \"Sunny Sundae Smile\", requested a full-length album from My Bloody Valentine during summer 1987. The band refused the label's request, claiming their newly formed line-up \"had only been together a couple of months and hadn't really had time to get settled\". However, the band compromised and agreed to record a mini album, provided they could release a single beforehand. The preceding single, \"Strawberry Wine\", was released on 9 November 1987 and peaked at number 13 on the UK Independent Singles Chart.\n\nThe recording sessions for \"Ecstasy\" took place a week after the recording sessions for \"Strawberry Wine\". My Bloody Valentine spent a total of 10 days recording the album. According to Kevin Shields, the sessions \"had no direction and [the band] didn't even know what [they] were doing\" and \"bashed out all these tunes quickly, very demo-like\". A number of songs were recorded that did not feature on the final release, as the band considered them \"awful\". However, the sessions were \"the first time [the band had] actually played around properly in the studio\", which resulted in \"extreme\" and \"quite nasty\" guitar sounds, which My Bloody Valentine would later become associated with.\n\n\"Ecstasy\"s recording was plagued by technical and financial errors, which impacted the eventual release of the album. The mastering process was affected by the album's engineer Steve Nunn, who mislaid the source material of the final mix prior to its transfer to the master recording. Shields subsequently \"brought an independent engineer in to the studios to point out what was wrong\" but Lazy Records refused to invest further finances into the album's recording process. As a result, \"much of what was originally the sound of \"Ecstacy\" was lost, and much of the tone was dulled\" and the album \"showed a group who appeared to have run out of money half way through recording\".\n\nAll of \"Ecstasy\"s seven tracks were written and composed by Kevin Shields, with Colm Ó Cíosóig credited as the co-writer of three tracks—\"The Things I Miss\", \"Clair\" and \"(Please) Lose Yourself in Me\". Regarding the lyrical content of the album in contrast to the music, Shields said that \"the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. A lot of it is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere\". Ó Cíosóig remarked that \"it's more weird perversions of feeling you get in a relationship\" and referred to the lyrics as being marked by \"extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things\". Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as \"the idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to our sense of humour\" and considered the songwriting process for \"Ecstasy\" as \"fresh after having made pure noise earlier\".\n\nMy Bloody Valentine experimented with a noise pop sound on the album, a venture which was influenced by The Jesus and Mary Chain, and incorporated elements of twee pop similar to \"Strawberry Wine\". Shields used a twelve-string electric guitar during the \"Ecstasy\"s recording sessions and was influenced by The Byrds during the writing process, which resulted in the guitar tones being \"too jingly jangly\". Writer Colin Larkin described \"Ecstasy\"s sound as \"bubblegum pop with buzzsaw guitars\", which was similar to their prior releases and further diverged from their earlier post-punk and gothic rock sound. Jim DeRogatis noted that \"Ecstasy\"s overall sound \"ushered in a sunnier, more optimistic vibe\" for the band which was reminiscent of the sound of 1960s American psychedelia, in particular the Los Angeles based band Love. \"Clair\", one of the first recordings to feature Bilinda Butcher, features a sampled tape loop of audience screams from The Beatles live album, \"The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl\" (1977). The sample was processed through audio filters to emulate guitar feedback.\nHowever, the music on \"Ecstasy\" has been criticised as being \"directionless and floundered about within the framework of songs which appeared to be only half formed ideas,\" which was due to the band's in-studio experimentation with different aspects of their guitar sound. In hindsight, Shields said that \"even when we'd finished it we didn't like half the songs we'd done. The record never came out right and it made us realise that we were still too twee\". In response to the band's \"unwanted reputation for jangly feyness\", My Bloody Valentine later incorporated elements of American indie rock music and Shields customised his guitars' tremolo systems, resulting in the band pioneering an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing. The term \"shoegazing\", which was considered derogatory, was coined by \"Sounds\" journalists in the early 1990s to describe certain bands' \"motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor\".\n\n\"Ecstasy\" was released on 23 November 1987 on Lazy Records. It received a limited edition release of 3,000 LP copies distributed by Rough Trade Records and went out of print within three months of its release. The album entered the UK Independent Albums Chart in December 1987 and spent four weeks in total on the chart, peaking at number 12. The contents of the album were later combined with the band's preceding single, \"Strawberry Wine\", and reissued on the compilation album \"Ecstasy and Wine\", released in February 1989 on Lazy Records. \"Ecstasy and Wine\", however, was released without the band's consent and Kevin Shields retrieved 10,000 LP copies from the manager of Lazy Records soon after its release. Shields sold the records to various distributors in the early 1990s, after My Bloody Valentine were dropped from Creation Records, and used the funds to finance later recording sessions.\n\nUpon its release \"Ecstasy\" received moderate critical acclaim. \"Melody Maker\" referred to the album as \"a series of aloof, pastel washes of sound, suspended guitars, words from the back of beyond tying in to a large, shifting whole\" and \"larger than the sum of its parts\". In \"Loveless\", a book from the 33⅓ series about the My Bloody Valentine album of the same name, Mike McGonial referred to \"Ecstasy\" as a \"rarified, effete and poppy approach to Byrdsian rock\" and AllMusic rated the album two and a half out of five stars. In a separate review of \"Ecstasy and Wine\", AllMusic writer Bradley Torreano described \"Ecstasy\" as the point where the band \"started moving toward Cocteau Twins territory, using guitarist Bilinda Butcher's airy voice to define their image\" and when \"Shields and Butcher [were] exploring the guitar landscapes that would later become their trademark\".\n\nOn \"Ecstasy\"s supporting tour My Bloody Valentine conceived the idea of \"the holocaust\", an interlude of noise and excessive feedback during live performances which was later attributed to their song \"You Made Me Realise\" and often exceeded 130 decibels. The band toured small student venues and, according to Kevin Shields, at \"one particular place, there were these guy playing pool in the background, shouting amongst themselves and being quite loud and not paying attention\". Before performing \"Clair\", Shields said to the band \"let's just do it until those guys stop\" and performed a two-chord riff in the song that lasted for an approximate 30 minutes.\n\nAll personnel credits adapted from \"Ecstasy\"s liner notes.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nTechnical personnel\n\n\n"}

He enrolled for a summer course at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, where one classmate was the future celebrated military cartoonist Bill Mauldin. After high school, Kweskin worked as a copyboy for \"Chicago Tribune\" newspaper, and then entered the U.S. Army.\n\nFrom February 1943 to September 1944, during World War II, Private Kweskin served with the 83rd Chemical Mortar Battalion. Afterward, through December 1945, he was the wartime artist for the 83rd Chemical Mortar Battalion. After his discharge, he studied at the Art Institute of Chicago, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in early 1949. He worked for year with former Walt Disney Pictures animator Sam Singer, doing two children's cartoon series for the local ABC-TV station. Kweskin then left to develop his own local children's-TV programs.\n\nHe later drew comic-book bible stories for David C. Cook Publishing in Elgin, Illinois. A friend put Kweskin in touch with New York City's Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics, and Kweskin \"flew into NYC in August or September 1952\" to meet with Atlas editor-in-chief Stan Lee. Kweskin did well on a sample story, and continued to freelance comic-book art for the company from back home in Chicago. Shortly thereafter, Kweskin, his wife and their two small children moved to New York City.\n\nKweskin's earliest confirmed credits include penciling and self-inking stories in three Atlas comics cover-dated February 1953: The horror/mystery books \"Strange Tales\" #15 and \"Adventures Into Terror\" #16, and the war comic \"Battlefront\" #9. He continued drawing stories for such Atlas horror anthologies as \"Journey into Mystery\", \"Marvel Tales\", and \"Uncanny Tales\", Western titles including \"Kid Colt, Outlaw\" and \"Wild Western\", and even \"Bible Tales for Young Folk\".\n\nAfter about a year, during a downturn in the comics industry, Kweskin returned to the Midwest.

He later began a small agency of his own.\n\nIn 1957, he freelanced briefly again for Atlas, on the science fiction anthology \"World of Fantasy\".\n\nIn the early 1970s, Kweskin briefly returned to freelancing for what was now formally Marvel Comics. He both wrote and penciled a six-page horror tale, \"Revenge from the Rhine\", in \"Journey into Mystery\" vol. 2, #3 (Feb. 1973), and then succeeded Sub-Mariner creator Bill Everett on that character's comic-book title following Everett's death; Kweskin and Everett together penciled issue #58 (Feb. 1973), with Everett inking and Kweskin penciled or laid out #59-60 and 62-63.\n\nAs Kweskin wrote in a 2002 e-mail excerpted in an article by comics historian Ken Quattro:\nAfterward he spent three years as an art director at Ziff-Davis magazines, and then freelanced for 10 years as an ad-agency storyboard artist.

As of the third quarter of 2014, Anglogold was the world's third-largest producer of gold, behind Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining.\n\nAngloGold Ashanti was formed on 26 April 2004, after the High Court of Ghana approved the merger of AngloGold and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation three days earlier. AngoGold had been a gold mining company based in South Africa, majority-owned by the Anglo American group. This came almost a year after the merger was announced on 16 May 2003.

These dresses, which became popular around the mid-19th century, are characterized by unstructured lines and light fabrics. Early tea gowns were a European development influenced by Asian clothing and historical approach from the 18th century which led to the renaissance time period of long and flowing sleeves. Part of this European sense of fashion came from the Japanese kimono which was worn by Japanese women during a wedding or any formal ceremonies.\n\nTea gowns were intended to be worn without a corset or assistance from the maid; however, elegance always came first.\n\nDuring the 19th century, it was not appropriate for women to be seen in public wearing a tea gown. They were intended to be worn indoors with family and close friends during a dinner party.\n\nAlthough tea gowns were meant for midday wear, they could be worn into the evening. Women started wearing tea gowns in the evening for dinner or certain events at home with close friends and family by 1900. Tea gowns intended for day wear usually had high necks, while evening tea gowns had lower necks.\n\n"}

He is a major contributor to the applied mathematical field referred to as sabermetrics. Along with the Bill James \"Baseball Abstracts\", Palmer's book \"The Hidden Game of Baseball\" is often referred to as providing the foundation upon which the field of sabermetrics was built.\n\nPalmer began his career as a baseball analyst when he worked for the Raytheon Corporation as a radar systems engineer. At night, after his co-workers had left for the day, Palmer used the company's (at the time) cutting-edge computers to run advanced simulations analyzing historical baseball statistics. In 1982, he gained notoriety when he recognized a scorekeeper's error which counted a 1910 Detroit Tigers box score twice, crediting Ty Cobb with an extra two hits and three at-bats. That year Cobb was declared the batting champion, despite an unsuccessful effort by the St. Louis Browns to help Cleveland Naps star Nap Lajoie overtake Cobb. If the double-counted game were to be removed Cobb's average would finish second to Lajoie, though Major League Baseball still lists Cobb as the batting average leader. Palmer also innovated the Linear Weights method of estimating a player's offensive contributions, an invention that will likely be his lasting legacy. Palmer, with help from Dick Cramer, invented OPS (on-base plus slugging) in 1978, which now is universally accepted as a measure of batting ability.\n\nMany of Palmer's early works were written in partnership with John Thorn, including \"The Hidden Game of Baseball\" and \"Total Baseball\"; the latter book also featured, in later editions, the contributions of editor Michael Gershman. Palmer edited or served as a consultant for many of the sports reference books produced by Total Sports Publishing. Palmer's most recent work has been in collaboration with Gary Gillette. Since 2003, the pair has produced five editions of the \"ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia\", and several other baseball annuals. In 2010 he was named a charter member of the Henry Chadwick Society by SABR (Society for American Baseball Research) and also received a lifetime achievement award from them in 2018.\n\nPalmer has also played a significant role in the field of football statistics. In the seventies, he served as editor for several editions of the A.S. Barnes football encyclopedia. In 1973, he joined the stat crew of the New England Patriots, compiling the official statistics for the team's home games. Palmer continued this task through the 2016 season.\n\nIn 1988, Palmer published \"The Hidden Game of Football,\" with co-authors Thorn and Bob Carroll. The book was updated and re-released in 1998 and is still considered the seminal work on football analysis. He was also co-editor (with Gillette, Sean Lahman, et al.) of the \"ESPN Pro Football Encyclopedia.\"\n\nPalmer has three children. Emily, the oldest, Stephen, the youngest, and Daniel.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the American Wrestling Association.\n\nBorn in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, Regal started wrestling in 1977 and later achieved his biggest success in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) during the mid-1980s. During his tenure there, Regal defeated Buck Zumhofe for the AWA World Light Heavyweight Championship in 1984. In 1985, the AWA began teaming him with \"Gorgeous\" Jimmy Garvin and, with the help of the Fabulous Freebirds, surprisingly defeated The Road Warriors to win the tag title. Regal and Garvin lost the tag title to Curt Hennig and Scott Hall four months later. Regal also made appearances with World Class Championship Wrestling during this time period, challenging Brian Adias for the Texas Heavyweight Title.\n\nThe pair then signed to wrestle with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Pacific Northwest Wrestling, where he held the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship twice. He vacated the title in December 1981 due to an injury.\n\nIn 1986, he joined Jim Crockett Promotions and made his debut on May 17 at a house show in Baltimore, MD where he fought Denny Brown to a draw for the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. They would wrestle several more times to draws during the month. Regal made his first televised appearance on the May 31st edition of NWA Worldwide, facing Rocky King. On the June 7th edition of NWA Pro Regal joined heel Jimmy Garvin in attacking Wahoo McDaniel.\n\nOn June 4 he sustained his first loss, falling to Denny Brown at a house show in Raleigh, NC. Through June and July Regal continued to face Brown for the title on the Great American Bash house show summer tour; on the final night of the series he defeated Brown to win the NWA Junior Heavyweight Championship in front of 12,000 at the Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, GA on August 2. Regal would successfully defend his title several times in August against Brown before finally losing the championship back to him at a house show in Greensville, NC on September 1. Following a match with Hector Guerrero on September 4, he departed for the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nWhile with the AWA and NWA, Regal's career appeared to be on the rise, but by 1985, the WWF roster was full of larger athletes and the primary focus was on brawling over science. Despite his talent, Regal essentially became a preliminary wrestler or jobber, the fate of many wrestlers at the time who could not catch on in the WWF without a colorful gimmick. Regal was still billed as \"Mr Electricity\", but did not have the supporting promotional vignettes that many of the other incoming wrestlers received who joined the WWF in the second half of 1986, such as Koko B. Ware, Billy Graham, Dick Slater, Outback Jack, or The Honky Tonk Man.\n\nRegal made his first WWF appearance on September 16, 1986 when he teamed with Terry Gibbs to take on The Junkyard Dog and George Steele in a match that would be televised on the October 11th edition of WWF Superstars. On September 22 he gained his first victory, pinning Jose Luis Rivera at Madison Square Garden. From this point onward however Regal was winless for several weeks, facing Nick Kiniski, Billy Jack Haynes, Dick Slater, and the Honky Tonk Man. He defeated Jerry Allen on October 22 in Richfield, OH and won a dark match at a WWF Superstars taping on October 28; these would be his last wins. His final match was a loss the following day to Tito Santana and Pedro Morales at Wrestling Challenge, after which he left the promotion.\n\nRegal returned to the NWA at an event in Peoria, IL on March 20, 1988. He faced and defeated Spike Huber, marking his first wrestling match since leaving the WWF.\n\nRegal joined the startup Windy City Wrestling promotion shortly afterwards and was crowned their World Heavyweight Champion. He would hold the title for an astounding 619 days, defending the belt against Jim Brunzell, Ken Patera, and Colonel DeBeers. After losing the title he continued to make appearances for WCW through 1995. His final appearance came in a disqualification victory against Jerry De Camillo on February 18, 1995 at a TV taping in Chicago. He retired in 1996.\n\nRegal is the son-in-law of legendary wrestler Wilbur Snyder. Currently he is an executive with General Motors in their vehicle remarketing division.\n\n\n"}

He is known for his works on China, and is the Arthur Ross Director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society in New York. He previously served as Dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nSchell's father Orville Hickok Schell, Jr., was a prominent lawyer who headed the New York City Bar Association, chaired the human rights group Americas Watch from its founding in 1981 until his death in 1987, co-founded Helsinki Watch, forerunner to Human Rights Watch, and became the namesake of the Orville H. Schell, Jr. Center for International Human Rights at Yale Law School. Orville Schell III is the older brother of writer Jonathan Schell.\n\nSchell attended Pomfret School in Pomfret, Connecticut, after which he attended Harvard University, leaving in 1960 after his junior year to study Chinese, first at Stanford University and then at National Taiwan University from 1961 to 1964. While in Taiwan, Schell began writing columns for the \"Boston Globe\" as its \"Man in Asia\". He then returned to Harvard and studied Asian history, culture and politics under John Fairbank and Edwin Reischauer, and completed his bachelor's degree in 1964.\n\nIn 1964-65 Schell worked for the Ford Foundation in Jakarta, Indonesia. He then pursued Chinese studies at the University of California, Berkeley, earning a master's degree in 1967, becoming researcher for sociology and history professor Franz Schurmann (head of the school's Center for Chinese Studies) on a three-volume work \"The China Reader\" (1967, Random House). Schell was named as a co-author, establishing him as a China scholar, expert and pundit on Asia.\n\nSchell continued his academic studies at University of California, Berkeley, completing all but his Ph.D. dissertation. As anti-Vietnam War protests shook the campus, he became involved in anti-war activism and journalism, and in 1967 he signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse to pay tax as a protest against the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1969 Schell and Schurmann co-founded Pacific News Service (PNS) to create and distribute news and commentary from a broader spectrum of voices, especially viewpoints from abroad. The PNS was critical of the United States role in Indochina during the Vietnam War and supportive of establishing diplomatic relations with the PRC.\n\nBefore his 1974 departure for China, Schell had already published three scholarly books, \"The China Reader\", \"Starting Over: A College Reader\" and \"Modern China: The Story of a Revolution\".\n\nIn 1975 Schell and his younger brother Jonathan Schell (who would later write the bestseller The Fate of the Earth, and join \"The Nation\" and the Nation Institute) became correspondents at \"The New Yorker\". Schell has also served as a correspondent for the \"Atlantic Monthly\" and the \"New Republic\". He has written widely for many other magazine and newspapers, including \"The New Yorker\", \"Time\" magazine, \"Harper's\", \"The Nation\", \"The New York Review of Books\", \"Wired\", \"Foreign Affairs\", \"Newsweek\", the \"China Quarterly\", and the \"New York Times\", \"Washington Post\" and \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nIn 1980 Schell won an Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship to research and write about the reliance on drugs in the U.S. meat industry.\n\nHe has also been a co-producer for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) production center WGBH-TV in Boston (1984), NBC Nightly News (1987), CBS' 60 Minutes (1991), and helped produce Peter Jennings' specials at ABC Television.

In 1997, Schell won a George Peabody Award for his production of Frontline's documentary Gate of Heavenly Peace.\n\nSchell's selection as Dean of the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism elicited one unusual attack from right-wing radio talk show host and health guru, Michael Savage, who alleged the head of the search committee, sociology professor Troy Duster, had refused to interview him. Savage considered himself a qualified conservative journalist for the job, and claimed that Schell's appointment constituted political patronage, which is illegal under California's labor laws. The suit also argued that a political litmus test for the deanship illegally denied public employment and First Amendment rights to a conservative applicant. The lawsuit was dropped as having little merit and when all conservative applicants withdrew from consideration.\n\nDuring his tenure at UC Berkeley, Schell was responsible for the hirings of Christopher Hitchens, Michael Lewis, Cynthia Gorney, Michael Pollan, Louis Rossetto, Charles Ferguson, Barbara Ehrenreich, Mark Danner, Steve Wasserman, Stephen Talbot and Tom Engelhardt, among others.\n\nIn April 2006, Schell announced his intention to resign as dean.\n\nSchell is now the Arthur Ross Director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society in New York, which focuses on multimedia journalism, original research and public events to bring attention to areas of mutual interest to the United States and China. Since its inception, the Center has focused primarily on issues of energy and global climate change. Schell is currently overseeing \"The China Boom Project\", \"On Thinner Ice\", a joint multimedia project with David Breashears' \"Glacier Research Imaging Project\" (GRIP) and MediaStorm, and a new policy effort to maximize American interest in response to investment from China.\n\nA frequent participant in the World Economic Forum, Schell is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, The Climate Policy Initiative, GE's Eco Imagination Advisory Board and the Council on the Future of Media, which claims to be \"championing a new global, independent news and information service whose role is to inform, educate and improve the state of the world-one that would take advantage of all platforms of content delivery from mobile to satellite and online to create a new global network\".\n\nSchell has criticized factory farming. In 1976 he published \"The Town That Fought to Save Itself\", about the San Francisco suburb of Bolinas, where he has a ranch. In 1978 he co-founded the company Niman Ranch (then named \"Niman-Schell\") with Bill Niman with the objective of raising cattle in a humane and environmentally sound manner. He left the company in 1999. In 1984 he published the book \"\", criticizing meat production in the United States.\n\nSchell first visited the People's Republic of China in 1974, during the last years of Mao Zedong. After Mao's death, Schell wrote: \"He conceived of the Chinese revolution, and then helped cause it to happen. And, in the process, the thought of Chairman Mao became inculcated in almost every Chinese. The word almost literally became flesh. And it seemed clear, even before Mao died, that his death could not erase the way in which he had almost become transubstantiated in his people.\"\n\nIn 2004 Schell called China's Communist-Capitalist mix \"Leninist capitalism\".\n\nIn an interview with Terri Gross of NPR's Fresh Air broadcast November 19, 2009, Schell stated that whether or not China's \"autocratic capitalism\" could deliver economic growth better than democracy was a question he faced \"with some trepidation.\" He suggests the Chinese form of government may be more adaptive than democracy because it is not encumbered by the special interest power blocks found in the United States, and can sometimes be able to act more decisively to deal with the complexities of the world of today, although it can also more quickly implement poor decisions. But, he emphasized that he personally preferred living in an open society.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Banu Khazraj and later became its leader. He was the first one who pledged of allegiance to the first caliph, Abu Bakr, in a meeting in Saqifa. He wisely handled the situation when there was a huge dispute and division on the matter of succession to Prophet.\n\nHe was among the early Muslims of Median from the clan of Banu Khazraj. When he reached in his mature age he became the chief of Banu Khazraj\n\nHe was a Companion who was present at the battle of Badr.\n\nHe became the chief of Banu Aus\n\nHe participated in the Battle of Badr. Muhammad's forces included Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali, Hamza, Mus`ab ibn `Umair, Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam, Ammar ibn Yasir, and Abu Dharr al-Ghifari. The Muslims also brought seventy camels and two horses, meaning that they either had to walk or fit three to four men per camel. However, many early Muslim sources indicate that no serious fighting was expected, and the future Caliph Uthman stayed behind to care for his sick wife Ruqayyah, the daughter of Muhammad. Salman the Persian also could not join the battle, as he was still not a free man.\n\nHe also led a military campaign as a commander known as the Expedition of Bashir Ibn Sa’d al-Ansari (Fadak). He was sent to Fadak, the event took place in Shaban, 7AH i.e. December 628 AD,3rd Month 7AH, of the Islamic Calendar.\n\nIt is mentioned in Seerat Ibn e Ishaq (the very first biography of Muhammad)) and subsequently Seerat Ibn e Hatham (another authentic biography of Muhammad)) and all other history and biography books that when Muhammad died, companions of Prophet were busy in their final rituals then they were informed that there is a gathering of Ansar of Medina. They are discussing succession after Prophet, and Sa'd ibn Ubadah chief of Khazraj clan is a strong candidate for succession of leadership. Fearing of civil war Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah instantly reached there, the situation was quite tense. Ansars were almost agreed on the khilafat of Sa'd ibn Ubadah, Muhajirs mainly above three shaikhs disagreed then Habab ibn Mundhir who was motivating the Ansars to take control of the city, suggested to appoint to two Khalifas, one from Ansars and other for Muhajirs and if Muhajirs don't agree on that term then \"take your swords and throw them out of Medina\". Then Bashir ibn Sa'ad who belonged to clan of Banu Aws, intervened and handled the flared up situation. He said, \"O Ansar you're the first who helped Prophet when His own people rejected him, now you should not be the first to destroy unity of Muslims after Him. And whatever you'he done for Islam you should seek its reward in afterlife and should not be divided on the issue of succession.\"\nAfter that Abu Bakr asked people to appoint as Khalifa either to Umar or Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah because both of them were Muhajirs from Quraysh, were among the very first who accepted Islam and were among the closest companions of Prophet. But Umar withdrew himself saying that he would never consider himself when Abu Bakr is present. Then Bashir ibn Sa'ad was the first one who pledged at the hand of Abu Bakr, then Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and after that all people at Saqifah followed them.\n\nHe was martyred at 'Ayn at-Tamr, as az-Zurqani mentioned.\n\n states:\n\n"}

It was originally based on St. Stephen's Green, moving in 1911 to a purpose-built \"Royal College of Science\" building on Merrion Street. In 1926 it was absorbed into University College Dublin (UCD) as the faculty of Science and Engineering.\n\nThe Museum of Economic Geology was founded by the Dublin Castle administration in 1845, with chemist Robert Kane as curator, and a focus on mining in Ireland similar to the Museum of Practical Geology in London. In 1847, Kane was promoted to director, expanding its remit, and renaming it the Museum of Irish Industry (MII). In 1853 a new Science and Art Department was created within the Whitehall administration, and in 1854 the MII placed under its remit. A School of Science applied to Mining and the Arts was created, modelled on the Royal School of Mines in London, with four professorships shared jointly by the MII school and the Royal Dublin Society (RDS). The MII and School shared premises at 51, St. Stephen's Green, acquired in 1846 and fitted out by 1852. In 1864, a select committee of the UK parliament recommended that the MII and School be entirely separated from the RDS and broadened into a government-supported College of Science for Ireland. In 1865, HM Treasury agreed and in 1867 a commission was appointed by the education committee of the Privy Council. The commission, headed by William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, outlined the scope and functions of the proposed college, and the RCScI mission statement on 11 September 1867 was: \n\nGeorge Sigerson complained in 1868 that the RCScI was less open to Catholics than the MII had been.\n\nThe RCScI's remit was later changed to exclude include agriculture and include \"Physics and Natural Science\". The number of students enrolled increased gradually.\n\nBy 1898 the RCScI had chairs of Mining and Mineralogy, Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, Botany, Geology, Applied Mathematics and Mechanism, Descriptive Geometry and Engineering. In 1900, control was transferred from the Science and Art Department in London to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Dublin, headed by Horace Plunkett. A new building was proposed in 1897 and a site from Merrion Street to Kildare Street was chosen in 1898; in 1899 the plan was extended to include government administrative offices as well as the new college. The new building was designed by Sir Aston Webb; the foundation stone was laid in 1904 by Edward VII and it was opened in 1911 by George V.\n\nIn 1926 the RCScI was absorbed into UCD where it became the UCD Science and Engineering faculties. Science moved to UCD's Earlsfort Terrace building, and on to Belfield in the 1960s; Engineering moved from Merrion Street to Belfield in 1989. The RCScI building was then absorbed into Government Buildings with the rest of Aston Webb's complex, lavishly renovated by Charles Haughey and used to house the Department of the Taoiseach.\n\n\n\n"}

The Rathore deduce their origin from the Rath (Spine) of Indra. Several sources claim the origin of the Rathore's from the Rashtrakuta dynasty. Some bards of Rajputana and Prithviraj Raso, also called the Rathore's descendants of the Gahadvalas, however the Gahadvala claims were of later origin, and their historical veracity is doubtful. Some historians like Vishuddhanand Pathak and Erskine agree to the Gahadvala origin of the Rathores. According to them the Gahadvalas themselves were an ofshoot of the Rashtrakuts and after the destruction of Kannauj by the Ghurids, the remaining Gahadvalas under the leadership of Rao Sheo migrated to Marwar and started calling themselves \"Rathores\". The Rathore rulers referred to themselves as the successors of the Rashtrakuta dynasty and tried to get an imperial status by this claim when they were at the height of their power in the 16th century. The Rathore clan stood high amongst the 36 Royal Rajput tribes and the Rathore cavalry was formerly known as the best in India. In terms of wealth and patronage for art, the Rathore rulers were second only to the Kachwahas of Amer. However unlike the Kachwahas, the Rathores did not enjoy the patronage of the Mughals, as they were often at war with them.\n\nSome of the Maratha clans claim to be of Rathore origin. However they claim descent from the Somavansha via the Rashtrakutans that belonged to Yaduvansha from Vrishni warrior Satyaki, unlike the Rajput Rathore's who claim descent from the Suryavansha. \n\nAlternative spellings include Rathaur or Rathor or Rathur or Rathod or Rathour or Rahtore.\n\nThe Rathore clan gradually spread to encompass all of Marwar and the various cadet branches founded states in Rajputana, Central India and Gujarat. At the time of India's independence in 1947, \"these nine Rathore States collectively brought to India territory not less than 60,000 square miles in area\".

{"id": "2253619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253619", "title": "Benson Syndicate", "text": "Benson Syndicate\n\nThe Benson Syndicate was an organized crime organization in the western United States which received contracts from the General Land Office (GLO) to perform land surveys of the public lands. It was led by, and named after, one John A Benson (1845–1910), a former school teacher, county surveyor and later a reputable deputy surveyor, Mineral Surveyor and Civil Engineer. \n\nThe syndicate operated from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, but was most active in California and was headquartered in San Francisco. Its tenure ran from about 1875 to 1898 and was at its peak from 1883 to 1886. In California alone, at least 40 individuals were known to be involved, and very probably more actually were. Its modus operandi was to generate false demand for public land surveys (see Public Land Survey System) using fictitious land patent applications, followed by contracting with the GLO for the survey of these lands. The surveys were then fraudulently executed, being either shoddy, incomplete or outright fictitious. These \"surveys\" were \"performed\" under contract to individual deputy surveyors, some of whom were not even aware that the surveying contracts existed in their names, having been induced by Benson to sign blank papers which were later turned into contracts and other legal documents without their knowledge.\n\nAt other times, people with minimal—or even no—surveying experience and/or lacking proper qualifications as deputy surveyors, performed the work without the contracted surveyor ever being physically present, which was patently illegal. Often, an area under contract was surveyed only to the extent that was necessary to create plausible, but fabricated, survey plats and field notes for the remainder of the area. Other times, entire contracted areas, usually consisting of several survey townships (36 square miles), were fabricated by syndicate members at the San Francisco office, with little or no work on the ground at all (see below).\n\nBenson's organization infiltrated into very high levels of the government, and syndicate members in governmental positions as well as members of congress made the group's schemes possible. For example, in California at least two Surveyors General in the 1880s approved numerous fraudulent survey results and approved requests for government payment that were 200 to 700 percent of the originally estimated survey cost, which the government paid.\n\nTheodore Wagner was especially notorious in this regard, and his appointment as California Surveyor General coincided with a large increase in the group's activities and power. Others approved contracts that had originally been rejected (after inspection by independent government examiners), without evidence or assurance that the surveys had been properly corrected or completed. Also, at least one such examiner in California was part of the syndicate, attempting to gain payment for some rejected surveys via bogus field \"examinations\" (which were themselves later rejected as fraudulent as the extent of the group's activities became known). Banks were also involved, providing the deposits and performance bonds required by the government, in exchange for a cut of the enormous profits generated. These banks later also paid for the syndicate's defense attorneys in trials brought by the government in its failed, ten year effort to convict the syndicate members and recover funds paid for fraudulent work.\n\nDetailed information on the Syndicate's history remains fairly sparse. Two \"Annual Reports of the Commissioner of the General Land Office\" provide a glimpse of the group's activities. The Report for 1887, pages 25–26, gives this summary of their schemes:\n\n\"\"In April last the United States grand jury at San Francisco returned forty one indictments for perjury and conspiracy in connection with fraudulent surveys of the public lands...The operations of this syndicate were not confined to California, but extended to the States of Nevada, Oregon and Colorado, and the Territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Washington. Its purpose was to control all surveying contracts in these States and Territories under the deposit system, to manufacture settlers' applications for surveys, to file in the offices of the surveyors-general fictitious field notes of surveys and alleged surveys, and to draw from the Treasury of the United States large sums of money on fraudulent surveying accounts.\"\"\n\n\"\"The principal portion of the contracts were let in the names of thirty-four alleged deputy surveyors, of whom three were \"dummies\", two were intimately connected with the surveyor-general who approved the bulk of the contracts, and the remainder were relatives, partners, associates, or employees of the head of the syndicate. There was paid to the order or purported order, of these thirty-four pretended deputy surveyors upwards of $1,000,000, all of which went into the treasury of the syndicate, the parties used as tools being paid stated salaries by the syndicate for the use of their names and services. Three of the alleged deputies, to whom upwards of $190,000 appears from official records to have been paid, have sworn that their names were used without their knowledge, that they never had a surveying contract, and never received the amounts shown as paid them, and one swears that he never did a day's work in his life at land surveying and knows nothing of the business.\"\"\n\n\"\"Every expedient known to legal ingenuity has been resorted to by defendants and their confederates to avoid and defeat trials on the indictments found, but it is hoped and expected that at the next term of the court the trial and merited conviction of guilty parties to this stupendous scheme of fraud, perjury, and public robbery which has been developed, will be secured.\"\"\n\nThe 1888 Report, pages 186-187, provides this description of one fictitious survey of three survey townships in the high Sierra Nevada, southeast of what is now Yosemite National Park:\n\n\"\"Township 7 South, Range 25 East and Township 8 South, Ranges 24 and 25 East, Mount Diablo Meridian: These townships are very rough, intersected by deep canyons and very steep, almost impassable mountains, in part covered with dense chaparral. Six weeks before the deputy claims to have commenced his surveys, all the people who live there in the summer are driven out by the snows, all business is suspended, and the mountain country abandoned. A comparison of the \"original\" field notes, transcript notes, plats and report of the examiner, shows that at the season of the year (from December 1, 1884 to January 3, 1885) when the deputy pretends to have made the surveys, the deep snows made the survey at that time impossible; that in the original notes (which are now in this office) much is omitted that is found in the transcripts and data supplied from memory, or rather \"made up\"; that disregarding clerical errors the transcripts are not in any sense copies of the original notes; that triangulations omitted in originals are audaciously given in detail in the transcripts, just as if they had really been made in the field, that the high speed, more than 6 miles per day, at which it is pretended the work was executed, surpasses belief when we take into consideration the nature of the ground, and bear in mind that the surveying was done during the shortest days of the year; that the deputy gives descriptions of erroneous bearing trees where no such trees, either as regards size or species, are to be found; that in the face of all the embarrassing conditions, big canyons, high and steep mountains, deep snow, impenetrable chaparral, precipices impossible to ascend or descend, the deputy with his \"two\" parties of \"four\" men each, \"frequently with the impassable San Joaquin river between\" them, pretends to have subdivided T8SR24E at the rate of more than 6 miles per day, and then accomplishes the feat of \"recording all this work\" in \"one\" field book. The conclusion is that the deputy did not make the surveys of these townships according to his field notes and that the notes are in large part fictitious and fraudulent\".\"\n\nIt was completely implausible survey results such as these, as well as the sworn testimony of disenchanted employees or associates, that led to the recognition of the widespread fraud of Benson's group. Beginning about 1886, contracts held by certain surveyors thought to be aligned with Benson were not paid by the government, leading to various lawsuits. In 1887, forty one federal indictments for conspiracy and perjury were brought against Benson and several others, as mentioned in the Report quote above. However the trials, in federal district court, did not even occur until 1892, and when they did all were found innocent on legal technicalities. However their actual guilt was clear to everyone familiar with the facts, and surveyors associated with Benson had difficulty getting work. Because of this, Benson proposed what came to be known as the \"Benson Compromise\" in 1895 to the California Surveyor General, which proposed to correct or finish the survey work on several contracts that had never been paid out because government examiners had declared the work bogus. This compromise was accepted by the government, but little of this supposedly \"corrected\" work is reported to have ever been accepted by the Surveyor General as valid.\n\n\n"}

He may have been a native of Bokeham, now Bookham, in Surrey, or of Buckenham in Norfolk and derived his name from either place. In a concluding note to his \"Lives of the Saints\", he is described as a \"Suffolke man, frere Austyn of Stoke Clare\" (friar at Clare Priory in Suffolk). He travelled in Italy on at least two occasions, possibly living for a time in Venice and Rome, and in 1445 was a pilgrim to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.\n\nBokenam wrote a series of thirteen legends of holy maidens and women. These are written chiefly in seven and eight-lined stanzas, and nine of them are preceded by prologues. Bokenam was a follower of Chaucer and Lydgate, and doubtless had in mind Chaucer's \"Legend of Good Women\". His chief, but by no means his only, source was the \"Legenda Aurea\" of Jacobus de Voragine, archbishop of Genoa, whom he cites as \"Januence\". The first of the legends, \"Vita S[an]c[t]ae Margaretae, virginis et martyris\", was written for his friend, Thomas Burgh, a Cambridge monk. Others are dedicated to pious ladies who desired the history of their name-saints.\n\nThe \"Arundel MS. 327\" (in the British Museum) is a unique copy of Bokenam's work; it was finished, according to the concluding note, in 1447, and presented by the scribe, Thomas Burgh, to an unnamed convent \"that the nuns may remember him and his sister, Dame Betrice Burgh.\"\n\nThe poems were edited (1835) for the Roxburghe Club with the title \"Lyvys of Seyntys\"..., and by Dr. Carl Horstmann as \"Osbern Bokenams Legenden\" (Heilbronn, 1883), in Eugen Kölbing's \"Altengl. Bibliothek\", vol. i. Both editions include a dialogue written in Latin and English taken from William Dugdale's \"Monasticon Anglicanum\" (ed. 1846, vol. vi, p. 1600); this is a dialogue between a \"Secular asking and a Frere answerynge at the grave of Dame Johan of Acres shewith the lyneal descent of the lordis of the honore of Clare fro ... MCCXLVIII to ... MCCCLVI\". Bokenam wrote, as he tells us, plainly, in the Suffolk speech. He explains his lack of decoration on the plea that the finest flowers had been already plucked by Chaucer, Gower and Lydgate.\n\nIn 2004 a manuscript copy of Bokenam's version of the Legenda Aurea was discovered in the library of Abbotsford House, Scotland. It had been purchased in 1809 by Sir Walter Scott and subsequently forgotten.\n\n\n"}

An orchestrated version of the song conducted by George Martin appears on the North American version of the album, \"A Hard Day's Night Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\".\n\n\"I Should Have Known Better\" was one of several songs written and recorded specifically for the Beatles' debut movie, \"A Hard Day's Night\". The harmonica-driven arrangement by the group was similar to that heard on Frank Ifield's recording of \"The Wayward Wind\", a hit on the UK Singles Chart in March 1963. The Beatles were fans of Ifield and his music, and had notably covered his recording of \"I Remember You\" in their Hamburg stage act in 1962.\n\nThe first recording session for the song was on 25 February 1964 at EMI Studios when three takes were attempted, but only one was complete. Take 2 was aborted when Lennon broke into hysterics over his harmonica playing. The song was re-recorded the next day after making some changes to the arrangement.\n\nLennon's harmonica playing opens the track, the last occasion the Beatles were to feature this instrument on an intro (\"I'm a Loser\", recorded 14 August 1964 has a harmonica solo) and thus draws a line under a significant period of their early music. The song's middle sixteen section features George Harrison's brand new Rickenbacker 360/12 12-string guitar.\n\nThe mono and stereo versions have slightly different harmonica introductions. In the stereo version, the harmonica drops out briefly. Also, a noticeably clumsy and audible tape edit is heard during the second chorus between \"You're gonna say you love me too, oh,\" and \"And when I ask you to be mine.\"\n\nIn the UK, \"I Should Have Known Better\" appeared on \"A Hard Day's Night\" and was released on 10 July 1964. It was not released as a single at that time. In 1976, it was released as a B-side to \"Yesterday\".\n\nIn the US, \"I Should Have Known Better\" was released on 13 July 1964 as the B-side to \"A Hard Day's Night\" and reached number 53 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and number 43 on the \"Cash Box\" chart.\n\nAs part of the film contract, United Artists acquired album rights for the American market. The company released a soundtrack album on 26 June 1964 with eight Beatles songs and four instrumentals. \"I Should Have Known Better\" was performed in the film, and it appears on the soundtrack. Capitol Records released \"Something New\" a month later with songs from the UK version of \"A Hard Day's Night\" that were not used in the film. The songs were also later released by Capitol on the \"Hey Jude\" compilation album in 1970.\n\n\"I Should Have Known Better\" was released as a single in a number of continental European countries, including Norway, where it reached number one, and West Germany, where it reached number six. In Sweden, the song topped the Kvällstoppen Chart for four weeks.\n\n\nThe song is performed in the train compartment scene of \"A Hard Day's Night\". It was in fact filmed in a van, with crew members rocking the vehicle to simulate the action of a train in motion. Paul McCartney is seen lip-syncing in the song, both in the train scene and in the live performance at the end of the film, despite not singing in the actual recording.\n\n"}

Written primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney. \"That's my first attempt at a ballad proper. ... It shows that I wrote sentimental love ballads way back when\", Lennon stated in his 1980 \"Playboy\" interview. Paul McCartney stated that he contributed to the song: \"We wrote 'If I Fell' together.\"\n\nThe song opens with an unrepeated introductory section sung by Lennon, followed by a standard \"Tin Pan Alley\" AABA form. Each verse preceding the B section (a.k.a. Bridge or Middle Eight) has a slightly different ending which creates a seamless transition between the two. The demo version (just John alone on acoustic guitar) from early 1964, does include the introduction, as well as an alternative ending. The remainder of the song features a two-part harmony, with Lennon singing the lower harmony while McCartney sings the higher one. It also features Lennon's intricate chord changes. The key changes from D flat minor to D major at the end of the introduction, which is played with a series of descending barre chords). The rest of the composition uses mainly open chords, including an unusual D ninth.\n\nLennon and McCartney shared a single microphone \"for their Everly Brothers-like close harmonies.\"\n\nLike much of the Beatles' early work, the song was released in two different mixes for mono and stereo. Lennon's opening vocal is single-tracked in mono but double-tracked in the stereo mix.\n\n\"If I Fell\" was a part of the Beatles repertoire during their US and Canadian tour in 1964. The group typically performed the song faster than the studio version, and Lennon and McCartney often sang it with barely suppressed laughter. On more than one occasion it was introduced as \"If I Fell Over\".\n\n\"If I Fell\" was released as the B-side of the US single \"And I Love Her\" on Capitol 5235. As the B-side, it reached number 53 on the Billboard Hot 100. It reached number 28 in Canada. The song was also released as a single in Norway, where it hit number one.\n\nIn the UK, it was released on 4 December 1964 as the A-side of a single (b/w \"Tell Me Why\") on Parlophone DP 562. The single was intended for export, but some retailers sold it in the UK anyway. It did not chart there and is generally not considered an \"official\" UK single.\n\n\nPersonnel per Ian MacDonald\n\n\n"}

His father was the armatolos of the Valtos district, Dimitris Iskos or \"Karaiskos\", his mother Zoe Dimiski (from Arta, Greece, who was also the niece of a local monastery abbot) and cousin of Gogos Bakolas, captain of the armatoliki of Radovitsi. He was of Sarakatsani descent.\n\nAt a very early age he became a klepht in the service of Katsantonis, a famous local Agrafiote brigand captain. He excelled as a klepht — agile, cunning, brave and reckless — and rose quickly through the ranks, eventually becoming a \"protopalikaro\", or lieutenant.\n\nAt the age of fifteen he was captured by the troops of Ali Pasha and imprisoned at Ioannina, where close to Ali Pasha he learned Albanian. Ali Pasha, impressed by Karaiskakis’s courage and intelligence, and sensing his worth as a fighter, released him from prison and put him in the care of his personal bodyguards. He served as a bodyguard to Ali Pasha for a few years, before losing favour with the Ottoman warlord and fleeing into the mountains to continue his life as a klepht.\n\nDuring the early stages of the war, Karaiskakis served in the army of Ali Pasha in his war against the Ottomans. After the defeat of Ali Pasha, in 1822, the Ottomans made him armatolos of Agrafa, but he soon broke with them and joined the Greek case.\n\nKaraiskakis served in the militia in the Morea (Peloponnese), where he participated in the intrigues that divided the Greek leadership. Nonetheless, he recognized the necessity of providing Greece with a stable government and was a supporter of Ioannis Kapodistrias who would later become Greece's first head of state.\n\nKaraiskakis's reputation grew during the middle and latter stages of the war. He helped to lift the second siege of Missolonghi in 1823, and did his best to save the town from its third siege in 1826.\n\nThat same year (1826), he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Greek revolutionary forces in Rumeli, achieving a mixed response: while failing to cooperate effectively with other leaders of the independence movement or with the foreign sympathizers fighting alongside the Greeks, he gained some military successes against the Ottomans.\n\nHis most famous victory was at Arachova, where his army together with other revolutionary leaders, crushed a force of Turkish and Albanian troops under Mustafa Bey and Kehagia Bey. Victories such as the one at Arachova were especially welcome amid the disasters that were occurring elsewhere.\n\nIn 1827, Karaiskakis participated in the failed attempt to raise the siege of Athens, and attempted to prevent the massacre of the Ottoman garrison stationed in the convent of Saint Spyridon in Piraeus.\n\nHe was killed in action on his Greek name day, 23 April 1827, after being fatally wounded by a rifle bullet during the Battle of Phaleron. According to Karaiskakis's expressed desire to be buried on the island of Salamis when he died, he was buried at the church of Saint Dimitrios on Salamis.\n\nKing Otto of Greece posthumously conferred Karaiskakis the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer.\n\nKaraiskakis was famous among the fighters of the revolution for his tirade manner of speaking.\n\nKaraiskaki Stadium in Neo Faliro, Piraeus is named after him as he was mortally wounded in the area.\n\nDionysis Savvopoulos has written both music and lyrics to the popular Greek song \"Ode to Georgios Karaiskakis\" (). Savvopoulos wrote the song for Che Guevara, but he chose this title to pass the censorship of the Greek military junta.\n\nKaraiskakis was married to Engolpia Skylodimou, and had three children: daughters Pinelopi and Eleni, and the only son Spyridon.\n\nSitsa Karaiskaki, a writer of the Interwar period, known for her pro-nazi beliefs, was also his descendant. She left Greece for Vienna with other collaborators after the Axis withdrawal in 1944, but returned later.\n\n\n"}

Years later, McCartney described it as a \"formula song\", and Lennon said, \"I would never have sung it myself.\"\n\nFeaturing a hectic style rhythm guitar in juxtaposition with Harrison's placid vocal, its composers give it an unexpected choice of chord at the crux of its chorus, augmenting the B7th on \"I'm happy just to \"dance\" with you\".
