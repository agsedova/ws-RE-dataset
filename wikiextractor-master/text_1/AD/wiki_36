Although not trained as a potter and never technically superior (his works, large and small, frequently exhibit cracking), the power of his vision of a modern Australia that embraces Aboriginal spirituality and respect for the natural world was his general message throughout his artworks.\n\nHis major works include the \"Dromana\" in the Seawinds Garden, Arthurs Seat, Victoria, and \"Gun Brute\" at the William Ricketts Sanctuary, Mount Dandenong, Victoria. Many smaller works are in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. Photographic records of his sculptures, particularly those from the sanctuaries of Pitchi Richi and Mount Dandenong, which have been vandalised, are held in the archives of Australia's libraries. Ricketts, never rich, supported himself through commissioned sales of his art and made pieces as gifts. These signed original small pieces are increasingly sought after for private collections.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1960 he made frequent trips into Central Australia to live with Pitjantjatjara and Arrernte Aboriginal Australians, whose traditions and culture inspired his sculpture. He was not an Aboriginal by blood but considered himself adopted by the Pitjantjatjara nation. He left many of his central Australian works at Pitchi Richi near Alice Springs – a bird sanctuary run by his friend Leo Corbet – as he considered the landscape integral to these sculptures.\n\nFrom 1912 to 1920 Ricketts developed skills in playing violin, crafting jewellery, and clay modelling. In 1934 he started his major artistic work, creating the sculpture park now named William Ricketts Sanctuary. He worked on this project until his death in 1993. In the 1970s, he spent two years in India, mostly at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram spiritual center in Puducherry, developing spiritual empathy with Indian people and knowledge of their philosophy.\n\nRicketts' major work is in the sculpture park that he named Potter's sanctuary, but which is now known as William Ricketts Sanctuary. In the 1960s the Government of Victoria bought the Sanctuary from Ricketts, and made it a public park. Ricketts lived there until his death in 1993.\n\n"}

(He had another child who also danced ballet, Paul Taglioni.) Also, although August Bournonville's version is better known, it was Taglioni who was the original choreographer of \"La Sylphide\", in 1832.\n\nBorn in Milan to father Carlo, he received his dance training predominantly with Carlo Blasis and Jean-François Coulon. He made his dancing debut at age 17 in Pisa performing female roles. He danced in other Italian cities before becoming a dancer (at age 22) with the Paris Opera. With Vestris firmly in control there, he readily accepted an invitation to be a principal dancer and ballet master for the Royal Swedish Ballet in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nIn Stockholm, he married the dancer Sophie Karsten, daughter of a famous Swedish opera singer Christoffer Christian Karsten and the Polish actress Sophie Stebnowska, in 1803. Together, they had two children, Marie Taglioni and Paul Taglioni, both of whom became dancers themselves.\n\nFor several years the family lived in Vienna and Germany but to escape the dangers of the Napoleonic wars, Filippo moved them to Paris. He danced and choreographed throughout Europe, mostly in Italy, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. Finally, he was invited to take a more permanent position with the Theater am Kärntnertor in Vienna.\n\nOnce settled in Vienna, he sent for Marie, who had been studying ballet in Paris. Upon her arrival, Filippo was discouraged by her artistic progress and began training her himself. He had her practice ballet six hours a day for six months, using a level method of technique training. He was very strict with her, and had no sympathy for her aching and bleeding toes. He sought to make her style light and delicate, with an emphasis on jumps with \"ballon\" and pointe work, something that was unheard of before this time. When she was ready he took her back to Paris.\n\nAfter Marie's professional debut she became so popular that Filippo was able to negotiate a six-year contract for the two of them. The triumphant première of \"La Sylphide\" on 12 March 1832, made her the most acclaimed prima ballerina of the Romantic period and him the most renowned choreographer of the day. It is said that the great Romantic period of dance was ushered in on that night. Because of this immense success, the two of them traveled widely together and toured both Europe and Russia.\n\nAs he grew older, he became eccentric and unpredictable, and eventually lost all of Marie's carefully amassed fortune in unwise speculations. Nevertheless, he must be recognized as a pioneer in a ballet style that was to alter forever the very nature of the art.\n\nTaglioni died in Como, Italy on 5 February 1871, at the age of 93.\n\nThe ballet-going public knows the Romantic ballet \"La Sylphide\" as being choreographed by the Danish ballet master August Bournonville. That is indeed the \"La Sylphide\" audiences are most familiar with today but was not the version given in 1832.\n\nThe original production of \"La Sylphide\" was first presented by the Paris Opera Ballet at the Salle Le Peletier in 1832, and was choreographed by Filippo Taglioni himself to the music of Jean Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer, with libretto by Adolphe Nourrit after a story by Charles Nodier. The leading roles were danced by Marie Taglioni and Joseph Mazilier.\n\nBournonville originally intended to stage the 1832 version in Denmark, but the Paris Opéra demanded too high a price for the orchestral parts of Schneitzhoeffer's score. In light of this, Bournonville decided to stage his own version of \"La Sylphide\" on the same scenario, with a new score by Herman Severin Løvenskiold. The production premiered in 1836 with the prodigy Lucile Grahn and Bournonville in the principal roles. Due to the strong tradition of the Royal Danish Ballet this version is still being performed in Denmark to this day, and has since been staged throughout the world.\n\nIn 1972 the ballet master Pierre Lacotte revived Filippo Talgioni's original \"La Sylphide\" for the Paris Opera Ballet, with the noted ballerina Ghislaine Thesmar as the Sylph. Schneitzhoeffer's original score was reconstructed from a manuscript held at the Bibliothèque nationale de France. As Taglioni's original choreography was lost long ago, Lacotte choreographed the ballet in the style of the epoch. The Paris Opera Ballet has since released the production onto DVD/video twice.\n\n1830: \"Le dieu et la bayadère\"\n\n1832: \"La Sylphide\"\n\n1833: \"La révolte au sérail\" \n\n1836: \"La fille du Danube\"\n\n1838: \"La gitana\"\n\n1839: \"L'ombre\"\n\n1840: \"Le Lac des fées\"\n\n1841: \"Aglaë, ou L'Elève de l'amour\"\n1852 : \"Satanella oder Metamorphosen\" based on \"The Devil in Love (novel)\"\n\n\n"}

The band recorded two full-length albums and a single, and contributed to several compilation albums.\n\nBrownstein, Albee and CJ Phillips (James) came together to form Excuse 17, a band that lasted only a few years would proved to be influential. Brownstein and Albee both played guitar and sang and CJ played the drums. The band quickly recorded a demo tape and then began recording for various compilations on independent record labels. Their first full-length recording, \"Excuse Seventeen\", was released jointly on Atlas Records (LP) and the queercore label Chainsaw Records (CD). They released a second and final album, \"Such Friends Are Dangerous\", on the indie label Kill Rock Stars in 1995, which displayed a boost in recording quality.\n\nThe band often played shows with Heavens to Betsy, including touring, not surprisingly since both bands were an active part of the riot grrrl scene. They also both appear on the compilation LP/CD \"Free to Fight\". Corin Tucker from Heavens to Betsy struck up a friendship with Brownstein and they dated for a time. They decided to form Sleater-Kinney, a side project that soon evolved into their main focus as their respective groups ended. However, Excuse 17's recordings are still valued by fans of Sleater-Kinney, those interested in riot grrrl and queercore recordings, and record collectors in general: \"Such Friends Are Dangerous\" was named one of the fifty best indie rock albums of the Pacific Northwest by online music magazine \"Pitchfork\". Albee also recorded with Tucker as Heartless Martin, releasing a cassette on Chainsaw Records in 1993.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of Excuse 17, Albee has built a successful career in visual art. Her work has been praised by publications including \"Bomb\", \"Tom Tom\", \"Artforum\", and \"Aperture\". Her papers are being preserved by the Fales Library at New York University.

His diplomatic background and choice of capable reporters helped to revive the paper's reputation for international news.\n\nChenery was born in Barbados to John Chenery, a West Indies merchant. He was educated at Eton and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Immediately after taking an ordinary degree in 1854, he was recruited by Mowbray Morris to work for \"The Times\", and was sent to Istanbul. On arrival in March 1854, he soon proved himself an excellent diplomatic correspondent, covering the Crimean War, mainly from Istanbul, but occasionally from the front, where he relieved William Howard Russell. It was while he was in Istanbul that Chenery met Percy Smythe, who sparked his interest in philological studies, a field in which he would later gain prominence.\n\nAfter the war, Chenery returned to London, where he served as a leader writer for \"The Times\" for many years, while continuing his Oriental studies. Among the languages he spoke were Arabic, Hebrew, modern Greek, and Turkish. He was one of the panelists involved in preparing the Old Testament portion of the Revised Version of the Bible. Chenery's translation of the first 26 chapters of the Arabic classic \"The Assemblies of Al-Hariri\" led to an appointment as Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford, where he also served as secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nIn 1877 John Walker selected Chenery as John Thadeus Delane's successor as editor of \"The Times\". He was then an experienced publicist, particularly well versed in Oriental affairs, and an indefatigable worker with a rapid and comprehensive judgment, although he lacked Delane's sociability and intuition for public opinion. Nonetheless, he introduced a number of innovations, bringing in more writers with scholarly backgrounds to employ their respective expertise. His background as a diplomatic correspondent and his choice of capable reporters for foreign postings revived the paper's reputation for international news coverage.\n\nDespite his position as editor, Chenery was unable to prevent the increasingly partisan slant of the paper imposed by Walter, a member of the Conservative Party. This shift was furthered in 1880 by the appointment of George Earle Buckle, Walter's hand-picked candidate, as assistant editor. Buckle assumed more duties in 1883 as ill health reduced Chenery's ability to play an active role as editor, though he continued in the post until his death on 11 February 1884.\n\nHe is buried in Brompton Cemetery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2231336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231336", "title": "Lucin Cutoff", "text": "Lucin Cutoff\n\nThe Lucin Cutoff is a 102-mile (164 km) railroad line in Utah which runs from Ogden to its namesake in Lucin. The most prominent feature of the cutoff was a 12-mile (19 km) long railroad trestle crossing the Great Salt Lake, in use from 1904 until the late 1950s, and since replaced by a rock and dirt causeway. The cutoff was originally built by the Southern Pacific Railroad as a means of shortening the First Transcontinental Railroad. Today the cutoff is owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad as a significant part of the Lakeside Subdivision, which runs from Ogden to Wells, Nevada, and is one of the many subdivisions of the Overland Route. Due to the obstruction of waterflow caused by the Lucin Cutoff, the Great Salt Lake appears to be different colors in aerial photographs; water north of the Cutoff appears brown, while water south of the Cutoff is more green.\n\nBuilt by the Southern Pacific Company (SP) between February 1902 and March 1904, the cutoff bypassed the original Central Pacific Railroad route through Promontory Summit where the Golden spike was driven in 1869. By going west across the lake from Ogden to Lucin, it cut 44 miles (71 km) off the original route and also significantly decreased curvature and grades. Built under the direction of SP chief engineer William Hood, a team of 3,000 SP workers worked seven days a week to build the line.\n\nWhen the line opened, it included short causeways extending from the western shore of the lake and the edge of Promontory Point, connected with a nearly 12-mile (19 km) long wooden trestle. The cutoff also included a causeway which spanned Bear River Bay from the eastern shore of the lake to Promontory Point. This section included a 600-foot-long trestle to allow Bear River water to flow into the lake.\n\nBy 1908, five passenger trains and seven freight trains were using the Lucin Cutoff in each direction daily. In 1942, the original line was removed between Lucin and Corinne, Utah — with the last Promontory spikes pulled up and the scrap metal donated to the war effort.\n\nIn 1944 the cutoff was the site of a train wreck in which 48 people were killed.\n\nThe trestle was functionally replaced in the late 1950s with a parallel dirt and rock causeway built under contract by the Morrison Knudsen construction company. The trestle remained in limited use alongside the causeway, until about 1975. The railroad eventually sold salvage rights to the trestle and Cannon Structures, Inc., through its Trestlewood division, began to dismantle it in the early 1990s. Trestlewood continues to market and sell the salvaged trestle wood.\n\nThe causeway would prevent lake water from flowing as freely as the open trestle had, and to help mitigate effects two culverts were included in the original causeway construction. The culverts would allow for boat traffic, and a limited amount of water to flow from the lake's southern arm (where surrounding freshwater rivers emptied into the lake) into the lake's northern arm.\n\nIn the early 1980s Utah experienced heavy flooding, and much of the extra water along the Wasatch Front flowed into the Great Salt Lake. This resulted in the lake experiencing historic high water levels and flooding nearby landowners. To aid the two culverts in channeling water to the northern arm, the State of Utah constructed a 300-foot-long bridge at the western end of the causeway. The state breached the causeway under the new bridge on August 1, 1984, allowing pent-up water from the southern arm to flow into the northern arm.\n\nThe continual slow sinking of the causeway has on occasion required more material to raise its height above the lake level. During the flooding of the 1980s, this buildup included placing 1,430 surplus railcars along the northern edge of the causeway and filling them with rock to act as gabions (this feature is known as the \"Boxcar Seawall.\")\n\nIn March 2011, Union Pacific Railroad (UP), the successor to the Southern Pacific, requested permission to close the two 1950s-era culverts because of damage related to age and a sinking of the causeway into the lake bed. The two culverts were closed in 2012 and 2013. To mitigate the effects of closing the two culverts, the railroad was required to build a bridge and breach the causeway under that bridge. Construction of a 180-foot-long bridge was completed in fall 2016, although the railroad agreed to delay opening the breach for a few months, due to environmental and water level concerns. The causeway was breached beneath the 180-foot bridge on December 1, 2016. Since the opening of the causeway the level of the water in the arms of the lake have begun to equalize. As of April 30, 2017, the level of the lake in the northern arm is within a foot of the southern arm.\n\n"}

Pennebaker that documents the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967. Among Pennebaker's several camera operators were fellow documentarians Richard Leacock and Albert Maysles. The painter Brice Marden has an \"assistant camera\" credit, and Bob Neuwirth, who figured prominently in Pennebaker's Bob Dylan documentary \"Dont Look Back\", acted as stage manager. Titles for the film were by the illustrator Tomi Ungerer. Featured performers include Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, Hugh Masekela, Otis Redding, Ravi Shankar, the Mamas & the Papas, the Who and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, whose namesake set his guitar on fire, broke it on the stage, then threw the neck of his guitar in the crowd at the end of \"Wild Thing\".\n\nIn 2018, the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nSongs featured in the film, in order of appearance:\n\nThe order of performances in the film was rearranged from the order of appearance at the festival. Additionally many artists who appeared at the festival were not included in the original cut of the film.\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company put up a $200,000 advance to get a film made about it for its new ABC Movie of the Week series. However, \"Monterey Pop\" never aired on ABC, a decision made by Thomas W. Moore, the head of ABC at the time and, according to Lou Adler, \"a very conservative Southern gentleman.\" \"We showed him Jimi Hendrix fornicating with his amp and we said 'What do you think?' \" Adler recalls. \"And he said 'Keep the money and get out.' He said 'Not on my network.' \" \n\n\"Monterey Pop\" was shot on 16mm film blown up to 35mm for theatrical release. Director D.A. Pennebaker said he recorded the audio on a professional 8-channel reel-to-reel recorder borrowed from the Beach Boys. The movie's theatrical release used a four-channel soundtrack that included two to three minutes of rudimentary surround sound. Dolby noise reduction was added in 1978 when fresh prints of the film were struck.\n\nAfter Leacock-Pennebaker, the original production company, was dissolved in 1970, Pennebaker Associates acquired rights to the film.\n\nWhen Sony Video released \"Monterey Pop\" on videocassette in 1986, Pennebaker created three one-inch tape masters struck from a 16mm negative he had \"wet-gated\", a process in which sponges remove particles and also place a fast-drying chemical on the film that fills in scratches. In a digital remix for the video, Pennebaker eliminated the surround track of the theatrical release and mixed the center dialog track into the left and right stereo channels. No Dolby was used, although Sony's initial video release inadvertently stated otherwise on the packaging.\n\nIn 2002 \"Monterey Pop\" was released on DVD as part of a Criterion Collection box set, \"The Complete Monterey Pop Festival\", that also includes Pennebaker's short films \"Jimi Plays Monterey\" (1986) and \"Shake! Otis at Monterey\" (1986), as well as two hours of outtake performances, including some by bands not seen in the original film. The box set was re-released in 2009 on Blu-ray. For this edition, the soundtracks were remixed in 5.1 Surround Sound by Eddie Kramer.\n\nRock critic Robert Christgau considers \"Monterey Pop\" the best of the 1960s concert documentaries, saying, \"[T]he music and its... celebrants are like a wonderful secret — wonderful because even though everyone knows about it, it still delivers the thrill of discovery. Unveiled in 1968, Pennebaker's vision of the 1967 event was instrumental in convincing potential organizers and participants that music was the healthiest way to crystallize the energy of a counterculture that by then seemed both blessedly inevitable and dangerously embattled.\"\n\nFrench New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard was so taken with Jefferson Airplane's performance in \"Monterey Pop\" that later in 1968 he set out to make a never-finished film titled \"One A.M.\" (for \"One American Movie\") in collaboration with Pennebaker and Leacock. Godard shot a sequence of the Airplane, (included on the 2004 \"Fly Jefferson Airplane\" DVD), playing at high noon on a business day on the roof of a New York hotel across the street from the Leacock-Pennebaker offices, with the tower of Rockefeller Center in the background. Attracted by the extremely high volume of the music, the police arrived and put an end to the shooting.\n\nThe screening of \"Monterey Pop\" in theaters helped raise the festival to mythic status, rapidly swelled the ranks of would-be festival-goers looking for the next festival, and inspired new entrepreneurs to stage more and more of them around the country.\n\nIn 1969, Michael Lang and Artie Kornfeld pitched an idea for a recording studio in Woodstock, New York to businessmen John P. Roberts and Joel Rosenman. In the documentary \"Woodstock: Now and Then\", Rosenman said the proposal suggested that the studio would encourage occasional rock concerts in the town. Rosenman had watched \"Monterey Pop\" the day before meeting with Lang and Kornfeld and, impressed by the film, agreed, with Roberts to bankroll Lang and Kornfeld in an effort that morphed into the 1969 Woodstock Festival.\n\n"}

Opening and maintaining a database connection for each user, especially requests made to a dynamic database-driven website application, is costly and wastes resources. In connection pooling, after a connection is created, it is placed in the pool and it is used again so that a new connection does not have to be established. If all the connections are being used, a new connection is made and is added to the pool. Connection pooling also cuts down on the amount of time a user must wait to establish a connection to the database.\n\nWeb-based and enterprise applications use an application server to handle connection pooling. Dynamic web pages without connection pooling open connections to database services as required and close them when the page is done servicing a particular request. Pages that use connection pooling, on the other hand, maintain open connections in a pool. When the page requires access to the database, it simply uses an existing connection from the pool, and establishes a new connection only if no pooled connections are available. This reduces the overhead associated with connecting to the database to service individual requests.\n\nLocal applications that need frequent access to databases can also benefit from connection pooling. Open connections can be maintained in local applications that don't need to service separate remote requests like application servers, but implementations of connection pooling can become complicated. A number of available libraries implement connection pooling and related SQL query pooling, simplifying the implementation of connection pools in database-intensive applications.\n\nAdministrators can configure connection pools with restrictions on the numbers of minimum connections, maximum connections and idle connections to optimize the performance of pooling in specific problem contexts and in specific environments.\n\nConnection pooling is supported by IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j.\n\n"}

They are normally made from a dried-out gourd, \"Lagenaria siceraria\", although other species, such as \"Nepenthes mirabilis\", are also used. They are held in place by a small loop of fiber attached to the base of the koteka and placed around the scrotum. There is a secondary loop placed around the chest or abdomen and attached to the main body of the koteka.\n\nMen choose kotekas similar to ones worn by other men in their cultural group. For example, Yali men favour a long, thin koteka, which helps hold up the multiple rattan hoops worn around their waist. Men from Tiom wear a double gourd, held up with a strip of cloth, and use the space between the two gourds for carrying small items such as money and tobacco.\n\nIt is traditional clothing in certain New Guinea highlands societies including in the Grand Baliem Valley of Western New Guinea and the Ok Tedi and Telefomin regions of Papua New Guinea. It is worn without other clothing, tied in upward position.\n\nMany tribes can be identified by the way they wear their koteka. Some wear them pointed straight out, straight up, at an angle, or in other directions. The diameter of the koteka can also be a clue. Contrary to popular belief, there is little correlation between the size or length of the koteka and the social status of the wearer. Kotekas of different sizes serve different purposes: very short kotekas are worn when working and longer and more elaborate kotekas are worn on festive occasions. The koteka is made of a specially grown gourd. Stone weights are tied to the bottom of the gourd to stretch it out as it grows. Curves can be made in it by the use of string to restrain its growth in whatever direction the grower wishes. They can be quite elaborately shaped in this manner. When harvested, the gourd is emptied and dried. It is sometimes waxed with beeswax or native resins. It can be painted, or have shells, feathers and other decorations attached to it.\n\nSociolinguistically and politically today, the term \"koteka\" is used as a name of tribal groups across the highlands of New Guinea, in both West Papua and Papua New Guinea. For example, in West Papua today, there is an Assembly of Koteka Tribes. The term \"koteka\" was never used to identify a society or ethnic group before, but it is now commonly known for a tribal group within Melanesia across the highlands of New Guinea.\n\nIt is commonly assumed that there is a sexual display element to wearing the koteka; however, according to the locals, kotekas are worn only to cover themselves.\n\nIn 1971–1972 the Indonesian government launched \"Operasi Koteka\" (\"Operation Penis Gourd\") which consisted primarily of trying to encourage the people to wear shorts and shirts because such clothes were considered more \"modern\". But the people did not have changes of clothing, did not have soap, and were unfamiliar with the care of such clothes so the unwashed clothing caused skin diseases. There were also reports of men wearing the shorts as hats and the women using the dresses as carrying bags.\n\nEventually the campaign was abandoned. Nevertheless, shirts and pants are required in government buildings, and children are required to wear them in school.\n\nPhallocrypts are decorative penis sheaths worn in parts of New Guinea during traditional ceremonies. They are usually made out of gourds or woven fibers and decorated with feathers, beads, cowry shells, and small metal ornaments. The most elaborate phallocrypts are sold to tourists as souvenirs and are not usually representative of ones actually used in ceremonies.\n\nA phallocrypt can also be a simple ornament hung from male genitalia as part of a cultural expression, for ceremonial use or pure decoration. Among a number of ancient and modern people throughout the Oceanic world, Africa and many parts of the Americas it was (and still is in some places) a common form of ornamentation. Some Aboriginal peoples of Australia wore an ornate carved-pearl-shell type called a Lonka Lonka. It is hung from the genitals by a twisted thong made of human hair. They are often ornately engraved with mainly geometric patterns and the grooves were colored with reddish ochre. Some South American cultures actually hung heavy, carved jade and other hardstone ornaments from piercings through the skin of their penis and scrotum. These were usually of a temporary ritualistic nature.\nSome native South American tribes have used them, mainly in Brazil and the Amazon rainforest area.\n\nThe use of penis gourds has also been documented in tropical Africa.\n\nPenis sheaths were sometimes worn by ancient Romans, often by singers since it was believed that it helped preserve their voice, but also by slaves or regular people to avoid sex.\n\n\n"}

She was especially noted for her performance in the classic role of \"Giselle\".\n\nAt her 1836 debut in London, Grisi performed with the accomplished danseur Jules Perrot. She next appeared in Paris at the Théâtre de la Renaissance (1840) and a year later, toured with Perrot to other parts of Europe. Through Perrot's contacts, the pair worked in Paris, London, Vienna, Munich, and Milan where she sang and danced. Of her two talents, it was her dancing that was acclaimed. By dancing Perrot's choreography, which at that time was receiving great attention, she gained notable attention of both the public and the critics.\n\nHer greatest role however was that of \"Giselle\". The world première of this two-act ballet was on 28 June 1841 at the Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique, Paris. The part of \"Albrecht\" was danced by Lucien Petipa (the brother of the great Marius Petipa), with the part of Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis danced by Adèle Dumilâtre. It caused a sensation and inspired its reviewers to proclaim \"Giselle\" to be the greatest ballet of its time and a triumphant successor to the Romantic masterwork \"La Sylphide\". As such, it immediately established Grisi as a star in her very first full-length ballet in Paris. Her salary grew from 5,000 francs to 12,000 in 1842 and 20,000 by 1844, with additional performance fees on top. It also marked the beginning of a change in her relationship with Jules Perrot.\n\nDance historian Lillian Moore says of her \"In Grisi were united all the best attributes of the other outstanding ballerinas of the romantic period: the buoyant elevation of Taglioni, the technical virtuosity and mimic powers of Elssler, and the joyous, exuberant facility of Cerrito. If she could not claim to surpass her peers in any one aspect of her art, Grisi outstripped them all in versatility.\"\n\nGrisi's last performance in the west was in Paul Taglioni's \"Les Métamorphoses\" (aka \"Satanella\", 1849).\n\nIn 1850, she joined Perrot in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he had been appointed ballet master, and she danced \"Giselle\" at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. The first Giselle in Russia had been danced by Fanny Elssler, and so the initial reaction to Grisi's interpretation of the role was not enthusiastic. However, over time the Russians appreciated her talents. She was \"Prima Ballerina\" of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg from 1850 to 1853, working not only with Perrot but also Joseph Mazilier who staged for her \"La Jolie Fille de Gand\" and \"Vert-Vert\" especially for her.\nIn 1854, with her daughter, she left Russia for Warsaw, where she intended to continue dancing, but she became pregnant by Prince Léon Radziwill who persuaded her to retire from ballet at the height of her fame. Grisi gave birth to her second daughter, Léontine Grisi, and at the age of 34 settled in Saint-Jean, Geneva to spend at Villa Grisi, also called Villa Saint-Jean which is no longer extant, the next 46 years of her life in peaceful retirement. She died in this district of the town on 20 May 1899, a month before her 80th birthday.\nOne of the creators of \"Giselle\" creators, Théophile Gautier, who was married to Carlotta's sister Ernestina, described her dancing as having a childlike artlessness, a happy and infectious gaiety. Carlotta Grisi was the cousin of the famous soprano singers, the sisters Giuditta and Giulia Grisi.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2231378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231378", "title": "The Lemon Drop Kid", "text": "The Lemon Drop Kid\n\nThe Lemon Drop Kid is a 1951 comedy film based on the short story of the same name by Damon Runyon, starring Bob Hope and Marilyn Maxwell. Although Sidney Lanfield is credited as the director, Frank Tashlin reportedly was hired, uncredited, to finish the film. The story had previously been adapted as a 1934 film starring Lee Tracy, with actress Ann Sheridan in a bit part. William Frawley is featured in both versions.\n\nThe song \"Silver Bells,\" sung by Hope and Maxwell, was introduced in this film.\n\nOn October 19, 2010, the film was released on DVD through Shout! Factory under license from the film's current distributor, FremantleMedia North America.\n\nThe Lemon Drop Kid (Bob Hope), a New York City swindler, is illegally touting horses at a Florida racetrack. The Kid touts across a beautiful woman intending to bet $2,000 on a horse named Iron Bar. Rigging a con, the Kid convinces her to switch her bet, but learns that she was betting for boyfriend and notorious gangster Moose Moran (Fred Clark). When the horse finishes dead last, a furious Moran demands the Kid pay him $10,000 (the amount he would have won) by Christmas Eve, or the Kid \"won't make it to New Year's.\"\n\nThe Kid decides to return to New York to try to come up with the money. He first tries his on-again, off-again girlfriend Brainey Baxter (Marilyn Maxwell). However, when talk of long-term commitment arises, the Kid quickly makes an escape. He next visits local crime boss Oxford Charlie (Lloyd Nolan), with whom he has had past dealings. However, Charlie is in serious tax trouble and does not particularly care for the Kid anyway. As he leaves Charlie's establishment, the Kid notices a street corner Santa Claus and his kettle.\n\nThinking quickly, the Kid fashions himself a Santa suit and begins collecting donations. He is recognized by a passing policeman, and the Kid is convicted of panhandling and sentenced to ten days in jail when he cannot pay the fine. The Kid learns where his scheme went wrong. After Brainey bails him out, he sets about making his scam legitimate by finding a charity to represent and a city license. The Kid remembers that Nellie Thursday (Jane Darwell), a kindly neighborhood resident, has been denied entry to a retirement home because of her jailed husband's criminal past.\n\nOrganizing other small-time New York swindlers and Brainey, who is both surprised and charmed at the Kid's apparent goodwill, the Kid converts an abandoned casino (ironically belonging to Moose Moran) into the \"Nellie Thursday Home For Old Dolls\". A small group of elderly women and makeshift amenities complete the project. The Kid receives the all-important city license. Now free to collect, the Kid and his compatriots dress up as Santa Claus and position themselves throughout Manhattan. The others are unaware that the Kid plans to keep the money for himself to pay off Moran. The scheme is a huge success, netting $2,000 in only a few days. An overjoyed Brainey decides to leave her job as a dancer and look after the \"home\" full-time until after Christmas. She informs her employer, Oxford Charlie.\n\nSeeing a potential gold mine, Charlie decides to muscle in on the operation. Reasoning that the Nellie Thursday home is \"wherever Nellie Thursday is\", Oxford Charlie and his crew kidnap the home's inhabitants (including Nellie and Brainey) and move them to Charlie's mansion in Nyack. The Kid returns to the home to find it deserted and the money he had hidden in a hollowed-out statue gone. Clued in by oversized Oxford footprints in the snow, the Kid and his friends pay Charlie a visit. When Charlie reveals the Kid's scheme through a phone conversation with Moose Moran, the Kid's accomplices become angry, but he manages to slip away. However, Brainey tracks him down and voices her disgust.\n\nAfter a few days of stewing in self-pity (and realizing it is Christmas Eve), the Kid is surprised to meet Nellie, who has escaped. He decides to recover the money, sneaking into Charlie's home in the guise of an elderly woman. He finds that Charlie and his crew are moving the women to a more secure location. The Kid confronts Charlie in his office. After a brief struggle, the Kid overpowers Charlie and makes off with the money, narrowly avoiding the thugs Charlie has sent after him. The ensuing chaos allows Brainey and the others to escape.\n\nLater that night, the Kid returns to the original Nellie Thursday home to meet with Moose Moran. The deal appears to be in jeopardy as Moran arrives with Charlie. Charlie demands that the Kid reimburse him, which would leave too little for Moran. However, the Kid hits a switch, revealing hidden casino tables. All are occupied, mainly by the escaped women. The Kid and his still-loyal friends hold off the gangsters as the police initiate a raid. Moran and Oxford Charlie are arrested. The Kid assures the judge who sentenced him earlier that he will focus his attention on the home, which he will make a reality. Nellie's husband Henry, free on parole, is joyously reunited with his wife.\n\n"}

He was the son of Thomas Creswick and Mary Epworth and educated at Hazelwood, near Birmingham.\n\nAt Birmingham he first began to paint. His earliest appearance as an exhibitor was in 1827, at the Society of British Artists in London; in the ensuing year he sent to the Royal Academy the two pictures named \"Llyn Gwynant, Morning\", and \"Carnarvon Castle\". About the same time he settled in London; and in 1836 he took a house in Bayswater. He soon attracted some attention as a landscape painter, and had a career of uniform and encouraging, though not signal success. In 1842 he was elected an associate, and in 1850 a full member of the Royal Academy, which, for several years before his death, numbered hardly any other full members representing this branch of art.\nIn his early practice he set an example, then too much needed, of diligent study of nature out of doors, painting on the spot all the substantial part of several of his pictures. English and Welsh streams may be said to have formed his favourite subjects, and generally British rural scenery, mostly under its cheerful, calm and pleasurable aspects, in open daylight. This he rendered with elegant and equable skill, color rather grey in tint, especially in his later years, and more than average technical accomplishment; his works have little to excite, but would, in most conditions of public taste, retain their power to attract.\n\nCreswick was industrious and extremely prolific; he produced, besides a steady outpouring of paintings, numerous illustrations for books. He was personally genial, a dark, bulky man, somewhat heavy and graceless in aspect in his later years. He died at his house in Bayswater, Linden Grove, after a few years of declining health. Among his principal works may be named \"England\" (1847); \"Home by the Sands, and a Squally Day\" (1848); \"Passing Showers\" (1849); \"The Wind on Shore, a First Glimpse of the Sea, and Old Trees\" (1850); \"A Mountain Lake, Moonrise\" (1852); \"Changeable Weather\" (1865); also \"the London Road, a Hundred Years ago\"; \"The Weald of Kent\"; \"the Valley Mill\" (a Cornish subject); \"a Shady Glen\"; \"the Windings of a River\"; \"the Shade of the Beech Trees\"; \"the Course of the Greta\"; \"the Wharfe\"; \"Glendalough\", and other Irish subjects, 1836 to 1840; the Forest Farm Frith for figures, and Ansdell for animals, occasionally worked in collaboration with Creswick.\n\nCreswick has paintings in several British Collections including Sheffield, Canterbury, Derby Art Gallery and the Nothampton Gallery.\n\n\n"}

She was a ballerina noted for the brilliance, strength, and vivacity of her dancing. She was also one of few women in the 19th century to be recognized for her talent as a choreographer.\n\nBorn in Naples, she studied under Carlo Blasis and the French choreographers Jules Perrot and Arthur Saint-Léon, the latter of whom was her husband from 1845–51. Fanny Cerrito was trained in the ballet school of San Carlo Opera House, later under the supervision of Salvatore Taglioni. Her first stage appearance was in 1832 when she gained recognition almost immediately. In 1836–37 her fame started to spread beyond Italy and she appeared in Vienna to reveal some of her own choreographed works. From 1838–40, she continued to dance with La Scala in Milan, where she gained even more attention. In 1843, Cerrito and Maria Taglioni danced in the same program in Milan; this event caused so much excitement that the city divided itself between the two great rival ballerinas. While in Milan, Fanny began her collaboration with Jules Perrot, during which they choreographed \"Ondine, ou La naïade\" (1843) as well as \"Alma\" (1842) and \"Lalla Rookh\" (1846). Later in 1845, her choreographic talent became recognized after she presented her own ballet, \"Rosida\". For nine seasons, from 1840 to 1848, Cerrito became a very well-respected dancer at Her Majesty’s Theatre, London, where the celebrity chef Alexis Soyer created a moulded dessert in her honour that was topped with a miniature figure of the dancer herself, weightlessly poised on a spun sugar zig-zag spiral. \n\nIn 1845, Cerrito danced in the \"Pas de Quatre\" with Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi and Lucile Grahn. As the least well-known dancer, Grahn agreed to dance first, while Taglioni had been offered the privilege of dancing in coveted last position, by unanimous consent. However neither Grisi nor Grahn would agree to dance before the other. It required great diplomacy on the part of Benjamin Lumley, the opera manager, to arrange the order of the middle two solos, and when he proclaimed that the elder of the two should go last, Cerrito was reluctant to claim her 'prize'!\n\n"}

The series primarily focuses upon the maintenance and repair of automotive vehicles, covering a wide range of makes and models (300 models of car and 130 models of motorcycle); the manuals are aimed mainly at DIY enthusiasts rather than professional garage mechanics, as they lack the depth of coverage on particular vehicles or problems. The series includes a range of 'practical lifestyle' manuals in the same style for a range of topics, including domestic appliances and personal computers, digital photography, model railways, sport, animal care, men,\nbabies,\nsex, and women. They also now publish the iconic Bluffer's Guides collection. \n\nAdditionally, Haynes have released manuals based on popular fictional series including \"Star Trek\" and \"Thomas and Friends\".\n\nThe Haynes manuals are named after John Harold Haynes (1938–2019). In 1956, when he was at school, he wrote and published a book on building a 'special' based on the Austin 7, and wrote two further books while performing national service in the Royal Air Force. J. H. Haynes & Co. Limited was founded on 18 May 1960 and the first manual actually entitled \"Haynes Owners Workshop Manual\", for the Austin-Healey Sprite, was published in 1965. Haynes was made an Officer of Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours List 1995 for services to publishing. He died on 8 February 2019, aged 80.\n\nMany Haynes Manuals bear a cover illustration of a cutaway view technical drawing of the vehicle, hand-drawn by Terry Davey, and they bear his signature.\n\nHaynes also publishes a range of Chilton manuals under licence from Cengage.\n\nIn 2013, Haynes acquired Clymer repair manuals from Penton Media.\n\nThe automotive vehicle manuals are based upon taking apart and putting together a vehicle. The cover of each manual states: \"based on a complete stripdown and rebuild\". Each section has step-by-step instructions with diagrams and photographs of an actual stripdown or rebuild.\n\nManuals for garage professionals include books such as the \"Automotive Diesel Engine Service Guide\", the \"Automotive Air Conditioning TechBook\", \"Citroën and Peugeot Engine Management Systems\", and two \"Engine Management and Fuel Injection Systems Pin Tables and Wiring Diagrams TechBook\" volumes.\n\nHaynes manuals are published in 15 languages: English (including British, American and Australian variants), French, Swedish, Chinese, Japanese, German, Czech, Finnish, Polish, Bulgarian, Hebrew, Greek, Danish, Spanish (including American Spanish versions), and Russian.\n\nThe company is based in Sparkford, a village near Yeovil in Somerset, England. The Haynes International Motor Museum, the largest motor museum in the UK, is also in Sparkford and it is home to a large collection of both classic and modern cars, and many rarities.\n\nHaynes manuals are written by a pair of authors, and take between 20 and 30 man-weeks. \nA car or motorcycle is bought at the beginning of the project and sold at the end. \nAlthough the workshop phase of the project usually lasts for roughly four weeks, the vehicle is usually retained for a couple of months to ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\nHaynes generally has the co-operation of the manufacturers to provide technical information such as mechanical tolerances and wiring diagrams. This may seem against their own interests since servicing can cost 40% of the cost of the vehicle over its lifetime, but manufacturers get loyalty by providing customers with information that lets them fix their vehicle, to their ability, or at least diagnose the fault before taking it to a garage. \nOver the lifetime of a vehicle, the aftermarket is worth perhaps as much as the new cost price of the vehicle, so the manufacturer still gets a significant revenue from the spare parts, and the longer a vehicle lasts, the more so.\n\n\n"}

Their best-known films include \"Salesman\" (1969), \"Gimme Shelter\" (1970) and \"Grey Gardens\" (1975).\n\nThe brothers were born in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, living there until the family moved to Brookline, Massachusetts when Albert was 13. Albert and David's parents, both Jewish, were immigrants to the United States; their father, born in Ukraine, was employed as a postal clerk, while their mother, originally from Poland, was a schoolteacher. The family originally settled in Dorchester to be near relatives (the brothers' great-uncle Josef Maysles and his daughter and son-in-law, Becky and Joe Kandib) who had moved there earlier.\n\nAlbert originally pursued a career as a psychology professor and researcher. After serving in World War II, Albert obtained a BA from Syracuse University and MA in psychology from Boston University. He taught psychology at Boston University for three years, also working as a research assistant at a mental hospital and as head of a research project at Massachusetts General Hospital. As an outgrowth of his research work, he traveled to Russia to photograph a mental hospital, and returned the following year with a camera provided by CBS to film his first documentary, \"Psychiatry in Russia\" (1955). Although CBS did not air the film, it was televised on NBC, on the public broadcasting station WGBH-TV in Boston, and on Canadian network television.\n\nDavid also studied psychology at Boston University, receiving a BA. He served in the U.S. Army in West Germany. In the mid-1950s, he worked as a Hollywood production assistant on the Marilyn Monroe films \"Bus Stop\" and \"The Prince and the Showgirl\". David later stated that he grew \"disenchanted with conventional filming. The glamour had faded and the filming of take after take had become tedious.\" By 1957 he had teamed up with Albert to shoot two documentaries behind the Iron Curtain, \"Russian Close-Up\" (credited to Albert Maysles alone) and \"Youth in Poland\", the latter of which was broadcast on NBC.\n\nBy 1960, the Maysles brothers had joined Drew Associates, the documentary film company founded by photojournalist Robert Drew which also included Richard Leacock and D. A. Pennebaker. Albert would film, while David would handle sound. During this time, the brothers worked on Drew Associates films such as \"Primary\" and \"Adventures on the New Frontier\". In 1962, Albert and David left Drew Associates to form their own production company, Maysles Films, Inc.\n\nThe Maysles brothers made over 30 films together. They are best known for three documentaries made in the late 1960s and early 1970s: \"Salesman\" (1969), \"Gimme Shelter\" (1970), and \"Grey Gardens\" (1975). \"Salesman\" documents the work of a group of door-to-door Bible salesmen in New England and Florida. \"Gimme Shelter\", a film about The Rolling Stones' 1969 U.S. tour culminating in the disastrous Altamont Free Concert, unexpectedly captured on film the altercation between Altamont attendee Meredith Hunter and Hells Angel Alan Passaro that resulted in Hunter's death. Film footage shows Hunter drawing and pointing a revolver just before being stabbed by Passaro, who was later acquitted of Hunter's murder on self-defense grounds after the jury viewed the footage. \"Grey Gardens\" depicts the lives of a reclusive upper-class mother and daughter, \"Big Edie\" and \"Little Edie\" Beale (who were, respectively, the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis), residing in a derelict mansion in East Hampton, New York. In order to finance these films and others, the Maysles also made commercials for clients such as IBM, Shell Oil, and Merrill Lynch.\n\nThe Maysles' films are considered examples of the style known as direct cinema. The brothers would let the story unfold as the camera rolled, rather than planning what exactly they wanted to shoot, in keeping with Albert Maysles' stated approach, \"Remember, as a documentarian you are an observer, an author but not a director, a discoverer, not a controller.\" However, the brothers also received criticism from those who thought that they had actually planned or otherwise influenced scenes. Most notably, Pauline Kael's negative review of the film \"Gimme Shelter\" in \"The New Yorker\" included a harsh accusation that much of \"Gimme Shelter\" and \"Salesman\" had been staged and that the main subject of \"Salesman\", Paul Brennan, was not a Bible salesman as the film portrayed, but was actually a roofing-and-siding salesman recruited as a professional actor. The Maysles brothers threatened legal action against \"The New Yorker\" after this accusation. They also sent an open letter to \"The New Yorker\" refuting Kael's claims; however, because the magazine at the time did not publish letters, the letter did not appear in print until 1996. In the case of \"Grey Gardens\", the brothers were also accused of unfairly exploiting their subjects.\n\nMany of the Maysles' documentaries focus on art, artists and musicians. The Maysles documented The Beatles' first visit to the United States in 1964, and a 1965 conceptual art project by Yoko Ono called \"Cut Piece\" in which she sat on the stage of Carnegie Hall while audience members cut off her clothing with scissors. Several Maysles films document art projects by Christo and Jeanne-Claude over a three-decade period, from 1974 when \"Christo's Valley Curtain\" was nominated for an Academy Award, to 2005 when \"The Gates\" (started in 1979 and completed by Albert after David's death) headlined New York's Tribeca Film Festival. Other Maysles subjects include Marlon Brando, Truman Capote, Vladimir Horowitz, and Seiji Ozawa.\n\nFor many years, the Maysles worked closely with film editor Charlotte Zwerin, who received a directing credit for her work on \"Gimme Shelter\". Zwerin eventually stopped working with the Maysles because, according to Zwerin, they would not let her produce.\n\nDavid Maysles, the younger brother, died of a stroke on January 3, 1987, seven days shy of his 56th birthday, in New York City. Following his death, Albert was involved in litigation with David's widow over the terms of a financial settlement. According to David's daughter Celia Maysles, this resulted in the family developing a \"code of silence\" regarding David. In 2007, Celia released a documentary about her father, \"Wild Blue Yonder\", which included interviews with Albert.\n\nAfter his brother's death, Albert Maysles continued to make films. His notable works include \"\" (2001, co-directed with Deborah Dickson and Susan Froemke), which focused on the struggles of a poor African-American family living in the contemporary Mississippi Delta, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature; and \"The Love We Make\" (2011, co-directed with Bradley Kaplan) which documented Paul McCartney's experiences in New York City following the September 11, 2001 attacks, and premiered on Showtime on September 10, 2011, the eve of the tenth anniversary of the attacks.\n\nAlbert continued the series of documentaries begun with David about the public art of Christo and Jeanne-Claude. He also contributed cinematography to Leon Gast's Academy Award-winning documentary \"When We Were Kings\", about the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" Muhammad Ali – George Foreman heavyweight championship boxing match. In 2005, Albert founded the Maysles Documentary Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the exhibition and production of documentary films that inspire dialogue and action, located in Harlem.\n\nAlbert died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Manhattan on March 5, 2015, aged 88. His films \"Iris\", about fashion icon Iris Apfel, and \"In Transit\", about the longest train route in the United States, were released posthumously later that year. At the time of his death, Albert had also been working on an autobiographical documentary entitled \"Handheld and From the Heart\".\n\nBy letting real-life action unfold on camera without interference from the crew, the Maysles pioneered the \"fly on the wall\" perspective in documentary cinema. This perspective is typical with the genre of documentary known as Direct Cinema which they helped pioneer. This genre is similar to cinéma vérité. They broke tradition with mid-century documentary tropes by eschewing narration, inter-titles and extraneous music tracks. The editing process could be interpreted as their narrative \"voice,\" depending on what footage and sound they chose to use and how the timeline of the story unfolded in the final cut.\n\nTheir success from a technical aspect was based in part on separating the camera from the sound recording device (David used a Nagra) by accurately controlling the speed of the camera and the tape recorder, allowing the two devices to be moved independently with respect to each other, an impossibility in commercially available equipment at the time. Long takes with ordinary equipment of the era would invariably lose synchronization.\n\nAlbert built his own 16mm camera with existing parts that could be comfortably balanced on his shoulder, eliminating the need for a tripod, allowing him to shoot fluidly in the moment. He added a brace so he could hold the camera steady during long takes. He installed a mirror near the lens and a ring on the focus-pull and could then set the aperture and focus while the camera rolled, ensuring continuity during a take.\n\nAlbert claimed to have a form of attention deficit disorder that made the leisurely pace of editing difficult for him but benefited him while shooting. Stating that his in-the-moment ability to focus let him, \"Zero in on a situation as it's happening [with his camera] and pay much closer attention and somehow anticipate what's going to happen the next moment, be ready for it and get it, the way people with normal attention spans are incapable of doing.\"\n\nThe Maysles brothers' films \"Salesman\" and \"Grey Gardens\" have been preserved in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.

Its GRAU designation is 9K114. Its NATO reporting name is AT-6 \"Spiral. The missile itself is known as the 9M114 Kokon (Cocoon).\n\nThe missile called 9M114 Kokon (Cocoon) was developed by the Kolomna Machine Design Bureau, which was also responsible for the 3M6 Shmel and 9M14 Malyutka. Work on the missile began in 1967, with the hope of using the missile on Mi-24s. However, delays forced the design of an upgraded Falanga system (9M17 Skorpion) using SACLOS guidance as a stopgap. Testing of the missile was completed in 1974, and it was accepted into service in 1976. The missile has no direct western counterpart, though, in role, it is closest to the AGM-114 Hellfire, and in guidance method, to the MGM-18 Lacrosse.\n\nIt was originally given the NATO designation AS-8, before being redesignated as AT-6.\n\nThe missile can be deployed on a variety of platforms, including the Mi-24V and from 1979-onwards the MT-LB based 9P149 tank destroyer. There is also a shipborne version of the missile, with the launcher holding six missiles.\n\nThe missile is transported and launched from a glass-reinforced plastic tube. The missile uses a Soyuz NPO solid-rocket sustainer, with a small booster stage to launch the missile from its tube.\n\nThe missile is SACLOS with a radio command link. The use of a radio link allows the missile to travel much faster and further than if it were wire guided. The radio link is a VHF system with five frequency bands and two codes to minimize the risk of jamming. The system comprises a KPS-53AV 8× daylight-only direct vision sight with an integrated laser rangefinder. After the missile is launched, the gunner has to keep the sight's crosshairs on the target until impact. Appropriate steering commands are transmitted to the missile via the radio link.\n\nThe missile flies above the gunner's line of sight to the target. With the range of the target determined by the laser rangefinder, the missile descends onto the target just before impact. This is done primarily to clear obstacles, instead of achieving a top-attack, and can be switched off. It is possible to engage low and slow moving helicopters with the system; however, since the missile only has a contact fuze, a direct hit would be needed.\n\nSoviet sources report kill ratios of 75–85% during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Also a Mil demonstration in Sweden in late 1995 using a Mi-28A firing Shturm and Ataka missiles also showed good results: from a hovering helicopter, a Shturm was fired at a target 900 m away; and from level flight at 200 km/h an Ataka was fired at a target 4,700 m away. Both missiles passed within 1 m of their aiming point.\n\nIt is possible there were problems with early models of the missile; Soviet stocks of the missile were rebuilt to AT-6B and C standard by 1994.\n\n30 June 2014 adopted by the Russian army modernized self-propelled antitank missile system 9M114 Shturm-S into 9K132 Shturm-SM having a sight with television and thermal channels as well as a new missile with a high-explosive fragmentation warhead and a proximity fuse.\n\nThe export price of the missile in 1992 was $50,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2231476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231476", "title": "Deshastha Brahmin", "text": "Deshastha Brahmin\n\nDeshastha Brahmins are a Hindu Brahmin subcaste mainly from the Indian state of Maharashtra and northern area of the state of Karnataka. The word \"Deshastha\" derives from the Sanskrit \"deśa\" (inland, country) and \"stha\" (resident), literally translating to \"residents of the country\". The valleys of the Krishna and the Godavari rivers, and a part of Deccan plateau adjacent to the Western Ghats, are collectively termed the \"Desha\" – the original home of the Deshastha Brahmins.\n\nMost of the well-known saints from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh were Deshastha Brahmins.\n\nOver the millennia, the deshastha community of Maharashtra region produced Sanskrit scholars such as Bhavabhuti, and saints such as Dnyaneshwar, Samarth Ramdas and Eknath. \n\nThe Deshastha community of the Karnataka region in the last millennium produced many Dvaita order philosophers and saints such as Jayatirtha, Sripadaraja and Purandara Dasa. \n\nTraditionally, Deshastha Brahmins as big landholders had enjoyed a higher ritual status in Maharashtra. Scholars Vora and Glushkova in their book \"Home, Family and Kinship in Maharashtra\" state that \"Deshastha Brahmins have occupied a core place in Maharashtrian politics, society and culture from almost the beginning of the Maharashtra's recorded history. Occupying high offices in the state and even other offices at various levels of administration, they were recipients of state honours and more importantly, land grants of various types.\"\n\nThe Brahmins are about 10% of the population in Maharashtra. Almost 60 percent of Maharashtrian Brahmins are Deshastha Brahmins In North Karnataka, especially in the districts of Bijapur, Dharwad and Belgaum Deshasthas were about 2.5% of the total population in 1960's. According to The Illustrated Weekly of India, (a weekly newsmagazine published by Times of India), By 1974, the Deshastha Brahmins are spread throughout the Deccan, especially in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Combined Andhra Pradesh. The exact percentage of population belonging to Deshastha community is very difficult to find out, since they are spread throughout the Deccan.\n\nDeshastha Brahmins fall under the Pancha Dravida Brahmin classification of the Brahmin community in India. Along with the Karhade and Konkanastha Brahmins, they are referred to as Maharashtrian Brahmins, which denotes those Brahmin subcastes of the Deccan Plateau which have a regional significance in Maharashtra. \n\nDeshastha Brahmins are further classified in two major sub-sects, the Deshastha Rigvedi and the Deshastha Yajurvedi, who earlier used to inter-dine but not inter-marry but now intermarriages between the two sub-groups is common. These sub-sects are based on the Veda they follow.\n\nThe Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins are treated as a separate and distinct caste from the Yajurvedi Madhyandina and Kannavas Brahmins by several authors, including Malhotra and Iravati Karve. Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins are the most ancient shakha among deshasthas. According to Iravati Karve, Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins are found in western and central Deccan along the banks of the Godavari and the Krishna rivers and are spread deep into Karnataka. Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins are endogomous group which include families from difference linguistic regions. Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins include some families that speak Marathi and some speak Kannada majority of marriages happen within the families of same language but the marriages between Marathi and Kannada speaking families do happen often. Marriage alliance between Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins, Telugu Brahmins and Karnataka Brahmins takes place quite frequently.\n\nThe Yajurvedis are further classified into two groups called the Madhyandins and the Kanavas. The Madhyandins follow the Madhyandin branch of the Shukla Yajurveda. The word \"Madhyandin\" is a fusion of two words \"Madhya\" and \"din\" which mean middle and day respectively. They are so called because they perform \"Sandhya Vandana\" at noon. Some Yajurvedi Deshasthas follow the 'Apastamba' subdivision of Krishna Yajurveda. Recently, the Yajurvedi Madhyandin and Yajurvedi Kannava Brahmins have been colloquially being referred to as Deshastha Yajurvedi Madhyandin and Deshastha Yajurvedi Kannava, although not all have traditionally lived or belonged to the Desh.\n\nThe Deshastha Rigvedi's and Deshastha Yajurvedi's started following the Vedantas propounded by Madhvacharya and Adi Shankara. They have produced a number of acharyas who has presided over various mathas. These seats of learning spread the teachings of the vedas, smritis, puranas and especially Advaita and Dvaita philosophies all over India, because of this they have Smarthas as well as Madhwas among them. These sub-sects are based on the Vedanta they follow.\n\n\nDeshasthas following Dvaita Vedanta of Madhvacharya are known as Deshastha Madhva Brahmins or Deshastha Madhvas Deshastha Madhva Brahmins are followers of ten Madhva Mathas. Out of the ten mathas, the Uttaradi Math, Vyasaraja Math and Raghavendra Math are considered to be three premier apostolic institutions of Dvaita Vedanta and are jointly referred as \"Mathatraya\". Out of the ten Deshastha Madhva mathas, Uttaradi Math is the largest. In South India Deshastha Madhvas have traditionally been bilingual in Marathi and Kannada, Telugu or Tamil.\n\n\nDeshasthas following Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara are known as Deshastha Smartha Brahmins or Deshastha Smarthas.\n\nThe valleys of the Krishna and Godavari rivers, and the plateaus of the Western Ghats (Sahyadri hills), are collectively called the Desha – the original home of the Deshastha Brahmins.\n\nThe Deshastha Brahmins are equally distributed all through the state of Maharashtra, ranging from villages to urban areas. Deshastha also settled outside Maharashtra, such as in the cities of Indore in Madhya Pradesh and those of Chennai and Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, which were a part of or were influenced by the Maratha Empire. The Deshastha Brahmins of Baroda in Gujarat are immigrants who came from the Deccan for state service. In Karnataka, the Deshastha Brahmins are mostly concentrated in the districts of Bijapur, Dharwad, Gulbarga, Belgaum, Bidar, Raichur, Bellary, and Uttara Kannada. In Andhra Pradesh, the Deshastha Brahmins have settled in various parts, particularly in the cities of Anantapur, Kurnool, Tirupati, Cuddapah, Hyderabad (which is now part of Telangana). In Coastal Andhra, Deshastha Brahmins settled in Nellore district, Krishna district and Guntur district. The Deshastha families who migrated to Telugu states completely adapted themselves to the Telugu ways, especially in food.\n\nThe military settlers (of Thanjavur) included Brahmins of different sub-castes and by reason of their isolation from their distant home, the sub-divisions which separated these castes in their mother-country were forgotten, and they were all welded together under the common name of Deshasthas. The Brahmin and the Maratha migrants migrated, in the 17th and 18th centuries, to Tanjore and other regions of present-day Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, from the Desh region of Maharashtra, but till today maintain their separate identities.Today's Marathi speaking population in Tanjore are descendants of these Marathi speaking people. The isolation from their homeland has almost made them culturally and linguistically alien to Brahmins in Maharashtra.\nThe early British rulers considered Deshastha from the south to be a distinct community and heavily recruited them in administrative service in the present day areas of Northern Karnataka after the fall of Peshwa rule in these areas in preference to Deshastha and other Brahmins from Desh.\n\n The word Deshastha comes from the Sanskrit words \"Desha\" and \"Stha\", which mean inland or country and resident respectively. Fused together, the two words literally mean \"residents of the country\". Deshastha are the Maharashtrian Brahmin community with the longest known history, making them the original and the oldest Hindu Brahmin sub-caste from Maharashtra. The Deshastha community may be as old as the Vedas, as vedic literature describes people strongly resembling them. This puts Deshastha presence on the Desh between 1100–1700 BC. As the original Brahmins of Maharashtra, the Deshasthas have been held in the greatest esteem in Maharashtra and they have considered themselves superior to other Brahmins.\n\nMarathi Brahmins started migrating to the Hindu holy city of Benares in the medieval period. They dominated the intellectual life of the city and established an important presence at the Mughal and other north Indian courts.\nDuring the Deccan sultanates era and early Maratha rule, the Deshasthas were closely integrated into the texture of rural society of Maharashtra region, as village record keepers (Kulkarnis) and astrologers (Joshis). As such they featured far more prominently in the eyes of the rural communities than any other Brahmin groups in the region. Before the rise of the Peshwas from the Bhat family, the Maratha bureaucracy was almost entirely recruited from the Deshastha community; but Balaji Vishwanath’s accession to power shattered their monopoly over the bureaucracy, even though they retained influence as Kulkarnis and Deshmukhs on rural Maharashtra.\nMany Deshastha brahmins moved to present day Andhra Pradesh for lack of opportunities in Chitpavan dominated Peshwa era.This group became part of the elite in this region, specifically around Guntur. By 19th century, Deshasthas had held a position of such strength throughout South India that their position can only be compared with that of the Kayasthas and Khatris of North India.\nAt the time of Indian independence in 1947, urban dwelling and professional Marathi Hindu people, mostly belonged to communities such as the Chitpavans and the CKPs. However, researcher Donald Kurtz concludes that although Deshasthas and other brahmin groups of the region were initially largely rural, they were mostly urbanised by the end of the 20th century.\n\nThe traditional occupation of the Deshasthas was that of priesthood at the Hindu temples or at socio-religious ceremonies. Records show that most of the religious and literary leaders since the 13th century have been Deshasthas. In addition to being village priests, most of the village accountants or Kulkarnis belonged to the Deshastha caste. Priests at the famous Vitthal temple in Pandharpur are Deshastha, as are the priests in many of Pune's temples. Other traditional occupations included village revenue officials, academicians, astrologer, administrators and practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine. Deshasthas who study the vedas are called Vaidika, astrologers are called \"Joshi\" and practitioners of medical science are called Vaidyas, and reciters of the puranas are called Puraniks.\n\nDeshasthas have contributed to the fields of Sanskrit, Marathi literature and Kannada literature, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\nThe Deshastha community in the Karnataka region produced the fourteenth century Dvaita philosopher saint Jayatirtha, the fifteenth and sixteenth century stalwarts of Haridasa movement and philosophers of Dvaita order, Vyasatirtha, who was also the \"Rajaguru\" of Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara Empire and his disciples Purandara Dasa and Vijayendra Tirtha, the seventeenth century philosopher-saint Raghavendra Tirtha. In fact, according to Sharma, all the pontiffs of Uttaradi Matha (a Dvaita monastery) beginning from Raghuvarya Tirtha, Raghuttama Tirtha to Satyapramoda Tirtha, without a single exception, belonged to the community. \n\nDeshasthas produced prominent literary figures in Maharashtra between the 13th and the 19th centuries. The great Sanskrit scholar Bhavabhuti was a Deshastha Brahmin who lived around 700 AD in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. His works of high Sanskrit poetry and plays are only equalled by those of Kalidasa. Two of his best known plays are \"Mahāvīracarita\" and \"Mālatī Mādhava\". Mahaviracarita is a work on the early life of the Hindu god Rama, whereas Malati Madhava is a love story between Malati and her lover Madhava, which has a happy ending after several twists and turns.\n\nMukund Raj was another poet from the community who lived in the 13th century and is said to be the first poet who composed in Marathi. He is known for the \"Viveka-Siddhi\" and \"Parammrita\" which are metaphysical, pantheistic works connected with orthodox Vedantism. Other well known Deshastha literary scholars of the 17th century were Mukteshwar and Shridhar Swami Nazarekar. Mukteshwar was the grandson of Eknath and is the most distinguished poet in the \"ovi\" meter. He is most known for translating the \"Mahabharata\" and the \"Ramayana\" in Marathi but only a part of the Mahabharata translation is available and the entire Ramayana translation is lost. Shridhar came from near Pandharpur and his works are said to have superseded the Sanskrit epics to a certain extent. Other major literary contributors of the 17th and the 18th century were Vaman Pandit, Mahipati, Amritaraya, Anant Phandi and Ramjoshi.\n\nThe Deshastha community has produced several saints and philosophers. Most important of these were Dnyaneshwar, Eknath and Ramdas. The most revered of all Bhakti saints, Dnyaneshwar was universally acclaimed for his commentary on the Bhagvad Gita. It is called Dnyaneshwari and is written in the Prakrit language. He lived in the 13th century. Eknath was yet another Bhakti saint who published an extensive poem called the \"Eknathi Bhagwat\" in the 16th century. Other works of Eknath include the \"Bhavartha Ramayana\", the \"Rukmini Swayamwara\" and the \"Swatma Sukha\". The 17th century saw the \"Dasbodh\" of the saint Samarth Ramdas, who was also the spiritual adviser to Shivaji.\n\nHemadpant who was the prime minister from 1259 to 1274 C.E. in the regimes of Kings Mahādeva (1259–1271) and Ramachandra (1271–1309) of Seuna Yādav Dynasty of Devagiri, which ruled in the western and southern part of India was a Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin.\n\nAccording to Robert Eric Frykenberg, the very origin of the Bahamani power appear to have been linked with support from local deccani leadership. Frykenberg also quotes that, The reason to Mahmud Gawan greatness as an administrator was due to his sagacious employment of groups of Maratha Brahmans known as Deshasthas.\n\nAccording to Robert Eric Frykenberg, the breakup of Bahamani authority following the senseless execution of the able Diwan in 1481 led to increasing dependence upon the services of the Deshasthas by the Sultanates of Bijapur, Golkonda, and Ahmednagar. \n\nDeccan Brahmins held prominent roles in the political, military and administrative hierarchy of the Vijayanagara Empire. Deshastha Madhva Brahmins also held high positions during the rule of Qutb shahis of Golkonda. The posts held by them include Deshmukh, Deshpande, Majumdar, Mannavar etc. in the districts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\n\nMost of Shivaji's principal Brahmin officers were Deshasthas, including all of his Peshwas. Other significant Deshasthas of the period were warriors such as Moropant Trimbak Pingle and Melgiri Pandit. At one point in the history of the Maratha Empire, seven out of eight Ashta Pradhan (Council of Eight Ministers) came from the community. In 1713, Balaji Vishwanath Bhat, a Kokanastha Brahmin was appointed as the fifth Peshwa and the seat of Peshwa remained in Konkanastha hands until the fall of the Maratha Empire. To obtain the loyalty of the locally powerful Deshastha Brahmins, the Konkanastha Peshwas established a system of patronage for Brahmin scholars. The lack of administrative positions during the Peshwa era forced Deshastha and other literate groups to find opportunities elsewhere in India such as the Guntur area in present-day Andhra Pradesh. According to Eric Frykenberg, By mid-nineteenth century all the vital positions in the subordinate civil and revenue establishments in the Guntur district were monopolized by certain Deshastha Brahmin families. According to Asian Economic Review, The tendency of the Deshastha Brahmins to consolidate the power by appointing their own relations was not only confined to Guntur, but this excellent habit extended throuhgout South India. By 19th century, Deshasthas had held a position of such strength throughout South India that their position can only be compared with that of the Kayasthas and Khatris of North India.\n\nThe Konkanastha Peshwa Baji Rao I, who coveted conquering Vasai or Bassein, sent an envoy to the Portuguese governor of Bassein. The governor, Luís Botelho, provided the rationale to do so by \"grossly insult[ing] the Peshwa's envoy\" by speaking of the handsome and fair-complexioned Bajirao, as a \"negro.\" The Peshwa then deployed his brother, Chimaji Appa in the conquest of Vasai. This was a hard-fought battle with the British supplying the Portuguese with advice and the Marathas with equipment. Khanduji Mankar of the Pathare Prabhu caste and Antaji Raghunath Kavale, a Yajurvedi Brahmin, both played important roles in the conflict. After the victory in 1739, the Jagir of Vasai was promised to Antaji Raghunath, but the promise was allegedly not kept by the Konkanastha Peshwas, who instead contested the claims of the Yajurvedis to be Brahmin. The full Brahmin status of the Vasai Yajurvedis was affirmed by an assembly of learned Brahmins in 1746. However, the case came up again in 1808 in the waning years of Peshwai .\n\n\nHistorian Govind Sakharam Sardesai lists 163 prominent families that held high ranks and played significant roles in politics, military and finance in 18th century Pune, the cultural capital of Maharashtra. Of these 163 families, a majority(80) were Deshastha, 46 were Chitpawan, 15 were CKP, and Karhade Brahmin and Saraswat accounted for 11 families each.\n\nAccording to PILC Journal of Dravidic Studies, Maratha people who migrated towards the South India were originally from Pune and Bijapur. They took the land route and passed through Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur. Another set of migrants migrated from Bijapur through North Karnataka, the districts of Cuddupah, Kurnool, Chittoor and North Arcot.\n\nThis Deshastha Brahmin migrant who served under Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan as the most trustworthy aide could successfully win over the confidence of the English in 1799. Diwan Purnaiah was a typical example of an elite adept in the art of accommodation and survival by changing loyalties in a most astonishing and successful manner. But the most important plus point in him that attracted the English was perhaps his technical abilities as a successful administrator, which the English could use to their advantage in later years'. Although, many Deshastha Brahmins were employed in the service of Hyder and Tippu, a greater penetration of them into the service was witnessed during the Dewanship of Purnaiah and during the succeeding years. One Rama Rao was appointed Foujdar of Nagar in 1799 by Purnaiya. Sowar Bakshi Rama Rao, Bargir Bakshi Balaji Rao, Babu Rao, Krishna Rao and Bhim Rao of Annigere were some of the notables among this class. When Purnaiah was Prime Minister of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan \nKrishna Rao served as Commander-in-Chief of Mysore Kingdom. During this time the revenue and finance departments were monopolized almost by them. With their mathematical mind, accuracy and memory they were ideally suited for these posts. Purnaiah governed the Mysore Kingdom as the first Dewan under Krishnaraja Wadiyar III and later Sovar Bakshi Rama Rao, Bargir Bakshi Balaji Rao, Babu Rao continued as the Dewans after him. Diwan Purnaiah was also the founder of Yelandur estate. Diwan Purnaiah's direct descendent P. N. Krishnamurti, who was the fifth jagirdar of Yelandur estate also served as the Diwan of Mysore from (1901 – 1906). Later many prominent Deshastha Brahmins such as Kollam Venkata Rao, V. P. Madhava Rao, T. Ananda Rao (son of Rajah T. Madhava Rao) and N. Madhava Rao governed the Mysore Kingdom as Dewans.\n\nAccording to Eric Frykenberg, \"Deshastha Madhwa Brahmins—a vestige of former regimes— who possessed the requisite clerical skills and knowledge of the revenue system and a capacity for concealing this knowledge through the use of this complicated book-keeping system and the Modi script who conspired to subvert the orders of the and to absorb a sizeable amount of land revenues\". According to Frykenberg, This was the reason why most of the Sheristadars, Naib Sheristadars and Tehsildars in Madras Presidency are exclusively selected from Deshastha Brahmin community, who are fluent in writing Modi script. According to Frykenberg, Deshasthas also are noted for their English skills during British colonial rule. At the beginning of the British Raj colonial rule, the most powerful Brahmin bureaucrats in the South India were Deshastha Brahmins, who were migrants from Maharashtra and North Karnataka. During the later years of the colonial rule Deshasthas increasingly lost out to the Tamil Brahmins due to their increase in the enthusiasm towards the English education.\n\nThe majority of Deshasthas speak Marathi, one of the major languages of the Indo-Aryan language family. The major dialects of Marathi are called Standard Marathi and Warhadi Marathi. Standard Marathi is the official language of the State of Maharashtra. The language of Pune's Deshastha Brahmins has been considered to be the standard Marathi language and the pronunciation of the Deshastha Rigvedi is given prominence. There are a few other sub-dialects like Ahirani, Dangi, Samavedi, Khandeshi and Puneri Marathi. There are no inherently nasalised vowels in standard Marathi whereas the Chitpavani dialect of Marathi, spoken in Pune does have nasalised vowels.\n\nAs with most Maharastrian Brahmin communities, Deshastha Brahmins are vegetarian. Typical Deshastha cuisine consists of the simple \"varan\" made from tuvar dal. \"Metkut\", a powdered mixture of several dals and a few spices is also a part of traditional Deshastha cuisine. Deshastha use black spice mix or \"kala\", literally black, masala, in cooking. Traditionally, each family had their own recipe for the spice mix. However, this tradition is dying out as modern households buy pre-packaged mixed spice directly from supermarkets. Puran poli for festivals and on the first day of the two-day marriage is another Marathi Brahmin special dish.\n\nMost middle aged and young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and trousers or shalwar kameez with the traditionally \"nauvari\" or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets due to a lack of demand. Older women wear the five-yard sari. Traditionally, Brahmin women in Maharashtra, unlike those of other castes, did not cover their head with the end of their saree. In urban areas, the five-yard sari is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies. Maharashtrian brides prefer the \"very Maharashtrian\" saree – the Paithani – for their wedding day.\n\nIn early to mid 20th century, Deshastha men used to wear a black cap to cover their head, with a turban or a pagadi being popular before that. For religious ceremonies males wore a coloured silk dhoti called a \"sovale\". In modern times, dhotis are only worn by older men in rural areas. In urban areas, just like women, a range of styles are preferred. For example, the Deshastha Shiv Sena politician Manohar Joshi and former Chief Minister of Maharashtra prefers white fine khadi kurtas, while younger men prefer modern western clothes such as jeans.\n\nIn the past, caste or social disputes used to be resolved by joint meetings of all Brahmin sub-caste men in the area.\n\nDeshastha Rigvedi Brahmins still recite the \"Rig Veda\" at religious ceremonies, prayers and other occasions. These ceremonies include birth, wedding, initiation ceremonies, as well as death rituals. Other ceremonies for different occasions in Hindu life include \"Vastushanti\" which is performed before a family formally establishes residence in a new house, Satyanarayana Puja, originating in Bengal in the 19th century, is a ceremony performed before commencing any new endeavour or for no particular reason. Invoking the name of the family's \"gotra\" and the \"Kula Daivat\" are important aspects of these ceremonies. Like most other Hindu communities, Deshasthas have a shrine called a \"devaghar\" in their house with idols, symbols, and pictures of various deities. Ritual reading of religious texts called \"pothi\" is also popular.\n\nIn traditional families, any food is first offered to the preferred deity as \"naivedya\", before being consumed by family members and guests. Meals or snacks are not taken before this religious offering. In contemporary Deshasthas families, the naivedya is offered only on days of special religious significance.\n\nDeshasthas, like all other Hindu Brahmins, trace their paternal ancestors to one of the seven or eight sages, the saptarshi. They classify themselves into eight \"gotras\", named after the ancestor rishi. Intra-marriage within gotras (Sagotra Vivaha) was uncommon until recently, being discouraged as it was likened to incest, although the taboo has considerably reduced in the case of modern Deshastha families who are bound by more practical considerations.\n\nIn a court case \"Madhavrao versus Raghavendrarao\", involving a Deshastha Brahmin couple, the German philosopher and Indologist Max Müller's definition of gotra as descending from eight sages and then branching out to several families was thrown out by reputed judges of a Bombay High Court. The court called the idea of Brahmin families descending from an unbroken line of common ancestors as indicated by the names of their respective gotras \"impossible to accept\". The court consulted relevant Hindu texts and stressed the need for Hindu society and law to keep up with the times emphasising that notions of good social behaviour and the general ideology of Hindu society had changed. The court also said that the mass of material in the Hindu texts are so vast and full of contradictions that it is almost an impossible task to reduce it to order and coherence.\n\nEvery Deshastha family has their own family patron deity or the \"Kuladaivat\". This deity is common to a lineage or a clan of several families who are connected to each other through a common ancestor. The Khandoba of Jejuri is an example of a Kuladaivat of some Maharashtrian Deshastha families; he is a common Kuladaivat to several castes ranging from Brahmins to Dalits. The practice of worshiping local or territorial deities as Kuladaivats began in the period of the Yadava dynasty. Other family deities of the people of Maharashtra are Bhavani of Tuljapur, Mahalaxmi of Kolhapur, Mahalaxmi of Amravati, Renuka of Mahur, Parashuram in Konkan, Saptashringi on Saptashringa hill at Vani in Nasik district. Despite being the most popular deity amongst Deshastha and other Marathi people, very few families regard Vitthal or other popular Avatars of Vishnu such as Rama or Krishna as their Kuldaivat, with Venkateswara of Tirupathi and Narasimha being the exceptions.\n\nUpon birth, a child is initiated into the family ritually according to the Rig Veda for the Rigvedi Brahmins. The naming ceremony of the child may happen many weeks or even months later, and it is called the \"barsa\". In many Hindu communities around India, the naming is almost often done by consulting the child's horoscope, in which are suggested various names depending on the child's Lunar sign (called Rashi). However, in Deshastha families, the name that the child inevitably uses in secular functioning is the one decided by his parents. If a name is chosen on the basis of the horoscope, then that is kept a secret to ward off casting of a spell on the child during his or her life. During the naming ceremony, the child's paternal aunt has the honour of naming the infant. When the child is 11 months old, he or she gets their first hair-cut. This is an important ritual as well and is called \"Jawal\".\n\nWhen a male child reaches his eighth birthday he undergoes the initiation thread ceremony variously known as Munja (in reference to the Munja grass that is of official ritual specification), \"Vratabandha\", or Upanayanam. From that day on, he becomes an official member of his caste, and is called a dwija which translates to \"twice-born\" in English, in the sense that while the first birth was due to his biological parents, the second one is due to the initiating priest and Savitri. Traditionally, boys are sent to gurukula to learn Vedas and scriptures. Boys are expected to practice extreme discipline during this period known as brahmacharya. Boys are expected to lead a celibate life, live off alms, consume selected vegetarian saatvic food and observe considerable austerity in behaviour and deeds. Though such practices are not followed in modern times by a majority of Deshasthas, all Deshasthas boys undergo the sacred thread ceremony. Many still continue to get initiated around eight years of age. Those who skip this get initiated just before marriage. Twice-born Deshasthas perform annual ceremonies to replace their sacred threads on Narali Purnima or the full moon day of the month of Shravan, according to the Hindu calendar. The threads are called \"Jaanave\" in Marathi and \"Janavaara\" in Kannada.\n\nThe Deshasthas are historically an endogamous and monogamous community for whom marriages take place by negotiation. The Mangalsutra is the symbol of marriage for the woman. Studies show that most Indians' traditional views on caste, religion and family background have remained unchanged when it came to marriage, that is, people marry within their own castes, and matrimonial advertisements in newspapers are still classified by caste and sub-caste. Deshasthas, particularly the Rigvedi sub-group, allow cross cousin marriage, just like many other Marathi castes.\n\nWhile arranging a marriage, \"gana\", \"gotra\", \"pravara\", \"devak\" are all kept in mind. Horoscopes are matched. The marriage ceremony is described as follows: \"The groom, along with the bride's party goes to the bride's house. A ritual named \"Akshat\" is performed in which people around the groom and bride throw \"haldi\" (turmeric) and \"sindur\" (vermilion) coloured rice grains on the couple. After the \"Kanyadan\" ceremony, there is an exchange of garlands between the bride and the groom. Then, the groom ties the Mangalsutra around the neck of the bride. This is followed by \"granthibandhan\" in which the end of the bride's \"sari\" is tied to the end of the groom's dhoti, and a feast is arranged at the groom's place.\"\n\nA Deshasthas marriage ceremony includes many elements of a traditional Marathi Hindu wedding ceremony. It consists of \"seemant poojan\" on the wedding eve. The \"dharmic\" wedding includes the \"antarpat\" ceremony followed by the vedic ceremony which involves the bridegroom and the bride walking around the sacred fire seven times to complete the marriage. Modern urban wedding ceremonies conclude with an evening reception. A Deshastha woman becomes part of her husband's family after marriage and adopts the gotra as well as the traditions of her husband's family.\n\nAfter weddings and also after thread ceremonies, Deshastha families arrange a traditional religious singing performance by a Gondhal group.\n\nDeshastha Brahmins dispose their dead by cremation. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights the fire to the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river on the third day after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the \"pinda\" being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a \"Śrāddha\" ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. \"Śrāddha\" becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.\n\nDeshasthas follow the Saka calendar. They follow several of the festivals of other Hindu Marathi people. These include Gudi Padwa, Rama Navami, Hanuman Jayanti, Narali Pournima, Mangala Gaur, Krishna Janmashtami, Ganesh Chaturthi, Kojagiri Purnima, Diwali, Khandoba Festival (Champa Shashthi), Makar Sankranti, Maha Shivaratri and Holi.\n\nOf these, Ganesh Chaturthi is the most popular in the state of Maharashtra, however, Diwali, the most popular festival of Hindus throughout India, is equally popular in Maharashtra. Deshasthas celebrate the Ganesha festival as a domestic family affair. Depending on a family's tradition, a clay image or \"shadu\" is worshiped for one and a half, three and a half, seven or full 10 days, before ceremoniously being placed in a river or the sea. This tradition of private celebration runs parallel to the public celebration introduced in 1894 by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. \"Modak\" is a popular food item during the festival. Ganeshotsav also incorporates other festivals, namely Hartalika and the Gauri festival, the former is observed with a fast by women whilst the latter by the installation of idols of Gauris.\n\nThe religious amongst the Deshasthas fast on the days prescribed for fasting according to Hindu calendar.\nTypical days for fasting are Ekadashi, Chaturthi, Maha Shivaratri and Janmashtami. Hartalika is a day of fasting for women. Some people fast during the week in honour of a particular god, for example, Monday for Shiva or Saturday for Hanuman and the planet Saturn, Shani.\nGudi Padwa is observed on the first of the day of the lunar month of Chaitra of the Hindu calendar. A victory pole or Gudi is erected outside homes on the day. The leaves of \"Neem\" or and shrikhand are a part of the cuisine of the day. Like many other Hindu communities, Deshasthas celebrate Rama Navami and Hanuman Jayanti, the birthdays of Rama and Hanuman, respectively, in the month of Chaitra. A snack eaten by new mothers called Sunthawada or Dinkawada is the prasad or the religious food on Rama Navami. They observe Narali-pournima festival on the same day as the much widely known north Indian festival of Raksha Bandhan. Deshastha men change their sacred thread on this day.\n\nAn important festival for the new brides is Mangala Gaur. It is celebrated on any Tuesday of Shravana and involves the worship of lingam, a gathering of womenfolk and narrating limericks or \"Ukhane\" using their husbands' first name. The women may also play traditional games such as Jhimma, and Fugadi, or more contemporary activities such as Bhendya till the wee hours of the next morning.\n\nKrishna Janmashtami, the birthday of Krishna on which day Gopalkala, a recipe made with curds, pickle, popped millet (\"jondhale\" in Marathi) and chili peppers is the special dish. Sharad Purnima also called as Kojagiri Purnima, the full moon night in the month of Ashvin, is celebrated in the honour of Lakshmi or Parvati. A milk preparation is the special food of the evening. The first born of the family is honoured on this day.\n\nIn Deshastha families Ganeshotsav is more commonly known as Gauri-Ganpati because it also incorporates the Gauri Festival.In some families Gauri is also known as Lakshmi puja. It is celebrated for three days; on the first day, Lakshmi's arrival is observed. The ladies in the family will bring statues of Lakshmi from the door to the place where they will be worshiped. The Kokanstha Brahmins, instead of statues, use special stones as symbols of Gauri. The statues are settled at a certain location (very near the Devaghar), adorned with clothes and ornaments. On the second day, the family members get together and prepare a meal consisting of puran poli. This day is the puja day of Mahalakshmi and the meal is offered to Mahalakshmi and her blessings sought. On the third day, Mahalakshmi goes to her husband's home. Before the departure, ladies in the family will invite the neighbourhood ladies for exchange of haldi-kumkum. It is customary for the whole family to get together during the three days of Mahalakshmi puja. Most families consider Mahalakshmi as their daughter who is living with her husband's family all the year; but visits her parents' (maher) during the three days.\n\nNavaratri, a nine-day festival starts on the first day of the month of Ashvin and culminates on the tenth day or Vijayadashami. This is the one of three auspicious days of the year. People exchange leaves of the \"Apti\" tree as symbol of gold. During Navaratri women and girls hold \"Bhondla\" referred as bhulabai in Vidarbh region, a singing party in honour of the Goddess.\n\nLike all Hindu Marathi people and to a varying degree with other Hindu Indians, Diwali is celebrated over five days by the Deshastha Brahmins. Deshastha Brahmins celebrate this by waking up early in the morning and having an \"Abhyangasnan\". People light their houses with lamps and candles, and burst fire crackers over the course of the festival. Special sweets and savouries like Anarse, Karanjya, Chakli, Chiwda and Ladu are prepared for the festival. Colourful Rangoli drawings are made in front of the house.\n\nDeshastha Brahmins observe the Khandoba Festival or \"Champa Shashthi\" in the month of Mārgashirsh. This is a six-day festival, from the first to sixth lunar day of the bright fortnight. Deshastha households perform \"Ghatasthapana\" of Khandoba during this festival. The sixth day of the festival is called Champa Sashthi. For Deshastha, the Chaturmas period ends on Champa Sashthi. As it is customary in many families not to consume onions, garlic and eggplant (Brinjal / Aubergine) during the Chaturmas, the consumption of these food items resumes with ritual preparation of Vangyache Bharit (Baingan Bharta) and \"rodga\", small round flat breads prepared from \"jwari\" (white millet).\nMakar Sankranti falls on 14 January when the Sun enters Capricorn. Deshastha Brahmins exchange \"Tilgul\" or sweets made of jaggery and sesame seeds along with the customary salutation \"Tilgul Ghya aani God Bola\", which means \"Accept the Tilgul and be friendly\". \"Gulpoli\", a special type of chapati stuffed with jaggery is the dish of the day.\n\nMaha Shivaratri is celebrated in the month of Magha to honour Shiva. A chutney made from curd fruit (\"Kawath\" in Marathi) is part of the cuisine of the day.\n\nHoli falls on the full moon day in Phalguna, the last month. Deshasthas celebrate this festival by lighting a bonfire and offering Puran Poli to the fire. Unlike North Indians, Deshastha Brahmins celebrate colour throwing five days after Holi on Rangapanchami.\n\nMaharashtraian Brahmins were absentee landlords and lived off the surplus without tilling the land themselves per ritual restrictions. They were often seen as the exploiter of the tiller. This situation started to change when the newly independent India enshrined in its constitution, agrarian or land reform. Between 1949–1959, the state governments started enacting legislation in accordance with the constitution implementing this agrarian reform or \"Kula Kayada\" in Marathi. The legislation led to the abolition of various absentee tenures like \"inams\" and \"jagirs\". This implementation of land reform had mixed results in different States. On official inquiry, it was revealed that not all absentee tenures were abolished in the State of Maharashtra as of 1985. Other social and political issues include anti-Brahminism and the treatment of Dalits.\n\nDuring British rule in 19th century, social reformers such as Jotiba Phule launched campaigned against Brahmin domination of society and in government employment.The campaign was continued in early 20th century by the maharaja of Kolhapur, Shahu.In 1920s the non-Brahmin political party under Keshavrao Jedhe led the campaign against Brahmins in Pune and rural areas of western Maharashtra. This period saw Brahmins losing their landholding and their migration to urban centers\nMaharashtrian Brahmins were the primary targets during the anti-Brahmin riots in Maharashtra in 1948, following Mahatma Gandhi's assassination. The rioters burnt homes and properties owned by Brahmins. The violent riots exposed the social tensions between the Marathas and the Brahmins.\n\nIn recent history, on 5 January 2004, the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) in Pune was vandalised by 150 members of the Sambhaji Brigade, an organisation promoting the cause of the Marathas. The organisation was protesting against a derogatory remark made by the American author James Laine, on Shivaji's Parentage in his book, \"Shivaji: A Hindu King in an Islamic Kingdom\". BORI was targeted because Srikant Bahulkar, a scholar at BORI, was acknowledged in Laine's book. The incident highlighted the traditionally uncomfortable Brahmin-Maratha relationship. Recently, the same organisation demanded the removal of Dadoji Konddeo from the \"Statue of Child Shivaji ploughing Pune's Land\" at Lal Mahal, Pune. They also threatened that if their demands were not met, they would demolish that part of statue themselves.\n\nUntil recent times, like other high castes of Maharashtra and India, Deshastha also followed the practice of segregation from other castes considered lower in the social hierarchy. Until a few decades ago, a large number of Hindu temples, presumably with a Deshastha priest, barred entry to the so-called \"untouchables\" (Dalit). An example of this was the case of the 14th century saint Chokhamela of the Varkari movement, who belonged to the Mahar caste. He was time and again denied entry to the Vitthal temple in Pandharpur, however, his mausoleum was built in front of the gate of the temple. In the early 20th century, the Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar, while attempting to visit the temple, was stopped at the burial site of Chokhamela and denied entry beyond that point for being a Mahar. Deshastha caste-fellow Dnyaneshwar and his entire family were stripped of their caste and excommunicated by the Deshasthas because of his father's return from \"sanyasa\" to family life. The family was harassed and humiliated to an extent that Dnyaneshwar's parents committed suicide. Other saints like Tukaram (Kunbi caste) were discriminated against by the Brahmins.\n\nThe Maharashtra Government has taken away the hereditary rights of priesthood to the Pandharpur temple from the Badve and Utpat Deshastha families, and handed them over to a governmental committee. The families have been fighting complex legal battles to win back the rights. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an organisation founded by K. B. Hedgewar advocates Dalits being head priests at Hindu temples.\n\nPrior to the rise of the Konkanastha Peshwas, the Konkanastha Brahmins were considered inferior in a society where the Deshasthas held socio-economic, ritual and Brahminical superiority. After the appointment of Balaji Vishwanath Bhat as Peshwa, Konkanastha migrants began arriving en masse from the Konkan to Pune, where the Peshwa offered some important offices to the Konkanastha caste. The Konkanastha kin were rewarded with tax relief and grants of land. Historians point out nepotism and corruption during this time.\n\nThe Konkanasthas were waging a social war on Deshasthas during the period of the Peshwas. By the late 18th century, Konkanasthas had established complete political and economic dominance in the region. As a consequence, many members of the literate classes, including Deshastha and Karhade Brahmins, left their ancestral region of Western Maharashtra and migrated to other areas of the Maratha empire such as around the east Godavari basin in the present-day states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. For example, many Deshasthas, Saraswats and CKPs moved to newly-formed Maratha states ruled by the Scindias, Gaikwads and others that were at the periphery of the Peshwa's kingdom. Richard Maxwell Eaton states that this rise of the Konkanastha is a classic example of social rank rising with political fortune. Since then, despite being the traditional religious and social elites of Maharashtra, the Deshastha Brahmins failed to feature as prominently as the Konkanastha. The Deshasthas looked down upon the Konkanasthas as newcomers in the 18th and 19th centuries. They refused to socialise and intermingle with them, not considering them to be Brahmins. A Konkanstha who was invited to a Deshastha household was considered to be a privileged individual, and even the Peshwas were refused permission to perform religious rites at the Deshastha \"ghats\" on the Godavari at Nasik. The Konkanasthas on their part, pursued for greater intellectual ability and better political acumen. During the British colonial period of 19th and early 20th century, Deshasthas dominated professions such as government administration, music, legal and engineering fields, whereas Konkanasthas dominated fields like politics, medicine, social reform, journalism, mathematics and education. The relations have since improved by the larger scale mixing of both communities on social, financial and educational fields, as well as with intermarriages.\n\nThe Deshastha Rigvedi sub-caste have community organisations in many major cities such as Mumbai, Dombivali, Belgaum, Nasik, Satara etc. Most of these organisations are affiliated to Central organisation of the community called Akhil Deshastha Rugvedi Brahman Madhyavarty Mandal (A. D. R. B. M.) which is located in Mumbai. The activities of ADRBM includes offering scholarships to needy students, financial aid to members, exchange of information, and Matrimonial services. The Deshastha community organisations are also affiliated to their respective local All Brahmin Umbrella Organizations.\nSimilar to the Rigvedi community, there are organisations and trusts dedicated to the welfare of the Yajurvedi sub-caste.\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

It premiered on 10 February 1673 at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris and was originally choreographed by Pierre Beauchamp. \n\nMolière had fallen out with the powerful court composer Jean-Baptiste Lully, with whom he had pioneered the \"comédie-ballet\" form a decade earlier, and had opted for the collaboration with Charpentier. \"Le malade imaginaire\" was Molière's last work. He collapsed during his fourth performance as Argan on 17 February and died soon after.\n\n\nThe play opens with Argan, a severe hypochondriac, going through the bill from his apothecary (the pharmacist) item by item. He pays out only about half of what is on the bill. That done, he calls for his maid, Toinette. When she fails to appear immediately he shouts and calls her names until she arrives. Toinette is not interested in putting up with Argan's temper, so she mocks his rage. Eventually he gives up trying to scold her and asks her to call in his daughter, Angelique. Angelique is ready to talk to him, but Argan must leave the room for a short while (presumably the result of an \"injection\" [i.e., enema] he's just had).\n\nWhile he is out, Angelique takes the opportunity to talk to Toinette. We quickly find out that she has been talking almost non-stop about the qualities of a young man named Cléante since she met him at a play six days ago. She expects Cléante to ask her father if he can marry her, within a few days.\n\nArgan returns and expects to surprise his daughter when he tells her that someone has asked to marry her. He is shocked to find that she not only knows about it, but could not be happier. Unfortunately, Angelique thinks he's been talking about Cléante, while her father has promised his daughter to Thomas Diaforious, the son of a respected Paris doctor who is soon to be made a doctor himself.\n\nToinette asks him why, with all his money, Argan would want a doctor for a son-in-law. He replies that since he is always ill, he thought it would be a good idea to have a doctor in the family. Then he could have Thomas Diaforious' services as doctor all the time, not to mention the services of his father and his uncle for free. Toinette will not take his hypochondria seriously and tells him that she knows Angelique will never agree to that marriage. More than that, Toinette downright forbids the union to happen. This is amazing gall for a servant, and Argan becomes so incensed that he chases Toinette around the room threatening to kill her. Finally he stops, exhausted, and claims he is dying.\n\nHearing the disturbance, Argan's second wife Béline runs in. She soothes Argan, talking to him as one would to a child throwing a temper tantrum. Once his new wife has calmed him, Argan asks if she has contacted a notary; he intends to change his will to include (and heavily favour) Béline. She dramatically begs him not to think of such things, but just happens to have the notary to hand. Béline repeatedly claims that she doesn't care about the money, but double-checks the amounts all the same. The notary warns Argan that he can't leave his wife anything, but instructs him on several devious and underhanded methods whereby Béline could get all the money.\n\nMeanwhile, outside the study, Toinette and Angelique have a chance to talk in private. Toinette warns Angelique that her stepmother is plotting to get her inheritance, but Angelique does not care, so long as she is allowed to marry as she wishes. She begs Toinette to help her foil her stepmother and father's plans, a proposition to which Toinette is only too delighted to agree. She also endeavors to find a way to tell Cléante of the intended marriage.\n\nCléante shows up in disguise at the door, surprising Toinette. He has come pretending to be a substitute for Angelique's music teacher so he can talk to her in private. However, when Argan learns of the \"music master's\" arrival, he decides that he wants to watch the music lesson, spoiling everyone's plans. When Angelique comes in, she is shocked to find Cléante there, but manages to cover her reaction. Then Argan invites Cléante to stay as a guest as Angelique is introduced to her fiancé, Thomas Diaforious.\n\nWhen Mr. Diaforious and his son Thomas enter, Mr. Diaforious tells Thomas to begin. Thomas asks if he should start with Argan and, once his father tells him to, he greets Argan with a florid prepared speech. Once finished, he asks his father if that was satisfactory and if he should continue. He has a fancy prepared speech ready for every member of the family.\n\nEveryone has a seat and Argan praises Thomas. Mr. Diaforious says that he is very pleased with his son. He says that as a child he was never very bright or exciting and he never has had any wit or liveliness, but he has sound judgement. What Mr. Diaforious is most happy about in his son, though, is that he blindly adheres to the ancient medical beliefs and refuses to believe the new modern ideas like \"circulation of the blood.\"\n\nArgan asks if Thomas is to become a doctor for the rich at court. Mr. Diaforious says he much prefers to treat the common people. He adds that with ordinary people he is less accountable to anybody and, as long as procedure is followed, there is no need to worry so much about the results; the rich are much more difficult since they actually seem to expect to be cured.\n\nArgan then tells Cléante to help Angelique sing a song for the party. Cléante gives her a scroll of music with no words and tells everyone that it is a short piece from an improvised opera. Cléante then sings his love and his questions to Angelique in the guise of this opera. She answers him in the same form, telling him that she really loves him and despises the man her father wants her to marry. Their song continues until Argan stops it, thinking it dreadfully inappropriate. He sends Cléante away.\n\nArgan tells Angelique to pledge herself to Thomas, but she refuses. She suggests that they ought to get to know each other first. Argan, however, disagrees. He says that there will be plenty of time for getting to know each other once they are married. As for Thomas, it is enough for him that his father has instructed him to be in love with her. Angelique tries to argue the point with him, but the arguing proves useless.\n\nArgan gets angry with Angelique's willfulness and everyone's failure to pay attention to him during the fight. He tells Angelique that she has four days to decide. Either she marries Thomas, or she goes into a convent.\n\nAngelique runs out and Béline decides to go to town for a while. Argan is left with the two doctors and begs them to examine him. It is very obvious they do not know what they are doing. However, they make up lies which are good enough to convince Argan the hypochondriac.\n\nOn her way out, Béline stops to tell Argan that she saw Angelique talking with a young man who ran away as soon as they were spotted. She tells him that his youngest daughter, Louison, saw everything. Argan calls Louison to him for an interrogation. After much coaxing and Louison faking her own death, she tells him that the man claiming to be Angelique's music teacher came to her window and told her over and over how he loved her.\n\nArgan's brother, Beralde, who is a lawyer, comes to visit him. He is not convinced by Argan's claims about how sick he is. Beralde tells his brother that he has a match for Angelique. At the mention of his daughter's name, Argan flies into a rage and Beralde calms him by telling him about a dance troupe that has come to amuse him. There is a dance interlude as Gypsies dance and sing about the joys of young love and the pain when it proves false.\n\nNow that they have both enjoyed the interlude, Beralde wants to have a chat with his brother, but Argan insists he must take a short walk first (he's had another \"injection\"). Once Argan is gone, Toinette begs Beralde not to give up on helping his niece. He says that he will do everything he can. Toinette hints that she has a plan herself, but cannot tell what it is because her master has returned.\n\nNow that Argan has returned, Beralde first asks his brother why he would want to send his daughter to a convent. Beralde points out that sending them to a convent was Beline's idea and suggests that she might want the children out of the way for her own reasons, but Argan gets angry and leaps to her defense. Then Beralde asks Argan why he would want to marry his daughter to a doctor so unsuited for her. Argan says that if the doctor is good enough for him, he is good enough for Angelique. Beralde wants to hear no more of this. He points out to Argan that he (Argan) is one of the healthiest people he (Beralde) knows and that Argan's infatuation with doctors and apothecaries is bad for him and everyone else. The doctors, he says, know nothing about the workings of the human body and therefore can do nothing to cure it. The doctors are only educated enough to give fancy Latin names to the things they do not comprehend. They will kill their patients with the best of intentions, but they will still be dead. Beralde believes that all one need do is rest and let nature take its course.\n\nMr. Fleurant, the apothecary and Purgon's assistant, comes in with a new remedy for Argan. Beralde asks Argan not to take the remedy and to put it off until tomorrow, but this makes Fleurant very angry and he storms off to tell Dr. Purgon about this interference. Beralde tries once again to get his brother to give up his addiction to doctors, but Argan claims to be too sick. Just then Mr. Purgon enters in a furious temper, having been told that his cure was sent back, and rages at Argan. He refuses to treat Argan any more and says that within a few days Argan will go from one horrible disease to another and finally die. With that, he storms out.\n\nLeft with Beralde again, Argan cries and says that he can already feel his system shutting down, just as Mr. Purgon had told him. Beralde thinks he is crazy and tells him so, but Argan won't listen. He is sure that he is already dying. Toinette comes in and says that a new doctor has arrived who wants to treat Argan. She doesn't know who the man is, but says that he looks exactly like her. Argan is desperate and consents to see him.\n\nToinette comes in dressed as a doctor and claims to be one of the world's greatest doctors who has come to see Argan, one of the world's most illustrious patients. She tells Argan that all of his previous doctors were idiots who have totally misdiagnosed him. Argan tells him everything that has been prescribed, and Toinette (as the doctor) contradicts every one, saying his doctors were ignorant quacks. She goes on to make him realize that not everything doctors tell him is true; she blames his one arm for taking up all the nutrients, so he should have it amputated so as to make his other arm stronger. She also says that one of his eyes is taking up all the nutrients that go to it, so if he has it removed, his remaining eye will see much better. After spouting more of this medical nonsense, the \"doctor\" leaves and Toinette comes back on as herself, supposedly outraged that the departing \"doctor\" has been trying to take liberties with her (wanting to \"take [her] pulse\").\n\nBeralde then tries to convince his brother that since he has already fallen out with Purgon, he should consider a different marriage for his daughter. But Argan wants her put into a convent as a punishment for her willfulness. Beralde suggests that the real reason is that Beline wants it. Argan begins to get angry again, but Toinette steps in and says she has a solution to prove to Beralde how much Beline loves her husband. She suggests that Argan lie down on the couch and pretend to be dead. Then everyone will see how she really feels about him by her grief. Everyone thinks this is an excellent plan.\n\nBeralde hides as Beline comes in. She finds Toinette crying and Toinette tells her Argan is dead. Beline does not shed a tear, but is instead overjoyed that Argan is finally dead. She calls him many horrible names, then asks Toinette to help her cover up his death until she can get his money. With that, Argan gets up and surprises Beline. He shouts that he's glad to have found her out as she runs off. Just then they hear Angelique coming, and Toinette suggests he do the same thing to find out how she feels.\n\nWhen Angelique hears that her father is dead, she is inconsolable. She cries and says that she has lost one of the dearest things in the world to her. She is even more upset because she has lost him when he was still angry with her. Cléante comes in to comfort her, but it is no good. She tells Cléante that they can never get married now; since her father's last wishes were that she be a nun, that is what she will do.\n\nWith that, Argan gets up and hugs his daughter. She and Cléante are both delighted that he is alive. Argan agrees to their marriage, saying that she and Cléante can marry... as long as Cléante becomes a doctor. He agrees, but Beralde stops him. He suggests that Argan should just become a doctor himself, since no disease would dare to attack a doctor. Argan approves of the idea and Beralde says he knows a number of members of the medical faculty who can make Argan a doctor that very night.\n\nHe invites the gypsy dancers back and they perform a ceremony in song and dance that, they claim, makes Argan a doctor \"(in the translation by John Wood, Argan suffers a heart attack during the dance and dies, whereupon the dancers stop dancing and assume deaths-head masks)\".\n\n\nAn hour-long version adapted by Richard MacDonald was broadcast on the NBC radio series \"Great Plays\" on 15 December 1940.\n\nIn 1998, the L.A. Theatre Works recorded and released a production () featuring an adaptation by Beth Miles (who also directed the production) based on the John Wood translation (without the tragic twist ending; see above) and performed by The Actors' Gang. To date, this is the only English full-length recording of this play.\n\n\n\n"}

Its short, dense fur is grey over most of the body, with a black line running down the back and onto the tail, and pale, almost white, underparts. The ears are triangular, broad, and relatively large, and are reddish on the outer surface and white on the inner surface. The inner surfaces of the legs are similar in color to the underparts, while the outer surface is reddish on the fore limbs, and grey on the hind limbs; the lower hind limb also bears a distinctive black spot. Adults range from in body length, and weigh ; males are about 10% heavier than females.\n\nIn the northern part of its range, the pampas fox is more richly colored than in the southern part.\n\nThe pampas fox can be found in northern and central Argentina, Uruguay, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. It prefers open pampas habitats, often close to agricultural land, but can also be found in montane or chaco forest, dry scrubland, and wetland habitats. It is most common below elevation, but can inhabit puna grasslands up to .\n\nFive subspecies are currently recognised, although the geographic range of each is unclear, and the type localities of three of them lie outside the present-day range of the species:\n\n\nFossils of this species are known from the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene of Argentina.\n\nIn the Spanish-speaking areas of its habitat, the pampas fox is known by the common names of \"zorro de las pampas\" or \"zorro gris pampeano\". In Portuguese-speaking Brazil, it is called by the common names of \"graxaim\" or \"sorro\".\n\nThe pampas foxes mostly live a solitary life, but come together as monogamous pairs in the breeding season to raise their young. They are mainly nocturnal, becoming active at dusk, although may also be active during the day. They den in any available cavity, including caves, hollow trees, and the burrows of viscachas or armadillos. Even when raising young together, adult foxes generally hunt alone, marking their territory by defecating at specific latrine sites. Although considerable variation is seen, the home range of a typical pampas fox has been estimated to be around .\n\nPampas foxes are more omnivorous than most other canids, and have a varied and opportunistic diet. Their primary prey consists of birds, rodents, hares, fruit, carrion, and insects, although they also eat lizards, armadillos, snails and other invertebrates, lambs, and the eggs of ground-nesting birds. Their primary predators are pumas, domesticated dogs, and anacondas, most notably the yellow anaconda.\n\nPampas foxes breed in the early spring, with the female coming into heat just once each year. After a gestation period of 55 to 60 days, the mother gives birth to a litter of up to eight kits. The young are born between September and December, and are weaned around two months of age. Females reach sexual maturity in their first year, and animals have lived for up to 14 years in captivity.\n\nPups hunt with parents when they are 3 months old. The males bring food to their females, which stay at the den with kits.\n\nThe main threats to the pampas fox comes from humans hunting them for their fur, to prevent them from attacking livestock, and may be affected by the loss of their natural habitat, although, because they remain common in most areas where they have been studied, the pampas fox is not presently considered a threatened species.\n"}

Depending on the time period and culture, the term can have several meanings. During the Renaissance time period it was used in a Platonic format to designate the \"aetheric vehicle or starlike garment surrounding the soul which descended from heaven and entered the individual body\". It was thought to be one of the three parts of the human soul that contained the \"thoughts, cogitations, desires, imaginations that were impressed upon the mind at the time of death\" as well as lust and anger. The philosopher Marsilio Ficino considered it to be a link between the physical body and the incorporeal soul while others such as Jean Fernel associated it more with animal spirits. Philosopher Henry More introduced the term into the medical setting and considered the astral spirit to be a part of the body that was separate from the \"rational soul\". More's viewpoint was criticized as \"[reducing] spiritual phenomena ... to pseudo-physical explanations\".\n\nAstral spirits have also been associated with the familiar spirit and witchcraft, specifically black magic, and was considered at one point to be demonic in origin. This definition of astral spirits considered the entities to be completely separate from the concept of the astral spirit as something that was considered to be part of or attached to the human body or soul. The term was also used in relation to the concept of ghosts and vampirism, as spiritualists in the nineteenth century believed that the astral spirit would rise from the grave of the deceased in order to steal the blood and vitality of the living while the physical body would remain in the grave. This form of the astral spirit, while sometimes considered to be harmful, fell into the Platonic definition as it was considered to be a remnant of the deceased in some form. Astral spirits were also considered to be potentially capable of fathering a child, as there were some tales of astral spirits reportedly impregnating the wife of a deceased hajduk.\n\nWhen people refer to black shadow like apparitions commonly referred to as \"shadow people\" or \"shadow beings\" they are actually referring to astral beings. Shadow people are astral beings. However there are countless other types of astral beings. \n"}

The Swedish force consisted of troops from Savolax and Östergötland. After the main Swedish army had been defeated at the Battle of Oravais the army under Johan August Sandels in Savonia had to retreat in order not to be outflanked by the Russians. Sandels found a good defensive position north of Iisalmi and decided to resist the Russian advance there.\n\nBetween September 29 and October 27 a cease-fire was in effect. Sandels was heavily outnumbered but had a good defensive position between two lakes connected by the Koljonvirta river and he had prepared his position well during the cease-fire. On October 27 the cease-fire was to end at 1 PM, but Russians started their attack a little earlier, perhaps because of the time difference between Sweden and Russia. Sandels pulled back the forces on the south side of the river and the Russians attacked over the partially demolished bridge. The Swedes counter-attacked and literally pushed the Russian troops into the river. The Russians pulled up fresh troops on the south side of the river, but they didn't try to attack again. The battle was the last Swedish victory on Finnish soil.\n"}

The bulk of Syriac literary production dates to between the 4th and 8th centuries.\nSyriac literacy survives into the 9th century, but Syriac Christian authors in this period increasingly write in Arabic. \nThe emergence of spoken Neo-Aramaic is conventionally dated to the 13th century, but there are a number of authors that continue to produce literary works in Syriac in the later medieval period,\nand literary Syriac ( \"\") continues to be in use among members of the Syriac Orthodox Church.\n\n\"Classical Syriac\" is the term for the literary language as it developed by the 3rd century. \nThe language of the first three centuries of the Christian era is also known as \"Old Syriac\" (but sometimes subsumed under \"Classical Syriac\").\n\nThe earliest Christian literature in Syriac was biblical translation, the Peshitta and the Diatessaron. \nBardaisan was an important non-Christian (Gnostic) author of the 2nd century, but most of his works are lost and only known from later references. An important testimony of early Syriac is the letter of Mara bar Serapion, possibly written in the late 1st century (but extant in a 6th- or 7th-century copy). \n\nThe 4th century is considered to be the golden age of Syriac literature. The two giants of this period are Aphrahat, writing homilies for the Nestorian church in the Persian Empire, and Ephrem the Syrian, writing hymns, poetry and prose for the church just within the Roman Empire. The next two centuries, which are in many ways a continuation of the golden age, sees important Syriac poets and theologians: Jacob of Serugh, Narsai, Philoxenus of Mabbog, Babai the Great, Isaac of Nineveh and Jacob of Edessa.\n\nThere were substantial efforts to translate Greek texts into Syriac. A number of works originally written in Greek survive only in Syriac translation. Among these are several works by Severus of Antioch (d. 538), translated by Paul of Edessa (fl. 624). A \"Life\" of Severus was written by Athanasius I Gammolo (d. 635).\nNational Library of Russia, Codex Syriac 1 is a manuscript of a Syriac version of the Eusebian Ecclesiastical History dated to AD 462.\n\nAfter the Islamic conquests of the mid-7th century, the process of hellenization of Syriac, which was prominent in the sixth and seventh centuries, slowed and ceased. Syriac entered a silver age from around the ninth century. The works of this period were more encyclopedic and scholastic, and include the biblical commentators Ishodad of Merv and Dionysius bar Salibi. Crowning the silver age of Syriac literature is the thirteenth-century polymath Bar-Hebraeus.\n\nThe conversion of the Mongols to Islam began a period of retreat and hardship for Syriac Christianity and its adherents. However, there has been a continuous stream of Syriac literature in Upper Mesopotamia and the Levant from the fourteenth century through to the present day. This has included the flourishing of literature from the various colloquial Eastern Aramaic Neo-Aramaic languages still spoken by Assyrian Christians. This \"Neo-Syriac\" literature bears a dual tradition: it continues the traditions of the Syriac literature of the past, and it incorporates a converging stream of the less homogeneous spoken language. The first such flourishing of Neo-Syriac was the seventeenth century literature of the School of Alqosh, in northern Iraq. This literature led to the establishment of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and so called Chaldean Neo-Aramaic as written literary languages. In the nineteenth century, printing presses were established in Urmia, in northern Iran. This led to the establishment of the 'General Urmian' dialect of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic as the standard in much Neo-Syriac Assyrian literature. The comparative ease of modern publishing methods has encouraged other colloquial Neo-Aramaic languages, like Turoyo and Senaya, to begin to produce literature.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Later it manufactured storage network products. Alacritech's main products were the ANX 1500 series of network throughput acceleration appliances.\n\nAlacritech was founded in 1997 by Larry Boucher, the author of the SCSI standard and founder of both Auspex Systems and Adaptec. The company's network interface cards (NICs) were promoted for enhanced performance by moving some TCP/IP processing from the CPU to the NIC. In 2004, Alacritech sued Microsoft and Broadcom for patent infringement. The suits were settled in 2005 with both companies agreeing to license the Alacritech patents.\n\nIn 2008 Alacritech decided that the TOE / NIC business was not sufficient to sustain a viably growing company, and changed its focus to leveraging this technology for accelerating of network attached storage (NAS), resulting in the development of the ANX series of appliances.\n\nThe ANX 1500 throughput acceleration appliance supported TCP/IP, NFS, DHCP and 10GbE standards and features 48GB of DRAM and up to 4TB of solid state drives. The ANX 1500 caches active data stemming from client requests, such as frequent access of the same payload data or NFS metadata, and optimizes performance through the use of TCP and NFS Offload technology embedded in Alacritech's custom silicon. The ANX 1500 has a two-tiered caching system that provides record performance by accelerating READ and NFS metadata-intensive OPS, greatly reducing the burden on existing NAS devices, and enabling better WRITE performance and scalability. With a performance layer based on frequency of use, NFS OPS are maximized, resulting in reduced traffic on backend NAS servers, and a dramatic reduction in total IOPS required and storage drives needed from back-end storage.\n\nThe ANX 1500 accelerates NFS throughput and enhances the performance of existing NAS boxes. A single ANX 1500, with 4TB of SSDs, can deliver 120,000 NFS SPECsfs2008 operations per second (OPS) and an ORT of .92ms and only requires 1/5 of the NAS infrastructure otherwise required to deliver the comparable NFS OPS performance. The appliance allows enterprises to achieve significantly higher disk utilization, using 80 percent of available disk space, versus the current standard of 20 percent in performance environments.\n\nThe company did not achieve sufficient sales of the ANX product line to sustain ongoing operations and development, and shut down manufacturing and development operations in November 2013. The company website currently notes that the ANX product line is no longer being manufactured, but provides links for support of existing installations. As of 2018 the company was in the business of licensing it's technology.\n\n"}

The project was led by bassist Jerry Only, who adopted a new stage name, \"Mo the Great\" (or alternately, \"Mocavious Kryst\"), and his younger brother, guitarist Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein. The band fused fantastical and sci-fi imagery with religious themes and messages. The band has also been referred to as a \"guitar shop project\", as Only and Doyle constantly tweaked and refined their instruments throughout the band's existence, in an attempt to create what they felt would be the ultimate bass and guitar.\n\nIn 1988, they formed The Doyle Fan Club in order to promote the new project and stay in touch with fans of The Misfits. According to various interviews conducted at the time, and a series of fan club letters written by Jerry Only (as \"Mo The Great\") from 1988 to 1990, Kryst the Conqueror was meant to be Only's vision of the \"perfect\" band. He hoped the \"righteous\" message of the band would reach out to fans, especially those who had followed former Misfits frontman, Glenn Danzig's post-Misfits career with the bands Samhain and Danzig – bands which Jerry felt were satanic, evil and possibly damaging to impressionable youths.\n\nA full album, \"Deliver Us From Evil\", was recorded, although it has never been officially released in its entirety. Instead, five of the album's tracks were released in 1990 as an EP for a special Christmas package. The band never had an official lead singer, although noted Yngwie Malmsteen vocalist, Jeff Scott Soto, was hired to record vocals for the album. Although it has been rumoured for many years that Soto was under contract with Malmsteen this is in fact untrue. Soto set the record straight in an interview about his time recording the vocals for their debut in March 2015, he was billed on the EP as \"Kryst the Conqueror\"). Also, Dave \"The Snake\" Sabo did a guest guitar solo on the song \"Spellbound.\"\n\nThough the band never played live, Kryst the Conqueror survived as a non-active band until 1995, at which time Jerry and Doyle reached an out of court settlement with Glenn Danzig, granting them the rights to perform as The Misfits. Kryst the Conqueror was then quickly revamped into what would become the second incarnation of The Misfits. Some Kryst the Conqueror songs were eventually re-written into songs for the \"resurrected\" Misfits.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at the dissenting academy at Daventry, where for seven years he acted as assistant tutor. After three years spent in a charge at Worcester, he returned as head of Daventry Academy, a post which he continued to hold till 1789, when, having adopted Unitarian principles, he resigned.

His joint executors were Thomas Field Gibson and his father.\n\nBelsham's beliefs reflect that transition that the Unitarian movement was going through during his lifetime, particularly from the early Bible-fundamentalist views of earlier English Unitarians like Henry Hedworth (who introduced the word \"Unitarian\" into print in English from Dutch sources in 1673) and John Biddle, to the more Bible-critical positions of Priestley's generation. Belsham adopted critical ideas on the Pentateuch by 1807, the Gospels by 1819, and Genesis by 1821. Later, following Priestley, Belsham was to dismiss the virgin birth as \"no more entitled to credit, than the fables of the Koran, or the reveries of Swedenborg.\" (1806)\n\nBelsham's first work of importance, \"Review of Mr Wilberforces Treatise entitled Practical View\" (1798), was written after his conversion to Unitarianism. His most popular work was \"the Evidences of Christianity\"; the most important was his translation and exposition of \"the Epistles of St Paul\" (1822). He was also the author of a work on philosophy, \"Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind\" (1801), which is entirely based on Hartley's psychology.\n\nIn 1812 Belsham published the \"Memoirs of the Late Reverend Theophilus Lindsey, M.A.\", his predecessor at Essex Street. This included a chapter titled \"American Unitarianism\" arguing that many American clergy entertained Unitarian views. The Calvinist minister Jedidiah Morse published the chapter separately, as part of his campaign against New England's liberal ministers—contributing to \"the Unitarian Controversy\" (1815) that eventually produced permanent schism among New England's Congregationalist churches.\n\nHis main Christological work was \"A Calm Inquiry into the Scripture Doctrine concerning the Person of Christ\" (1817).\n\nBelsham was one of the most vigorous and able writers of his church, and the \"Quarterly Review\" and Gentlemans Magazine of the early years of the 19th century abound in evidences that his abilities were recognized by his opponents.\n\n[Thomas Belsham et al.,] \"The New Testament\", An improved version upon the basis of Archbishop Newcome's new translation with a corrected text and notes critical and explanatory.

In a career that spanned the 1940s and 1950s, she appeared in several films and radio programs, and entertained the troops during World War II and the Korean War on USO tours with Bob Hope.\n\nMaxwell was a native of Clarinda, Iowa. During the 1930s, she worked as an usher in Fort Wayne, Indiana at the Rialto Theater located at 2616 South Calhoun Street. \nIn Fort Wayne, she attended Central High School. She dropped out of school in her sophomore year to join an Indianapolis band as a singer.\n\nShe started her professional entertaining career as a radio singer and also singing on stage with Ted Weems' big band while still a teenager, before signing with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1942 as a contract player. Among the radio programs in which she appeared were \"Beat the Band\" and \"The Abbott and Costello Show\". The head of MGM, Louis B. Mayer, insisted she change the \"Marvel\" part of her real name. She dropped her first name and kept the middle one. Some of her film roles included \"Lost in a Harem\" (1944), \"Champion\" (1949), \"The Lemon Drop Kid\" (1951), film noir classic \"New York Confidential\" (1955) and \"Rock-A-Bye Baby\" (1958). The eventual popular Christmas carol \"Silver Bells\" made its debut in \"The Lemon Drop Kid\", sung by Maxwell and Hope.\n\nMaxwell appeared twice as a singer in the second season (1955–56) of NBC's \"The Jimmy Durante Show\".\n\nMaxwell married three times; each ended in divorce. In September 1944, she married actor John Conte; the relationship was dissolved in June 1946. Her second marriage, to restaurateur Anders McIntyre, lasted just over a year, from January 1, 1950 until March 23, 1951. Maxwell's six-year marriage to writer/producer Jerry Davis ended in 1960. Her only child, Matthew, was born to Maxwell and Davis in 1956. \n\nMaxwell met and became friends with Frank Sinatra when they crossed paths both of them in separate nationally renowned\nbig bands in the late 1930s. Their friendship continued after Marilyn gave up singing for acting and moved to Hollywood and \nFrank had relocated from New Jersey to Beverly Hills in the early 1940s. By 1945 the friendship had progressed into an\nextra-marital affair. Seeing evidence that could lead her to no other conclusion than infidelity, Frank's then wife Nancy \n(Marilyn was wearing expensive diamond bracelet Nancy had earlier seen in Frank's car and assumed was for her) ordered Marilyn\nand husband John Conte to immediately leave The Sinatra Family Christmas Gala of 1945. Confronted after the party by Nancy,\nFrank admitted to the affair but claimed it was only casual not serious. Soon after Marilyn and Frank ended their sexual\nliaison.\n\nBetween 1950-1954 Marilyn had an ongoing affair with actor/comedian Bob Hope. Although he was married at the time to singer Dolores Reade Hope, Bob and Marilyn's relationship was so open many in Hollywood referred to her as \"Mrs. Bob Hope\".\n\nDuring the 1950s Marilyn became good friends with fellow actor Rock Hudson. After her marriage to Jerry Davis ended in 1960 at the arrangement of Hudson's agent Henry Wilson, Marilyn became one of several women Hudson publicly 'dated' to counter rumors (admitted true by him later in life) of the actor's homosexuality. No real romance between Ms Maxwell and Mr Hudson ever actually existed however.\n\nOn March 20, 1972, at age 50, Maxwell was found dead in her home by her 15-year-old son, who had arrived home from school. The cause was an apparent heart attack; she had been treated for hypertension and pulmonary disease. Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Jack Benny were honorary pallbearers at her funeral.\n\n\n"}

It is near Dartford and the Bluewater shopping centre to the west and Gravesend to the east. The station is part of the Thames Gateway urban regeneration, a project of national priority. It stands on the High Speed 1 rail line, around south-west of Northfleet railway station and the Stonebridge Road area of Northfleet. The station lies off the A2 trunk road, about from its junction with the M25 motorway. During the London 2012 Olympics, it served as a primary park-and-rail service as it is very close to the M25 motorway, allowing easy access for over 10 million commuters.\n\nEbbsfleet International is owned by HS1 Ltd, which acquired a 30-year concession to own and operate the High Speed 1 railway and the stations St Pancras railway station, Stratford International, Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International.\n\nThe name Ebbsfleet is an artificial creation of seventeenth-century antiquaries, partly inspired by the name of Ebbsfleet in Thanet, to the east.\n\nThe station opened to the public on 19 November 2007 for people travelling on Eurostar, later than St Pancras International because the security equipment was transferred from Waterloo International. The station was formally opened to Eurostar and dedicated in a ceremony by Dame Kelly Holmes on 29 January 2008.\n\n\"Ebbsfleet International Station\" was the name originally proposed for the station, but \"Dartford International Station\" was later proposed at the urging of Eurostar, who felt that Dartford was a name with greater national recognition. Opposition to Eurostar's ‘Dartford International’ proposal came from Gravesham Borough Council, whose administrative centre at Gravesend is just two miles () away (even though Ebbsfleet International is in the borough of Dartford and therefore outside Gravesham council's authority); Southfleet Parish Council; and Swanscombe and Greenhithe Town Council, both in the Borough of Dartford. The similarity of its name to that of Dartford railway station, away, was also of concern.\n\nThe Olympic Javelin or Javelin was a high-speed train shuttle service operated by Southeastern over High Speed 1 during the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The service ran for the duration of both games, between St Pancras International station and this station, via Stratford International station, which is close to the Olympic Park. During the Summer Olympics a service of eight trains an hour ran between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, calling at Stratford, replacing the usual East Kent highspeed service. Two of these were extended to Ashford and one to Faversham. Between 11pm and 1am the service between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet was increased to twelve per hour.\n\nOn High Speed 1 there are avoiding lines in each direction and four platforms, two serving international Eurostar services and two the Southeastern High-speed services. Southeastern services travelling between London and the North Kent Line use a junction to the north of the station and are served by another pair of platforms that curve away to the east.\n\nTicket barriers control access to all platforms.\n\nThis station has bilingual signage, both in French and English. It is one of the relatively few stations in England to have bilingual signage, others being Wallsend (Latin), Southall (Punjabi), Hereford (Welsh), St Pancras and Ashford International (French).\n\nThe Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) Act allows a total of 9,000 car parking spaces to be constructed, with an initial 6,000 built. The car parks are in a number of areas around the station - north of the North Kent Line, between the North Kent Line and High Speed 1, south of the High Speed 1 and south west of the station building.\n\nThe station is served by Fastrack buses operated by Arriva Southern Counties, which connect it to Dartford, Bluewater, Greenhithe, Swanscombe and Gravesend. Despite being in close proximity to the station, Northfleet has no bus connection to the station.\n\nThere is a taxi rank directly outside the station entrance/exit. Car rental services for both leisure and business are located in the concourse. The interchange facilities lie at either end of the main station box - taxis, buses and set down at the northern end (to also serve the NKL platforms) and coaches to the south of the station box.\nIt was formerly planned that Crossrail would terminate at a separate station between Northfleet and Ebbsfleet International but under the current plan, Abbey Wood further west will be the eastern terminus. However, a Crossrail extension from Abbey Wood to Gravesend (Hoo Junction) remains safeguarded.\n\nNorthfleet railway station is approximately 400 metres to the north-east, although the walking distance between the two stations is significantly longer, approximately 2 km if roadside footpaths are followed. There is a shorter walking route (approximately 1,000 metres) through the car park to the north of Ebbsfleet station, but there are no footpaths provided and this way is obstructed by the car park access barriers. There are no specific pedestrian or cycle route signs for Ebbsfleet station on any of the possible routes between the stations. Gravesham Council acknowledges that the existing provision is inadequate, although it is a complex planning issue to resolve as whilst Northfleet is in Gravesham, Ebbsfleet station is just over the border in the Borough of Dartford, and there are many other stakeholders involved.\n\nAs of the Summer 2014 timetable, there are up to five Eurostar services to Paris on weekdays, four on Saturdays and three on Sundays. Most of these services run non-stop from Ebbsfleet to Paris, though a few also stop at Ashford en route. There are four trains to Brussels on weekdays, three on Saturdays and two on Sundays. All Brussels services call at Lille and some also call at Calais. There is also a single round trip service on most days to Marne-la-Vallée for the Disneyland Paris resort, which also calls at Ashford and Lille (in the France-bound direction only).\n\nIt is not permitted to use Eurostar services for domestic journeys in the UK. Since the station's opening, Eurostar has withheld passenger usage statistics for international services, citing commercial confidentiality.\n\nSince the opening of Ebbsfleet station in 2007, Eurostar has transferred a number of trips from Ashford to the newer station. Ashford International has a wider variety of destinations such as Calais, Lille, Brussels, Disneyland Paris, the French Alps, Paris, Lyon, Avignon and Marseille, but with fewer services to them. Whereas Ebbsfleet International, serves only the core destinations (Paris and Brussels and Lille) and the Disneyland Paris service, but with much more frequent services.\n\nOn 29 June 2009 Southeastern started a weekday preview service between and Ebbsfleet International, extending to during peak hours. On 7 September the service was enhanced by a few services to Ramsgate via or Dover. A regular service began on 13 December 2009.\n\nThe typical off-peak service was:\n\nAdditional trains, in peak hours only, serve , via the Medway towns, and .\n\nSince 2 January 2015 the off peak service is:\n\nThe Eurostar services as of May 2019:\n\n\n"}

It opens into the San Fernando Valley at the northwest and the San Gabriel Valley at the southeast. It is nearly bisected by the Verdugo Wash, a smaller valley separating the Verdugo Mountains from the San Rafael Hills. Most of the valley lies at an elevation of over 1,500 feet (450 m).\n\nCrescenta Valley was a pastoral area under the Rancho Tujunga, Rancho San Rafael and Rancho La Canada land grants during the Spanish and Mexican periods. The first American settler in the valley was Theodore Pickens, who settled at the top of today's Briggs Avenue in 1871. The western portion of Rancho La Canada, which included the major portion of the valley, was subdivided in 1881 into 10-acre parcels by Dr. Benjamin B. Briggs. Significant suburban residential development began with the opening of the Montrose subdivision in 1913, accelerating significantly after World War II. Today, the Crescenta Valley is a mature suburban area.\n\nThe name \"Crescenta\" does not derive from the Spanish word for \"crescent\", which is \"el creciente\". Benjamin Briggs coined the name from the English word \"crescent\" because he could see three crescent-shaped formations from his home, or because of the shape of the valley. The post office was established in 1888, with the Post Office adding the \"La\" to the name to distinguish it from Crescent City, California.\n\nIncorporated cities, districts of Los Angeles, districts of Glendale, and unincorporated census-designated places in the Crescenta Valley include:\n\n\nDaytime temperatures are generally 10 to 15 °F (6 to 8 °C) warmer than those in coastal regions during summer. Winter is somewhat colder than most L.A. area stations. Winter snow is rare, but not unknown on the valley floor. Because of proximity to the mountains, rainfall is generally higher than most Los Angeles area locations, averaging around 20 inches per year, mostly falling between November and March.\n\n"}
{"id": "2231586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231586", "title": "Anyang Halla", "text": "Anyang Halla\n\nAnyang Halla () is a professional ice hockey team based in Anyang in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. It is one of the founding and current members of the Asia League Ice Hockey (ALIH). Formed in 1994, it is the oldest professional ice hockey team, and one of only three professional teams, in South Korea. The Halla Group contributes three billion won annually to run the club.\n\nAt its inception the team was based out of Mok-dong, Seoul and named the Mando Winia. In 1998 the team took the name of Mando's parent company, Halla. After the collapse of the Korean Ice Hockey League in 2003 they were the only team to survive. They joined four Japanese teams to create the new Asia League Ice Hockey. In 2005 the team relocated and took the name of their new hometown as their own, playing all current home games out of the Anyang Sports Complex Arena. After two years of finishing in fifth place, they became the first non-Japanese team to finish first in the regular season in 2008–09. However, they failed to defeat the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi-finals. In the following season Halla again finished in first and won the semi-final and final series giving them their first play-off series win and first Asia League Championship.\nThe club captured their second AL title after the league cancelled the championship final due to the earthquake in Japan. Asia League announced Halla and Tohoku Free Blades as the co-champions.\n\nThe team was founded in 1994 by the Halla Group to help promote hockey in Korea. The Halla Group also felt that by creating an ice hockey team, it would help them to fulfill their role as a responsible corporation by providing something to the community. The team was originally named \"Mando Winia\". It was so named because Mando is a subsidiary company of Halla and Winia is a brand of air conditioner sold by the company. In 1997 the team was disbanded for a short time during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. However, the chairman of Halla Group, Chung Mong-won, fought to keep the team.\n\nAs a member of the Korean Ice Hockey League the team won the championship five times. During this time, the team also changed their name from \"Mando Winia\" to \"Halla Winia\". The team first looked at adding foreign players to their roster in late 2001 with other members of the Korean League. In 2003, the team was one of the founding members of Asia League Ice Hockey.\n\nWhile the team participates primarily in the Asia League, they also play in tournaments like the All Korea Ice Hockey Championship each year. In the inaugural year of Asia League Ice Hockey, Halla played a shortened seasons of only 16 games, and failed to break .500. In the following year they brought Esa Tikkanen, a veteran player of 20 NHL seasons, on board. He was brought on primarily to coach the players but he also played during the team's games. Tikkanen felt that as the players played against more skilled teams their own skill level showed greater improvement. He also felt that they should play more games and that the season was too short. That year the team was also noted for showing great improvement over the first year's effort. Halla finished the season winning 18 games out of 42 with 5 ties. Their top offensive player, Marco Poulsen, finished fifth in the overall points race, however they did not reach their goal that year of making the playoffs, finishing in fifth place one spot out of the playoffs. In the off-season the team changed their name from Anyang Halla Winia to Anyang Halla with the expiration of the sponsorship contract. As well they hired Otakar Vejvoda to be the team's new coach. Vejvoda was considered a legend in the Czech Extraliga both for his skill as a player and a coach.\n\nIn the 2005–06 season Halla improved on the previous year's performance finishing in second place. The league saw a reduced season of only 38 games. Song Dong-hwan was the leader in goals for the league with 31 and Patrik Martinec ranked second in assists with 44. Martinec ranked number two on the total points list while Song finished in fourth place. Halla also scored the most short-handed goals of any team in the league with 11. The city of Anyang won an award for being \"The best Hockey Town in Asia\". The team made the play-offs for the first time since the league's formation. They received a bye in the first round and played Kokudo, the winner of the third place and sixth place match-up. Anyang won only a single game out of the first three which were played on home ice. They were eliminated in the fourth game which was played in Kokudo's home rink by a score of 5–1. Kokudo went on to be the league champions for the second year in a row.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2005–06 season there were some roster changes. Two of the team's top players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon, had to report for compulsory military service. Starting goaltender, Kim Sung-Bae, retired after the previous season. Even though they were missing these players they were noted for having more players with more than 10 goals and 10 assists than in the previous season. With the departure of Song offensive output dropped slightly, the team's top offensive player finished seventh overall in goals with 21. However Martinec won the assists race with 53 and the overall points total with 71. The team shared top spot in the short-handed goals with 2 other teams, scoring 10 over the course of the season. With a further shortened season of only 34 games the team finished in fifth place and faced the other Korean team, Kangwon Land in the quarter finals. During the regular season Kangwon won six of seven meetings, and the quarter finals were no different. Kangwon swept Halla in three games, the final game ending in 3–2 with a last minute desperate bid by Halla to tie the game.\nThe next season saw the AL further reduce the number of games played to just 30. In the pre-season Halla won the Anyang Cup, which is a pre-season tournament held in Anyang. The team's record in the regular season remained relatively the same and they finished again in fifth place. Lee Yu-Won was the top offensive player with 16 goals and was tied for fourth place with three other players. Martinec continued to contribute many assists to the team and finished in second place with 29, one point off first. He finished in fourth place in the overall point totals. Halla did not have another player in the top 10. The team once again led the league in short-handed goals and gave up the fewest short-handed goals against along with the Oji Eagles. In the playoffs the Halla faced the Nippon Paper Cranes in the first round. During the regular season the two teams split their series, each winning two games. The playoffs told a different story, and Nippon swept Halla in three games. Halla lost each game by a single goal. Vejvoda praised Nippon's goalie for his excellent play and commended his players for their effort.\n\nFollowing the defeat in the post-season Halla replaced Vejvoda as head coach with Shim Eui-Sik. Shim had spent his entire professional career playing for Halla and during the 2007–2008 season he was the coach of Little Halla. As a player Shim had 30 points in 80 games. He vowed to reorganize the team and set his sights on a league championship. The team's general manager also hired Samuel H. Kim, then an analyst for SBS Sports and previously an NHL reporter from Vancouver, as a scout for the organization. Halla moved away from the heavy Czech influence which had previously dominated the team and filled three of the four spots for foreign players on the team with players from North America. Brock Radunske, Brad Fast and Jon Awe became the first three players from North America to play for the team. They also arranged for Eric Thurston, the head coach of University of Alberta's team, to spend the first three weeks of the training camp assisting the new coach and new North American players. Martinec was the only Czech player to remain on the team. In addition to the new foreigner players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon returned from military service. In the 2008 pre-season Anyang Cup, Halla finished fourth out of five teams. The AL increased the number of regular season games for the 2008–09 season to 36. In September head coach Shim was suspended for five games for refusal to play. The incident stemmed from a goal that was scored as the final buzzer sounded during a 21 September game against High1. Halla entered the dressing room and refused to return to the ice. The league considered the game a forfeit. Anyang Halla finished the season in first place with a total of 76 points. Their defeat of their rivals High1 in the final game of the season marks the first time a non-Japanese team had finished first place in the Asia League. Brock Radunske captured the titles for both the most goals scored with 29 and most points on the season with 57. Martinec finished in second place for the second year in a row in the assists category with 47. Overall the team finished with five players in the top ten in the overall points tally. For the first time the team ended the season with the number one powerplay scoring 54 goals. In contrast to earlier seasons the team did not lead the league in short-handed goals, ranking in the middle of the pack both in goals for and against. They were the only team not shutout during the regular season. After receiving a bye in the first round of the play-offs Halla had to face the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi-final. They returned to Anyang for game six of the series leading 3–2. They were expected to win the series but Nippon's Ilmura scored two game-winning goals and the Japanese club defeated Anyang in 7 games.\n\nHalla opened the 2009–10 season with a loss on home ice, but at the midpoint of the season they were tied for first place with the Oji Eagles. The league maintained the number of games at 36. The first half of the season saw Halla plagued with injuries. Particularly hard hit were the team's foreign imports. After the third game of the season Jon Awe was diagnosed with a sports hernia that required surgery and was scheduled to miss 8–12 weeks. On 29 November, Brad Fast received a knee injury that would sideline him for 4–6 months, ending his season. Brock Radunske was also on the injury list with a concussion, while Patrik Martinec was day to day with a lower-body injury. Halla replaced Awe quickly with Dustin Wood, who has played in both the American Hockey League and Deutsche Eishockey Liga. Fast was replaced by Lee Don-ku from Yonsei University. Halla also had several other regular players injured including Kim Won-jun, Kim Kyu-hun, and Lee Seung-yup. After 18 games Halla led the league with 94 goals. On 31 January 2010 Halla defeated the Oji Eagles in overtime by a score of 4–3, clinching first place for the second year in a row. The win also set up a semi-final match-up against Korean rivals High1, guaranteeing that a Korean team would appear in the final for the first time in league history. Halla won all of their series against opposing teams, except against their rival High1. Of 18 possible points available in their six-game series, Halla took only eight. They were the only team to win a series against the Nippon Paper Cranes. The team led the league in goals scored with 180. Individually, Kim Ki-sung led the team in goals scored with 22, while Patrik Martinec again led with 40 assists and 51 points. Halla finished with five players in the top ten point list. The team also led in both powerplay goals for, with 57, powerplay percentage, with 34.97%, and shorthanded goals for, with 10. In the annual end of season awards, Patrik Martinec took the award for Most Valuable Player and Best Playmaking. Cho Min-ho took the award for Young Guy of the Year. Anyang city won the award for Best Hockey Town for the second time for their spirit and sell-out crowds. Anyang Halla defeated High1 by a score of 5–2 to win the semi-finals three games to one, winning their first play-off series and becoming the first Korean team to play for the Championship Cup. Halla faced the Cranes, who had knocked them out of the playoffs twice, in the final. The series went to the full five games and four of the games went to overtime. Brock Radunske scored two overtime winners and assisted Kim Woo-Jae in scoring the overtime winner in game five, making Halla the first non-Japanese team to win the Asia League Championship. Radunske was named MVP while head coach Shim was named \"Coach of the Year\". After retiring as a player, Martinec signed a 1-year deal to work as an assistant coach on the team.\n\nLike the previous season, Halla lost the opening game against High1. However, they once again found themselves on top at the midpoint of the season. The team was second in the league in goals scored with 65. Halla retained Dustin Wood who was brought in as a replacement in the previous season. On 14 November 2010 the team defended their Korea Domestic Championship title against High1 by defeating them 5–1 in the final game of the week-long tournament. After finishing first two consecutive years, Halla finished in fourth place one point behind the Free Blades. They won their season series against all teams except the Cranes and Eagles. They also finished fifth in goals scored with 130, one behind High1, but allowed the second fewest goals with 94, three behind the Eagles. While the team's penalty kill was ranked fifth in the league, they were tied for the most short-handed goals with the Cranes with six goals. Their powerplay was ranked third, and they gave up the second fewest short-handed goals. Brock Radunske led the team with 20 goals and finished fourth in the league. Cho Min-ho also made the top ten ranking and finished in eight place with 18 goals. Kim Ki-sung was the only Halla player to make the top ten in assists and finished in tenth place with 27. Overall Cho Min-ho led the team with 44 points and finished ninth in the league. Dustin Wood led the team in penalty minutes with 45. With their fourth-place finish, Halla had to face the Eagles in the first round of the playoffs. The series began in Japan, but Halla took two of three games and upon returning to South Korea they won the fourth game of the best-of-five series and knocked the Eagles out. The Free Blades defeated the Cranes and Halla were set to face them on 12 March 2011 in Sendai, Japan. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck the Sendai area about one hour after the team landed there to prepare for the games. The League immediately cancelled the three games scheduled in Sendai and on 22 March 2011 they officially cancelled the final series, award co-championship titles to both Anyang Halla and Tohoku Free Blades. This decision made Halla only the second team to capture back-to-back championships since the league's inception.\n\nAs a team and organization the Halla have engaged in charitable work. In 2008 they had two charity games on 27 and 28 December. The admission fee was waved and instead fans were asked to make donations. The proceeds were donated to the poor children of Anyang city as well as the sick children's hospital. On 19 December 2009 The Anyang Halla organization donated 20,000 won for each goal that had been scored in the season to charity, totaling just over 2 million won. On 25 and 26 December 2010 Halla repeated their charity game series, and offered free admission to the game in exchange for donations to the sick children's hospitals in Gyeonggi Province. After the cancellation of the final series, the team held a charity game on 22 March 2011 to raise money for the Japanese earthquake victims. Instead of raising a trophy to celebrate their championship, the team took a final photo holding signs of sympathy and encouragement for Japan. The team raised almost 20 million won in donations for Japan. The team maintains a yearly tradition of giving free admission to students who take the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to promote rest and comfort after the difficult exam.\n\nThe Anyang Halla Hockey Club launched a new radio broadcast deal in 2007 with Afreeca.com. On 11 May 2009, SBSsports acquired a 5-year broadcast contract with the club.\n\nThe Anyang Sports Complex Ice Arena () was opened on 24 November 2000. It seats 1,284 spectators. The Arena also contains a basketball court and is home to the Anyang KGC. It has a seating for 6,690 people. The ice rink is also used for short track and figure skating among other sports. The team previously used the Mok-dong Ice Rink.\n\nThe Anyang Halla logo features a black triangle in the background surrounded by a white and black border. A growling polar bear is shown protruding from the top half of the triangle and underneath the team name \"Halla\" is shown in stylized gold letters. Below the team name is a semicircular shape which contains the city name \"Anyang\" in white letters on a blue background.\n\nAs the team changed its name from the Winia to the Halla the uniforms had minor changes made to them. The logo changed names and the uniforms had colored shoulders removed from them. The current home jerseys feature a solid blue background with yellow stripes on the cuffs and bottom of the body as well as a number of blue rough shapes behind the gold trim as well as sponsor logos on the shoulders. The away jerseys feature a solid white background with dark blue striped borders on the cuffs and bottom of the body, it also contains the same rough blue shapes behind the trim. The Halla put the first name of Korean players on the jerseys to avoid confusion as several players share the same family name.\n\nThe teams mascots are a male and female polar bear. The male polar bear wears the Halla home jersey and the female polar bear wears the away jersey. She also wears a white skirt and has red eyes. No name has been released for either of the polar bears. In February 2012 the team began an event to choose a name for the male mascot with the name to be announced at the end of the season.\n\na: Shared with Tohoku Free Blades.\n\nAs of the 2018–19 season. The statistics are counted for Asia League games only.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the 2008–09 season, Halla drew most of their imports from the Czech Republic, including their head coach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The villa is now home to NYU Florence.\n\nVilla La Pietra was bought and somewhat modified in the 1460s by the Florentine banker Francesco Sassetti. In 1545 or 1546 it was sold to the . The villa was given its present form in the seventeenth century by the cardinal Luigi Capponi, possibly with the assistance of Carlo Fontana. During the brief period from 1865 to 1871 when Florence was capital of the Kingdom of Italy, the villa was used as the embassy of Prussia.\n\nIn 1903 Arthur Acton, an Anglo-Neapolitan art dealer, rented it after his marriage to Hortense Mitchell, the daughter of a banker from Chicago, Illinois, William Mitchell. With money from her family, the couple bought the villa in 1907.\n\nThe villa contains the art collection assembled by the Actons, which reflects twentieth-century Anglo-American taste. It is used for didactic purposes by New York University. The collection includes works from the circle of Giotto, Romanesque sculptures, a relief of the \"Virgin and Child\" by Donatello, and fifteenth-century tapestries made for the de' Medici family.\n\nBetween 1905 and 1930 the gardens of the villa were substantially altered by the Actons, only the walled lemon garden to the north-west of the villa remaining mostly unchanged since the time of Luigi Capponi. The Actons laid out a formal Baroque Italian garden with extensive stonework, including almost two hundred statues, many of them by the Venetian sculptors Orazio Marinali and Antonio Bonazza, brought to Florence from the villas of the Brenta. The gardens were restored in the early years of the twenty-first century.\n"}

The leaves are often covered with holes caused by the caterpillar of the kawakawa looper moth (\"Cleora scriptaria\"). The images depict the variety \"majus\" which has larger and more glossy leaves than \"P. excelsum\". The name \"kawakawa\" comes from the Māori language, where it refers to the bitter taste of the leaves, from \"kawa\" or bitter.\n\nKawakawa leaves are about 5–10 cm long by 6–12 cm wide; they are opposite to each other, broadly rounded with a short drawn-out tip and are heart-shaped at their bases. The leaves are deep green in colour if growing in the forest, but may be yellowish-green in more open situations.\n\nThe flowers are produced on greenish, erect spikes 2.5–7.5 cm long. Kawakawa flowers are quite minute and very closely placed around the spike. After pollination the flowers gradually swell and become fleshy to form small, berry-like fruits that are yellow to bright orange.\n\nEach berry cluster is the size of a small finger. Ripening period is January and February. These fruits are favoured by kererū or New Zealand pigeon (\"Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae\") and tui (\"Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae\").\n\nKawakawa is a traditional medicinal plant of the Māori. An infusion is made from the leaves or roots, and used for bladder problems, boils, bruises, to relieve pain or toothache, or as a general tonic. The sweet edible yellow berries (most often found in summer on female trees) of the plant were eaten as a diuretic.\n\nIt also is important in cultural contexts: host people of a marae wave leaves of kawakawa to welcome guests. At a tangi, both hosts and guests may wear wreaths of kawakawa on the head as a sign of mourning.\n\nIt is commonly grown as an ornamental plant in gardens.\nKawakawa is sometimes called \"Māori kava\" and is often confused with the kava plant (\"Piper methysticum\"). While the two plants look similar and have similar names, they are different, albeit related, species.\n\nKava is a traditional plant and beverage of the South Pacific. The roots of the plant are used to produce a drink with medicinal, sedative, anesthetic, euphoriant, and entheogenic properties. It is most likely not a coincidence that this plant has a similar name to kawakawa. One source stated: \"In New Zealand, where the climate is too cold for kava, the Maori gave the name kawa-kawa to another Piperaceae, \"M. excelsum\", in memory of the kava plants they undoubtedly brought with them and unsuccessfully attempted to cultivate. The Māori word kawa also means \"ceremonial protocol\", recalling the stylised consumption of the drug typical of Polynesian societies.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The Tour began in Fromentine with an individual time trial on 2 July and Stage 11 occurred on 13 July with a mountainous stage to Briançon. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, on 24 July.\n\n2 July 2005 — Fromentine to Noirmoutier-en-l'Île, (ITT)\n\nThe winning time of David Zabriskie was set early in the day – so early, in fact, that virtually none of the TV stations covering the Tour actually showed it. Zabriskie, who has also won a stage in the Vuelta a España and a time trial in the Giro d'Italia, put a powerful time in that few could approach. The best attempt was a run by Alexander Vinokourov, a teammate of Jan Ullrich, who came in 53 seconds back, putting him, for a time, in second place. Most of the other big names rode respectably, as with Landis, though Iban Mayo wound up four minutes behind the other GC contenders – a disappointment to be sure. Also disappointing was Joseba Beloki, who demonstrated that he has not returned to the form he had before his crash in the 2003 Tour.\n\nThe big names this Tour, though, were expected to be Ivan Basso, Jan Ullrich, and, of course, Lance Armstrong – the final three starters. Basso performed respectably, coming in 18th, 1:53 back from Zabriskie – a perfectly respectable showing for someone who is not known as a time trialist. Ullrich also did well in 12th place, 1:12 back, especially considering that the day before he got into a gruesome crash with his team car in which he shattered the rear window as he flew through it. The real story, though, was Lance Armstrong, whose time trialing skills this year had been in doubt after a poor showing in the Tour de Georgia. After a small mishap where his foot fell out of the pedal at the start, he rode an incredible time trial, bridging the one-minute gap to Jan Ullrich with 3 km remaining. He finished two seconds behind Zabriskie, sending a clear message to anyone who thought he might be off form this year.\n\nAs for the other jerseys, Zabriskie won the first green sprinter's jersey, while the winner of the previous year's prologue, Swiss Fabian Cancellara, got the white young rider's jersey.\n\n3 July 2005 — Challans to Les Essarts, \n\nA textbook Tour day – an early break of László Bodrogi (Crédit Agricole), David Cañada (Saunier Duval-Prodir), Thomas Voeckler (Bouygues Télécom), and Sylvain Calzati (Ag2r-Prevoyance) got away and was caught at the end. This led to a bunch sprint, with a strangely lackluster McEwen holding on for third as a rock-solid Tom Boonen blasted to his 15th win of the year, and to the green jersey, which he claimed from Zabriskie, although today, in a rare occurrence, Lance Armstrong was wearing it, since Zabriskie also had the yellow jersey, which meant the green went \"on loan\" to Armstrong, who was second. Bodrogi racked up enough time bonuses on the intermediate sprints to pass Vinokourov in the standings for third place, 47 seconds behind Zabriskie, who held his yellow jersey. All but three of the riders finished in the peloton, making time bonuses the only things that shuffled the standings at all. In the last kilometres, the main group broke, and most of the General Classification contenders (except Jan Ullrich) came in nine seconds after Boonen. The break-up, however, was caused by a fall, and the judges applied the same time to them as the first group.\n\nThe real stand-out story of the day was Thomas Voeckler, who masterfully attacked on the small category 4 climb to win the small number of points in the mountain competition that were up for the day. Since those were the only mountain points around, though, Voeckler managed to put himself in polka dots, meaning the young French rider has now worn three of the four leader jerseys in the Tour de France in his career.\n\n4 July 2005 — La Châtaigneraie to Tours, \n\nA normal day with some minor drama at the finish, the early break this time consisted of Erik Dekker (Rabobank), Rubens Bertogliati (Saunier Duval), and Nicolas Portal (AG2R), who were caught 1 km from the end. Dekker had already managed a great feat at Tours the previous season by holding off the peloton after being in a breakaway for 200 kilometres, and winning the Paris-Tours. This time, however, the French city did not bring luck to the Dutchman. After the breakaways were reeled in, the Swiss time trial champion Fabian Cancellara attempted an escape in the last kilometer, but was brought back, leading to a bunch sprint. Commentators expected that the long, straight drive to the finish would favour Robbie McEwen, but instead it was Tom Boonen who took a convincing win.\n\nAt the finish line Robbie McEwen was reprimanded for trying to push Stuart O'Grady away with his head, a move possibly spurred on by O'Grady preventing him from attacking Boonen by blocking his path. Although McEwen crossed the line third, the judges knocked him to the back of the main pack, giving him a place of 186th, and dealing quite a blow to his hopes of a fourth green jersey, placing him 44 points behind Tom Boonen, who has 70.\n\nThe general classification remained unchanged, and Cancellara held his young rider's jersey, although if Tom Boonen gets another stage win time bonus, it would go to him. Meanwhile, the early break crossed two of the three category four climbs first, giving Dekker six mountain points. Voeckler could only manage to cross an early climb in second, giving him two more and bringing him up to five, putting Erik Dekker in polka dots. Dekker also won the prize of most combative rider.\n\n5 July 2005 — Tours to Blois, (TTT)\n\nThis was a nail-biter of a team time trial in which the teams of the three favorites – Armstrong, Ullrich, and Basso – all did well. Discovery trailed CSC in the team standings, and so launched second to last, but showed their usual team time trial form with a pencil-straight line, each member taking pulls like clockwork. As the time trial wore on, Armstrong began taking longer pulls at the front, bringing the pace of the pack up dramatically. Even still, CSC, launching behind them, kept a grueling pace of their own, actually leading Discovery through all of the checkpoints. The race wasn't decided until the last kilometer and a half, when yellow jersey David Zabriskie crashed as his knee hit the handlebar, probably because of his cycle chain malfunctioning. He got back on and crossed the line in a blood-stained yellow jersey 1'28\" behind the Discovery riders. On the other hand, Ullrich, whose T-Mobile Team crossed the line at 35\", lost only 30\" due to the \"adjusted\" gap for the team trial stage. He's currently in 14th place, 1'36\" off Armstrong.\n\nHad Zabriskie held on another half a kilometer he would have gotten the same time as the rest of CSC, but instead he dropped to ninth in the overall standings, and CSC's surprise at the yellow jersey hitting the pavement in front of them cost them two seconds on Discovery – ironically, the exact margin by which Zabriskie had led Armstrong going into the stage. The result was to put Armstrong in his 67th yellow jersey, and to put teammate Yaroslav Popovych in the white jersey. With no sprints or mountains, the green and polka dot jerseys remained on the shoulders of Tom Boonen and Erik Dekker, respectively.\n\n<nowiki>* </nowiki>This means that even though the team finished with a longer time, the provision set forth in the Tour de France Guideline states that the gaps for the team trial stage is capped according to the relative finishing position of the teams. Thus, even though Gerolsteiner and Illes Balears-Caisse D'Epargne finished at the same time, for the riders in those two teams, IBC riders have a 10\" advantage over the GST riders for the individual classifications.\n\n6 July 2005 — Chambord to Montargis, \n\nJuan Antonio Flecha made an early break, and was joined 90 km later by László Bodrogi (Crédit Agricole), Salvatore Commesso (Lampre), and Kjell Carlström (Liquigas), but not by George Hincapie, whose team had earlier said they wanted to put him into a break to give him a turn in yellow. The break was finally reeled in 10 km from the finish by a Discovery-led peloton, setting up the sprint. It was a tough, uphill sprint, and McEwen took it by a wheel over Tom Boonen, taking his first win of the Tour, but still only putting him in fourth for the green jersey due to his being relegated to 186th in the third stage.\n\nDavid Zabriskie recovered enough from his crash to start today, and finished with the peloton in 176th place. Out of respect for the role his crash played in the overall standings, Lance Armstrong initially refused to wear the yellow jersey today, and it was not until the race was stopped as it was rolling out of the neutral zone so that the organizers would ask him to wear it that he agreed to.\n\nToday also saw the first withdrawal of the Tour as Constantino Zaballa of Saunier Duval-Prodir failed to finish the stage. The Yellow, Green, Polka and White jerseys remain on their respective riders.\n\n7 July 2005 — Troyes to Nancy, \n\nAn early escape initiated by Christophe Mengin (Française des Jeux) after 24 km was accompanied by Karsten Kroon (Rabobank), Jaan Kirsipuu (Crédit Agricole), Mauro Gerosa (Liquigas-Bianchi) and Stéphane Augé (Cofidis). Karsten Kroon and Stéphane Augé took 7 mountain points each, with Kroon winning the last mountain, which results in the Dutch rider wearing the polka dot jersey, keeping it in team Rabobank. Around 10 km from the finish, the breakaway was broken in pieces after an attack of Estonian champion Kirsipuu, but Mengin, a rider local to Nancy, managed to hold on and left Kirsipuu behind. One and a half kilometers from the end, Alexander Vinokourov and Lorenzo Bernucci came off the peloton to join him, and then, 700 meters from the end, Mengin risked too much, slid out and crashed, followed independently by much of the front of the peloton. The result was to give Bernucci the stage, due mostly to his superior navigation of the crash, and Vinokourov a 19-second boost in the general classification. Boonen kept the green jersey, but Hushovd's fifth-place finish gave him a substantial boost, putting him just 7 points back in that competition. Claudio Corioni of abandoned the race.\n\n8 July 2005 — Lunéville to Karlsruhe, \n\nBecause the Tour arrived to the German city of Karlsruhe, it was clear that at least one German rider would try to win. It was Fabian Wegmann who attacked very early and gathered all the mountain points available before the peloton began his pursuit. Even though the main field flew through the French countryside propelled by Quick Step and Davitamon-Lotto, Wegmann managed to enter Germany ahead of the group, but he was eventually reeled in. This time it was Tom Boonen who sprinted too early, and he gave Robbie McEwen the chance of a second stage win in this year's Tour de France. Wegmann had gathered enough points to make him leader of the mountain's classification and receive the polka-dot jersey on the podium in front of the German public.\n\n9 July 2005 — Pforzheim to Gérardmer, \n\nStage 8 is a stage that takes the riders from Germany back into French territory. Overnight saw two riders drop out of the race, which meant at the day's start there were 183 riders still in the race. The day's stage saw four cat-3 climbs at the beginning of the stage and the first cat-2 climb of this year's race towards the end of the stage. In between the last cat-3 and the cat-2 climb the stage was relatively flat, which was supposed to benefit the sprinters more than the climbers.\n\nEarly during the race, the peloton moved at a rapid pace, causing a number of riders to drop from the main peloton. Early attacks were mostly caught, save for a group of seven riders which maintained lead towards the end. A group determined to catch the riders was attacked by Vinokourov, followed by Savoldelli; when the Italian cracked and Armstrong was left alone, the chase group with about 32 people was formed, including Ullrich, Voigt, Basso, and McGee. Taking advantage of Armstrong's solitude, another member of , Andreas Klöden, attacked and escaped, reaching the last remaining member of the breakaway. Towards the summit of the cat-2 climb, Weening and Klöden had a 17\" lead over the chase group, and they were able to maintain the lead over the group when they crossed the finish line.\n\nBecause Weening and Klöden crossed the line at virtually the same time, the jury had to use the sensor system to determine the winner. Weening was declared the stage winner, beating out Klöden by 0.0002 of a second, or 9.6 millimeters. At the stage's end, Armstrong still holds the yellow jersey, although there was a lot of movement at the top 10 of the \"classement général\". Popovych, the white jersey holder, was dropped out of the chase group and as a consequence fell out of top 10 and relinquished the white jersey to Karpets, who leads the youth classification by 1\". The polka dot jersey also changed owner, as Rasmussen took 32 points out of a maximum 36 in this stage. Stage 1 winner David Zabriskie was dropped on the first climb, finished the stage in last place (51'12\" off the leader) and barely escaped the fate of DNF.\n\nFurthermore, Armstrong was isolated from his team, because none of his team-mates was able to follow the attacks in the group of the favourites, mainly the attacks of Vinokourov.\n\n10 July 2005 — Gérardmer to Mulhouse, \n\nThis stage featured three cat-3 mountains followed by the cat-2 Grand Ballon, cat-3 and finally the cat-1 climb up the Ballon d'Alsace, first crossed in the 1905 Tour de France. The terrain was designed so the challengers of the polka dot jersey had to make a move.\n\nFrom the beginning of the stage there were attacks. A group of riders managed to escape the peloton. Michael Rasmussen was a part of this group in the beginning and according to the team he lost two minutes on the previous stage on purpose so that he wouldn't be a threat to the general classification and then would be able to do this attack in order to take mountain points, his main aim for this Tour. Rasmussen and Dario Cioni very quickly escaped the original group and carried on as a duo. Cioni had trouble following Rasmussen over the mountains and eventually gave up. Meanwhile, the original breakout group was reduced to Christophe Moreau and Jens Voigt. Moreau was a contender for the polka dot jersey and Voigt was in position for the yellow jersey, so they both had an interest in chasing Rasmussen. He however kept the distance even though he had been riding alone for almost the entire stage and won the stage. Moreau and Voigt came in three minutes later, which gave Voigt the yellow jersey.\n\n12 July 2005 — Grenoble to Courchevel, \n\nThe start of the stage was delayed by as much as 40 minutes because of a protest staged by farmers who were angry over wolves being reintroduced to the Alps. Even though had shown some signs of weakness in the stage won by Weening, it was the American team which lead the peloton in pursuit of a breakaway which contained Óscar Pereiro, Jörg Jaksche and some other riders. Even though most of Discovery's team fell back quite soon, Yaroslav Popovych prepared a brutal attack for his leader. The peloton broke and only Rasmussen, Valverde and Mancebo could hold Armstrong's wheel. Even though they did not collaborate with the American, a gap formed between this group, then Basso and then Ullrich and Klöden. Vinokourov had failed badly, like Christophe Moreau, who had hoped to get the yellow jersey on this stage. Armstrong's attempt to win the stage on a sprint breakaway was foiled by Valverde in the closing meters. Nonetheless, the Texan regained the \"maillot jaune\" and seemed to acknowledge Valverde's win perhaps indicating that he saw him as future heir apparent.\n\n13 July 2005 — Courchevel to Briançon, \n\nStage 11 was another major mountain stage in the Alps including the legendary Col de la Madeleine and Col du Galibier climbs, the latter being the highest point of this year's tour at 2645m. Alexander Vinokourov, after a disastrous day in the previous stage to Courchevel when he lost over 5 minutes, attacked on the Col de la Madeleine. Lance Armstrong and his rode strongly behind mindful of the threat from Vinokourov but aware of the advantage that they had over him. The tactics of the T-Mobile team riders, including Vinokourov, in support of their apparent team leader Jan Ullrich were, as ever, questionable. Three riders, Óscar Pereiro (this year's most aggressive rider) and Santiago Botero (both of ) established a breakaway before Pereiro was dropped after the Col du Telegraphe and before the fearsome ascent of the Col du Galibier. Vinokourov crossed the summit of the Galibier first, taking the Henri Desgrange prize, in front of Botero, a rider who was enjoying a renaissance in 2005. Meanwhile, Lance Armstrong's Discovery Channel Team were controlling the peloton at just over 2 minutes behind although Michael Rasmussen jumped ahead to get more King of the Mountain points and to continue his domination of the polka dot jersey. Botero joined Vino on the now wet and dangerous descent and the pair continued together to Briancon where the Kazakhstan champion outsprinted Botero to take his second stage victory after his first one to Gap in the 2003 Tour de France that had seen the major injury to Joseba Beloki and the remarkable cross-country exploits of Lance Armstrong. The peloton, and all the main contenders, came in at 1'15\" behind thus preserving Armstrong in the yellow jersey and Vinokourov's exploits not making up for the previous day's losses.\n"}

The typeface was drawn as an extra-bold weight of Cooper's \"Cooper Old Style\" family. It rapidly became a standard typeface and was licensed by American Type Founders and also copied by many other manufacturers of printing systems.\n\nIts use in pop culture increased worldwide since 1966, when the Beach Boys used it for the cover artwork of their album \"Pet Sounds\". It was then featured in the Doors’ \"L.A. Woman\" (1971) and David Bowie’s \"Ziggy Stardust\" (1972), and in the opening credits of \"The Bob Newhart Show\", \"Garfield\", \"M*A*S*H\", \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\", and other shows. As a result, Cooper Black has become emblematic of late-'60s/early-'70s style.\n\nCooper Black followed on from Cooper's career as a lettering artist in Chicago and the Midwest of America in the 1920s. Cooper Black was advertised as being \"for far-sighted printers with near-sighted customers\", as well as \"the Black Menace\" by detractors. While very bold, Cooper Black is based on traditional \"old-style\" serif lettering, rather than the hard-edged \"fat face\" fonts popular in the nineteenth century, giving it a soft, 'muddy' appearance, with relatively low contrast between thick and thin strokes.\n\nCooper Hilite is a version of Cooper Black originally designed by painting white relief impressions into a printed proof of Cooper Black. It has been digitised by ParaType and Wordshape.\n\nCooper Black was immediately popular and spawned imitations, including Goudy Heavy Face from Frederic Goudy, Ludlow Black and Pabst Extra Bold. Cooper Black remains popular: the editors of the typography discussion website \"Fonts in Use\" report more submissions of its use than any other face that is not a sans-serif, although outnumbered by Times New Roman once its many variants are added up.\n\nMany unusual versions of Cooper were created in the phototypesetting period of the 1960s and 1970s, a period of explosion in production of display faces. These included \"Ziptop Cooper Black\" from Photo Lettering Inc., a version with the top bolder than the bottom, and other distorted variants.\n\nMany digitisations of Cooper Black exist from companies including Bitstream, Adobe and others. Soap, designed by Ray Larabie of Typodermic, is a uni-case variant. A version from URW, which does not include an italic, is bundled with many Microsoft products. Cooper Old Style has been digitised by URW.\n\n\n"}

In American service, the missile was called the MGM-21A. The missile entered service in 1955 with the French army. It was used briefly by the US army in the early 1960s. The missile ceased production in January 1962 after approximately 30,000 missiles had been built.\n\nDevelopment began in France in 1948, when the Arsenal de l'Aéronautique in Châtillon sous Bagneux began looking at the possibility of developing the German X-7 missile further. The missile was designed to be cheap: In 1955, the missile cost 340 Francs and the control box 1,750 Francs. The first rounds were test fired in 1952. Development was completed in 1955 and the missile entered service with the French Army under the designation SS.10 (\"Sol-Sol\" French for \"Surface to Surface\").\n\nThe US army procured 500 missiles and three sets of launching equipment to evaluate a prototype version of the missile between early 1952 and October 1953, but concluded that the missile was not currently ready for use, but that the continued development should be monitored. After development of the missile was completed, the US successfully re-evaluated the missile in mid-1958, and the later SS.11 (also by designer Bastien-Thiry) and Entac missiles were procured for Army use.\n\nIn late 1955, Israel ordered 36 SS.10 launchers. They were received a year later, too late for the IDF to use them in the 1956 Suez Crisis. Subsequently, a self-propelled variant was developed, with four launchers carried by Dodge truck. In the early 1960s, SS.10 missiles were retired from the IDF service, replaced by SS.11.\n\nThe US army was interested in the missile from an early stage, but pursued development of their own missile - the SSM-A-23 Dart missile. However, after the SSM-A-23 was cancelled in 1958, they began to consider procuring the SS.10 and SS.11 missiles. In February 1959, they decided to buy the SS.10 as a stopgap. The missile was delivered in January 1960 and was phased out in 1963 in favour of the MGM-32 Entac. The missile received the designation MGM-21A.\n\nIn flight, the missile is steered by an unusual arrangement of electrically powered vibrating spoilers, the power for these spoilers is transmitted to the missile along the guidance wires from the operator's station. Since the missile spins in flight, a gyroscope is needed to determine which spoilers are currently up/down or left/right. Guiding the missile to the target is very demanding and requires a high level of operator skill and concentration - this is typical with MCLOS guided missiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This is an old tradition, well illustrated in works such as Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Voltaire's \"Candide\". This practice arises in part from the desire of those subject to the power of those in authority to use an available means of limiting this power by demonstrating that the authority figure is just as subject to mockery as those lacking power. This represents \"the attempt to use aggression to protect oneself from engulfment, impingement or humiliation by diminishing the perceived power and threat of the other\", an effort which often takes the form of caricature of those in authority.\n\nThis theme was commonly used by British comedy troupe, Monty Python. In their sketches, a \"common comedic device was for authority figures (such as military officers, police, judges, Conservative politicians, BBC news announcers and even God) to take their characters to extremes by suddenly spouting complete nonsense\".\n\nExamples include: \n\nSome television shows, such as \"South Park\" and \"The Simpsons\", have a collection of characters that represent all of the main groups of authority figures, and each portray such figures as humorously flawed. Indeed, each show has a resident police officer — Officer Barbrady and Chief Wiggum, respectively — portrayed as an incompetent and bumbling idiot. The shows also mockingly portray their resident religious leader — Priest Maxi in \"South Park\" and Reverend Timothy Lovejoy in \"The Simpsons\". The shows also include, with slightly different characteristics, the flawed exercise of authority by parents, teachers, school principals, mayors, and occasionally of soldiers and politicians.\n\nExamples can also be found in the art of the Russian joke.\n"}

It is caused by a difference in air pressures inside and outside the cavities.\n\nTypically, sinus barotrauma is preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection or allergy. The affected person suffers a sudden sharp facial pain or headache during descent, which increases as the aircraft approaches ground level. The pain can ultimately become disabling unless the ambient pressure is reversed.\n\nThe pressure difference causes the mucosal lining of the sinuses to become swollen and submucosal bleeding follows with further difficulties ventilating the sinus, especially if the orifices are involved. Ultimately fluid or blood will fill the space.\n\nIn most cases of sinus barotrauma, localized pain to the frontal area is the predominant symptom. This is due to pain originating from the frontal sinus, it being above the brow bones. Less common is pain referred to the temporal, occipital, or retrobulbar region. Epistaxis or serosanguineous secretion from the nose may occur. Neurological symptoms may affect the adjacent fifth cranial nerve and especially the infraorbital nerve.\nThe pathology of sinus barotrauma is directly related to Boyle's law, which states that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure on it, when temperature is constant (P1 × V1 = P2 × V2). Two types of acute barotrauma are observed: squeeze and reverse squeeze.\n\nOn ascent, the air in the paranasal sinuses will expand according to Boyle's law, contracting during descent. Normally, the sinuses drain into the nasal cavity through small ostia, which permit mucociliary clearance and ventilation that equilibrates pressure. However, when the opening is obstructed due to inflammation, polyps, mucosal thickening, anatomical abnormalities, or other lesions, pressure equilibration is impossible. Squeeze is produced on descent when trapped air in the sinuses contracts and produces negative pressure. The pressure differentials are directed to the center of the sinuses producing mucosal edema, transudation, and mucosal-or submucosal-hematoma, leading to further occlusion of the sinus ostium. The sinus will fill with fluid or blood unless the pressure differential is neutralized.\n\nIf the outlet is blocked during ascent, the situation is reversed and \"reverse squeeze\" appears. Pressure inside the sinus increases, affecting the walls of the sinus and producing pain or epistaxis.\n\nThe majority of episodes of sinus barotrauma occur in the frontal sinuses with pain localized over the frontal area. Possible explanations for this might be the relatively long and delicate nasofrontal duct that connects the narrow frontal recess with the frontal sinuses.\n\nBarotrauma located in the maxillary, ethmoidal, or sphenoid sinuses is observed less frequently and appears when the ostia are blocked; the majority of cases are probably caused by an acute upper respiratory tract infection. The magnitude of the pressure difference needed to produce a barotrauma probably shows great individual variation and is related to the size of the sinus ostium and the rate of ambient pressure change. Due to this, even commercial flying may produce severe cases of barotraumas, although most of the cases are observed in high performance aircraft with lower pressurized cabins.\n\nMost cases occur in scuba divers and fliers, and is easily diagnosed when presented to physicians immediately after exposure. On the other hand, the problem may remain undiagnosed when the history fails to relate the symptoms to exposure to environmental pressure changes or if the focus is on other etiologies.\nWeissman defined three grades of sinus barotraumas according to symptomatology. \n\nMild cases of barotrauma are readily treated by topical decongestants and painkillers. In severe cases or cases resistant to local treatment, functional endoscopic sinus surgery is indicated in order to re-establish drainage and ventilation of the sinuses. This treatment has shown good results in aviators suffering from recurrent sinus barotrauma. Computer-aided surgery has re-established the drainage of affected sinuses, especially with regard to the sphenoid sinuses. When the sphenoids were entered endoscopically, mucosal petechia and hematoma were clearly seen.\nSinus barotrauma or aerosinusitis has been known since the early development of aviation medicine. However, it was during World War II that the subject first received serious attention and the pathogenesis of the disease was understood to be due to exposure to high altitude flights. Rapid altitude changes with accompanying changes in ambient pressure exposed the aircrews to an increasing number of episodes of sinus barotrauma.\n\nReferred pain from barosinusitis to the maxilla consists about one-fifth of in-flight barodontalgia (i.e., pain in the oral cavity caused by barometric pressure change) cases. Although the environment of fighter pilots produces the most stressful barometric changes, commercial flying has changed the picture of the disease.\n\n"}

This predicted that the rate of diffusion was linear with temperature and inversely linear with the strength of the confining magnetic field.\n\nThe rate predicted by Bohm diffusion is much higher than the rate predicted by classical diffusion, which develops from a random walk within the plasma. The classical model scaled inversely with the square of the magnetic field. If the classical model is correct, small increases in the field lead to much longer confinement times. If the Bohm model is correct, magnetically confined fusion would not be practical.\n\nEarly fusion energy machines appeared to behave according to Bohm's model, and by the 1960s there was a significant stagnation within the field. The introduction of the tokamak in 1968 was the first evidence that the Bohm model did not hold for all machines. Bohm predicts rates that are too fast for these machines, and classical too slow; studying these machines has led to the neoclassical diffusion concept.\n\nBohm diffusion is characterized by a diffusion coefficient equal to\n\nwhere \"B\" is the magnetic field strength, \"T\" is the electron gas temperature, \"e\" is the elementary charge, \"k\" is the Boltzmann constant. \n\nIt was first observed in 1949 by David Bohm, E. H. S. Burhop, and Harrie Massey while studying magnetic arcs for use in isotope separation. It has since been observed that many other plasmas follow this law. Fortunately there are exceptions where the diffusion rate is lower, otherwise there would be no hope of achieving practical fusion energy. In Bohm's original work he notes that the fraction 1/16 is not exact; in particular \"the exact value of [the diffusion coefficient] is uncertain within a factor of 2 or 3.\" Lyman Spitzer considered this fraction as a factor related to plasma instability.\n\nGenerally diffusion can be modeled as a random walk of steps of length formula_2 and time formula_3. If the diffusion is collisional, then formula_2 is the mean free path and formula_3 is the inverse of the collision frequency. The diffusion coefficient \"D\" can be expressed variously as\n\nwhere formula_7 is the velocity between collisions.\n\nIn a magnetized plasma, the collision frequency is usually small compared to the gyrofrequency, so that the step size is the gyroradius formula_8 and the step time is the collision time, formula_3, which is related to the collision frequency through formula_10, leading to formula_11. If the collision frequency is larger than the gyrofrequency, then the particles can be considered to move freely with the thermal velocity \"v\" between collisions, and the diffusion coefficient takes the form formula_12. Evidently the classical (collisional) diffusion is maximum when the collision frequency is equal to the gyrofrequency, in which case formula_13. Substitutingformula_14, and formula_15 (the cyclotron frequency), we arrive at\nwhich is the Bohm scaling. Considering the approximate nature of this derivation, the missing 1/16 in front is no cause for concern. Therefore, at least within a factor of order unity, Bohm diffusion is always greater than classical diffusion.\n\nIn the common low collisionality regime, classical diffusion scales with 1/\"B\"², compared with the 1/\"B\" dependence of Bohm diffusion. This distinction is often used to distinguish between the two.\n\nIn light of the calculation above, it is tempting to think of Bohm diffusion as classical diffusion with an anomalous collision rate that maximizes the transport, but the physical picture is different. Anomalous diffusion is the result of turbulence. Regions of higher or lower electric potential result in eddies because the plasma moves around them with the E-cross-B drift velocity equal to \"E\"/\"B\". These eddies play a similar role to the gyro-orbits in classical diffusion, except that the physics of the turbulence can be such that the decorrelation time is approximately equal to the turn-over time, resulting in Bohm scaling. Another way of looking at it is that the turbulent electric field is approximately equal to the potential perturbation divided by the scale length formula_2, and the potential perturbation can be expected to be a sizeable fraction of the \"k\"\"T\"/\"e\". The turbulent diffusion constant formula_18 is then independent of the scale length and is approximately equal to the Bohm value.\n\nThe theoretical understanding of plasma diffusion especially the Bohm diffusion remained elusive until the 1970s when Taylor and McNamara put forward a 2d guiding center plasma model. The concepts of negative temperature state, and of the convective cells contributed much to the understanding of the diffusion. The underlying physics may be explained as follows. The process can be a transport driven by the thermal fluctuations, corresponding to the lowest possible random electric fields. The low-frequency spectrum will cause the E×B drift. Due to the long range nature of Coulomb interaction, the wave coherence time is long enough to allow virtually free streaming of particles across the field lines. Thus, the transport would be the only mechanism to limit the run of its own course and to result in a self-correction by quenching the coherent transport through the diffusive damping. To quantify these statements, we may write down the diffusive damping time as\nwhere \"k\" is the wave number perpendicular to the magnetic field. Therefore, the step size is formula_20 , and the diffusion coefficient is\n\nIt clearly yields for the diffusion a scaling law of \"B\" for the two dimensional plasma. The thermal fluctuation is typically a small portion of the particle thermal energy. It is reduced by the plasma parameter\nand is given by\nwhere \"n\" is the plasma density, \"λ\" is the Debye length, and \"T\" is the plasma temperature. Taking formula_24 and substituting the electric field by the thermal energy, we would have\nThe 2D plasma model becomes invalid when the parallel decoherence is significant. A mechanism of Hsu diffusion proposed in 2013 by Hsu, Wu, Agarwal and Ryu. predicts a scaling law of \"B\".\n\nIn 2015, new exact explanation for the original Bohm's experiment is reported, in which the cross-field diffusion measured at Bohm's experiment and Simon's experiment were explained by the combination of the ion gyro-center shift and the short circuit effect. The ion gyro-center shift occurs when an ion collides with a neutral to exchange the momentum; typical example is ion-neutral charge exchange reaction. The one directional shifts of gyro-centers take place when ions are in the perpendicular (to the magnetic field) drift motion such as diamagnetic drift. The electron gyro-center shift is relatively small since the electron gyro-radius is much smaller than ion's so it can be disregarded. Once ions move across the magnetic field by the gyro-center shift, this movement generates spontaneous electric unbalance between in and out of the plasma. However this electric unbalance is immediately compensated by the electron flow through the parallel path and conducting end wall, when the plasma is contained in the cylindrical structure as in Bohm's and Simon's experiments. Simon recognized this electron flow and named it as ‘short circuit’ effect in 1955. With the help of short circuit effect the ion flow induced by the diamagnetic drift now becomes whole plasma flux which is proportional to the density gradient since the diamagnetic drift includes pressure gradient. The diamagnetic drift can be described as \n\nformula_26, (here \"n\" is density) for approximately constant temperature over the diffusion region. When the particle flux is proportional to formula_26, the other part than formula_28 is the diffusion coefficient. So naturally the diffusion is proportional to formula_29. The other front coefficient of this diffusion is a function of the ratio between the charge exchange reaction rate and the gyro frequency. A careful analysis tells this front coefficient for Bohm's experiment was in the range of 1/13 ~ 1/40. The gyro-center shift analysis also reported the turbulence induced diffusion coefficient which is responsible for the anomalous diffusion in many fusion devices; described as formula_30. This means different two diffusion mechanisms (the arc discharge diffusion such as Bohm's experiment and the turbulence induced diffusion such as in the tokamak) have been called by the same name of “Bohm diffusion”.\n\n"}

It was part of the National Rainbow Coalition that governed Kenya from 2003 to 2007, having ended forty years of Kenya African National Union rule. It is allied to the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy which is the main opposition coalition in Kenya's parliament and is headed by Athanus Wafula Wamunyinyi, the Member of Parliament for Kanduyi Constituency.\n\nThe history of FORD-Kenya is essentially the history of multi-party politics in Kenya. Kenya was a one-party state until December 1991, when a special conference of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) agreed to introduce a multiparty political system. An umbrella political grouping, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD), had been formed in August 1991 by six opposition leaders to fight for change in the country. But President Daniel arap Moi had outlawed it, and its leaders had been arrested and detained. They were released only after sustained pressure from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Scandinavian countries.\nIn August 1992, FORD split into two factions - FORD-Asili (led by Kenneth Matiba) and FORD-Kenya (led by Oginga Odinga). FORD-Kenya performed poorly in the general elections of 1992, coming a distant third behind KANU and FORD-Asili. The reelection of President Moi and KANU, both deeply unpopular, owed much to the division of the original FORD.\nOdinga died in January 1994 and was succeeded as chairman of FORD-Kenya by Michael Wamalwa Kijana. At the time, FORD-Kenya's leadership included some of the top opposition leaders in Kenya, including lawyer James Orengo, economist Professor Peter Anyang' Nyong'o, Raila Odinga (the son of Oginga Odinga), Oburu Odinga (Raila's elder brother), environmentalist, and, later on, Nobel laureate, Wangari Maathai, and many others. \nBut the party was headed for yet another split. Michael Wamalwa and Raila Odinga tussled over the leadership of FORD-Kenya for 2 years. In 1997, Wamalwa beat Odinga in free and fair party elections, precipitating a devastating tribal split that the party has yet to recover from. Raila, with a sizeable number of Luo MP's, left FORD-Kenya to join the National Development Party of Kenya (NDP). In the 1997 general elections, FORD-Kenya finished fourth, behind Raila's NDP.\n\nKenya's opposition political parties finally put their differences behind them in the run-up to the 2002 general elections, fielding one candidate, Mwai Kibaki, for the presidency. Kibaki defeated the KANU candidate, Uhuru Kenyatta, and formed a government of national unity. He appointed FORD-Kenya's leader, Michael Wamalwa, to be vice president and gave a number of cabinet positions to FORD-Kenya MPs.\n\nMichael Wamalwa Kijana died in London on 23 August 2003 after a long illness. After the funeral, FORD-Kenya elected Musikari Kombo to succeed Wamalwa, beating another FORD-Kenya MP, Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, in the contest.\nWith neither the charisma of Michael Wamalwa nor the crowd-pulling popularity of Raila Odinga, Kombo struggled to establish the party as an influential component of the ruling coalition. The party felt shortchanged after the death of Wamalwa, when the prized position of vice president was handed to the LDP's Moody Awori and a number of other appointments went the way of other parties. Kombo showed his mantle as the FORD-Kenya Chairman when he led his party MPs in rejecting their appointment to the newly reconstituted cabinet after the constitutional referendum of 2005. This forced President Mwai Kibaki to take Kombo and FORD-Kenya seriously and increase the number of FORD-Kenya cabinet ministers to 6 from 3 and acquire other senior civil service appointments for its party members.\nIn March 2007, a breakaway party known as New Ford Kenya was registered by cabinet minister Soita Shitanda. Kituyi later joined the party.\nAt the Kenyan general election, 2007, FORD-Kenya aligned with the newly created Party of National Unity led by President Kibaki. It ran, however, its own candidates in a number of constituencies and local authorities. The election results were very poor as with a quarter of constituencies not yet decided had FORD-Kenya holding only one seat. Kombo's tenure ended with the party suffering through numerous court cases trying to get a new leader. Eventually, Moses Wetangula became the leader of the party through a national delegates congress election.\n\nIn December 2012 it was one of four parties to enter into Coalition for Reforms and Democracy, alongside Raila Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement, Charity Ngilu's National Rainbow Coalition, and Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper Democratic Movement – Kenya.\n\nThe Article was Updated by Fanuel Kataka Amanya 0721730875\n"}

It was released as the lead single from the album on August 21, 2000 by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records. \"Music\" was inspired by a Sting concert Madonna attended and was written and produced by her with Mirwais Ahmadzaï. It is a disco, electro-funk and dance-pop song in a static key of G minor. Madonna's vocals are electronically manipulated in the track, with the lyrics having political and social undertones and reiterating the uniting power of music.\n\nBefore its official release, \"Music\" leaked onto the internet and was put up for listening in websites like Napster, which prompted Madonna's team to issue a statement threatening legal action. \"Music\" had different release formats with a number of remixes commissioned for the song. Music critics praised the track's production, catchiness and club-friendly nature, and compared it with Madonna's previous releases. It became a commercial success, peaking at number-one on the record charts of major markets, including Australia, Canada, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the latter, \"Music\" became Madonna's twelfth and final number-one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. It was also the longest running number-one song on the US Dance Club Songs chart, spending a total of five weeks at the top. \"Music\" has been included in many critic lists for Madonna's top singles and is often ranked as one of the best songs of the 2000s.\n\nIts accompanying music video, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, portrayed Madonna and her friends enjoying themselves, while traveling in a limousine driven by comedian Ali G. Academics noted the use of American imagery in the clip, especially Madonna's cowboy garb and her popularizing of cowboy fashion. In order to promote its parent album, Madonna performed \"Music\" at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards and at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards the following year, where it was nominated in the categories of Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Additionally, the song has been a regular staple in the set list of five of Madonna's concert tours, the last being the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016).\n\nAfter the critical and commercial success of her seventh studio album, \"Ray of Light\" (1998), Madonna intended to embark on a new concert tour in 1999, but due to the delay of her film, \"The Next Best Thing\", it was cancelled. By 2000, Madonna was dating director Guy Ritchie, and was pregnant with their child. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding the pregnancy, she concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, \"Music\". \"Ray of Light\"s success had made Madonna keen to go into a recording studio and she was introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï through photographer Stéphane Sednaoui.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Madonna recalled that her Maverick Records company partner Guy Oseary \"was given a demo by a French artist called Mirwais [Ahmadzaï]\". He wanted Madonna's opinion on whether Ahmadzaï could be signed to Maverick, as he was still largely unknown in the United States. Ahmadzaï had always preferred taking musical risks and hence he wanted the collaborations with Madonna to get out the best out of her. \"The challenge was to make something current appear, something hidden in her personality. Everybody knows [Madonna] as a chameleon, as a businesswoman. I wanted to show her potential as a musician,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the introspective mood on \"Ray of Light\", Madonna was ready to be energetic with the new album, and for the title track she wanted something that would make her \"feel like an animal, ready to sprung\". Madonna said that the inspiration behind \"Music\" came from a Sting concert that she had attended at New York City's Beacon Theater. There, the audience was well-behaved until Sting began playing old hits by his band, The Police. The lights were dimmed and everyone came closer to the stage to listen to Sting. \"Suddenly, people lost their inhibition and their politeness, and everyone was practically holding hands... I mean, it really moved me,\" she told \"Rolling Stone\"s Jancee Dunn. \"And I thought, 'That's what music does to people'\". This experience inspired Madonna to write the primary hook of the song, \"Music makes people come together / Music, makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel\".\n\nRecording sessions for \"Music\" began in September 1999 at Sarm West Studios in West London. An energetic Madonna wanted to make the title track a party song and a statement about love. Together with Ahmadzaï she started writing down the different parts of the song, picking up chords on guitar and lyrics. Following the completion of the song \"Paradise (Not For Me)\", they started experimenting with electro funk for \"Music\" and created the primary base of the track. \"It's not experimental\", Ahmadzaï recalled \"but its not completely easy. It was a small victory for underground music\". According to Madonna, writing and producing \"Music\" with Ahmadzaï set the tone of the rest of the parent album. But she faced communication problems with Ahmadzaï since he barely spoke English. \"The first couple of days we were recording, I wanted to rip my hair out,\" Madonna recalled. She asked his manager to step in as translator.\n\n\"Music\" begins with Madonna's androgynous voice uttering the line \"Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on, I wanna dance with my baby\". After that lyric, her electronically manipulated voice asks \"Do you like to boogie woogie?\". The producer used an EMS 2000 vocoder to twist the vocals and described to Ernie Rideout of \"Keyboard\" as an effect of going \"in fits and starts\". Mark \"Spike\" Stent recorded the song on a SSL 9000J console using a Sony 3348 HR and a BASF 931 tape. He mixed it at London's Olympic Studios using SSL G Series Quantegy magnetic tapes. Tim Young mastered the track at Metropolis Studio at Chiswick, London. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of \"Madonna: The Complete Guide to her Music\", the whole production has a dry sound with heavy usage of equalization which created contrast in the vocal, continuing till the first chorus. Guitar flicks can be heard with keyboard chords on the bridge. The music travels from right to left and vice versa when heard on a headphone. Musician Stuart Price, who worked the song for Madonna's 2001 Drowned World Tour, added that the rhythmic structure of \"Music\" was inspired from Kraftwerk's 1977 single, \"Trans-Europe Express\".\nHarmonically, \"Music\" has a time signature of common time, and its composition is based on a static key of G minor with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from G to two-lined note of D, with a basic sequence of Gm–F–Gm–F as its chord progression. According to the book \"Madonna's Drowned Worlds\", written by Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, \"Music\" is a \"disco anthem, and the beat commands [the people] to get up and dance\". The authors noted that the music was the central identification for the song, with its \"splashes of electronica and production tricks\" from reverse cymbal crescendo, and \"tightly quantized\" pitch and sounds from a Hammond organ. Madonna sung with her mouth close to the recording microphone, which Fouz-Hernández found gave the track a natural sound. Barry Walters from \"Billboard\" found the composition to also contain a blend of French electronica and 1970s electro funk, while Richard S. He of the same publication described the record as \"postmodern, escapist dance-pop\". The instrumental riff in the track is created by a 1970s analogue Moog synthesizer, which ultimately leads to the song fading out. The production in \"Music\" not only referenced disco and funk, but was also campy in nature as noted by Jarman-Ivens.\n\nLyrically the song reiterates the uniting power of music. The primary hook was deemed as having political implications, with Madonna renouncing the bourgeoisie. Fouz-Hernández believed that the line \"I wanna dance with my baby\" reinforced a connection with gay listeners because of its \"casual, campy style\". He compared the track to Madonna's first single, \"Everybody\" (1982), because in both songs she declares that music \"has the power to overcome divisions of race, gender, and sexuality\". It also recalled Madonna's early days of being carefree and living alone in New York, while being a staple in the city's night-club scene. According to \"Billboard\", Madonna's vocals \"binds a mind-blowing melange of hyperactive beats, grooves, and stinging percussive elements\" in the track. The magazine adds that the song is also \"saturated\" with the influence of Cameo, Herbie Hancock, Nitzer Ebb and Roger Troutman.\n\nOn June 2, 2000, an unauthorized incomplete demo of the song leaked onto the internet. Snippets of the tracks, ranging from 30 second to almost three minutes was circulated through fan websites and music download site, Napster. Madonna's spokeswoman Caresse Norman said that it was an unfinished version. Warner Bros. Records also issued another statement threatening legal actions against Napster lest the song was removed and added their expectation for \"the owners who have included this material on their site will comply immediately with our legitimate request that they cease permitting unauthorized downloads of this song.\" Madonna was disappointed, publishing a letter about the leak on \"Icon\", the magazine released quarterly for her official fanclub. The threatened lawsuit against the leak was reported in the media as Madonna being against Napster, which Madonna clarified was contrary and she \"found it a great way for listeners to access music\".\n\nWarner Bros. Records initially targeted the single to be released to radio in July 2000, but it was pushed back to August 1, with the commercial release for the CD single taking place on August 21. A new website called madonnamusic.com was created for the single's release with Madonna releasing a message to her fans: \"You've probably been hearing about my new record 'Music' for a while, but I just wanted to make sure that you know the single is going to drop very soon. I worked on this track with a French guy called Mirwais and he is the shit.\"\n\nThe B-side of the CD and cassette single featured the track \"Cyberraga\", a collaboration with Talvin Singh. The track was remixed by Groove Armada, Deep Dish, Victor Calderone, Hex Hector, and Tracy Young; all of them were handpicked by Madonna since it was \"more important to [her] that my records get played in the clubs. That's where I got my start, and that's where I will probably always feel most at home\". Contemporary club music was inspiration behind the remixes with Calderone adding tribal beats and synths around Madonna's vocals. A house beat and bassline was used in Deep Dish's remix, while Hector utilized electro-skewed beats, guitar licks and breakbeat. Young's 13 minute remix used ambient interludes, house music rhythms, trance and 1970s music with Madonna's singing sounding fresh. Club DJs received the promotional remixes on August 2, 8 and 15, while they were released to retailers on August 22 in maxi-CD and double vinyl formats.\n\nUpon release, the song received generally positive reviews from critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of \"\", declared \"Music\" as a dance-anthem \"that reaches into the future but also slyly conjures images and feelings of the good ol' disco days\". In a similar review, Lucy O'Brien, author of \"\", relegated the track as \"a resurrection of the disco girl\" image. She listed \"Music\" as a career-defining moment for Madonna, like previous singles \"Vogue\" and \"Justify My Love\" (both released in 1990). O'Brien clarified the song as \"the same genre defining quality, robotic, tinny, trashy and audacious... She resurrects the Madonna imperative. Dance. Party. Surrender\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it \"a thumping track which sounds funkier, denser, sexier with each spin\". Jim Farber of the \"New York Daily News\" gave a positive feedback, stating that it is \"everything a single should be: pithy, simple and maddeningly catchy, her most instantly embraceable single since 'Holiday'\". Farber also highlighted the lyrics, which he felt covered familiar ground for Madonna by talking about the power of dance music. This thought was shared by Fouz-Hernández, who believed that like her debut single \"Everybody\", \"Music\" defined Madonna's artistic credibility.\n\nReviewing the parent album for \"Rolling Stone\", Barry Walters also compared it to Madonna's earlier work. Sal Cinquemani from \"Slant Magazine\" called it Madonna's best dance track since \"Vogue\", also comparing it to her 1985 single, \"Into the Groove\". In his review of Madonna's 2001 compilation \"GHV2\", Cinquemani praised the single's \"retro club beats and vintage synth sound\". Giving it a B rating, he concluded that \"only a former material girl living in a NASDAQ world could get away with a song like this\". Dimitri Ehrlich from \"Vibe\" found \"Music\" to be \"a bouncing parade of synthesizers that pose the question 'Do fortysomething baby-mamas still have the divine right to get down?' (The answer is yes)\". Chuck Arnold from \"Entertainment Weekly\", called it one of Madonna's \"most eccentric hits ever\" and found it to be reminiscent of her earlier works, specifically \"Holiday\".\n\n\"Billboard\"s Chuck Taylor praised the song as a \"stunning enterprise, a ballsy testament to [Madonna's] insistence on being a style-setter and one of the industry's most savvy—and now critically accountable—tunesmiths\". He believed that both radio and the audience would be shocked with the experimentation Madonna achieved in the track. Larry Flick from the same publication described the song as \"anthemic\", also predicting a positive commercial reception. Ethan Brown, from \"New York\" magazine, stated that the song \"elicits memories of past pop odes to dance culture\", and praised its \"giddy mix of electro-bounce, campy vocoder chants, and funky keyboard squeals\". Charlotte Robisnon of \"PopMatters\" believed that \"Music\"'s appeal lay in the \"freewheeling, fun spirit\" nature of Madonna, which had initially made her popular. However, she also called it a \"goofy Rick James rip-off\". For Medium's Richard LaBeau, \"this bold and aggressive electro-funk song may not be particularly lyrically inspired but it is rightfully hailed as one of her finest and most unexpected hours\".\n\nNegative criticism came from \"The Guardian\"s Garry Mulholland, who described the track as \"the sound of a bunch of middle-aged trend-watchers second-guessing what today's kids go for [...] the absolute definition of mutton-dressed-as-lamb middle-youth\". Alex Pappademas from \"Spin\", pointed out that \"its dancefloor liberation mantra feels forced\". Danny Eccleston from \"Q\" described the song as \"daring gambit\" and found that the track did not resemble any Madonna endeavor. He panned the over-usage of the electronic sounds and compared \"Music\" unfavorably to Daft Punk's \"Around the World\" (1997).\n\nPrior to the official release of the song, it started receiving airplay in US radios due to public demand, as noted by Paul Bryant, program director at WHTZ (Z100) station in New York. There was equal anticipation regarding retail sales of the track. On August 12, 2000, \"Music\" entered at number 41 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming the second-highest debuting single based solely on radio play. Fred Bronson from \"Billboard\" noted that it was Madonna's highest-debuting single on the Hot 100 since \"The Power of Good-Bye\" entered at number 24 in October 1998. The song debuted at number 38 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart, garnering an audience of 38 million. \"Music\" continued ascending up the Hot 100 and following the commercial release, it jumped from number 14 to number two on the chart dated September 9, 2000. The CD maxi and 12-inch vinyls sold a combined 62,500 copies, leading it to debut at number three on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. Silvio Pietroluongo from \"Billboard\" observed that only Madonna's \"This Used to Be My Playground\" single had debuted with more sales, 76,000 copies in August 1992.\n\nThe next week, \"Music\" sold a further 156,234 units and topped the Hot 100, replacing Janet Jackson's \"Doesn't Really Matter\". It was Madonna's 12th song to reach the summit, her first number-one single since \"Take a Bow\" in February 1995 and her most recent number one on the chart to this day. She tied the Supremes and moved to fifth rank among artists with most Hot 100 number-ones. The song amassed the highest weekly sales total and the highest points (23,110) for a song topping the chart. \"Music\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipment of over a million copies, and as of August 2009 had sold 1.136 million in physical CD sales, and an additional 217,000 in digital download. \"Music\" placed at number 17 on the \"Billboard\" Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2000. Aided by the official remixes, the song also reached number-one on the Dance Club Songs chart, remaining atop for five weeks. It was the top ranking Dance Club song of 2000 and the second most-successful Dance Club song of the 2000s decade in the United States, behind Madonna's own \"Hung Up\" (2005). In Canada, the song debuted at number 23 on the \"RPM\" Singles Chart and reached the top after five weeks. It was present on top of the charts for a total of nine weeks and was the final song to remain atop the chart when \"RPM\" ceased publication in November 2000.\n\n\"Music\" was also a success in Australia and New Zealand. The song debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart, where it stayed for three consecutive weeks. It was the fourth best-selling single in the country and was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 140,000 copies. In New Zealand, \"Music\" debuted at number 33 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, and ascended to the top ten, finally peaking at number one on the week of October 1, 2000.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Music\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number one. It faced tough competition with Spiller's \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" and beat the latter by 1,000 sales. Madonna became the first solo female artist to collect ten number-one singles. The song was present on the chart for 24 weeks, and was the 24th best selling release of 2000 in the country. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it gold in July 2013, and according to the Official Charts Company, \"Music\" is Madonna's 14th best-selling single and sold 415,000 copies in the region as of February 2014. Making its debut at its peak position of number 8, \"Music\" charted for a total of 20 weeks in France, before falling out on January 6, 2001. On August 31, 2000, \"Music\" debuted at number two on the Swedish Singles Chart. Similarly in Switzerland, the song debuted at number one, and spent 21 weeks in the chart. The single's performancein the UK and Europe enabled it to debut atop the European Hot 100 Singles chart, with greatest gaining points on the radio and dance charts. It was present in the position for six weeks\n\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who had previously helmed Madonna's \"Ray of Light\" clip in 1998. It stars Madonna, her longtime backup singer Niki Haris and her personal friend, actress Debi Mazar, as well as comedian Sacha Baron Cohen as his famous character Ali G. Madonna became a fan of the comedian after watching his Christmas special, \"Ali G, Innit\" (1999). When the video was planned Madonna thought that Baron Cohen \"would be great in it\", although it was confirmed that he was not going to be involved in the musical aspects. Åkerlund stated that originally they intended to have American comedian Chris Rock in the video. But since Baron Cohen was not known in the US at that time, the director showed everyone clips from \"Da Ali G Show\" so they could see the Ali G character.\n\nWhen we did the 'Music' video, it was a weird time. [Madonna] was pregnant and we didn't want her to look pregnant—so we had to work around that. We had an idea to do a fun party video with her and her girls, make it a little bling and cowboy hats and all that. We wanted to have some comedy in there and I wanted to do some animation.\n\nThe video was shot in Los Angeles, California in April 2000, to accommodate Madonna's pregnancy and her then-growing waistline. Crewmember were asked to sign confidentiality documents for the filming. Madonna conceptualized the clip, wanting to show her take on the stereotypical R&B and rap music videos. She wanted to do role reversals with females enacting characters generally reserved for males. However, her range was limited being pregnant so she \"had to think of a concept that would incorporate me being almost a voyeur rather than the central force in the video. So I figured if I played this kind of mack-daddy/pimp character, where things just came to me, happened to me and happened around me while I was watching it all happen, I could kill two birds with one stone.\"\n\nMadonna's look in the clip was described by O'Brien as a \"ghetto-fabulous female in a feather boa and stetson; all diamonds and bling, going to lapdancing bars and travelling in the back of a luxury limousine\". She had initially enlisted some actors to portray her accompaniments in the video, but she did not feel comfortable with their stiffness, their model-like appearance and lack of personality. So she called up Mazar and Harris to come and star in the video. \"I was at home when Madonna called me. She said 'I need my girlfriend, not these fake girl-friends trying to be my girlfriends. Throw on some clothes and come down'\", recalled Harris. Ali G kept entertaining everyone in the set with Madonna not being able to \"keep a straight face\" during her takes. She kept her coat shut all the time and had to sit in the limousine to hide her belly.\n\nThe music video debuted on MTV and VH1 on August 22, 2000. VH1 channel aired a special hour-long program, \"Madonna's Music\", in which Madonna called in for a phone interview. It was hosted by VH1's Rebecca Rankin who presided a discussion with \"Rolling Stone\" music critic Joe Levy about Madonna and her looks, as well as a video interview with Mazar and Harris. VH1 also aired a countdown of Madonna's previous videos and offered its viewers to listen to a remix of \"Music\".\n\nThe clip starts with Madonna and her friends getting into a limousine, driven by Ali G. As the music starts Ali G is directed to take them to a club where Madonna and her friends dance and drink. He later takes them to a strip-club, where Madonna goes inside but he is denied entrance. An animated section follows where Madonna, as a superhero character with superpowers, flies above rooftops, swims underwater, and works as a DJ at a club with a dozen arms like a Hindu deity. Madonna's animated character also attacks various neon signs displaying the names of her previous singles. The video ends with Madonna and her friends traveling in the limousine packed with the strippers and Ali G engaging in a rendezvous with them. According to author Georges Claude Guilbert, throughout the clip Madonna wears a gold necklace around her neck that says \"Mommy\", a reference to her apparent pregnancy. In the extended version of the music video, there is a variation at the end of the animated section. Ali G briefly interrupts the song to demonstrate his rap skills to persuade Madonna to include him on her next single. An annoyed Madonna asks him to stop and to turn the song back on.\n\nJarman-Ivens noted the use of American imagery in the clip, especially Madonna's cowboy garb and her popularizing of cowboy fashion. She found it interesting that Madonna \"turned\" to Americana, \"underlining her interest in exploring her relationship to mainstream America through a fashion and cultural style that is rich and multi-layered in its meaning\". The author also emphasized Madonna's sexual assertiveness in the music video, and emphatic defining of herself as \"a sexual free spirit\", as well as portrayal of expensive accouterments. \"Music\" was released as a DVD single on September 5, 2000. It reached the top of the UK Music Video charts and number three on the US Music Video charts, receiving gold certification in both regions. The clip was parodied on the sixth season of \"Mad TV\" and was called \"Movies\". It featured Mo Collins as Madonna and poked fun at Madonna's filmography, with an animated version of Madonna attacking signs displaying her commercially flop films. In 2009, the video was included on Madonna's compilation, \"\".\n\n\"Music\" earned two nominations at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards, in the categories of Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It also won the ASCAP Awards in the categories of Most Performed Pop Songs and Top Dance Songs. The video won several awards, including \"Best Pop Clip of the Year\" at the 2000 \"Billboard\" Music Video Awards and \"Best Dance Video\" at the International Dance Music Awards in 2000. At the Danish Music Awards it won the trophy of Best International Hit. The 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards nominated the track in the category of Best Song. \"Music\" also received a nomination at the 2001 TEC Awards, for its record production, and International Song of the Year at the 2001 NRJ Music Award.\n\"Music\" has been included in many critic lists for Madonna's top singles and is often ranked as one of the best songs of the 2000s. \"Dotmusic\" placed it within its top-ten singles for 2000. In 2003, \"Q Magazine\" ranked the song at number 778 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\". \"Rolling Stone\" listed \"Music\" as the 66th best of the 2000s decade, commenting that \"despite all the new pop starlets out there trying to jump her train, Madonna definitely [is] not slackening pace. When she dropped \"Music\". she was older than Britney and Christina combined, yet she took them to school with vintage electro-boom, Eurodisco flourishes from French producer Mirwais, and her own inimitable sass.\" The publication also ranked it at number nine on their list of Madonna's 50 Greatest Songs, writing that \"After years spent making albums that bridged boundaries of race, gender and sexual orientation, Madonna finally wrote a tune explicitly devoted to the democratizing power of music itself.\" \"The Huffington Post\"s Matthew Jacobs ranked it at number 11 on his list \"The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles\". Jacobs believed that the phrase \"Hey Mr. DJ\" gave rise to the usage of name-checking in songs thereafter, employed by other artists like Jennifer Lopez, Black Eyed Peas and Mariah Carey.\n\nIn 2011, VH1 created a countdown of the top songs of 2000 decade and placed Music\" at number 28. \"Entertainment Weekly\" likewise ranked \"Music\" at number seven on their list of Madonna's 35 top singles, saying that the \"message [in the song] is universal\". Michael Roffman from Consequence of Sound listed the track at number 15, feeling that the commercial reception to the release of \"Music\" was \"almost meta come to think of it; the song \"did\" make people come together\". Enio Chola of \"PopMatters\" placed \"Music\" at number five in his list of The Top 15 Madonna Singles of All Time, feeling that \"After the confessional \"Ray of Light\", Madonna was ready to dance again, and like no one else can, she proved that her ability to write pure unadulterated mega pop hits was still in full form as she began the third decade of her music career.\" \"LA Weekly\"s Michael Cooper ranked the track at number 12 in his list of Madonna's Top 20 Singles. He opined that Ahmadzaï's production of the track \"[helped] to cement Madonna as the queen of reinvention\". Ed Masley of \"The Arizona Republic\" placed it at number 13 on his Essential Madonna playlist. Writing for \"The Guardian\", Jude Rogers listed \"Music\" at number 10 on her ranking of Madonna's singles, in honor of her 60th birthday. Similarly, \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed it as her seventh best single.\n\nThe first live performance of \"Music\" took place during the promotional concerts for the album, held on November 5, 2000, at New York City's Roseland Ballroom, and on November 29 at London's Brixton Academy. During the New York performance, she wore a black tank top with \"Britney Spears\" written on it, along with cowboy hats and boots. For the London performance, Madonna wore a different T-shirt, with the names of her son Rocco and daughter Lourdes printed on it. On November 16, 2000 Madonna performed \"Music\" during the MTV Europe Music Awards 2000. She was introduced by Ali G as \"Maradona\" and wore a tank top with \"Kylie Minogue\" printed on it. A day later, she later performed \"Music\" and \"Don't Tell Me\" on British television program \"Top of The Pops\" and one week later on French television program \"Nulle Part Ailleurs\".\n\nOn February 21, 2001, Madonna opened the 43rd Grammy Awards with a performance of the track. The stage had five giant video screens, which showed clippings from her career. Madonna entered the stage in a Cadillac driven by rapper Bow Wow. She emerged dressed in a full-length fur coat, which she removed to reveal a tight leather jacket and jeans. She took off the jacket to reveal a black tank top with the words \"Material Girl\" and performed the song, joined by backup singers Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. For the Drowned World Tour in the same year, \"Music\" was used as the final encore. Madonna wore tight black jeans and a customized Dolce & Gabbana halter top that proclaimed \"Mother\" in the front and \"F*cker\" in the back. She sang the song surrounded by her dancers, while images from her past music videos were displayed on the backdrops. In his review, \"NME\"s Alex Needham commented that the performance \"underlines how easily [Madonna] could have brought the audience to collective orgasm by simply reeling out her classics\". The performance on August 26, 2001, at The Palace of Auburn Hills was recorded and released in the live video album, \"Drowned World Tour 2001\".\n\n\"Music\" was later added to the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004. Set to a slower, hip-hop inspired remix, the performance featured Madonna and her dancers wearing Scottish kilts and a lighted staircase surrounding a DJ Station. At the end, Madonna and her dancers lifted up their kilts to spell the word \"FREEDOM\", with glitter letters on their underpants. MTV's Corey Moss opined that during the performance \"Madonna and her dancers transformed the arena into a steamy nightclub\". The next year, Madonna performed \"Music\" at the Live 8 benefit concert in London. On the 2006 Confessions Tour, Madonna performed \"Music Inferno\", a mashup of \"Music\" and The Trammps's \"Disco Inferno\". It began with several dancers on roller skates emerging from beneath the stage to perform \"\"Xanadu\"-worthy tricks\", while the stage was bathed in deep red lights. Madonna appeared wearing a white suit and performed the track; the performance also included a sample from her song \"Where's The Party\", from her third studio album \"True Blue\" (1986), at the beginning. Halfway through the performance, Madonna walked to the center stage where, according to MTV's Corey Moss, she did \"her best \"Saturday Night Fever\"-era John Travolta routine, complete with the 'hitchhike' (you know, thumbs to the side)\". The performance of the song at the August 15–16, 2006 shows in London, at the Wembley Arena, were recorded and included on Madonna's second live album, \"The Confessions Tour\" (2007).\n\"Music\" was the closing song on the Hard Candy Promo Tour. Madonna wore a skintight black suit and a lace top, and began the performance by singing the song at the very front of the stage a cappella, before all her dancers joined. It ended with Madonna racing up the stage to the subway doors, behind which she disappeared. It was also included as the last song of the \"Old School\" segment of her Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–09), where Madonna performed the same version as the promotional tour, but sampling Indeep's \"Last Night A DJ Saved My Life\" at the beginning as well as mashing it up with Fedde le Grand's \"Put Your Hands Up 4 Detroit\"; the backdrop screens depicting a graffiti-splattered New York City Subway train. Madonna's outfit, a pair of gym shorts with long socks and sneakers, was a reference to her old days in New York. The performance of the song at River Plate Stadium of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was recorded and released on the live CD-DVD album, \"Sticky & Sweet Tour\" (2010).\n\nIn 2012, Madonna included the song on her Super Bowl XLVI halftime show set list, where it was remixed with LMFAO's \"Party Rock Anthem\" and \"Sexy and I Know It\". The same year, she performed it on The MDNA Tour at New York City's Madison Square Garden, on November 14. She invited South Korean rapper Psy and performed together his song \"Gangnam Style\" and her 2008 single, \"Give It 2 Me\". \"Music\" opened the final section of the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016), with Madonna decked in a \"Harlem-flapper-meets-Paris-in-the-Twenties\" dress, adorned with thousands of Swarovski crystals. The song \"began as a Jazz Age ballad before kicking into banger mode\". Madonna's dancers were dressed in Golden Twenties inspired costumes with one of them topless. Joe Lynch from \"Billboard\", opined that \"the presence of 'Music' was an effective reminder that while some compulsive naysayers \"tsk\" the Queen of Pop for trend chasing with Diplo, she brought techno to the pop mainstream years before EDM was an ubiquitous term\". The performance of the song at the March 19–20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in the live album, \"Rebel Heart Tour\". On December 6, 2016, Madonna performed \"Music\" during the Carpool Karaoke segment of \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\".\n\nIn 2004, Canadian tech-metal band Out of Your Mouth released a cover version of \"Music\" as their debut single. Vocalist Jason Darr commented, \"I absolutely love her, I've bought her records and when she came out with that song it was like I was hit over the head with it\". In 2007, The Dynamics recorded and released an eight-minute reggae cover on their album \"Versions Excursions\". David Dacks from \"Exclaim!\" was satisfied with the recording, saying that it \"fares well too, with the lyrics adapting well to a reggae context\". French metal band Eths added a cover of the song as a bonus track on their third studio album \"III\" (2012). In addition, remixed eurodance cover versions of the song have appeared on the \"Dancemania\" series albums, including an uptempo cover remix by Nancy and the Boys on the 2001 album \"Dancemania Speed 6\".\n\n\"Music\" was featured during the ninth season of American reality competition series, \"RuPaul's Drag Race\". It was used as the lip-sync song for the sixth episode, between contestants Peppermint and Cynthia Lee Fontaine, with the former winning the round. The runway that week was themed around Madonna's iconic looks. Madonna herself referenced \"Music\" in her 13th studio album, \"Rebel Heart\" (2015), in the track \"Veni Vidi Vici\" by singing the line: \"I saw a Ray of Light / Music saved my life\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of the CD single and \"Music\".\n\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Physical\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Digital\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Video\n\n"}

{"id": "2231739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231739", "title": "Leighfield", "text": "Leighfield\n\nLeighfield is a civil parish in the county of Rutland in the East Midlands of England. There is no settlement centre in the parish, only a few isolated properties. In the 2001 census it had a population of 10, which was the fourth smallest of Rutland's parish populations. At the 2011 census the population remained less than 100 and was included in the civil parish of Ridlington. It shares its name with Leighfield Forest, a much larger area from Braunston-in-Rutland to Stockerston and from Skeffington to Ridlington, a triangle of land roughly in each direction.\n\nThe Leighfield Way is a waymarked route joining the Leicestershire and Rutland Rounds at Belton-in-Rutland with the Hereward Way and Viking Way at Oakham.\n\nIn the early medieval period, Leighfield Forest was an extensive Royal forest straddling the borders of Rutland and Leicestershire. It included large numbers of sizeable wooded areas, which would mostly have been individually enclosed. The Forest also included roads, villages and farmland so was not ideal for Forest administration. It had been created soon after Henry I became king in 1100 and it was initially known as the Forest of Rutland (although a significant portion was in Leicestershire). Sauvey Castle, near Withcote, was probably built by King John in 1211 as a secluded hunting lodge. In 1235 all the Leicestershire sections were released from Forest Law, and in 1299 an eastern section was similarly disafforested.\n\nAbuses by the Royal Officers would seem to have been at least as big a problem as poaching by the lower orders. One forester was found to be keeping 300 pigs in the woods. In 1269 the forester Peter de Neville was arraigned by the king's justices for taking for his own use timber, firewood and charcoal to the amount of 7,000 oaks and other trees. At least four deer parks were enclosed within the Forest, at Lyddington, Ridlington, Flitteriss Park and Cold Overton Park. Of these only Cold Overton still has ancient woodland. By the late 16th century, the Hastings family of Ashby de la Zouch were the Forest Wardens. It was by then known as Leighfield Forest, and was administered as three bailiwicks: Braunston, Ridlington and Beaumont. 33 individual woods are named in an inquisition of 1566, totalling 1060 acres.\n\nThe end of the Forest came about in 1630 when Charles I removed the royal protection, and sold off his lands. It was rapidly given over to agriculture, whether pasture or tillage, and by 1700 nearly all the woodland has been cleared. The surviving ancient woodlands in the area include Prior's Coppice, Bolt Wood, Owston Woods, Skeffington Woods (listed as Leighfield Forest SSSI), Great Merrible Wood, the Launde woods, Wardley Wood and Stoke Dry Wood. The greater part of the former Forest, including Leighfield parish, is now an open landscape, although with species-rich hedgerows. Removal of many hedgerows during the 20th century has made the Leighfield woodlands increasingly isolated, but the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust's 'Living Landscape' project has targeted Leighfield as one of its landscape-scale projects, and is working with the Forestry Commission to create new woodlands that can act as links between the ancient sites.\n\nSeveral fragments have been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest as Leighfield Forest SSSI.\n"}

After graduation, he attended Miami-Dade Community College, and was a baseball letterman and an All-Conference selection.\n\nIbañez was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the 36th round of the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Ibañez played as a catcher and outfielder at various levels in the Mariners minor league organization. He began his professional career with the rookie-level AZL Mariners in 1992. Ibañez batted .308 with 37 hits, 8 doubles, 2 triples, 1 home run, and 16 RBIs in 33 games that season. The next season, 1993, Ibañez split the season between the Class-A Short-Season Bellingham Mariners, and the Class-A Appleton Foxes. He batted a combined .278 with 81 hits, 14 doubles, 2 triples, 5 home runs, and 36 RBIs in 95 games. Ibañez played for the Class-A Appleton Foxes again in 1994, and batted .312 with 102 hits, 30 doubles, 3 triples, 7 home runs, 59 RBIs, and 10 stolen bases in 91 games. That season, Ibañez led the team in RBIs, and doubles.\nIn 1995, Ibañez was promoted to the Class-A Advanced Riverside Pilots of the California League. He batted .332 with 120 hits, 23 doubles, 9 triples, 20 home runs, and 108 RBIs in 95 games. Ibañez was second in the league in RBIs, and was tied for seventh in the league in home runs. Ibañez played for two minor league teams in 1996. He started the season with the Double-A Port City Roosters where he batted .368 with 28 hits, 8 doubles, 1 triple, 1 home run, and 13 RBIs in 19 games. He was later promoted to the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers where he batted .284 with 115 hits, 20 doubles, 3 triples, 11 home runs, and 47 RBIs in 111 games.\n\nOn August 1, 1996, after being called up from the minor leagues, Ibañez made his first major league appearance against the Milwaukee Brewers. That season, Ibañez appeared in four games and went hitless. In 1997, Ibañez began the season in the minor leagues with the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers. He batted .304 with 133 hits, 30 doubles, 3 triples, 15 home runs, 82 RBIs in 111 games. On August 10, Ibañez made his first appearance of the season in the majors against the Chicago White Sox.

On September 27, Ibañez hit his first major league home run against the Oakland Athletics' pitcher Mike Oquist. After 11 games in the majors, Ibañez batted .154 with 4 hits, 1 triple, 1 home run, and 4 RBIs.\n\nIbañez started the 1998 season with the Triple-A Rainiers and batted .216 with 41 hits, 8 doubles, 1 triple, 6 home runs, and 25 RBIs in 52 games. Ibañez was called up in August to the majors and batted .255 with 25 hits, 7 doubles, 1 triple, 2 home runs, and 12 RBIs in 37 games.\n\nIbañez played the majority of the 1999 season with the Mariners, however, he did spend 8 games with the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers and batted .335 with 11 hits. In 1999 with the Mariners, Ibañez batted .254 with 54 hits, 7 doubles, 9 home runs, and 27 RBIs in 87 games. Ibañez hit the first grand slam home run in Safeco Field history, at the park's third-ever game.\n\nIn 2000, Ibañez again split the season between the Mariners and the Triple-A Rainiers. With the Rainiers, Ibañez batted .250 with 10 hits, 4 doubles, and 6 home runs in 10 games. Ibañez appeared in 92 regular season games with the Mariners in 2000. He batted .229 with 32 hits, 8 doubles, 2 home runs, and 15 RBIs. Ibañez appeared in three games in the 2000 American League Division Series and in 8 at-bats got 3 hits. During the next round of the playoffs, the 2000 American League Championship Series, Ibañez appeared in six games and went hitless. He became a free agent after the season.\n\nIbañez was signed by the Kansas City Royals as a free agent before the season. In 2001 with the Royals, Ibañez batted .280 with 78 hits, 11 doubles, 5 triples, 13 home runs, and 54 RBIs in 104 games. He also played with the Triple-A Omaha Royals for 8 games and batted .148 with 4 hits. The next season, 2002, Ibañez played the entire season in the majors for the first time in his career. On June 9, Ibañez hit a walk-off home run against St. Louis Cardinals' pitcher Mike Timlin to give the Royals a three-to-two win. On June 26, Ibañez hit a double, triple, and a home run in the same game against the Detroit Tigers. About the opportunity to play everyday, Ibañez said this:\n\nAt the end of 2002, Ibañez batted .294 with 146 hits, 37 doubles, 6 triples, 24 home runs, and 103 RBIs in 137 games. His 6 triples stood as his career high. Ibañez was second on the team in doubles, and RBIs; and was tied for second in triples, and home runs. Ibañez received the Joe Burke Special Achievement Award as voted upon by the Kansas City, Missouri chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.\n\nBefore the start of the 2003 season, Ibañez filed for salary arbitration. The Royals avoided arbitration hearings with Ibañez after he accepted their one-year $3 million contract offer. In 157 games with the Royals, Ibañez batted .294 with 179 hits, 33 doubles, 5 triples, 18 home runs, and 90 RBIs.\n\nAfter three seasons with the Royals, Ibañez returned to Seattle in and had a career-high .304 batting average. He also collected a 24-game go-ahead RBI string, matched a club record by reaching base 11 consecutive times, set a career-high and a club record and matched the American League record with six hits, and joined Ichiro Suzuki as only Mariners ever with two five-hit games in one season. He also ranked third among qualifying big league left fielders in UZR, an all-inclusive fielding statistic.\n\nWith Edgar Martínez retired, Ibañez moved to the DH spot before the season. In 2005, Ibañez hit .280 with 20 home runs and 89 RBIs. The Mariners acquired the switch hitting designated hitter Carl Everett from the Chicago White Sox during the 2005 offseason, forcing Ibañez to move back to where he played before, namely left field. Ibañez enjoyed his most productive season with the Mariners in , when he collected career-highs in home runs (33), RBIs (123), doubles (33) and triples (5), and hit .289 with 103 runs.\n\nIn , the Mariners acquired José Vidro to assume the role of DH. Ibañez moved back out to left field and posted a .291 batting average with 21 home runs, 105 RBI, 80 runs and 35 doubles in 149 games. Ibañez hit 12 home runs and 55 RBIs with a .321 batting average in the second half of the 2008 season. He finished the season with a .293 batting average, 23 home runs, 110 RBI, 85 runs and a career-high 43 doubles by playing 162 games that year.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, Ibañez signed a 3-year, $31.5 million deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. On April 9, 2009, Ibañez hit his first home run as a member of the Phillies, a deep, two-run shot to right field at Citizens Bank Park. Ten days later, on April 19, he hit a 2-run, walk-off home run to help the Phillies defeat the San Diego Padres. He hit his eighth career grand slam on April 27 as part of an eighth-inning comeback to help defeat the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park.\n\nIn voting for the 2009 All Star Game, Ibañez received the second-most votes for a NL outfielder with 4,053,355, trailing only the Brewers' Ryan Braun (4,138,559). In the World Series, he batted .304 with four doubles, a home run and four RBI. In 134 regular season games, the 37-year-old Ibañez hit .272 with 32 doubles, 93 runs and 93 RBI. He posted career-highs in home runs (34), slugging percentage (.552), and OPS (.899). He had a .991 fielding percentage with two errors in 129 games in left field. He also ranked fourth among qualifying big league left fielders in UZR.\nIbanez was the left fielder in Roy Halladay's perfect game on May 29, 2010.\nDuring the 2010 season, Ibañez played in 155 games with a .275 average, 37 doubles, 16 home runs, and 83 RBI. In 2011, on defense he had the lowest range factor of all major league left fielders, at 1.60. He played 144 games with a .245 average, 31 doubles, 20 home runs, and 84 RBI.\n\nOn February 20, 2012, Ibañez agreed to a contract worth $1.1 million with the New York Yankees. The deal was made official one day later. Ibañez struggled during spring training. When Brett Gardner suffered an injury in April, Ibañez saw increased playing time in left field against right-handed pitchers.\n\nOn September 22, Ibañez hit a game-tying home run in the 13th inning of a game against the Oakland Athletics. In the second to last game of the regular season, Ibañez hit a pinch hit home run in the ninth inning and a game-winning RBI single in the 12th inning to keep the Yankees one game ahead of the Baltimore Orioles in the division. During the regular season, Ibañez appeared in 130 games, hitting .240 with 19 home runs and 62 RBI.\n\nIn Game 3 of the 2012 American League Division Series against the Orioles, Ibañez pinch hit for Alex Rodriguez and hit home runs in consecutive at bats. He hit the first home run off of Jim Johnson to tie the game 2–2 in the bottom of the 9th inning; the second one came off of Brian Matusz in the bottom of the 12th—a walk-off home run to give the Yankees a 3–2 victory and a two-games-to-one series advantage. The pinch-hit performance set several major league records: he became the first player in major league history to hit two home runs in a postseason game he did not start; the first to hit two home runs in the 9th inning or later of a postseason game; the oldest player to hit a postseason walk-off home run; and the oldest player to hit two home runs in a postseason game.\n\nTwo days later in the deciding game 5 against the Orioles, Ibañez ended a scoreless tie with a single in the bottom of the 5th inning. The Yankees would rally around Ibañez, and win the game 3-1 and win the series. The next day, Ibañez once again hit a game-tying home run in the bottom of the 9th inning, this time in Game 1 of the 2012 American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers, becoming the first player ever to hit 3 home runs in the 9th inning or later in a single postseason. Despite the Yankees losing the series to the Tigers, Ibañez became a beloved New York sports figure.\n\nOn December 22, 2012, Ibañez agreed to a one-year deal worth $2.75 million with Seattle. The deal was made official four days later.\nIbañez hit .158 in April, but rebounded in May by batting .297 with 7 HR and 17 RBI. On July 2, he hit his 20th HR of the season. Fifth most in the American League at the time, he became the oldest player in major league history to hit 20 HR before the All-Star break. On September 21, Ibañez hit his 29th home run, tying Ted Williams for most home runs in a season by anyone 40 or older. After the season, Ibañez was honored with the Hutch Award. During the 2013 season, Ibañez batted .242 with 29 home runs and 65 RBI in 124 games played.\n\nOn December 27, 2013, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Ibañez officially agreed to terms on a one-year contract. On May 15, 2014, in the bottom of the 9th inning, Ibañez hit game-tying three run home run off of New York Mets pitcher José Valverde, in which the Angels lost by a solo home run by Anthony Recker, later in the game, by a final score of 6-7. On June 21, the Angels released Ibañez. In 57 games with the Angels, Ibañez hit .157 with 3 home runs and 21 RBIs.\n\nOn June 30, the Kansas City Royals signed Ibañez.\nOn July 2, he hit his first home run of the season.\n\nWith the team struggling with a 48-50 win-loss record on July 21, following comments by manager Ned Yost that the team needed to improve its play, Ibañez led a players-only meeting, which players including Eric Hosmer and Lorenzo Cain credited with turning around the attitudes of the players. The Royals then won 24 of their next 30, secured a wild card berth, and reached the 2014 World Series, losing to the San Francisco Giants. Ibañez was not on the Royals' postseason roster, except for the Wild Card Game, in which he did not appear.\n\nHaving interviewed for the Tampa Bay's managerial position vacated by Joe Maddon, the club named Ibañez as one of three finalists on November 21, 2014. He had not yet officially retired as a player at the time.\n\nOn February 2, 2016, he was hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers as a special assistant to the President of Baseball Operations, Andrew Friedman.\n\nIn April 2016, ESPN hired Ibañez as an analyst to replace Curt Schilling. \n\nIbañez and his wife Teryvette have two sons and three daughters.\n\nIn the 2009 offseason, Ibañez discovered he had allergies to gluten and dairy and went on a special diet, for which he had meals delivered from Philadelphia, even while on the road.\n\nIn a poll of 290 Major League players by \"Sports Illustrated\", Ibañez was voted the second nicest major league player, after Jim Thome.\n\n\n"}

Game makers have created dozens of mahjong titles for arcades and home consoles, but none have ever been officially released outside Asia. Some operating systems have included a Mahjong game, such as Solaris, Windows (\"Mahjong Titans\"), OS/2, and AmigaOS.\n\nJapanese computer mahjong games typically challenge serious players, such as Athena's \"Pro Mahjong Kiwame\" series. For example, many Japanese video arcades feature games like Konami's \"Mahjong Fight Club\" that feature online play, allowing people across the country to play against one another.\n\nMany computer mahjong games play a variant of the Japanese game known as \"taisen mahjong\" or \"battle mahjong.\" Here, a single player goes head-to-head against a cartoon character controlled by the software. The game is shortened for faster play, so that each player is only allowed eighteen discards. Scoring is counted as usual. The contest typically ends when one of the opponents' score reaches zero. A good example of this genre is the 1992 Sega arcade game \"Tokoro San no MahMahjan\".\n\nMahjong solitaire is a puzzle game based on the same tiles. The goal is to match open pairs of identical tiles and remove them from the board, exposing the tiles under them for play. The game is finished when all pairs of tiles have been removed from the board or when there are no exposed pairs remaining.\n\nThe player also has the option to play Japanese mahjong (with English text) as one of the various mini-games in Sega's gangster games, Yakuza 2 (PS2) and Yakuza 4 (PS3).

It connects the Swiss, Grisonian Thusis to the north below the pass with the Italian Chiavenna to the south at the end of the Valle San Giacomo below the pass.\n\nThe pass road connects the Swiss Hinterrhein valley and Splügen in the canton of Graubünden with the Valle San Giacomo and Chiavenna in the Italian province of Sondrio, the road continuing to Lake Como. The pass is the water divide between the drainage basins of the Rhine, which flows into the North Sea, and the Po, which flows into the Adriatic. The pass is overlooked by Pizzo Tambo and the Surettahorn, on its western and eastern side respectively. On the Italian side of the pass is Montespluga, a small three street village which is cut off from both Italy and Switzerland during the winter.\n\nSince the opening of the San Bernardino road tunnel in 1967, the pass has lost its former importance; it is not kept open in winter. Thanks to its lack of importance it is now a quiet pass where essential portions of the historical roads have survived allowing a good historical review for hikers on the \"Via Spluga\".\n\nThe pass was already in use in the Roman era. It possibly corresponds to \"Cunus Aureus\" shown on the Tabula Peutingeriana (which may alternatively have referred to the Julier Pass). The name \"Splügen\" itself is possibly derived from \"specula\" (\"lookout\"). In the Middle Ages, the Bishops of Chur had the trade route relocated to Septimer Pass.\n\nFrom 1818 to 1823 the modern road was built at the behest of the Austrian authorities, then ruling the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia in the south. In 1840, author Mary Shelley traveled through the pass on the way to Lake Como with her son. She describes the pass in her travel narrative, \"Rambles in Germany and Italy\", published in 1844:\n\nIn 1843 the road was further expanded with a long avalanche gallery designed by the Swiss engineer Richard La Nicca which today is out of use but largely preserved. Plans to build a railroad line across Splügen Pass were abandoned in favour of the Gotthard railway opened in 1882.\n\nThe Pass is also mentioned in Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\", a Sherlock Holmes short story of 1924. The Austrian Baron Adalbert Grüner, the villain of the story, murdered his wife by throwing her from the Pass, although Holmes cannot prove it.\n\n\n\n"}

It can be dated to a sudden conception Romains had in October 1903 of a 'communal spirit' or joint 'psychic life' in groups of people. It is based on ideas of collective consciousness and collective emotion, and on crowd behavior, where members of a group do or think something simultaneously. Unanimism is about an artistic merger with these group phenomena, which transcend the consciousness of the individual. Harry Bergholz writes that \"grossly generalizing, one might describe its aim as the art of the psychology of human groups\". Because of this collective emphasis, common themes of unanimist writing include politics and friendship.\n\nThe primary unanimist work is Romains's multi-volume cycle of novels \"Les Hommes de bonne volonté (Men of Good Will)\", the ideas in which can be traced back to \"La vie unanime\". The narrative jumps from character to character, rather than following one at a time, in an effort to reveal the nature and experience of the group as a whole.\n\nOther writers sometimes called \"unanimistes\"—many associated with the Abbaye de Créteil—include Georges Chennevière, Henri-Martin Barzun, Alexandre Mercereau, Pierre Jean Jouve, Georges Duhamel, Luc Durtain, Charles Vildrac and René Arcos.\n\n"}

As a boy singer, he sang at a concert – \"The Feast of St. Cecillia\" – in 1695. Before 1722, he had settled in London, and according to Charles Burney had a benefit concert that year. He appears to have become a fashionable singer, as his volume, dedicated to Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales, contains a lengthy list of notable persons as subscribers.\n\nHe was the editor of the first collection of Scottish folk songs published together with their melodies. This is a folio named \"Orpheus Caledonius, a collection of the best Scotch songs set to Musick\", entered at Stationers' Hall on 5 January 1725. The book consists of 50 songs with their airs, along with a simple accompaniment. A second volume, in two volumes octavo, had another 50 added.\n\nThe two editions are interesting and valuable, although Sir John Hawkins described him as \"a tradesman\" and said that his collection was injudicious and incorrect.

The expression dates to at least 1860. \"Wicked laugh\" can be found even earlier, dating back to at least 1784. Another variant, the \"sardonic laugh,\" shows up in 1714 and might date back even further.\n\nIn comic books, where supervillains utter such laughs, they are variously rendered as \"mwahahaha\", \"muwhahaha\", \"muahahaha\", \"bwahahaha\", etc. These words are also commonly used on internet blogs, bulletin board systems, and games. There, they are generally used when some form of victory is attained, or to indicate superiority over someone else (ownage), or also mockingly at a statement one finds hard to believe was uttered in earnestness. \n\nDuring the 1930s, the popular radio program \"The Shadow\" used a signature evil laugh as part of its presentation. This was voiced by actor Frank Readick, and his laugh was used even after Orson Welles took over the lead role. The evil laugh voiced by Vincent Price has been used or copied many times in radio, film, music, and television, notably at the end of the music video \"Michael Jackson's Thriller\".\n\nIn films, evil laughter often fills the soundtrack when the villain is off-camera. In such cases, the laughter follows the hero or victim as they try to escape. An example is in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", where Belloq's laugh fills the South American jungle as Indiana Jones escapes from the Hovitos.\n\n"}

His works include the play \"Knock ou le Triomphe de la médecine\", and a cycle of works called \"Les Hommes de bonne volonté (Men of Good Will)\". Sinclair Lewis called him one of the six best novelists in the world.\n\nHe was nominated for the Nobel prize in literature sixteen times.\n\nJules Romains was born in Saint-Julien-Chapteuil in the Haute-Loire but went to Paris to attend first the Lycée Condorcet and then the prestigious École Normale Supérieure. He was close to the Abbaye de Créteil, a utopian group founded in 1906 by Charles Vildrac and René Arcos, which brought together, among others, the writer Georges Duhamel, the painter Albert Gleizes and the musician Albert Doyen. He received his agrégation in philosophy in 1909.\n\nIn the interwar years, he pleaded the cause of pacifism and a united Europe against incipient fascism and despotism. In 1927, he signed a petition (that appeared in the magazine \"Europe\" on 15 April) against the law on the general organization of the nation in time of war, abrogating all intellectual independence and all freedom of expression. His name on the petition appeared with those of Lucien Descaves, Louis Guilloux, Henry Poulaille, Séverine... and those of the young Raymond Aron and Jean-Paul Sartre from the École normale supérieure.\n\nHis novel \"The Boys in the Back Room\" (\"Les Copains\", literally \"the pals\") appeared in English in 1937.\n\nDuring World War II he went into exile first to the United States where he spoke on the radio through the Voice of America and then, beginning in 1941, to Mexico where he participated with other French refugees in founding the Institut Français d'Amérique Latine (IFAL).\n\nA writer on many varied topics, Jules Romain was elected to the Académie française on 4 April 1946, occupying chair 12 (of 40). He served as President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers from 1936 to 1941. In 1964, Jules Romains was named citizen of honor of Saint-Avertin. Following his death in Paris in 1972, his place in the Académie française was taken by Jean d'Ormesson.\n\nJules Romains is remembered today, among other things, for his concept of Unanimism and his cycle of novels in \"Les Hommes de bonne volonté (The Men of Good Will)\", a remarkable literary fresco depicting the odyssey over a quarter century of two friends, the writer Jallez and politician Jerphanion, who provide an example in literature of Unanimism.\n\nRomains originally considered unanimism to mean an opposition to individualism or to the exaltation of individual particularities; universal sympathy with life, existence and humanity. In later years, Romains defined it as connected with the end of literature within \"representation of the world without judgment\", where his social ideals comprise the highest conception of solidarity as a defense of individual rights. His first book was \"La vie unanime\", published in 1904, and in the preface to \"Men of Goodwill\" he identified the ideas in it as essentially the same as those of that later work.\n\nThe Red Envelope catalog company, in their 2007 Holiday catalog, surprisingly featured \"Les Createurs\" on the cover in a photograph, showing a female model playfully frustrated with her husband, a male model posing as a detached intellectual, half-heartedly helping her to decorate the Christmas tree, while his attention is focused on reading \"Les Createurs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This white powder is soluble in alcohols and common organic solvents but is insoluble in water. It is often used as a foamer in plastics and rubber and as a radical initiator.\n\nIn its most characteristic reaction, AIBN decomposes, eliminating a molecule of nitrogen gas to form two 2-cyanoprop-2-yl radicals:\n\nThese radicals can initiate free-radical polymerizations and other radical-induced reactions. For instance, a mixture of styrene and maleic anhydride in toluene will react if heated, forming the copolymer upon addition of AIBN. Another example of a radical reaction that can be initiated by AIBN is the anti-Markovnikov hydrohalogenation of alkenes.\n\nAIBN is produced from acetone cyanohydrin and hydrazine, then followed by oxidation:\n\nRelated azo compounds behave similarly, such as 1,1′-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile). Water-soluble azo initiators are also available.\n\nAIBN is safer to use than benzoyl peroxide (another radical initiator) because the risk of explosion is far less. However, it is still considered as an explosive compound, decomposing above 65 °C. A respirator dust mask, protective gloves and safety glasses are recommended. Pyrolysis of AIBN without a trap for the formed 2-cyanopropyl radicals results in the formation of tetramethylsuccinonitrile, which is highly toxic.\n"}

In fact, Liu's decision to continue training for another four years after a disappointing performance at the 1996 Olympics (where she failed to make the beam final because of a fall in the team competition) was partly to realize her mother's unfulfilled dream.\n\nIn 2000, Liu became China's first Olympic champion on balance beam, as well as its first all-around medalist in women's gymnastics. She also led the Chinese team to a third-place finish, but in 2010, their bronze medal was stripped by the International Olympic Committee and awarded to the United States instead after one of the Chinese team members, Dong Fangxiao, was found to have been underage during the competition.

Developed in the early 1950s, the weapon entered service with the French army in 1957. Production ended in 1974 after approximately 140,000 had been built.\n\nThe missile was developed by the French Government agency - DTAT (\"Direction Technique des Armements Terrestres\") at the same time as the private industry SS.10. Development time for the ENTAC was longer than the SS.10, so it did not enter service until 1957. It proved to be a great improvement over the SS.10, which had entered production five years earlier. Once fully developed and tested, production of the ENTAC was given to the firm of Aerospatiale. The ENTAC was designed to be a man-portable weapon or operated from a small vehicle like the Jeep, replacing the Nord SS.10 in French service.\n\nThe missile is launched from a simple metal box, which is connected to an operator station. An individual operator station can control up to 10 launcher boxes. The operator manually steers the missile by means of a small joystick. These course corrections are transmitted to the missile via a thin set of wires that trail behind the missile - see MCLOS. Like many early ATGMs, the missile had a large minimum range (see AT-3 Sagger) due to the time it took to get up to flight speed and come under operator control.\n\nUsed from 1964 until 1982.\n\nThe missile first entered service in 1957. The ENTAC may have been used by France in small numbers during the 1960s and 1970s on peacekeeping operations.\n\nENTAC missiles entered service in 1968 after being ordered a year prior. They may have been used against Pakistani tanks during the 1971 war.\n\nOrdered in 1966 and delivered from 1966-1969. It remained in service after the 1979 Iranian revolution and was used against Iraqi tanks during the 1980-88 war.\n\nEntered service in 1963 after being ordered the year before. It is likely that they were used during the 1967 Six-Day War against Arab tanks.\n\nOrdered in 1966 and entered service in 1967. These were deployed during the Lebanese Civil War and was used in street fighting, particularly during the early 1980s.\n\nFrench-made missiles were in the inventory, alongside locally manufactured licence-built missiles. Having acquired some 500 examples by 1969, expeditionary units of the South African Defence Force first deployed ENTACs against People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and Cuban military advisers during Operation Savannah. The system was often mounted on unarmoured Land Rovers. South African servicemen destroyed at least one FAPLA mortar position with their missiles in September 1975. Two Angolan T-54/55 tanks were also eliminated by ENTAC crews, working in concert with Eland and Ratel-90 armoured cars, during Operation Askari, 1984.\n\nThe US army purchased the Model 58 ENTAC with an improved warhead to replace the Nord SS.10 (or MGM-21A). It was designed to be an interim weapon, used as the BGM-71 TOW was being developed. The first missiles were deployed in 1963, that year the missile received the US designation MGM-32A. In US service the missile was based on the M151 Jeep and issued to the Anti-tank Platoon of the Heavy Weapons Company. In Korea (7th ID @ 1st CAV) it replaced the Scorpion tracked AT vehicle, a 90MM SP Gun which could not climb the hilly terrain as easily as the Jeep. Using extended cables missiles could be fired from defilade. The missile was phased out between 1968 and 1969, being replaced with the more advanced BGM-71 TOW. It was used in the Vietnam War against fortified infantry positions, but not enemy tanks. It was fired by the 14th Infantry Regiment, amongst others.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the last former British Indian Army officer to command the Indian Army.\n\nDuring his army career, he had commanded the Operation Blue Star under orders from Indira Gandhi to clear the Golden Temple shrine. This was criticized widely as a military failure, with accusations of human rights violations. He introduced a number of technology initiatives to the Indian Army. He was also questioned for his role in recommending the Bofors howitzer in the Bofors Scandal. As the Chief of Army Staff, he planned and executed Operation Brasstacks, a major military exercise, along the Rajasthan border.\n\nSundarji was born in Tamil Iyengar Brahmin family Chengelpet, Madras Presidency, British India on 28 April 1928. His official name was Krishnaswamy Sundararajan, but he was popularly known by the informal name of Sundarji. He studied at the Madras Christian College only to leave it before receiving a degree. Later in his career, he graduated from the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington, Tamil Nadu. He also studied at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in the US, and the National Defence College in New Delhi. He held a Master of Arts in international studies from Allahabad University and an MSc in defence studies from Madras University.\n\nSundarji joined the British Indian Army in 1945 during the Second World War, though the war ended before he could see any active service. On 28 April 1946, he was given an emergency commission as a second lieutenant in the Mahar Regiment. His early career as an army officer involved operating in the troublesome areas of the North-West Frontier Province and then in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nIn the period following India's independence, he saw action in Kargil district, Jammu and Kashmir, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948. \n\nIn 1963 he served in the UN mission in the Congo, where he was chief of staff of the Katanga command and was mentioned in dispatches for his gallantry.\n\nSundarji served as the commanding officer of an infantry battalion during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.\n\nHe played an important role as Brigadier General Staff of a corps in the Rangpur sector of Bangladesh, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. This war led to the liberation of Bangladesh. As an acting brigadier, he was appointed Deputy Military Secretary, Army HQ, on 20 January 1973.\n\nSundarji was promoted to major general on 26 July 1974. For the first time in the history of Indian Army, an infantry officer became the general officer commanding (GOC) of the elite 1st Armoured Division. He was chosen by Gen. KV Krishna Rao to be part of a small team for reorganising the Indian Army, especially with regard to technology. He raised the Mechanised Infantry Regiment by amalgamating various battalions from the army's premier infantry regiments.\n\nHe was promoted to lieutenant general on 5 February 1979. In 1984, he led Operation Blue Star, intended to evict Sikh extremists who had occupied the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The Indian Army marched into the temple with their boots off. He later said \"We went inside with humility in our hearts and prayers on our lips\". According to his wife, Sundarji emerged a changed man after this operation.\n\nIn 1986, he was promoted to general and appointed Chief of Army Staff (COAS) after the assassination of General A.S. Vaidya. After taking over as COAS, he wrote a letter to his soldiers warning of deteriorating standards, and the evil of sycophancy. His operation at Sumdorong Chu in 1986, known as Operation Falcon, was widely praised. The Chinese had occupied Sumdorong Chu and Sundarji used the Indian Air Force's new airlift capability to land a brigade in Zimithang, north of Tawang. Indian forces took up positions on the Hathung La ridge, across the Namka Chu river, where India had faced a humiliating defeat in 1962. The Chinese responded with a counter-build-up and adopted a belligerent tone. Western diplomats predicted war and some of prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's advisers blamed Sundarji's recklessness. But Sundarji stood by his steps, at one point telling a senior aide, \"Please make alternate arrangements if you think you are not getting adequate professional advice.\" The confrontation petered out.\n\nHe was also involved in Operation Brasstacks, a large-scale mechanised artillery and war gaming effort in July 1986 near the Pakistan border, which led to similar Pakistani buildup. The situation was defused through diplomatic talks in February 1987.\n\nIn 1987, the Indian government agreed to a Sri Lankan request and the Indian Peace Keeping Force was sent to Jaffna to disarm the LTTE. However, the Indian Army had no experience in unconventional jungle warfare and took heavy casualties. Among the few successes was the bombing of the LTTE controlled jetties by the Indian Navy Marine Commandos (MARCOS) then known as the Indian Navy Special Commando Force. The IPKF force was withdrawn in 1990.\n\nSundarji was amongst the core team that created Indian nuclear policy. As a senior army general, he wrote the Indian Nuclear Doctrine along with Admiral R.H. Tahiliani. Post retirement, he was unhappy with the lack of response among politicians regarding nuclear security, and wrote the book \"Blind Men of Hindustan\" in 1993, which discussed nuclear strategy for India and compared India's nuclear policy to six blind men who misinterpret an elephant by touching parts of it.\n\nSundarji was amongst the most far-sighted armoured corps commanders in the Indian Army. Despite being commissioned in the infantry, he was a keen student and admirer of tank warfare. He pioneered various operational guidelines and challenged his commanders to push the machines and men to the limits. In various exercises he is known to have ordered tanks full speed up sand dunes in the Thar desert in 70 degree heat. Amongst other things he designed the all black uniform of the Armoured Corps. He then went on to create the Mechanised Infantry Regiment. With emphasis on speed, technology and mobile weaponry it is now an integral part of the Indian strike corps.\n\nSundarji can also be credited for shaping modern Indian Army thinking. In his stint as the Commandant of the College of Combat (now Army War College, Mhow), he practically rewrote the war manual with emphasis on speed, decisive action, technology and his abiding love – armour. Sundarji was also one of the few to predict the total rout of the Iraqi forces in the Gulf War. Writing for India Today, he was amongst the few who clearly saw what superior air power and technology could do.\n\nHe also left behind a partially completed autobiography titled ‘Of Some Consequence: A Soldier Remembers', of which he had completed 33 episodes out of a planned 105.\n\nSundarji married Padma Sundarji when he was a major. They had two children, Pria and Vikram. In 1978, when he was serving as general officer commanding (GOC) XXXIII Corps in the Eastern Command, she died of cancer at the Army Hospital, Delhi Cantonment. Later, he married for the second time.

In Hindu mythology, it is referred to as the physical holy location where a temple or a collection of temples, its tank and deities exist.\n\nThere exist privileged regions and places where energy in the form of terrestrial magnetism rises heavenward. As per Hindu religious mythology, Prana (gravity) pulls life downwards, while apanan (levity) pulls life upwards. Such places are called Tirtha (ways), Kshetra (ways) or pitha (base). Sacred geography can identify sacred places and sometimes explain the importance of those which are already known.\n\nThe dwelling of gods must be built on such privileged ground (kshetras), and, as a rule, sacred cities arise around them. The temple should be close to a water course or near a lake located to the east or north. For the building of a temple, it should have a lake on the left (north) or in front (east), and not otherwise. If the temple is built on an island, the presence of water all around is of good omen.\n\n"}

These objects do not exist as anything other than projected computer graphics.\n\nOpenIllusionist is closely connected with the Media Engineering Group (MEG) of the Department of Electronics at the University of York, UK - specifically the Visual Systems subgroup. This group was formed when John Robinson took up a professorship in the Department in 2000/2001, bringing with him a background in image coding and an interest in augmented reality. \n\nThis manifested itself in the work of three undergraduates - Dan Parnham, who experimented with the interpretation of the pose of a mannequin by the use of a single webcam focussed exclusively on the input side of the augmentation problem during his Masters degree, Sean O'Mahoney, who developed the first incarnation what would come to be termed PenPets as his Masters project, and Enrico Costanza, who developed a variety of tangible augmented interfaces using fiducials stuck to blocks of wood, with augmentation provided variously by audio feedback (\"Audio d-Touch\"), and a projector (\"Magic Desk\"). Much of Audio d-Touch was created by Enrico in his spare time as a personal project, (with collaboration from the aforementioned Robinson, and Simon Shelley, another York alumni) while the Magic Desk became his Masters project.\n\nAll of these projects fed into a collective culture in the group - with Justen Hyde, then a research student studying the reconstruction of human facial images, getting sucked into the work, making minor contributions to all of the projects, though officially working on none of them. The projects most often wheeled out to demonstrations were quickly established as PenPets (O'Mahoney) and d-Touch (Costanza) both of which had a strong commonality - they appeared to work by magic. The computer could be hidden from view, and the user could then simply interact with the augmentation directly. In the case of d-Touch, by moving marked blocks in front of a webcam to sample, edit and produce music with very low-cost paraphernalia - just a cheap microphone, printed fiducials and a standard PC. PenPets required more of a hardware overhead - a data projector pointed at a table. Onto this agents resembling mice were projected. These would run around the table, bouncing off hands, pen marks and objects.\n\nAfter O'Mahoney and Costanza left the group, in 2002 and 2003 respectively, d-Touch continued to be developed by Costanza, but PenPets remained only a proof-of-concept, not technically beyond the prototype stage, and was mothballed. Parnham and Hyde continued to work on other aspects of image processing. However, the desire to work on a VAE was far from lost... Funding, as ever, was the only stumbling block, along with the unsuitability of the PenPets code for further development and expansion.\n\nIn 2004, a new Centre for Usable Home Technology was launched at York. As part of the launch event, a virtual augmented environment was promised - but upon inspection the PenPets demo, which had been considered, was found to be unreliable outside a laboratory environment, and almost impossible to maintain with no developer available with any experience with the code. In order to provide a demo, Hyde and Parnham, in their own time, went away and using all that had been learned in the years of development of the various group project, designed and built a new interactive aLife demo from scratch in the space of a week. As PenPets had never made it beyond experimental prototype stage, they decided to bite the bullet and rather than building just a demo instead built a basic but extensible generic augmented reality framework upon which an aLife demo could be run. This framework became the core of the OpenIllusionist Project.\n\nOver the latter half of 2004, interest in the framework put together for this demo escalated, and the advantages of maintaining a framework upon which VAE development could be carried out became readily apparent. Instead of weeks to build a stable VAE demo application, results could be achieved in hours. The extensible structure of the proto-Illusionist meant that applications completely unlike the original aLife demo were being supported with relative ease. In the Autumn of 2004, it was decided that the framework was more useful and important than any given implementation of a demo on that framework - and also that an opportunity presented itself to begin the push to get augmented desktops out of research labs, and into circulation with the general public. The demo framework became an entity in its own right - the Illusionist - and was published as open source software.\n\nSince then, development has continued, with the project still administered and run by the two founders, Dan Parnham and Justen Hyde.\nIn 2006 \"Robot Ships\", an exhibit built using OpenIllusionist, was installed in the new Connect gallery at the National Museum of Scotland.\n\nOpenIllusionist initially ran only on Microsoft Windows, though latest versions are implemented using wxWidgets and so are inherently cross-platform. However, due to the amount of hardware interfacing required by OpenIllusionist, video capture on other platforms (such as Linux) is still in early development.\n\n"}

This is the original Nankai High School, and it is often referred to as Nankai High School in Tianjin to differentiate it from Chongqing Nankai Middle School, its sister school in Chongqing. Nankai is notable as one of the first modern secondary schools in China, and boasts several of the most notable men in modern Chinese history as its alumni. The main campus is located on 22 Nankai 4th Rd, Nankai Qu, Tianjin Shi, China. The other two campuses are in Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city and Haihe Jiaoyu Yuanqu, Tianjin.\n\nNankai High School was founded in 1904 by Yan Xiu (also known as Yan Fansun). Nankai was originally a private school, featuring a western-style college-preparatory curricula instead of a traditional Confucian curriculum. It was the first school in the Nankai Family of Schools. This system would latter be expanded to include Nankai University in 1919. Nankai University would become one of China's most prestigious universities.\n\nBefore his work at Nankai, Yan Xiu was an intellectual with a strong understanding of traditional Chinese culture who had held positions at the prestigious Hanlin Academy earlier in his career, and in both China's provincial and central governments. The difficulties that confronted China in the late nineteenth century led Yan to become interested in Western and Japanese models of education, to which he attributed the contemporary strength of the West and Japan. Yan's experiences working within the Chinese bureaucracy led him to believe that only the most progressive reforms could save China from further decline.\n\nYan Xiu belonged to a group of reform-minded intellectuals who, in 1905, presented a memorial that suggested abolishing the traditional examination system, focused on knowledge of the Confucian classics, to a system of education focused on practical knowledge. Yan's memorial was well received by the Qing government, which was by then interested in reform as a way to preventing the dynasty from destruction. After he had received a mandate for reform, Yan took part in a large-scale educational reform aimed at modernizing the educational institutions throughout China. After the Qing dynasty was abolished in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, Yan was offered several high-level government positions, but refused them all in preference to devoting his time and energy to the establishment of Nankai.\n\nAfter 1911 Yan Xiu appointed Zhang Boling as Nankai's principal. Zhang had been a well-known advocate for reform and moral renewal during the Qing. By the time of his appointment, Zhang had already gained a reputation as a progressive modernist, advocating the inclusion of Western sciences and physical exercise into the Chinese curriculum. After his appointment as Nankai's principle, Zhang gained a reputation for pioneering educational methods that would be widely emulated throughout China within his lifetime.\n\nBy 1936, war between China and Japan seemed inevitable. The city of Tianjin was located near the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and was vulnerable to a Japanese attack in the event of war. In anticipation of this war, the administration of the Nankai Schools established another high school in Chongqing, far to the southwest in the interior of China. This school would become known as Nankai High School in Chongqing.\n\nWhen the War of Resistance against Japan began in September 1937, all the faculty and students at Nankai High School were evacuated to the sister school in Chongqing, where the school would remain for the duration of the war. Nankai University and other Chinese universities were also evacuated to the cities of Changsha and (later) Kunming. After the war ended in 1945, Nankai High School was relocated back to its original campus in Tianjin. However, the Nankai High School in Chongqing remained in operation and still exists to this day.\n\nAfter his appointment as principle, Zhang Boling implemented a synthesis of Japanese and American methods that were grounded in traditional Chinese concepts of self-cultivation. Zhang devised Nankai's curriculum in the attempt to produce students who could overcome the five illnesses that Zhang believed afflicted China in his time: ignorance; weakness; poverty; disunity; and selfishness. Zhang believed that only an education that combined physical education, group activities, scientific education, and moral cultivation could produce leaders who would later contribute to rebuilding China. Zhang created a school motto composed of the characters \"gong\" (public spirit) and \"neng\" (ability), expressing his hope that his students would develop into leaders with a spirit of integrity, dedication, and civic responsibility who would also have the practical abilities necessary to confront China's difficulties.\n\nNankai was a boarding school with strict schedules, discipline, and moral codes, and promoted a strict daily schedule of student activities, similar to contemporary British schools. Zhang placed great importance on physical activity, and worked hard to break down traditional Chinese attitudes of contempt for physical exercise and manual labour. Zhang considered himself as both a teacher and a role model to his students, attempting to personally instruct them in basic principles of hygiene, eating with students, and participating in their exercises. Zhang's close association with his students was unusual in China (and elsewhere), but contributed to the admiration that most of his students reportedly felt for him throughout their lives.\n\nToday, Nankai High School is a public school best known for its success in preparing students for the National College Entrance Examination 高考 (Gāokǎo). The graduates of the school are typically admitted to the best universities in China and around the world. Its college-preparatory curricula covers a wide range of subjects in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences. The school also encourages its students to take part in various academic extracurricular activities, including the International Science Olympiad. Between 1998 and 2005, four Nankai students became IPhO gold medal winners. Nankai students also received gold medals in IMO, IChO, IBO, and IOI.\n\nAdmission to Nankai High School is usually selective and is based on an applicant's primary school grades and performance on an entrance exam. In 2005, 4,000 students were admitted to Nankai. The school is supported by 300 faculty and staff. The current school principal is Ma Yuemei.\n\nIn the early 2000s the school established a twinning relationship with a school in the United Kingdom, Manningtree High School. Following the establishment of this relationship, students from both schools visited each other in a series of exchange visits. The most recent visit was in 2008, where Nankai hosted Manningtree during the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThe most famous graduate of Nankai High School was Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China. Zhou's skill in literature and composition won him several awards and scholarships, and caught the attention of Nankai's founder, Yan Xiu. Yan once proposed that Zhou marry his daughter, but Zhou declined. Zhou later explained (to a classmate, Zhang Honghao) that his decision not to marry Yan's daughter was due to fears that Zhou could not financially support a family, and that Yan, as his father-in-law, would dominate Zhou's future.\n\nZhou's accomplishments and personal qualities led him to be selected as the speaker at his graduating class, in June 1917. Zhou's experience at Nankai has been cited as a foundation of Zhou's emotional resilience and intellectual growth. Zhang's teachings of \"gong\" and \"neng\" had been so deeply ingrained in Zhou that he left the school with a great desire to pursue public service, and to acquire the skills necessary to do so. Zhou's participation in debates and stage performances at Nankai contributed to the eloquence and persuasiveness that Zhou would later display throughout his political career.\n\nSeveral other national leaders were also graduates from the school, including another Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, several university presidents, and more than sixty academicians. Since established in 2001, seven recipients of the annual Top National Scientist Awards were Nankai High School graduates, including Liu Dongsheng (2003), Ye Duzheng (2005), Wu Liangyong (2011) and Zhang Cunhao (2013). Famous Nankai alumni include:\n\nIn addition to its alumni, several famous writers were once members of the faculty at Nankai High School, including:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2231892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231892", "title": "War of succession", "text": "War of succession\n\nA war of succession or succession war is a war prompted by a succession crisis in which two or more individuals claim the right of successor to a deceased or deposed monarch. The rivals are typically supported by factions within the royal court. Foreign powers sometimes intervene, allying themselves with a faction. This may widen the war into one between those powers.\n\nIn historiography and literature, a \"war of succession\" may also be referred to as a \"succession dispute\", \"dynastic struggle\", \"internecine conflict\", \"fratricidal war\", or any combination of these terms. Not all of these are necessarily describing armed conflict, however, and the dispute may be resolved without escalating into open warfare. Wars of succession are also often referred to as a \"civil\" war, when in fact it was a conflict within the royalty, or broader aristocracy, that civilians were dragged into, and may therefore be a misnomer, or at least a misleading characterisation.\n\nA war of succession is a type of intrastate war concerning struggle for the throne: a conflict about supreme power in a monarchy. It may become an interstate war if foreign powers intervene. A succession war may arise after (or sometimes even before) a universally recognised ruler over a certain territory passes away (sometimes without leaving behind any (legal) offspring), or is declared insane or otherwise incapable to govern, and is deposed. Next, several pretenders step forward, who are either related to the previous ruler and therefore claim to have a right to their possessions based on the hereditary principle, or have concluded a treaty to that effect. They will seek allies within the nobility and/or abroad to support their claims to the throne. After all options for a diplomatic solution –such as a sharing of power, or a financial deal– or a quick elimination –e.g. by assassination or arrest– have been exhausted, a military confrontation will follow. Quite often such succession disputes can lead to long-lasting wars.\n\nSome wars of succession are about women's right to inherit. This does not exist in some countries (a \"sword fief\", where the Salic law applies, for example), but it does in others (a \"spindle fief\"). Often a ruler who has no sons, but does have one or more daughters, will try to change the succession laws so that a daughter can succeed him. Such amendments will then be declared invalid by opponents, invoking the local tradition.\n\nIn some cases, wars of succession could also be centred around the reign in prince-bishoprics. Although these were formally elective monarchies without hereditary succession, the election of the prince-bishop could be strongly intertwined with the dynastic interests of the noble families involved, each of whom would put forward their own candidates. In case of disagreement over the election result, waging war was a possible way of settling the conflict. In the Holy Roman Empire, such wars were known as diocesan feuds.\n\nIt can sometimes be difficult to determine whether a war was purely or primarily a war of succession, or that other interests were at play as well that shaped the conflict in an equally or more important manner, such ideologies (religions, secularism, nationalism, liberalism, conservatism), economy, territory and so on. Many wars are not called 'war of succession' because hereditary succession was not the most important element, or despite the fact that it \"was\". Similarly, wars can also be unjustly branded a 'war of succession' whilst the succession was actually not the most important issue hanging in the balance.\n\nThe origins of succession wars lie in feudal or absolutist systems of government, in which the decisions on war and peace could be made by a single sovereign without the population's consent. The politics of the respective rulers was mainly driven by dynastic interests. German historian Johannes Kunisch (1937–2015) ascertained: \"The all-driving power was the dynasties' law of the prestige of power, the expansion of power, and the desire to maintain themselves.\" Moreover, the legal and political coherence of the various provinces of a 'state territory' often consisted merely in nothing more than having a common ruler. Early government systems were therefore based on dynasties, the extinction of which immediately brought on a state crisis. The composition of the governmental institutions of the various provinces and territories also eased their partitioning in case of a conflict, just like the status of claims on individual parts of the country by foreign monarchs.\n\nTo wage a war, a justification is needed (\"Jus ad bellum\"). These arguments may be put forward in a declaration of war, to indicate that one is justly taking up arms. As the Dutch lawyer Hugo Grotius (1583–1645) noted, these must make clear that one is unable to pursue their rightful claims in any other way. The claims to legal titles from the dynastic sphere were a strong reason for war, because international relations primarily consisted of inheritance and marriage policies until the end of the Ancien Régime. These were often so intertwined that it had to lead to conflict. Treaties that led to hereditary linkages, pawning and transfers, made various relations more complicated, and could be utilised for claims as well. That claims were made at all is due to the permanent struggle for competition and prestige between the respective ruling houses. On top of that came the urge of contemporary princes to achieve \"glory\" for themselves.\n\nAfter numerous familial conflicts, the principle of primogeniture originated in Western Europe the 11th century, spreading to the rest of Europe (with the exception of Russia) in the 12th and 13th century; it has never evolved outside Europe. However, it has not prevented the outbreak of wars of succession. A true deluge of succession wars occurred in Europe between the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) and the Coalition Wars (1792–1815). According to German historian Heinz Duchhardt (1943) the outbreak of wars of succession in the early modern period was stimulated on the one hand by the uncertainty about the degree to which regulations and agreements on hereditary succession were to be considered a respectable part of emerging international law. On the other hand, there was also a lack of effective means to provide them recognition and validation.\n\nAccording to British statesman Henry Brougham (Lord Chancellor 1830–34), there were more and longer wars of succession in Europe between 1066 and the French Revolution (1789–99) than all other wars put together. \"A war of succession is the most lasting of wars. The hereditary principle keeps it in perpetual life – [whereas] a war of election is always short, and never revives\", he opined, arguing for elective monarchy to solve the problem.\n\nIn the Mughal Empire, there was no tradition of primogeniture. Instead it was customary for sons to overthrow their father, and for brothers to war to the death among themselves. In Andean civilizations such as the Inca Empire (1438–1533), it was customary for a lord to pass on his reign to the son he perceived to be the most able, not necessarily his oldest son; sometimes he chose a brother instead. After the Spanish colonization of the Americas began in 1492, some Andean lords began to assert their eldest-born sons were the only 'legitimate' heirs (as was common to European primogeniture customs), while others maintained Andean succession customs involving the co-regency of a younger son of a sitting ruler during the latter's lifetime, each whenever the circumstances favoured either approach.\n\nNote: Wars of succession in transcontinental states are mentioned under the continents where their capital city was located. Names of wars that have been given names by historians are capitalised; the others, whose existence has been proven but not yet given a specific name, are provisionally written in lowercase letters (except for the first word, geographical and personal names).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Holt (17 October 1864 – 10 June 1922) was an eminent English marine naturalist and biologist who specialized in ichthyology, the study of fish. His work helped lay a scientific foundation for the fishery management in Ireland, and together with William Spotswood Green, he strongly influenced the development of the Irish Fisheries in its early years.\n\nHolt was born in London and was educated at Eton, where he won a prize in biology. After school, he decided on a career in the British Army, enrolling at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and after completing his officer training was commissioned into the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. He participated in the Nile Campaign (1884/85) and then in the Third Burmese War of 1886/87. During that latter campaign, he fell sick and was invalided home. Back in civilian life, Holt began studying zoology at the University of St. Andrews in 1888.\n\nTwo years later, he participated as assistant-naturalist in a fishery survey on the west coast of Ireland, organized by the Royal Dublin Society. This expedition was led by William Spotswood Green, with whom Holt would work together for much of his later career. That survey made Holt's name as an ichthyologist; he published not only several papers on the eggs and the early larval stages of fish but also wrote the general report of the expedition. As a result of Green's and Holt's work, the government instituted a formal program of fishery surveys under the auspice of the newly formed Congested Districts Board in 1892. Green became the board's Chief Inspector of Fisheries, while Holt participated as a scientific advisor, although he would leave Ireland for a few years.\n\nHolt joined the Marine Biological Association (MBA) and worked until 1894 at Grimsby, where he was in charge of a newly opened research station for the North Sea. After a brief stint at the \"Station zoologique d'Endoume\" at Marseille he then worked for three years at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory. Nevertheless, E. W. L. Holt maintained his ties with Ireland, and in 1895 he purchased a dismasted brigantine named \"Saturn\" for the Royal Dublin Society and had it equipped as a marine biology research station. In 1899, he returned to Ireland, taking charge of the \"Saturn\" and her four small auxiliary sailing boats used for sampling. The floating laboratory was stationed in the Connemara district in County Galway; it lay at Ballynakill in winter and was towed to Inishbofin for the summer months. In 1900, the \"Saturn\" was transferred to the new Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland. Green became Chief Inspector of its Fisheries Branch; Holt was at first scientific advisor and later, as of 1908, Fisheries Inspector. They were joined by other young biologists, among them Rowland Southern and George Philip Farrar.\n\nWith the department's research and fisheries protection vessel \"Helga\" they continued their surveys of the west coast of Ireland. In 1908, the ship was replaced by a new one, the \"Helga II\", which was built to the specifications of Green and Holt. With Holt's backing, the new ship participated in the Clare Island Survey of 1909–1911. When that was completed, the \"Helga II\" returned to her regular fisheries research and protection duties under the direction of Holt.\n\nWhen Green retired in 1914, Holt succeeded him as Chief Inspector. Scientific work was stopped when World War I broke out, and the administrative duties of his post did not allow Holt to continue research work of his own. After the war, the political changes in Ireland as well as Holt's failing health prevented further serious research. In May 1922, Holt became seriously ill and left Dublin for London, where he died on 10 June that year of Bright's disease (an old term for glomerulonephritis, a kidney disease). In 1949, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food (MAFF) put into service a research vessel named after him.\n\n\n"}

Thus employability by this definition is about learning, not least learning how to learn, and it is about empowering learners as critical reflective citizens. Harvey‘s (2001) definition is important for it emphasizes the employability of graduates, which is similar to our context, hence, able to provide insight about how to measure graduates' employability and what are the differences between graduates and experienced individuals in the labor market.\n\nBerntson (2008) argues that employability refers to an individual's perception of his or her possibilities of getting new, equal, or better employment. Berntson's study differentiates employability into two main categories – actual employability (objective employability) and perceived employability (subjective employability).\n\nSeveral employability definitions have been developed based on, or including input from business and industry. In the United States, an Employability Skills Framework was developed through a collaboration of employers, educators, human resources associations, and labour market associations. This framework states, \"Employability skills are general skills that are necessary for success in the labor market at all employment levels and in all sectors\". After conducting research with employers across Canada, the Conference Board of Canada released Employability Skills 2000+, which defines employability as \"the skills you need to enter, stay in, and progress in the world of work\". Saunders & Zuzel (2010) found that employers valued personal qualities such as dependability and enthusiasm over subject knowledge and ability to negotiate.\n\nIn the future fewer will be employed and more people work as free lancers or ad hoc on projects. Robin Chase, co-founder of Zip Car, argues that in the future more work will be done as freelancers or ad hoc works. Collaborative economy and other similar platforms are reinventing capitalism, for example platforms like Freelancer.com, a new way of organizing demand and supply.\nFreelancer is also an example of how employability can be developed even for people who are not employed – Freelancers offers exposure of certification and in the future similar platforms will also offer continuous upgrade of competencies for the people associated.\nThe Complete University Guide website (based in London within the United Kingdom ) lists the ten most employable degree subjects, indicating the degree of employability with a percentage (of graduates exiting university who subsequently obtain employment). The subject with the most employment is Dentistry, the subjects with ordinately less employment, after the 1st most are as follows; Nursing, Veterinary Medicine, Medicine, Physiotherapy, Medical Technology, Optometry Ophthalmology Orthoptics, Occupational Therapy, Land and Property Management, Aural and Oral sciences \n\nEmployability creates organizational issues, because future competency needs may require re-organization in many ways. The increasing automation and use of technology also makes it relevant to discuss not only change but also transformation in tasks for people. The issues are relevant at government level, at corporate level and for individuals.\n\nIn the past, government had institutions to handle unemployment and employment. In the future this will be extended to include employability. In many parts of the world, Wheebox conducts 'National Employability Test' an online test that measures candidate's Business communication, Critical Thinking Skills, Numeracy, Coding Skills for IT, Learning Agility and Interpersonal Skills. \n\nSingapore has created an Institute for Employability that works on competency upgrades, to reduce risk of unemployment, and increase the competitiveness of the nation and corporations and the employability of the individual.\n\n\n\n"}

It has become a standard for the phase characterization of single & pure components. The other state description parameters are molecular weight, critical temperature, critical pressure, and critical volume (or critical compressibility). The acentric factor is said to be a measure of the non-sphericity (centricity) of molecules. As it increases, the vapor curve is \"pulled\" down, resulting in higher boiling points.\n\nIt is defined as:\n\nwhere\nformula_2 is the reduced temperature,\nformula_3 is the reduced saturation vapor pressure.\n\nFor many monatomic fluids\nis close to 0.1, therefore formula_5. In many cases, formula_6 lies above the boiling temperature of liquids at atmosphere pressure.\n\nValues of can be determined for any fluid from accurate experimental vapor pressure data. Preferably, these data should first be regressed against a vapor pressure equation, like . (In this regression, a careful check for erroneous vapor pressure measurements must be made, preferably using a log(P) vs. 1/T graph, and any obviously incorrect or dubious values should be discarded. The regression should then be re-run with the remaining good values until a good fit is obtained.) Using the known critical temperature, Tc, vapor pressure at Tr=0.7 can then be used in the defining equation, above, to estimate acentric factor.\n\nThe definition of gives essentially zero for the noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon. formula_7 is very close to zero for other spherical molecules. Values of correspond to vapor pressures above the critical pressure, and are non-physical.\n\nBy definition, a van der Waals fluid has a critical compressibility of 3/8 and an acentric factor of about −0.302024, indicating a small ultra-spherical molecule. A Redlich-Kwong fluid has a critical compressibility of 1/3 and an acentric factor of about 0.058280, close to nitrogen; without the temperature dependence of its attractive term, its acentric factor would be only -0.293572.\n\n"}

Educated in London and Oxford, he only took to natural history in his thirties, having worked as a teacher until then. Although an ordained Anglican priest, Stebbing promoted Darwinism in a number of popular works, and was banned from preaching as a result. His scientific works mostly concerned crustaceans, especially the Amphipoda and Isopoda, the most notable being his work on the amphipods of the \"Challenger\" expedition.\n\nThomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing was born on 6 February 1835 in Euston Square, London, the seventh of thirteen or fourteen children, to the clergyman and editor of the \"Athenaeum\", Henry Stebbing, and his wife, Mary Griffin. Thomas was educated at the King's College School, and afterwards entered King's College, London to study classics, graduating with a BA in 1855. He then matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford, before studied at Worcester College, Oxford, gaining a BA in law and modern history there in 1857 and an MA in 1859. Around this time, he was a master at Radley College and Wellington College. He took on various roles at Worcester College, including that of fellow (1860–1868), tutor (1865–1867), vice-provost (1865) and eventually dean (1866), as well as a lecturer in divinity. He resigned his fellowship in 1868. He was ordained into the Church of England by Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford in 1859.\n\nBy 1863, Stebbing had begun to work as a tutor in Reigate, Surrey, where he met the entomologist William Wilson Saunders, whose daughter Mary Anne was a capable botanist and illustrator. Stebbing took up the study of natural history around this time, and married Mary Anne in 1867. The couple moved to Torquay, Devon after their marriage, where Stebbing continued to work as a tutor and schoolmaster, and began to write about theology, Darwinism and natural history, partly under the influence of the naturalist William Pengelly.\n\nIn 1873, Stebbing produced his first paper on crustaceans, and began to study the Amphipoda the following year. In 1877, Stebbing moved to Royal Tunbridge Wells, where he lived in Ephraim Lodge, on the edge of Tunbridge Wells Common, to benefit from the greater number of students in London, and to be closer to the libraries, museums and scientific circles in the capital. As his finances improved, he was able to give up teaching altogether and concentrate on writing. He died in Ephraim Lodge on 8 July 1926. His funeral was held at St. Paul's Church, Rusthall, where Stebbing had officiated when requested; since its churchyard was inadequate, Stebbing's body was buried in the town's public cemetery. His wife survived him by only a few months.\n\nHaving trained as an evangelical Anglican, Stebbing expected to be a staunch opponent of Charles Darwin's recently published theory of evolution by natural selection. Stebbing reported that \"on reading \"The Origin of Species\", as a preliminary, it has to be confessed that, instead of confuting, I became his ardent disciple\", and so he adopted the position of a religious rationalist. Following a critical review of \"The Descent of Man\" in \"The Times\" in 1871, Stebbing gained prominence by responding in \"Nature\".\n\nStebbing wrote a number of essays on the topic of Darwinism, in which he dissected the argument posited against it, and questioned various aspects of Christianity, including the literal truth of the Book of Genesis, the doctrine of the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, many of the Thirty-Nine Articles, miracles and prophecy. They included \"Essays on Darwinism\" (1871), \"Faith in Fetters\" (1919) and \"Plain Speaking\" (1926). His outspoken stance resulted in his being banned from preaching, and he was never offered a parish by the church.\n\nMost of Stebbing's scientific works, comprising more than 110 papers, covered amphipod crustaceans. Rev. A. M. Norman, a member of the Challenger Committee, recommended that Stebbing produce a monograph on the amphipods collected on the 1872–1876 expedition by HMS \"Challenger\", which he did, reproducing the original description for every genus, and providing an extensive bibliography of the group.\n\nHe also produced a monograph of the Cumacea, a natural history of the Crustacea, and a biography of the Scottish naturalist and founder of the University Marine Biological Station, Millport, David Robertson. In 1906, Stebbing published the volume on Gammaridea for the series \"\".\nStebbing was made a Fellow of the Linnean Society on 5 December 1895, a Fellow of the Royal Society on 4 June 1896, and was awarded the Gold Medal of the Linnean Society in 1908. He had strenuously advocated the admittance of women to the Linnean Society, and obtained a supplementary charter to allow it; his wife was among the first women to be admitted.\n\nA number of animal species have been named in honour of Stebbing:\n\n\n"}

If the pigments are mixed with lime water or lime milk and applied to a dry plaster the technique is called lime secco painting. \nThe secco technique contrasts with the fresco technique, where the painting is executed on a layer of wet plaster.\n\nBecause the pigments do not become part of the wall, as in \"buon fresco\", fresco-secco paintings are less durable.

This technological change coincided with the realistic turn in Western art and the changing liturgical use of murals.\n\nThe treatise \"Silparatna\" by Kumaradeva (8th century) gives an account of the Fresco-secco painting technology in detail.

Born to the Grant's distillery family who created Glenfiddich whisky, he was one of Scotland's Great Officers of State for the last twelve years of his life.\n\nA classical scholar and talented orator who nonetheless lost his first two election campaigns, Grant sat in the House of Commons from 1955 to 1962. Throughout that period he was a Law Officer: first Solicitor General for Scotland, then Lord Advocate.\n\nHe left Parliament in 1962 to become Lord Justice Clerk, the second most senior judge in Scotland. His work included chairing the eponymous Grant Committee, a major inquiry into the working of Scotland's sheriff courts.\n\nWhile still in office, Grant died in a traffic collision in the Scottish Highlands, with alcohol in his blood. The crash left two other men dead and a young family seriously injured.\n\nGrant was born on 19 June 1909 in Dufftown, Banff,\nthe son of Edward Grant. His mother was a former Miss Kennedy, who Edward had married in 1908.\nHis grandfather William Grant (1839–1923) was the founder of the distillers William Grant & Sons,\nproducers of Glenfiddich whisky.\n\nEdward had been a solicitor for the Caledonian Railway in Glasgow, before returning to Dufftown to work for the family's Balvenie distillery. He died in September 1911, aged only 34, when William only two years old.\n\nJanet Roberts, a granddaughter of the distillery founder and therefore presumably Grant's first cousin, was Scotland's oldest person when she died in 2012 at the age of 110.\n\nSchooled at Fettes College in Edinburgh, Grant won a scholarship in classics to Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first-class degree. He then studied law at Edinburgh University, winning an LLB with distinction.\n\nHe was admitted as an advocate on 2 November 1934.\nAs an officer of the Territorial Army, he was mobilised at the outset of World War II, and served in the Royal Artillery, reaching the rank of major.\nIn 1943 or 1944 he became Deputy Assistant Adjutant General at the War Office.\n\nReturning to the bar after demobilisation in 1945, Grant rebuilt his legal practice, focusing on trusts, wills, inheritance and company law. In 1949 he became standing junior counsel to the Ministry of Pensions in Scotland. With a reputation for fast work and effective presentation, he took silk in 1951.\n\nHe lectured in law at Edinburgh University, and from 1950 to 1954 he chaired the National Health Service Tribunal for Scotland. In the same period, he was also a senior advocate depute (i.e. a prosecutor).\n\nIn the early 1950s, Grant was twice an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for the Labour-held constituency of Edinburgh East. At the 1951 general election, aided by the lack of a Liberal Party candidate, he reduced the majority of the sitting Member of Parliament (MP) and current Lord Advocate, John Wheatley, by nearly half. However at the by-election in April 1954 after Wheatley became a judge, Labour increased its majority to over 5,000, reversing a swing to the government in the previous six by-elections that year.\n\nStill without a parliamentary seat, Grant was appointed in January 1955 as Solicitor General for Scotland. He succeeded William Rankine Milligan who had been promoted to Lord Advocate to replace James Latham Clyde, who had been raised to the bench as a Senator of the College of Justice in the place of Lord Cooper.\n\nHe took office as Milligan's deputy in the last months of Winston Churchill's premiership. Grant was later selected as the Unionists' prospective parliamentary candidate for the Unionist-held seat of Glasgow Woodside. At the general election in May 1955, Grant's oratory drew over a thousand people to his eve-of-poll rally on 25 May in Hillhead, with hundreds more turned away. Two girls fainted in the excitement, which the \"Glasgow Herald\" newspaper suggested set \"a minor record for 1955 political meetings\".\nHe held the seat \nfor the Unionists, with an increased majority, assisted by favourable boundary changes.\n\nGrant and Milligan were retained in office both in the 1955–57 government of Churchill's successor, Anthony Eden,\nand in the post-1957 government of Harold Macmillan. Grant became a privy counsellor in the Queens's 1958 Birthday Honours.\n\nAt the general election in October 1959, Grant was re-elected in Glasgow Woodside. When Milligan was appointed as a judge in 1960, Grant was promoted to fill the vacancy as Lord Advocate.\n\nHis successor as Solicitor General, David Anderson, was not an MP. This left Grant as the government's only spokesperson in the Commons on Scottish legal matters.\n\nAs Lord Advocate, Grant held ultimate authority to decide whether any prosecution should proceed. One of the cases which he declined to bring was a charge of obscenity against the publishers of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\", following the unsuccessful prosecution in England. In November 1960, Grant announced in the Commons that the book was \"tedious\" and that he would not prosecute. The Labour MP Emrys Hughes congratulated Grant for his \"extreme common sense\", and a subsequent High Court challenge to his decision failed.\n\nHowever, Grant was no liberal. In Winnipeg in 1961, he opposed recent British moves to restrict capital punishment, describing them as mistaken and a threat to public safety.\n\nIn 1962, Grant led the defence in the Scottish courts of a claim for about £60 million (£ in 2020) in damages by the Glasgow-based Burmah Oil Company against the government of the United Kingdom. During the Japanese conquest of Burma in 1941 and 1942, the company's assets in Rangoon had been destroyed under a \"scorched earth\" policy by retreating British forces.\nHaving been advised in the late 1940s to sue the government of Burma, the company's company's 12 years of litigation had failed to establish liability against Burma.\nThe trial judge, Lord Kilbrandon, ruled in favour of the oil company. His judgment was overturned by the First Division of the Inner House of the Court of Session, which was in turn overruled by the law lords in \"Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate\". Burmah Oil's legal victory was retrospectively nullified by the War Damage Act 1965.\n\nAfter the death in April 1962 of the Lord Justice Clerk, George Thomson, it was expected that the government would follow the usual practice of appointing the Lord Advocate to the judicial vacancy.\nThe decision was in fact usually made by the Lord Advocate, who traditionally appointed himself,\nwith a substantial rise in salary.\n(In 1967, then Lord Advocate Gordon Stott was elevated to the judiciary, and later joked \"I appointed myself, and a jolly good judge I turned out to be\").\n\nHowever, after the office had been vacant for more than three months, the Labour MP James Hoy raised the issue at Prime Minister's Questions on 31 July, suggesting that the delay was due to government fears of losing a by-election. (At the 1959 election, Grant had a majority of only 2,084 in his Woodside constituency, down from 4,303 in 1955. Woodside was by then considered a marginal seat.).\n\nPrime Minister Harold Macmillan declined a challenge from opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell to explain the reasons for the delay, but promised that a new Justice Clerk would be in place before the Scottish courts resumed on 2 October.\nOn 25 September, a week before the courts opened, Grant was raised to the bench with the judicial title Lord Grant. The Glasgow Woodside by-election was held on 22 November. As expected, it was won by the Labour candidate Neil Carmichael.\n\nAs a judge, Grant gravitated towards criminal cases. He also undertook a lot of the court's administrative duties.\n\nIn 1963, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Noble appointed Grant as chairman of a committee of inquiry into Scotland's sheriff courts. The committee included David Brand QC, several solicitors, and others.\n\nThe Committee on the Sheriff Court, known as the Grant Committee, reported in July 1967, recommending a major reorganisation of the courts to end the long delays in criminal cases. Its recommendations included an increase in the number of full-time sheriffs, the abolition of juries in civil cases in the sheriff courts, increasing the maximum sentence imposed by sheriffs from two years to three, and broadening the recruitment base for sheriffs to include solicitors and academic lawyers.\n\nThe report led to the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971.\n\nGrant was the first chairman of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society as well as a director of Scottish Opera.\n\nIn 1934, Grant became engaged to Margaret Katharine Milne, a native of Aberdeen. They married in 1936,\nand lived in Moray Place in the New Town of Edinburgh.\n\nThe couple had two sons and a daughter, and a reputation for generous hospitality.\n\nLord Grant died on 19 November 1972 as a result of a road accident near Lynchat, about 3 miles north of Kingussie in Inverness-shire. He was 63 years old.\n\nDriving home alone from Brora in Sutherland, his BMW\nhad overtaken a car transporter on a double bend, and collided with a car traveling in the opposite direction, carrying a young family home to Alness. The crash killed the driver of the other car, and seriously injured his wife and their three children, aged between three and seven years. All four survivors were taken to hospital in Inverness. A male passenger in their car was killed along with the driver.\n\nThe fatal accident inquiry in May 1973 heard that blood tests showed Lord Grant to have consumed the equivalent of two pints of beer or two large whiskies. No alcohol was found in the blood of the other driver.\n\nThe injured widow testified that her husband had been driving at under . The Inverness Constabulary estimated the impact speed to have been between and .\n"}

{"id": "2232012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232012", "title": "Moldovans", "text": "Moldovans\n\nMoldovans or Moldavians (, ; Moldovan Cyrillic: Молдовень) are the largest ethnic group of the Republic of Moldova (75.1% of the population, as of 2014), and a significant minority in Ukraine and Russia. Under the variant Moldavians, the term may also be used to refer to all inhabitants of the territory of historical Principality of Moldavia, currently divided among Romania (47.5%), Moldova (30.5%) and Ukraine (22%), regardless of ethnic identity.\n\nThis article refers to the Moldovan/Romanian language-speaking population native to the Republic of Moldova, the historical Bessarabia and diaspora originating from these regions, self-identified as Moldovans (in Moldova, another 7% of the Moldovan/Romanian language-speaking native population self-identified as Romanians).\n\nAccording to Miron Costin, a prominent chronicler from the 17th century Moldavia, the inhabitants of the Principality of Moldavia spoke Romanian and called themselves \"Moldovans\", but also \"Romanians\" which, he notes, comes from \"romanus\". Also, the Slavic neighbours called Moldovans \"Vlachs\" or \"Volokhs\", a term equally used to refer to all native Romance speakers from Eastern Europe and the Balkan peninsula.\n\nAs the ethnonym \"Romanian\" was gaining more and more popularity throughout Western Moldavia and Bukovina during the 19th century, its dissemination in Bessarabia, a more backward and rural province of the Russian Empire at the time, was welcomed mostly by the Romanian-oriented intellectuals, while the majority of the rural population continued to use the old self-identification \"Moldovans\".\n\nUntil the 1920s, historians generally considered Moldovans as a subgroup of the Romanian ethnos. After 1924, within the newly created Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet authorities supported the creation of a different standardized language (see Moldovan language) allegedly in order to prove that Moldovans form a separate ethnic group.\n\nIn the past, the term \"Moldovan\" has been used to refer to the population of the historical Principality of Moldavia. However, for the inhabitants of Bessarabia living under the Russian rule, the term gained an ethnic connotation by the beginning of the 20th century: in May 1917, at a congress of Bessarabian teachers, a dispute arose over the identification of the native population; a group protested against being called \"Romanians\", affirming they were \"Moldovan\", while another group, led by poet Alexei Mateevici, supported the view that the Moldovans are also Romanians.\n\nIn 1918, Bessarabia joined the Kingdom of Romania, following a vote of Sfatul Țării. The circumstance of the vote was itself complex, since the Romanian troops were present in Bessarabia at the request of the Sfatul Țării as it was facing exterior threats and anarchy.\n\nBy the time of the union, the largely illiterate Romanian-speaking peasants of Bessarabia did not consider themselves part of a larger Romanian nation, and there was no mass nationalist movement as in other regions, such as in Transylvania.\n\nThe unified Romanian state promoted a common identity for all its Romanian-speaking inhabitants. Owing partly to its relative underdevelopment compared to other regions of Greater Romania, as well as to the low competence and corruption of the new Romanian administration in this province, the integration process of Bessarabia in the unified Romanian state was less successful than in other regions and was soon to be disrupted by the Soviet occupation.\n\nIn 1940, during World War II, Romania agreed to an ultimatum and ceded the region to the Soviet Union, which organized it into the Moldavian SSR. The Soviets began a campaign to strengthen the Moldovan identity different from that of the rest of Romanian speakers, taking advantage of the incomplete integration of the Bessarabia into the interwar Romania (see also Moldovenism). The official Soviet policy also stated that Romanian and Moldovan were two different languages and, to emphasize this distinction, Moldovan had to be written in a new Cyrillic alphabet (the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet) based on the Russian Cyrillic, rather than the older Romanian Cyrillic that ceased to be used in the 19th century in the Romanian Old Kingdom and 1917 in Bessarabia.\n\nA poll conducted in the Republic of Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a detailed picture. The respondents were asked to rate the relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll showed that 26% of the entire sample, which included all ethnic groups, claimed the two identities were the same or very similar, whereas 47% claimed they were different or entirely different.\n\nThe results varied significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, while 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar and 44% different or very different, among the senior respondents (aged over 60) the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. The proportion of those who chose the same or very similar identity was higher than the average among the native speakers of Romanian/Moldovan (30%), among the urban dwellers (30%), among those with higher education (36%), and among the residents of the capital city (42%).\n\nAccording to a study conducted in the Republic of Moldova in May 1998, when the self-declared Moldovans were asked to relate the Romanian and Moldovan identities, 55% considered them somewhat different, 26% very different and less than 5% identical.\n\nA survey carried out in the Republic of Moldova in 1992 showed that 87% of the Romanian/Moldovan speakers chose to identify themselves as \"Moldovans\", rather than \"Romanians\".\n\nThe major Moldovan political forces have diverging opinions regarding the identity of Moldovans. This contradiction is reflected in their stance towards the national history that should be taught in schools. Governing forces such as the Liberal Party, Liberal Democratic Party, and Our Moldova Alliance support the teaching of the history of Romanians. Others, such as the Democratic Party and the Party of Communists support the history of the Republic of Moldova.\n\nThe diverging opinions are also reflected in the official state documents issued in successive legislatures. The Declaration of Independence of 1991 calls the official language \"Romanian\", and the first anthem adopted by the independent Republic of Moldova was \"Deşteaptă-te, române\" (\"Awaken thee, Romanian!\"), the same as the anthem of Romania.\n\nMirroring different political configurations of the later Moldovan Parliament, the Constitution of Moldova (1994) calls the official language \"Moldovan\", while the \"Concept of the National Policy of the Republic of Moldova\" (2003) adopted by the Communist-dominated Parliament distinguishes explicitly Moldovans and Romanians as ethnic groups, and so does the census of 2004.\n\nOn December 5, 2013, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova ruled that the Romanian language is the official language of this country, in agreement with the Declaration of Independence of 1991.\n\nA significant number of intellectuals from the Bessarabia considered themselves part of the Romanian nation in the passing of time. Amongst these prominent figures, there are the following ones:\n\n\nThe resolution of the \"Association of Historians from the Republic of Moldova\" (AIRM) from October 28, 2009 in favor of teaching the history of Romanians in Moldovan schools reads \"The people of the Moldovan SSR were subjected to the Communist ideology, with the aim of replacing the Romanian identity of the native population, with one newly created\"\n\nThe welcome message of the Union of Writers from Moldova is a quote from Mircea Eliade: \"We invite you to become initiated in the literary life of Bessarabia, border Romanian land subjected to a long, too long terror of history\"\n\nThe national poet of Moldova and Romania, Mihai Eminescu was born and lived outside of the territory of the current Republic of Moldova and considered himself Romanian. He is often quoted as saying \"\"We are Romanians, period. (Suntem români şi punct)\"\".\n\nThe 2014 census reported an estimated 2,998,235 people (without Transnistria), out of which 2,804,801 were actually covered by the census. Among them, 2,068,068 or 73.7% declared themselves Moldovans and 192,800 or 6.9% Romanians.\n. Some organisations like the Liberal party of Moldova have criticised the census results, claiming Romanians comprise 85% of the population and that census officials have pressured respondents to declare themselves Moldovans instead of Romanians and have purposefully failed to cover urban respondents who are more likely to declare themselves Romanians as opposed to Moldovans.\n\nThe previous 2004 census results reported that out of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova (without Transnistria), 2,564,849 or 75.81% declared themselves Moldovans and only 73, 276 or 2.17% Romanians. A group of international observers considered the census was generally conducted in a professional manner, although they reported several cases when enumerators encouraged respondents to declare themselves Moldovans rather than Romanians.\nThe 2001 census in Ukraine counted 258,600 Moldovans and 150,989 Romanians. The self-identified Moldovans live mostly in the southern and northern areas of historical Bessarabia (specifically in the Budjak region of the Odessa oblast and in the Novoselytskyi Raion of Chernivtsi oblast), whereas the self-identified Romanians live mostly in Northern Bukovina and Hertza region of the Chernivtsi oblast.\n\nIn Russia, 156,400 Moldovans have been counted in the 2010 Russian census. They are concentrated mostly in Moscow, but also in some rural areas in Kuban, southern Siberia, and the Russian Far East, where they were deported generations ago. Around 14,000 Moldovans live in Kazakhstan, mostly in the former capital Almaty, but also in some rural areas in the northern parts of the country (another destination of Soviet deportations).\n\nThe largest share (47.5%) of the territory of the historical Principality of Moldavia together with all its formal capitals (Târgul Moldovei, Suceava, and Iaşi) and the famous painted churches are located in Romania. The river Moldova (possibly, the origin of the name of the Principality, see \"Etymology of Moldova\") now flows entirely through Romania. After the Russian annexation of Bessarabia in 1812, and Austrian annexation of Bukovina in 1775, the rest of Moldova united with Wallachia and formed the modern Romania.\n\nIn 1998, Constantin Simirad, the former mayor of Iaşi founded the Party of the Moldavians \"(Partidul Moldovenilor)\" which later joined the Social Democratic Party. However, the party's declared objective was to represent the interests of the Moldavia region in Romania rather than any ethnic identification.\n\nAccording to the Romanian census of 2002, there are 4.7 million Romanian speakers in the eight counties that were once part of the Principality of Moldavia. The number of people, if any, who possibly declared themselves as Moldovans in this census is impossible to know, since \"Moldovan\" is officially considered a regional identity in Romania. The Romanian-speaking inhabitants of these counties generally refer to themselves as \"Moldavians\", but declare Romanian ethnicity.\n\nIn February 2007, a small group of Romanian citizens who created the \"Moldovan/Moldavian Community in Romania\" (Comunitatea moldovenilor din România) attempted unsuccessfully to gain recognition of the minority status for Moldovans from Romania. The organization was initially registered legally, but the decision was soon reverted. Around the same time, during a visit to Moldova, three delegates met with President Vladimir Voronin, who promised them his support. Being denied legal recognition the Community eventually dissolved.\n\nIn Romania, the Moldovans from Bessarabia region (contemporary Republic of Moldova included) are usually called Bessarabians \"(basarabeni)\" in order to distinguish them from the inhabitants of Eastern Romania.\n\nThe major denomination in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The majority of Moldovan Orthodox Christians belong to the Moldovan Orthodox Church, a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church, while a minority belongs to the Metropolis of Bessarabia, a branch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Both bodies are in full communion, the dispute between them being purely territorial and revolves around the legitimate succession of the interwar Metropolitan See of Bessarabia. As of 2007, the Moldovan Orthodox Church has 1255 parishes, while the Metropolis of Bessarabia has 219.\n\n\n"}

In 2009, it has become an 'Academy for Gifted Students' selected by the Ministry of Education of Korea. Now, it is one of the eight such academies in Republic of Korea.\n\nThe school is famous for its rigorous selection process in the search for the most gifted students among the top middle school graduate applicants from all over the nation. \nBefore the transition, there were about 180 students in each grade. The general program was a three-year course, but an early graduation program existed. About one-third of sophomore students graduated one year earlier than the typical high school students in Korea. After the transition to an 'Academy for Gifted Students', the number of the students admitted each year was reduced to approximately 125, and the curriculum was modified to fulfill the need and curiosity of students better. The new curriculum includes the following:\n\nThe school was switched from a 'Science High School' to an 'Academy for Gifted Students' according to the procedures set out in Enforcement Decree of the Gifted Education Promotion Law Act Article 19.

Also, the student must fulfill at least 240 hours on special activities: 120 hours on group activity, and 120 hours of volunteer work. The university-level courses are accepted as Advanced Placement credit at KAIST, POSTECH, UNIST, GIST, and DGIST.\n\nThe school is famous for many national and international Science Olympiad participants and medal winners. Usually, a quarter to a half of the Korean participants in the International Science Olympiads is from Seoul Science High School for Gifted Students.\n\nGraduates from this school typically enter Seoul National University, KAIST, and POSTECH. Some students enroll to colleges abroad such as MIT, Caltech, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard, and Cornell. Many alumni have undertaken graduate studies at top institutions in Korea, U.S., and Europe after earning their bachelor's degrees.\n\nThe school motto is \"Intelligence and Righteous Action\" (예지의행, 叡智義行).\n\nMost of the students at Seoul Science High School are male.\n\nThe main purpose of this building is as a dormitory. Students use this building after 11 pm when they finish their study in Yeji building. Boys use 3rd ~ 5th floor, and girls use 2nd floor. Usually, 2nd graders use the 3rd and 4th floor, and 1st graders use the 5th floor. There is a terrace beside the 5th floor, and there is a path through the new building for 3rd graders who have none or less penalty points than others. The 2nd floor is for cafeteria and girl's dormitory, but it is also used for people who control and take care of students using dormitory. Students should turn off all the lights by 1:00 am and they are supposed to wake up in 7:00 am. Sometimes students who did not wake up at 7:00 am get penalty points.\n\nThe Yeji building is the main building of Seoul Science High school. It is placed in the center of the school, and is a four-story building. The building is named after the school motto, \"Yeji\" which means \"manners and wisdom\". The first floor is mostly occupied with departments for the management of the school such as the administration office, and the principal's office. There are also valuable scientific instruments such as the Wind Tunnel and 3D printer, and classroom about invention at the first floor. The second floor is for Earth science; it has laboratories and lecture rooms. It also has a study hall which connects the Yeji building to the library and the Fusion talent building. The study hall allows the students to do their work in their free time and the study hours after school. There is also a small classroom where students can use their laptops for researching and making presentations. The third floor has a gym and lecture rooms, laboratories for physics. There are instruments such as the high-speed camera and the forward-looking infrared. There are laboratories and lecture rooms for biology and room for SEM on the fourth floor. The biology laboratory is full of scientific instruments. There is an observatory on the rooftop which the largest telescope in Seoul. There are three telescopes for taking pictures of the large-scale structures of the cosmos and a planetarium bought in the 1990s.\n\n1st floor\n\nWind Tunnel Room, Workshop, Aviation Science Room, Document Room, Small Conference Room, Big Conference Room, Fusion Science Laboratory, Invention Teacher's Room, Broadcasting Room, Education room for Gifted student, 2nd grade students' room for Between Classes, Administration Office, Ancillary Room, Principal's Office, Nurse's office\n\n2nd floor\n\nEarth Science Laboratory 1, Earth Science Laboratory 2, Earth Science Lecture room 1, Earth Science Lecture room 2, Earth Science Prepare room, Earth Science Teacher's room, 3rd grade students' room for Between Classes, 1st grade students' room for Between Classes, 1st grade's teacher room, Club Room, Advise room for 3rd grade students, 3rd grade's teacher room, Study Hall, Between Classes teacher's room\n\n3rd floor\n\nPhysics cutting-edge instrument room, Physics Laboratory 1, Physics Laboratory 2, Physics Laboratory 3, Physics Lecture Room 1, Physics Lecture Room 2, Physics Prepare room, Physics Office 1, Physics Office 2, Life Safety Office, introspection room, Gymnasium\n\n4th floor\n\nClub Room 1,Club Room 2, Biology Laboratory 1, Biology Laboratory 2, Biology Laboratory 3, Biology Lecture Room 1, Biology Lecture Room 2, Biology Office 1, Biology office 2, SEM room, Seminar room, Biology Prepare room, Gymnasium, specimen room\n\nOnce upon a time, Aram building was a building where people work with wood to fix some defective tables and chairs. Since about 2000 to 2006, it was used as a warehouse. but, since 2006, Aram building had been Abandoned architecture for 10 years. But, it remodeled to a sports building in September, 2016 and deserved a name, Aram. The building's name, Aram, comes from a name of a school newspaper-pubulishing regular club, Hanaram. It is a remote building, even more deserted than the Wu-am building. It located on the side of a schoolyard where a recycling bin located. There are six table tennis tables, an indoor driving range, two running machines, a situp bench, and some strength exercising machines and bathroom which was also remodeled. There is also a personal indoor driving range separated to the indoor driving range used by students. The personal indoor driving range is usually used by P.E teacher. There is a parking lot on the rooftop. P.E classes are usually held in the building. They learn how to play golf and play table tennis in the classes. There are always a plenty of students playing a table tennis in their free time, including students belong to LA, a table tennis Irregular club.\n\nWu-am building is a four-story building. Wu-am is a pen name of Si-yeol Song, a famous civil minister of The Kingdom of Joseon. In front of the building, there is a famous rock named Thousand Years Rock. There is Chinese characters carved by Si-yeol Song on the rock. The rock is also a symbol of the school. There are also Statue of Jang Yeong-sil and a statue named 'a Site of Creation' in front of the building. Jang Yeoung-sil is a famous inventor of The Kingdom of Joseon who invented Joseon's first rain gauge. Wu-am building is a remote building. It is located on the hill and also far from Uihaeng building and Yeji building, the main buildings of the school. But, there are several important classrooms such as Korean classrooms, math classrooms, and social studies classrooms in the building. This path also has a cover that protect students from rain on it. In the first floor of the building, there are audiovisual room and a multipurpose classroom. In the second floor, there are some multipurpose classrooms and a teachers' rooms. One of the teachers' rooms in the second floor of Wu-am building is a biggest teachers' room in the school. Also, there is a big stairway that we can use to go second floor directly from outside of the building. In the third floor, there are math lecture rooms and an office for math teachers. In the forth floor, there are Korean lecture rooms and social studies lecture rooms and some multipurpose classrooms and an office for social studies teachers and Korean teachers. The building has two stairs, one on the left side and the other on the right side. In addition, on the center of the building, there is a bathroom.\n\nFusion talent building is a building which is located right in front of the school gate. Instead of first floor, it is connected with Uihaeng building. This building has an elevator. On the first floor, there is a teachers' room and music room, and there is an English room and library on the second floor. For the case of advise room, it is very free that many students use the advise room. The library is connected with Yeji building and study hall. Above the third floor, there is a guest room which is used for visitors for other schools. On the 4th and 5th floors, there is a male dormitory and is called a new dormitory. They have to pass through Uihaeng building to go to their dormitory because they have to do attendance check in 2nd floor of Uihaeng Building. So they cannot use elevator or stairs in that building to go to their dormitory except on Monday morning and Friday afternoon.\n\n5th floor\n\nmale dormitory for 3rd graders\n\n4th floor\n\nmale dormitory for 3rd graders\n\n3rd floor\n\nGuest House, Fusion Common classroom 2, Fusion Common classroom 3, Fusion Common classroom 4, Fusion Common classroom 5\n\n2nd floor\n\nAdvise room, Foreign language Lecture room 1, Foreign language Lecture Room 2, Foreign language Lecture Room 3, Foreign language Lecture Room 4, Foreign language Lecture Room 5, Foreign language Lecture Room 6, Foreign language Office, Foreign language reference room, English Communication room\n\n1st floor\n\nConnection room, Music Office, Music Lecture Room, Parent's waiting room, Facilities Management Office, Guard's room, Music play room, Fusion Common classroom 1, 3rd students' teachers room, College Counseling Office\n\nIt is next to the school yard. Because the schoolyard is in a low place, this building is also very low. Because of this building, the school yard became smaller. It also has an elevator as well as Fusion talent building. In the first floor we have a lecture room and computer room for information class, and It has chemistry lecture room and laboratories on the second and third floors. There is a big auditorium which has 300 seats.\n\n4th floor\n\nAuditorium\n\n3rd floor\n\nChemistry laboratory 1, Chemistry Office 2, Chemistry laboratory 2, Chemistry Prepare room, Chemistry Reagent room, Chemistry Lecture Room 3\n\n2nd floor\n\nChemistry Lecture Room 1, Chemistry Lecture Room 2, Chemistry Office 1, Chemistry R&E room, Chemistry instruments room, Club Room\n\n1st floor\n\nServer room, Computer Science Office, Computer Laboratory 1, Computer Laboratory 2, Computer Science Prepare room, Computer Science Lecture Room\n\nWake up\n\nA morning wake up song comes out at 6:57 and the students have to go outside of their dormitories and do a roll call. If you're late it is 1 penalty point, and if you don't go out it is 2 penalty points. And if the weather is rainy or bad the roll call is done in the cafeteria. After the roll call you can go back up to your dormitory and get ready for breakfast or get back to sleep. But you have to get out of the dorm before 8:10 or you will get 1 penalty point.\n\nClass and Between Class\n\nFile:Students using room 2.jpg\n\nSSHS Student are using room for between classes during their free time\n\nFile:Students using room 1.jpg\n\nSSHS Student are using room for between classes during their free time\n\nEach of the subjects have their own classrooms, so students have to go to their class during break time and get ready for the next class. It is similar to college. Second and third graders have between classes. In the between classes students can almost do whatever they want with the teachers permission.\n\nFree time\n\nFrom 4:20 to 7:00 students are given free time. 5:30 to 6:40 is supper time. With your prime teacher permission, students can go outside of school. Students have to write the reason for going out. They usually write reasons such as ‘to buy underwear’, ‘because of illness’ etc.\n\nStudy hour\n\nFrom 7:00 to 9:00 it is the first study hour. Students can study at the study hall or use the room for between classes to use their laptops for other assignments. The containable number of people in rooms for the between classes is limited. First graders 30, second and third graders 40. After the first study hour students are given a thirty-minute break time. They usually go the cafeteria to get their snacks. From 9:30 to 11:00 there is a second study hour. Students have to vitally study at the study hall. They come out of the study hall at about 10:45 because the study hall door closes at 11:00 sharp.\n\nNight life\n\nAfter going into the dormitory there is no more roll call. Students can act freely. However they can't take laptops, food, cards, or board games. After 12 o' clock students can't stay at other students dormitories. After 1 they have to turn lights off. If you get caught being in another dormitory or if you don't turn off the lights you will get 1 penalty point. Also if you get caught bringing a laptop, you will get 5 penalty points. Students who want to study can use a portable light stand or go to the lobby where you can study freely. Also, the cafeteria is open until 1 o' clock for students who need to use the laptop.\n\nA large portion of SSHS students studies math or science olympiads. The majority of students prepare for Math and Physics Olympiads, but there are a few students who prepare for other Olympiads such as Chemistry or Biology.\n\nMany students start studying Olympiads with MO, so SSHS students are good in math. There are 6 members of the national team in MO, and 5~6 students are always from SSHS. Approximately Half of the members are in third grade, and the rest of the members are in second grade or occasionally in first grade, too. About 60 students get a gold medal in IMO, and 2~5 students in SSHS get a gold medal every year. Especially, in 2017, six members of the national representatives were all SSHS, and all received a gold medal.\n\nPhO is normally the most popular Olympiad in SSHS, mostly because its problems are directly related to what they learn in school. The people who get the best scores in Korean Pho becomes the Korean representatives. The Korean representative team normally consists of one first grader and four second graders. For the past 10 years, at least half of the Korean representatives are from SSHS.\n\nChemistry Olympiad is separated in First grade class and Second grade class. It is hard to be a member of the national team in second grade because the gap of level of knowledge is big between grades. Chemistry Olympiad has Summer school and Winter school. Students study General chemistry in First grade class Summer school, and Organic chemistry in First grade class Winter school. Students study intensive course of General chemistry in Second grade class. MO and PO are more popular than Chemistry Olympiad, but still 3 out of the 4 members of the IChO national team are students of the SSHS.\n\nIOI is an annual competitive programming competition for secondary school students. It is the second largest Olympiad, after International Mathematical Olympiad, in terms of the number of participating countries. However, in comparison to the size of the contest, the number of SSHS students who prepare IOI is small in comparison to other Olympiads. Most of these students are third graders. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, but the most known reason is that the support of the school is weak. Gyeonggi Science High School supports the students much better for the Olympiad in Informatics. Despite the lack of support, in 2018, the national team includes two students from each school; Seoul Gyeonggi Science High.\n\nThere are many other olympiads such as Biology Olympiad, or Brain Science Olympiad, but there are not as many students who prepare for these contests.\n\nRegular club\n\nEach person can go in only one regular club, which means each regular club has about 5–7 people each. Depending on the popularity, which is determined by the result of the prior survey, clubs are divided into three groups: Ga group, Na group, and Da group. Da group is the most popular group. Regular club selection is done over three days; \\Ga group on the first day, Na group on the second day, Da group on the third.

An annual booklet called 'Quanta Story' is published by Quantas, which includes problems and solutions made by Quantas members. Most of the Quantas members study the physics Olympiads, and the consist a large portion in the IPhO national team.\n\n(xvi) Trouble maker\n\nTrouble maker is an invention club. The members of \"trouble maker\" are in charge of the management of the 3D printer, and 3D printer education.\n\n(xvii) SciCom\n\nAbout once or two times a year, they make a contest called \"SCIOI\" in a similar form with the international Information Olympiad(IOI). Also, the members make a team together and participate in external contests.\n\n(xvii) MO\n\nMO is a mathematics study club. An annual booklet called 'SemSarang' is published by MO, which includes problems and solutions made by MO members. Most of the MO members study the mathematics Olympiad, and they consist a large portion of the IMO national team.\n\n(xix)Black Hole\n\nBlack Hole is an astronomical observation club. The members of 'Black Hole' have the privilege to use the school observatory freely. They normally go on a trip to other observatories once or twice a year, for two days.\n\n(xx)Eureka\n\nEureka is a club that writes English articles. However, it also does mathematical activities, too. The entrance exam of Eureka also includes mathematical problems.\n\nIrregular Club\n\nThere is no limit in the number of irregular clubs one can join. Irregular clubs can be divided into three big fields: Sports club, scholarly clubs, performance clubs. The selection of new club members are done normally 4 times (each semester in first and second grade), by the test made by 11th graders.\n\nSports Clubs : SD(soccer club), TP(basketball club), LA(ping-pong club), PS(badminton club), PG(baseball club), Morning soccer club\n\nScholarly clubs : Science discussion club, MAGnolia (Life science mentoring club), M&J (Math Magazine research club), CALGeN (Mathematics Mentoring club), Aerospace (Aviation membership club), Chela (chemistry mentoring club), MWT(computer science mentoring club), LTE(Long term experiment-SSHS Mechatronics, Artificial Neutral Network, HABE), Star#(physics mentoring club), SMS(mathematics problem research club), SEM(Economics study club), VIPS(patent club)\n\nPerformance clubs :M(Magic club), Ocarina(Ocarina club), Caritas (Orchestra club), Livian(Ballad club), MIC(Hip-Hop club), Ssangdre(Band Club), Our sound(Korean traditional Music club), Klavier (piano club), You Can(boy dance club), Depression (abbv. Deep, Girl-Dressed Boy dance club), LSD(Launch Pad Club)\n\nOthers : milalhoe (Christian club), WYW(What You Want, design club), Shadows (cartoon drawing club), Letters(Literature club), TNT(composition and rhythm game club), board Game club (BGM), Manifold(Origami Club)\n\nAll classes and assessments at the school are operated on a credit system and you can choose the course you want, like universities and other gifted schools. But if there's a difference, all subjects are absolute assessments. That is, if the score is 90 or more, A + is given. If the score is 85 or more, and less than 90, A0 is given. If the score is 80 or more, and less than 85 A- is given. Since then, grades have been divided into 5 points. In addition, all the arts and physical education semesters are pass/fail system, and receive a pass if the score exceeds 60 out of 100 points.\n\nIf the grade of any subject is less than B0 or Fail, you can apply for re-entry. You can apply for a maximum of four times per student per class and up to B+ per class if you retake classes.\n\nBasically, all courses are divided into three categories: required courses with scheduled classes, required courses to choose when classes are taken, and elective courses.\n\nApplications are accepted every June and November. Unlike college, this school receives a course enrollment and then schedules a timetable according to the number of students. A minimum of 10 credits and a maximum of 29 credits are allowed per semester. If the number of applicants for any subject is less than seven, the subject is discarded. Also one class enter up to 20 people. There is also a hierarchy between subjects. For example, to apply for Advanced Chemistry I, you must have already completed Chemistry I, II, and III.\n\nSince students do not enroll in the first grade, the credit is fixed (first semester 30 credits, second semester 29 credits). In the second year, there will be individual differences but generally most of students get 25–29 credits per semester. In the third grade, the individual differences become worse. Usually, about 40 credits are allocated to the first and second semesters. There are about 6–15 hours between classes. However, the level of difficulty of the subject greatly increases and also they live in the burden of entrance examination.\n\n1. Entrance test of Seoul Science High School\n\nIn the Republic of Korea, it is illegal for standard high schools to have their own entrance test. However, Seoul Science High School belongs to the special law for education, “Act on the Promotion of Specific Education for Brilliant Children”, which allows it to have the right to examine the candidates. The entrance test of SSHS can be divided into three parts. \nThe first step is evaluation of student record. Teachers of SSHS get to read applicants’ student record and letters of self-introduction. Then, they judge whether the applicants are eager for studying science and have enough giftedness. \nThe applicants who pass this step are allowed to take the second step, which is examination. In this step, the students need to take exams for three period in order to prove that they are smart enough to enter the school. In the first period, the exam is used for examining students’ ability in various aspects. During the second and third period, students are rated for their specialties in math and science. The students who show very decent talents are specially allowed to enter this school without taking third exam, and this system is called prior selection. \nFor the last, the students who passed second exam are required to take the last exam, which is taken in a form of camp. During this camp, students interview, work in teams to solve their tasks, or plan and carry out experiment on their own. After all of these steps, about 120 students are able to enter the Seoul Science High School.\n\n2. The transition of trends in entrance test\n\nSince entrance test have been had its effect, its difficulty has been increased steadily. And, the style of test problems are slowly turning into types that requires people for their creativeness. And also, there was a big change in systems of this entrance test just a year ago. The major change was held in the second test, exam. In the past, students whoever shows special quality in their studying ability was selected priorly. But, it has been changed into rules that only one student per states was allowed to be selected through this system. It seems to be in purpose of giving students from countrysides more chance of getting favored by this system. Also, the third step which is scientific camp has slightly changed in its program. They had eliminated interview about applicants’ ability of solving problems, and instead they added some kind of creativity test or activities that can evaluate their abilities of teamwork.\n\nIt is a festival of Seoul Science High School and is held for two days in the middle of December every year. Every student enjoys the festival because it's held after the final exams, task research, R&E, and college entrance examinations all ended. Most regular clubs organize their own booths, and some clubs replace their booths by producing editions or newspapers. Lots of performance clubs such as Between Act and Scene, Deep, Ssangdre, Livian, Our Voice, MIC, and M performs at the festival.\n\nThe festival theme is selected each year through a student idea contest, and posters for festival are selected through the contests too. Most posters are produced by WYW, the design club.\n\nThousand Years Rock is the website of alumni society of Seoul Science High School that all junior students are encouraged to join. The occasional questions about studying abroad, college counseling and textbooks are mostly posted on the site. Birthday and anniversary celebrations, obituaries, and job postings also come up.\n\nSeoul Science High School's enrolled students mostly communicate with Facebook. Student council uses Facebook pages to inform students about school occasions. On “SSHS student council notice” page, information like special lectures, happiness enhancement programs, buying school jumper, gathering opinions and informing changes of school rules, encouraging to join circles etc. are posted. On “SSHS bamboo forest” page, students post their unconstrained thoughts and opinions anonymously. On “SSHS Lost & Found Center” page, students post things they lost and where they've lost it. They also post things they found. There exist pages for each grade and the pages that former grades lead their juniors. The chairpersons of regular and irregular clubs introduce their club on the page and irregular clubs gather participants for their club too. There are lots of pages of clubs, which they post their works. For example, “SSHS broadcasting club SBS” page posts weekly rising songs, “SSHS newspaper club Hanaram” page posts their articles, “SSHS Livian” page posts videos of their songs, and “SSHS literary creation club Letters” posts their poems or writings. Students also autonomously make some pages that posts information related to Seoul Science High School students, such as the “DongsPatch” page, which post them in forms of internet news article. There are also pages related to social problem such as racisms, feminisms, etc. Some make pages that posts mathematical or scientific facts or problems, such as “Team Wooden Compass” page that posts daily mathematical problems. There also exists many pages for promoting friendship. There are pages such that posts pictures of their friends.\n\n\n\n"}

The story revolves around the relationship between two men who travel from California, aiming to start a business in Pittsburgh.\n\nAt the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, it tied for the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, the highest honor. While a box office bomb in its own country, it later gained cult status.\n\nTwo vagabonds, Max Millan, a short-tempered ex-convict, and Francis Lionel \"Lion\" Delbuchi, a childlike ex-sailor, meet on the road in California and agree to become partners in a car wash business, once they reach Pittsburgh. Lion is on his way to Detroit to see the child he has never met and make amends with his wife Annie, whom he has been sending all the money he made while at sea. Max agrees to make a detour on his way to Pittsburgh, where the bank that Max has been sending all his seed money is located.\n\nWhile visiting Max's sister in Denver, the pair's antics land them in a prison farm for a month. Max blames Lion for their being sent back to jail and shuns him. Lion is befriended by a powerful inmate named Riley, who later tries to sexually assault Lion, and while not succeeding, physically savages and emotionally traumatizes him. Max rekindles his friendship with Lion, and becomes his protector, eventually exacting revenge by beating up Riley. After being released from prison, the two continue to have a profound effect on each other, although they have both undergone personal transformations and their roles have shifted—with Lion still traumatized and no longer carefree and clowning nor able even to laugh or even smile, and Max loosening his high-strung aggression (at one point doing a tongue-in-cheek striptease to defuse a fight at a bar and to attempt to make Lion laugh again).\n\nWhen the duo finally make it to Detroit, Lion finds a payphone and calls Annie, now remarried and raising their five-year-old son. Annie is still furious at Lion for having abandoned her, and lies that she miscarried their son (adding spitefully, knowing Lion is Catholic, \"He never even got born. Never got baptized. You know what that means; his soul can't go to heaven. That's what you did for your son's soul, you bastard. You sent it into limbo. That soul cannot go to heaven\"). Lion is devastated, as is Annie when he hangs up after hearing the \"news.\" When he gets off the phone, he acts overjoyed with Max about having a son. Shortly afterward, Lion has a breakdown while playing in a city park with children and later on becomes catatonic. Max promises Lion, now in a psychiatric hospital, that he will do anything to help him, and boards a train to Pittsburgh with a round-trip ticket.\n\nWarner Bros. approved the project, looking for a small-budget film after executives became less confident in the success of larger projects. Director Jerry Schatzberg's preference for the roles of Max and Lion were Gene Hackman and Al Pacino, and Schatzberg previously had worked with Pacino on \"The Panic in Needle Park\" (1971).\n\nTo understand their characters, Pacino and Hackman costumed themselves and went begging in San Francisco. However, Pacino, an advocate of method acting, found his techniques conflicted with Hackman, who would be silent before shooting while Pacino paced. Although Hackman had fun with the production, Pacino later commented, \"It wasn't the easiest working with Hackman, who I love as an actor\".\n\nAt the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, the film won the equivalent of the Palme d'Or of later years, the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, shared with \"The Hireling\" directed by Alan Bridges. It also won Best Non-European Film at Denmark's 1974 Bodil Awards. In the U.S., \"Scarecrow\" proved to be a box office bomb.\n\nIn 1973, Roger Ebert gave it three stars, comparing the story to \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"Midnight Cowboy\", and positively reviewed the performances of Pacino and Hackman, the writing and setting.

Peter Biskind, on the other hand, described the film as being of \"secondary\" significance in his book \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\". \"Scarecrow\" has a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews.\n\nBy 2012, \"Scarecrow\" was the best-reviewed film in Schatzberg's career. After gaining a cult following, Schatzberg had Seth Cohen write a sequel, with a screenplay completed by 2013. It would be set years later, with Max and computer worker Lion reuniting, and Lion learning his son is alive. The film sequel was made difficult, if not impossible, by the studio's lack of support and Hackman's retirement from acting.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2232092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232092", "title": "Lutein", "text": "Lutein\n\nLutein (; from Latin \"luteus\" meaning \"yellow\") is a xanthophyll and one of 600 known naturally occurring carotenoids. Lutein is synthesized only by plants, and like other xanthophylls is found in high quantities in green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale and yellow carrots. In green plants, xanthophylls act to modulate light energy and serve as non-photochemical quenching agents to deal with triplet chlorophyll (an excited form of chlorophyll), which is overproduced at very high light levels, during photosynthesis. See xanthophyll cycle for this topic.\n\nAnimals obtain lutein by ingesting plants. In the human retina, lutein is absorbed from blood specifically into the macula lutea, although its precise role in the body is unknown. Lutein is also found in egg yolks and animal fats.\n\nLutein is isomeric with zeaxanthin, differing only in the placement of one double bond. Lutein and zeaxanthin can be interconverted in the body through an intermediate called \"meso\"-zeaxanthin. The principal natural stereoisomer of lutein is -\"beta\",\"epsilon\"-carotene-3,3′-diol. Lutein is a lipophilic molecule and is generally insoluble in water. The presence of the long chromophore of conjugated double bonds (polyene chain) provides the distinctive light-absorbing properties. The polyene chain is susceptible to oxidative degradation by light or heat and is chemically unstable in acids.\n\nLutein is present in plants as fatty-acid esters, with one or two fatty acids bound to the two hydroxyl-groups. For this reason, saponification (de-esterfication) of lutein esters to yield free lutein may yield lutein in any ratio from 1:1 to 1:2 molar ratio with the saponifying fatty acid.\n\nThis xanthophyll, like its sister compound zeaxanthin, has primarily been used in food and supplement manufacturing as a colorant due to its yellow-red color. Lutein absorbs blue light and therefore appears yellow at low concentrations and orange-red at high concentrations.\n\nMany songbirds (like golden oriole, evening grosbeak, yellow warbler, common yellowthroat and Javan green magpie, but not American goldfinch or yellow canaries) deposit lutein obtained from the diet into growing tissues to color their feathers.\n\nAlthough lutein is concentrated in the macula – a small area of the retina responsible for three-color vision – the precise functional role of retinal lutein has not been determined.\n\nIn 2013, findings of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that a dietary supplement formulation containing lutein reduced progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by 25 percent. However, lutein and zeaxanthin had no overall effect on preventing AMD, but rather \"the participants with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin at the start of the study, but who took an AREDS formulation with lutein and zeaxanthin during the study, were about 25 percent less likely to develop advanced AMD compared with participants with similar dietary intake who did not take lutein and zeaxanthin.\"\n\nIn AREDS2, participants took one of four AREDS formulations: the original AREDS formulation, AREDS formulation with no beta-carotene, AREDS with low zinc, AREDS with no beta-carotene and low zinc. In addition, they took one of four additional supplement or combinations including lutein and zeaxanthin (10 mg and 2 mg), omega-3 fatty acids (1,000 mg), lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids, or placebo. The study reported that there was no overall additional benefit from adding omega-3 fatty acids or lutein and zeaxanthin to the formulation. However, the study did find benefits in two subgroups of participants: those not given beta-carotene, and those who had little lutein and zeaxanthin in their diets. Removing beta-carotene did not curb the formulation's protective effect against developing advanced AMD, which was important given that high doses of beta-carotene had been linked to higher risk of lung cancers in smokers. It was recommended to replace beta-carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin in future formulations for these reasons.\n\n\n\nA more recent study investigated the effects of lutein and zeaxanthin on macular pigment and visual function in patients with early AMD. Daily intake of either 20 mg lutein alone or 10 mg lutein and 10 mg zeaxanthin was found to significantly increase the macular pigment content in comparison with the placebo group; the authors also reported a significant improvement in contrast sensitivity and a trend toward improvement in best-corrected visual acuity after 48 weeks of carotenoid supplementation. Furthermore, they found a significant correlation between these two parameters of visual function and the macular pigment content, suggesting that the increase in the latter underlies the improvement of visual function.\n\nThere is preliminary epidemiological evidence that increasing lutein and zeaxanthin intake lowers the risk of cataract development. Consumption of more than 2.4 mg of lutein/zeaxanthin daily from foods and supplements was significantly correlated with reduced incidence of nuclear lens opacities, as revealed from data collected during a 13- to 15-year period in one study.\n\nTwo meta-analyses confirm a correlation between high diet content or high serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and a decrease in the risk of cataract. There is only one published clinical intervention trial testing for an effect of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on cataracts. The AREDS2 trial enrolled subjects at risk for progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration. Overall, the group getting lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) were NOT less likely to progress to needing cataract surgery. The authors speculated that there may be a cataract prevention benefit for people with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin, but recommended more research.\n\nLutein is a natural part of a human diet found in orange-yellow fruits and flowers, and in leafy vegetables. According to the NHANES 2013-2014 survey, adults in the United States consume on average 1.7 mg/day of lutein and zeaxanthin combined. No recommended dietary allowance currently exists for lutein. Some positive health effects have been seen at dietary intake levels of 6–10 mg/day. The only definitive side effect of excess lutein consumption is bronzing of the skin (carotenodermia).\n\nAs a food additive, lutein has the E number E161b (INS number 161b) and is extracted from the petals of African marigold (\"Tagetes erecta\"). It is approved for use in the EU and Australia and New Zealand In the United States lutein may not be used as a food coloring for foods intended for human consumption, but can be added to animal feed and is allowed as a human dietary supplement often in combination with Zeaxanthin. Example: lutein fed to chickens will show up in skin color and egg yolk color.\n\nSome foods contain relatively high amounts of lutein:\n\nIn humans, the Observed Safe Level (OSL) for lutein, based on a non-government organization evaluation, is 20 mg/day. Although much higher levels have been tested without adverse effects and may also be safe, the data for intakes above the OSL are not sufficient for a confident conclusion of long-term safety. Neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nor the European Food Safety Authority considers lutein an essential nutrient or has acted to set a tolerable upper intake level.\n\nThe lutein market is segmented into pharmaceutical, dietary supplement, food, pet food, and animal and fish feed. The pharmaceutical market for lutein is estimated to be about US$190 million, and the nutraceutical and food categories are estimated to be about US$110 million. Pet food and other animal applications for lutein are estimated at US$175 million annually. This includes chickens (usually in combination with other carotenoids), to get color in egg yolks, and fish farms to color the flesh closer to wild-caught color. In the dietary supplement industry, the major market for lutein is for products with claims of helping maintain eye health. Newer applications are emerging in oral and topical products for skin health. Skin health via orally consumed supplements is one of the fastest growing areas of the US$2 billion carotenoid market.\n\n"}

In American service, the missile was designated the \"AGM-22\". The missile entered service with the French Army in 1956. Production of the SS.11/SS.12 series ceased some time in the 1980s, by which time over 170,000 had been sold. The price of the SS.11 in the late 1960s was stated at approximately $1,900 U.S. dollars.\n\nDevelopment of an improved version of the SS.10 (Nord-5203) began in 1953 as the Nord-5210. The missile was intended as a heavy version of the man-portable SS.10 for use from vehicles, ships and helicopters. The missile entered service with the French army as the designation SS.11. It was used as the first helicopter-mounted anti-tank missile in the world (on Alouette IIs).\n\nFrom 1962, a \"B\" model of the missile was produced, which replaced some of the original electronics with solid state components. The transistorization improved response time and handling, which reduced the tendency to over-correct during flight. This was the version used for the development of an infantry version, in which the operator carried three warheads and had a \"waist belt fire-control,\" and three other men carried the missile minus its warhead.\n\nOne of the most unusual uses of the SS.11 was that of probably the smallest anti-shipping missile in the world, with the Swedish Marines employing it in the anti-landing craft role for decades, until it was replaced by a specialized version of the AGM-114 Hellfire. It was also used by the Finnish coastal artillery for covering narrow channels in the archipelago, being replaced in this role by the Israeli SPIKE ER (Rannikko-Ohjus 06).\n\nThe first combat use of the SS.11 was in 1956 by the French Air Force, fired from a Dassault MD 311 light twin-engine transport, as a method of attacking fortified caves located in steep mountain gorges during the Algerian war. The combat experiment proved extremely successful and became standard on other French Air Force MD 311s stationed in the Algerian war theater. From this early combat experience in Algeria with fixed wing aircraft firing the SS.11, the French Army took note and introduced the world's first specialized combat helicopter firing antitank missiles, based on the Alouette II and later the Alouette III that fired both the earlier surface-to-surface SS.11 and the AS.11 developed for air-to-surface firing from aircraft, both of which saw extensive combat in that conflict from 1958 to 1962.\n\nAfter the cancellation of the SSM-A-23 Dart in 1958, the United States began evaluating the SS.11, and accepted it into service in 1961 as the AGM-22A. The missile was deployed from UH-1B Huey helicopters using either the XM11 or M22 armament subsystems. In U.S. Army service, the SS.11 was used mainly to develop tactics employing antitank helicopters and to train future helicopter crews. In September 1965, 12 U.S. Army UH-1B helicopters belonging to a special unit, fitted with the XM-58 stabilized sight arrived in South Vietnam. One month later, they fired AGM-22s in combat.\n\nDuring the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, the Israeli Army was equipped with a large number of SS.11s supplied by France. SS.11s were used during the battle of Abu-Ageila.\n\nIn 1966, the French Navy did an evaluation of the SS.11(M) and SS.12(M) from the fast patrol boat \"La Combattante\". In 1966, the Libyan Navy ordered three fast patrol boats from Vosper Thornycroft (the \"Sebha\", \"Sirte\" and \"Susa\"). Delivered in 1968, these were the first naval vessels to be armed with the SS.11(M) and AS.12(M) being armed with four on each side of the vessel's bridge; the Libyan fast patrol boats proved that this was a very low-cost way to give long-range heavy firepower to small naval vessels. Other navies soon followed Libya and bought the SS.12(M) and SS.11(M) for their light naval vessels; among them Brunei, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Senegal, and Tunisia. NORD also developed a ten-missile trainable launcher for either the SS.11(M) or SS.12(M), which was sold in numbers due to its extremely cost-effective firepower for both light and medium size naval craft.\n\nDuring the Falklands War, both the British Army and the British Royal Marines used Westland Scouts armed with the SS.11. On 14 June 1982, two Army and two Marine Scouts attacked Argentine positions on the south-west outskirts of Port Stanley. Of the ten missiles fired, nine hit their targets and one was lost due to a command wire breaking.\n\nA variety of warheads are available for the missile:\n\nOn launch, the SNPE rocket booster, with two outlets on the side of the missile body, burns for 1.2 seconds, after which the Sophie sustainer engine, with single outlet in the rear of the missile body burns for 20 seconds.\n\nUnlike the earlier SS.10, which steered similarly to an airplane with small flight controls called \"spoilers\" located on the missiles wings, the SS.11 is steered in flight by a unique system developed by NORD for France's first air-to-air missile, the AA.20, called TVC (thrust vectoring control) in which four small vanes are located around the sustainer's exhaust, which under command momentarily push into the sustainer's thrust causing the missile to move in the direction commanded. Since the missile spins slowly in flight by having the four swept wings slightly offset, a gyroscope is needed to determine the missile's relative orientation to the ground, that is, up, down and right, left. Unlike the earlier spoiler flight control, TVC is a far more precise method of controlling a missile in flight. TVC has been copied by other missile designs, including the Russians with their AT-3 Sagger and the Euromissile HOT and MILAN developed by joint venture of the French and Germans.\n\nDue to the manual nature of the guidance, called MCLOS, where the operator had to first gain control of the missile and bring it into his line of sight with the target, engagements of targets at short range were poor, but beyond 500 meters accuracy was good to excellent for a well trained operator. In 1967 (by which time NORD had been merged with Aerospatiale), a version of the SS.11, called Harpon, was developed with a much improved guidance system called SACLOS in which the missile is automatically tracked in flight and brought to the gunner's line of sight. This guidance system drastically increases the SS.11 accuracy, especially at engagement ranges of less than 500 meters.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2232123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232123", "title": "Prehistory and protohistory of Poland", "text": "Prehistory and protohistory of Poland\n\nThe prehistory and protohistory of Poland can be traced from the first appearance of Homo species on the territory of modern-day Poland, to the establishment of the Polish state in the 10th century AD, a span of roughly 500,000 years.\n\nThe area of present-day Poland went through the stages of socio-technical development known as the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages after experiencing the climatic shifts of the glacial periods. The best known archeological discovery from the prehistoric period is the Lusatian-culture Biskupin fortified settlement. As ancient civilizations began to appear in southern and western Europe, the cultures of the area of present-day Poland were influenced by them to various degrees.\n\nAmong the peoples that inhabited various parts of Poland up to the Iron Age stage of development were Scythian, Celtic, Germanic, Sarmatian, Roman, Avar, Vlach and Baltic tribes. In the Early Middle Ages, the area came to be dominated by West Slavic tribes and finally became home to a number of Lechitic Polish tribes that formed small states in the region beginning in the 8th century.\n\nAs with other early periods areas of human history, knowledge of these times is limited, since few written ancient and medieval sources are available; research therefore relies primarily on archeology. Written language came to Poland only after 966 AD, when the ruler of the Polish lands, Duke Mieszko I, converted to Christianity and educated foreign clerics arrived.\n\nPoland's Stone Age is divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic eras.\n\nThe Paleolithic era extended from c. 500,000 BC to 8,000 BC and is subdivided into four periods: the Lower Paleolithic, c. 500,000 to 350,000 BC; the Middle Paleolithic, c. 350,000 to 40,000 BC; the Upper Paleolithic, c. 40,000 to 10,000 BC; and the Final Paleolithic, c. 10,000 to 8000 BC.\n\nThe Mesolithic era lasted from c. 8000 to 5500 BC and the Neolithic from c. 5500 to 2300 BC.\n\nThe Neolithic is subdivided into the Neolithic proper, c. 5500 – 2900 BC, and the Copper Age, c. 2900 – 2300 BC.\n\nPoland's Stone Age lasted approximately 500,000 years and saw the appearance of three distinct Homo species: \"Homo erectus\", \"Homo neanderthalensis\" and \"Homo sapiens (humans)\". The Stone Age cultures ranged from early human groups with primitive tools to advanced agricultural and stratified societies that used sophisticated stone tools, built fortified settlements and developed copper metallurgy.\n\nAs elsewhere in Central Europe, the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic stages of Poland's Stone Age were each characterized by refinements in stone-tool-making techniques. Paleolithic human activities (whose earliest sites are 500,000 years old) were intermittent because of recurring glaciations. A general climate warming and a resulting increase in ecologic diversity were characteristic of the Mesolithic era (9000–8000 BC).\n\nThe Neolithic era ushered in the first settled agricultural communities, whose founders had migrated from the Danube River area beginning about 5500 BC. Later, the native post-Mesolithic populations would also adopt and further develop the agricultural way of life (between 4400 and about 2000 BC).\n\nPoland's Bronze Age comprised Period I, c. 2300–1600 BC; Period II, c. 1600–1350 BC; Period III, c. 1350–1100 BC; Period IV, c. 1100–900 BC; and Period V, c. 900–700 BC. The Early Iron Age included Hallstatt Period C, c. 700–600 BC, and Hallstatt Period D, c. 600–450 BC.\nPoland's Bronze- and Iron-Age cultures are known mainly from archeological research. Poland's Early Bronze Age cultures began around 2300-2400 BC, whereas the Iron Age commenced c. 700-750 BC. By the beginning of the Common Era, the Iron Age archeological cultures described in the main article no longer existed. Given the absence of written records, the ethnicities and linguistic affiliations of the groups living in Central and Eastern Europe at that time are speculative; there is considerable disagreement about their identities. In Poland, the Lusatian culture, which spanned the Bronze and Iron Ages, became particularly prominent. The most famous archeological discovery from that period is the Biskupin fortified settlement (\"gród\") that represented early-Iron-Age Lusatian culture.\n\nBronze objects were brought to Poland around 2300 BC from the Carpathian Basin. The native Early Bronze Age that followed was dominated by the innovative Unetice culture in western Poland and the conservative Mierzanowice culture in eastern Poland. These were replaced in their respective territories for the duration of the subsequent Older Bronze Period by the (pre-Lusatian) Tumulus culture and the Trzciniec culture.\n\nCharacteristic of the remaining bronze periods were the Urnfield cultures, in which skeletal burials were replaced by cremation throughout much of Europe. In Poland, the Lusatian culture settlements dominated the landscape for nearly a thousand years, continuing into the Early Iron Age. A series of Scythian invasions beginning in the 6th century BC, precipitated their demise. The Hallstatt Period D was a time of expansion for the Pomeranian culture, while the Western Baltic Kurgan culture dominated Poland's Masuria-Warmia region.\n\nThe period of the La Tène culture is subdivided into \"La Tène A\", c. 450–400 BC; \"La Tène B\", c. 400–250 BC; \"La Tène C\", c. 250–150 BC; and \"La Tène D\", c. 150–0 BC. The period from 200 to 0 BC may also be considered a younger pre-Roman period. It was followed by a period of Roman influence whose early stage lasted from c. 0 to 150 AD and its later stage from c. 150 to 375 AD. The period from 375 to 500 AD constitutes the (pre-Slavic) Migration Period.\n\nPeoples belonging to numerous archeological cultures identified with Celtic, Germanic and Baltic tribes inhabited parts of Poland during the era of classical antiquity, from about 400 BC to 450-500 AD. Other groups, difficult to identify, were most likely also present, as the ethnic composition of archeological cultures is often poorly recognized. Short of using a written language to any appreciable degree, many of them developed a relatively advanced material culture and social organization, as evidenced by the archeological record, for example by richly furnished, dynastic \"princely\" graves. Characteristic of this period were high rates of migration, often involving large groups of people.\n\nCeltic peoples established settlements beginning in the early 4th century BC, mostly in southern Poland, the outer limit of their expansion, as representatives of the La Tène culture. With their developed economy and crafts, they exerted a lasting cultural influence disproportionate to their small numbers in the region.\n\nGermanic peoples lived in what is now Poland for several centuries, during which many of their tribes also migrated southward and eastward (see Wielbark culture). With the expansion of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes came under Roman cultural influence. Some written remarks by Roman authors that are relevant to developments on Polish lands have been preserved; they provide additional insights in conjunction with the archeological record. In the end, as the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic peoples left Eastern and Central Europe for the safer and wealthier southern and western parts of the European continent.\n\nThe northeast corner of what is now Poland remained populated by Baltic tribes. They were at the outer limits of any substantial cultural influence from the Roman Empire.\n\n"}

{"id": "2232156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232156", "title": "Cashman Field", "text": "Cashman Field\n\nCashman Field is a soccer stadium in Downtown Las Vegas, Nevada. It is primarily used for soccer as the home field of Las Vegas Lights FC of the USL Championship. It was formerly the home of the Las Vegas 51s Minor League Baseball team of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. The field is adjacent to Cashman Center, an exhibit hall and theater operated by the City of Las Vegas. The complex is named for James \"Big Jim\" Cashman and his family, who have been Las Vegas entrepreneurs for several generations.\n\nCashman Field opened in 1983 as the home field of the new Las Vegas Stars, the former Spokane Indians of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, who had relocated to Las Vegas following the 1982 season. The symmetrical field boasted dimensions of down the left and right field foul lines, feet to center field, and feet to the power alleys in right-center and left-center fields. The ballpark opened with a maximum seating capacity of 9,334. Its first professional baseball game was a Major League Baseball (MLB) exhibition held on April 1, 1983, in which the San Diego Padres faced the Seattle Mariners in front of 13,878 fans. The Cashman Field attendance record of 15,025 was set on April 3, 1993, for an exhibition game between the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe ballpark played host the 1990 Triple-A All-Star Game which saw the team of National League-affiliated All-Stars defeat the team of American League-affiliated All-Stars, 8–5. Las Vegas' Eddie Williams was selected as the PCL MVP. In further interleague play, Cashman Field hosted the Triple-A World Series from 1998 until 2000. \n\nIts final professional baseball game was played on September 3, 2018. With the 51s trailing 3–2 in the bottom of the ninth inning and a runner on base, first baseman Peter Alonso hit a walk-off home run to left field giving Las Vegas a 4–3 win over the Sacramento River Cats. The 51s (renamed the Aviators) moved to Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin in 2019.\n\nIn July 2017, Las Vegas Lights FC, a team in the league then known as the United Soccer League and now as the USL Championship, was announced to begin playing at Cashman Field in 2018. Lights FC played their first game on February 10, 2018, an exhibition match against the Montreal Impact of Major League Soccer (MLS) in front of a crowd of 10,383 people. Cashman Field previously hosted MLS exhibition games between the LA Galaxy and San Jose Earthquakes, dubbed the California Clasico in 2016 and 2017. \n\nThe original configuration of Cashman Field is more suited for soccer than other former baseball parks. With center field at a right angle and all the foul territory behind first and third base at equal distance, the field is in a square shape and seats are close to the field for soccer. The Lights began renovations to make Cashman Field a soccer-specific stadium in April 2019 after the Aviators baseball team formally gave their 60-day lease termination notice that made the Lights the primary tenant.\n\nIn addition to Triple-A baseball, the stadium hosted the Oakland Athletics' first 16 home games of the 1996 season due to renovations taking place at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum. \n\nSeveral concerts were held at the field such as Jerry Cantrell and Metallica on September 12, 1998. Other concerts have included The Beach Boys, Earth, Wind & Fire and The Doobie Brothers\n\nThe field hosted the Big League Challenge from 2001 to 2003, a home run derby for star Major Leaguers after the conclusion of the MLB season.\n\nCashman Field hosted at least one Major League Baseball spring training game annually, dubbed Big League Weekend. The Cubs appeared in the game 13 consecutive times, with their final appearance in 2018. \n\nIn 2017, the stadium hosted the Mexican Baseball Fiesta, a series of two games between the Naranjeros de Hermosillo and the Águilas de Mexicali of the Mexican Pacific League.\n\nCashman Field had been suggested as a temporary stadium in the city's efforts to woo either a Major League Baseball expansion team, or an existing team desiring to move. The stadium would have served as home field until a permanent facility could be built. It had come up in the city's talks to lure the former Montreal Expos, Florida Marlins, and Oakland Athletics. However, the park would have needed considerable expansion, particularly in seating capacity, in order to host a team. The substantial costs which would be incurred in expansion and construction of a new stadium, as well as MLB concerns over Las Vegas' legalized gambling, have so far kept the city's proposals from achieving success.\n\nThe stadium was also considered for use as the home stadium for the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League starting in 2011; however, the team remained at Sam Boyd Stadium in Whitney for that season's only home game. The team again announced negotiations with Cashman for the 2012 season but decided again to remain at Sam Boyd for at least the first two games of the season. The league ceased operations before the season's other two home games, which Sam Boyd had not yet agreed to host, could take place. Cashman Field was also featured as a landmark in the video game \"\", in the city of \"Las Venturas\".\n\nDuring the last years of the 51s' stay at Cashman Field, players and staff from both the 51s and visiting teams criticized the facility. While it had been state-of-the-art when it opened, by the turn of the millennium it was considered far behind the times.\n\nPlayers complained that the field was hard on their backs and knees. The bullpens and clubhouse were also considered second-class. The weight room was smaller when compared to other Triple-A stadiums, with infielder Ty Kelly calling it \"basically just a room... not an actual weight room\". The batting cage was also a point of concern for the players. It was a single lane, which was only accessible by walking out of the clubhouse to the parking lot. Johnny Monell described the cage as one likely to be found at a high school facility and not up to par for a Triple-A stadium.\n\nDuring a 51s game on August 22, 2015, the stadium sewage system backed up, causing raw sewage to flow into the dugouts. The smell was so strong that players were forced to watch the rest of the game from chairs on the field. Team president and chief operating officer Don Logan said, \"It's disappointing that Vegas has the worst facility in our league when we have such a great town with the greatest hotels, the greatest dining, the greatest shopping. It's not becoming of this community to have a place like this.\"\n\nPacific Coast League commissioner Branch Barrett Rickey expressed his concerns about the feasibility of the continuous usage of Cashman Field as a Triple-A ballpark. In a letter to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority which owned and operated the facility, he wrote that ensuring that the upgrades necessary to keep Cashman at something approaching Triple-A standards would require spending \"many tens of millions of dollars\" that would still not be enough to make the stadium \"an optimal long-term solution.\" He also added that Cashman's days of useful life were \"well behind it,\" and that most MLB teams opted to place their top affiliations in \"far less appropriate markets\" than Las Vegas rather than deal with Cashman's shortcomings. In 2019, Cashman was replaced as a baseball park by Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin. \n\nIn 2017, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which had been the primary operators of Cashman Center and Cashman Field, turned over all operations to the City of Las Vegas. Since that time, the city has attempted to redevelop and revitalize the site, even soliciting ideas from the public. In 2018, the site was considered for a proposed stadium for the National Football League's Oakland Raiders during the team's relocation bid, however it was beat out by a larger site closer to the Las Vegas Strip. The city, so far, has been unsuccessful in its attempt to redevelop the site, with the convention halls and theater remaining closed, and only Cashman Field hosting events.\n\nOn June 5, 2019, the Las Vegas City Council voted to begin negotiations with the Renaissance Group to redevelop the Cashman Center and adjacent land also owned by the city to feature a new 25,000-seat soccer stadium as well as retail, hotels and residences. If an agreement is reached within the 180 day time limit (expiring on December 3, 2019), Lights FC owner Brett Lashbrook has agreed to sell the team to Boston-based Baupost Group in effort to make the Lights a Major League Soccer expansion franchise. Under the Renaissance Group's proposal, Cashman Field's current playing field would remain as a practice field for the Lights FC.\n\nThe original Cashman Field was built in 1947 on a site at Las Vegas Boulevard and Bonanza Avenue. The stadium was used for football and rodeos before the first baseball game was held on May 21, 1948. The stadium was designed primarily for football, rodeo, concerts and boxing with one large grandstand. For baseball this meant all the seats were along first base line. The stadium was home to the Las Vegas Wranglers from 1947 to 1952 and again from 1957 to 1958. Boxing matches were also held at the facility. The first professional football game in Las Vegas was held at the stadium in 1964 when the American Football League then-Oakland Raiders played the then-Houston Oilers.\n\n\n"}

It is the home field of the Salt Lake Bees of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League and the collegiate Utah Utes of the Pac-12 Conference.\n\nSmith's Ballpark opened in 1994 with a seating capacity of 15,400, the largest in the PCL. It is located on the site of its predecessor, Derks Field, with a similar unorthodox southeast alignment, toward the Wasatch Range. The elevation at street level is above sea level.\n\nIn its inaugural season in 1994, the Buzz set a PCL attendance record with 713,224 fans. The team led the PCL in attendance in each of its first six seasons in Salt Lake. The largest crowd at the ballpark is 16,531 in 2000; the Saturday night opponent was the Albuquerque Dukes on July 22.\n\nBesides hosting the Salt Lake Bees, Smith's Ballpark has played host to two exhibition games featuring the Minnesota Twins, a spring training game featuring the Seattle Mariners and the Colorado Rockies, concerts, soccer matches, and high school and college baseball games, including a Mountain West Conference tournament.\n\nThe ballpark has hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game twice. In 1996, a team of National League-affiliated All-Stars defeated their American League opponents, 2–1. Salt Lake's Todd Walker was selected as the PCL MVP. The game returned to the park in 2011 with the International League All-Stars beating the PCL team, 3–0.\n\nAfter Franklin Covey's 15-year naming rights agreements expired in 2009, an agreement with Spring Mobile, an AT&T Mobility authorized retailer, made the ballpark's name Spring Mobile Ballpark for five seasons.\n\nIn March 2014, it was announced that Salt Lake City-based Smith's Food and Drug had signed a six-year naming rights deal, giving the park its current name.\n\nSmith's Ballpark has one of the biggest upper decks in the minor leagues, which are uncommon outside of the majors. The ballpark also contains 24 luxury suites on the third level along with two private party patios.\n\nSmith's Ballpark is noted for its stunning views of the Wasatch Mountains over the left and center field walls.\n\nThe stadium is located one block east of Ballpark station on the TRAX light rail system.\n\nWhen the ballpark opened in 1994, it was called Franklin Quest Field, which the Franklin Quest Company paid $1.4 million for 15 years for the naming rights in the summer of 1993. It changed its name to Franklin Covey Field in 1997 after Franklin Quest merged with the Covey Leadership Center, becoming Franklin Covey.\n\nIn 2009, the Bees announced on April 7 that they had reached a multi-year naming-rights deal with Spring Mobile (a Salt Lake City-based AT&T authorized retailer) to provide the ballpark's new name of Spring Mobile Ballpark which ran for five seasons.

It was released by Japanese record company Captain Trip Records in August 2001.\n\nAfter singer, guitarist and main songwriter Lou Reed quit the Velvet Underground in August 1970, the band carried on: Doug Yule assumed leadership and moved to lead vocals and guitar, and Walter Powers joined to play bass guitar. This version of the Velvet Underground, which still featured original member Sterling Morrison and longtime drummer Maureen Tucker, played around 30 dates to promote the band's fourth album, \"Loaded\" (1970).\n\nAlmost a year after Reed's departure, Morrison also left the band; he was replaced by Boston-based keyboardist Willie Alexander. The band now contained no founding members (although Tucker had been a member since before the recording of the Velvets' debut album). They then went to tour the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, still in support of \"Loaded\", which had had a March 1971 release date in Europe. Two dates of this tour, November 5, 1971 in London and November 19 in Amsterdam, were recorded by members of the audience, and appear as discs one and two of this set, respectively. The Amsterdam concert was also recorded from the soundboard by Dutch radio station VPRO and subsequently broadcast on FM radio. A few tracks from this broadcast were recorded by a fan and appear as tracks 11–14 on disc four of this set.\n\nOnce the European tour was completed, initial plans were for the Yule–Alexander–Powers–Tucker line-up to record a new studio album in England. However, band manager Steve Sesnick sent Alexander, Powers and Tucker back to America, and Yule recorded \"Squeeze\" backed by session musicians.\n\nSesnick then assembled a backing band around Yule to once again tour the United Kingdom in support of \"Squeeze\". Shortly before the tour started, however, Sesnick quit as the Velvets' manager. Yule and the band struggled through the dates, then called it quits. One date of this tour, December 6, 1972, at St David's College, Lampeter, was recorded by an audience member and appears as disc three of this set.\n\nIn the spring of 1973 at the urging of a tour manager, Yule and some friends toured New England with a new group, which included some Velvet Underground material in their set lists. The tour manager insisted on billing the band as being the Velvet Underground despite demands from Yule not to do so. Yule fired the manager after three dates and the tour dissolved shortly thereafter. One date from this tour, May 27, 1973 in Boston, was recorded by an audience member and appears as disc four of this set.\n\nIronically Sweet Jane on disc 4 contains the original deleted verse, while Lou Reed Live does not.\n\nAll songs written by Lou Reed except as noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The stadium has since been demolished and is now the site of a new social housing complex called Victoria Crescent, after the club.\n\nOn the park, the greatest era in the club's history was the mid- to late 1950s. In 1956 the club played in front of 20,100 people at Shawfield Stadium in the semi final of the Scottish Junior Cup, only to lose 3–2 to eventual winners Petershill.

They were the only 2-8-2Ts built and used by a British railway, and the largest tank engines to run on the Great Western Railway.\n\nOriginally the 4200 class and 5205 class 2-8-0T were introduced for short-haul Welsh coal traffic, but the Stock Market Crash of 1929 saw coal traffic dramatically fall. Built specifically for the short runs of heavy trains in the South Wales Coalfield, Charles Collett took the agreed decision to rebuild some of them with an extended coal carrying capacity by adding to the frames, requiring the addition of a trailing wheel set, making them 2-8-2T.\n\nWith the work carried out at Swindon Works, the first to be converted was 5275 (lot 266), which returned to traffic numbered 7200 in August 1934. An official photograph of the prototype was taken on 27 July 1934 at the usual site outside 'A Shop' for engine pictures. Nos. 5276–94 were similarly rebuilt between August and November 1934, becoming 7201–19, and nos. 7220–39 were rebuilt from 5255–74 between August 1935 and February 1936; with both batches, the rebuilding was not in numerical order, but the new numbers were in the same sequence as the old. Nos. 7240–53, rebuilt August 1937–December 1939, were selected at random from locomotives numbered in the 4200 series.\n\nThe final batch of the class were later fitted with newly developed 'Coal Scuttle' bunkers. These bunkers consisted of a higher rivet line increasing the water capacity up to a total of 2,700 gallons allowing the locos to travel longer distances. The bunker was also designed to facilitate the movement of the coal towards the hatch in the cab, however ‘scuttle bunkers’ would only carry 5 tonnes of coal instead of 6. No.7200 is the only surviving loco of the class to carry one of these unique bunkers.\n\nThe 54 rebuilt locos found work in most parts of the GWR system, where their great weight was allowed, although the rebuilt chassis length did get them banned from certain goods yards. Many found work in the home counties, deployed on iron ore and stone trains from Banbury.\n\nThe first member of the class to be withdrawn was number 7241 in November 1962, whilst the last four engines in traffic served until June 1965. Four of the class were bought by Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, and no. 7226 was scrapped there in 1965.\nThree locomotives survive, all recovered from Woodham Brothers, though none have been restored:\n\nIn 2012, Hornby released models of the 7200 class in both the original GWR green and BR black. \n\n"}

Scarpa portrayed a Native American wrestler, who wore a war bonnet to the ring and would \"go on the warpath\" when the fans started cheering him against an opponent. It has been acknowledged that he was in fact an Italian-American.\n\nScarpa's wrestling career began in 1947, under his real name. He was a standout in the Georgia and Florida territories of the National Wrestling Alliance throughout the 1950s and 1960s, winning several championships and becoming a fan favorite.\n\nIn 1970, Scarpa began working for Vincent J. McMahon's World Wide Wrestling Federation as Chief Jay Strongbow, a Native American gimmick complete with a traditional headdress and Native themed wrestling moves. He feuded with the likes of \"The Golden Greek\" Spiros Arion, \"Handsome Jimmy\" Valiant, and Superstar Billy Graham, nearly winning the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship. A memorable match against \"Iron Mike\" McCord featured Strongbow applying his sleeper hold. But Lou Albano, McCord's manager, interfered by smashing a cast on the Chief's forehead. It was alleged that Strongbow had previously jumped Albano in the locker room, breaking his arm. McCord was disqualified, but Strongbow was cut wide open by Albano's blows. Strongbow settled the score in front of a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, beating Captain Lou Albano convincingly.\n\nStrongbow picked up a win at Madison Square Garden in the summer of 1970, shortly after he entered the WWWF, pinning top contender Crusher Verdue, who was managed by Lou Albano.\n\nIn 1975, he began feuding with Spiros Arion. Arion, a popular and seemingly unbeatable babyface, returned to the WWWF after an absence and teamed with Strongbow. Arion turned on Strongbow, destroying his headdress on Philadelphia television after he had tied Strongbow in the ropes, and rubbed the feathers in his face. Arion was now a heel, and pinned Strongbow in eastern arenas as he went on to challenge champion Bruno Sammartino.\n\nStrongbow won his first WWWF World Tag Team Championship on May 22, 1972 with partner Sonny King. They defeated the team of Baron Mikel Scicluna and King Curtis Iaukea. Strongbow and King held the title for a month before losing it to the team of Mr. Fuji and Professor Toru Tanaka on June 27.\n\nFour and a half years later, on December 7, 1976, Strongbow won his second WWWF World Tag Team Championship, this time with partner Billy White Wolf. The team won the title in a three-team tournament, defeating The Executioners and Nikolai Volkoff and Tor Kamata. Their reign was cut short in August 1977 when the belts were vacated due to White Wolf suffering a neck injury at the hands of Ken Patera's Swinging Full Nelson.\n\nIn 1979, he feuded with Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, who broke Strongbow's leg. The two wrestled all over the WWF circuit, including an \"Indian Strap match\" at Madison Square Garden on July 30, 1979.\n\nStrongbow also competed for The Sheik's Big Time Wrestling promotion in Detroit. He had a memorable feud with \"Bulldog\" Don Kent, which culminated in a \"shark cage match\" in 1976. Strongbow and Kent fought inside of a small shark cage, with the first man to escape being declared the winner. With an assist from fellow fan favorite Mark Lewin, Strongbow was able to escape the shark cage victorious.\n\nAfter wrestling in the WWF for 9 years, Strongbow went to work for Georgia Championship Wrestling and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. In Detroit he feuded with Don Kent once again. Then he feuded with Baron Von Raschke in Georgia. He won the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship defeating Luke Graham on October 11, 1980 in Puerto Rico. Then dropped the title on December 20 to Danny Condrey. In 1981 he went to Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling where he feuded with Kevin Sullivan.\n\nIn 1982, Strongbow formed a tag team with his on-screen brother, Jules Strongbow. On June 28, the Strongbows won the tag team championship from the team of Mr. Fuji and Mr. Saito in New York City's Madison Square Garden. During the match, special guest referee Ivan Putski counted the winning fall, but did not see Fuji's foot draped over the bottom rope. On the July 13 episode of \"Championship Wrestling\", the Strongbows lost the titles back to Fuji and Saito, but on the October 26 episode of \"Championship Wrestling\", the Strongbows defeated Fuji and Saito for their second WWF Tag Team Championship reign as a team. On the March 8, 1983 episode of \"Championship Wrestling\", the Strongbows lost the titles to The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika). After failing in regaining the belts, the Strongbows disbanded.\n\nStrongbow retired in 1986, but would still step back into the ring from time to time, most notably for a legends battle royal in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 1987. In retirement, Strongbow became a WWF road agent and worked in the company's front office. He also participated in a 1994 storyline in which he mentored Tatanka (an actual Native American of the Lumbee tribe). Strongbow was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 by Gorilla Monsoon. Strongbow's last appearance in WWE was a brief appearance on the November 17, 2008 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" when Stephanie McMahon introduced him to the audience in Atlanta.\n\nHis son, Joe Jr. wrestled in the 1980s and early 1990s mainly as Mark Pyle and Mark Young in the WWF from 1986–1990 and Vince Young in WCW. Joe Jr. died in 2016 at the age of 48. He also has a daughter Connie Pacheco of Portland, Oregon.\n\nScarpa suffered a fall at his home in late 2011 and was hospitalized. He never recovered and died on April 3, 2012 at the age of 83. He is buried in Griffin, Georgia.\n\n\n"}

Harbor Park opened on April 14, 1993, and can seat 11,856 people.\n\nSeating includes 9,000 lower deck seats, 2,800 upper deck seats and a 300-person capacity picnic area. The stadium also features 24 luxury skyboxes with seating for 400, and a 225-seat full-service restaurant with a panoramic view of the field from the first base side. A record crowd of 14,263 was reached August 31, 1996.\n\nThe field is made of natural grass and features a state of the art irrigation and drainage system. The outfield dimensions are 333 feet to the left field foul pole, 400 feet to straightaway center, and 318 down the right field line.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the stadium served as the home field for some of Norfolk's high school football games, primarily Maury, Granby, and Booker T. Washington. In 1996, BTW opened a new stadium on the school campus; in 2005, Maury and Granby moved to a new facility, Powhatan Field. In the past, the stadium also hosted high school football postseason games, although that has not happened since 2012.\n\nThe Tide light rail has a station along Park Avenue, adjacent to Harbor Park stadium.

Norfolk's bid was rejected and the Expos eventually became the Washington Nationals.\n\nOn March 30, 2007, the Washington Nationals played an exhibition game against the Baltimore Orioles at Harbor Park. The game was sold out two weeks in advance; attendance was 12,408. The Orioles and Nationals played another exhibition game in 2009; the Orioles and Tides also play each other in occasional exhibition games, having done so in 2012, 2014, and 2018.\n\nOn October 28, 2008, Barack Obama held a rally at Harbor Park.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, the city of Norfolk approved a plan by the Tides to build a party deck in right field, behind the home team's bullpen. Completed in March 2009, two weeks before an Orioles–Nationals exhibition game, the deck holds 400 people but did not increase stadium capacity, except during sold-out games, when the deck accommodates some overflow. The right field fence was moved in 20 feet, to accommodate the deck, setting it at its current distance of 318 feet.\n\nThe concert band piece \"Harbor Park Holiday\", written in 1996 by Norfolk native James L.

{"id": "2232181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232181", "title": "Psychological adaptation", "text": "Psychological adaptation\n\nA psychological adaptation is a functional, cognitive or behavioral trait that benefits an organism in its environment. Psychological adaptations fall under the scope of evolved psychological mechanisms (EPMs), however, EPMs refer to a less restricted set. Psychological adaptations include only the functional traits that increase the fitness of an organism, while EPMs refer to any psychological mechanism that developed through the processes of evolution. These additional EPMs are the by-product traits of a species’ evolutionary development (see spandrels), as well as the vestigial traits that no longer benefit the species’ fitness. It can be difficult to tell whether a trait is vestigial or not, so some literature is more lenient and refers to vestigial traits as adaptations, even though they may no longer have adaptive functionality. For example, xenophobic attitudes and behaviors appear to have certain EPM influences relating to disease aversion, however, in certain environments these behaviors may actually have a poor effect on a person's fitness. The principles of psychological adaptation rely on Darwin's theory of evolution and are important to the fields of evolutionary psychology, biology, and cognitive science.\n\nCharles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution in \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859). His theory dictates that adaptations are traits that arise from the selective pressures a species faces in its environment. Adaptations must benefit either an organism's chance of survival or reproduction to be considered adaptive, and are then passed down to the next generation through this process of natural selection. Psychological adaptions are those adaptive traits that we consider cognitive or behavioral. These can include conscious social strategies, subconscious emotional responses (guilt, fear, etc.), or the most innate instincts. Evolutionary psychologists consider a number of factors in what determines a psychological adaptation, such as functionality, complexity, efficiency, and universality. \"The Adapted Mind\" is considered a foundational text on evolutionary psychology, further integrating Darwinian theory into modern psychology.\n\nAn area of disagreement arises between evolutionary psychologists, cognitive scientists and behaviourists on where to draw the line on what is considered a psychological adaptation, and what is considered a learned behaviour. Where behaviourism explains certain behaviours as conditioned responses, cognitivism may push that these behaviours arise from a psychological adaptation that institutes a preference for that behaviour. Evolutionary psychology proposes that the human psychology consists primarily of psychological adaptations, which is opposed by the \"tabula rasa\" or blank slate model of human psychology. Early behaviourists, like B.F. Skinner, tended to the blank slate model and argued that innate behaviors and instincts were few, some behaviourists suggesting that the only innate behavior was the ability to learn. On the other hand, Steven Pinker presents the cognitivist perspective in his book, \"The Blank Slate\", in which he challenges the \"tabula rasa\" models and argues that human behaviour is shaped by psychological adaptations.\n\nThis difference in theory can be seen in research on modern human sexual preferences, with behaviourists arguing that attraction has conditioning influences, such as from the media or cultural norms, while others arguing it is based on psychological adaptations. However, sexual preferences are a difficult subject to test due to the amount of variance and flexibility exhibited in human mate choice. A hybrid resolution to psychological adaptations and learned behaviours refers to an adaptation as the species’ capacity for a certain behavior, while each individual organism still needs to be conditioned to exhibit that behaviour. This approach can explain language acquisition in relation to linguist and cognitive scientist Noam Chomsky's model of human language. His model supports that the capacity for language is a psychological adaptation (involving both the language necessary brain structures and disposition for language acquisition), however, children lack any particular instantiation of language at birth, and must instead learn one in their environment.\n\nThe mating strategies of both sexes can be simplified into different psychological adaptations. There is extensive evidence that incest avoidance, which is the tendency to avoid sexual intercourse with close relatives is an evolved behavioural adaptation. Incest avoidance can be seen cross-culturally in humans, and is evident in wild animals. Evolutionary psychologists argue that incest avoidance adapted due to the greater chance of producing children with severe disabilities when mating with relatives, and because genetic variability offers an increase in fitness regarding offspring survival. Sexual jealousy is another behavior observed in human and non-human animals that appears to be instinctual. Heuristic problem solving and consistent preference for behavioral patterns are considered by some evolutionary psychologists to be psychological adaptations. For example, the tendency for females to change their sexual strategies when faced with developmental pressures such as an absent father may be the result of a psychological adaptation.\n\nHuman males have developed psychological adaptations, which make them attractive to the opposite sex in order to increase their reproductive success. Evolutionarily, it pays for a male to be polygynous – \"to have a number of female partners at once\" – because it means he can create more offspring at once, as they don't have to invest any time in carrying a foetus. Examples of some of these other adaptations include strategies to entice females, strategies to retain a partner and the desire for short-term relationships.\nIt has been researched that humour is sexually selected and acts as a fitness indicator. The production of humour increases mate value in men, and so women seek males with a good sense of humour. In turn, males have developed an adaptation in which they produce humour to attract women.\nHuman males have developed an adaptation in which they find women more attractive if they show cues of fertility, such as a good waist–hip ratio. Women with a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 are considered more attractive to males than those with a ratio of 0.8, who are considered to have a more masculine figure. This is because they are perceived to be able to have children more and to be more fertile and healthy.\n\nMales have developed behaviours that help them to retain a mate, also known as mate guarding, in order to enhance reproductive success in long-term relationships. Examples are intersexual manipulations which involves the male manipulating the way his partner views their current relationship and to repulse her from other relationships. He could do this by enhancing his own value or decreasing the value of other males. In extreme cases, some men have developed intersexual adaptations that restrict their partner from interacting with other males, including the use of violence. By doing this, women are less likely to stray from her current relationship, even if it is due to fear. On the other hand, intrasexual manipulations are used to reduce any other options for the females, which could include decreasing their partner's value or make it clear to other males that the female is 'theirs' by using possessive techniques such as holding her hand in public.\n\nWith regards to parental investment, males are much more wary when investing in offspring as they cannot guarantee that the child is theirs. Therefore, as an adaption, males tend to only invest in offspring if there are high levels of commitment and if they were produced in a long-term relationship as opposed to short-term relationships.\n\nHuman males have also developed an adaptation in which they have a desire for short-term relationships more than females do. This is because men hardly have any investment obligation, whereas a female has to carry a child for nine months if she was to fall pregnant after the sexual encounter. Evolutionarily, it is thought that males have a desire to reproduce as much as they can, and short-term relationships are a good way to inseminate many women with his sperm in order for his genes to continue through generations. There is much evidence for how this short-term mating has evolved psychologically for males, beginning with the desire for a variety of sex partners. It seems that a larger percentage of men, in every culture of the world, desire more than one sex partner in one month compared to women. Furthermore, men are more likely than women to have sexual intercourse with someone having known them for only one hour, one day, one week or one month.\n\nHowever, there are some adaptive problems in short-term mating that men must solve; one of these is avoiding commitment and women who might not have sex with the male until they have a signal of commitment or investment. This would reduce the number of partners a male could pursue and succeed with.\n\nFemale sex-specific adaptations provide evidence of special design for the purpose of increasing fitness and in turn, reproductive success. For example, mate choice, rape aversion tactics and pregnancy sickness are all female-specific psychological adaptations, identified through empirical research, found to increase genetic contributions through survival and reproduction.\n\nA psychological adaptation for the purpose of reproductive success can be seen in female mate choice. David Buss, an evolutionary psychologist, examines the fundamental principles of selection pressures that create human mate preferences in his contribution to the publication \"The Adapted Mind\". Females have evolved psychological procedures that affect mating decisions in relation to certain male physical attributes and behaviours. Robert Trivers, an evolutionary biologist, outlines the evolutionary basis of these preferences in relation to parental investment and sexual selection. He proposes that females have adapted a preference to mate with males who display both an ability and willingness to invest vital resources for the survival of the female and her offspring. Research suggests females are able to use external cues displayed by males such as territory or physical possessions.\n\nFor example, women are able to evaluate the long-term presence of testosterone in men by observing facial testosterone cues. Testosterone stimulates craniofacial development and results in a squarer jaw and consequently, a more masculine appearance. Women in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle perceive masculine faces as healthier and more attractive than feminine male faces. Females show a psychological adaptation to detect mate quality using these hormonal cues which display the male's fitness and reproductive value. Males who display testosterone cues show a female that they are able to offset the high physiological costs such as immunosuppressant effects.\n\nResearch proposes that women have evolved psychological mechanisms specifically designed to motivate rape-avoidance behaviours or strategies. This is because rape poses severe costs for the female such as pregnancy, physical harm, injury or death, relationship abandonment and self-esteem depletion. The greatest cost to the female is the circumvention of her mate choice, which threatens reproductive success, resulting in the possession of adaptations in response. \nEvidence suggests that a number of female-specific traits have evolved in order to reduce the risks associated with experiencing rape. The body-guard hypothesis proposes that rape-avoidance drives women's mate preferences for physically or dominant males. Women may also form groups with men and women as a protective alliance against potential rapists. Psychological pain experienced following rape is also identified as an adaptive process designed to focus the female on the social circumstances surrounding the rape for future prevention.\n\nEvidence for this as an adaptation can be seen in reproductive-aged women who are found to experience more psychological pain following rape due to an increased risk of conception. Research also suggests that women in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle perform fewer risky behaviours that could potentially result in the risk of rape. Women's capacity to resist rape also changes relative to their menstrual cycle; females in the fertile phase show an increase in handgrip strength when placed in a threatening, sexually coercive scenario. Susceptibility to signs of a male's coerciveness is also identified to be better in fertile women.\n\nOne psychological adaptation found solely in women is pregnancy sickness. This is an adaptation resulting from natural selection for the purpose of avoiding toxic-containing foods during pregnancy. Margaret Profet, an evolutionary biologist, provides evidence for this adaptation in a literature review on pregnancy sickness. Particular plant foods, whilst unharmful to adults, can contain toxins (e.g. teratogens) that are dangerous for developing embryos and can potentially cause birth defects such as facial asymmetry. Evidence lies in the finding that women who experience more extreme cases of pregnancy sickness tend to be less likely to miscarry or have babies with birth defects. This fits the criteria for an adaptation as it enhances fitness and increases reproductive success – it results in greater fertility of the mother and contributes to the health of the developing embryo.\n\nResearchers dispute whether this is actually a psychological adaptation, however evidence advocates it is the result of strong selective pressures in our hereditary past. For example, the toxins are found only in natural wild plant foods, not processed foods in our modern-day environment. Furthermore, pregnant women experiencing sickness have been found to avoid particular bitter or pungent smelling foods, potentially containing toxins. Pregnancy induced sickness only typically occurs 3 weeks after conception, around the time when the embryo has started forming major organs and is therefore at the highest risk. It is also a cross-cultural universal adaptation, a suggestion it is an innate mechanism.\n"}

The high rate of fire was needed for the small period of time when the gunner would be able to fire at an attacking aircraft. The weapon was also adopted for land use during World War II.\n\nThe Vickers K was a development of the Vickers-Berthier (VB) light machine gun, adopted in 1932 by the Indian Army. The VB, like the Bren light machine gun, used a locking tilting breechblock. However, unlike the Bren, the VB locked its breech only at the last moment of forward travel and this enabled the development of the Vickers K also known as the \"Vickers Gas Operated\" (VGO) or \"Vickers GO\" . With lighter moving parts and the VB locking design, the Vickers K had an adjustable rate of fire between 950 and 1,200 rounds per minute; faster than the German MG34. The weapon was adopted for British service as the VGO. It was test-flown with a large 300-round pan magazine, and beat the .303 Browning in reliability. However, the wide pan would have caused problems to accommodate, since it would have interfered with wing structures. When the belt-fed Browning Mark II was selected as the standard machine-gun armament for RAF aircraft, the VGO became redundant for the RAF. It continued to be used by the Fleet Air Arm until 1945.\n\nSome were made in 7.7mm for the Belgians before the war and at least one example survives in a European museum.\n\nThe Vickers class K/Vickers G.O. machine gun is a gas-operated weapon, firing from an open bolt (thus making it non-synchronizable for firing through a spinning propeller) in full automatic mode only. Its gas cylinder is located below the barrel, and a long-stroke gas piston operates a vertically tilting bolt. Feed is from top-mounted flat pan magazines with a nominal capacity of 100 rounds, although it was customary to load only 96 or 97 rounds to ensure reliable feeding. The gun is fitted with a single spade grip at the rear of receiver, with trigger to control fire. In ground use, it was normally mounted on single or twin pintle mounts on various jeeps and trucks.\n\nOriginally intended for RAF airfield defence units, these guns were remanufactured from original Vickers G.O. No.1 Mk.1 aircraft guns. A number of these ‘Vickers G.O. Land Service’ machine guns found their way to a variety of British commando and reconnaissance units which operated in Europe during 1944 and 1945. The Land variant has the spade grip replaced with a \"semi bullpup\" short stock at the rear and a pistol grip with trigger below the receiver. A short forend or a folding carrying handle are added below the gas cylinder, and a folding bipod is attached to the gas block. New iron sights are provided on folding bases.\n\nA camera gun version was made for training. The body was of cast metal. The grip and trigger mechanism were realistic. Gunners in training exposed film when \"shooting\" at attacking aircraft and these images were analysed later. This was a technique developed in World War I with Lewis Camera Guns.\n\nThe Vickers K was fitted to light and medium bombers in RAF service such as the Fairey Battle and Handley Page Hampden. It was also used in gun turrets, such as the dorsal turret in the Bristol Blenheim, the nose turret in the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and the rear of the cockpit in the Fairey Battle. It was the standard Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm \"Telegraphist Air Gunner\" machine gun, on British built carrier (Torpedo Strike Reconnaissance) aircraft - the Fairey Swordfish, the Fairey Albacore and the Fairey Barracuda.\n\nAs supplies of air-cooled .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns increased the Vickers G.O. was phased out of use with the RAF. These machine guns were then reallocated from RAF stocks to units of the British and Commonwealth armies. The gun continued in service with the Fleet Air Arm and its last recorded use by the navy was by 812 Squadron RNAS Barracudas in anti piracy patrols off Hong Kong in October 1945.\n\nThe Long Range Desert Group was supplied with large numbers of the Vickers G.O. for use on its vehicles. They were used in single or custom built twin mountings. The Special Air Service adopted it for their hit and run tactics, mounting it in pairs on their jeeps. Over the years, it was assumed by some that the latter services took the phased-out VGO because they could obtain no other suitable machine guns but with its high rate of fire and low-friction locking design (which proved resistant to jams from sand), the LRDG and SAS found the G.O. markedly superior to either the .303 in (7.7 mm) water-cooled Vickers or the Bren gun. In a similar manner, the Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron of the Reconnaissance Corps mounted the VGO on jeeps when they were attached to the 1st Airborne Division during Operation Market-Garden in September 1944. Royal Marine and Army Commandos used the VGO for infantry support/squad automatic weapon briefly around D-Day. In military terminology, it was known as Gun, Machine, Vickers G.O. .303-inch.\n\nIn the Coastal Forces of the Royal Navy, the Vickers K began to replace the Lewis gun on board Motor Torpedo Boats, Motor Launches and other light craft, from 1942 onwards.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2232219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232219", "title": "Tarquinia (gens)", "text": "Tarquinia (gens)\n\nThe gens Tarquinia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome, usually associated with Lucius Tarquinius Priscus and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the fifth and seventh Kings of Rome. Most of the Tarquinii who appear in history are connected in some way with this dynasty, but a few appear during the later Republic, and others from inscriptions, some dating as late as the fourth century AD.\n\nThe legendary origin of the Tarquinii who reigned at Rome begins with Demaratus of Corinth, a member of the house of the Bacchiadae at Corinth, which was expelled in 657 BC. Demaratus settled at Tarquinii in Etruria, where he married an Etruscan noblewoman, and had two sons, Lucius and Arruns, who took the surname \"Tarquinius\" after the town of their birth. Denied political advancement due to his father's foreign birth, Lucius, encouraged by his wife, Tanaquil, determined to settle at Rome, where he could hope to attain high station based solely on his merits. He fell into the retinue of Ancus Marcius, the fourth Roman king, becoming his trusted advisor. Since the Roman monarchy was elected, rather than strictly hereditary, when Marcius died, Tarquinius successfully argued that he should be named the next king, in preference to the sons of Marcius.\n\nLucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last Roman king, was said to have been the son or grandson of the elder Tarquin, while Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, one of the first Roman consuls was his cousin. Other Tarquinii are mentioned as part of this family, although it is not entirely clear how some of them were related. It is likely that there were additional kings and perhaps other members of the Tarquin dynasty during this period.\n\nIt is not clear whether the early Tarquinii should be regarded as patricians or plebeians. The consul Collatinus is generally regarded as a patrician, but as Cornell explains, none of the families that claimed descent from or kinship with the Roman kings were considered patrician in later times, while none of Rome's leading patrician families is represented among the kings. The patricians may have chosen the king, but were probably not eligible for the office, and it is unlikely that the kings themselves were admitted to the patriciate once chosen. It may be that Collatinus was granted patrician status on the overthrow of the Roman monarchy; but as he then accepted exile according to the demand of his colleague, Lucius Junius Brutus, the matter becomes academic, as there was no tradition of patrician Tarquinii at Rome in later times. The Tarquinii of the later Republic were plebeians.\n\nThe nomen \"Tarquinius\" appears to be the Latin form of the Etruscan \"Tarchna\", apparently the same as the \"Tarchunies\" named in one of the frescoes in the famous François Tomb at Vulci. The nomen is certainly derived from the city of Tarquinii, in Etruscan \"Tarchna\" or \"Tarchuna\", after its legendary founder, the folk-hero Tarchon, although in historical times the Tarchna family had branches at both Tarquinii and Caere.\n\n\n\n"}

She is one of China's most successful female gymnasts and was the first Chinese woman to medal in an all-around competition at the World Championships.\n\nShe is married to 2004 Olympic champion Teng Haibin.\n\nZhang won four gold medals at the 2002 Asian Games (team, all-around, uneven bars, and floor exercise) and the 2003 Asian Championships (team, all-around, balance beam, and floor exercise). She became China's first female medalist in a world all-around competition by winning the bronze medal at the 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. She followed this feat by becoming the second Chinese woman to win an Olympic all-around medal, also a bronze, at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. (Liu Xuan had won the bronze in the previous Olympics after the gold medalist, Andreea Răducan of Romania, was disqualified.)\n\nThe Chinese team finished 7th at the 2004 Olympics after counting a fall on bars, two falls on beam, and two falls on floor, one of them from Zhang. However, Zhang won an individual bronze medal in the all-around competition behind Carly Patterson of the United States and Svetlana Khorkina of Russia. She also competed in the balance beam event final, her strongest event, but fell and placed 6th with a score of 9.237. Without the 0.5 deduction for the fall, she would have edged out Romania's Alexandra Eremia for the bronze.\n\nZhang went on to win the all-around at the 2005 Chinese National Championships and the 2005 East Asian Games.

During the team final, she contributed to China's victory with strong routines on vault (scoring 14.525 under a new system), balance beam (15.950), and floor exercise (14.800). The win for the Chinese team was its first ever.\n\nShe qualified to the balance beam final with the top score, 16.075, but finished 4th in the final with a score of 15.275 after injuring her ankle by falling down a flight of stairs the day before the competition.\n\nZhang also competed at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, where the Chinese women captured their seventh straight team title. She went on to help the Chinese women sweep all but one of the gold medals in the women's gymnastics competition, winning the balance beam title ahead of her teammate Han Bing.\n\nOver the course of the two years following the 2006 World Championships, Zhang struggled to maintain the level of difficulty in her routines. As a result, she did not qualify to represent China at the 2007 World Championships. She continued her attempt to make a second Olympic team by increasing her difficulty, but struggled with consistency. At the 2008 Chinese National Championships, she won a silver medal on balance beam, partly thanks to errors by many other competitors.\n\nZhang was named to the Chinese Olympic training squad but was not selected to compete at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.

She was a prominent Buddhist master in Asia and also taught in the United States where she influenced the American branch of the Vipassana movement.\n\nShe was born Nani Bala Barua in 1911 in a small village in Chittagong, East Bengal, then in British India but now part of Bangladesh.\n\nIn her childhood she showed an exceptional interest in Buddhist rituals and preferred to study rather than play. She very much wanted to attend school but in 1923 at the age of twelve she was married and later went to live with her husband, an engineer, in Rangoon. He soon left to work in Burma, leaving her with her in-laws. Eventually she moved to Burma to join her husband. In 1929 when Nani was 18 her mother died unexpectedly, leaving behind a baby boy named Bijoy which Nani and her husband took to raise in Burma, as they had not yet had a child.\n\nAt the age of 35 Nani conceived and give birth to her first child, a baby girl, who fell ill and died at three months of age. Four years later, in 1950, Nani gave birth to a daughter, Dipa, whereupon Nani began to be called Dipa Ma \"Mother of Dipa\" as her daughter's survival was a momentous event. This was followed by yet another loss of a child (her first son) at birth, the sudden death of her husband in 1957, and subsequent extreme grief and physical pains.\n\nAfter her husband died, \"Dipa Ma\" was extremely unhappy. One day a doctor suggested that she learn how to meditate. She attended her first meditation retreat at the Kamayut Meditation Center in Rangoon. She soon after attended her second retreat, at the Thathana Yeiktha center, where the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was teacher-in-residence. There she experienced the first stage of enlightenment.\n\nIn 1963 she was chosen to study the siddhis or spiritual powers with the Indian master Anagarika Munindra, a senior student of Mahasi Sayadaw. According to scholars, the \"Visuddhimagga\" is one of the extremely rare texts within the enormous literatures of various forms of Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism to give explicit details about how spiritual masters were thought to actually manifest supernormal abilities. Abilities such as flying through the air, walking through solid obstructions, diving into the ground, walking on water and so forth are performed by changing one element, such as earth, into another element, such as air. The individual must master \"kasina\" meditation before this is possible. Dipa Ma, who trained via the \"Visuddhimagga\", was said to demonstrate these abilities.\n\nIn 1967, she returned to India, moving to Calcutta where she taught meditation. Her first formal student was her neighbor, Malati Barua, a widow trying to raise six young children alone. Believing that enlightenment was possible in any environment, Dipa Ma devised practices that her new student could carry out at home.\n\nIn the 1970s, she was a teacher of Sylvia Boorstein, Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, Michelle Levey, and Sharon Salzberg, who later became prominent teachers in the United States. In the early 1980s Dipa Ma taught at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts.\n\nShe died at the age of 78, in 1989 in India, while bowing before a statue of the Buddha. She was survived by her daughter Dipa, an employee of the Indian government, and her grandson Rishi during her final years.\n\n"}

It is the westernmost island in the Marshall Islands, approximately southeast of Enewetak, and approximately west of the main Ralik Chain.\n\nUjelang's first European visitor was Álvaro de Saavedra on 21 September 1529 shortly before his death, in his second attempt to return from Tidore to New Spain. Sighting of Ujelang was again recorded by the Spanish expeditions of Ruy López de Villalobos on 6 January 1543; of Miguel López de Legazpi on 15 January 1565; and by the mutineers of the \"San Jeronimo\" led by the pilot Lope Martín in 1566.\n\nIn 1811, the British merchant vessel \"Providence\" rediscovered the Atoll, and named Ujelang Island Providence Island. \"Providence\" had transported convicts from Britain to New South Wales and was on her way to China to pick up a cargo to take back to Britain.\n\nThe Empire of Germany claimed Ujelang Atoll along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1884. It was the private property of German trading companies from 1880, who maintained copra plantations on the largest island, also called Ujelang. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. In 1935 there were only some 40 inhabitants.\n\nDuring World War II, the island was occupied by the United States Army's Company I, 111th Infantry Regiment, which landed on 22 April 1944 and which used the island as a staging area before redeployment to Peleliu on 1 February 1945.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the island came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986. The island became a relocation center for the people of Enewetak Atoll in 1947 (due to atomic tests on that island from 1948–1958). The population on Ujelang grew from 145 in 1947 to 342 in 1973, despite near-famine and epidemics, especially in the 50s, due to the scarce supply of fish and vegetables. The inhabitants wanted to return to Enewetak and a highly publicized meeting was held at Ujelang in 1979 to discuss the issue. The United States government was represented by a variety of personnel, primarily Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Interior representatives. The DOE's legal counsel was William L. Brown. The meeting gained national attention because the CBS television show \"60 Minutes\" went along and publicized the islanders’ desire to return to Enewetak with an extended film segment that ran several times.\n\nThe clean-up of Enewetak was essentially done except for several areas which were declared unsafe for human habitation until 2010. Hundreds of new coconut trees were planted and vast amounts of sediment and other material contaminated by radioactivity were entombed under a giant concrete dome. The next year, in 1980, all Ujelang inhabitants were returned to Enewetak. A hundred or so soon returned to Ujelang because Enewetak could not support so many people, but their stay on Ujelang was short-lived. In 1989 Ujelang became permanently uninhabited. Ujelang Atoll is currently owned by the Enewetak Council and is now very rarely visited.\n\n\n\n"}

The town is above sea level on the confluence of the Barron River, Granite Creek and Emerald Creek. Between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Tablelands Region. The town's name is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning \"meeting of the waters\".\n\nPrior to European settlement, the area around Mareeba was inhabited by the Muluridji people. They maintained a hunter/gatherer existence in the area between Mount Carbine, Mareeba, Rumula (near Julatten) and Woodville (near Canoona), mainly concentrated between Biboohra and Mount Molloy. In the local Aboriginal language, Mareeba means meeting of the waters - referring to the point at which the Barron River is joined by Granite Creek.\n\nOn 26 May 1875 James Venture Mulligan became the first European officially to see the future site of Mareeba when he rode up the eastern bank of the Barron River, and passed the junctions of Emerald Creek and Granite Creek.\n\nThe Mareeba area was first settled by Europeans in 1877 by John Atherton, who arrived with cattle at Emerald End, which is just north of the town today. Mareeba quickly became a busy coach stop for Cobb & Co on the road from Port Douglas to Herberton. When the railway arrived in 1893, Mareeba grew into a busy town.\n\nMareeba Post Office opened on 25 August 1893 (a receiving office named Granite Creek had been open from 1891).

As long as Antiochus was engaged in the war with Ptolemy, he would not march against Achaeus; but upon the conclusion of a treaty with Ptolemy, he crossed the Taurus, uniting his forces with Attalus, and in one campaign deprived Achaeus of his dominions and took Sardis (with the exception of the citadel).

They are only found in Africa. \nThere is another African ground squirrel of the genus \"Atlantoxerus\", the \"Atlantoxerus getulus\" present in southwestern Morocco and northern Western Sahara. It is invasive in the Canary Islands since an introduction in 1971.\n\nThere are four species of African ground squirrels divided into three subgenera:\n\nThe squirrels live in open woodlands, grasslands, or rocky country. They are diurnal and terrestrial, living in burrows. Their diet is roots, seeds, fruits, pods, grains, insects, small vertebrates and bird eggs. They live in colonies similar to North American prairie dogs, and have similar behavior. If kept as pets, they run free as house cats do, otherwise farmers consider them pests. Breeding in South African ground squirrels is asynchronous and there is no specific period of breeding although very few litters are seen above the ground in the months of July to October. Gestation period lasts for 48 days and the young ones are weaned after 52 days. There are one to three babies per litter. A female becomes sexually mature when she is 10 months old and a male matures at the age of 8 months. Although a female has the capability to breed throughout the year, less than 10% reproduce more than one litter in a year.\n\nThe South African ground squirrel does not hibernate. These squirrels are very social and live in groups with about 1 to 3 females and 2 to 3 males. Sometimes, the number of males can exceed up to 9 with some sub-adult females. An interesting thing about this breed is that mature males like to form their own groups and there can be 19 to 20 individuals in one group. These groups are called bands.\n\nTheir home range is shared with other groups which is actually quite a surprising thing, since in case of most of the mammals there is generally an extremely tough competition to get the female. The group-living instinct of this species gives it a survival opportunity from predators overweighing the disadvantage of breeding opportunities which come from competition.\n\n"}

It was eventually granted the status of a Roman colony and made the capital of the province of Mauretania Tingitana and, after Diocletian's reforms, the diocese of Hispania.\n\nThe Greeks later claimed that Tingis had been named for a daughter of the titan Atlas, who was supposed to support the vault of heaven nearby. They claimed that the Berber legends comported with the stories of Hercules's labors, which carried him to North Africa and the North Atlantic to retrieve the of the Hesperides. Having killed her husband Antaeus and again condemned her father to eternally supporting the firmament, Hercules slept with Tinja and fathered the Berber hero Syphax. Syphax supposedly founded the port of Tingis and named it his mother's honor after her death. The gigantic skeleton and tomb of Antaeus were tourist attractions for ancient visitors. The Caves of Hercules, where he supposedly rested on Cape Spartel, remain one today.\n\nTingis was founded in the early 5th centuryBC by Carthaginian colonists, who variously recorded the name of their settlement as (), (), and (). The town is sometimes connected to the voyages of Hanno the Navigator.\n\nAfter the Punic Wars, Carthage lost control of the colony to the Roman-allied kings of Mauretania. Its name during this time appears in Greek and Roman sources variously as Tenga, Tinga, Titga, &c. It maintained strong ties to its Carthaginian heritage, issuing bronze coins with Punic legends reading \"City of Titga\" (, ), \"City of Tinga\" (, ), or \"people of Tinga\" (, ). These bore Baal or (via interpretatio Graeca) Demeter's head obverse and wheat reverse.\n\nThe town came under Roman rule in the 1st century. Q.Sertorius, took and held Tingis for a number of years in the 70sBC as part of his war against Sulla's regime in Rome. Tingis grew in importance as a free city under Augustus and then as a colony under Claudius, who made it the capital of Mauritania Tingitana. As a Roman colony, it bore the formal name , the \"Julian colony of Tingis\". Under the early empire, it began to use Latin script, issuing its bronze coins with the legend ; these bore Augustus and Agrippa's heads obverse and Baal's head reverse.\n\nAs a provincial capital, Tingis developed and prospered. In the 4th century, it surpassed Volubilis when that city was left south of the Roman lines and unprotected by Roman legions. Tingis at its peak reached 20,000 inhabitants, all thoroughly romanized and mostly Christian. Tingis was famed throughout the Roman Empire for its fishing conserve industry. Under Septimius Severus, two Roman roads were constructed from Tingis: one on the Atlantic coast to Sala Colonia and the second into the mountainous interior toward Volubilis.\n\nDuring Diocletian's reform of Roman governmental structures in 296, Mauretania Tingitana became part of the Diocese of Hispania. Tingis remained the capital of the larger territory, maintaining its status and development.\n\nThe Vandals conquered and occupied Tingis around 425 before sweeping across the Roman Maghreb.\n\nBetween 534 and 682, Tingis was restored to Byzantine control. Tingis was fortified and a new church erected. However, its commercial strength had waned, a change attested by its decreased issuance of coins.\n\nTingis fell under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate as part of the Muslim conquest of North Africa in 702, after which it was reduced to a small town more commonly discussed under the name Tangier. Moussa Ibn Noussair organized the conquest of Spain from Tingis and nearby Septem in 706.\n\nThe Christian history of Tingis started during the second half of the first century, under Claudius's rule. Originally, the city was part of the larger province of Mauretania Caesariensis, which included most of the Roman Maghreb. Later the area was subdivided, with the eastern part keeping the former name and the newer part receiving the name of Mauretania Tingitana. It is not known exactly at what period there may have been an episcopal see at Tangier in ancient times, but in the late Middle Ages Tangier was a titular see (i.e., an honorific fiction for the appointment of curial and auxiliary bishops). For the historical reasons given above, one official list of the Roman Curia places the see in Mauretania Caesariensis.\n\nTowards the end of the third century, Tingis was the scene of the martyrdom of StMarcellus, mentioned in the Roman Martyrology on 30 October, and of St.Cassian, mentioned on 3 December. Indeed, according to tradition, the martyrdom of StMarcellus took place on 28 July 298. \n\nA small Christian community survived in Tangier as late as the 10th century. Due to its Christian past, Tangierunder the name Tingisis still a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\n"}

A student of Ernst Haeckel, he graduated from the University of Jena in 1885 with a Ph.D.; he had also studied at the University of Kiel and the University of Strasbourg. From 1886 on, he worked as an instructor at the University of Strasbourg. Together with Haeckel, he participated in an expedition to Zanzibar in 1890/91. Three years later, he emigrated to the United States, where he got a post as the curator of the department of invertebrate paleontology at Princeton University. In 1899, he participated in the Peary Relief expedition, and one year later, he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn 1903, he moved to Pittsburgh. He became the curator of invertebrate zoology at the Carnegie Museum and from 1910 on, he was professor of physical geography at the University of Pittsburgh, where he also obtained in 1911 the additional degree of an Sc.D.

(There have been slight differences in the way Dravidian languages are grouped by various Dravidian linguists: See Subrahmanyam 1983, Zvelebil 1990, Krishnamurthi 2003). Tamil–Kannada itself is designated as a branch of the South Dravidian I subfamily and in turn branches off into Tamil–Kodagu and Kannada–Badaga. The languages that constitute the Tamil–Kannada branch are Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Irula, Toda, Kota, Kodava, and Badaga. (Zvelebil 1990:56)\nAccording to R. C. Hiremath, Director of International School of Dravidian Linguistics in Trivandrum, the separation of Tamil and Kannada into independent languages from the Tamil–Kannada inner branch started with the separation of Tulu in about 1500 BCE and completed in about 300 BCE.\n\nKannada, Tamil and Malayalam are recognized among the official languages of India and are spoken mainly in South India. All three are officially recognized as classical languages by the Government of India, along with Sanskrit, Telugu, and Odia.\n\nTamil and Malayalam have both retroflex lateral (/ɭ/) and retroflex approximant (/ɻ/) sounds, whereas Kannada has retained only the retroflex lateral. Evidence shows that both retroflex fricative and the retroflex laterals were once (before the 10th century) also present in Kannada. However, all the retroflex approximants changed into retroflex laterals in Kannada later. In Kannada, the bilabial voiceless plosive (/p/) at the beginning of many words has disappeared to produce a velar fricative (/h/) or has disappeared completely. This change is unique to Kannada in the Dravidian family. Tamil does not show this change.\n\nTamil and Telugu show the conversion of velar plosives (/k/) into palatal plosives at the beginning of the words (refer to comparative method for details). Kannada, however, is totally inert to this change and hence the velar plosives are retained as such or with minimum changes in the corresponding words.\n\n"}

It was the first time that the four original members of Kiss did not all appear together for the entire album.\n\nThe album and the following tour were billed as the \"Return of Kiss\". Kiss had not released a studio album since \"Love Gun\" in 1977. Instead, the band released their second live album, \"Alive II\", and each member had recorded eponymous solo albums, which were simultaneously released on September 18, 1978.\n\nAfter pre-production and rehearsals were completed, Vini Poncia (who had produced \"Peter Criss\"), decided that Criss' drumming was substandard, an opinion shared by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. Criss was hindered by injuries to his hands that he had suffered in a 1978 car accident. Kiss hired the South African-born studio drummer Anton Fig, who played on \"Ace Frehley\", to play on the \"Dynasty\" sessions. \"On \"Dynasty\", Peter was pretty much out of commission,\" reflected Stanley, \"so I wouldn't point to it as a classic Kiss album.\" With the exception of his song \"Dirty Livin'\", a rewrite of a song of the same title demoed during his pre-Kiss days in Lips, Criss does not appear on the album, and he did not perform on another Kiss album until \"Psycho Circus\" in 1998, on which he again only played on one song. Fig was again hired to replace Criss during recording sessions for the following album, \"Unmasked\". Eric Carr was hired as Criss' permanent replacement before the Unmasked Tour began.\n\nFrehley, who himself left the band three years later, sings three songs on \"Dynasty\": \"Hard Times\", \"Save Your Love\" and a cover version of the Rolling Stones' song \"2000 Man\". Although he had frequently sung backing vocals and had written the Kiss classics \"Cold Gin\" and \"Parasite\", Frehley had only previously been lead singer on his songs \"Shock Me\" on \"Love Gun\", and \"Rocket Ride\" on the studio side of \"Alive II\", as he lacked confidence in his ability as a lead singer.\n\nStanley's \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" was one of the band's most successful singles, peaking at #11 on the American singles chart. He also sang on \"Sure Know Something\" and \"Magic Touch\". In contrast, Simmons sings lead vocals on only two songs, \"Charisma\" (which became a minor hit in Mexico) and \"X-Ray Eyes\".\n\nThe album includes a colorful jacket cover which is actually a collage of photos taken from the photo session and not a group shot as it appears. The label shows a portrait of all four members instead of the usual Casablanca label. Inserts included a merchandise order form and a full-color poster.\n\nThe Dynasty Tour ran in the second half of 1979 and was Kiss' most expensive. It was their first tour since the \"Alive II\" tour ended on April 2, 1978, in Japan. Kiss sported new costumes with colors that coincided with the colors of their respective solo albums: purple (Stanley), red (Simmons), blue (Frehley) and green (Criss).\n\nThe new production had Simmons being hoisted to a small stage atop the scaffolding during his bass guitar solo (typically played before \"God of Thunder\"). The harness malfunctioned on several occasions. Frehley was similarly elevated for his guitar solo and the tour was the first to feature his \"light-guitar\" and his rocket-shooting stunt. A trick was designed for Stanley that involved him putting on a headset and shooting a laser out of his right eye (to mock the effect seen in \"Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park\" a year before). After several run-throughs both Stanley and Bill Aucoin canceled the idea, citing the danger involved to both him and the fans.\n\nThe tour saw a decline in audience. Shows at Madison Square Garden and the Pontiac Silverdome were canceled, while an additional night at the Los Angeles Forum was moved to the 10,000-capacity Anaheim Convention Center. The last concert with all the original members took place at the Toledo Sports Arena, in Toledo, Ohio, on December 16, 1979. The tour was considered a financial failure, and it became the final tour with the original band until the 1996 Reunion Tour sixteen years later.\n\n\n"}

During her career, she was an uneven bars and balance beam specialist.\n\nLi Ya has two moves named after her in the Code of Points: the \"Li Ya salto\", which is a straddled Jaeger ½ release (which she usually connected to a straddled Jaeger), and the \"Li Ya dismount\", which is an Arabian double-front in a piked position. Li retired from the national team in 2008.\n\nLi Ya is the 2004 National Champion on the uneven bars as well as the 2004 National All Around Silver Medalist. She had a great deal of success in the 2004 World Cup Circuit despite a bad showing at the 2004 Olympics. In the team final in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens she fell twice on beam scoring an 8.300 (once on her front flip and then underrotated on her double back dismount and put her hands down). Then in the event finals, she fell again on her front flip and scored a 9.050 (ranking 7th). She won the uneven bars title at the Glasgow and Ghent World Cup Qualifiers. She also won a bronze medal at the 2004 Glasgow World Cup Qualifier. In December 2004 Li Ya qualified to the World Cup Final in Birmingham. She was the most successful Chinese female gymnast at the World Cup Final.

A few weeks later, she was part of China's winning team at the East Asia Games in Macau, where she also won a gold medal on the uneven bars. She was not selected for the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne.\n\nShe competed in the 2006 Tournament of Masters in Cottbus, a world cup event, and won the gold medal on the uneven bars. In this event, she pioneered a difficult release-release combination, a Jaeger with a half turn directly into a Jaeger. The Jaegar with 1/2 turn release was later named for her. Li also qualified for the beam final and finished in fourth place, due to a mistake on her first skill.\n\nShe competed at the 2006 World Championships in Aarhus, Denmark where she was a member of the Chinese team that won the gold medal in the women's team event. She did not compete in the team final, having withdrawn from the uneven bars due to nerves sustained from a performance marred by a fall in the preliminary competition.\n\nAfter this competition, Li Ya did not receive positive coverage from the press in China and was not named to the team for the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar. However, she had one more chance, having qualified for bars and beam in the World Cup Finals in Brazil, held in December. She hit her routines at this competition, winning silver on bars behind world champion Beth Tweddle, and winning gold on the balance beam.\n\nIn 2007, Li Ya competed in the Maribor World Cup where she placed 2nd on balance beam and 1st on the uneven bars.\n\nShe announced her retirement in 2008.\n\n"}

It was unveiled on 12 November 1994 as the result of a joint venture between Proton and Diversified Resources Bhd. (DRB), and was first imported to Europe during 1995. The Proton Satria was produced at Automotive Manufacturers Malaysia's (AMM) plant in Pekan, Pahang and was initially distributed by Usahasama Proton-DRB (USPD), a company in which Proton held a 30% stake in late 1994.\n\nIn Australia, the Satira was launched in 1997 with 3 variants oringally on offered: 1.5 GL, 1.5 GLi and 1.6 XLi. All three variants was fuel injected.\n\nThe Proton Satria was initially available in three variants at launch with two engine options, namely the old 12-valve carburetted 1.3-litre 4G13P unit from the Proton Saga and a newer 16-valve multipoint fuel injected 1.6-litre 4G92P unit. The old 12-valve carburetted 1.5-litre 4G15P, also from the Proton Saga was added to the range later in the Satria's production cycle. The 1.5 and 1.6-litre engines were fitted with either a 3-speed or 4-speed automatic transmission, and a 5-speed manual transmission was offered with all three engine configurations. On the exterior, the Proton Satria shared the vast majority of its front-end styling and interior parts and components with the Proton Wira, but the rear-end was left largely unchanged over the Mirage / Colt it was based on. The Proton Satria had a development cost of RM150 million in late 1994, and it was priced between RM38,000 and RM54,000 at launch.\n\nTrim levels were LSi, GLi, GLSi and SEi. The base-specification LSi had the 1.3-litre 12-valve engine only: GLi versions got the 1.5-litre 12-valve engine in addition to the 1.3-litre: whilst GLSi and SEi versions got the 1.6 16v engine as well as the 1.5 12v.\n\nA later facelift version featured a redesigned rear end, different from that of the original Mirage. These were launched in 1996 in Malaysia and later in other countries, and new XLi, S XLi and GTi trim levels were available. New 1.3 12v, 1.5 12v, and 1.6 16v petrol engines were available.\n\nIn 2004 in Malaysia, the Satria Special Edition was launched. Three variants were offered: 1.3 GL M/T, 1.5 GL M/T and 1.5 GL A/T. No mechanical change compared to regular Satria's. Rather changes were mostly cosmetic that included the headlights internal casing painted black, an addition of an engine cover, hollow race style headrests for the front seats, revised metre graphics, gunmetal finish for the dashboard centre cluster, aluminum pedal, and a yellow gear shifter base.\nThe Proton Satria GTi was launched in 1998 with a 1.8-litre Mitsubishi-sourced 4G93P engine (\"P\" for Proton), originally found in the Mitsubishi Lancer GSR, but here without the turbo and with an increase in compression to compensate. The Satria GTi was developed and re-engineered as a traditional hot hatch by Lotus in Hethel, England. The Satria GTi could sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds, making it among the fastest Proton production models ever produced. A new body kit was also adopted for better aerodynamics. The Satria GTi also wore a 'Handling by Lotus' badge on the rear hatch.\n\nThe engine and handling of the Satria GTi were progressively updated and revised between 1998 and 2005. The Mitsubishi version was produced from 1998 until mid-2002. The VDO (Siemens) version had been in production from mid-2002 until 2005 when Proton ceased production.\n\nThe Proton Satria GTi launched in the United Kingdom in November 1999 with a £14,500 price tag. It was equipped with air-conditioning, ABS, dual front power windows, electric mirrors and Recaro seats. Proton sold 160 units of the Satria GTi within its first six months in the U.K.\n\nRichard Hammond had reviewed the Proton Satria GTi alongside the more established Peugeot 206 GTi. The Satria GTi received more praise and approval as a traditional hot hatch, despite costing £500 more than the 206 GTi.\n\nA concept Proton Cabriolet was shown at the 1997 Frankfurt International Motor Show, with ambitions for sales in the UK from 1999 but this did not happen. \n\nThe Proton Satria R3 is a limited edition Satria sold in Malaysia. It was officially soft-launched on 4 October 2004, then made available for booking on 17 October 2004. The term R3 stands for Race, Rally, Research. R3 is a redefined version of the Satria GTi by Proton's Racing development team in collaboration with Lotus. It houses the same 1800 cc Mitsubishi 4G93P engine but has undergone some minor adjustments by Lotus handling. The body shell has been improved with double stitch welded monocoque chassis with front and rear strut tower brace bars. Body weight has been lightened as well. It comes with Recaro SR4 semi-bucket seats, both Momo steering wheel and gear knob.\n\nThe Proton Satria Neo was introduced in June 2006 as a replacement for the first generation Satria. Based on a new platform developed in-house by Proton (with some parts borrowed from the bigger Gen-2 and Waja), the car is currently only available in a three-door hatchback guise. The car was developed at a cost of RM500 million and four years, and was expected by Proton to generate a monthly sales volume of 2,000 - 2,500 units. The car was also intended to target those who are \"youthful and sporty\". The Satria Neo was launched by former Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. The Satria Neo is also the only Proton car to be sold in Japan.\n\nThe entry-level Satria Neo, the 1.3 B-line, is powered by a 1.3-litre, inline-four twin-cam Campro engine, producing at 6,000 rpm and 120 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. The 1.6 M-line and top-of-the-range H-line models have 1.6 litre versions of the same engine, with an output of at 6,000 rpm and 148 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. Both the M-line and H-line models have active system antennae which actively search for signals in areas with poor reception. All cars have the option of either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic gearboxes supplied by Mitsubishi that are carried over from the previous Satria, with the H-line benefiting from safety features such as twin airbags, ABS with EBD and seatbelt pre-tensioners. All versions of the car come with an integrated Blaupunkt CD player.\n\nIn February 2009, Proton launched a CPS version of the Satria Neo, replacing the high-end H-Line version of the Satria Neo. It comes with an aggressively styled body kit and spoiler that pays homage to the Satria GTi. It is powered by a 1.6-litre CamPro CPS engine with and of torque which reportedly does not suffer from the torque dip of older CamPro engines; however, the timing of the cam profile switching mechanism is slightly modified for aggressive driving – the CPS mechanism in the Satria Neo CPS changes from low cam to high cam at 4,400 rpm rather than at 3,800 rpm as in the other CPS-equipped models such as the Proton Waja and Proton Gen-2, as well as the Proton Exora.\n\nAs a successor to the original Satria R3, Proton introduced a high performance version of the Satria Neo in 2008. It features a naturally aspired 1.6-litre engine producing or , which Proton says will deliver a \"controlled yet exciting driving experience\". Other upgrades include a sportier bodykit, 17-inch wheels, a lowered suspension setup derived from Lotus, an improved braking system, Recaro lightweight seats and a MOMO steering wheel. All of the 50 examples produced come in Incognito Black with a unique \"Race, Rally Research\" decal on the side.\n\nThe 25 unit-only Satria Neo R3 Lotus Racing was introduced on the 30 March 2010. Sold at RM115,000 this special version of the Neo features some improvements over its sibling, the Satria Neo CPS. The look is similar to that of the Satria Neo R3, but includes some exclusive equipment. The engine is R3-tuned with R3 Engine Management System, R3 Camshafts with adjustable alloy cams and R3 tuned exhaust system. R3 Division also used an R3 Carbon Fibre Air Intake with K&N Air Filter System.\n\nThe engine now produces , approximately 13.8 percent more power than a normal CamPro CPS. with an improved torque of . Top speed reaches and the century run is achieved in 12.2 seconds.\n\nThe gear ratios were also revised to match the engine upgrade.\n\nThe chassis and handling were improved with the use of Ohlins Adjustable coilovers. The wheels are 16-inch Advantis with Bridgestone Adrenalin tyres. The brakes are from AP Racing consisting of AP Racing calipers and pads.\n\nInterior-wise, the dash remains the same but it is now painted in a greenish accent to match Lotus' green Trademark. Few enhancements were put in place such as the engine start button, dark green Nappa leather and an alloy pedal set and gear knob.\n\nIn continuation of the legacy of the Satria Neo R3 Lotus Racing, Proton introduced the 2011 R3 Satria Neo on 8 February 2011. Available only in bright red, it costed RM79,797.00 and featured a built-in 2-DIN navigation system, the first in Proton's history. It was fitted with the old Satria Neo CPS bodykit mated to new R3 Design 16-inch alloy rims, R3 front and rear spoilers and side mouldings in addition to leather upholstery and various other R3 extras on the interior. Its handling and performance attributes remained unchanged over its Lotus Racing sibling.\n\nPrior to its launch, the concept model for the 2011 Proton Satria Neo R3 was debuted during the Tokyo Auto Salon 2011.\n\nProton launched the 2013 Satria Neo R3 on 29 November 2012.\n\nIt is technically identical performance-wise to the Satria Neo CPS, but features the 2011 Satria Neo R3 bodykit and a significantly reduced price tag, costing between RM60,800 and RM64,250.\n\nThe roof of the 2013 Satria Neo R3 is painted according to the body colour. This differentiates it from the 2011 Satria Neo R3 which had a black roof. Optional decals and performance equipment such as ECU upgrades and full exhaust systems were also made available by Proton.\n\nThe 2013 Satria Neo R3 is fitted with dual airbags, ABS with EBD and is offered in manual and auto transmissions with a choice of 3 colours.\n\nProton Motorsports' British based partner Mellors Elliot Motorsports (MEM) has prepared a FIA Super 2000 compliant Proton Satria Neo based on the road car's chassis. It is powered by the same engine as found in the Proton Waja 1.8. The team's current drivers in 2011 on the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC), starting with the Rally Monte Carlo is Chris Atkinson. He will contest on all six rounds of the 2011 Asia Pacific Rally Championship (APRC) and Per-Gunnar Andersson who drives the second car for the Proton team in the IRC events, while Alister McRae will continue to drive for Proton in the APRC. McRae took the car to its first drivers and constructors titles in the 2011 APRC.\n\nA pair of Proton Satria Neo S2000s were used in an episode of Top Gear, in a race between the British presenters and their Australian counterparts at Cornbury Park, a former Rally GB venue.\n\nProton made its presence felt for the very first time in Japan when renowned Japanese automotive parts manufacturer Carrosser Co., Ltd. (CUSCO) officially unveiled at the Tokyo Auto Salon, a specially-developed Satria Neo rally car that will be sold in Japan. In January 2011, Proton announced that Japanese auto parts company CUSCO would be buying standard road-going Satria Neo body shells to engineer and homologate according to FIA Group N regulation competition use.\n\nThe Group N Proton Satria Neo rally cars will be based on stock standard road-registered 1600cc showroom models acquired by CUSCO, homologated according to FIA regulations for competition use, and retrofitted with CUSCO-developed aftermarket performance and race components. With the Satria Neo, CUSCO is essentially Proton's customer – they buy the body shells, equip them with CUSCO-developed race components, and then sell the completed Group N rally-going Neos to customers who will compete in Junior Rally Championships in Japan and Asia Pacific.\n\nVeteran Malaysian rally driver, Karamjit Singh piloted a CUSCO-tuned Proton Satria Neo 2WD in which he crossed the line to finish first in the overall 2011 APRC 2WD category on May 2011 Rally of Queensland as well as first in the N2 category.\n\nThree Satria Neos were fielded in the 2011 Japan Rally Championship in JN-3, one unit for the CUSCO Team and two for the CUSCO Junior Rally Team respectively. The latter finished with a class win in Rally Hokkaido 2011. In the 2012 season, only the Junior Rally Team drove the Satria Neos, whereas the CUSCO Team had replaced their unit with a Toyota 86.\n\n"}
{"id": "2232393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232393", "title": "GWR 4300 Class", "text": "GWR 4300 Class\n\nThe Great Western Railway (GWR) 4300 Class is a class of 2-6-0 (mogul) steam locomotives, designed by G.J. Churchward for mixed traffic duties. Three hundred and forty two examples were built from 1911–1932.\n\nIn 1906 Churchward fitted a more powerful Standard No. 4 boiler to his successful 3100 Class 2-6-2T to create the GWR 3150 Class. These showed themselves to be successful locomotives but their weight and water capacity meant that they tended to be restricted to suburban passenger traffic. Churchward was looking forward to the replacement of various of his predecessor’s 4-4-0 classes on secondary duties. In 1911 he therefore designed a tender version of the 3150 class which would be suitable for a wide range of intermediate duties. \n\nThe class was ‘a total synthesis of standard parts, using the outside cylinders of the Saint, the wheels of ’31XX’ 2-6-2 tank and the No. 4 boiler, in its superheated form.’ No prototype was required as the fundamental design had proved itself.\n\nThe locomotives quickly proved themselves to be so useful that they were produced more or less continuously in a series of batches (or lots) over a twelve year period (1911–1923), sometimes incorporating detailed differences. Two further lots were built in 1925 and 1932 by Churchward's successor, Charles Collett. \nThe first twenty examples, numbered 4301-20, were delivered by Swindon Works between June and October 1911. These had inside steam pipes, and were among the first GWR locomotives to be fitted with top feed apparatus. Nos. 4311–20 had boilers designed to operate at pressure but only 4315 and possibly 4316 ever worked at that pressure.\n\nThree further batches, totalling a further forty locomotives (4321–4360) were built at Swindon and delivered June 1913 and May 1914, before the onset of the First World War impeded further production. These locomotives (and all subsequent examples had frames lengthened by at the rear to give better access for maintenance as well as providing more room in the cab.\n\nThe class proved to be ‘just the type that was needed during the 1914–18 war and were accordingly built in considerable numbers during that period.’ Six batches, totalling one hundred locomotives (numbered 4361–4399, 4300, 5300–5359) were built between May 1915 and September 1918, and a further ten (5360–5369) between January and June 1919. From 1917 detailed changes were made to the design giving better weight distribution between the wheels which were later applied to other members of the class \nEleven examples of the class were transported to France during World War I in the service of the Railway Operating Division of the British Army and these were 5319–5326 and 5328–5330. One survives in preservation.\n\nThe first three of these lots were for seventy locomotives built between June 1919 and July 1921 (Nos. 5370-99 and 6300-6341). Lot 216 was for a further 28 locomotives (6342–6369) but Swindon works was then unable to keep pace with the demand for them and only the first twenty were completed after delay, between March and December 1923. The remainder (6362-9 and 7320/1) were later built under lot 230 in 1925.\n6320 was converted to oil firing between 1947 and the equipment was removed in 1949.\n\nAs Swindon works could not keep pace an order was placed with Robert Stephenson and Company in 1921 for fifty locomotives (Nos. 6370–6399 and 7300–7319). The first 35 of these (Lot 218) were built by the company between April 1921 and January 1922. The remaining fifteen were built at Swindon from parts manufactured by RSH between November 1921 and January 1922. \nIn 1925 Nos. 7300–7304 were modified for better balance and had detail alterations.\n\nIn 1932, Collett built a further twenty examples (9300–9319) to a modified design with side window cabs, outside steam pipes and a screw reverse. He also extended the frames, increasing the weight to (), which placed them in the Red band of route availability. After passing into British Railways ownership, these locomotives were modified back to light buffer beam design and were renumbered 7322–7341 between 1956 and 1959.\n\nThe class were widely used in Devon and Cornwall where the track had many sharp curves. It was found that flange wear on the leading driving wheels became excessive as a result of these bends. In November and December 1927 additional weight was added to the front end of four examples so that the pony truck would be forced to impart more side thrust to the main frames on bends. These locomotives reverted to their original state, but between January and March 1928, 65 engines of 5300 series received additional weight on the pony truck, and 3000 was added to their running numbers, temporarily creating an ‘8300 Class’. However, the additional weight placed them in the Red category of route availability. From 1944 onwards there was a shortage of locomotives in the Blue category and so the additional weights were removed and the surviving locomotives resumed their original running numbers. The last to be returned to its original condition was 8393 in September 1948.\n\nThe 4300 Moguls were the maids of all work on the GWR network and later the Western Region of British Railways. Employing a Standard number 4 boiler and the support struts similar to those fitted to the '2800' class, the class very quickly earned an excellent reputation in its ability to handle most types of traffic, from local stopping goods to main line expresses. According to O.S. Nock they \"could handle the heavy goods work as well as the 'Aberdares' and could run up to 70 mph with passenger trains, in other words they were the ideal mixed traffic locomotive\".\n\nAlthough the class continued to be very useful and the final batch were still relatively new, 100 of the earlier examples were withdrawn between 1936 and 1939 and the wheels and motion of eighty were used for the Grange Class and twenty for Manor Class engines. It was intended to replace the whole class in this way but the advent of the Second World War in 1939 brought a temporary halt to withdrawals and the programme was never revived.\nFurther withdrawals resumed in 1948 under British Railways ownership, but the last six examples survived until 1964.\n\n\nOnly two examples have survived to preservation:\n\nNote: Loco numbers in bold mean their current number.\n5322 is the older of the two as it was built in 1917, during the Great War, at Swindon Works. It was sent, with several other members of the class, to France for hauling munitions and hospital trains. There it was painted in War Department livery and given the number ROD5322. Demobbed in 1919 at Chester it returned to the GWR fleet until it was withdrawn from service in April 1964. It was sent to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales. The first Barry locomotive to be subject to a preservation fund, it was the second locomotive to leave Woodham's: 5322 thus ended up as the sole early 43xx to be preserved. It was initially restored to working order, but was not steamed after 1975 until returning to steam in 2008 at the Didcot Railway Centre, restored to its 1919 War Department condition.\n\n9303 is one of the final batch of 342 locomotives built between 1911 and 1932. They were built with larger cabs and had a weight attached to the buffer beam to place more weight on the leading pony wheels. This was done to reduce the wear on the leading driving wheels. In 1958 the weight was removed from the buffer beam to give the locomotive more route availability. At the same time it was renumbered 7325.\n\nAn engine similar to the 4300 class was rebuilt from 5193 (a GWR 5101 Class 2-6-2T) to become a smaller boilered version of the class numbered 9351.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2232427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232427", "title": "Suzuki Jimny", "text": "Suzuki Jimny\n\nThe is a line of four-wheel drive off-road mini SUVs, made by Japanese automaker Suzuki since 1970. Originated as a car in the Japanese Kei car (\"light automobile\") tax and legal class – a Kei car version is still made for the Japanese market today, as well as versions that exceed that class's legal limits, in Japan called the Jimny Sierra. The latter are also successfully sold in worldwide markets. Suzuki has sold 2.85 million of them in 194 countries from launch in April 1970 through September 2018.\n\nThe history of Suzuki four-wheel drive cars dates to 1968. Suzuki bought former Japanese automaker Hope Motor Company, which had introduced 15 small, off-road vehicles called the HopeStar ON360. The first Suzuki-branded four-wheel drive, the LJ10 (Light Jeep 10), was introduced in 1970. The LJ10 had a 359-cc, air-cooled, two-stroke, in-line two-cylinder engine. The liquid-cooled LJ20 was introduced in 1972 with the cooling changed due to newly enacted emission regulations, and it gained 3 hp. In 1975, Suzuki complemented the LJ20 with the LJ50, which had a larger 539-cc, two-stroke, in-line three-cylinder engine and bigger differentials. This was originally targeted at the Australian market, but more exports soon followed.\n\nThe Jimny8/LJ80 was an updated version of the LJ50 with an 800-cc, four-stroke, in-line four-cylinder engine, followed by the Jimny 1000/SJ410 and Jimny 1300/SJ413. An updated version of the SJ413 became known as the Samurai and was the first Suzuki officially marketed in the US. The series from SJ410 to SJ413 was known as the Sierra in Australia, and remained the Jimny in some markets.\n\nThe new Jimny was released in 1998, and now bears the same name in all markets. The 1998 release used the G13BB EFI engine, replaced by the M13AA EFI engine in 2001 and the M13AA variable valve timing engine in 2005, in conjunction with a minor interior redesign.\n\nUnlike with many other vehicle name brands, where different generations of a certain vehicle name share little in common except the name itself, Suzuki has kept the main vehicle design characteristics common across all four Jimny generations.\n\nThose main characteristics concern the design of the main vehicle structure, suspension and transmission.\n\nAll four Jimny generations have separate frame and body (\"ladder frame chassis\"). The body has no structural carrying role. It serves only as a cabin to protect the occupants from the elements, provide comfort and protect them in the case of a crash.\n\nAll four Jimny generations have dependent suspension (solid / beam axles) both at the front axle and at the rear axle. This used to be a common suspension design for all terrain vehicles up to 1990s, but has become a rarity in vehicle design in the 21st century. Dependent suspension is particularly well suited for all terrain duty, both from the durability and performance perspectives.\n\nFirst two Jimny generations used leaf-sprung suspension at all four wheels, with the 3rd and 4th generations using coil-sprung suspension at all four wheels. There is an exception where some late 2nd generation models had coil-sprung suspension as well (more info in dedicated sub-chapters).\n\nAll four Jimny generations have recirculating ball steering mechanism, which is particularly well suited for all terrain duty, but relatively imprecise on-road compared to modern rack-and-pinion steering construction.\nAll four Jimny generations have manually user selectable part-time four wheel drive transmission, where the default (on-road) transmission mode is 2WD RWD (two wheel drive, rear wheel drive). Rear wheel drive can never be disengaged. The user however can (dis)engage the front wheel drive (FWD) manually at any time under certain operating conditions. When FWD is also engaged, this provides 4WD.\nThere is no center (inter-axle) differential. This has a positive effect that at least two wheels, where each wheel is on a different axle, have to lose traction in order for the vehicle to lose traction when in 4WD transmission mode. However, the negative effect is that 4WD transmission mode must not be used on any surface which is not rather slippery, especially if having to steer. In other words, 4WD transmission mode should be used only on rather slippery surfaces, like snow, ice, mud, loose gravel, wet grass and sand. Wet asphalt, wet concrete and hard-packed gravel are not considered slippery enough. All this is irrelevant when not using 4WD transmission mode.\nAll four Jimny generations have manually user selectable dual-ratio (dual range) gearing mechanism. The two ratios / ranges are called \"high range\" (for regular on-road driving and light to moderate all-terrain driving) and \"low range\" (for moderate to hard all-terrain driving and for all-terrain towing). The overall transmission gearing ratio is exactly halved when the vehicle is in low range transmission mode. This has the effect of the vehicle moving approximately twice as slow but with double torque at the wheels in any transmission gear. For example, the 4th gear in low range behaves similar to the 2nd gear in high range, and 3rd gear in low range behaves similarly as \"1.5th gear\" in high range.\nThe transmission gearing range is selectable only when the vehicle is in 4WD transmission mode. Therefore, low range can not be used for on-road towing.\n\nThe (dis)engagement of 4WD transmission mode and the switch from one gearing range to another is performed by a dedicated transfer case mechanical unit, which is separate from the regular gear box unit. All four Jimny generations have a transfer case with an attached selection lever protruding in the cabin between the main gear box lever and the hand brake lever. The lever allows the user to select 2WD-H, 4WD-H or 4WD-L transmission modes at will. The only exception are later production years of 3rd generation Jimnys (more info in a dedicated chapter), which do not have a selection lever, but instead have servo-actuated mechanism which performs the same actions when invoked by the push of certain buttons in the cabin.\nThe vehicle was originally developed by the Hope Motor Company of Japan in 1967 and available as the HopeStar ON360 from April 1968. It used a Mitsubishi air-cooled, two-stroke ME24 engine which produced . The rear axle was sourced from the Mitsubishi Colt 1000 and wheels were sourced from the Mitsubishi Jeep. It was a very basic two-seater vehicle with no doors, but a sturdy four-wheel drive system allowed it to go off-road. Top speed was , 30 km/h (18.6 mph) in four-wheel drive mode. The tiny Hope company sold very few ON360s, possibly as few as 15, although 100 ME24 engines were purchased) and sold the design to Suzuki in 1968, after Mitsubishi declined to take over production.\n\nThe compact off-road capable Suzuki Jimny was Suzuki's first global success, lending it name recognition and a foothold in markets worldwide. The Jimny slotted into a hitherto unfilled gap in the market.\n\nSuzuki's first move on acquiring the rights to the ON360 was rebodying it and replacing the Mitsubishi engine with an air-cooled Suzuki \"FB\" two-cylinder two-stroke which produced . Since the new unit remained smaller than 360 cc, and Suzuki placed the spare tire inside the truck (making it a three-seater) to keep it under 3 m in overall length, it was classified as a kei car, conferring certain tax privileges and other benefits. When it was introduced in April 1970, it was the first four-wheel drive kei car to enter series production. The LJ10 Jimnys had 16-inch wheels, weighed , and had a top speed of . The engine was soon uprated to , but the claimed top speed remained unchanged.\n\nThe LJ was updated in May 1972 and renamed the LJ20. The grille bars were changed from horizontal to vertical for the LJ20. The engine was replaced with an updated, water-cooled unit (the L50), and its enabled the LJ to reach 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\nTowards the end of LJ20 production, a cleaner engine was introduced, a result of ever more stringent emissions regulations. Top speed was reported as , payload was ( for the Van version).\n\nThe LJ50 engine was first introduced in September 1975 for export only, with . For the home market, it first appeared in June 1976 as the Jimny 55 and reflected the changing kei car rules and stricter emissions standards. The three-cylinder engine remained a two-stroke; while power was reduced to , more low-end torque was on offer. The vehicle could now hit 60 mph (97 km/h), and the spare tire was relocated outside the rear door, allowing for a fourth seat. The SJ10 Jimny originally used the \"LJ50\" name in most export markets; this was changed to LJ55 with the introduction of the LJ80 to align the names.\n\nIn Australia, the LJ50S and LJ50V (van) were available as a softtop with soft doors and rear-mounted spare wheel or hardtop with full metal doors and external spare wheel through distributor M.W.-Suzuki (Melbourne) with and of torque. In May 1976, the low production LJ51P long-wheelbase pickup became available for some export markets. The home-market Jimny 550 received a facelift in 1977, introducing rear wheel arch metal flares and a bigger bonnet or hood with cooling slots above the radiator, while the export LJ50s were instead replaced by the LJ80 (same external modifications, but with the new four-stroke, four-cylinder, 800-cc engine fitted).\n\nThe final iteration of the original Jimny design was the 1977 Jimny 8, called LJ80 in certain export markets. It was originally intended to be marketed as the Eljot (\"Elliott\") in Germany, but copyright issues with Disney's \"Pete's Dragon\" movie made this impossible. While the SJ10 remained in production for the domestic kei category, the new SJ20 boasted a four-stroke SOHC four-cylinder F8A engine capable of around . The additional power and torque of this engine allowed the differential and gearing to be raised for better cruising and offroad performance, and the track was widened by . The LJ80V was also assembled in Indonesia, by P.T. Indo Mobil Utama in Jakarta.\n\nThe interior was also improved, with new seats and steering wheel. Metal doors became available for the first time in 1979, and a pickup truck model (LJ81) was available by April of that year, as well. The pickup, called \"Stockman\" in Australia, had a wheelbase (up by ) and was long, compared to the LJ80. The Jimny 8/LJ80 was retired in late 1981 with the introduction of the second-generation Jimny.\n\nThe Suzuki SJ30 began production in May 1981 in Hamamatsu, Japan. In Japan, it was sold as the Suzuki Jimny and was a kei car, produced with both 550 cc and 660 cc 3-cylinder engines. The SJ-Series received a bigger engine and was lengthened and widened for export purposes, where it was sold with a multitude of names: Suzuki SJ410/413, Suzuki Samurai, Suzuki Sierra, Suzuki Potohar (Pakistan), Suzuki (Thailand), Suzuki Katana (Indonesia), Chevrolet Samurai, Holden Drover (Australia) and Maruti Gypsy (India ).\n\nThe SJ30 Jimny 550 was mainly for Japanese domestic market consumption where it suited the Kei car category. Still powered by the LJ50 engine also used in its predecessor, the Jimny 550 was by a sizable margin the last two-stroke engine built in Japan. Production ended with the withdrawal of type approval in November 1987 in favor of its F5A-engined brother, the JA71. The two-stroke had been favored by Japanese off-roaders (and by Suzuki) due to its superior torque.\n\nThe SJ40 Jimny 1000 was introduced for 1982 to replace the LJ80 range. The Jimny 1000, sold as the Suzuki SJ410 in most export markets, used the F10A - a larger 1 litre version of the LJ's 0.8 liter four-cylinder engine. This engine produced and it had a top speed of . The Japanese market models claimed at 5,000 rpm. So that owners of 550 cc Jimnys would not be able to retrofit the larger, wider wheels of the Jimny 1000 to their cars, the Japanese ministry of transportation dictated that Suzuki fit wheels with a different bolt pattern.\n\nA four-speed manual transmission was standard, as were non-power assisted drum brakes front and rear. The SJ410 came as a half-door convertible, long-wheelbase pickup truck, two-door hardtop (called \"Van\" in Japan), raised-roof hardtop, and no-glass hardtop (panel van). In Japan, the pickup truck was intended as a bare-bones work vehicle and did not receive fender extensions, and had diagonal tires on black-painted steel wheels rather than the sportier wheels fitted to the regular Jimny. Maximum payload is . In the autumn of 1983 a covered long-wheelbase version was added for export markets.\n\nThe SJ410 was also produced in Spain by Santana Motors in their Linares, Jaén factory as of March 1985 and was sold as a domestic vehicle in Europe due to its over 60% native parts content, thereby evading limits on imports of Japanese-built automobiles. It was built only on the short wheelbase, as a two-door convertible and commercial, or with the three door wagon or van bodywork. Some later models of the SJ410 would switch to disk brakes in the front depending on the factory they were made at. In March 1990, Santana-built versions received the same chassis developments which turned the SJ413 into the Samurai; this version was sold as Samurai 1.0 where it was offered (\"Samurai Mil\" in Spain). Cooper Motor Corporation (CMC) of Nairobi, Kenya, also assembled the SJ410 in the mid-eighties.\n\nThe SJ410 was also assembled in Indonesia by Suzuki Indomobil Motor, where it was marketed with different names. The original version was marketed as Jimny, continuing from the previous LJ Jimny. The canvas soft-top model was marketed in fairly small numbers from 1983 until late 1985 as Jimny Sierra. In the late 1980s, responding to the introduction of higher taxes for vehicles with four-wheel-drive, Suzuki introduced a 4x2 version as the Katana. The first Jimnys (built until 1984) were low-roof, metal-bodied wagons. A higher-roofed model arrived in 1984 and continued to be built until about 1988. The Katana has an even higher roof than the Jimnys. Later, there were also 1.3-liter models sold in small numbers as the \"Jimny Samurai.\"\n\nAs of 1989, the Indonesian Katanas and Jimnys received square headlights. The rear-wheel drive Katana was also, surprisingly, used as a basis for an Indonesian-built, 1930s' style kit-car called the Marvia Classic. In 2005, Suzuki introduced the SJ413 spacecab pickup, which was imported from Thailand until 2007. Production of the second generation Jimny (and Katana) in Indonesia ended in 2005.\n\nThe Indian built SJ-410 has only ever been available in a long-wheelbase version. The Gypsy remains in production for the Indian Subcontinent market. The version still produced in India by Maruti Suzuki is the Maruti Gypsy King, using the sixteen valve, 1.3 liter G13 engine. The Gypsy King has proved popular with the Indian armed forces and police units.\n\nIn 2013 Suzuki New Zealand reintroduced the Suzuki SJ series into New Zealand badged as the Suzuki Farm Worker 4x4, although the Maruti badge can clearly be seen in the centre of the radiator grille. The vehicle is actually the leaf-sprung Suzuki Maruti Gypsy King MG413W, powered by the G13BB 1.3 litre 16 valve engine, producing at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm, mated to a five-speed, all synchromesh gearbox and a high/low 2wd/4wd transfer box. The Farm Worker is available in four slightly differing styles, two having a rear window and fibreglass bulkhead, and two having canvas roofs with foldable front windscreens, all based on the lwb platform and offering a maximum payload of 500 kg. As its name suggests the Farm Worker is intended for farm work only and is not able to be road registered due to the vehicle not meeting current crash protection regulations, although it does come with seat belts for the front two seats.\n\nJA51 1300\n\nIn 1984, the SJ was revamped with the launch of the SJ413 (internal model code JA51). The SJ413 included a larger 1.3 liter four-cylinder engine, 5-speed manual transmission and power brakes (disc brakes on the front and drum brakes on the rear) all around. The body and interior were also redesigned, with a new dashboard, seats, and grille. The SJ410 remained in production for various other markets with the old specifications. After the 1988 introduction of the Escudo, sales of the Jimny 1300 ended in Japan. The model returned to the Japanese market in May 1993, after a thorough update.\n\nSJ413 had the same track width as SJ410. As those two car models were relatively susceptible to a rollover, Suzuki introduced a wider edition of SJ413 around 1988, with its track widened by 10 cm. Wider track gave the vehicle more stability. This wider edition received the nameplate \"Samurai\". The difference in width is the only major difference between SJ413 and Samurai, apart from some minor cosmetic changes in the interior and the exterior.\n\nThe Samurai was also produced in a long wheel base (LWB) edition for certain markets, but still with three doors. That LWB edition still had only two rear seats (if fitted at all) for two rear passengers, and the rear passenger leg room was the same as in the standard SWB edition. The extended vehicle length only affected the boot/trunk space behind the rear seats, which was significantly larger in the LWB edition.\n\nThe SJ-Series Samurai was introduced to the United States (Puerto Rico (SJ-410) and Canada earlier) in 1985 for the 1986 model year. It was priced at $6200 and 47,000 were sold in its first year. It had a 1.3 liter, , 4-cylinder engine and was available as a convertible or a hardtop, and came with rear seats until 1994. The Suzuki Samurai became intensely popular within the serious 4WD community for its good off-road performance and reliability compared to other 4WDs of the time, outselling the Jeep Wrangler by two to one in 1987. This is due to the fact that while very compact and light, it is a real 4WD vehicle equipped with a transfer case, switchable 4WD and low range. Its lightness makes it a very nimble off-roader less prone to sinking in softer ground than heavier vehicles.\n\nThe 1988.5 model Samurai was re-tuned for better on-road use in the United States. This revision included softer suspension settings and a larger anti-roll bar to reduce body roll. A lower 5th gear (.865:1 vs the earlier .795:1) increased engine rpm and power on the highway, and improved dashboard and seats made the Samurai more comfortable.\n\nA new 1.3 liter four-cylinder engine with throttle-body fuel injection was introduced with in September 1991. The Samurai was supplemented in Canada and the United States markets in 1989 by the Suzuki Sidekick, which eventually replaced the Samurai in 1995. The rear seat was removed from 1994 and 1995 Samurai models with rear shoulder safety belts becoming mandatory, and the partial roll cage not having the required mounting provisions, unlike the larger Jeep Wrangler. Low sales and pending stricter safety legislation prompted the withdrawal of the Samurai from Canada and the United States markets after 1995.\n\nAn unfavorable 1988 review in \"Consumer Reports\" magazine said the Samurai was unsafe and prone to rollovers. In 1996, after investigating the CU's claims, Suzuki of North America sued the magazine's publisher, Consumers Union (CU), for libel. The suit resulted in an inconclusive settlement. CU agreed that it \"never intended to imply that the Samurai easily rolls over in routine driving conditions.\" CU and Suzuki made a joint statement, saying, \"CU and Suzuki disagree with respect to the validity\" of CU's tests and that \"Suzuki disputes the validity\" of the tests, while \"CU stands by its test protocol and findings.\"\n\nRickman Cars developed a GFRP-bodied copy of the Samurai called the Rickman Ranger. Strictly a rear-wheel-drive vehicle, it uses the underpinnings of a Mark II Ford Escort. It was produced in the UK as a kitcar and later in Russia by Avtokam. Rickman, and later the Lomax Company, produced over 1000 vehicles. Avtokam and later Velta produced around 150 further kits. The Velta plant went bankrupt in 2006. Rickman also made a camper version known as the Rancher.\n\n The SJ413/Samurai had a longer history in the rest of the world. Australian market JA51s were sold as either Suzuki Sierra or Holden Drover, while those built in Thailand are called Suzuki . The has also been available as the \" Sporty\", a unique LWB extended cab pickup.\n\nDue to various trade obstacles for Japanese cars, Spanish Santana Motors (in addition to the SJ410) began local production of the SJ413 in 1986. The Santana built SJs had softer springs for an improved on-road ride, color coordinated interiors with cloth seats and carpeted floors, all to broaden appeal to those who did not intend to primarily off-road the vehicle. In 1989 it received some optical as well as chassis updates and received the \"Samurai\" nameplate. Santana-built Samurais did not benefit from the updated coil sprung chassis introduced around 1996, instead receiving a facelift (new grille, more rounded bumpers) specific to European and neighboring markets. Also around 1998, Santana developed a version which used PSA's XUD 9 1.9-litre turbodiesel engine, producing . Top speed is 130 km/h (80.8 mph). Santana then replaced this diesel Samurai edition with another diesel edition sometime in year 2001, based on Renault's F8Q 1.9 litre non-turbo diesel engine, producing ). Santana also produced petrol editions alongside the diesel editions. Spanish Samurai production (both for petrol and for diesel editions) ended in late 2003 or early 2004.\n\nThe Samurai was sold in Colombia and Venezuela as Chevrolet Samurai, assembled in Bogotá, Colombia by General Motors Colmotores. In other South American markets (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay) it was sold as the Suzuki Samurai. Long wheelbase models were not offered in the Mercosur.\nIn Asia the SJ/Samurai was sold under a few different names. In Thailand it was called the Suzuki . The Thai market also received a special version called the \"Suzuki Sporty\", a pickup with an extended cab with a small rear seat best suited for occasional use.\n\nOn April 21, 2007, the Chilean duo of Gonzalo Bravo and Eduardo Canales drove their modified Suzuki Samurai (SJ413) up Ojos del Salado to an altitude of , setting a new record for the highest altitude attained by a four-wheeled vehicle, surpassing the previous record of set by a Jeep.\n\nThe Samurai in question benefited from wheel, tire, and suspension changes, and a supercharged G16A 4-cylinder engine. It was the third attempt for the two man team, after encountering weather difficulties on the first attempt and an engine fire in the second. The previous record holder's team led by Matthias Jeschke driving a Jeep Wrangler, left a sign reading \"Jeep Parking Only: All others don't make it up here anyway\". The Chilean team found the sign, blown down by strong winds, and brought it back to civilization as a souvenir.\n\nThis record was duly certified by the Guinness World Record in July 2007.\n\n In January 1986 the JA71, a four-stroke, turbocharged and fuel-injected (F5A) three-cylinder engine was introduced to complement the two-stroke SJ30. It used the upgraded interior from the Jimny 1300, which was simultaneously introduced to the SJ30. Power was (JIS gross), although this was increased to (JIS Net) in a November 1987 facelift by adding an intercooler. The non-intercooled engine continued to be offered in the lowest spec Van version. Claimed power was down to as the ratings were switched from gross to net. At the same time, a glassed high-roof version (\"Panoramic Roof\") was added.\n\nThe JA71 was replaced in March 1990 by the new JA11 as new Kei category regulations took effect. Now with 657 cc on offer, the otherwise similar F6A engine only came with an intercooler and . A utilitarian van (HA), as well as more luxurious Hardtop, Convertible, and Panoramic Roof (HC, CC, EC) versions were on offer. The suspension was also upgraded, while a longer front bumper meant that the foglights could be mounted in front of the grille rather than in it. In June 1991, power was increased to and a year later power steering and automatic transmission became available for the first time. Top speed of this version was . In February 1995 power increased to , but production of the JA11 ended only nine months later with the introduction of the coil spring JA12/22.\n\nThe Samurai continued for sale outside the United States (where the newer version is referred to as the 'Coily'), with a substantial update in November 1995. This included a coil spring suspension, though both live axles were retained. The rest of the truck was redesigned as well, with new seats, dashboard, steering wheel, doors and front grille joining a more \"macho\" exterior.\n\nCoil sprung Samurais are significantly more comfortable than leaf-sprung Samurais, mostly because of coil-sprung suspension. The new suspension design did not diminish vehicle's all-terrain capabilities.\nThere were three Samurai coil sprung models.\nAdditional notes:\nNot all production plants switched over to produce coil sprung Samurais. The most notable examples are Suzuki Maruti plant in India (still produces the original narrow SJ410 as of year 2020) and Santana plant in Spain (continued producing leaf-sprung Samurais until year 2004). While the third-generation Jimny replaced the Jimny/Samurai in most markets after 1998, it still remains in production in India.\n\nAt the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show, Suzuki presented the all-new Jimny with a much more modern design. A ladder type chassis and a dual-ratio transfer case were retained, unlike many competing compact 4WDs which lack a low range, and are strictly in the crossover category. Two versions are available in export markets: a standard hard top and the Canvas Top, introduced at the Barcelona Motor Show in May 1999 and was built only by Santana in Spain between 1999 and 2009. The Jimny replaced the popular Sierra/Samurai model in most markets (European introduction was in Paris, 1998), though its predecessor remains in limited production in some places. For the domestic market, a 660 cc K6A-engined version suited for the Kei Jidosha class is responsible for most Jimny sales.\n\nThe larger 1.3-litre Jimny was originally equipped with the G13BB engine also used in the JB32. The G13BB engine was replaced in Japan with the January 2000 introduction of the newly designed VVT 16-valve M-engine, but soldiered on in Spanish-built softtops until 2005. For the continental European market, where the diesel cars hold a significant market share, in 2004 the turbodiesel Jimny JB53 was introduced, built by Santana and using a Renault-built DDiS 1,461 cc K9K engine. Power was originally but was increased to in 2005, the same as in gasoline versions. It was discontinued in 2011, and was never available in Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe Jimny has a part-time 4WD system controlled by three dashboard buttons: 2WD, 4WD, and 4WD-L. The default is 2WD, powering the rear wheels. When 4WD is pressed, the front wheels are also engaged in high gear. The 4WD-L engages all wheels in a lower gear ratio. Being a part-time 4WD, there is no center differential or viscous coupling to allow for speed differences between the front and rear wheels, so only two-wheel drive mode works well on dry pavement. In Japan, the \"Sierra\" name was revived in January 2002, when 1.3-litre Jimnys began to be sold as the \"Jimny Sierra\" rather than as the \"Jimny Wide\".\n\nThe Jimny's vacuum-locking hubs allow it to be shifted from 2WD to 4WD while travelling at up to 100 km/h (62 mph). Shifting to low range requires the vehicle to be stopped, but no need to exit the vehicle exists. Newer Jimnys have electronic push-button selectable four-wheel drive, which requires the vehicle to be stopped with the clutch depressed and transmission in neutral to select low range.\n\nThe Jimny has large windows, giving excellent visibility, apart from a rather serious blind spot caused by the oversized \"B\" pillar. The large amount of glass also magnifies the greenhouse effect, and the Jimny comes with air conditioning standard in some regions.\n\nIn Europe, both Hard Top and Canvas Top versions come in JX and JLX specifications. These are fairly standard designations across the Suzuki off-road range, with the JLX being the fully optioned \"luxury\" version. In the case of the Jimny, the JLX adds roof rails, power steering, power windows, power-adjustable exterior mirrors, and several interior comfort improvements. Both models are available with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic gearbox. The 2WD option is only available as a five-speed manual.\n\nIn 2009, Santana Motor of Spain ended its agreement with Suzuki to make the Canvas Top version, which has not been available since then. In 2011, Santana Motor went bankrupt. The Souza Ramos Group of Brazil, which used to make Mitsubishi cars under license, will start manufacturing the Suzuki Jimny in 2012 in Brazil to compensate for the loss of production capacity from Santana Motor. Whether the Canvas Top version will be manufactured also in Brazil is not known.\n\nAs in Japan, Jimnys in Australia have borne the name Jimny Sierra since 2007, largely due to the Sierra name having become synonymous with small, capable off-road vehicles. Since 1999, GM Colmotores have been assembling the 1.3-litre, JB33 with the name \"Chevrolet Jimny\" in Bogotá, Colombia. The Jimny is also available as a parallel import in Singapore.\n\nIn 2012, for the 2013 model year, the Jimny received a front facelift, giving it a more angular grille and front bumper, and including a hood scoop. For the Indonesian market, the facelifted Jimny was launched at the 25th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show on 10 August 2017, and 88 units were sold exclusively for a limited time only.\n\nProduction of the third generation ceased in 2018, after 20 years of production, as Suzuki retooled in preparation of the fourth generation's launch in late 2018.\n\nThe Mazda AZ-Offroad, introduced in October 1998, is a rebadged Jimny. The \"AZ\" in the name refers to Autozam, Mazda's ill-fated small car marque. It is fitted with the turbocharged 660-cc DOHC Suzuki K6A engine, which produces . Manually operated four-wheel drive is standard with autolocking front hubs and low range, whilst an automatic transmission is optional.\n\nImages of the fourth generation Jimny were leaked on the internet in August 2017. Production commenced in Japan on 29 May 2018 at Suzuki's Kosai plant. The official images of this Jimny were revealed on 19 June 2018. The fourth generation Jimny and Jimny Sierra was launched in Japan on 5 July 2018. It has a retro style with a boxy design, not only reminiscent of the earlier LJ and SJ Jimny generations, but one that has also been called a small cross-breed between the Mercedes G-Wagen and the Land Rover Defender.\n\nThe basic version is powered by an R06A 660 cc, three-cylinder, turbocharged petrol engine, while the wide version (Jimny Sierra) has a newly developed K15B 1.5 L four-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine (75 kW (100.5 hp) at 6,000 rpm, 138 Nm (101.8 lb ft) at 4,400 rpm). The Jimny also features a clamshell bonnet, X-Lumbar integrated in the underbody, and tail lamps are positioned low on the rear bumper. The vehicle is available in eight color options and three dual-tone options.\n\nThe Jimny is one of the Suzuki vehicles, in addition to the Swift, to have adopted Suzuki Safety Support for preventive safety technologies.\n\nThe fourth generation Jimny was displayed in Indonesia at the 26th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in August 2018 and at the 27th Indonesia International Motor Show through April to May 2019, and launched at the 27th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show on 18 July 2019. It was also unveiled at PIMS 2018 for the Philippine market, and then the Jimny was launched at The 40th Bangkok International Motor Show 2019 on 26 March 2019 for the Thai market.\n\nThese four collapsed tables cover the development history of the Jimny in the Japanese domestic market, with notable export variations and developments also noted.\n\n\n"}

Some advanced maneuvers include: Hang ten toes, Hang five toes, Stretch-five, Front Foot/heel hang, Back Foot/heel hang. Noseriding is a functional maneuver best performed on waves around head high or less in size, which are found most of the year. Noseriding is performed mainly on noserider style surfboards, which are generally or more in length, with larger surface area and higher water displacement to provide a more stable walking surface.\n\n\"Noseriding wasn't identified as a maneuver unto itself until the early 1950s, after the surfboard fin had grown big enough to really anchor the tail.\" wrote Matt Warshaw in . According to most surfing historians, the fin was invented by Tom Blake around 1935, for the purpose of anchoring the tail and giving the surfboard direction from the tail to the tip. The fin enabled skilled surfers to walk to the front of the board without the tail skipping out from the wave. In 1947, Joe Quigg recorded, in drawings and words, the noseriding skill of Rabbit Kakai on waves at \"Outer Queens\" near Waikiki, Hawaii. One of the first commercial surfboard manufacturers, Dale Vezy is credited as being the first to get to the nose to hang five and hang ten in the early 1950s. Noseriding is widely considered the origin of \"Extreme\" surfing and had become such a popular trick by the late 1950s that Surfer Magazine publisher John Severson devoted a regular feature, called \"Toes on the Nose\", starting with his debut issue of Surfer in 1960.\n\nNoseriding defined the surfers of the 1950s led by Rabbit Kakai, then Matt Kivlin and Joe Quigg. Then came the champion surfers of the 60s including Lance Carson , Phil Edwards , Dewey Weber , Mickey Muñoz , Joey Cabell , Donald Takayama, Skip Frye , David Nuuhiwa , Gary Proper , Claude Codgen and Bob Purvey . Today's generation includes Joel Tudor , CJ Nelson and Chad Marshall. Current Toe-pointing women Association of Surfing Professional's World Tour champions include Kelia Moniz from Hawaii, Belinda Baggs from Australia, Chloe Calmon from Brazil and Kassia Meador from the USA.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, surfboard designers experimented with a variety of components to make the nose hold up longer and noserider surfboard designs became the hot sellers throughout the 60s. The combinations of template (outline shape), thickness, weight, rocker, rail shape, concaves, convexs, flats and fins vary with the individual surfer's style and size, and continue to be an experiment. To this day, noserider designs continue to be refined.\n\nSo far the knowledge bank has established certain principles: Concave under the nose creates an air pocket that helps the nose stay up longer; complementing the concave nose is a kicked up tail that would catch water to keep the tail down. While an accomplished surfer can nose ride a narrow shortboard nose, a wide nose (about wide) is considered a better platform for stability and lift. Rail shape can significantly affect the maneuverability from the nose. Rail shapes vary from turned up rails, which are found in most of today's noseriders, to turned down rails. Turned-up rails allow the board to turn easier from the tip, while the turned-down rail forces the board to stay in a trim and limits the turning ability from the tip. Of course, placement of the turned up or turned down rail is important. Turned up rails work best around the nose, while turned down rails work best around the tail. How much turn-down or turn up is measured in percnetages, i.e., 70/30 means 70% down and 30% up. Lighter board weights enable the board to stay higher on the water, so it can travel faster and allow the board to respond quicker and a lighter board allows for a thinner board. Single fins are preferred, albeit, fin configurations have a wide open frontier, as are weights and thickness.\n\nNoseriding is achieved mostly when the surfer positions them-self and the board where the wave is formed into the most vertical wall, just before the wave breaks. Point Break waves are ideal for noseriding because the wave travels from the point to the cove and gives the surfer a long ride where a \"hook\" is formed with the most vertical wall that travels down the line, like a zipper, from one end to the other. Immediately after the hook is the white water, where the wave implodes. It is best to avoid the white water but with a noserider surfboard, an accomplished surfer can ride through or maneuver around the imploding wave while remaining on the nose. One of the most difficult noseriding maneuvers is to get tubed while on the tip. It is not impossible to stay on the nose while out on the flat shoulder of the wave either. A noserider surfboard with a deep concave can carry a surfer on a wave that does not have a steep wall. Be prepared to back off the nose in this flat area of the wave because it has the least air traveling under the nose, so riding onto the flat of the wave while on the nose could cause the nose to suddenly dip into the water under the full weight of the surfer.\n\nIn 1965, Tom Morey (inventor of the \"Morey-Boogie\": body board) devised the first professional surf contest around timing nose rides. The \"nose\" area was defined as the front 25% of the board. While success at this subgenre is grossly measured in proximity to the tip of the board and time spent there, the acknowledged stylists move forward and backward fluidly on the board by cross-stepping or \"walking\" foot-over-foot and/or shuffling with poise and economy of movement, resolving changes in upward pressure with subtle adjustments to their center of gravity using knees, waist and hips (upper bodies ever quiet) and position on the board; never the arms waving.\n"}

This includes locales in the Modoc Plateau, southern Cascade Range, Klamath Mountains, and northern Sierra Nevada. It is slow-growing in the wild, and is mostly restricted to sites difficult for plant growth, on serpentine soils and on old lava flows.

They are part of the water vascular system.\n\nTube feet function in locomotion, feeding, and respiration. The tube feet in a starfish are arranged in grooves along the arms. They operate through hydraulic pressure. They are used to pass food to the oral mouth at the center, and can attach to surfaces. A starfish that is overturned simply turns one arm over and attaches it to a solid surface, and levers itself the right way up. Tube feet allow these different types of animals to stick to the ocean floor and move slowly. \n\nEach tube foot consists of two parts: the ampulla and the podium. The ampulla is a water-filled sac contained in the body of the animal that contains both circular muscles and longitudinal muscle. The podia is the tube-shaped structure that protrudes out from the body and contains longitudinal muscle only. When the muscles around the ampulla contract, they squeeze water from the ampulla into the connected podium, causing the podium to elongate. When the muscles around the podium contract, they squeeze the water back into the ampulla, causing the podium to contract. The podia use a chemical adhesive (no suction) to attach to the substratum.\n"}
{"id": "2232472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232472", "title": "Freeriding", "text": "Freeriding\n\nFreeriding is a style of snowboarding or skiing performed on natural, un-groomed terrain, without a set course, goals or rules. It evolved throughout the sport's formative early years as a contrary response to the highly regimented style of ski competition prevalent at the time. Snowboarders primarily refer to freeriding as backcountry, sidecountry, or off-piste snowboarding, and sometimes big mountain or extreme riding.\n\nFreeriding incorporates various aspects of snowboarding into a style that adapts to the variations and challenges of natural, off-piste terrain, and eschews man-made features such as jumps, rails, half-pipes, or groomed snow. To master freeriding is to seamlessly merge these aspects of other snowboarding disciplines such as freestyle and alpine snowboarding into an all-around style - giving you the freedom to make the most of whatever terrain comes your way. Whereas freestyle snowboarding relies on the use of man-made terrain such as jumps, rails and half-pipes, and alpine snowboarding is done on groomed snow, freeriding utilizes the random flow of natural terrain to perform similar tricks.\n\nDue to their use of backcountry routes, freeriders are (proportionally) much more likely to become a victim of avalanches. One estimate considers that about 80% of all avalanche deaths in the Alps occur among freeride/backcountry riders.\n\nWhile the term “freeriding” originated in snowboarding, some skiers have adopted it in recent years. For many years, the skiing equivalent of freeriding was known as freeskiing and referred specifically to off-piste skiing. However over the years, especially since the arrival of snowboarding, the term \"freeskiing\" has come to refer to freestyle skiing. This has left traditional “freeskiers” without a name for their style of skiing, and so some now use the snowboarding term instead. This became somewhat official in 2013, when the “Freeride World Tour” absorbed the “Freeskiing World Tour” into its schedule of competitive events.\n\nFreeride snowboards make up a large part of the market as they are the ideal choice for the all-rounder.\n\nA freeride board usually has a directional shape and flex pattern with a nose that is softer than the tail - this helps with turn initiation and with handling cruddy/choppy snow conditions. Overall a freeride board is stiffer tip to tail and edge to edge for a more precise and stable ride. Boots and bindings are usually stiffer than their freestyle snowboarding counterparts as well.\n\nSome freeride boards are designed more specifically for powder than for groomers. Many powder boards are tapered, which means they have a narrower tail than nose. Some have rocker, which means instead of camber these boards have their lowest point between your bindings and they bend up towards the tips. Some powder boards have a swallow tail design which allows the tail to sink easier which in turn keeps the nose up and some have pintails which make the board faster edge to edge in deep snow.\n\nCraig Kelly (April 1, 1966 - January 20, 2003) is known as the 'Godfather of Freeriding'; Terje Haakonsen called Kelly the best snowboarder of all time. He shocked the snowboard industry by walking away from multimillion-dollar deals to pursue freeriding.\n\nThe distinctive fluid manner in which he rode was recognized and acclaimed in the snowboarding community. He was called a \"style master\" by snowboard magazine editor Jon Foster. Kelly appeared in many video and photo shoots. He was known for looking straight at the camera, even in the midst of a difficult aerial maneuver.\n\nKelly was a Sims Snowboards team rider for a few years early in his career, but spent most of his life riding for Burton Snowboards. He was responsible for the design and development of many snowboards for the Burton Snowboards brand. The company's founder, Jake Burton, is quoted as saying, “When I started listening to Craig, that was when my company became successful and really took off.” He added, “… when the rest of the industry listened to Craig, that was when the sport really took off.”\n\nCraig Kelly died on January 20, 2003 near Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada in an avalanche which trapped 8 people and killed 6 others. Jacques Russo's film documentary, \"Let It Ride\", celebrates Craig Kelly's life.\n\nJohan Olofsson (born October 27, 1976) is a snowboarder known for being one of the first riders to take freestyle tricks more commonly performed in man-made terrain parks into the big mountain freeriding environments of Alaska. Originally coming from a freestyle background, Olofsson adapted his spin tricks and jibs to the backcountry environment. He gained attention and respect from the freeriding community when he started performing these tricks off natural features such as windlips and cliffs in the midst of steep lines in the Alaskan ranges.\n\nJeremy Jones (born 14 January 1975) is a former snowboard racer now regarded as a pioneer of professional big mountain riding. His style is a seminal influence on modern big mountain freeriding.\n\nTravis Rice (born October 9, 1982) is regarded as the “Paul Revere” of the big mountain freestyle movement. Best known for his success in the realm of freestyle snowboarding competition, his ability to adapt his skills to extreme terrain has gained him legendary status in backcountry circles as well.\n\nFreeride competitions basically involve negotiating steep natural terrain fluidly in a similar approach to slopestyle competitors in a terrain park. However unlike the freestyle discipline of slopestyle, there are no perfect man-made takeoffs or landings - each individual rider's route varies, and is personally plotted out in pre-run inspections. Constantly changing weather and snow conditions add an extra element to these events, and the unpredictably random aspect of freeride terrain contributes to a high risk of personal injury.\n\nThe Freeride World Tour is an annually toured series of events in which the world's best freeriders compete for individual event wins, as well as the overall title of World Champion in their respective genders and disciplines. The first event series under the Freeride World Tour moniker took place in 2008. Prior to that it was known as the Verbier Extreme, originally a snowboard only contest launched in 1996 - with skiers also invited to compete in 2004. For the 2013 season, the Freeride World Tour merged with the Freeskiing World Tour and The North Face Masters of Snowboarding, combining all three tours under one unified global championship series.\n\nFrom 1995-2001 New Zealand's World Heli Challenge invited international extreme snowboarders and skiers to compete in New Zealand's Mt. Cook National Park. The helicopter-accessed competition occurred over a two-week period to allow for weather and snow conditions. In 2001, the tragedy of the 9/11 terrorist attacks interrupted international sponsorship support leading to an eight-year break. Footage from the previous years events continued to play worldwide. In 2009 the World Heli Challenge resumed and has been running annually ever since.\n"}

Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids. This medication is approved for treatment of psoriasis, acne, and sun damaged skin (photodamage). It is commonly sold in two concentrations: 0.05% and 0.1%.\n\nTazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the cognate carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by rapid deesterification in animals and humans. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RARα, RARβ, and RARγ but shows relative selectivity for RARβ, and RARγ and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.\n\nCommon side effects include worsening of acne, increased sensitivity to sunlight, dry skin, itchiness, redness and in some cases extreme drying and cracking of skin. For most patients these side effects are uncomfortable but mild and decrease markedly after the first 2–4 weeks of use except for increased sensitivity to sunlight. \n\nFor best results dermatologists recommend applying the cream or gel once daily before bedtime after washing the face with a mild cleanser. Dermatologists recommend using a moisturizer so that skin will not be as dry and flaky.\n\nTazarotene is most commonly used topically to treat acne, psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body), and to reduce skin wrinkling and liver spots.\n\nTazarotene is rated pregnancy category X, and should not be used by pregnant women.\n\n\"There is limited evidence that tazarotene and isotretinoin benefit patients with moderate photodamage on the face: both are associated with skin irritation and erythema.\" \n\nIn addition to tretinoin, which has been associated with greater skin improvements with high concentrations, tazarotene and isotretinoin creams are also found to be effective for photodamage, but at the expense of skin irritation. More evidence is needed before any recommendations can be made on oral or topical polysaccharides or hydroxy acids. Evidence from one trial suggests that the effectiveness of 0.05% tretinoin, is equivalent to the effects of 0.05% and 0.1% tazarotene. However, for acne vulgaris, several recent double blind studies have shown consistently superior efficacy for tazarotene and roughly equal tolerability for both treatments.\n\n\"Specifically, tazarotene reduced the number of noninflammatory and inflammatory lesions at 4, 8, and 12 weeks -- all timepoints examined during treatment. Although the reduction of inflammatory lesions compared with tretinoin did not achieve statistical significance, the reduction of open comedones at 12 weeks was 65% for tazarotene vs 44% for tretinoin (P = .034). Tazarotene also proved superior in the reduction of noninflammatory lesions at 12 weeks (55% vs 42% for tretinoin, P = .042).\" \n\nAcetylenic retinoid prodrug converted to the active metabolite, tazarotenic acid, with selective affinity for retinoic acid receptors RARβ and RARγ. \n\nThe formation of the ring system involves first alkylation of the anion from thiophenol with dimethylallyl bromide (1) to give the thioether (2). Friedel-Crafts cyclization of the olefin with the equivalent of PPA then gives the thiopyran (3). Acylation with acetyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride gives the methyl ketone (4). Reaction of the enolate of that ketone with diethyl chlorophosphate gives the enol phosphate 5 as a transient intermediate. This eliminates diethyl phosphite in the presence of excess base to give the corresponding acetylene 6. The anion from the reaction of the acetylene with base is then used to displace chlorine from Ethyl 6-chloronicotinate (7). This reaction affords the coupling product tazarotene (8).\n"}

He is noted for the characters he created with paradoxical and grotesque characteristics: Professor Kranz, the ultra-timid Giandomenico Fracchia, and the obsequious and meek accountant Ugo Fantozzi, perhaps the favourite character in Italian comedy. He wrote several books, usually of satirical character. He also acted in dramatic roles, and appeared in several movies.\n\nPaolo Villaggio was born in Genova, to Ettore Villaggio (1905–1992), a surveyor originally from Palermo, and Maria, originally from Venice, a German-language teacher. Paolo had a twin brother, Piero, who taught at the University of Pisa.\n\nFrom there, Villaggio was hired for the TV programme \"Quelli della domenica\" (The Sunday guys), in which Fantozzi made his first appearance, introduced his characters, the aggressive \"Professor Kranz\" and the hypocritical \"Giandomenico Fracchia\".\n\nHe has received several cinema awards, including the David di Donatello (1990), the Nastro d'Argento (1992) and the Golden Lion for his entire career (1992).\n\nAfter his television experience, Villaggio started writing, for the magazines \"L'Espresso\" and \"L'Europeo\", short stories featuring accountant Ugo Fantozzi, a man with a weak character, dogged by misfortune and by the \"mega-director\" of the \"mega-company\" where he works. In 1971, the publishing house Rizzoli released the book \"Fantozzi\", a collection of these stories, which sold over a million copies.\nThe first book received the Gogol Prize in Moscow and led to his 1975 appearance in the film \"Fantozzi\", directed by Luciano Salce. The film's success led to a sequel, \"Il secondo tragico Fantozzi\", with the same director in the following year, in which Fantozzi delivered his most famous line: \"Per me ... \"La Corazzata Kotiomkin\" [sic] ... è una cagata pazzesca\", or roughly \"For me \"The Battleship Kotemkin\" [sic] is an unbelievable load of crap\".\n\nVillaggio has played in numerous comedies. He has been directed by Federico Fellini (\"La voce della luna\", 1990, with Roberto Benigni), Lina Wertmüller (\"Io speriamo che me la cavo\", 1992), by Ermanno Olmi (\"The Secret of the Old Woods\", 1993), by Mario Monicelli (\"Cari fottutissimi amici\", 1994), and by Gabriele Salvatores (\"Denti\", 2000).\n\nVillaggio continued writing while acting in films. He moved to the Mondadori publishing house in 1994. He published \"Fantozzi saluta e se ne va\" (1994–1995; \"Fantozzi Says Goodbye and Leaves\"), \"Vita morte e miracoli di un pezzo di merda\" (\"Life, Death and Miracles of a Piece of Shit\", 2002), \"7 grammi in 70 anni\" (\"7 Grammes in 70 Years\", 2003) and his latest, \"Sono incazzato come una belva\" (\"I'm Fucking Mad as a Beast\") in 2004.\n\nHe also acted in stage plays, playing Arpagone in \"L'Avare\" of Molière in 1996. In 1996 he also led the satirical news bulletin \"Striscia la notizia\" (broadcast on Canale 5), together with Massimo Boldi. More recently, he participated in the television fiction \"Carabinieri\", in which he played the role of a tramp who often helped the police to solve crimes. Villaggio was also a lyricist. With fellow Genoan Fabrizio De André, he wrote two songs, \"Carlo Martello torna dalla battaglia di Poitiers\" (\"Charles Martel returning from the Battle of Poitiers\") and \"Il fannullone\" (\"The Loafer\").\n\nVillaggio died on 3 July 2017 from complications of diabetes in Rome at the age of 84.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is a three-time World Champion on the vault (2005–2007) and 2006 World Champion on floor exercise. She was a member of the gold medal-winning Chinese teams for the 2006 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus, Denmark and 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. She was also a member of the silver medal-winning Chinese team for the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nCheng Fei was born in central China's Hubei Province to a father who was a shipping clerk and a mother who worked in a tire factory, not a very wealthy background. Indeed, said her mother, \"Our family was poor so we hoped Cheng Fei could in some way change her life...we thought maybe being a professional athlete is good for her.\" And so her parents approached a gymnastics coach about training her by the time she was three and her father practiced calisthenics with her every morning before school. By the age of five, Cheng won her first competitive medal at a local competition. The 7-year-old Cheng was sent to Wuhan, where she joined the Wuhan Institute of Physical Education and officially entered the national sports program. Her first coach, Yao Juying remembered her as being uniquely 'hard-working' and extraordinarily focused. At ten, she was invited to join the Hubei provincial team. In late 2001, at the age of 13, she was accepted to the Chinese National Team. Her coaches are head coach Lu Shanzhen, and Liu Qun Lin.\n\nCheng Fei is well known in the sporting world for being highly consistent, powerful and elegant, as well as displaying a fine level of sportsmanship. Sandra Izbașa, 2008 Olympic Floor Champion has described her as a perfectionist, a great sport and a good friend. Shawn Johnson, 2008 Olympic Beam Champion, was also quoted to have called Cheng Fei 'inspirational' and 'a great competitor'. Cheng Fei's leadership abilities are of paramount importance to the Chinese Women's Gymnastics Team.\n\nShe retired in June 2012 due to a ruptured Achilles tendon while performing a tumbling pass on the floor.\n\nCheng Fei is a vaulting and floor exercise specialist. She has had national success in gymnastics as a two-time Chinese National Floor Exercise Champion (2004–2005), a two-time Chinese National Vault medalist (2003 and 2005) and the 2004 Chinese National Balance Beam Champion.\n\nInternationally, she has been very successful as well. She competed with the Chinese team at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece and although the team did not medal, she performed very well, scoring 9.475 on vault and 9.662 on floor. She also qualified for and competed in the floor exercise final, finishing 4th with a score of 9.412. She was the bronze medalist at the 2004 World Cup Final on floor exercise.\n\nOn 23 November 2005 Cheng made history at the 2005 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Melbourne, Australia, for being the first gymnast ever to successfully perform one of the most difficult vaults ever attempted by a woman. The vault consisting of: a round-off onto the springboard, a half-turn onto the vaulting horse and a 1½ somersault with a 540-degree turn in a straight body position, is now officially recognized in the FIG Code of Points as \"The Cheng\" which carries a D-score of 6.5 under the 2009 Code of Points. During Event Finals on vault in Melbourne, Cheng scored 9.725 in her first vault (S.V: 10.0) and 9.587 in her second vault (S.V: 10.0), the \"Cheng\".\n\nAt the 2006 World Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, she competed on vault and floor exercise, qualifying in first position for both event finals. Her performances on those two pieces of apparatus were instrumental in securing victory for China in the team championship, but they also earned her the individual vault and floor exercise world titles. Cheng also won the gold medal on the vault at the 2006 World Cup Final in São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nIn 2007 Cheng began the year by winning the vault, balance beam and floor exercise titles at a World Cup event in Maribor, Slovenia. She was undefeated on vaulting and floor exercise in 2007 until the 2007 World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany. At those championships, Cheng was recognized as the leader for the Chinese women's team and though Cheng won her third World title on the vault, she made a serious error on the vault during the team championship where the Chinese team finished 2nd. She went on to finish 5th on floor exercise, with a score of 15.050, after stepping out of the bounds with both feet in her final tumbling series.\n\nCheng fulfilled her goal of competing at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China as the captain to the Chinese team. In the qualification, Cheng competed on three events, placing first on both vault and floor exercise, and fifth on balance beam. She was one of three female gymnasts to have entered 3 Olympic Event Finals in those Games, along with Nastia Liukin and Anna Pavlova. In the team final, She led the team to win China's first-ever women's gymnastics Olympic team gold medal in history. Individually, she won a bronze medal on vault (even after falling on her own \"Cheng Fei vault\"). She got 16.075 and 15.025 on her saltos. She won another bronze medal on balance beam (15.950) and placing 7th in the floor exercise event final (14.550), after an uncharacteristic fall. Cheng cried after the unfortunate vault and floor finals. After the Olympics, she said that she cried about her failure to capture the two gold medals she wanted most until she could cry no more. However, she received great support from both her fellow countrymen and the international gymnastics community, who acknowledged her talents and abilities as an exceptional gymnast. In a show of respect she gave the winner of the balance beam final Shawn Johnson of United States a small box with silk inside it.\nAfter the Olympic Games, she competed in various competitions. She won three gold medals on vault, floor exercise and balance beam at the DTG World Cup in Stuttgart. Her last 2008 competition was the 14th Artistic Gymnastics World Cup in Madrid where she won two gold medals on vault and floor exercise.\n\nIn 2009, she competed at the 25th Universiade in Belgrade and won a team Gold medal and a Silver medal on Vault.\n\nAfter a near two-year off from competitions due to a leg injury, she competed in the 2011 Chinese National Championships in May on vault and floor Exercise. She led the qualifications on vault and finished 2nd in the final. She announced her intention to compete in the University Games in August, but was reported to be suffering from leg injury again and retreated from the competition.\n\nIn April 2012, Cheng competed at the Zibo World Cup in her home country, qualifying second into the vault final behind the Dominican Republic's Yamilet Peña Abreu. She intended to compete floor as well, but withdrew prior to the qualifying round. Cheng won the gold medal in the vault final.\n\nCheng injured her Achilles tendon in June 2012, taking her out of the running for the 2012 Chinese Olympic Team. In June 2012, she announced her retirement from elite artistic gymnastics, trying to switch from being an elite gymnast to a gymnastics coach.\n\nVault: Yurchenko ½ on into 1½ twists off (6.0)\n\nAs of 2008, Cheng Fei performed the following skills on these apparatuses:\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike the other stations on the NSL (apart from Canberra), the station has side platforms due to engineering constraints. Located underneath the traffic junction of Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and Lorong 2 Toa Payoh, Braddell station primarily serves the estates in the northern part of Toa Payoh New Town.\n\nOpened on 7 November 1987, Braddell station is one of the five stations that collectively make up Singapore's oldest MRT stations.\n\nWhen the MRT system was under planning since 1981, MRTC tried to design the track system and position in order to enable the station to have a common platform, like in the mainstream MRT stations. However, the closely built HDB Blocks in Toa Payoh estate meant that the MRT system tunnels had to be constructed directly under Lorong 2 Toa Payoh, following the bend of the road, in the area between Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and Toa Payoh MRT Station. The result made it impossible for tracks to diverge at a common platform station, as the angle Southbound trains would turn when approaching and leaving the station would be too great. Additionally, it would be unfeasible to change the position of the station, because moving it south would render it too close to Toa Payoh MRT station, while moving it north would be impossible because of surrounding HDB blocks and JTC Flatted factories. It was thus built with side platforms unlike other NSL stations. Construction of this station was awarded to Singapore Belgium Contractors Limited under Contract 103A on 7 April 1984. To facilitate the construction, two of the six lanes at Toa Payoh Lorong 1 and 2, were temporarily closed from February 1985 to February 1986. Braddell was among the first of five stations opened for operation on 7 November 1987.\n\nOn 7 May 2008, a robber tried to rob from the 7-Eleven convenience store within the station at 3.10 pm, but was instead locked in the shop by the cashier who dashed out of the shop. The robber could not escape and the Police arrived shortly but the robber threatened to commit suicide. The robber was finally apprehended by the police's taser gun and arrested.\n\nOn 7 October 2017, water got into a section of the tunnel from Bishan to Braddell MRT stations during the heavy downpour in the afternoon, which has disrupted train services along 13 stations on the North-South Line for several hours. This case of water entering MRT tunnels is believed to be the first time it has affected train service along the NSL. Separately, at about 5.55pm, a small fire was spotted trackside in the tunnel between Marina Bay and Raffles Place MRT station, but it has died down by itself. It is not clear if it is linked to the flood, although electrical short circuits caused by water had sparked tunnel fires before. Train services between Marina South Pier and Newton were restored on the day itself at about 9.20pm. Train services between Newton and Ang Mo Kio were fully resumed at around 2pm the following day after overnight efforts to clear the water in the tunnel, after 20 hours of service disruption, being the worst in SMRT's history. It was revealed that the overflowing in the tunnel was caused by a malfunction in the water pumping system, which has since been repaired.\n"}

It consists of the south side of the Burrard Inlet, extending from Point Grey in the southwest to Prospect Point in the northeast.\n\nEnglish Bay Beach, near the city's West End residential neighbourhood, is the most popular sunbathing, swimming, and sunset-watching beach in the downtown Vancouver area. Other downtown beaches facing English Bay include Sunset Beach, Second Beach, and Third Beach. Along the south shore of the bay lie Kitsilano Beach, Jericho Beach, the Spanish Banks beaches, and Locarno Beach, while on the North Shore are Ambleside Beach and various smaller cove-beaches in the city of West Vancouver. English Bay beaches are all major tourist attraction to visitors all year long, with the peak season being late summer.\n\nThe Vancouver Seawall runs all the way around English Bay from Stanley Park in the northeast around False Creek at Point Grey facing the Strait of Georgia in the southwest. This is a favourite destination for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and roller-bladers. (Note: the Seawall is one-way for cyclists and roller-bladers, running counter-clockwise from just east of Lions Gate Bridge to Third Beach.)\n\nEnglish Bay Beach is host to a number of public events. The Celebration of Light is a fireworks competition that is held for two weeks every summer (usually the last week in July and first week in August). While this competition often struggles to secure funding, it has successfully run since 1990 and is the largest off-shore fireworks display in the world. Each winter it is the host of Vancouvers' annual Polar Bear Swim and each summer the Vancouver Pride Parade and Festival is held on English Bay Beach.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, English Bay Beach was home to Vancouver's first official lifeguard, the legendary Joe Fortes, who taught hundreds of the city's early residents how to swim, and patrolled the beach from his cabin on its shore. Today, the waters of the bay are often dotted with hundreds of small pleasure boats, as well as huge freighters waiting at anchor to load cargoes at Vancouver's port.\n\nThe beach was the site of an oil spill in Vancouver on April 8, 2015. The official cause of the spill has not been confirmed, but at least 2700 litres of \"bunker fuel\" are known to have escaped from a cargo ship into the bay. The highly toxic oil later washed up on nearby beaches, creating a slick 15–20 cm thick. At least twenty seabirds were injured or affected by the spill, but the full extent of any environmental and economic damage is unknown at this early stage. The federal government was criticized for its response to the spill, including the delay in notifying the public of the health hazard, by the mayor and premier, environmental scientists, and an international shipping expert. Coast Guard officials defended the response, with regional director Assistant Commissioner Roger Girouard saying, \"it was exceptional\".\n\nThe beaches were tested and most were reopened following a ten-day closure. While the water and soil at most of the beaches tested was found not to have harmful levels of oil present, the government cautioned that \"small amounts\" of oil may remain, and urged people to be aware of the possible hazard and avoid contact with any oil. The reopened beaches will continue to be tested and the need for further cleanup assessed as needed.\n\n"}

Due to poor sales, Kiss did not embark on a supporting tour for the first time in its eight-year history, opting instead to make a handful of promotional appearances. \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" was the first album with drummer Eric Carr and the last album to feature Ace Frehley until their 1996 reunion Alive/Worldwide Tour apart from appearing on the cover of the compilation album \"Killers\" and the next album \"Creatures of the Night\" and a handful of promotional appearances with the band until late 1982.\n\nWhile \"A World Without Heroes\" was later performed on the band's 1995 \"MTV Unplugged\" appearance, Kiss have largely avoided live performances of songs from the album following initial promotional appearances in 1981. Critical reception for the album was relatively kind on release, but the album proved to be a commercial failure and was for a long time largely unpopular with the involved parties, label and musicians alike, as well as critics, even sometimes being called one of the worst albums ever. Nevertheless, it has garnered some positive reappraisal in recent years, with some critics admitting the record had its issues, but that it was still a concept album worthy of note.\n\nKiss was in the midst of a transitional phase as the 1980s began. Peter Criss was not involved in the recording of 1980's \"Unmasked:\" he officially left Kiss in May of the same year. His replacement (Eric Carr) was officially introduced in July. The group had recently embarked on a hugely successful tour of Australia and New Zealand (where the group's popularity was at its peak) in November, but the band's commercial fortunes at home were drastically reduced from the 1975–79 era. Due to the lackluster sales of \"Unmasked\", Kiss toured exclusively outside the U.S. for the first time in their career (except for one concert at the Palladium Theatre in New York). The overseas tours were well attended, partly because Kiss had rarely ventured abroad and because the more pop-oriented \"Dynasty\" and \"Unmasked\" albums did better in the European markets than their earlier hard rock albums.\n\nThis commercial downturn is attributable to many factors; two of the biggest being the softening of Kiss' image in an effort to appeal to a broader fanbase and the softening of their music. \"Unmasked\" was a decidedly more pop-oriented effort than earlier albums, and represented a sales drop-off of 65% from 1979's \"Dynasty\". It also became the first Kiss album to fail to achieve platinum status since 1975's \"Dressed to Kill\". The glut of Kiss merchandising that had cropped up in the late 1970s led to a backlash from many fans who felt that Kiss was then more concerned with making money than with making good music.\n\nIn an effort to return to their hard rock roots, Kiss began recording music more akin to the hard rock style that launched them to popularity in the mid-1970s. The fall 1980 issue of the \"Kiss Army Newsletter\" hinted at the style the new album was to take: \"It will be hard and heavy from start to finish, straight-on rock and roll that will knock your socks off.\" But at the same time, Simmons, Stanley, and creative manager Bill Aucoin felt that just returning to a harder sound was not enough. They believed that only a bold, artistic statement would regenerate public interest in Kiss. To that end, they enlisted producer Bob Ezrin to work with the group, who, in turn, employed members from the American Symphony Orchestra and St. Robert's Choir to record tracks for the album. Ezrin had worked with the group before, producing the group's hit 1976 album \"Destroyer\". He had also co-produced Pink Floyd's 1979 concept album \"The Wall\". Simmons, Stanley, and Aucoin felt that Ezrin could help bring their ambitions to fruition.\n\nThe original vinyl release was a gatefold sleeve. This was the first Kiss album to feature no image of the group, not even the customary front-cover appearance. According to one story, the hand reaching for the door knocker is not that of Stanley: Aucoin has stated that it belongs to a handmodel, hired for the shoot; however, in 2011 a photo surfaced from the album cover shoot showing a partially naked-faced Stanley with his hand on the door knocker. The door itself was long rumored to be located at the Park Ave United Methodist church on Park Avenue, New York City, but was actually a prop created for the shoot. The photo session displayed a change of image: the costumes were more streamlined, especially when compared with the costumes for \"Unmasked\", as were the hairstyles of Stanley and Simmons in particular.\n\nRecording sessions for the album commenced in March 1981. Sessions were held in Toronto, New York City, and Frehley's home recording studio in Wilton, Connecticut. During the recording, Ezrin and Kiss worked in complete secrecy. Ezrin, in particular, had insisted that he would only communicate with Kiss or Aucoin. No one other than Ezrin and Kiss ever heard the album in progress. Frehley became increasingly frustrated during the sessions, as he disagreed with the band's decision to abandon their original plan to record a straight rock album. Additionally, a number of guitar solos Frehley recorded were not included in the final cut. Frehley was often outvoted 2–1 on band decisions after Criss' departure. Carr was not a partner in Kiss as the other three members were, but rather an employee. Frehley resented what he felt was Simmons' and Stanley's domination of the recording sessions.\n\nWhen Kiss premiered \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" for their management and record company in October 1981, the reaction was a mixture of confusion and resentment. Business manager Howard Marks refused to allow his company's name to appear in the liner notes. Fan reaction to the album was equally harsh, while critical reaction was comparably positive. But while reviews like the one printed by \"Rolling Stone\" were much kinder than past reviews, the album quickly disappeared from the charts by February, 1982. \"Q\" magazine ranked \"Music From \"The Elder\"\" 44th in their list of The 50 Worst Albums Ever. The same magazine ranked the album 6th in their list of 15 Albums Where Great Rock Acts Lost the Plot.\n\nAlthough budgets were prepared for a tour, none was ever undertaken. The only public appearances the band made in conjunction with the album were a January 15, 1982 appearance on the late-night variety show \"Fridays\" (they performed \"A World Without Heroes\", \"I\" and \"The Oath\"), \"Solid Gold\" (\"A World Without Heroes\" and \"I\"), and a January 28 lip synched performance of \"I\" from Studio 54, broadcast via satellite to the Sanremo Festival in Italy. Frehley was absent for the Studio 54 appearance, so the group performed as a trio.\n\nMost participants in the album's recording admit that it was a major misstep for Kiss. Ezrin, despite his recent success with the even more ambitious \"Wall\" album, admitted that his judgments concerning \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" were clouded due in large part to a cocaine addiction at the time. Stanley and Simmons admit that they were \"delusional\" concerning the project, while Frehley has stated that he felt that it was not a good idea to begin with.\nThere are rumors that The Elder has sold around 500,000 copies, however, this has yet to be substantiated by any official audit, and has not been certified gold as of 2018.\n\nDespite the general negative feelings towards this album, it has garnered some occasional praise in recent years. In 2011, Spanish authors Alberto Díaz and Xavi Martínez included it in their book \"Concept albums: 150 essential releases\". Also in 2011, the American website \"Guitar World\" mentioned the album among their \"50 Great Albums Celebrating Their 30th Anniversary in 2011\" while the Brazilian magazine \"Roadie Crew\" did likewise in a list of \"The 81 Greatest Albums of 1981\". \"Roadie Crew\" would later, in 2017, rank it among their greatest 40 concept albums ever, at #22. In 2016, \"Classic Rock\" ranked the album among a list of \"The 20 Most Underrated Classic Rock Albums Ever\", calling the album \"anomalous\" but stating that it \"nonetheless has much to recommend it\". In 2018, the French edition of the \"Rock Hard\" magazine included it in the Volume 2 of its \"ideal metaltheque\", in the concept albums category.\n\nThe basic plot of \"The Elder\" involves the recruitment and training of a young hero (The Boy) by the Council of Elders who belong to the Order of the Rose, a mysterious group dedicated to combating evil. The Boy is guided by an elderly caretaker named Morpheus. The album's lyrics describe the boy's feelings during his journey and training, as he overcomes his early doubts to become confident and self-assured. The only spoken dialogue is at the end of the last track, \"I\". During the passage, Morpheus proclaims to the Elders that The Boy is ready to undertake his odyssey.\n\nThe version of \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" released in the US, Europe and Brazil contained a different song order than the one originally intended. This order was chosen in order to emphasize \"The Oath\" and \"A World Without Heroes\" as potential singles (the two songs started each side of the record). One effect of this alteration in song order was to disrupt the narrative flow of the album's story.\n\nThe Japanese pressing of the album contained the intended song sequence, although \"Escape from the Island\" was excluded from the album and instead included as the B-side of \"The Oath\" single. This sequence was used (with the inclusion of \"Escape from the Island\") when \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" was re-released on CD in 1997. A number of narrative passages were cut from the final version of the album. These passages were meant to provide details of the story, and to act as transitional elements between songs.\n\nA heavy metal track that opened the original version of the album, many parts of the song also feature Stanley singing in falsetto, a vocal technique he utilized on several of the album's tracks. Stanley played lead and rhythm guitars, while Frehley played bass.\n\n\"Dark Light\", written by Frehley, was based on a guitar riff composed by Anton Fig. When it was originally recorded as a pre-\"Music from \"The Elder\"\" demo, the title was \"Don't Run\". It is the only song Frehley sings on the album.\n\nThe lone American single from the album was originally entitled \"Every Little Bit of Your Heart\". The name was changed when it was decided to record \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" as a concept album. Lou Reed wrote the lyric \"a world without heroes is like a world without sun.\" The video for the song was the first Kiss video played by MTV. \"A World Without Heroes\" and \"I\" are the only songs on the album where Frehley does not play. The song was covered by Cher on her album \"Love Hurts\" and heavy metal band Witherscape on the EP \"The New Tomorrow\".\n\nAn instrumental track performed by Ace Frehley, Eric Carr and Bob Ezrin. Frehley recounted the recording of this song in a 2016 interview with The Pods & Sods Network.\n\n\n\n\n\nSingles – Billboard (United States)\nSingles – \"Billboard\" (United Kingdom)\nSingles – Australia\nSingles – Germany\nSingles – Netherlands\n"}
{"id": "2232499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232499", "title": "Dolly Dots", "text": "Dolly Dots\n\nDolly Dots were a popular Dutch girl band in the 1980s. With their style of upbeat dance/pop, they scored many hits throughout Europe. The sextet consisted of Angela Groothuizen, Angéla Kramers, Anita Heilker, Esther Oosterbeek, Patty Zomer and Ria Brieffies.\n\nThe Dolly Dots had many hits between 1979 and 1988. They were most successful in the Netherlands, but they also scored hits in the rest of Europe. Their single \"Radio\" was a big hit in Japan. \"P.S.\" was a Top 50 \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play hit in 1981. They also enjoyed hits in Turkey, Lebanon, Iceland, and toured through Egypt. Although the band never cracked England, they did feature on the 23 June 1983 edition of \"Top of the Pops\" when they were interviewed by DJ John Peel whilst on location in Amsterdam.\n\nAt the peak of their success in 1984, the Dolly Dots had their own TV series, \"Barbie Dolls, Wallpaper\", and a #1 hit, \"Love Me Just a Little Bit More (Totally Hooked on You)\". At the end of the following year, Anita Heilker left the group to have a daughter. She later became the Dutch voice of Donald Duck. The rest of the band continued as a five-piece.\n\nHeilker had already launched her own career. In 1986, she released four solo singles (\"You've Got Me Keyed Up\", \"Into the Night\", \"Dancing on the Moon\" and \"Don't Treat Me Like This\"), as well as a solo album (\"The Girl in Black\").\n\nSince the TV series' success in 1984, there had been plans to record a Hollywood film. In the summer of 1986, the five remaining Dolly Dots finally went to the US to work with an unfinished script and made a movie called \"Dutch Treat\", which was released later that year. The movie (starring Lorin Dreyfuss and David Landsberg) and its soundtrack were modest successes in The Netherlands but were not released in the US due to poor reviews. The group broke up in 1988. Their last single was an attempt to break into the UK market. The Dolly Dots teamed up with hit producers Stock Aitken Waterman and released the song \"What a Night\". It reached number 18 in the Dutch charts, but was not successful in the UK.\n\nOn October 2, 1988, the Dolly Dots played a farewell show at the Amsterdam Escape. After more than 9 years, they felt the time was right to go their separate ways. Ria Brieffies was later quoted \"There's more to life than being a Dolly Dot\".\n\nIn 1989, Anita Heilker taped a sitcom with satirical duo Henk Spaan and Harry Vermeegen (\"Die 2\", \"\"Those 2\"\" in English) for early 1990 broadcast on Veronica.\n\nAngela Groothuizen teamed up with Ruud Mulder, former guitarist of disco/funk-contemporaries Spargo, to record as Angela & the Rude. \nShe also began a television hosting career for AVRO starting in 1990 with an adaptation of \"Challenge Anneka\"; this was followed by \"Sex with Angela\" and later, \"Who's the Mole?\". Her contract expired in 2005 and was not renewed. Groothuizen has since moved to RTL 4 where she was a panel judge for \"X Factor\", \"The Voice of Holland\" and \"The Voice Kids\". She is also host of the show \"Een Nieuw Begin\". Groothuizen is still making music and has her own theatre shows.\n\nPatty Zomer became a fashion stylist for several well-known Dutch artists and magazines. In the early 2000s, she co-hosted \"The Fashion Police\" with former actress Nada van Nie.\n\nOn October 1, 1998, all six Dolly Dots were interviewed by Paul de Leeuw and surprised everyone by singing a medley of three of their biggest hits. Two months later they reunited for a one-off concert to celebrate the 10th anniversary of their split, and the release of a compilation album of all their hits, called \"The Collection\".\n\nIn 2003, Aad Ouberg, who was closely involved with the group, was responsible for getting a Dolly Dots musical off the ground. The musical \"Love Me Just a Little Bit More\" played at The Chassé Theatre in Breda and around the Netherlands during 2004.\n\nAs result of renewed interest in the group after the musical, Warner Bros. Records released a Dolly Dots greatest hits compilation album of the group as well as a DVD. In 2007, all six original members reunited for a series of guest performances during \"Vrienden van Amstel Live\". Their success there led to three concerts of their own in Ahoy Rotterdam. The DVD of those concerts reached gold status in the Netherlands. In 2008, a tour followed, called 'Goodbye for Now'.\n\nRia Brieffies, who went on to pursue culinary interests, was diagnosed with cancer in November 2008; she died on July 20, 2009. Angela Groothuizen announced that without Brieffies, the Dolly Dots would never perform again.\n\nIn 2011, Anita Heilker made her comeback as a solo artist in a Dutch show called \"The Winner Is...\"\n\nThe remaining five members made a comeback as guest artists with the Toppers in May 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as a co-founder of Tears for Fears, of which he is the main songwriter and joint vocalist, but he has also achieved success as a producer of other artists including Oleta Adams and Emiliana Torrini. In 2014, Orzabal published his first novel. \n\nOrzabal was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire. Initially raised in Havant, his family later moved to Bath where he attended Culverhay School and became a member of the Zenith Youth Theatre Company.\n\nOrzabal's mother is English and his father (George Orzabal de la Quintana) is from Paris, France, of Spanish-Basque descent. Roland's grandfather, Arturo Orzabal de la Quintana, was from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and son of emigrants from the Basque Country. Orzabal was named Raoul for the first two weeks after his birth, but this was changed to Roland to anglicise the name as the family was living in England. When Orzabal was three years old, his father had a nervous breakdown which left him semi-bedridden for a large portion of Orzabal's childhood. His father decided to run an entertainment business with his mother, a dancer, resulting in different entertainers often hanging around Orzabal's home. He describes his childhood as \"unorthodox,\" and it inspired various Tears for Fears songs, particularly on \"The Hurting\".\n\nOrzabal met Curt Smith while both were in their early teens in Bath, Somerset. In the late-1970s, they formed a mod music group, Graduate, along with three other members. Following the release of their debut album, \"Acting My Age\", the group disbanded and Orzabal and Smith went on to form Tears for Fears, a new wave/synthpop outfit directly inspired by the writings of the American psychologist Arthur Janov.\n\nAfter a decade of major international success, Orzabal and Smith acrimoniously split in the early 1990s. Orzabal continued to work as Tears for Fears after he and Smith parted ways; the subsequent albums \"Elemental\" (1993) and \"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\" (1995) are effectively solo works by him in all but name. \"Elemental\" was a success being certified as Gold status in the US and Silver in the UK, while \"Raoul\" took a more artistic direction but garnered less chart success. In 2001 he released his first proper solo album, \"Tomcats Screaming Outside\", under his own name. Orzabal and Smith had reconciled by that point and were working together on Tears for Fears's next album, \"Everybody Loves a Happy Ending\" (2004).\n\nAs a songwriter, Orzabal is a two-time Ivor Novello Award winner. His first award was in 1986 for \"Songwriter of the Year\" following the release of Tears for Fears' second album \"Songs from the Big Chair\" for which Orzabal wrote or co-wrote all of the tracks.\n\nOrzabal, with Curt Smith are responsible for discovering musician and songwriter Oleta Adams, whom they brought into the band and who sang on the single Woman in Chains from the 1989 Tears for Fears album \"The Seeds of Love\" as a duet with Orzabal. Orzabal co-produced Oleta Adams' album \"Circle of One\" (1990). The album reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 20 in the US, and featured her transatlantic top ten hit \"Get Here\". Orzabal also co-wrote the lead track \"Rhythm of Life\" for the album, which was originally intended for \"The Seeds of Love\". As well as playing guitar and singing backing vocals on the track, he also appeared in the song's accompanying promo video.\n\nIn 1999, Orzabal co-produced the Icelandic singer-songwriter Emiliana Torrini's album \"Love in the Time of Science\", along with Tears for Fears associate Alan Griffiths. The pair also wrote two tracks for the album.\n\nOrzabal's talents as a songwriter were recognised again after Michael Andrews and Gary Jules recorded the song \"Mad World\" for the film soundtrack \"Donnie Darko\" in 2001. Their version was released as a single in 2003 and became the Christmas number one single in the UK that year, ultimately becoming the year's biggest selling single. The song was originally composed by Orzabal and was Tears for Fears' first hit single in 1982. In 2004, the song won Orzabal his second Ivor Novello Award, as the songwriter of the Best Selling UK Single of 2003.\n\nOrzabal has written a novel, a romantic comedy entitled \"Sex, Drugs & Opera\", published in 2014. It tells the story of a middle-aged pop star, Solomon Capri, who is semi-retired but is approached to take part in the reality show \"Popstar to Operastar\" which he sees as a way to rejuvenate his career and his waning marriage. The story was inspired by Orzabal's own experience as he was approached by the ITV show himself, though did not take part.\n\nIn 1985, Orzabal gained considerable press attention for his strained relationship with his father and a humorous cartoon was printed in the UK tabloid \"The Sun\" pertaining to this. The cartoon was later reprinted within the cover artwork for the Tears for Fears single \"I Believe\".\n\nOrzabal married Caroline (née Johnston) at Bath Register Office in 1982. The couple have two sons, born in 1991 and 1994. Caroline can be heard singing the child vocal on the Tears for Fears song \"Suffer the Children\" from the band's debut album \"The Hurting\", and also drew the \"hands\" cover artwork for the 1983 re-release of \"Pale Shelter\".\n\nIn July 2017, Caroline died from natural causes and Tears for Fears initially withdrew from the remaining shows on the North American tour they were co-headlining with Hall & Oates, citing a family emergency. Roland and Tears for Fears resumed the tour on 14 September 2017, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the final film for George Sherman in a directing career of more than 30 years. It grossed $7.5 million in the US.\n\nIn 1909, there is a raid on the McCandles family ranch by a gang of ruthless outlaws led by John Fain. They massacre the ranch hands and kidnap Little Jake, the grandson, leaving a ransom note and heading back for Mexico, where they have been hiding out. Martha, the head of the family, is offered the help of both the army and the Texas Rangers in hunting the gang. She replies that this will be \"a harsh and unpleasant kind of business and will require an extremely harsh and unpleasant kind of person to see it through.\" In consequence, she sends for her estranged husband, the aging Jacob \"Big Jake\" McCandles, a near-legendary gunfighter who wanders the west with his Rough Collie, simply named Dog.\n\nWhen Jake arrives by train, he and Martha discuss a plan to take the ransom to the kidnappers, a million dollars in a big red strongbox, although Jake warns that, \"Pay or not, we run the risk of never seeing the boy again\". Then his son, Michael, rides up on a motorcycle, bringing word that he has seen the kidnappers in the Chilicothe Canyon. The Texas Ranger captain is present and offers the services of his men, equipped with three touring cars. They, however, are ambushed and their cars put out of action. Jake, preferring the old ways, has followed on horseback, accompanied by an old Apache associate, Sam Sharpnose. He is now joined by his sons, Michael and James, with whom his relations are tense because of his desertion of the family ten years before.\n\nThat night, Fain rides into their camp to make arrangements for the handover, telling Jake that they will “send the boy's body back in a basket\" if anything should go wrong. Both men deny any personal stake in the business, each claiming to be \"just a messenger boy\". The family party crosses into Mexico the next day and checks into a hotel. Knowing that they have been followed by another gang intent on stealing the strongbox, Jake sets a trap for them and they are all killed. During the attack, the chest is blasted open, revealing clipped bundles of newspaper instead of money. Michael and James become suspicious of Jake and they all slug it out, but Jake assures them that it was both his and Martha's idea. James fears for Little Jake's life, but Jake tells them they'll have to go in anyway.\n\nA thunderstorm breaks and Pop Dawson, one of the outlaws, arrives to give them the details of the exchange. He warns them that a sniper will have a gun trained on Little Jake in case of a double-cross. Jake arranges for Michael to follow after them to take care of the sharp shooter and convinces Dawson that he had been killed in the fight. At the hideout, Jake is led in alone to where Fain and four other gang members are waiting, one holding a shotgun on Little Jake. Jake tosses the key to the chest to Fain, who opens it to discover that he has been tricked.\n\nFain orders his brother, Will, to kill Little Jake but he is shot by Jake. Dog is wounded by the sniper and Jake is wounded in the leg before Michael kills him. Jake tells Little Jake to escape but he is hunted by the machete wielding John Goodfellow, who has already hacked Sam to death. Dog comes to the rescue and is himself killed before Jake arrives and impales Goodfellow on a pitchfork. Fain rides up and is preparing to finish them off when Michael arrives from where he had been waiting in ambush and blasts him off his horse. Before he dies, Fain asks, \"Who are you?\" When Jake answers, \"Jacob McCandles,\" Fain says, \"I thought you was dead,\" as have other characters during the course of the film. “Not hardly,\" Jake replies.\n\nWith Little Jake rescued, and the broken family bonded, they prepare to head home.\n\n\nWritten as \"The Million Dollar Kidnapping\", which was used as the shooting title, it was filmed from early October to early December 1970, in the Mexican states of Durango and Zacatecas, including scenes shot at the El Saltito waterfall and in the Sierra de Órganos National Park.\n\nJohn Wayne's son, Patrick, portrays James McCandles. Robert Mitchum's son, Christopher, portrays Michael McCandles. Wayne's youngest son, Ethan, portrays Little Jake.\n\nHoward Thompson of \"The New York Times\" encouraged theatergoers to \"stick it out\" until the exciting climax, which the rest of the film was a \"long prelude\" to that \"simply jogs along fairly tediously on the rescue trail, with the star being his laconic self, plus conventional spurts of violence, likewise the saddle humor.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and wrote, \"With a little bit of restraint, the latest John Wayne Western, 'Big Jake,' might have been one of the veteran star's recent best. The most obvious excess, and this is unusual for a John Wayne film, is violence.\" Arthur D. Murphy of \"Variety\" wrote that the film had \"[a]n above-average script, plus excellent direction by vet George Marshall and superior photography by William Clothire on Mexican locations,\" but was \"gratuitously violent far beyond the legitimate requirements of the action plot.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated, \"To say that 'Big Jake] is a typical John Wayne western is pretty much to say it all. His fans should be well-satisfied with its tried and true combination of action and comedy. 'Big Jake' is scarcely distinguished but is certainly enjoyable.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"a rather insufferable sort of 'typical' Wayne vehicle\" with \"an undercurrent of vindictiveness that spoils the ostensible humor. It's obvious that young actors are needed to appeal to younger viewers and to perform the kinds of physical action that require youth and dexterity and that Wayne is just too visibly massive and slow to accomplish these days—but they're treated almost exclusively as stooges ... There's no good reason why the young leads in a Wayne picture shouldn't be allowed to function with at least as much importance and dignity as Ricky Nelson in 'Rio Bravo' or the young actor who played opposite Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott in 'Ride the High Country' or, better yet, Montgomery Clift in 'Red River.'\" Allen Eyles of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" declared, \"Another genial celebration of Big John's ability to carry a film practically single-handed. Although supported by the group of dependables who usually appear in his films, as well as by a good proportion of his family, it is the Wayne personality—carefully catered for by the script—that accounts for most of the pleasure.\"\n\n\"Big Jake\" was released to DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment on April 29, 2003 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and on May 31, 2011 as a Region 1 widescreen Blu-ray DVD.\n\n\n"}

The monks did not come directly from Ireland, but came instead from Scots Monastery in Regensburg, Germany. Since 1625, the abbey has been a member of the Austrian Congregation, now within the Benedictine Confederation.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, Irish monks were actively involved in missionary work. Ireland was known in Latin as \"Scotia Major\"; therefore, in German, Irish monks were called \"\"Schotten\"\" (Scots) or \"\"Iroschotten\"\". The monasteries that they founded were called \"\"Schottenklöster\"\". In the foundation documents of the Schottenstift, Henry II specified that it was to be occupied exclusively by these \"Iroschotten\" (\"Solos elegimus Scottos\").\n\nHenry II was elevated from the rank of Margrave (\"Markgraf\") to that of Duke (\"Herzog\") in 1156. He moved his residence from Klosterneuburg to Vienna and required a monastery for his new city. In the Middle Ages, monasteries were not only places for prayer, but also and above all, repositories of knowledge. The foundation of a monastery gave the ruler support for his administration (for example, schools to educate competent scribes). It also provided a library, a hospice and old age home, architects, educated men, and priests to conduct services in the new ducal city. The \"\"Schotten\"\" would also be involved with the University of Vienna, which was founded in 1365.\n\nHenry granted the new monastery extensive privileges. Construction of the first monastery started in 1160, and the structure was consecrated in 1200. The monastery was outside the city walls of Vienna. The monks also built a hospice for pilgrims and crusaders, who often passed through Vienna on their way to Jerusalem.\n\nThe first church was a three-aisled, Romanesque, pillar church with a single apse. Henry II was buried there upon his death in 1177.\n\nA fire in the year 1276 destroyed the cloister, along with many other buildings in Vienna.\n\nIn 1418, Duke Albert V seized the cloister during the Melker Reform, an attempt to revive the original ideals of Benedictine monasticism, and settled a community of Benedictines in their place. These new residents, however, continued to be known as the \"\"Schotten\"\".\n\nIn the middle of the 15th century, the monastery was distinguished through the literary activities of its schoolmaster, Wolfgang Schmeltzl, and his successor, Johannes Rasch.\nThe collapse of the tower, struck by a lightning bolt in 1638, was seized as an opportunity to completely rebuild the church, a project undertaken by the architects Andrea d'Allio the Younger and Silvestro Carlone. The church was somewhat shortened, and the tower no longer stood directly beside the basilica. Joachim von Sandrart provided the church with a new altar piece, which today is kept in the prelates' hall. After the Turkish siege, the church was restored. As the Baroque west tower was barely higher than the façade itself, its extension has often been proposed, but this has never come to fruition.\n\nAround 1700 the great Baroque musician Johann Fux was the organist at the Schottenstift.\n\nIn 1773 and 1774, a new priory, with school, was built by Andreas Zach in the grounds of an open air cemetery. As it resembled a piece of furniture, it became popularly known as the \"Schubladkastenhaus\" (\"the chest-of-drawers house\"). Directly next door stood the \"Hotel Römischer Kaiser\", where the first public performance of a song by Franz Schubert was held.\n\nIn 1807 the \"Schottengymnasium\", an institute for secondary education, was founded by imperial decree.\n\nAround 1830, the auxiliary buildings of the Abbey, in particular those that bordered on the Freyung, were renovated and partially rebuilt by Joseph Kornhäusel.\n\nIn the 1880s the church was restored and partially renovated. From this period date the ceiling paintings by Julius Schmid, and a new high altar, built from sketches by Heinrich von Ferstel, with a mosaic by Michael Rieser.\n\nIn the court, there is a \"Schwarze Muttergottes\" (a \"Black Madonna\"), designed in 1825 by Peter Nobile. The fountain, with a statue of Henry II, is the work of Sebastian Wagner.\n\nThe museum has been reinstalled twice in recent history, in 1994/95 and in 2004/5. It contains, among other notable items, the \"Schottenmeisteraltar\" from ca. 1470, which is not only a significant work of late Gothic art, but also an important historical source, on account of its views of the city.\n\nOpen on Thursday until Friday, 11 am to 5 pm, and Saturday, 11 am to 4.30 pm. Guided Tour on Saturday, 2.30 pm (church, crypt, library and museum).\n\nThe Schottenstift is located on the Freyung (Freyung 6, A-1010 Wien) in Vienna, Austria.\n\n"}

They are seldom used for the description of other languages even though a distinction between vowels that usually have to be followed by a consonant and other vowels is common in most Germanic languages.\n\nThe terms \"checked vowel\" and \"free vowel\" correspond closely to the terms \"lax vowel\" and \"tense vowel\" respectively, but many linguists prefer to use the terms \"checked\" and \"free\", as there is no clearcut phonetic definition of vowel tenseness and because by most attempted definitions of tenseness and are considered lax even though they behave in American English as free vowels.\n\n\"Checked vowels\" is also used to refer to a kind of very short glottalized vowels found in some Zapotecan languages that contrast with laryngealized vowels. The term \"checked vowel\" is also used to refer to a short vowel followed by a glottal stop in Mixe, which has a distinction between two kinds of glottalized syllable nuclei: checked ones, with the glottal stop after a short vowel, and nuclei with rearticulated vowels, a long vowel with a glottal stop in the middle.\n\nIn English, the checked vowels are the following:\n\nThere are a few exceptions, mostly in interjections: \"eh\" with ; \"duh\", \"huh\", \"uh\", \"uh-uh\", and \"uh-huh\" with ; \"nah\" with . There are also the onomatopoeia \"baa\" for and the loanword \"pho\" for when pronounced in American English. The proper names \"Graham\" and \"Flaherty\" are sometimes pronounced with a prevocalic .\n\nThe free vowels are the following:\n\nThe schwa and rhotacized schwa are usually considered neither free nor checked because they cannot stand in stressed syllables.\n\nThe term \"checked vowel\" is also useful in the description of English spelling. As free written vowels \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\" correspond to the spoken vowels , , , , ; as checked vowels \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\" correspond to , , , , . In spelling free and checked vowels are often called long and short, based on their historical pronunciation, though nowadays some or all of the free vowels are diphthongs, depending on the dialect, not long vowels as such. Written consonant doubling often shows the vowel is checked; the \"i\" of \"dinner\" corresponds to checked because of the double consonants \"nn\"; the \"i\" of \"diner\" corresponds to free because of the single consonant \"n\". This, however, interferes with the differences in doubling rules between American and British styles of spelling, say \"travelled\" versus \"traveled\". Similarly, a \"silent\"e\"\" following a single consonant at the end of a word often indicates that the preceding vowel is free where it would otherwise be checked; for example, the \"a\" of \"tap\" corresponding to whereas that in \"tape\" corresponds to .\n\n"}
{"id": "2232537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232537", "title": "Aventicum", "text": "Aventicum\n\nAventicum was the largest town and capital of Roman Switzerland (Helvetia or Civitas Helvetiorum). Its remains are beside the modern town of Avenches.\n\nThe city was probably created \"ex nihilo\" in the early 1st century AD, as the capital of the recently conquered territory of the Helvetii, across the road that connected Italy to Britain, built under Claudius. Under the rule of Emperor Vespasian, who grew up there, Aventicum was raised to the status of a \"colonia\" in 72 AD, whereupon it entered its golden age. The town wall was long but was impracticable for defensive purposes and was doubtless intended as a display of the status of the city.\n\nIn the Christian era Aventicum was the seat of a bishopric. The most famous of its bishops was Marius Aventicensis. His terse chronicle, spanning the years 455 to 581, is one of the few sources for the 6th-century Burgundians. Shortly after the Council of Macon, in 585, Marius moved the seat from Aventicum, due to the rapid decline of the city, to Lausanne.\n\nThe area around Aventicum was occupied before the Romans founded the city. There have been numerous lake-dwellings such as, Lacustre, discovered within the adjoining Lake Murten, with at least 16 stilt house settlements having been found. In the largest site, the piles extend over an area of thus forming a large station or village. A great number of objects have been found buried in the mud amongst the piles, consisting of implements of stone and bone, such as hatchets, chisels, needles, awls, besides a vast quantity of the bones of animals. The pottery is a coarse, dark red kind of earthenware containing numerous grains of quartz, and there are 12 or 15 varieties.\n\nThe Helvetii probably reached southern Germany around the year 111 BC and soon invaded Gaul. During their invasion of the Roman Provincia Narbonensis they defeated a Roman army under L. Cassius Longinus near Agendicum in 107 BC and killed the consul. They continued to march into Spain, Gaul, Noricum, and northern Italy. Suffering defeats in the year 102-101 BC the surviving Helvetii retreated across the Alps.\n\nIn 58 BC the nobleman Orgetorix instigated a new Helvetian migration, in which the entire tribe was to leave their territory (which is now described as corresponding more or less to the Swiss plateau) and establish supremacy over all of Gaul. They marched from their villages, but were stalled by Julius Caesar on the banks of the Rhône. The Helvetii then marched around and across the Jura Mountains, to an area near the Aeduan oppidum Bibracte. There Caesar caught up and defeated the Helvetii in the Battle of Bibracte. This resulted in the Helvetii’s retreat and the capture of most of their baggage by the Romans. Following their surrender the Helvetii became \"foederati\", an allied \"civitas\" required to provide soldiers, but not granted Roman citizenship.\n\nThe Helvetii likely lost their status as \"foederati\" six years later, when they supported Vercingetorix in 52 BC. Sometime between 50 and 45 BC, the Romans founded the \"Colonia Iulia Equestris\" at the site of the Helvetian settlement \"Noviodunum\" (modern Nyon). This colony was most likely established as a means for controlling one of the two important military access routes between the Helvetian territory and the rest of Gaul, blocking passage through the Rhône valley and the Sundgau.\n\nDuring the following half century, the Helvetii would become increasingly romanized. During this time, there were two settlements near where Aventicum would be founded. The first was the oppidum on Mont Vully between Lake Murten and Lake Neuchatel, which was given up in the 1st century BC. The second was the Bois de Châtel, which was fortified in the second half of the 1st century BC. The Bois de Châtel would be destroyed early in the 1st century AD and the population moved to Aventicum.\n\nIn the course of Augustus’ reign (27 BC - 14 AD), Roman dominance became more concrete. Some of the traditional Celtic \"oppida\" were now used as legionary garrisons, or relocated. While the exact date of the founding of Aventicum is not exact, it was likely established during or shortly after Augustus' reign.\n\nBy 5 AD there was a dock on the shore of Lake Murten, which is the first evidence of a settlement at Aventicum. A grave has also been discovered in the city that dates to 15 AD. During that time there was a small settlement built, in the north east corner of modern Avenches, in the Roman square style. However this site can only be dated to the reign of Tiberius (14 - 37 AD). Aventicum would have grown in 16-17 AD as the Roman legion camp Vindonissa was built in Windisch, Canton Aargau. Aventicum was a major location on the Roman road from Lausanne to Vindonissa.\n\nDuring the reign of Claudius (41 - 54 AD) a trade route was completed spanning from Italy to the recently conquered province of Britannia over the Gotthard Pass. This route passed through Aventicum allowing the city to expand.\n\nIt later became part of \"Germania Superior\" and then part of the Diocletian province of \"Maxima Sequanorum\". The former territories of the Helvetii and their inhabitants were, by this time, as romanised as the rest of Gaul.\n\nIn the 1st century AD Aventicum and the Helvetii land was incorporated into the Roman province of \"Gallia Belgica\". Tacitus, writing about AD. 69, speaks of the Helvetians as originally a Gallic people, renowned for their valour and exploits in war, and he designates Aventicum \"Caput gentis\", or capital of Helvetia. It acquired this title most probably on account of its comparatively advanced state of civilization and its conspicuous position on the main route between Italy and Germany. It was also the centre of a network of well used military roads. Aventicum and Nyon (\"Colonia Equestris\") located on the shores of Lake Geneva were the starting points for all mile-stones in Helvetia.\n\nDuring the first three-quarters of the 1st century AD, Aventicum became a center of the Imperial Cult in the Civitas Helvetiorum. However the Helvetii came into conflict once more with Rome shortly after the death of emperor Nero in 68 AD. Like the other Gallic tribes, the Helvetii were organised as a \"civitas\" and enjoyed a certain inner autonomy, including the defence of certain strongholds by their own troops. In the civil war and Year of Four Emperors which followed Nero’s death, the \"civitas Helvetiorum\" supported Galba; unaware of his death, they refused to accept the authority of his rival, Vitellius. The Legio XXI Rapax, stationed in Vindonissa and favouring Vitellius, stole the pay of a Helvetian garrison, which prompted the Helvetians to intercept the messengers and detain a Roman detachment. Aulus Caecina Alienus, a former supporter of Galba who was now at the head of a Vitellian invasion of Italy, launched a massive punitive campaign, crushing the Helvetii at Mount Vocetius, killing and enslaving thousands. Aventicum was then besieged and quickly surrendered. The city was nearly ordered destroyed by the Romans but owing to the pleas of one Claudius Cossus, a Helvetian envoy to Vitellius, and, as Tacitus puts it, “of well-known eloquence” the city was spared.\n\nDuring the Year of Four Emperors (69 AD) Vitellius, who nearly ordered Aventicum destroyed, was the third. The fourth, Vespasian, had a much more positive influence on Aventicum. While he was born in Falacrina, in the Sabine country near Reate. His father, Titus Flavius Sabinus, was a banker on a small scale in Aventicum, where Vespasian lived for some time. About two years after Vespasian was declared emperor, he raised Aventicum to the status of a \"colonia\" granting exceptional civic status. A colonia was a town that was a specific residential location for legionaries who upon retirement were granted land and became citizens. This encouraged land development and stability and not least the extension of Roman \"culture\". Previously, Aventicum had been the capital of a non-citizen nation. The increased prestige that being a \"colonia\" brought ushered in a golden age for Aventicum. During this time Aventicum was known as \"Pia Flavia Constans Emerita\".\n\nThe Alemanni sacked the city in the 280s, and neither Aventicum nor its hinterland recovered from both the impact of the attack and the subsequent changes of the Roman frontier which no longer granted security to the area. By the collapse of Rome in the 5th century, this area was already fully under the control of Germanic tribes whose dialects became the basis for Swiss German. In the 6th century some Christian life continued in the acropolis of the Roman town- the amphitheatre became a fortress as did the theatre. By the 7th century, however, the focus of the church had moved to Lausanne, Aventicum is only mentioned as an old ruined city though it had fallen into ruins previously. Over the following centuries it is mentioned but always as ruins. In 1710 Marquard Wild was the first to argue that Aveticum had been the capital of Helvetia, and not Antre as was formerly believed. In 1783-86 the Marquess of Northampton led an archeological expedition to Aventicum and in 1788 he put his discoveries on display. His discoveries encouraged many treasure seekers to travel to Aventicum to search for artifacts. In response to the finds, the Musée Vespasien was opened in 1824. In 1838 it was taken over by the Canton of Vaud, renamed the Roman Museum, and installed in the tower of the Amphitheatre. In 1884 the association Pro Aventico was founded with a goal of discovering and preserving the ruins. Aventicum was a well-known location in the Grand Tour and Joseph William Mallord Turner made a drawing of the \"Cigognier\", which shows the old town behind. Archaeology benefitted curiously from the first and second world wars when foreigners interned in Switzerland, and local unemployed, were engaged to excavate the main buildings of the Roman city and to renovate and open to the public the theatre, \"Cigognier\" and the gates and one tower of the wall. With the advent of the national highway scheme in the late 1960s a programme of rescue archaeology was set up under the association \"Pro Aventico\" under the remarkably capable direction of Professor Hans Bogli, after whom the Roman museum has since been named. Early work uncovered the Forum and associated temple area including a possible \"Capitolium\". In 1985 during the construction of the A1 highway, further portions of the Roman town were discovered. In 1987 the road was moved to avoid the site. Further and extensive work over the succeeding decades opened up much of the insulae- the rectangular street system of the focus of the Roman town. Much of the area within the walls was not a densely occupied city at all, but rather, like Rome itself, was occupied by \"urban villas', large houses surrounded by substantial tracts of garden and small-holdings. The more recent work also uncovered a remarkable palace building, much of the centre of the Roman town, and outside the walls a canal and roadway leading from the nearby lake, doubtless assisting in the transport of stone from the Jura by lake and canal, and cemeteries and aqueducts outside the line of the Roman walls. Pro Aventico is also responsible for the constant round of restoration of the buildings opened up in the early part of the 20th century, including sections of the wall and the original Roman tower-raised and protected through its use as a mediaeval watch tower, and the northern gate.\n\nNear to the line of the Roman walls, and benefitting from reuse of stone from the walls is the small Romanesque church in Donatyre which possesses excellent early 12th century fresco paintings.\n\nThe Amphitheatre, as was common in the Roman Empire, was used for gladiator and animal combat as well as staged hunts. It served political, social and religious purposes and was a central feature of most Roman towns. As the capital city, the amphitheatre in Aventicum was quite large.\n\nIt was built in two stages, first about 130 AD then expanded around 165 AD. The first amphitheatre was built when the hillside was terraced. The arena floor was laid out and flattened. This first structure had 24 rows of seats built mostly of wood rising up the hillside. The stairs, the wall around the arena floor, the upper walls, and the entrances were built of stone. The outer walls of the amphitheatre measured and the arena floor was . The first amphitheatre could hold about 9,000 people.\n\nThe second phase expanded the amphitheatre considerably. A total of 31 rows of stone seats were built, which increased the capacity to about 16,000. The walls were expanded and alcoves were added. On the east side a monumental main portal was built out of massive stone cubes. The expanded amphitheatre was (without the outer courtyard or the east main portal) , while the arena floor remained the same size. The outer walls were high.\n\nDuring the 4th century the amphitheater was abandoned and much of the structure was removed and used as construction material. In the 11th century the Bishop of Lausanne had a tower house built over the east entrance, starting at about the 20th row of benches. This tower is now the home of the Roman Museum.\n\nThe theatre was built during the early 2nd century in an area that was previously occupied by scattered houses. It was rebuilt and renovated numerous times, though details are unclear. In the last third of the 3rd century it was rebuilt as a fortified refuge and a moat was added. It was used for this purpose until the middle of the 4th century.\n\nThe theatre is built in the style of a classical Roman theatre, but does have some Gallo-Roman modifications. Both the Orchestra and the Cavea (spectator seating) are nearly horseshoe shaped. The actual stage is a simple wooden platform. The \"scaenae frons\" or background wall had three doors leading to the relatively small () stage building (\"postscaenium\") which is built projecting out behind the wall. The \"scaenae frons\" was built with a gap in the wall which showed the Cigognier Temple to the audience. The theatre was used for comedies and tragedies, but there is also a \"cult niche\" at the foot of the audience's section with the stage forming an altar. This indicates that the theatre may have also been used for \"dedicating plays\" for religious ceremonies.\n\nThe theatre is wide and deep. The orchestra area is across and deep. The capacity of the theatre was about 12,000 people, with over 50 rows for seating. It was entered through 11 \"vomitoria\" (covered entrances) which each had two arched passageways. At the bottom of the spectators seating there was a wide box for the nobility.\n\nThe name of the temple (\"Cigognier\") comes from a stork's nest that had occupied the top of a pillar since at least 1642. The nest was removed during a restoration in 1978, but the name has remained.\n\nThe Cigognier Temple was built as a massive and impressive temple and may have been the chief temple of the Imperial Cult in the entire \"civitas Helvetiorum\" state. At the temple the Roman Empire, symbolized by the divine Emperor, would be worshipped by the citizens and inhabitants of the state. Supporting this theory, a gold bust of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius was found hidden in drains on the site of the temple. Additionally, the temple was laid out in the same manner as the \"Templum Pacis\" in Rome. Finally, the temple was built near the Theatre, which also may have had a role in the worship of the Emperor.\n\nThe temple was started in 98AD, the first year of the reign of Emperor Trajan, according to dendrochronological analysis of the numerous oak posts that support the walls. It appears that the temple wasn't part of the original plan of Aventicum and so it may have been added under the direction of Trajan. Trajan had served with the Roman army along the Rhine, and after his ascension to the throne may have had the temple built to represent his power over the northern reaches of the Empire.\n\nThe temple was built with a wide inner courtyard with an avenue running along the long axis. The eight pillaredportico of the temple rose high above the north courtyard. The actual temple was built on a high podium with a neighboring seating area hall, with three rows of seats. A wall surrounded the entire complex except toward the south which formed the outer courtyard. The wall had a gate that connected the temple to the Theatre and the new, main east-west road in the city.\n\nThe Cigognier Temple is the largest temple in Aventicum. The outer dimensions were . The temple was , the height of the roof peak was of which is the height of the podium. The hall for the seating area was and the roof height was , also with a podium. The outer courtyard was .\n\nThe Roman Temple of the Grange-des-Dîmes dates from the end of the 1st or the early 2nd century. It was built on the site of an earlier 1st-century gallic chapel. The temple is built in a typical Roman fashion, however the cella is nearly square instead of a more rectangular shape. The Temple is raised above the ground on a podium. The cella was surrounded by pillars and the entrance was crowned with a pediment. Inside the temple there was an altar, a fountain and four pillars that supported a canopy over a statue.\n\nThe temple was, most likely, dedicated to the Gallo-Roman god Mercurius Cissonius, a syncretic combination of Mercury and the gallic god Cissonius. The temple worships Mercury as the god of travellers and trade and being located on the main street through the city would have been visited by both. Its close proximity to the Cigognier Temple, the center of worship for the Imperial Cult, indicates that this temple was also an important one.\n\nThe temple is partly restored. A section of the foundation of the south wall of the cella, originally , and part of the podium, originally , are visible today. While the stairs leading up the podium are gone, the location of the altar and the fountain as well as the partially reconstructed canopy are also visible on the podium. The rear of the podium is on the north side of the Avenue Jomini. The rest of the temple site is covered by the Avenue, though the floor plan of the temple is laid out in stones embedded in the road. Based on reconstructions, many of the dimensions of the temple are known. The podium was high, with a cella that was about high and covered with a four sided roof. The cella is surrounded by a narrow colonnaded portico facade with pillars that are in diameter, high and the trusses above the pillars were thick. The entrance to the temple was set off with 4 pillars ( in diameter).\n\nThe main road through Aventicum ran from east to west. The east gate was built during the reign of Vespasian. The gate was built to protect and control the road before the city walls were built.\n\nThe Baths (known as \"Thermen von En Perruet\" or Baths at the Forum) were located directly east of the Forum of Aventicum. They were built during the expansion to a colony, sometime after 77 AD. They were financed by a wealthy romanized Helvetii family known as the Camilli.\n\n\n"}

Shortly afterwards, Lāčplēsis becomes friends with another hero, Koknesis (\"Wood-bearer\"), and they study together at the Castle of Burtnieks, Laimdota's father.\n\nKangars provokes a war with the Estonians, and Lāčplēsis sets out to fight the giant Kalapuisis ( (the \"Kalapuisis\" name is derived from \"kalapoiss\"), probably refers to the hero of the Estonian epic poem Kalevipoeg), to win the hand of Laimdota. He defeats the giant, and the two make peace and decide to join forces to fight their common enemy, the German missionaries, led by the priest Dietrich (Dītrihs). Lāčplēsis performs another heroic deed by spending the night in a sunken castle, breaking the curse and allowing the castle to rise into the air again. Laimdota and Lāčplēsis are engaged. In the following episodes, Laimdota reads from the old books about the Creation and ancient Latvian teachings.\n\nLaimdota and Koknesis are kidnapped and imprisoned in Germany. Spīdala convinces Lāčplēsis that Laimdota and Koknesis are lovers. Lāčplēsis returns home to Lielvārde, then sets sail for Germany. His ship becomes lost in the Northern Sea, and he is welcomed by the daughter of the North Wind. In the meantime, Dietrich and the Livonian prince Caupo of Turaida meet with the Pope in Rome to plan the Christianization of Latvia. Lāčplēsis begins his dangerous journey home from the Northern Sea. He fights monsters with three, six, and nine heads on the Enchanted Island. Finally, he encounters Spīdala on the island, and frees her from her contract with the Devil. Lāčplēsis is reunited with Laimdota and Koknesis, who escaped from Germany but were then trapped on the Enchanted Island. Koknesis declares his love for Spīdala, and the four friends return to Latvia.\n\nA double wedding is celebrated during the Jāņi (Midsummer festivities), but the heroes soon set off to fight the German crusaders. After several battles, the Germans are pushed back, and their leader, Bishop Albert, brings reinforcements from Germany, including the Black Knight. At Dietrich's bidding, Kangars finds out the secret of Lāčplēsis' strength and treacherously reveals it to the Germans: Lāčplēsis' mother was a she-bear, and his superhuman strength resides in his bear ears. The German knights come to Lielvārde offering to make peace. Lāčplēsis organizes a friendly tournament, during which he is goaded into fighting the Black Knight. The knight cuts off Lāčplēsis' ears. Lāčplēsis, still, having not yet completely lost his strength, explodes in anger and lifts the Knight, to throw him in the river from a cliff. But the two combatants fall into Daugava river, because the Knight, when thrown, grabs Lāčplēsis, and they both disappear into the water. In the same moment Laimdota's life ends.\n\n\nFrom the time of the Northern Crusades in the early 13th century, most of the land in Courland was owned by nobles descended from the German invaders. In 1863, the Russian authorities issued laws to enable Latvians, who formed the bulk of the population, to acquire the farms which they held, and special banks were founded to help them. By this means, some occupants bought their farms, but the great mass of the population remained landless, and lived as hired laborers, occupying a low position in the social scale. This was the situation prevailing at the time of writing – thus, the strongly negative presentation of these German invaders had clear contemporary implications for the writer's own time.\n\n\n\n"}

On some variants, the rear of the canopy could be opened for a gunner to fire to the rear. A variety of air-cooled radial engines, including the Wright Whirlwind, Pratt & Whitney Wasp and Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior of varying horsepowers, could be installed depending on customer preferences. The fuselage was built up from steel tubes and normally fabric covered; however, later versions were provided with aluminium monocoque structures.\n\nDuring the development of the design, a six-inch stretch was made by moving the rudder post aft. Many versions had a fixed landing gear, but later versions could have retractable gear, mounted in a widened wing center section (which could have either integral fuel tanks or not). Most had a straight trailing edge on the outer wing while again, some had the wing trailing edge swept forward slightly in an attempt to fix a problem with stalls and spins. Several different rudders were used, with early examples having a round outline, intermediate examples having a square bottom on the rudder (Harvard I) and late examples using the triangular rudder of the AT-6 series, due to a loss of control at high angles of attack with the early types. Horizontal and vertical tails were initially covered in corrugated aluminum, but later examples were smooth-skinned, and the horizontal stabilizer was increased in chord near its tips on later versions.\n\nThe NA-16 flew for the first time on 1 April 1935, and was submitted to the United States Army Air Corps for evaluation as a basic trainer. The Army accepted the trainer for production but with some detail changes. The modified NA-16 was redesignated by North American as the NA-18, with production examples entering Air Corps service as the North American BT-9 (NA-19). Similar aircraft continued to be sold outside the U.S. under the NA-16 designation.\n\nThe Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation produced 755 units of a modified version of the NA-16-2K known there as the Wirraway between 1939 and 1946.\n\nExperience with the NA-16-4P and deteriorating political relations with the US led to the local development of the I.Ae. D.L. 21, which shared the NA-16 fuselage structure; however it proved too difficult to produce. As a result of this, an entirely new design (the I.Ae. D.L. 22) was built instead; it had similar configuration, but was structurally different and optimized to available materials.\n\nThe NA-16-4RW and NA-16-4R inspired the development of the Kyushu K10W when the Imperial Japanese Navy instructed Kyushu to develop something similar. The resulting aircraft owed little to the NA-16, however Allied Intelligence saw so few examples that the error was not corrected and some drawings show a modified NA-16.\n\nListing includes aircraft built specifically under NA-16 designation for export, and similar aircraft built for use by the United States armed forces.\n\nWhen the North American NA-16 was first conceived, five different roles were intended for the design, designated NA-16-1 thru NA-16-5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

These cards are supposed to complement each other well within a given theme. Theme decks are also a means for newcomers to start the game with a deck instead of a random assortment of cards. Players often buy preconstructed decks and swap out some of the weaker cards for more powerful ones, gradually improving their deck. Otherwise procuring enough cards to build a deck around a coherent theme often requires a significant investment. Theme decks and intro packs are also well suited to be played against each other because they are usually similar in power level. The themes in these decks can also be a quick way to get a feel for the overarching themes in a new set.\n\nBeginning with the set in 1997, Wizards of the Coast began producing 60-card theme decks (also called preconstructed decks). Beginning with Shards of Alara in 2008 these were replaced by Intro Packs. These contain a set of 41 predetermined cards and a booster pack from the respective expansion.\n\nThe following is a list of preconstructed theme decks, sorted by product group and then chronologically.\n\n"}

The project includes a development of the Corrib gas field, and constructions of the natural gas pipeline and a gas processing plant. The project has attracted considerable opposition.\n\nThe deepwater exploration licence No. 2/93 covering four blocks in the Slyne Trough was granted on 1 January 1993 for a period of 11 years to Enterprise Oil and its partners Saga Petroleum Ireland Limited, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited, and Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Limited. The licence was issued under the licensing terms for offshore oil and gas exploration and development 1992. The Corrib natural gas field was discovered in 1996. It was the first reported commercial natural gas discovery in Ireland since the Kinsale Head gas field was discovered in 1971. The first appraisal well was drilled in 1997. A number of consents and approvals to develop the Corrib Project were issued in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Enterprise Oil was acquired by Royal Dutch Shell who took over the operatorship of the project. Development of the project began in 2004, but it was delayed in 2005 when locals opposed the project. Shell announced the suspension of the project to facilitate further discussions with opposing parties. For a year, independent safety reviews were conducted to address various safety concerns in relation to the project.\n\nIn 1999, Saga Petroleum became a part of a Norsk Hydro and in 2007 a part of Statoil. In July 2009, Vermilion Energy acquired Marathon Oil's stake in the project.\n\nUntil 2018, Royal Dutch Shell was the operator of the project with a 45% ownership stake. In 2018, Shell sold its share of the project to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board; as part of the transaction, Vermilion Energy became the project's operator and expanded its ownership share to 20%.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell proposed to develop the Corrib field as a sub-sea production facility with onshore processing. This method of development is claimed by Shell to be in line with best industry practice for gas fields of this type. The project includes development of offshore operations including the wells and subsea facilities, construction of offshore and onshore pipelines, and construction of onshore processing plant at Bellanaboy.\n\nThe Corrib gas field is located about off Erris Head in County Mayo in an area known as the Slyne Trough in water depths of . The gas is originating from Triassic Sandstone reservoir below the seabed. Reserves in the field are believed to be about , 70% the volume of the Kinsale field. The natural gas in the Corrib Gas Field is a very pure form of gas, consisting of approximately 97% methane and ethane. The Corrib gas does not contain hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide makes up only 0.3% of the total amount of gas.\n\nThe subsea production system is delivered by VetcoGray, an ABB Company. Production at the gas field will be remotely controlled from the Bellanaboy Bridge terminal. There are five production wells at the Corrib field drilled by Transocean Sedco 711 semi-submersible drilling rig. When in operation, each well is planned to have a so-called \"christmas tree\" structure above it that contains all control and monitoring equipment. Flexible individual flowlines will run from each well to a production manifold which will feed the gas into the main pipeline. There is no production platform installed in the field.\n\nThe pipeline from the Corrib field to the landfall at Glengad is planned to be approximately 90 km in length. The pipeline has a diameter of and it will operate at pressures of . Work on the offshore section occurred in summer 2009 and involved over 7,000 lengths of pipe being welded together on board the Solitaire pipelaying vessel. The onshore pipeline is still in the proposal phase but is expected to be some in length and run from landfall to the drying plant.\n\nGas will be processed at the processing plant inland near Bellanaboy Bridge. The purpose of the plant is to dry the gas and remove impurities. The plant has a capacity of 10 million standard cubic metres of purified gas per day. Processed gas will be fed to the Bord Gáis gas grid.\n\nThe piping for the Onshore Processing Plant is manufactured by Phoenix Pipes Limited in Slane, Co. Meath.\n\nSome opponents of the scheme cite concerns about the health, safety and environmental impact of the onshore aspects of the project. Others are concerned with alleged irregularities and precedents surrounding the project. Many groups, most notably the Rossport Five and Shell to Sea campaigns, oppose the current plans for the project, which they regard as dangerous despite assurances from Shell.\n\nA film about the project, \"The Pipe\" was released on 8 July 2010 at the Galway Film Festival.\n\nThe upstream high pressure gas pipeline that will connect the wells to the inland processing site is planned to run through the area of Rossport, close to local residences. A report by Dr. Richard Kupriewicz concluded that \"the terrain makes escape routes for the clustered population essentially impossible in the event of a [pipeline] rupture\".\n\nBroadhaven Bay is the proposed area to discharge waste from the refining process\n\nPlanning permission was initially refused by the board of An Bord Pleanála (the Irish planning authority). Senior planning inspector Kevin Moore’s report stated in part: \"[I]t is my submission that the proposed development of a large gas processing terminal at this rural, scenic, and unserviced area on a bogland hill some 8 kilometres inland from the Mayo coastland landfall location, with all its site development works difficulties, public safety concerns, adverse visual, ecological, and traffic impacts, and a range of other significant environmental impacts, defies any rational understanding of the term “sustainability”.\" In November 2009, An Bord Pleanála ordered Shell to redesign the pipeline and move its route away from homes saying it posed an \"unacceptable risk\".\n\nClaims of a tax yield of some €1.7 billion over the life of the field have been made by the Irish government based on data about the field's size and 2008 gas prices. Up to 2007, the Irish Petroleum Licensing Terms imposed a flat 25% income tax on gas production revenues. In August 2007, the top rate of tax on the most profitable fields was increased to 40%.\nThe new licensing terms called for changes to the tax imposed based upon fields ' profit ratios (equal to the rate of profit less 25% divided by the accumulated level of capital investment). Where this ratio is greater than 4.5, an additional 15% tax was imposed, where it is between 3.0 and 4.5 an additional 10% was imposed and where the profit ratio is between 1.5 and 3.0, and additional 5% tax was added. Less profitable fields were not affected.\n\nThe construction of the pipeline and plant was expected by Shell's economic consultants, Goodbody Economic Consultants, to create 800 temporary jobs and boost the local Mayo economy by approximately €181 million. The plant was expected by Shell to employ approximately 55 workers when operational.\n\n"}

The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Charles W. Crosse, wife of Rear Admiral Charles W. Crosse, USN. It was turned over to the Matson Navigation Company of San Francisco, California, for outfitting in October 1942. The \"Cascade\" was commissioned on 12 March 1943, Captain S. B. Ogden in command.\n\n\"Cascade\" cleared San Francisco on 12 June 1943 for Pearl Harbor, where she began her war time duty of tending destroyers. As the war moved westward, \"Cascade\" followed, bringing her support close to the action areas. From November 1943, she was stationed successively at Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Ulithi, while the ships she served ranged the Pacific, escorting convoys, screening carrier task forces, supporting invasions, and carrying out many other tasks with typical destroyer versatility. \"Cascade\" was part of Service Squadron 10.\n\nIn June 1945, \"Cascade\" sailed to Okinawa, where she endured the suicide raids and typhoon weather. She left Okinawan waters in September to serve in Wakayama, Japan and later at Tokyo, Japan, supporting the occupation until March 1946, when she sailed for the East Coast. \"Cascade\" was decommissioned and placed in service in reserve at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 12 February 1947.\n\nIn the autumn of 1943 Admiral Nimitz ordered the creation of two service squadrons. These two squadrons would provide mobile service to the fleet as it moved across the Pacific — with one service as fleet base while the second remained to the rear. As the fleet captured new sites the rear squadron would move to the front and act as fleet base.\n\nService Squadron 4 was commissioned on 1 November 1943. The squadron was made up of 24 vessels and would be based in Funafuti Atoll. The USS \"Cascade\", Captain Samuel Ogden, was the flagship for the squadron and Captain Ogden was also chief staff officer for the Squadron. The repair ships and and 21 other ships comprised the squadron. On 21 November 1943 the \"Cascade\" arrived at Funafuti where she remained until February 1944. During the stay at Funafuti the \"Cascade\" serviced numerous fleet vessels — including 10 destroyers and eight destroyer escorts.\n\nDuring this period Captain Worrall Reed Carter (USNA 1908), was organizing the second service squadron. Service Squadron 10 was commissioned on 15 January 1944 at Pearl Harbor.\n\nAfter the capture of Kwajalein in February 1944 the \"Cascade\" moved from Funafuti to Kwajalein. On 17 March 1944 Squadron 4 was absorbed into Squadron 10. Captain Herbert Meyer Scull (USNA 1919,) was reassigned as Chief of Staff for Rear Admiral Hoover, Commander Forward Area, Central Pacific. Captain Samuel Ogden in the \"Cascade\" became representative \"A\" of Commander Service Squadron 10 in command of Kwajalein and Roi.\n\nThe \"Cascade\" remained at Kwajalein until May 1944 when she moved to Eniwetok. On 5 June Commodore Carter joined SERVRON 10 at Eniwetok. His flagship was the . The following ships were also present in July 1944: destroyer tenders \"Cascade\", , and ; repair ship ; repair ship landing craft ; floating dry-docks \"ARD-13\", \"ARD-15\"; mobile floating dry-dock \"AFD-15\"; and floating workshop \"YR-30\". During July 1944 there were a large number of vessels present at Eniwetok. The daily average of ships present during the first half of July was 488; during the second half of July the daily average number of ships at Eniwetok was 283. By the end of July Commodore Carter flew to Pearl Harbor to participate in planning the move of Servron 10 facilities from Eniwetok to Ulithi.\n\nOn 4 October 1944 Service Squadron 10 began leaving Eniwetok for Ulithi. On 8 October 1944 Commodore Worrall R. Carter's flagship the \"Prairie\", the merchant ammunition ship \"Plymouth Victory\" and the \"Cascade\", Captain Herbert Kenneth Gates (USNA 1924), sailed for Ulithi. The \"Markab\" initially remained at Eniwetok, leaving for Ulithi on 18 October 1944 and arriving on 22 October. Service Squadron 10's conversion of the lagoon at Ulithi to a major naval resupply and staging area was one of the most remarkable feats of the war.\n\nOn 20 November 1944 the Ulithi harbor was attacked by Japanese kaiten human torpedoes launched from two nearby submarines. The destroyer rammed one in the early morning hours. At 5:47 the fleet oiler , at anchor in the harbor, was struck and sunk. Destroyers began dropping depth charges throughout the anchorage. At 6:25 the cruiser reported that a torpedo had passed under its bow. The destroyer escorts , , and performed an anti-submarine attack in response to the torpedo attack and reported that an enemy submarine was sunk. Another enemy submarine was sunk by an air attack some 15 miles east of Ulithi. There were two explosions on the reef which indicated the presence of additional kaiten. After the war Japanese naval officers said that two tender submarines each carrying four manned torpedoes had been sent to attack the fleet at Ulithi. Three of the suicide torpedoes were unable to launch due to mechanical problems and another ran aground on the reef. Two did make it into the lagoon, one of which sank the \"Mississinewa.\"\n\nFollowing operations at Leyte, Task Force 38 arrived at Ulithi on 24 December. Damaged ships from the force had preceded the main fleet by a few days. The repair ship had begun work on the and ; the \"Hector\" was repairing the ; the destroyer was tied up to the \"Prairie\" for repairs; the \"Cascade\" had the alongside; the was repairing the .\n\nOn 4 March 1945 the destroyers and collided while conducting night battle drills while en route to Ulithi as part of Task Group 58.1. \"Ringgold's\" bow was sheared off to frame 22 and she was extensively damaged to frame 26 port and 38 starboard. \"Yarnall's\" bow was bent to the right and upward; her bow broke off and sank during towing. Upon arrival at Ulithi the \"Ringgold\" went alongside the \"Cascade\" for installation of a temporary bow. In early April the \"Ringgold\" departed for Pearl Harbor for permanent repairs and the \"Yarnall\" left for Mare Island Navy Yard. \n\nOn 13 March 1945 there were 647 ships at anchor at Ulithi and with the arrival of amphibious forces staging at Ulithi for the invasion of Okinawa the number of ships at anchor peaked at 722. During the preparations for the Okinawa invasion the service load on Squadron 10 was extremely heavy. \n\nOn 8 March 1944 the Commander Service Squadron 10 created the Mobile Fleet Motion Picture Sub-Exchange No. 1. The \"Prairie\" operated the north exchange and the \"Cascade\" operated a branch exchange to service ships in the southern anchorage of Ulithi. The program issued 100 35-mm films and 652 16-mm films per day during December 1944.\n\nIn December 1944 a court of inquiry was held in the wardroom of the \"Cascade\", at Ulithi, regarding the loss of three ships and over 800 men from the US Third Fleet during a typhoon. The Third Fleet was under the command of William F. (Bull) Halsey, Jr. during the typhoon in mid-December 1944. Admiral Chester A. Nimitz, CINCPAC, was in attendance at the court. Forty-three-year-old Captain Herbert K. Gates, of the \"Cascade\", was the Judge Advocate for the court. Gates was an expert in mechanical and marine engineering.\n\nRecommissioned on 5 April 1951, \"Cascade\" was based in Newport, Rhode Island, as tender for the many destroyers home-ported there. From Newport she cruised to the Caribbean and the Mediterranean to support the destroyers deployed there. During this time \"Cascade\" served as flagship, and carried the flag of Commander, Service Force, 6th Fleet, and the flag of Commander, Destroyer Flotilla 6. She also served as flagship for Commander, Destroyer Force, Atlantic. She served in this role as flagship and tender up through 1963. From 1970 to 1974, the Cascade was forward deployed to the Mediterranean, homeported in Naples Italy. When was in the port of Naples \"Cascade\" was used even like a set for a scene of Italian Movie Polvere di stelle in 1973 with Alberto Sordi, Monica Vitti and John Phillip Law.\n\nThe \"Cascade\" was decommissioned on 22 November 1974 and struck from the Naval Register on 23 November 1974. She was subsequently sold for scrap to Luria Brother of Brooklyn, New York, and dismantled at the Gulmar Yard in Brownsville, Texas starting September 1975. The anchor, along with mooring cleats at the front entrance of the school, ended up at Danville High School in Danville, KY. The anchor has become a symbol of stability and security to all Danville Admirals. It keeps school spirit from drifting and stands as a constant reminder of Admiral tradition. The anchor has been on loan from the Navy to DHS since it was placed. \n\n\"Cascade\" received one battle star for World War II service.\n\n\n\n"}

After completing primary school, he attended the Chrzanowski Gymnasium, where on 2 July 1914 he joined the secret \"Tadeusz Reytan Scout Chapter\" (also known as \"2 WDH\"); soon he went on his first scout camp.\n\nIn the summer of 1915, the town of Warsaw was evacuated. Skorupka and his family left to Russia, to the town of Klińce, near Homel. There he joined a Scouting unit secretly organised by Polish evacuees. Between 1916 and 1917, he took part in two Scout camps. In 1918, Kazimierz returned to Poland alone. He then studied at the Konarski Technical School, where he joined \"10 WDH\" and achieved the rank of \"Scout\" (wywiadowca).\n\nIn August 1920, Skorupka was mobilised. In December of that year, he founded the \"1st Kamionkowska Scouting Chapter\" in Grochów, which was joined by a platoon from \"32 WDH\", under the command of Janek Makowski. On 6 May 1921, the group was assigned the number \"22\" (which is the traditional number of the first Scouting Chapter in Grochów, founded in 1915 by Stefan Mikołajewski), as well as the patron Wladislaus the Short. Skorupka remained with \"22 WDH\" for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1938 he was awarded the \"Silver Cross of Merit\" (Srebrny Krzyż Zasługi), for social work carried out under the Scouts. When the war broke out in 1939, he organised the Scouts from Praga (a quarter of Warsaw) for service on the \"Scout War Medical Services\" (Pogotowie Wojenne Harcerzy), also directing the \"Scout Communication Services\" (harcerska służba łączności). For his part in the defence of Warsaw, he was awarded the \"Cross of Bravery\" (Krzyż Walecznych). From the start of the occupation, Skorupka was the \"spiritual leader\", so to say, of the \"Cospiratory Scouts\" (konspiracyjne harcerstwo), the Szare Szeregi (Grey Ranks) from Praga. He proceeded to adopt his prewar nickname - Dziad (\"Old man\") - as his codename.\n\nSkorupka then became completely absorbed with the resistance work, and he became the communications liaison to the commander of the \"Home Army’s\" Praga division. His ordinary job as a tram driver helped to cover his organisational work.\n\nWhen asked by Stanisław \"Orsza\" Broniewski (successor of Naczelnik Szarych Szeregów) about how many Scouts there were in Praga, Skorupka replied that there were 3,000. When asked on what basis he arrived at that figure, he replied: \"All I have to do is whistle and 3,000 boys will assemble themselves on the corner of Targowa and Zamoyskiego St. That is how many were in the Praga Chapter on 1 September 1939, nothing has changed here!\". In reality, the actual number was far smaller.\n\nOn 17 August 1942, Skorupka was arrested by the Gestapo, having managed to inform those closest to him that the Nazis knew about his conspiratory activities. He nonetheless resisted the Gestapo’s interrogation, and did not reveal the names of his co-conspirators. In early 1943, Skorupa was taken to a concentration camp in Majdanek. One of the last traces he left were documents confirming his arrival at the camp - which are currently found in the concentration camp's museum - on a list of prisoners kept by the camp’s resistance section. On this list, he is noted under number 273: \"Kazimierz Skorupka, born 18 February 1908, son of Adam and Elenor\". The second trace of the last days of Kazimierz Skorupka are the testimonies of former prisoners who describe someone whose profile fits that of Skorupka. He was classified as a political prisoner and was often taken for interrogation. He would be taken in the mornings and return in the evenings, having been beaten, his health degrading progressively. One evening, he did not return to the prisoners’ barracks.\n\nIn August, 1944 Kazimierz Skorupka posthumously received a second \"Cross of Bravery\" (Krzyż Walecznych), being promoted to \"Second Lieutenant\".\n"}
{"id": "2232610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232610", "title": "Predicament escape", "text": "Predicament escape\n\nA predicament escape is any form of magic trick or escapology stunt in which the performer is trapped in an apparently dangerous situation and is required to escape from it. Classic examples include the Table of Death, Houdini's Chinese Water Torture Cell, Princess Tenko's escape from an exploding boat and the Upside Down Suspended Straitjacket escape, in which a performer is suspended high in the air from a burning rope. \n\nWhile many such feats are pure and simple escape acts performed for real, the predicament escape is also employed as a set-up or theme for certain illusions. These can end either with the performer emerging from the escape prop or appearing magically at another point in the performance space. Examples include a trick in which Melinda Saxe escaped from a tank filled with snakes during the 1998 television special \"The World's Most Dangerous Magic\" and a performance in the sequel show the following year in which the magician Margo was shackled in a coffin filled with rats and escaped to re-appear from behind the audience.\n\nWhen performed by a female artist, these types of stunts sometimes involve aspects of the damsel in distress archetype, although with the damsel rescuing herself rather than waiting for a hero to come to her aid.\n\nOne sub-variant, sometimes known as \"escape gone wrong\" tricks, are presented initially as escape acts but then appear to go wrong, giving the audience the impression the performer must have been killed or badly injured. The artist uses illusion techniques to re-appear unharmed. The Table of Death is sometimes classified in this way. Another example is a stunt performed by Paul Daniels in which he was placed in a crate in the path of a race car, later emerging as the driver of the car after it had smashed through the crate. The Drill of Death illusion can also be presented as an \"escape gone wrong\".\n\nAnother variant on the \"escape gone wrong\" illusion ends without the performer re-appearing. Such a trick was performed by Paul Daniels on the halloween edition of his BBC television show in 1987. He was chained up in an iron maiden type device where a set of spikes were set to close on him after a timer ran out. The broadcast showed the spikes closing on him before he had appeared and then the titles rolled. It was only revealed later that he was alright and the intended effect of the trick had been to shock viewers.\n\nThe cabinet escape is the classic escapology trick, where the magician is trapped in a cabinet and required to escape from it. Often, the magician can be bound in handcuffs, rope and sacks before being placed in the cabinet. A cabinet escape involves the audience seeing the person come out of the cabinet unassisted.\n"}

It is part of the Cambridge Academic Partnership, along with Parkside Sixth, Coleridge Community College, Trumpington Community College, and Cambridge Academy for Science and Technology (formerly UTC Cambridge). Cambridge Academic Partnership joined the United Learning group of academies as a unit in September 2019.\n\nThe college has two specialisms in arts and languages. The College is situated in the centre of the city, north of Parker's Piece. Parkside was the first school to be designated a specialist media arts college in 1997, under the UK government's specialist schools programme. It has developed a second specialism in Modern Foreign Languages. Although called a 'community college', it is neither a community school nor a college but had foundation status since 2003 and became an academy in 2011.\n\nIt is situated east of the A603 and next to the main Cambridge Parkside police station and the National Express coach stops. It is east of Emmanuel College, Cambridge.\n\nThe school was first opened as a higher grade school in Melbourne Place in 1913, providing places for about 820 boys and girls; fees between 6\"d\" and 9\"d\" a week were charged. Following the Education Act 1918, it became a central school.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1974 it was the \"Cambridge Grammar School for Girls\", after which it became the co-educational comprehensive Parkside Community College. It was the first school in the UK to be designated a Media Arts College under the UK government's specialist schools programme, in 1997, and was granted Foundation status in 2003.\n\nIn 2005 Parkside Community College formed the Parkside Federation with Coleridge Community College, which had then been placed in special measures. The school achieved Academy status in 2011 when the federation converted to a multiacademy trust. At the same time it opened a new sixth-form college, Parkside Sixth. In 2017 the trust changed its name to the Cambridge Academic Partnership.\n\nThe history of the school is related in \"An Epoch-Making School\", by former Deputy Principal Rosemary Gardiner (1983).\n\nIts work as a specialist media arts college has been documented in a number of research studies by staff at the school. These include studies of an extensive primary school animation project (e.g. Burn and Parker, 2001), run in conjunction with the Cambridge Film Consortium, a group composed of Anglia Ruskin University, City Screen (an Arts cinema chain), the Cambridge Film Festival, and Parkside itself.\n\nA comprehensive account of the school's media work, giving examples of work in digital video, computer games, animation, and television drama, as well as work across the curriculum, is provided in Andrew Burn and James Durran's \"Media Literacy in Schools\" (2007).\n\nOn 1 December 2008, the Nova 9 helium balloon took two space-suited teddies close to the edge of space from the grounds of Churchill College, Cambridge. The space suits were designed by 11–13-year olds at the school. The journey took just over two hours. The teddies descended back to Earth and landed near Ipswich, being located by GPS equipment.\n\nParkside Community College achieves GCSE results that are consistently among the best for state schools in Cambridgeshire.\n\n\nThe author Nick Hornby was an English teacher at the school between 1982 and 1984.\n\nThe UCL English professor and media theorist Andrew Burn (professor) taught English, Media and Drama at the school from 1986 to 2001.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lin Li started gymnastics when she entered elementary school in 1993. By 2002, Lin Li was selected for the National Team. Since joining the national team, Lin has competed at many prestigious championships such as the 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, 2004 Olympics and 2004 World Cup Final.\n\nLin Li is the 2003 National Champion on the uneven bars as well as a two time national bronze medalist on floor exercise.\n\nLin Li was chosen for the 2004 Olympics because the coaches felt certain that Lin could bring home an individual medal on the uneven bars. After the preliminary rounds Lin was second on the uneven bars. She outscored both Li Ya and Fan Ye by earning a 9.7.\n\nLin also earned the highest score on the uneven bars during the Team Finals. Unfortunately, Lin felt a lot of pressure in medaling on the uneven bars after the Chinese WAG and MAG teams failed to medal during the team competition. With the added pressure on top of the usual nerves, Lin watered down her routine and failed to medal during the uneven bars final.\n\nAfter the Olympics, Lin was not chosen for any Grand Prix events, but competed at the 2004 World Cup Final on the uneven bars and finished 6th.\n\nAfter a disappointing year in 2004, Lin also failed to win any medals at the 2005 Chinese National Championships. Many critics felt that Lin Li's career was over. Some even went as far as saying she would \"never\" compete internationally again. Lin Li proved her critics wrong and was last seen competing at the 2005 Australia VS China Dual Meet. She finished 5th in the all around and 1st on the uneven bars. \n\nUnfortunately, she fractured her hand during warm-ups on the uneven bars at the dual meet. She continued to train on the other three events.

The lineup began taking shape in 2001, with drummer Eric Edman and keyboardist Bebban Stenborg climbing aboard shortly thereafter. Shout Out Louds wasted little time writing songs, the first three of which formed the basis of their first demo tape. The music caught the ear of Filip Wilén, owner of Sweden's Bud Fox Recordings, and he quickly signed the group to his label. Shout Out Louds then spent the majority of 2002 writing more songs, and December found them recording their debut EP, 100°, which was released in 2003. The group's high-energy, ultra-melodic sound was in place from the very beginning.\n\nThe band toured Sweden and Scandinavia in support of 100°, whose release was followed by two singles, \"Hurry Up Let's Go\" and \"Shut Your Eyes.\" In October 2003, the group released its first album, Howl Howl Gaff Gaff, to great acclaim in Sweden. The band spent the following year touring, releasing additional material (\"Please Please Please,\" \"Very Loud/Wish I Was Dead,\" and the Oh, Sweetheart EP), and inking an American deal with Capitol Records. The U.S. version of Howl Howl Gaff Gaff was released in May 2005, featuring songs from the Swedish release plus some early singles and EP tracks. A tour of the U.S. with indie darlings the Dears helped boost the band's profile, as did airplay on The O.C. Despite such growing success, the band's 2007 album \"Our Ill Wills\" produced by Björn Yttling was a somber, melancholy affair, replete with icy synths and Cure-inspired vocals. Another round of tour dates kept the bandmates busy until mid-2008, at which point they decided to take a half-year hiatus. March 2009 found the musicians reconvening in Stockholm to write new material, and by August the band had decamped to Seattle to begin recording with producer Phil Ek. Their third album, Work, arrived in early 2010. After coming home from a tour to support the album, the band members felt that a change in the way they worked was in order. Hoping to recapture the more relaxed spirit of earlier recordings, they spent time outside the studio composing the songs, with each band member responsible for coming up with their own parts. When they came back together, the band produced their next record themselves (with help from Johannes Berglund) in a small Stockholm studio. Optica was released by Merge in early 2013. The next few years saw a handful of solo releases from both Olenius and from Stenborg's Astropol project. Regrouping in Stockholm, the Shout Out Louds returned with 2017's more guitar-oriented Ease My Mind. \n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in 1994 for PCs operating DOS, with subsequent Macintosh and Microsoft Windows releases in 1995 and 1996. It was one of the first games to bring the side-scrolling platformer style—common on gaming consoles—to a PC audience. On November 30, 2017 the game was re-released on GOG.com along with \"Jazz Jackrabbit 2\", with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nThe game is set in a fantasy world based on Aesop's \"The Tortoise and the Hare\", in which the enmity between tortoises and hares continues even after three thousand years. An evil mastermind tortoise named Devan Shell begins conquering planets, suppressing any native confrontation. One of such planets, Carrotus, is home to a peaceful hare kingdom that, once confronted by Shell, is able to provide enough resistance to fend him off. Enraged by his loss, Devan decides to kidnap Carrotus princess Eva Earlong and hide her on a distant airbase of unknown location to weaken the hares. In response, the king chooses to send Carrotus' hero Jazz Jackrabbit, who carries a blue LFG-2000 gun, to various planets conquered by Devan that might contain clues to the location of Eva's imprisonment. As Jazz travels through different worlds, he gains new weapons and meets new enemies in his pursuit to rescue the princess and save Carrotus from Devan Shell and his army of Turtle Terrorists.\n\nJazz is depicted as a bright green jackrabbit with a red bandana, bracers and a blue \"blaster\" gun.\n\nThe game is divided into six episodes. Each episode has three planets (worlds), with every planet itself consisting of two levels (some planets have an additional secret level). The final level of every episode features a boss that the player must deal with in order to complete the level. Episodes are tied by a single storyline usually progressing after each episode is finished.\n\nGameplay mechanics in \"Jazz\" are very similar to \"Zool\"'s, with the exception of not being able to destroy the enemies by simply jumping at them (which was not added until the second game). Jazz will run faster and jump higher the longer he runs, avoiding chasms that might lead to harmful objects. Unlike other platform games, however, there are no abysses and every level bifurcates into subsections that might lead to valuable items (such as weapon pick-ups, score items, etc.) while the direction of general progression is hinted at with occasional arrows. Jazz has a life bar that changes in colour based on how much health Jazz has remaining. Jazz can withstand a limited number of hits (5 on Easy mode, 4 on Medium mode, 3 on Hard or Turbo mode) from harmful objects before losing a life; one hit's worth of health can be restored by picking up a carrot. Lives can also be accumulated to the maximum number of ten. When killed, Jazz starts from the level beginning or at any checkpoint sign that had been reached and shot before.\n\nItems that the player can pick up usually resemble food, computer hardware components or other familiar shapes, and give 100 score points each. There are also several beneficial pick-ups in the game: a \"force shield\" that protects Jazz from one or four hits, a sidekick in form of a bird that shoots enemies, a hoverboard that allows flight, rapid fire/super jump bonuses, a temporary \"speed-up\" and invincibility, as well as extra lives. Weapons also vary in numbers and consistency and include (besides the initial blaster) bouncing launcher grenades, flame bullets, bi-missile projectiles and TNT sets. Large sets of ammunition can only be collected by being shot from their enclosure.\n\nThe first game features a timer that starts a number of minutes at the beginning of each level (9 minutes 59 seconds on Easy mode, 8 minutes on Medium, 6 minutes on Hard, and 4 minutes on Turbo) and counts down to zero; on Hard and Turbo, another countdown appears at the top of the screen when there is less than a minute left, and if time expires, Jazz loses a life. If Jazz reaches and shoots the finish sign before time runs out, the player is then provided with additional score points awarded for the remaining time and a perfect score if he picks up all items and/or deals with all enemies. If Jazz finishes the area with a big red diamond, he gets to enter the bonus stage. In these stages, animation switches to a pseudo-3D (third-person shooter) of Jazz as he runs on a speedway with the purpose of gathering as many blue diamonds as requested before time runs out, while obstacles try to stop him or slow him down. If the task is accomplished successfully, the player is provided with an extra life.\n\nAside from bonuses, \"Jazz\" also features secret levels that can be accessed in specific areas of other levels once in every episode. Secret level signs feature the question mark instead of Devan's head portrait that must be shot. The current level is then considered completed and the secret level embarks. Levels themselves consist of an enormous \"grant\" area with numerous weapons and items to pick up. One level, however, features a mini-boss, while the player assumes control of Jazz in his sidekick bird form. Secret levels also feature a count-up upon completion that provides the player with extra score points.\n\n\"Jazz Jackrabbit\" was coded by Arjan Brussee and designed by Cliff Bleszinski for Epic MegaGames. It was greatly inspired by the Amiga game \"Zool\" and the ongoing success of video game classics (such as \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" and \"Mega Man\") defining the platform game genre in the 1990s market, and was initially considered to be a pastiche of Sega's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" in the computer world. The game did not manage to reach the popularity of \"Sonic\", but did acquire a sizable audience due to its fast-paced gameplay and advanced graphics. The game's audio was implemented using an interactive music system called \"Cybersound Music System\".\n\nOn November 28, 1994, a CD-ROM version was released under the title \"Jazz Jackrabbit CD\", containing all six original episodes, as well as 3 additional ones known as \"The Lost Episodes\" listed as episodes A, B, and C. In episode C, there is a secret level with Jazz in the form of a lizard. A shareware Christmas edition was released on December 15, 1994, with a special 3-level holiday-themed episode, titled \"Holiday Hare\". Subsequent pressings of the CD-ROM edition added Holiday Hare as episode X, bringing the total episode count to 10. Furthermore, on November 17, 1995, another shareware Christmas edition was released with a different holiday episode, titled \"Holiday Hare '95\", with 2 new holiday-themed worlds.\n\nA sequel named \"Jazz Jackrabbit 2\" was released in 1998, as well as a reboot on Game Boy Advance in 2002. The commercial success of the game kickstarted the career of its co-creator, Cliff Bleszinski, who would later be a key force behind Epic Games' \"Unreal\" and \"Gears of War\". The engine of the pseudo-3D stages was reused for the racing game \"2 Fast 4 You\", an advertorial game for BiFi that was released in 1996 for DOS.\n\n"}
{"id": "2232700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232700", "title": "Elizabeth Billington", "text": "Elizabeth Billington\n\nElizabeth Billington (1765 or 1768, in London25 August 1818, in Venice) was a British opera singer.\n\nShe was probably born about 1768 in Litchfield Street, Soho, London. She was the daughter of Carl Weichsel, a native of Freiberg, in Saxony, principal oboist at the King's Theatre. Her mother, Frederika, née Weirman, an English vocalist of some distinction, was a pupil of Johann Christian Bach, and sang at Vauxhall with success between 1765 and 1775.\n\nElizabeth Weichsel received her earliest musical instruction, in company with her brother Charles (who afterwards was known as a violinist) from her father, under whom she studied the pianoforte with such assiduity that on 10 March 1774 she played at a concert at the Haymarket for her mother's benefit. In addition to her father's instruction she studied under Johann Samuel Schroeter, and before she was twelve years old published two sets of pianoforte sonatas. She now began to turn her attention to the cultivation of her voice, and at the early age of fourteen appeared at a public concert in Oxford.\n\nOn 13 October 1783 she was married under her mother's maiden name, Wierman, at Lambeth Church to James Billington, a double-bass player in the Drury Lane orchestra, from whom she had had lessons in singing. Immediately after their marriage the Billingtons went to Dublin, where she made her first appearance on the stage in the part of Eurydice. After singing at Waterford and other towns in Ireland she returned to London in 1786, and was offered an engagement at Covent Garden for three nights only, but she insisted on being engaged for twelve nights, at a salary of £12 a week. On these terms she was announced to appear on 14 Feb. 1786, but the renown she had already won in Dublin had preceded her, and 'by command of their majesties' she appeared on the 13th as Rosetta in Thomas Arne's \"Love in a Village.\" At the end of the twelve nights she was engaged for the rest of the season at a salary of £1,000.\n\nA contemporary account of her at this period says that her voice was of great sweetness, compass, and power, and that she possessed 'a great deal of genuine beauty and very unaffected and charming manners;' but the secret of her great success was the unremitting zeal with which she studied her art. Her brother-in-law, Thomas Billington, says that she had originally 'a very indifferent voice and manner,' which she completely changed by the industry with which, throughout her public career, she pursued her studies. At the end of her first season she went to Paris, and had lessons from the Antonio Sacchini, whose last pupil she was, and at different periods of her career she also studied with Morelli, Ferdinando Paer, and Friedrich Heinrich Himmel. She returned to London for the season of 1786-7, and continued to sing there, at Covent Garden, the Concerts of Ancient Music, the so-called Oratorios, and the Handel Commemorations, until the end of 1793. William Shield wrote his operas of 'Marian' and 'The Prophet' for her, and in 1789 she appeared as Yarico in Dr. Arnold's long-popular compilation, 'Inkle and Yarico.' Others of her favourite parts were Mandane (in 'Artaxerxes'), and the heroines in 'Polly,' the 'Duenna,' the 'Castle of Andalusia,' 'Corali,' 'Clara,' the 'Flitch of Bacon'.\n\nMrs. Billington was not happy in her marriage, and even before she had appeared on the London stage rumour had been busy with her fair fame. In 1792 there appeared an anonymous publication, which professed to contain her private correspondence with her mother. This work was of so disgraceful and scurrilous a description that Mrs. Billington was forced to take legal proceedings against the publishers. An answer to the 'Memoirs' appeared in due course ; but it seems probable that the scandal induced Mrs. Billington to abandon her profession and retire to the Continent. Accompanied by her brother and her husband, she left England early in 1794, and travelled by way of Germany to Italy. At Naples she was induced by Sir William Hamilton, the English ambassador, to sing in private before the royal family. This led to her singing at the San Carlo, where she appeared in a new opera, 'Inez di Castro,' written expressly for her by Francesco Bianchi, on 30 May 1794. Her singing created an extraordinary impression, but her triumph was cut short by the sudden death of her husband, which took place the day after her first appearance, as he was preparing to accompany his wife to the theatre, after dining with the Bishop of Winchester. She stayed at Naples sixteen months, and then sang at Florence, Leghorn, Milan, Venice, and Trieste. In 1797, when singing at Venice, she was prostrated with a severe illness for six weeks. On her recovery the opera house was illuminated for three nights. \n\nAt Milan she was received with much favour by the Joséphine de Beauharnais, and here she met a young Frenchman, M. Felissent, to whom she was married in 1799. After her second marriage she went to live at St. Artien, an estate she had bought between Venice and Treviso; but her life was rendered so insupportable by the ill-treatment she received from her husband that in 1801 she left him and returned to England. Felissent, who, it was said, had been publicly flogged as an impostor at Milan, followed her to London, but he was arrested and expelled the country as an alien.\n\nMrs. Billington's return to London caused a great stir in the musical world, and the managers both of Covent Garden (Harris) and Drury Lane (Richard Brinsley Sheridan) were eager to secure her services. After some negotiation it was arranged that she should appear alternately at both houses, the terms she was to receive being 3,000 guineas for the season, together with a benefit guaranteed to amount to £500, and £500 to her brother for leading the orchestra on the nights she appeared. Her reappearance took place at Covent Garden on 3 Oct. 1801, in Thomas Arne's \"Artaxerxes,\" in which she sang the part of Mandane, Incledon singing that of Arbaces. During 1801 she made from £10,000 to £15,000, and at one time her fortune is said to have amounted to £65,000. In 1802 Mrs. Billington appeared in Italian opera at the King's Theatre, on the occasion of the farewell of Banti, when both these great artists sang in Sebastiano Nasolini's 'Merope.' A similar performance took place on 3 June of the same year, when she was induced to sing a duet with Mara, at the farewell concert of her great rival. From this time until her retirement in 1811 she continued to sing in Italian opera. Winter wrote his 'Calypso' (1803) expressly for her, and in 1806 she distinguished herself by producing, for her benefit, \"La Clemenza di Tito,\" the first opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart performed in this country. During 1809-10 she suffered much from ill-health, and at length she retired from the profession, her last appearance being announced at her brother's benefit concert on 3 May 1811. She appeared, however, once more at Whitehall Chapel in 1814, at a concert in aid of the sufferers by the German war. After her retirement she lived in princely style at a villa at Fulham. In 1817 she was reconciled to her husband, and went with him to live near Venice, where she died on 25 August 1818.\n\nHer child by her first husband had died in infancy ; but it was believed that an adopted child, whom she had placed in a convent at Brussels, was her own daughter.\n\nContemporary opinions as to the merits of Mrs. Billington as a singer differ to a singular degree. It was always her misfortune to be forced into a position of rivalry with some other great artist, and thus partisanship often guided the judgments of her critics. As to the perfect finish of her singing all are agreed. The Earl of Mount Edgcombe says that her voice was sweet and flexible, her execution neat and precise, her embellishments in good taste and judicious, but that she lacked feeling, and was no actress. Miss Seward writes of her : 'She has too much sense to gambol like Mara in the sacred songs;' but George III, who was no mean judge—by suggesting in a written memorandum, that Lord Carmarthen 'if he can get her to sing pathetick songs, and not to over-grace them, will be doing an essential service to the court'—seems to imply that she had the great fault of the singers of that day, viz. the excessive and indiscriminate use of vocal embellishments. She was all through her life a finished pianist. Salomon used to say that 'she sang with her fingers,' and quite late in life she played a duet in public with J. B. Cramer. \n\nIn person Mrs. Billington was very handsome, though inclined to stoutness. Her portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds as Saint Cecilia, and has been engraved by James Ward, Pastorini, and Cardon.\nThe exhibition of old masters at Burlington House in 1885 contained a small portrait by Reynolds, said to be of Mrs. Billington in her youth, a statement which is probably inaccurate. Two miniatures of her were painted, one by Daniel, and there are engravings of her by T. Burke after De Koster, as Mandane by Heath after Stothard, by Bartolozzi after Cosway, by Dunkarton after Downman, and by Assen. A portrait of Clara in the 'Duenna,' painted and engraved by J. R. Smith in 1797, probably represents Mrs. Billington.\nHaydn said of her, that Sir Joshua Reynolds should rather have painted the angels listening to Mrs Billington singing, than have depicted, as he did, Mrs Billington listening to the angels.\n\nAttribution:\n"}

{"id": "2232719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232719", "title": "LeVeque Tower", "text": "LeVeque Tower\n\nThe LeVeque Tower is a 47-story skyscraper located at 50 West Broad Street in Columbus, Ohio. At it was the tallest building in the city from its completion in 1927 to 1974, and remains the second-tallest today.\n\nDesigned by C. Howard Crane, the art moderne skyscraper was opened as the American Insurance Union Citadel in 1927 and at the time was the fifth tallest building in the world. Built at a cost of $8.7 million, the tower's design incorporated ornate ornamentation and a terracotta facade, and it was designed with 600 hotel rooms in two wings as well as an attached performance venue, the Palace Theatre. After American Insurance Union went bankrupt in the Great Depression, the tower was renamed the Lincoln-LeVeque Tower in 1946, and later the LeVeque Tower in 1977.\n\nThe tower's office space saw mixed success in attracting tenants during its early history, but it became home to a number of state agencies and law firms. As development of downtown Columbus peaked from the 1960s and several other high rise buildings were constructed, the tower faced increasing competition from other major office buildings and its vacancy rates rose. Over the course of its history, the tower changed hands several times before being sold to a group of real estate investors in 2011. The current owners subsequently converted it into a mixed-use development including a hotel, apartments, condominiums, offices and a restaurant, which opened in 2017.\n\nWhat would become the LeVeque Tower was commissioned by the American Insurance Union, a group formed in 1894 as a \"fraternal insurance company, secret society and social club\" by John J. Lentz, who would later become a U.S. Representative, and who served as president of the organization. Originally named the \"American Insurance Union Citadel,\" the tower was to be the headquarters for the organization and would replace a smaller building it used on the corner of Broad Street and Front Street in downtown Columbus, a short distance from the Scioto River. The tower was designed by Detroit, Michigan-based architect C. Howard Crane, known for grandiose designs. Its construction took place during the first wave of modern skyscraper development in the United States.\n\nThe original plan for the tower was to have three principal components: a 47-story tower with a rentable area of , which would be flanked by a pair of 18-story wings; the 2,827-seat Keith-Albee Theater (later renamed Palace Theatre;) and the 600-room Deshler-Wallick Hotel. It was to measure along both Broad and Front streets and rise to in height. This intentionally set the building taller than the Washington Monument.\n\nDesigned in the art moderne style, the building took inspiration from Byzantine architecture, particularly religious buildings constructed in the 4th through 13th centuries. Initially, Crane considered stone to construct the building but later decided on cream-colored terracotta despite concerns its blocks would be small and prone to warping. It featured a large number of figures situated and higher along the building facade and around its pinnacle, including eagles with wingspans up to , giants and angels up to . Some of these were later removed after concerns about falling materials and to obtain unobstructed penthouse views. An octagonal bartizan was designed at the top of the building with long, narrow loop windows, and it was topped by a dome with heraldic imagery. Inside, the building contained marble imported from Italy and Belgium, and public spaces were decorated with bronze and mosaics. The building lobby was designed with a marble floor with a bronze plaque containing the building's horoscope and which shows the positions of the planets at the time that the building's cornerstone was laid. Following completion, the building was lit at night to accentuate its architectural features, and its four turrets were also lit with floodlights to make a landmark for aviators, which at times made it visible for up to as a navigational aide. The top of the tower was also designed to accommodate mooring for zeppelins. Later, it housed radio antennae.\n\nElevators serving the building were \"micro self-leveling type,\" automatically controlled by push buttons and which could travel at per minute, which rose to the 41st floor. A shuttle elevator ran from there to the observation deck. Water tanks for fire protection and plumbing were placed on the 23rd and 43rd floors, and the building was also designed with duplicate mechanical systems for redundancy. An executive dining room, termed the Mid-Air Club, would be built on the 43rd floor, sponsored by local businessmen and aviation enthusiasts. The 44th floor would be an observation deck that would be open to the public for 25 cents. The floor featured 24 floor-to-ceiling windows as well as an observation balcony on the 46th floor, which would be reachable only by ladder. In all, 60 construction contractor companies were named to build the structure, which cost a total of $7.8 million. Northwestern Terra Cotta Co. of Chicago supplied the materials wrapping the building. The American Insurance Union had a five-story auditorium building at 50 W. Broad St. which was torn down in preparation for the new tower. Colonial Theatre, opened at 1909 at 40 W. Broad St., was also closed and demolished in 1924 to make way for the tower.\n\nAt height of construction, about 650 men would work on the structure at a time. Groundbreaking for the tower took place on September 23, 1924. Excavation commenced after that, with 44 caissons sunk into the bedrock for a foundation, through of water using air pressure. These tunnels were so deep that specialized crews of \"sandhogs\", who had gained experience building the Holland Tunnel in New York City, were brought in and the construction site had an on-site hospital and decompression chamber for men suffering from decompression sickness. On January 26, 1925, an accident occurred underground that killed four workers when a toxic gas was accidentally released during the setting of the caissons, overwhelming them and causing them to fall into the foundation. A fifth construction worker was killed later in the buildings construction after falling from its steel framing. A cornerstone was laid on February 13, 1926. The building's frame would consist of of steel. The building was wired with of electrical wire, of heating pipe for thousands of radiators, 67 electrical motors, 14,000 electrical outlets, and 1,756 windows. Construction of the building took 19 months. It was dedicated on September 21, 1927. When complete, it was the tallest building in Columbus and the fifth tallest building in the world, including being the tallest building between New York City and Chicago. Albert Bushnell Hart, who spoke at the building's dedication, likened the building to Carcassonne.\n\nArt and architecture critics received the tower's design well. Dudley Crafts Watson, director of Chicago Art Institute, highlighted it as one of five great examples of artistic achievement to come out of Columbus in the 1920s, calling it \"the most original and American of skyscrapers\" and \"just an honest piece of magnificent construction.\" Writing in 1932 in a book \"Ohio Art and Artists\", Edna Clarke called the building \"a milestone in the growth of the city ... it signalizes the transformation from a large overgrown country town into a city. It stands out against the skyline so sharply it can't be ignored.\" \"Architectural Forum\" called it \"splendid\" and \"impressive.\" The tower quickly became a symbol synonymous with Columbus and one of the city's most well-recognized landmarks. It was the first landmark that was easily visible from around the city.\n\nThe building's construction coincided with a rebuilding of the Columbus riverfront along the Scioto River following the Great Flood of 1913. In the 1920s and 1930s, the city saw a new Columbus City Hall built across the street, a new headquarters for the Columbus Police Department, a new federal building, courthouse and state office building. The city's population tripled by 1950 to 375,000 people.\n\nFloodlights were first installed on the LeVeque Tower in 1989, illuminating its top floors with white light during evenings and nighttime. Later, the owners had theatrical gels installed to add colored lights as an option. During the building's 2012-17 restoration, the floodlights were replaced with computer-controlled LED lights to save on energy usage and allow for a wider array of color options. The new lights, ranging from 6-inch lights to 3-square-foot arrays, allow for 256 million color combinations. The building is now lit for events about six to eight times per year, including pink for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure breast cancer organization in April and May, rainbow colors during the Columbus Pride weekend in June, red, white, and blue for the Fourth of July, purple for Purple Heart recognition in August, teal for ovarian cancer awareness in September, and red and green during the Christmas and holiday season.\n\nAfter the tower's completion, American Insurance Union occupied floors 19 and 20, with the remainder of the space available for rental out to other office users. But the construction of the building saw several significant cost overruns, prompting American Insurance Union to dip into its financial reserves to pay for the tower. Financial problems soon arose for the insurer, because the tower cost $800,000 more than its budget allowed for, and not all of the office space planned in the building filled up quickly.\n\nThe tower immediately became important to radio broadcasting in the city, which was in the late 1920s becoming more important. This was because the building was an ideal height for broadcasting and there were no mountains or other intervening structures around Central Ohio to disrupt radio signals broadcast from antennae at the tower's apex. The tower then became home to a number of radio stations, including WAIU. Lentz had purchased WAIU in 1925 to serve as a platform for his progressive views. Moving into the tower allowed WAIU to increase its broadcasting power to 5,000 watts. By the 1960s, WCOL had a broadcast room atop the tower.\n\nAmerican Insurance Union failed during the Great Depression, and was reorganized as the American Insurance Union Inc. in 1931. The entity survived until 1934 when it went into receivership, and ceased to exist. During this time, the tower was known pejoratively as the \"IOU Tower\" given the financial difficulties of its owner. After the company went bankrupt, the group marketed the building in order to pay off unpaid policies. It ultimately sold to Lesley LeVeque and John Lincoln in 1945 and was renamed the LeVeque-Lincoln Tower. LeVeque was a local real estate investor, and after his death, his son Fred LeVeque and his wife, Katherine LeVeque, became prominent figures in the Columbus community.\n\nThe tower dominated the Columbus skyline, which did not see significant high-rise construction until the 1960s, though there was at least one major attempt to build another high-rise in the city in 1953. It was the only building in Columbus taller than until 1962. As a number of other major commercial ventures like Huntington Bank and American Electric Power flourished in the city, its urban core saw construction of new high rises to suit them. The building remained the tallest structure in Columbus until the Rhodes State Office Tower was completed in 1974. The Lincoln-LeVeque Tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Fred LeVeque bought the Palace Theatre but was killed in an airplane crash in 1975, leaving Katherine LeVeque president of the company's prominent Columbus real estate group, LeVeque Enterprises. Columbus' downtown office market saw some issues with high vacancy rates, but the tower itself retained higher-than-average occupancy rates.\n\nKatherine LeVeque took complete control of the building through a trust in 1977. That year, the name was officially changed to the LeVeque Tower. It faced increasing competition from other office buildings being constructed in downtown Columbus in the 1980s, and LeVeque put $18 million into renovations to keep the historic tower competitive with newer and more modern office space, including a totally new HVAC system, energy efficiency upgrades and updates to the bathrooms and public areas of the building. In 1984, the opening of Huntington Center, Capitol Square and One Columbus Center put of new office space on the market in downtown Columbus.\n\nThe State of Ohio was a major tenant in the building for a significant part of its history. The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services leased nearly 20 percent of the building until it moved in 2003, and the Ohio Department of Aging was a major tenant as well. Additionally, a number of law firms and private financial services entities leased space in the building. The loss of the major state organizations in the tower significantly hurt the building's ability to pay for its mortgage, and in 2004, an affiliate of Miami-based LNR Property Corp. took control of the tower, which was then valued at $22 million. LeVeque turned the building over to the new ownership group in lieu of a foreclosure on a $16.2 million mortgage on the building, and at this point it was about a third empty. She had previously engaged an architect on a proposal to convert part of the building to residential use, but it was deemed not financially feasible at the time.\n\nIn 2005, the building was sold again to Finsilver/Friedman Management Corp. for $8.5 million. At the time of the sale, the building remained about a third empty. The new building owner committed to substantial upgrades to the tower to keep it competitive. The renovations helped it land some smaller tenants in the office space. Leasing there, though, remained poor and by 2009 its office space was still about a third empty, in spite of the change of leasing teams several times.\n\nIn 2011, the tower was purchased by Tower 10 LLC, a joint venture of Columbus real estate investors including Bob Meyers, Don Casto and Michael Schiff, for $4 million. By that point, the office building's vacancy rate had risen to 43 percent. The partners planned a $22 million project to fix cracked terracotta on the tower and convert it from an office building to a hotel and residential structure. In 2012, the owners announced the renovation would cost $26.7 million, including $5 million in tax credits from the State of Ohio the renovation.\n\nThe renovation project, completed in 2017, saw extensive work to repair the building's terracotta facade and modernize its interior. LeVeque Tower was redesigned as a mixed use development, with floors 5 to 10 of the building converted into a 150-room boutique hotel, the Hotel LeVeque under Marriott International's Autograph Collection brand, and with some event space. Floors 3, 4, and 11-18 were renovated as 160,000 square feet of office space, while the remaining 19 floors were converted into upscale residential units, a mix of 68 apartments and 12 condominiums, with two penthouse units on the top floors. A restaurant, The Keep, was opened by Illinois-based First Hospitality Group Inc. on the second floor.\n\nThe building's two wings were used as an extra 600 rooms for the Deshler Hotel, which had been built at the northwest corner of Broad and High streets. Announced in 1912 and opened in 1916, the hotel already had 400 rooms, intended to rival the other luxury hotels of the world. The hotel was later leased by Lew and Adrian Wallick, hoteliers from Ohio and New York. Called the Deshler-Wallick Hotel by the time the LeVeque tower opened, the 600 rooms were accessible by a \"venetian bridge\" linking the two buildings on the second floor. New York Mayor Jimmy Walker, who attended the opening, tried and nearly succeeded in having a ceremonial sip of wine in each of the 600 hotel rooms. The hotel would later host President Harry S. Truman in 1946 during a meeting of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ. He and Bess Truman would later stay at the hotel again in 1953. In 1947 the hotel sold to Julius Epstein of Chicago, apparently for $2 million, who again sold it five years later to the Hilton Hotels chain, which renamed the hotel the Deshler-Hilton. In 1964 it was sold to a company owned by Charles Cole who renamed it the Deshler-Cole. Cole eliminated the 600 rooms located inside LeVeque Tower and invested $2 million to remodel the hotel. The hotel rooms in the building's wings having been eliminated, the \"venetian bridge\" was demolished. The building was sold a final time to Fred Beasley in 1966 and renamed the Deshler-Beasley before being closed in 1968 and demolished in 1969. Today the site is the home of the One Columbus Center, a tower developed in part by LeVeque Enterprises.\n\nPalace Theatre, at 34 W. Broad St., opened November 8, 1926 as a vaudeville house under the Keith-Albee name. A number of famous performers would appear there, some before their careers took off. Among them were Bing Crosby, George Burns, Gracie Allen, Gypsy Rose Lee, Jack Benny, Tom Mix, Jackie Gleason, The Three Stooges, Eddie Cantor and Mae West, who performed in March 1938 and broke all its previous attendance records. It hosted a number of bands in the 1940s, including Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Guy Lombardo, Benny Goodman and Lionel Hampton. The theatre hosted the world premiere of \"The Male Animal\" on March 12, 1942, which was attended by Henry Fonda, Olivia de Havilland, James Thurber and Joan Leslie.\n\nClosing in 1975, the property fell vacant and was proposed for demolition in order for a parking lot to be constructed. In 1980, the theatre was renovated and restored by Katherine LeVeque using her personal funds, and began hosting a new set of acts. Among these, it brought in Red Skelton, Sammy Davis, Jr., Mickey Rooney, Tom Jones, Natalie Cole, Judy Collins and Tony Bennett. The venue has come to host Broadway theatre acts. Palace Theatre remains in operation with a main 2,827-seat auditorium, designed as a vaudeville house and movie theater. It was acquired by the Columbus Association for the Performing Arts in 1989.\n\nWhile the Leveque Tower was designed by Detoit architect C. Howard Crane, who was noted for designing over 250 theatres across North America, the Palace Theatre within the Leveque Tower was designed by another leading theatre architect, Thomas W. Lamb. Lamb was the preferred architect of the Keith Albee theatre chain.\n\n\n"}

They had minor injuries and five of them have since been discharged. Of the remaining three workers who were hospitalised, one suffered from abdominal and chest injuries, while another suffered a back injury and the last had a finger injury. Seven of the injured are from Bangladesh while the eighth is from China. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has ordered all construction work to stop, while the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has revoked the construction permit for the site while investigations are underway. MOM said that based on preliminary information gathered, workers were pouring concrete, also known as the casting process, into the formwork when the structure supporting the formwork collapsed. The formwork, located between the new and old sections of the station, was part of the structure being built to form the underground linkway, which is about three to four metres deep.

In most production automobiles and motorcycles, which use a wet sump system, the oil is collected in a capacity pan at the base of the engine, known as the sump or oil pan, where it is pumped back up to the bearings by the oil pump, internal to the engine.\n\nA wet sump offers the advantage of a simple design, using a single pump and no external reservoir. Since the sump is internal, there is no need for hoses or tubes connecting the engine to an external sump which may leak. An internal oil pump is generally more difficult to replace, but that is dependent on the engine design.\n\nA wet sump design can be problematic in a racing car, as the large g force pulled by drivers going around corners causes the oil in the pan to slosh, gravitating away from the oil pick-up, briefly starving the system of oil and damaging the engine. However, on a motorcycle this difficulty does not arise, as a bike leans into corners and the oil is not displaced sideways. Nevertheless, racing motorcycles usually benefit from dry sump lubrication, as this allows the engine to be mounted lower in the frame; and a remote oil tank can permit better lubricant cooling. \nEarly stationary engines employed a small scoop on the extremity of the crankshaft or connecting rod to assist with the lubrication of the cylinder walls by means of a splashing action. Modern small engines, such as those used in lawnmowers, use a \"slinger\" (basically a paddle wheel) to perform the same function.\n\nSmall two-stroke engines, as for motorcycles and lawnmowers, use crankcase compression: the fuel mixture passes through the sump space in the crankcase. This precludes the use of both wet sump and dry sump systems, as excess oil here would contaminate the mixture, leading to excess oil being burned in the engine and so excessive hydrocarbon emissions. These engines are instead lubricated by petroil mixtures, where a carefully measured proportion of oil is added to the fuel tank (between 1:16 and 1:50 ratios). This oil is consumed immediately and entirely, so there is no need for a sump to collect and re-use it.\n\nFour-stroke engines, as for almost all cars, and large two-stroke engines used in locomotives and ships can both use either wet or dry sumps. Large two-stroke engines do not use crankcase compression; instead they use a separate blower or supercharger, either a mechanical blower such as a Roots blower or else a turbocharger.\n\n\n"}

It is rectangular in form (approximately 6 meters by 10), with six niches. Today, it lies approximately 12 meters beneath the Stephansplatz.\n\nThe history of the chapel is not entirely clear. The architecture can be dated to the early 13th century. At this time, Frederick the Warlike (1230-1246), the last Duke of the House of Babenberg, was the ruler of Vienna. It has been hypothesized that the Duke, who would have liked to have established Vienna as an episcopal see, had the crypt built for St. Coloman of Stockerau, who was to be the patron of the new diocese. However, the chronicles do not mention the chapel, which has given rise to the speculation that it is the remnant of a failed project.\n\nIn the year 1307, a burial chapel of the Viennese family Chrannest is mentioned. The chapel was said to have multiple altars, one of which was dedicated to St. Vergilius of Salzburg.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Stephansdom was encircled by a large cemetery. A single small chapel, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene (the \"Magdalenskapelle\" or Magdalene Chapel), existed for consecrations and requiem masses. The Virgilius Chapel lay directly underneath this chapel, and a vertical shaft connected the two buildings.\n\nIn 1782, the cemetery around the Stephansdom was closed. The Magdalene Chapel was destroyed by fire in 1781 and was not rebuilt (presumably as, without a cemetery, there was no need for a funeral chapel). The Virgilius Chapel was filled with rubble and faded into obscurity.\n\nIn 1973 the chapel was rediscovered during construction of the Vienna U-Bahn. Today there is a mosaic on the Stephansplatz showing the outlines of the Virgilius Chapel. The chapel itself has survived with hardly any damage and provides the visitor with an excellent glance into the world of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Virgilius Chapel may be entered directly from the Stephansplatz U-Bahn Station. It is possible to look into the chapel from above. A collection of historical ceramics has been installed at the entrance to the chapel itself.\n\n"}

The school was founded in 1968 by professors and assistant-professors from the Catholic University of Leuven. These professors and assistant-professors wanted to use innovative teaching practices that were not commonly used at the time. These practices included using case studies and management games. At that time many professors at top universities lectured without a profound business experience. Since the implementation of the Bachelor and Master classification of academic titles in Europe, the small business school had to associate with a traditional university. In 2007 VLEKHO merged with other Brussels-based Higher Education Institutions to become Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel, the only other university in the KU Leuven Association.\n\nThe Department of Business Economics dates from 1968, when the Flemish School of Higher Education in Economics (Vlekho) was founded in a combined effort on the part of academics, politicians and businessmen to establish a high-quality training programme in business economics in the heart of Brussels. Vlekho's principal objective was clear from the very outset: it wanted to provide business economists with a solid academic formation and a training that would enable them to successfully hold positions of responsibility in business, government service and the social-profit sector.\n\nUpon graduation students are granted the diploma of 'Licentiate in Business Economics' (Post-Bologna process, Master in Business Economics), a degree equivalent to the traditional four-year university degree in economics. Vlekho's study programme in business economics differs from the traditional university programme, however, by its outspoken business-oriented character and its hands-on approach to education, which besides the communication of knowledge strongly emphasizes the development of business attitudes. Each year some seven hundred students are enrolled in the programme.\n\nInternationally, the Department of Business Economics is an active participant in the European Commission's Socrates Programme. To visiting students it offers a programme in International Business in English, a combination of courses and a three-months' internship in an international company in Brussels. In addition, bilateral co-operation agreements have been made with various universities outside the EU.\n\nIn 1983 the Dutch-language section of the Department of Translation and Interpreting of the Institut libre Marie Haps, the oldest and most prestigious school of translation and interpreting in Belgium, was transferred to Vlekho where it became the Department of Applied Linguistics. Each year some seven hundred students are enrolled in this programme. The foreign language courses in the Department are taught in the foreign language, the other degree courses are conducted in Dutch. Here, too, students can participate in a large variety of exchange programmes.\n\nSoon after Vlekho was founded, the need was felt to offer further studies in addition to the four-year degree of 'Licentiate'. The Centre for Graduate Studies offers a programme in basic business economics for young graduates without a formal training in economics. Experienced business people, in turn, are offered an opportunity to deepen their knowledge of company management in advanced courses (Dutch and English). Each year more than six hundred students are enrolled in the courses organized by the Centre.\n\n"}

{"id": "2232764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232764", "title": "Creatures of the Night", "text": "Creatures of the Night\n\nCreatures of the Night is the 10th studio album by American rock band Kiss, released in 1982. It was the band's last for Casablanca Records, the only label for which Kiss had recorded up to that point. The album was dedicated to the memory of Casablanca founder and early Kiss supporter Neil Bogart, who had died of cancer during the recording sessions. It is also the band's last album recorded with Ace Frehley credited as an official member and their first album with Vinnie Vincent as the initially-uncredited lead guitarist (Vincent would later be credited but not featured on the cover of the 1985 reissue of the album). It was also Kiss' last album to feature the band with their trademark makeup until the 1998 release, \"Psycho Circus\".\n\nThe album represented a conscious effort by Kiss to return to the hard rock style that had helped them achieve commercial success with \"Destroyer\" and \"Love Gun\". Their pop-oriented albums \"Dynasty\" and \"Unmasked\" had started a decline in popularity that reached rock bottom with 1981's \"Music from \"The Elder\"\". By 1982, Kiss knew it needed to deliver on their earlier 1980–81 promise of a heavy record.\n\nThe first key ingredient was songwriter/guitarist Vinnie Vincent, who was soon to replace Ace Frehley as the band's new lead guitarist after being introduced to the band by album co-writer Adam Mitchell. Though Frehley did not play on the album, his face was still featured on the album cover for contractual and commercial reasons. Frehley had been pushing the band to do a heavy rock record since\" Dynasty\", and by the time of \"Creatures of the Night\" he was fully disillusioned with the band, and that combined with alcoholism and a prescription medicine dependency (begun after a car wreck) led to his leaving the band during the recording sessions. On the tour, Vincent was introduced with his Egyptian Ankh make-up, designed in a hurry by Paul Stanley. In 1985, Kiss re-released the album in their non-make-up state with a cover featuring Gene Simmons, Stanley, Eric Carr and then-current guitarist Bruce Kulick (even though Kulick did not play on the album). Vinnie Vincent had long since departed the band (being twice fired) by 1985.\n\nBy 1982, Kiss's popularity in the US had plummeted due to changing music tastes and their near abandonment of hard rock. 1979's \"Dynasty\", while commercially successful, alienated many fans with the disco-flavored track \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\". 1980's \"Unmasked\" fell further into pop music—and was Kiss's first album not to achieve platinum status since 1975's \"Dressed to Kill\". The band did not even tour the US for \"Unmasked\", and it was also soon faced with its first lineup change: founding member Peter Criss, who had not participated in any of the \"Unmasked\" recording sessions, officially left Kiss in 1980. He was replaced by Eric Carr.\n\nFan hopes were raised in late 1980 when Kiss announced that they were going to record their heaviest record yet. Instead, the band released \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" in late 1981, a concept album originally intended to complement a film called \"The Elder\" that was ultimately never filmed. The album was storyline-based and had ballads, a short orchestral piece, and different lyrical themes. The album failed to achieve gold status, and having cancelled their US Unmasked Tour just a short time before, the band then called off the planned tour for \"Music from \"The Elder\"\". Frehley soon left the band.\n\nKiss's label situation had changed as well. Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart had sold the label to its distributor PolyGram, and went on to briefly form The Boardwalk Recording Company before being diagnosed with and later succumbing to cancer. Using a clause in their Casablanca contract that gave the band an option to leave the label if Bogart did, Kiss became free agents and signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Mercury Records. Mercury, a label also owned by PolyGram, reverted the band to their \"old\" label, though in name only.\n\nWhen recording sessions for \"Creatures of the Night\" began in July 1982, Kiss was essentially a trio. Frehley still made appearances with the band but had nearly ended his musical involvement with Kiss. Frehley looked completely out of sorts in promotional appearances for the album; in cases where the band was lip syncing to recorded tracks, he did not know the material. It was only after the album was released and a short promotional tour of Europe was completed that Frehley officially left Kiss. The lead guitar replacement for Frehley for the Creatures of the Night Tour/10th Anniversary Tour in the US was Vinnie Vincent, who adopted the Ankh make-up.\n\nMusically, the progressive rock of \"Music From \"The Elder\"\" and the pop of \"Dynasty\" and \"Unmasked\" were completely absent from \"Creatures of the Night\", making it the heaviest album the group had made at that point. \"I Still Love You\", the only ballad on \"Creatures of the Night\", was still heavier and darker than any ballad Kiss had released in earlier years. Also contributing to the heavy sound was Carr's drumming style, which was more similar to John Bonham's drumming than to Criss' jazz-influenced style. Some of the earliest pressings of the album mistakenly contained one full side of John Cougar's \"American Fool\". Both Kiss and Cougar were under the umbrella of Mercury Records at the time.\n\n\"Creatures of the Night\" is the first Kiss album to have all lead vocal duties handled by either Simmons or Stanley exclusively. All previous studio releases by the group contained at least one song with lead vocals by another band member. The band released a video for \"I Love It Loud\", which received moderate airplay on MTV. In it was a stage setup that featured Carr's drum kit as a giant metallic tank with an exploding turret. Flames and explosions were also in abundance, as Kiss attempted to produce a video that reflected the music on \"Creatures of the Night\". Frehley did appear in the video as the rhythm guitarist, with Stanley shown playing the seven-note solo.\n\nThough Kiss had used \"ghost players\" on previous albums, most notably Bob Kulick (\"Alive II\" and \"Killers\") and Dick Wagner (\"Destroyer)\", Vinnie Vincent handled most of the lead guitar as a session player and co-writer before being added as the full-time replacement for Frehley, though as an employee and not a full member (like Carr). Blues guitarist Robben Ford, a friend of the album's producer Michael James Jackson, contributed two solos in what he described as one of his weirdest gigs. Mr. Mister guitarist Steve Farris (who was considered as a replacement for Frehley but was thought to not have \"the right look\") provided the solo and lead fills to the title track. Co-writer Adam Mitchell also contributed guitar work to the title track. Though often given credit for playing the solos on \"Keep Me Comin\" and \"Danger\", Bob Kulick admitted in a 2011 interview that none of the studio work he did on \"Creatures of the Night\" made it to the album, this confirmed the same from an earlier Mitchell interview. Jimmy Haslip (former member of Blackjack) declared in 2008 that he was invited by James Jackson to record 5 songs (Simmons allegedly refused to play his bass parts due to the end of his relationship with Diana Ross), but Haslip only confirmed that he recorded \"Danger\".\n\nAce Frehley's \"Origins, Vol. 1\" album (2016) included a cover of “Rock and Roll Hell”.\n\nThree official variations on the album artwork exist: the 1982 original issue, the 1985 reissue (featuring Bruce Kulick, who was not a member of the band for \"Creatures of the Night\", and the rest of the band without make-up), and the 1997 remastered version (same photo as the original, but with minor variations in the logo and lettering). On the 1985 non-make-up release, the song \"Creatures of the Night\" is remixed, and \"Saint and Sinner\" and \"Killer\" are interchanged from side to side with each other. The bootlegged Vinnie Vincent cover has not been released on CD, but an extra rare Vincent cover has been called \"Hiding from Tomorrow\". There is also a bootlegged LP which shows up on eBay from time to time and claims to be a Brazilian promo version with Vincent in make-up airbrushed over Frehley.\n\nDespite positive reviews, the album did not return the band to the commercial success they had held five years previous, and despite charting higher than \"The Elder\" (#45 compared to \"The Elder\"'s #75), \"Creatures of the Night\" would not attain gold status until 1994. The album would receive critical recognition with both \"Kerrang!\" and \"Guitar World\" magazines placing the album at #5 on their lists of best hard rock albums in 1982. Carr noted in an interview that \"Creatures\" is his favorite Kiss record that he played on. Simmons and Stanley, who have generally been dismissive of the band's post-1977 albums, considered Creatures to be one of their stronger efforts.\n\n\"Creatures of the Night\" was certified gold by the RIAA on May 9, 1994. It was certified gold in Brazil in 1983 for sales of 100,000 copies.\n\nThe supporting album tour began shortly after Christmas and spanned the first five months of 1983, with the band's itinerary focused almost entirely on North America, with three concerts being played in Brazil, in an attempt to rebuild their diminished US fanbase. However, the Creatures Tour proved to be a bigger failure than the last North American tour in 1979. Kiss played to numerous half-empty arenas on the tour, including venues that the band had sold out or at least played to near-full capacity four years earlier on the Dynasty Tour and shows canceled due to insufficient ticket sales. Despite this, the favourable fan perception of the album has ensured that \"War Machine\", \"I Love It Loud\", and \"Creatures of the Night\" remain Kiss concert staples to this day. Live versions of \"Creatures\" and \"I Love It Loud\" were included on Alive III.\n\n\nKiss\n\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n\nAlbum\nSingles – Billboard (United States)\n\nSingles – Austrian charts (Austria)\nSingles – UK Albums Chart (United Kingdom)\n"}

The words Aue and Au occur in a large number of German place names—including Donau, the German word for the Danube River—and refer to forests, meadows, and wetlands in river and stream lowlands and floodplains. The Danube-Auen National Park protects a large area of lowland forests, meadows, wetlands, and other riparian habitat along the Danube just downstream of Vienna.\n\nThe Park was designated an IUCN category II national park and spans the areas of Vienna (Lobau), Groß-Enzersdorf, Orth an der Donau, Eckartsau, Engelhartstetten, Hainburg, Bad Deutsch-Altenburg, Petronell-Carnuntum, Regelsbrunn, Haslau-Maria Ellend, Fischamend and Schwechat.\n\nUntil the 19th century the Danube was an untamed river. In the 19th century, extensive engineering began to alter the natural balance of the river landscape dramatically. Many side-channels were dammed so that they now carry water from the Danube only at flood stages. Ever more intrusive engineering interventions were accompanied by decades of heavy forestry use in many parts of lowland forests. In the 1950s, development began of a nearly unbroken chain of hydroelectric power plants and associated dams on the Austrian section of the Danube River.\n\nIn 1984, the planned construction of the Hainburg hydroelectric power plant, just downstream from Vienna, threatened the destruction one of two remaining free-flowing sections of the Danube in Austria and its riparian forests (the other remaining free-flowing section in Austria is upstream, near Wachau). An outcry by environmental and nature protection groups caused nationwide protests against the project. The operator of the power plant project disregarded the protests and began work to clear the area. Protests stepped up, eventually leading to the occupation of the Hainburg wetlands by thousands of people from all ages and professions (the so-called \"Hainburg Movement\"). After police tried several times to clear protestors from the area, in December 1984 the Federal Government declared a pause for reflection. In January 1985 the Austrian Supreme Court forbad further deforestation. In March 1985, the so-called Konrad Lorenz-Volksbegehren (petition), signed by 353,906 people, demanded the prohibition of large power plants such as Hainburg and the establishment of a national park in the area of Hainburg. On 1 July 1986, the Administrative Court released a decision cancelling the water rights of the planned power plant.\n\nExtensive scientific studies were then made of the area, with surprising discoveries. More species of fish were observed than was known at the time the planning of the power plant.\n\nThe most important result of these studies was that the Danube lowlands area (Donau-Auen) in and east of Vienna was determined to be worthy of becoming a national park. It was also determined that creating a power plant in the area would not be compatible with national park status for the region. On October 27, 1996, a State Treaty between the Republic of Austria and the federal states of Vienna and Lower Austria was signed. With that treaty, Donau-Auen National Park was officially opened.\n\nIn the National Park area there are more than 700 species of higher plants, more than 30 mammals, 100 species of breeding birds, 8 reptiles, 13 amphibian species, and around 50 species of fish. Among the most characteristic inhabitants of the wetlands of the National Park are the Danube crested newt, European pond turtle, European mudminnow, white-tailed eagle, Eurasian kingfisher, and Eurasian beaver.\n\nWith the variety of insects living on both land and water, and other invertebrates, the total number of species in Donau-Auen National Park is estimated to be at least 5,000.\n\nThe main channel of the Danube was separated from its side channels by the flood control measures that were constructed around the year 1900. The outcome was a higher current velocity in the main channel, with a resulting deepening of the river bed, while in the side channels--which no longer had current flowing through them--sand and loam deposits were no longer removed by the current. In a natural riparian ecosystem woody plants and deadwood have a strong impact on the natural flow dynamics, by stabilizing riverbanks, by reducing erosion, and by creating areas of reducing or increased flow rates, and thus affecting in which areas sediments are deposited or removed. Large tree trunks and accumulations of smaller flotsam cause the water to stagnate and the speed of the current to drop, leading to increased sedimentation.\n\nTo counteract the effects of the flood control measures, beginning in 2002 individual side channels were tied in with the main channel again--at least at high water times--via Gewässervernetzungen (\"water crossings\"), which lower or remove the levees protecting those channels. \n\nIn a 2006 pilot project created with the support of the LIFE+ Program of the European Union and the Austrian riverways agency via donau, about three kilometers of the complete flood works were removed across the river from Hainburg, so that the river once again could spread into the floodplain areas. In a similar project near Witzelsdorf, about one kilometer of the levees were removed. After the completion of the pilot projects in Hainburg and Witzelsdorf, future plans for this river engineering project are for removal of 50% of the levees and flood control works between Vienna and the eastern border of Austria. \n\nAside from a revitalization of the Au (riparian zone), the project promises to mediate the effects of floods on the river and to stabilize the riverbed to the benefit of both river ecology and navigation.\n\n"}

Edith Piaf had one of her biggest hits with the original French version.\n\nThe song was adapted by American songwriter Jack Lawrence in 1954, and he wrote English lyrics, which are considerably different from the French. The English-language title arises in part from a misinterpretation of the French title, as \"pauvre Jean\" was taken for the same-sounding \"pauvres gens,\" which translates as \"poor people.\"\n\nLawrence's lyrics, which pronounce Paris in the French style, as \"PaREE,\" are seldom heard. Most of the popular recordings of the song in the English-speaking world have been instrumentals.\n\nA recording of the tune by Les Baxter's orchestra (Capitol Records catalog number 3336, with the flip side \"Theme from 'Helen of Troy'\") was a number-one hit on the \"Billboard\" chart in the US in 1956: for four weeks on the Best Sellers in Stores chart, for six weeks on the Most Played by Jockeys and Hot 100 charts, and for three weeks on the Most Played on Jukeboxes chart. This recording was also released in Australia by Capitol under catalog number CP-1044. This version of the song was also the last song to reach number one before Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\" topped the chart.\n\nBaxter's version featured strings, brass, a wordless chorus, tinkling percussion, finger snapping, and a group of whistlers.\n\nIn the same year, the piano version by Winifred Atwell (Decca Records catalog number F10681) was number one in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks. In Australia, it was released as Decca Catalogue number Y 6783.\n\n"}

When his elder brother Vasily died young, Dmitry remained the chief heir to his illustrious father. As early as 1259, he was left by Alexander in charge of Novgorod. Upon Alexander's death in 1264, however, the Novgorodians expelled Dmitry to his native Pereslavl-Zalessky, citing his youth as a pretext.\n\nFour years later, when Dmitry had turned 18, he was welcomed back to Novgorod and — together with his future son-in-law, Daumantas of Pskov — led a local militia against Livonian Knights in the Battle of Rakvere. During the following decade, he struggled for control of Novgorod against his uncles, Yaroslav III and Vasily of Kostroma. In 1276, when his elders died, he finally ascended the coveted thrones of Vladimir and Novgorod. Two years later, he founded a great fortress of Koporye, which he intended to rule himself. The Novgorodians revolted, forcing Dmitry to leave Koporye and Novgorod altogether.\n\nWhile Dmitry was preoccupied with pacifying Novgorod, Andrey of Gorodets (Dmitry's younger brother) went to the Golden Horde and received from the khan permission to replace Dmitry as the Grand Prince. In 1281, Andrey returned to Russia, joined his forces with princes of Rostov and Yaroslavl and, after much devastation to Dmitry's lands, seized his capital Pereslavl. Dmitry fled to Koporye but, failing to win support of Novgorodians, had to retreat further northward, probably to Scandinavia.\n\nTwo years later, Dmitry returned to Russia, only to find his lands ravaged by the Mongols and his brother Andrey. Thereupon he went to the Black Sea and met Nogai Khan, who was the greatest enemy of the Golden Horde at that time. Wishing to increase his authority in Russia, Nogai vowed to support Dmitry in his struggle for the grand ducal throne. On hearing about this, Andrey renounced his claims to Vladimir and Novgorod and returned to Gorodets.\n\nIn 1285 Andrey again brought Mongol hordes to Russia, but these were expelled by Dmitry and his allies. Finally, in 1293 Andrey managed to unite the Mongols and Russian princes in opposition to Dmitry. Reluctant to renew fratricidal hostilities, Dmitry took monastic vows in 1293 and died the next year. He was buried in the Saviour Cathedral of Pereslavl-Zalessky.\n\n\n"}

After their break-up, frontman Tim Rutili went on to form Califone, for which many of Red Red Meat's former members, including producer Brian Deck, often record and perform. Tim Hurley went on to form Sin Ropas.\n\nIn 1984, Tim Rutili moved from the suburb of Addison, IL to Chicago in order to attend film school, where he met bassist Glynis Johnson. Together with Ben Massarella, their first band, Friends of Betty, attracted a reasonable following. The 1988 studio album \"Blind Faith II\" included drummer John Rowan. It was not much of a success.\n\nWith new recruit Glenn Girard they renamed the band Red Red Meat. The band's name possibly came from Ben's Truck washing business which cleaned meat carrying trucks on their way out of Chicago. Regarding the band name, Tim Rutili said in an interview: \"I think we just thought it sounded good.\"\n\nRed Red Meat released their first single, \"Hot Nikkety Trunk Monkey\" b/w \"Snowball\" in 1991. They were recorded with Brad Wood at Idful Studios in Chicago. Engineer Brian Deck, who recorded the drums for the session, was asked to become a full-time member behind the kit, after the departure of Ben Massarella, who left for a job as a studio musician.\n\nIt was during the recordings at Idful Studios with Brad Wood that Sub Pop director Jonathan Poneman decided to sign the band making them the first Chicago band on the label. During the summer of 1992, Red Red Meat toured with fellow Chicago group The Smashing Pumpkins. Glynis Johnson left the band after ending a romance between her and Rutili after the tour. Johnson would later contract A.I.D.S. and pass away due to complications that fall. The Smashing Pumpkins wrote a song \"Glynis\" as a tribute, which was released on \"No Alternative\" compilation. Sub Pop released Red Red Meat's second album in early 1994, \"Jimmywine Majestic\". It was a step away from the grunge and general label characteristics of Sub Pop but was generally well received. Massarella returned, instead of replacing Brian Deck on drums, began employing his \"batterie\" techniques. In 1995 Red Red Meat returned with \"Bunny Gets Paid\", which, according to Sub Pop, \"is easily one of the high points of the entire Sub Pop catalog.\" In 1997 Red Red Meat released their final album, \"There's a Star Above the Manger Tonight\".\n\nRed Red Meat has since ended their contract with Sub Pop. They appeared in Scott Petersen's film Out of the Loop, which documents the Chicago indie rock scene. RRM's own Perishable label released Loftus in 1999. a collaboration with New York trio, Rex. Red Red Meat has since disbanded and each member has moved on to other projects. Tim Rutili along with several other Red Red Meat alumni founded Califone, a project which all Red Red Meat members have participated in at one point or another. Brian Deck currently is an American Music Producer based in Chicago, IL.\n\nThough the band has never gone through an official break up, there have been several reunions throughout the years. In 2008 they returned for two shows, at the Hideout in Chicago and at the Sub Pop 25th Anniversary party. Talks of a possible album were thrown about, though nothing has developed and all Red Red Meat members have returned to their full-time positions.\n\nRed Red Meat played three shows in March 2009: two in Chicago followed by an appearance at the Sub Pop showcase at SXSW in Austin, TX.\n\nOn March 24, 2009, Sub Pop released a deluxe edition of 1995's \"Bunny Gets Paid\", which had been out of print for some years.

It is located entirely in the Stranda Municipality. It is a -long branch off the Sunnylvsfjorden, which is a branch off the Storfjorden (Great Fjord). The small village of Geiranger is located at the end of the fjord where the Geirangelva river empties into it.\n\nThe fjord is one of Norway's most visited tourist sites. In 2005, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, jointly with the Nærøyfjorden. This status was challenged by the disputed plans to build power lines across the fjord. \n\nA car ferry, which doubles as a sightseeing trip, is operated by Fjord1 Nordvestlandske. It runs lengthwise along the fjord between the small towns of Geiranger and Hellesylt. The fjord is scheduled to require zero-emissions ships in 2026.\n\nAlong the fjord's sides there lie a number of now-abandoned farms. Some restoration has been made by the \"Storfjordens venner\" association. The most commonly visited among these are Skageflå, Knivsflå, and Blomberg. Skageflå may also be reached on foot from Geiranger, while the others require a boat excursion. The fjord is also host to several impressive waterfalls such as Seven Sisters Falls.\n\nMagdalene Thoresen, Henrik Ibsen's mother-in-law, said of the area:\nThis fjord is surrounded by some of the steepest mountains on the entire west coast. It is very narrow and has no habitable shore area, for the precipitous heights rise in sheer and rugged strata almost straight out of the water. Foaming waterfalls plunge into the fjord from jagged peaks. There are, however, a few mountain farms here, and of these one or two have such hazardous access, by paths that wind around steep precipices, and by bridges that are fixed to the mountain with iron bolts and rings, that they bear witness in a most striking way to the remarkable powers of invention which the challenges of nature have developed in man.\n\nThe two most notable waterfalls in the Geiranger Fjord are Seven Sisters Falls and the Suitor (Nynorsk \"Friaren\"). Both falls face one another across the fjord, and the Suitor is said to be trying to woo the sisters opposite.\n\nThe Bridal Veil is another waterfall in the fjord, so named because it falls delicately over one rocky edge, and when seen backlit by the sun it has the appearance of a thin veil over the rocks.\nThe Geiranger Fjord is under constant threat from the mountain Åkerneset which is about to erode into the fjord. A collapse would produce a tsunami, hitting several nearby towns including Geiranger and Hellesylt in about ten minutes.\n\n\n"}

He served as head football coach of the Navy Midshipmen football team of the United States Naval Academy from 1973 to 1981, and the Virginia Cavaliers football team of the University of Virginia from 1982 to 2000.\n\nWelsh retired as the winningest coach in ACC history. Although that record was later surpassed by Bobby Bowden of Florida State, Welsh remains far and away the most successful coach in UVA history (his 134 wins are more than double those of runner-up Al Groh). He was named ACC Coach of the Year four times (1983, 1984, 1991 and 1995) and National Coach of the Year once (1991).\n\nUpon Welsh's retirement after the 2000 season, his 189 career victories ranked him 24th in Division I-A history.\n\nWelsh was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2004.\n\nWelsh was born in Coaldale, Pennsylvania. He played for the Navy Midshipmen from 1952 to 1955, and was a first-team All-American at quarterback in 1955. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1956, he served as an assistant coach under Rip Engle and Joe Paterno at Penn State from 1963 to 1972. \n\nWelsh began his head coaching career at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1973. He inherited a Navy Midshipmen football program that had only had one winning season since the end of the Roger Staubach era. He led the Midshipmen to three bowl game appearances and their first nine-win season in 16 years. In nine seasons, Welsh compiled a record of 55–46–1. He left as Navy's all-time winningest coach, though he has since been passed by Ken Niumatalolo.\n\nIn 1982, Welsh left Navy to become the head coach of the Virginia Cavaliers, who had just finished a 1-10 season. He walked into a situation even worse than the one he had inherited at Navy. Prior to his arrival, Virginia had only two winning seasons in the previous 29 years and had never been to a post-season bowl game. The Cavaliers had also only one winning record in Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) play, had only finished higher than fourth twice, and had only won 33 conference games in 29 years of ACC play. \n\nWelsh turned around the program quickly. In his third season he led the Cavaliers to their first-ever bowl appearance, a victory in the 1984 Peach Bowl. In 1987, Virginia started a streak of 13 straight seasons with seven or more wins. This stretch included shared ACC titles in 1989 and 1995–to date, the only ACC titles in school history–and 11 additional bowl appearances. His teams also compiled four nine-win seasons, including a school-record 10 wins in 1989. His 1990 team was ranked No. 1 in both polls for two weeks in October—to date, the only time a Division I team from the Commonwealth has been ranked No. 1 in a major poll, and the highest that a team from the Commonwealth has ever been ranked at that point in the season. His 1995 team defeated Florida State 33-28 on November 2, the first time the Seminoles had lost a conference game since joining the conference. \n\nWelsh retired after the 2000 season due to health concerns.\n\nIn 19 years as the Cavaliers' head coach, he became the most successful coach in school and Atlantic Coast Conference history. Before Welsh arrived at Virginia, the Cavaliers had won just 7 of their last 27 yearly football contests against rival Virginia Tech. During Welsh's head coaching career at UVa, his teams went 9-10 against Virginia Tech, including an 8-6 record against Hokies coach Frank Beamer. At one point during Welsh's coaching career at UVA, Virginia won 5 of 6 games against the Hokies, with 3 of the wins coming on Tech's home field. \nUVa firsts accomplished under Welsh:\n\n\nIn 2009, Welsh was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nWelsh died at his home in Virginia on January 2, 2019, at the age of 85.\n\n\n"}

Records of the earliest meeting of the society were written somewhat informally on loose pieces of paper. The first entry in the first minute book of the society is dated 5 April 1736.\n\nIn 1743, Horace Walpole condemned its affectations and described it as \"... a club, for which the nominal qualification is having been in Italy, and the real one, being drunk: the two chiefs are Lord Middlesex and Sir Francis Dashwood, who were seldom sober the whole time they were in Italy.\"\n\nThe group, initially led by Francis Dashwood, contained several dukes and was later joined by Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick, Uvedale Price, and Richard Payne Knight, among others. It was closely associated with Brooks's, one of London's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs. The society quickly became wealthy, through a system in which members made contributions to various funds to support building schemes and archaeological expeditions.\n\nThe first artist associated with the group was George Knapton.\n\nThe Society of Dilettanti aimed to correct and purify the public taste of the country; from the 1740s, it began to support Italian opera. A few years before Sir Joshua Reynolds became a member, the group worked towards the objective of forming a public academy, and from the 1750s, it was the prime mover in establishing the Royal Academy. In 1775, the club had accumulated enough money towards a scholarship fund for the purpose of supporting a student's travel to Rome and Greece, or for archaeological expeditions such as that of Richard Chandler, William Pars, and Nicholas Revett, the results of which they published in \"Ionian Antiquities\", a major influence on neo-Classicism in Britain.\n\nAmong the publications published at the expense of the society was, \"The bronzes of Siris\" (London, 1836), by Danish archaeologist Peter Oluf Bronsted.\n\nThe society has 60 members, elected by secret ballot. An induction ceremony is held at Brooks's, an exclusive London gentleman's club. It makes annual donations to the British Schools in Rome and Athens, and a separate fund set up in 1984 provides financial assistance for visits to classical sites and museums.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

When Şahin Giray fled for his life from his rebellious subjects, and sought succor from his protectress Catherine II in St. Petersburg, Benjamin Aga followed him, hoping to collect the large sums of money that he had advanced to the fugitive. Following the last partition of Poland in 1795, after Crimea had been under Russian rule for over a decade, Vilnius, Lutsk and Trakai came under Russian Rule. Benjamin Aga, Solomon ben Nahamu Bobowitz, and the astronomer Isaac of Kalea, the son-in-law of Jacob Aga, who was the elder brother of Benjamin, went to St. Petersburg as a delegation from the Crimean Karaites, to petition the empress to release their sect from the double rate of taxation which all the Jews then had to pay. Through the intervention of Count Nikolay Zubov, the delegation obtained from the empress the exemption from the \"Jewish\" taxes, some land grants, and other privileges which had not been asked for. This established an important precedent for exempting the Karaites from subsequent anti-Jewish legislation. The extraordinary success of the mission served to arouse great enthusiasm among the Karaites, and Aga and his fellow delegates were received with great honor on their return. A large monolith, fashioned out of marble, with fitting inscription, was erected in the court of the kenesa at Eupatoria, to commemorate an event so important in the history of the Karaites of Russia.\n\n"}

It was the first public appearance without make-up by the band since their very early days, and their first for Mercury Records, where they had been signed following their departure from Casablanca Records.\n\n\"Lick It Up\" built upon the harder sound Kiss had displayed on 1982's \"Creatures of the Night\". It was certified gold on December 22, 1983, the first Kiss album to achieve certification since 1980's \"Unmasked\". This is partially attributable to the increased publicity the band received after their unmasking.\n\nAs soon as the Creatures of the Night Tour/10th Anniversary Tour wrapped up in June, the band immediately went back into the studio to begin work on their next album, which was recorded over the next two months. \"Lick It Up\" and \"All Hell's Breakin' Loose\" were released as singles from the album. They were accompanied by a pair of similarly themed, tongue-in-cheek videos featuring the band (along with many scantily clad women) in desolate, post-apocalyptic settings.\n\nFor the first time, Vinnie Vincent appeared on the cover art for the album, whereas Ace Frehley had appeared on the \"Creatures of the Night\" cover, despite having already left the band and not being involved in the recording of the album. Vincent was not legally a member of the band. Due partly to disputes over what his role in the band and his pay would be (some reports indicated that he had asked for, and was flatly denied, a percentage of the band's gross profits), Vincent never signed any contract making his employment official. These disputes, along with a growing attitude by him that he was solely responsible for the resurgence of Kiss, would lead to him leaving the band (or being fired, depending on the source) after the European leg of the \"Lick It Up\" tour.\n\nWith the band unable to secure a replacement guitarist on such short notice, Vincent was enticed to return for the American leg of the tour; however, his refusal to sign his contract continued to be a sore point. A major rift developed between him and the rest of the band over his guitar solos. What were supposed 5–8 minute solos, timed to finish on a cue so that Paul Stanley could introduce the next song, suddenly expanded in some instances, leaving the rest of the band impatiently waiting on stage for Vincent to finish.\n\nAt an LA Forum show in January 1984, Vincent continued playing despite Stanley's cueing him to finish the solo. The two nearly came to blows in the dressing room afterward, with Stanley accusing Vincent of showing him up, and Vincent accusing the other three members of ruining his solo and trying to hold him back as a performer. They were separated by Eric Carr and Gene Simmons and a couple of roadies who tried to keep the peace. At a March show in Quebec, Canada, as the band prepared to close out their set, Vincent broke into an impromptu solo, leaving the other band members standing onstage with nothing to do. Vincent left (or was fired for a second time, depending on the source) shortly after. This time, the break was permanent.\n\n“Young and Wasted” was occasionally performed with Eric Carr on lead vocals depending on the live show. Usually Stanley would introduce Carr after a brief drum solo, and lead into the segment with either Simmons or Carr performing lead vocals.\n\n\"All Hell's Breakin' Loose\" is one of three songs in the history of the band in which all four (current at the time) members share songwriting credit, the others being \"Love Theme from Kiss\" from their debut album and \"Back to the Stone Age\" from \"Monster\". In an interview for \"\", Stanley made the statement that, \"People were now listening with their eyes rather than their ears, mainly because \"Creatures of the Night\" was arguably a better album than \"Lick It Up\". He also made the statement that, \"The only reason why I think people bought \"Lick It Up\" more than \"Creatures of the Night\" was because we had no make-up on. That was the only reason.\"\n\nWhile Vincent contributed lead guitar to six songs on \"Creatures of the Night\" as a session player, by the time \"Lick it Up \"was released and for all the public knew, he was officially the guitarist in Kiss and played all the lead guitar on the album. The opening track (co-written by Vincent) features a solo from Rick Derringer.\n\n\"Lick It Up\" was certified platinum on December 19, 1990. It was placed at #10 on Guitar World's Readers Poll of the Top-10 Guitar Albums of 1983. \"Kerrang!\" listed \"Lick It Up\" #3 on its list of the best hard rock albums in 1983. The album marked a turnaround in the band's flagging fortunes during the previous several years and successfully introduced them to a new generation of fans, as well as marking the beginning of the \"unmasked\" era that would last for the next decade.\n\nStanley has stated in some interviews that he felt that the album sold well mainly due to the hype surrounding the band's unmasking.\n\nThe Lick It Up World Tour began in October, one month after the album's release, and focused on Europe during the autumn, with the US leg taking place from December to March. The American leg of the tour has been seen as commercially disappointing by writer Kurt Gooch, who has believed that Kiss alienated many longtime fans by eschewing the iconic makeup.\n\nThe title track \"Lick It Up\" remains a staple of the ensemble's live performances, having been played over 1,300 times as of August 2015; however, the rest of the album is rarely played live.\n\nKiss\n\nAdditional musician\n\nAlbum\nSingles \n"}

In 1912 he was appointed second director at the Zoological State Collection of Munich, where in 1917 he became director. From 1924 to 1937 he was a full professor and director of the zoological museum in Berlin.\n\nThe crustacean genus \"Zimmeriana\" (; family Gynodiastylidae) commemorates his name, as do species with the epithet of \"zimmeri\", including three species frogs (\"Arthroleptis zimmeri\", \"Oreophryne zimmeri\", and \"Pseudophilautus zimmeri\"). He is the taxonomic authority for the krill species \"Euphausia hanseni\".\n\n"}

All lines have since been abandoned.\n\nNote, that although the above description implies the Morrissey/Sullivan fight (and resulting riot) was a primary cause for the annexation; those events actually took place on October 12, 1853, twelve weeks after the cession was agreed to by both states but more than a year before Congress made the transfer official.\n\n"}
{"id": "2232896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232896", "title": "Hollinwood, Greater Manchester", "text": "Hollinwood, Greater Manchester\n\nHollinwood is an area and electoral ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, Greater Manchester, England. The population at the 2011 census was 10,920.\n\nBisected by the A62 road, Hollinwood is southwest of Oldham, contiguous with the towns of Chadderton and Failsworth, at Junction 22 of the M60 motorway.\n\nHistorically part of Lancashire, Hollinwood in pre-industrial times was a moor or common on the borders of Chadderton and Oldham. The rights to the land were disputed by the townships with Chadderton claiming 8 acres, but a 1713 court settlement stipulated that Hollinwood Moor should be within Oldham. The mid to late 18th century saw Hollinwood develop into a village. Mid 19th century gazetteers described Hollinwood as 'an extensive village in the townships of Chadderton and Oldham'. In 1880 there were further exchanges of land in the Hollinwood area between Oldham Borough and Chadderton township.\n\nJames Butterworth (1826) described it as being of 66.5 Cheshire acres (approx. 140 statute acres). It was enclosed by the Oldham Enclosure Acts (42 and 43 George III; May 1802). Hollinwood's mills such as the Heron, Fox, Asia, Wharf, Richmond and Park were later built on what had been the Hollinwood Common. The Chapel Road playing fields is one of the few open spaces remaining in the district. The pitches occupy the site of a former reservoir serving a now-defunct stretch of the Hollinwood Branch Canal.\nLong existing as an industrial district, Hollinwood is today home to the Northern Counties Housing Association, and Mirror Colour Print Ltd; the printing division of the Trinity Mirror group, which prints and distributes thirty-six major newspapers, and employs five hundred staff.\n\nFrom the late 19th century, the area was largely occupied by workers in Oldham's cotton mills and miners at the large collieries at Oak and Bower, and several smaller ones. Much of Hollinwood's more recent growth was due to the Ferranti factory which produced power transformers in its heyday. Later the factory produced container lifting trucks as the building had the height to do so. The transformer works building, built after the war on the old Bower site, is now used as a newspaper printing plant. A neighbouring, much older, Ferranti factory produced electricity meters. The meter factory was sold to Siemens in the 1980s and became known as FML; Siemens later closed the FML factory.\n\nHollinwood was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. The tornado later moved over Oldham town centre, causing further damage.\n\nUntil its closure in 2005 Hollinwood was home to the popular Roxy Cinema. The Roxy opened on 20 December 1937 screening the film 'Fire Over England'. Seating was provided in stalls and circle levels for 1,406 and there was a cinema cafe. In 1978 the cinema was split into two screens, then in 1981 it became a three screen cinema. Further sub-division occurred to create six screens which seated:470, 130, 260, 260 320 and 96. In 1998 a seventh screen was added. In 2002 the Roxy received a £100,000 upgrade. After closure the Roxy was subsequently demolished in February 2007.\n\nSeveral other cinemas existed in the Hollinwood area during the early to mid 20th century period including the La Scala and The Queens.\n\nHollinwood was once a chapelry of the ecclesiastical parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham, in the Hundred of Salford. The Parish Church, St. Margret of Antioch is still under the patronage of the Rector of Prestwich, though this position is currently suspended.\n\nUntil local government re-organisation in 1974, part of Hollinwood lay within the Chadderton Urban District in the administrative county of Lancashire. This area is now divided between the Hollinwood and South Chadderton ward districts.\n\nAs part of the town of Oldham, Hollinwood forms part of the wider Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. Politically, the Hollinwood ward is currently represented by the Labour Party with three councillors.\n\nThe boundaries of the Hollinwood ward were changed in 2003 following a Boundary Commission review. The part of Hollinwood lying west of the M60 motorway now lies in Failsworth East ward while part of Oldham St Paul's ward was transferred to Hollinwood. The ward currently comprises the rest of Hollinwood and the adjoining localities of Hollins, Garden Suburb and Limeside (also known as Limehurst Village).\n\nHollinwood is part of the parliamentary constituency of Oldham West and Royton.\n\nHollinwood is included in the 5% most economically deprived wards in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Hollinwood Branch Canal used to pass through the district. The last vestiges of the canal in Hollinwood were destroyed by the works for the M60 motorway. Those parts of the branch canal which still exist are not in Hollinwood.\n\nHollinwood was changed substantially by the M60 motorway (completed in 2000) which passes to the south of Manchester.\n\nPrior to 1760, the villagers of Hollinwood would have to travel to Oldham St Mary's for services. The emergence of a village at Hollinwood during the mid 18th century necessitated the building of a church there. The new church dedicated to St. Margaret of Antioch (Church of England) was completed by 1768 and was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester on 8 July 1769. The builder was Edmund Whitehead, and an account of his work was recorded on his gravestone in the churchyard. It is said that the cost of building was only £500 and that a grant towards this was received from Queen Anne's Bounty. The church was smaller than the present building and when built had no tower, the current church building dating from 1877. A tower was added in 1904. The church is a grade II listed building.\n\nRecent years has seen further restoration. Grants from English Heritage, the Heritage Lottery Fund, National Churches Trust and others have allowed the church to complete two major restoration projects to date: phase one – restoration of the tower, and phase two – the replacement and restoration of the roofs of the north aisle, nave, transept, chancel and sacristy. Further funding for urgent roof restoration work was secured in 2017, saving the church from closure.\n\nThe late 19th century saw a number of churches established in Hollinwood, many of which have now closed including:-\n\nThe Memorial Church - It was founded before 1895 and closed in 1988. The Hollinwood Congregational Church (earlier in its history known as The Memorial Church or Chapel) was situated on the corner where Pump Street intersected with Manchester Road. The church building faced onto Manchester Road with the Sunday School building behind it taking the length of Pump Street. In view of plans for the motorway and declining numbers the church building was sold and the church united with Beulah Baptist Church where the members continue to meet and worship. The building, which had become a warehouse, has since been demolished. It was well known because of the prominence of its clock tower.\n\nSt James (Free Church of England). It was founded in 1870. The original church closed in 1972 for widening the A62 Road when they moved to Byron Street/Grammar School Road. The church closed in 2008.\n\nBeulah (Baptist), Withins Road, founded in 1891 and still in existence.\n\nBethesda (Baptist), Milton Street, founded in 1895, closed at a date unknown.\n\nHollins Road (Baptist), circa late 19th century, date of closure unknown.\n\nAlford Street (Welsh Congregational), it was founded before 1892. It closed in 1978.\n\nHudson Street (Methodist), it was founded in 1877. It closed in 1976.\n\nBourne Street (Methodist), it was founded in 1832 and closed in 1922.\n\nByron Street/Hive Street (Spiritualist), circa late 19th century, date of closure unknown\n\nHoly Family (Roman Catholic), Roman Road, founded in 1958–present. Prior to 1958 Holy Family parish was a constituent part of the extensive parish of Corpus Christi which included all of Hollinwood, Hollins, Limeside, parts of Werneth and much of central and south Chadderton.\n\nBible Mission Church, Old Lane, founded in 1896.\n\nSalvation Army, Manchester Road. Founded: 1925 Closed: 1995\n\nHollins Road (Methodist), it was founded in 1894. It closed in 1960.\n\nSt John (Manchester Road, Methodist), it was founded in 1839. It closed in 1958.\n\nHollins (Methodist), Millgate, founded in 1840. Still open in 2015.\n\nHollinwood is linked to Manchester and Oldham via the A62 road. The M60 motorway links the area to Stockport, Manchester Airport and the Trafford Centre.\n\nThe area is served by Hollinwood tram stop on the Manchester Metrolink line between and Rochdale. Services generally run every 12 minutes in each direction during the day. The area was previously served by Hollinwood railway station, which was part of the Oldham Loop Line. However, the line closed in October 2009 and the converted line reopened in June 2012.\n\nThere are frequent buses running through Hollinwood between Manchester city centre and Oldham on First Greater Manchester's 83 overground service. There is also a frequent services running towards Manchester city centre with services 180 and 184 and to Huddersfield/Saddleworth via Oldham. These were once Limited Stop (Express) services but lost this status in 2004. Other destinations which can be reached from Hollinwood on the bus are Ashton-under-Lyne, Chadderton, Huddersfield and Saddleworth.\n\nBritish Olympic freestyle swimming champion, Henry Taylor was born in Hollinwood.\n\nProlific twentieth-century hangman Albert Pierrepoint owned a public house on Manchester Road named \"Help the Poor Struggler\". This pub however was demolished when work began on the M60 motorway.\n\nHannah Beswick ( – 1785), from Birchin Bower in Hollinwood, had a pathological fear of premature burial. Her fear was such that her will specified her body be kept aboveground, and that once a year, in the presence of two witnesses, the veil was to be lifted from her face, to look for signs of life. This eccentric will made Beswick a celebrity, and her mummified body was donated to the Manchester Museum and put on public display in the entrance hall, with the soubriquet \"Manchester Mummy\".\n"}
