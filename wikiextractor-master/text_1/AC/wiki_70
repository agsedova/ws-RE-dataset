After apartheid had ended he concentrated more on the country's landscapes. What differentiates Goldblatt's body of work from those of other anti-apartheid artists is that he photographed issues that went beyond the violent events of apartheid and reflected the conditions that led up to them. His forms of protest have a subtlety that traditional documentary photographs may lack: \"[M]y dispassion was an attitude in which I tried to avoid easy judgments. . . . This resulted in a photography that appeared to be disengaged and apolitical, but which was in fact the opposite.\" He has numerous publications to his name.\n\nGoldblatt was born in Randfontein, Gauteng Province, and was the youngest of the three sons of Eli and Olga Goldblatt. His grandparents arrived in South Africa from Lithuania around 1893, having fled the persecution of Jews there.\n\nGoldblatt's father ran a clothing store, where his mother worked as a typist for a clothing company, which Goldblatt speculated may have been how they met. Goldblatt attended Krugersdorp High School, and graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand with a degree in commerce.\n\nGoldblatt began photographing when he was a teenager. He got his first camera from his father, who bought it from Goldblatt's brother, who had brought home a damaged German Contax camera when he came back from serving in World War II. Though his first photographs were not groundbreaking, he enlisted help from a wedding photographer: \"He would drape several cameras around my neck so that I looked very professional, and my job was to ensure that no guest with a good camera got a good picture . . . I would have to bump or walk in front of them at the critical moment so that my boss was the only person who ended up with good photographs.” A couple years later in 1963, as his skill developed, he sold the clothing shop that he had taken over on the death of his father in 1962, and became a full-time photographer. He documented developments in South Africa through the period of apartheid until it ended in the 1990s. However he was still making photographs up until his death in 2018. \n\nThroughout his years as a photographer, Goldblatt never saw himself as an artist, and he was uncomfortable being seen as one. Many agree that he was a documentarian more than he was an artist. Goldblatt had an innovative approach to documentary photography. He made a life of photographing the issues that went beyond the events of apartheid and documented the conditions that led to them. Goldblatt was never comfortable with the fine art world. He went to exhibition openings but secretly hated the attention they threw upon him. He got around the label of artist by simply calling himself a photographer. He said: \"I am a self-appointed observer and critic of the society into which I was born, with a tendency to giving recognition to what is overlooked or unseen.\"\n\nGoldblatt's photography was not obviously politically charged. He claimed he was not an activist, unlike the majority of his friends and other photographers during this time. He in turn was looked down upon and disrespected for not involving himself in activism, on which he commented: \"I wasn't prepared to compromise what I regarded as my particular needs.\"\n\nDuring Apartheid, Goldblatt in his work \"The Transported of KwaNdebele\" documented the excruciatingly long and uncomfortable twice-daily bus journeys of black workers who lived in the segregated \"homelands\" northeast of Pretoria. The conditions had not changed that much for workers by 2007: \"The bulk of people who live there still have to travel to Pretoria by road. It's still a very long commute for them every day – two to eight hours. . . . It will take generations to undo the consequences of Apartheid.\"\n\nAfter apartheid, Goldblatt continued to photograph within South Africa, particularly its landscapes.\n\nIn the work Goldblatt created during apartheid he never photographed in colour. Goldblatt observed that: \"the use of colour during apartheid would have been inappropriate. It would have enhanced the beautiful and the personal, whereas black and white photographs to more effectively documented the external dramatic contradictions that defined this earlier period.\" In the 1990s he began working in colour, in a sense adapting to the digital age. \"I’ve found the venture into color quite exciting . . . largely because new technology has enabled me to work with color on the computer as I have done with black and white in the darkroom.\" It was only after working on a project involving blue asbestos in north-western Australia, and \"the resulting disease and death\", that he \"got hooked on doing work in color [because] You can’t make it blue in black and white.\" \n\nThis was coupled with new developments in digital scanning and printing. Only when Goldblatt was able to achieve the same \"depth\" in his colour work that he had previously achieved in his black and white photography did he choose to explore this extensively.\n\nGoldblatt's work is held in major museum collections worldwide.\n\nInterest in Goldblatt's work increased significantly after a travelling exhibition of 51 years of his work (Barcelona, 2001), and the eleventh \"Documenta\" (Kassel, 2002). The former, which opened in the AXA Gallery in New York in 2001, offered an overview of Goldblatt's photographic oeuvre from 1948 to 1999. At \"Documenta\", two projects were shown: black-and-white work depicting life in the middle-class white community of Boksburg in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as examples of later colour work from the series \"Johannesburg Intersections.\"\n\nGoldblatt's book \"South Africa: The Structure of Things Then,\" published in 1998, offers an in-depth visual analysis of the relationship between South Africa's structures and the forces that shaped them, from the country's early colonial beginnings up until 1990.\n\nGoldblatt was inspired by photography in magazines such as \"Life\", \"Look\" and \"Picture Post\", which helped him with things such as captioning his photographs. Goldblatt also cited writers and visual artists as his major influences, among them Jillian Becker, Guy Tillim, Herman Charles Bosman, Nadine Gordimer, Njabulo Ndebele, Ivan Vladislavic and playwright Barney Simon. \n\nHerman Charles Bosman specifically helped inspire Goldblatt in his second photo essay titled \"The South African Tatler\".\n\nGoldblatt helped influence the work of the photographer Santu Mofokeng as they studied together during the time of apartheid. Together they helped reinvent documentary and conceptual modes of photography, which led them to prominence and influence within documentary photography.\n\nAfter founding the Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg in 1989, Goldblatt turned no photographer, struggling or famous away from his door. He was always accessible to everyone no matter what, even in his later life.\n\nGoldblatt died on 25 June 2018 in Johannesburg from cancer. He had created photographs up until his death. He was survived by his wife, Lily Goldblatt and his children Steven, Brenda and Ronnie; and two grandchildren.\n\n\n\nGoldblatt's work is held in the following permanent public collections:\n\n"}
{"id": "2145273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145273", "title": "M-ary tree", "text": "M-ary tree\n\nIn graph theory, an \"m-ary tree (also known as \"k-ary or \"k\"-way tree) is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than \"m\" children. A binary tree is the special case where \"m = 2\", and a ternary tree is another case with \"m = 3\" that limits its children to three.\n\n\n\n\nTraversing a \"m\"-ary tree is very similar to binary tree traversal. The pre-order traversal goes to parent, left subtree and the right subtree, and for traversing post-order it goes by left subtree, right subtree, and parent node. For traversing in-order, since there are more than two children per node for \"m > 2\", one must define the notion of \"left\" and \"right\" subtrees. One common method to establish left/right subtrees is to divide the list of children nodes into two groups. By defining an order on the \"m\" children of a node, the first formula_8 nodes would constitute the left subtree and formula_9 nodes would constitute the right subtree.\n\nUsing an array for representing a \"m-\"ary tree is inefficient, because most of the nodes in practical applications contain less than \"m\" children. As a result, this fact leads to a sparse array with large unused space in the memory. Converting an arbitrary \"m-\"ary tree to a binary tree would only increase the height of the tree by a constant factor and would not affect the overall worst-case time complexity. In other words, formula_10 since \nformula_11.\n\nFirst, we link all the immediate children nodes of a given parent node together in order to form a link list. Then, we keep the link from the parent to the first (i.e., the leftmost) child and remove all the other links to the rest of the children. We repeat this process for all the children (if they have any children) until we have processed all the internal nodes and rotate the tree by 45 degrees clockwise. The tree obtained is the desired binary tree obtained from the given \"m\"-ary tree.\n\n\"m\"-ary trees can also be stored in breadth-first order as an implicit data structure in arrays, and if the tree is a complete \"m\"-ary tree, this method wastes no space. In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index \"i\", its \"c\"-th child in range {1...,\"m\"} is found at index formula_12, while its parent (if any) is found at index \"formula_13\" (assuming the root has index zero, meaning a 0-based array). This method benefits from more compact storage and better locality of reference, particularly during a preorder traversal. The space complexity of this method is formula_14.\n\nEach node would have an internal array for storing pointers to each of its formula_15 children:\n\nCompared to array-based implementation, this implementation method has superior space complexity of formula_16.\n\nListing all possible \"m\"-ary trees are useful in many disciplines as a way of checking hypothesis or theories.\nProper representation of \"m-\"ary tree objects can greatly simplify the generation process. One can construct a \"bit sequence representation\" using the depth-first search of a \"m\"-ary tree with \"n\" nodes indicating the presence of a node at a given index using binary values. For example, the bit sequence \"x=1110000100010001000\" is representing a 3-ary tree with \"n=6\" nodes as shown below.\nThe problem with this representation is that listing all bit strings in lexicographic order would mean two successive strings might represent two trees that are lexicographically very different. Therefore, enumeration over binary strings would not necessarily result in an ordered generation of all \"m-\"ary trees. A better representation is based on an integer string that indicates the number of zeroes between successive ones, known as \"Simple Zero Sequence\". formula_17 is a Simple Zero Sequence corresponding to the bit sequence formula_18 where \"j\" is the number of zeroes needed at the tail end of the sequence to make the string have the appropriate length. For example, formula_19 is the simple zero sequence representation of the above figure. A more compact representation of \"00433\" is formula_20, which is called \"zero sequence\", which duplicate bases cannot be adjacent. This new representation allows to construct a next valid sequence in formula_21.\nA simple zero sequence is valid if \nformula_22, that is to say that number of zeros in the bit sequence of a \"m\"-ary tree cannot exceed the total number of null pointers (i.e., pointers without any child node attached to them). This summation is putting restriction on formula_23 nodes so that there is room for adding the formula_24 without creating an invalid stracture (i.e. having an available null pointer to attached the last node to it).\n\nThe table below shows the list of all valid simple zero sequences of all \"3\"-ary trees with 4 nodes:\n\nStarting from the bottom right of the table (i.e., \"000\"), there is a \"backbone template\" that governs the generation of the possible ordered trees starting from \"000\" to \"006\". The backbone template for this group (\"00X\") is depicted below, where an additional node is added in the positions labeled \"x\".\n\nOnce one has exhausted all possible positions in the backbone template, a new template will be constructed by shifting the 3rd node one position to the right as depicted below, and the same enumeration would occur until all possible positions labeled \"X\" is exhausted. \n\nGoing back to the table of enumeration of all \"m\"-ary trees, where formula_25 and formula_26, we can easily observe the apparent jump from \"006\" to \"010\" can be explained trivially in an algorithmic fashion as depicted below:\n\nThe pseudocode for this enumeration is given below:\n\nA generation algorithm that takes formula_21 worst-case time are called loopless since the time complexity cannot involve a loop or recursion. Loopless enumeration of \"m-\"ary trees is said to be loopless if after initialization, it generates successive tree objects in formula_21. For a given a \"m-\"ary tree \"T\" with formula_36 being one of its nodes and formula_37 its formula_38 child, a \"left-t rotation\" at formula_36 is done by making formula_37 the root node, and making formula_41 and all of its subtrees a child of formula_36, additionally we assign the formula_43 left most children of formula_37 to formula_36 and the right most child of formula_37 stays attached to it while formula_37 is promoted to root, as shown below:\n\nA \"right-t rotation\" at \"d\" is the inverse of this operation. The \"left chain\" of \"T\" is a sequence of formula_51 nodes such that formula_52 is the root and all nodes except formula_53 have one child connected to their left most (i.e., formula_54) pointer. Any \"m-\"ary tree can be transformed to a \"left-chain\" tree using sequence of finite \"left-t rotations\" for \"t\" from \"2\" to \"m\". Specifically, this can be done by performing left-t rotations on each node formula_55 until all of its formula_43 sub-tree become \"null\" at each depth. Then, the sequence of number of left-t rotations performed at depth \"i\" denoted by formula_57 defines a \"codeword\" of a \"m-\"ary tree that can be recovered by performing the same sequence of right-t rotations.\n\nLet the formula_43 tuple of formula_59 represent the number of \"L-2\" rotations, \"L-3\" rotations, ..., \"L-m\" rotations that has occurred at the root (i.e., i=1).Then, formula_60 is the number of \"L-t\" rotations required at depth \"i\".\n\nCapturing counts of left-rotations at each depth is a way of encoding an \"m\"-ary tree. Thus, enumerating all possible legal encoding would helps us to generate all the \"m\"-ary trees for a given \"m\" and \"n\". But, not all formula_57 sequences of \"m\" non-negative integers represent a valid m-ary tree. A sequence of formula_62 non-negative integers is a valid representation of a \"m-\"ary tree if and only if \nformula_63\n\nLexicographically smallest code-word representation of a \"m-ary\" with \"n\" nodes is all zeros and the largest is \"n-1\" ones followed by \"m-1\" zero on its right.\n\nOne of the applications of \"m\"-ary tree is creating a dictionary for validation of acceptable strings. In order to do that, let \"m\" be equal to the number of valid alphabets (e.g., number of letters of the English alphabet) with the root of the tree representing the starting point. Similarly, each of the children can have up to \"m\" children representing the next possible character in the string. Thus, characters along the paths can represent valid keys by marking the end character of the keys as \"terminal node\". For example, in the example below \"at\" and \"and\" are valid key strings with \"t\" and \"d\" marked as terminal nodes. Terminal nodes can store extra information to be associated with a given key. There are similar ways to building such a dictionary using B-tree, Octree and/or trie.\n\n"}

He has worked in the music business as a producer, talent manager and record executive. He has been involved in the careers of a variety of recording artists and performers throughout his career.\n\nMedina was born in East Los Angeles of Dominican parents into a poor family. The death of his mother and abandonment by his father resulted in him being placed into a number of foster homes, which he repeatedly ran away from before he and his siblings were taken in by his aunt. In his early teenage years Medina dealt joints and amphetamines. A critical event in his childhood was the befriendment of a wealthy white teenager, whose family in Beverly Hills allowed him to live in a refurbished garage behind their property. Medina then attended Beverly Hills High where he met Kerry Gordy and was a successful student. Medina's experiences of transferring to this wealthy environment is the loose basis for the 1990 Will Smith show \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\".\n\nMedina started his career with the group Apollo, who released their self-titled debut on Gordy/Motown in 1979. Medina was the lead singer, other members included Kerry Gordy (keyboards), Cliff Liles (bass), Lenny Greene (drums) and Larry Robinson (guitar). Medina co-wrote three of the seven tracks, including “Astro Disco,” for which they are best known. The album was produced by Ray Singleton, former wife of Motown founder Berry Gordy.\n\nAt age 24, Medina became the head of A&R for Motown, working as a protégé to Berry Gordy. Under Gordy, Medina wrote and produced for legendary Motown acts such as The Temptations, Smokey Robinson, Billy Preston, Rick James and Teena Marie.\n\nMedina then moved on to Warner Bros. Records, where executive Mo Ostin tasked him to build and cultivate the careers of the company's urban artists as VP/GM of its urban-music division. While there, Medina collaborated with artists such as Ray Charles, Babyface, Prince, Chaka Khan, Madonna, Paul Simon and Fleetwood Mac. He also worked with Naughty by Nature, Queen Latifah, De La Soul, Biz Markie, Kool G. Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Roxanne Shanté, and Monie Love.\n\nAfter leaving Warner Bros., Medina and longtime friend Jeff Pollack formed Medina/Pollack Entertainment, which grew into a full service management and production company. They masterminded a variety of projects, including \"Booty Call\", \"Above the Rim\", and \"Maid in Manhattan\".\n\nIn early 2009, Benny Medina formed another company called the Medina Company.\n\nMedina is best known for managing actress/singer/dancer Jennifer Lopez. Along with Lopez and then-head of Sony Music, Tommy Mottola, Medina launched Lopez's pop music career in 1999, after which he and Lopez worked intensively together building a dominant film, music, fragrance and clothing empire. In 2003, at the height of her popularity, Lopez and Medina had a public falling out, and split. They remained in contact with each other, and unofficially reunited during late 2007. As of 2008, Medina officially resumed his role as Lopez's manager, and is also a godparent to her twin children.\n\nOther clients were also managed by Medina to lesser extents, including Tyra Banks, whom Medina helped to create a largely successful television and fashion career. Medina managed Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs and aided in the launch of the Sean John apparel and fragrance empire. He has also managed singer Mariah Carey, one of the biggest stars in the world of Tommy Mottola (his close colleague while working with Lopez) before being let go in September 2008. Medina was also dismissed by actress/recording artist Brandy (fired him in 2004), and R&B singer Usher (who fired him in 2008). Medina also managed singer-songwriter Vanessa Daou from 1996-1998 while the artist was signed to Krasnow Entertainment/MCA Records. When Daou chose to leave with label head Bob Krasnow and find a way out of her contractual obligations to MCA in 1998, Medina and his company Handprint Entertainmant, along with Daou, co-released the artist's internet-only album release 'Plutonium Glow'. \n\nIn November 2017, actor Jason Dottley accused Medina of attempting to rape him in December 2008. Dottley stated the event happened at Medina's Los Angeles mansion after Medina gave Dottley and fellow actor T. Ashanti Mozelle a tour of the home. Dottley stated in an interview with \"The Advocate\" that Anthony Rapp's recent sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey inspired him to come out with his \"shameful secret.\" Through his attorneys Howard Weitzman and Shawn Holley, Medina said in a statement, \"Benny Medina categorically denies the allegation of attempted rape.\"\n\nMedina is gay. In March 2007, he was ranked as one of \"Out.com\"'s Top 50 Gays, coming in at spot 48.\n"}

He also worked as Assistant Trial Staff Counsel for the U.S. Labor Relations Board. During this period, Speer developed a working relationship with A. Jay Cristol who is now Senior Federal Judge of the Southern Federal Bankruptcy Court. After leaving Tallahassee, he became a chief lobbyist for the City of St. Petersburg, specializing in water rights and laws. Later, Speer was appointed Assistant State Attorney for Pinellas County by Governor Haydon Burns. He then practiced law with John DeVito and Elizabeth A. Kovachevich, who is now a Senior Federal Judge. He dated Elizabeth A. Kovachevich in law school.\n\nSpeer established his first of many business partnerships with Estlon and JoAnn Pippin, experienced single-family homebuilders in Pasco County, Florida. They formed Tahitian Homes, Inc. and proceeded to build homes in western Pasco County. Later, Speer expanded his real estate development activities into a large multi-corporation company called Lanbanque, Inc. In order to supply utilities to his ever-expanding real estate projects, Speer and the Pippins established Aloha Utilities, Inc. which was the largest private water and sewer utility in Pasco County. During a slow-down in the real estate business, Speer spent three years in Europe, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait formulating TACET (Technology and Capital Exchange Trust). \n\nSpeer was also involved in growing vegetables in Puerto Rico; he owned a beautician school, restaurants, lounges, a marina, marine dredging, data processing services, multi-level marketing of vitamins and cosmetics, cement block manufacturing, country-western music publishing and recording studios, telecommunications companies, a high-end boutique shop, general insurance agency, internet connection and data center, a walk-in medical clinic, wholesale gasoline and diesel fuel distribution operation, a travel agency, home security monitoring, mail order medical and diabetic supply company, a Big & Tall men's clothing store, an AM radio station, a mobile medical screening company, a book publishing company, a warehouse fulfillment and distribution company, an advertising media consulting firm, television stations, mobile home parks, a 225 room hotel in Nassau, Bahamas, a 500,000 square foot commercial warehouse complex in Las Vegas, and a five-star 23 story resort hotel and residences on Ft. Lauderdale Beach. \n\nIn early 1980, Speer formed U.S. Hydrocarbons Drilling and Development, Inc., and oil and gas drilling exploration operation in southeastern Texas. Within a few years the world market price of oil decreased drastically causing the business to fail. There were numerous Texas banks supported by Speer's personal guarantee. The banks forced him into bankruptcy. Over the next four years Speer successfully emerged from bankruptcy with all unpaid claims fully satisfied. \n\nSpeer founded the Roy M. Speer Foundation in 1986. The foundation has donated to the Dr. Parker Mahan Facial Pain Center at the University of Florida College of Dentistry, Pasco County YMCA Family Center, The Florida Orchestra, Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Presidential Prayer Team, Hurricane Relief Fund, New Port Richey's Super Playground, Billy Graham Crusade, and local Christian churches.\n\nDuring this tumultuous and intense period of significant litigation when most other business men would have become extremely wary of risky speculations, Speer forged ahead. In 1982, he and Bud Paxson formed Home Shopping Network to sell merchandise on television using a local cable network. This developed as an offshoot of an AM radio program. This became an ideal platform for Speer to apply his years of legal and business expertise. The effort created a completely new industry - retail merchandising through television. When the local venture expanded dramatically, they acquired access on a satellite channel in 1985, enabling the company to sell merchandise throughout the United States from the Clearwater facility. On May 13, 1986, Home Shopping Network went public on the American Stock Exchange. Within five years, the company would achieve over one billion dollars in annual net sales, a testament to Speer's vision and leadership. The success of this venture was so impressive that the Harvard M.B.A. Program assigned its students to analyze and critique the company's success.\n\nIn 1993, Speer was charged in a class-action suit that alleged he improperly accepted compensation from vendors; that the Company paid Nando DiFilippo, former executive vice-president, general counsel and secretary of the Company, to prevent him from disclosing such vendor bribes; and that the Company had failed to properly disclose certain related party transactions in its filings with the SEC.\n\nAlso in 1993, another suit was brought against Speer alleging a breach of fiduciary duties owed to the Company and its stockholders by failure to exercise due care and diligence in the management and administration of the affairs of the Company. The suit challenged the validity of a license agreement with Richard Speer (Roy Speer's son) pursuant to which the Company was given the exclusive rights to certain software and alleges that the Company wrongfully made payments to Richard Speer pursuant to a computer services agreement which was allegedly terminated. The suit alleged that the Company wrongfully made payments to Richard Speer of $3,502,000, $3,286,000 and $3,084,000 during the Company's 1992, 1991 and 1990 fiscal years, respectively, pursuant to the agreement. Merchandise that is unsuitable for sale via the Company's programs or outlet stores was sold by Richard Speer, who received a commission of 15% on the amount realized upon disposition. Richard Speer received $1,469,000, $1,615,000 and $1,427,000 and through this arrangement during the Company's 1992, 1991 and 1990 fiscal years, respectively. The suit also alleged that this 15% commission was commercially unreasonable. The suit alleged that the above-described arrangements would not have been entered into by the Company with an unrelated third party and that Roy and Richard Speer owned undisclosed interests in unspecified firms which sell merchandise to the Company. Speer settled all claims with the Plaintiffs before they ever went to trial.\n\nHe resigned from the Home Shopping Network in 1993.\n\nSpeer married Lynnda Short on July 22, 1960 at Calvary Baptist Church in Clearwater, Florida. They had two children, Richard Merrill Speer and Lisa Lynn Vickers. Roy also had a son, Robert R. Speer, from a previous marriage. He was Christian.\n\nAfter his death in 2012, Lynnda, acting as Speer's personal representative, filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley for $400 million.\n"}

It is considered one of the most influential skate videos, as director Spike Jonze's format is frequently cited as its definitive filming template.\n\n\"Video Days\" is the first movie/video directed by Spike Jonze and stars Mark Gonzales, Rudy Johnson, Jason Lee, Guy Mariano and Jordan Richter. Legendary professional skateboarder Danny Way was briefly on Blind Skateboards from 1990–1991 and shot some footage for \"Video Days\". However, he soon quit Blind, returning to his original team H-Street Skateboards and his footage for \"Video Days\" was omitted. A brief shot of Way can be seen during Mark Gonzales' part in this video.\n\nThe film starts off with footage of all 5 skaters driving around in a Blue Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency accompanied to the song \"Low Rider\" by War; this car becomes the central theme for the video. Each skater's name is introduced while riding in the car which is then followed by footage of them performing a trick. The car then drives along a road until out of frame which then reveals a sunset overlooking a forest.\n\nGuy Mariano's name is displayed in white writing in front of a black background thus beginning his part. Then footage of Guy performing several tricks is shown before the accompanied song (\"I Want You Back\" by Jackson 5) starts playing. Guy Mariano continues to primarily skate in places such as schools, car parks and streets. His part ends with him sliding a rail and being in disbelief about it.\n\nJordan Richter's name is then displayed while the accompanying song (\"My War\" by Black Flag) starts playing. Jordan then proceeds to skate primarily half-pipes and vert-based skateparks (with some footage of him skating in car parks). His part ends abruptly after he performs a no handed air and the song ends.\n\nMark Gonzales' name is then displayed; then footage of the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is shown with Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) saying \"We are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams\". The accompanying song (\"Traneing In\" by John Coltrane) starts playing. Mark then proceeds to skate a wide variety of locations including car parks, streets, ditches, basketball courts, half pipes and plazas. Short and silent snippets of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory do appear throughout this part. The part ends when Mark frontside boardslides a rail and then loses his board. Then footage of a young British girl saying \"I hope you've enjoyed the skateboarding and everything else, that's all folks, goodbye. And this is from...\", she then gives a confused look to someone off camera.\n\nThen footage is shown of all five skaters riding in the Blue Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency interacting with various \"Support our troops\" protesters on the sidewalk. Jason Lee yells to the protesters the infamous line \"No War for Heavy Metal!\".\n\nRudy Johnson's name is displayed while the accompanying song (\"Just Like Heaven\" by Dinosaur Jr.) starts playing. Rudy then skates such locations as streets, car parks, plazas and Embarcadero (in San Francisco). Rudy's part ends abruptly as he performs an Ollie one foot to lipslide on a rail and almost runs into the camera.\n\nJason Lee's name is displayed before he addresses the camera and says \"You know I'll give you a hundred bucks and I'll take you out to Benihana's if you slide that 75 foot handrail\". He then pulls a face at the camera and says \"I'll give you 600 tries, I'll be back next week\". Then he proceeds to skate when the accompanying song (\"The Knife Song\" by Milk) comes on. He skates various car parks, plazas, streets, schools etc. in his part. About 3/4 of the way through his part the song changes to \"Real World\" by Hüsker Dü. Then a newspaper reading \"AMERICA GOES TO WAR: COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE GULF CRISIS\" is shown, then Jason Lee proceeds to sing a song that goes:\n\nHis part then fades to black.\n\nThen a voice is heard which says \"There's a liquor right there, dude, so pull over, it's a yellow sign\". Then \"Lowrider\" by War is played again as several shots of all 5 skaters drinking alcoholic beverages while riding in their signature Blue Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency. The car then drives onto a narrow dirt road where it slowly starts to lose control. The car then falls off the dirt road and rolls down a big hill where it then crashes into a pile of rocks.\n\nThe credits then roll, with each skater performing a trick in slow motion, with \"Cancion mixteca\" by Ry Cooder playing and with \"(birthdate-1991)\" under the name of each skater (except for Rudy Johnson which the number 1-900-810-3611 is displayed).\n\n\"Video Days\" has had a positive feedback from critics and is considered an important part in skateboarding history and culture.\n\nTrashfilter.com has praised Video Days stating that \" 'The best skate video of all time? Really?' When you take into a number of factors into account, then you soon realise that it's a deserving title. The story behind the first video from the Blind skateboard team back in 1991 is a much-fabled tale. But strip everything back to the raw skating within and it still holds its legendary status\".\n\n\"Thrasher\" has inducted 3 out of the 5 skateboarding parts (Jason Lee, Mark Gonzales and Guy Mariano) in Video Days into their \"classics\" video section. \"Thrasher\" has praised Video Days saying \"The Blind guys didn't set out to make skate history in 1991, and that makes this video's legendary status even better.\"\n\n\"Huck\" writer Jay Riggio both praised and described his history with Video Days stating \"The video was almost too much to take in. From the mind-blowing skating to the documented personalities of my heroes, absorbing it in small intervals was my only option. I can’t go as far as to say that I recognized the genius of Video Days off the bat, nor can I say that I even placed much importance on Spike Jonze’s onscreen credit back then – I had only recognized his name from photo credits in skate mags. All I knew was that Video Days made me want to skate like never before. There was magic in it that to this day seems difficult to place.\"\n\nSkimTheFat reviewer \"Thrashathon\" rated Video Days 5 stars (out of stars) stating \"Video Days has become a standard for skate videos for the last 10 years and will continue for the next 10. The street skating is amazing and still fires me up to this day. It features some of the all-time best skaters, and skating that is excellent even when compared with today's standards. Throughout the 360 flips, handrails, gaps, manual variations, and bluntslides, the eclectic soundtrack fully complements the video. I would highly recommend watching this video over all other videos.\"\n\nJason Lee's impromptu song at the end of his part caught the attention of \"Clerks\" director Kevin Smith, who would later cast Lee in Smith's follow-up film \"Mallrats\", thus launching Lee's acting career. \n\nAlthough the car crash at the end was not intended to be serious, at the time, many people thought the team had actually died..\n\n\nFor their February/March 2011 issue, \"Skateboarder Magazine\" organized a reunion photo shoot with all 5 skaters to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Video Days.\n\n\"Skateboarder Magazine\"'s photographer John Bradford quoted on skateboardermag.com \"To tell you the truth I was a little jealous of Jaime Owens when he told me he’d be shooting the Video Days guys for the article. He’s usually the one holding everything together down in the office while photographers like me and Mehring are out and about shooting what needs to be shot. Plus, I’m of an age where I grew up in the ’90′s (like Jaime), and can vividly remember the earth figuratively shaking when Video Days first dropped. I have a 2 decade old nervous tick of starting to whistle the John Coltrane song from Gonz’ part, which often reminds me of how many times I watched it before and after school, and on the weekends before I went skating… so I of course started drooling over the shoot when I first heard it was coming together. Anyway I digress. As the shoot happened I tagged along to be a fly on the wall (and to help out where I could) while these dudes all got together for the first time in many years to reminisce about how they innocently and unwhittingly (sic) changed skateboarding forever. My jealousy of Jaime instantly faded and the day became one of my favorite days of my career to date, just given who was in the room and what they were all collectively there to celebrate.\"\n\nA 3 part \"Behind the Scenes\" video series was then uploaded onto skateboardermag.com, one of which had an interview with Guy Mariano about the early days of Blind Skateboards and Video Days.\n\nThe soundtrack includes many types of music, including rock, jazz, pop and punk.\n\n(In order of appearance):\n\n"}

He served in the French Royal Navy during the American Revolutionary War and was one of the leaders of the Revolt in the Vendée against the revolutionary regime. His nephew Athanase-Charles-Marie Charette de la Contrie was a noted military leader and grandson of Charles X the last king of France.\n\nA nobleman born in Couffé, arrondissement of Ancenis, Charette served in the French Navy under Toussaint-Guillaume Picquet de la Motte, notably during the American War of Independence, and became \"lieutenant de vaisseau\". He notably served on the 74-gun \"Hercule\", under Puget-Bras.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the French Revolution, he quit the Navy in 1789 and emigrated to Koblenz (Trier) in 1792 (a common move for royalist aristocrats). He soon returned to France to live at his property in La Garnache, and became one of the royalist volunteers who assisted in defending King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette from physical harm during the mob attack on Tuileries Palace (the \"Journée du 10 août\"); arrested in Angers, he was released through the intervention of Charles François Dumouriez.\n\nIn 1793, the Revolt in the Vendée against the French First Republic broke out, and the peasant fighters asked Charette to be their leader. He joined Jacques Cathelineau following the taking of Saumur in June 1793 and fought in most of the battles of the Catholic and Royal Army. On 19 September 1793, he participated in the victorious Battle of Tiffauges. Afterwards he and Louis Marie de Lescure had marched on Saint-Fulgent to pursue Jean-Baptiste Kléber, who had escaped. Charette won another victory over the Republicans at the First Battle of Noirmoutier. Some of the captured soldiers took part in the Machecoul Massacres and a quarter of them were executed for retribution by Charette's troops, against his orders. After the parting of the Vendean leaders in September 1793, he and his men retreated. He became the leader of the Lower Vendée, and successfully used guerrilla warfare against the Republican troops, capturing a Republican camp in Saint-Christophe-du-Ligneron, near Challans, but ran out of supplies and was decisively attacked by the troops of Nicolas Haxo. Trapped in the , Charette, with the fellow leader Couëtus was informed of an escape route by a local to the isle. Leaving behind all guns, ammunition, horses, refugees and the wounded, Charette, Couëtus and their men swam through the marshes to Châteauneuf. By a chance stroke of luck, Charette met up with the army of Joly, and both him and Charette retaliated by circling Haxo, gaining back supplies and distracting the Republican army from the refugees.Haxo later attacked the Isle of Noirmoutier, with Louis Turreau, which had been taken by Charette the month before, and after promising life to the inhabitants if they surrendered, against Haxo's command Turreau killed most men, women and children on the isle at the steps of the local church (La chapelle de la Pitié), including D'Elbée who had taken refuge there after sustaining 14 wounds at the battle of Cholet.\n\nAfter this, Charette's army returned and collected reinforcements; Revolutionary brutality and the 'Infernal Columns' sent by the Convention to destroy the Vendée forced many peasants to join Charette's army for merely safety. Charette won a victory at Saint-Fulgent, only to be chased into hiding in the forest of Grala. He emerged from it to attack the 'Brouzils'; he was wounded in the arm but kept on until the end of the fight. After obtaining food for his starving army, Charette was brought to La Morière, a convent near Machecoul, to recover from his wound; he was only able to rest there for a few days when his location was betrayed and the Republicans surrounded the convent. Warned, he was able to escape, but the nuns and a large number of the refugees who had come with Charette's army and had hidden in the church were massacred.\nOn 17 February 1795, after being introduced to it by his sister, Charette signed the Treaty of La Jaunaye with the emissaries of the National Convention, which included freedom of religion guarantees and excluded the conscription of local peasants from the \"levée en masse\". The republicans soon reneged on the terms of the treaty, and their parole, repudiating the guarantees of religious freedom; and they began conscripting peasants once again. They also murdered thousands of royalist prisoners including the Bishop of Dol. Charette and his men returned to the fight again in July and moved to help the planned invasion at Quiberon by French royalist emigrés with assistance from the British Royal Navy.\n\nThe Count of Artois, the Bourbon successor to the throne of France, made him Lieutenant General and gave orders to prepare for a royal return which, however, did not eventuate. Charette remained loyal to the old dynasty and the Catholic religion, as did his men and most of the Vendean and Breton peasantry. He, and all the loyal royalists, later refused to join the liberal Orléanists. After the failure of the Quiberon expedition, Charette and his men were pursued by General Lazare Hoche. Charette was wounded but escaped. However, due to lack of munitions he was eventually captured outside La Chabotterie and taken to Nantes for a trial. He was sentenced to death by a republican court and then taken to the town square in procession for a public execution by firing squad. A plaque has been erected and still stands upon the place where he was shot. Today, memorial ceremonies continue to take place there.\n\nAccording to a contemporary writing in \"Walker's Hibernian Magazine\", it was Charette who said, by way of extenuating the number of deaths for which he was responsible, \"Omelets are not made without breaking eggs.\"\n\nCharette was described by Napoleon as a great character and military leader who \"betrays genius\".\n\nCharette is a character in the episode \"The Frogs and the Lobsters\" of the \"Hornblower\" film/television series. Charette is a royalist general in exile who, with the support of the British Royal Navy, attempts and fails to rally the surviving royalists and raise an army in France to restore the king to power. Unlike his real-life counterpart here he is slain in battle defending a captured fortification. He is also fluent in English in the television adaptation.\n\nCharette has been since 2018 the lead character and his life story is depicted in the production of \"Le Dernier Panache\" (“The Last Plume”), at the French theme park, Puy Du Fou.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2145315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145315", "title": "Cowpasture River", "text": "Cowpasture River\n\nThe Cowpasture River is a chief tributary of the James River in western Virginia in the United States. It is long.\n\nThe Cowpasture rises in northeastern Highland County and flows generally southwestwardly, initially between Bullpasture Mountain and Shaws Ridge through a narrow valley floor near the George Washington National Forest. It is joined in eastern Highland County by Shaws Fork and gains breadth but has little depth. At Summers Mountain (a high point along Bullpasture Mountain) the river passes through a narrow gorge before entering a broad valley in Bath County, where at the community of Williamsville it collects the Bullpasture River, which greatly adds to its volume. For from this confluence the Cowpasture is joined by many small streams, and flows in increasingly wide bends in eastern Bath County. Downstream of the community of Millboro Springs the river becomes deep enough for year-round boating; there are several boat launch sites along the river in Bath County. In eastern Alleghany County the Cowpasture is joined by Simpson Creek and shortly enters Botetourt County, where it joins the Jackson River to form the James River near the town of Iron Gate.\n\nThe Native Americans had named the river \"Walatoola\", which means \"winding waters\", describing the great bends in the river. However, when British settlers arrived in the 1720s they named it the Cowpasture.\n\nThere is an interesting story about how the Cowpasture and neighboring rivers the Bullpasture River and Calfpasture River came to be so named. It is said that the Shawnee once had stolen a herd of settlers' cattle and were driving them westward into the mountains. The calves naturally tired first; they were left behind at the river which is now the Calfpasture. The cows were driven on farther, but they, too, had to be abandoned, the valley in which they were left became the valley of the Cowpasture. The bulls, being somewhat hardier, were still able to continue westward; they finally were left at the river which is known as the Bullpasture.\n\nThe Cowpasture flows through valley and ridge topography of shale, limestone, and sandstone. Because of the limestone there are a great number of sinkholes and caves. During extended dry periods the upper courses of the river will entirely dry up and only flow beneath the river bed through the limestone caves.\n\nBecause the Cowpasture is bordered by George Washington National Forest, Highland Wildlife Management Area, and several Wilderness Areas, there is an abundance of wildlife. There are many bald eagles which nest along the river, and there are also river otters, which have been reintroduced. With the abundance of wildlife there are also many hunt camps along the river.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2145318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145318", "title": "Shining Force III", "text": "Shining Force III\n\nIn North America and Europe, only the first volume was released.\n\nLike earlier \"Force\" games in the \"Shining\" series, \"Shining Force III\" is a turn-based tactical role-playing game. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, do not count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.\n\nAs is typical for an RPG, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels.\n\nEach character has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A character can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.\n\nBattle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader (Synbios in Scenario 1, Prince Medion in Scenario 2 and Julian in Scenario 3), or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Return. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although the leader's death results in the player losing half of their money.\n\n\"Shining Force III\" also possesses an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese-style traditional RPG, along the lines of \"Final Fantasy\" or \"Dragon Quest\", although there are no labyrinths and few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player's army is represented by its leader, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army and choose which of the army's members will be used in battle.\n\nScenario 1 features Synbios, a young lord from the Republic of Aspinia. Aspinia was once a part of the Empire of Destonia, but seceded after a war of independence spearheaded by some of the more democratic-minded nobles. They opposed Emperor Domaric's totalitarian policies, which disenfranchised a large number of people, creating a huge disparity between the wealthy and the poor. Tensions remained between Aspinia and Destonia after the secession, marked by occasional border disputes.\n\nAs the game begins, Synbios is part of a military force representing Aspinia at a peace conference in the neutral city of Saraband. Due to manipulation by outside forces - later discovered to be connected with a religious cult known as the \"Bulzome Sect\" - full-scale war breaks out again between Aspinia and Destonia. The majority of the game's storyline covers this conflict as well as Synbios and his team's fight against the Bulzome sect. Throughout the game Synbios has periodic encounters with Medion, Destonia's youngest prince, who also recognizes the truth behind the war. Although on opposite sides of the war, the two work together to identify the real threat. Medion's role is portrayed in more detail in Scenario 2.\n\nScenario 2 features Medion, Prince of Destonia, and youngest of three sons of Emperor Domaric. Although loyal to his father and his country, he senses that there are other forces at work beneath the tensions between Aspinia and Destonia. He attends the conference in Saraband on behalf of Destonia, along with his brothers Arrawnt and Mageron. As discovered in Scenario 1, much of this influence comes from the Bulzome sect, as well as collaborating separatist factions within both Destonia and Aspinia. Medion works parallel to Synbios of Aspinia, often disposing of rogue Aspinian elements to spare Synbios's force from fighting against its own countrymen. At the end of the game, Medion is forced to battle with Synbios' force when Julian steps in to stop them.\n\nScenario 3 stars Julian, a mercenary who appears as a secondary character in both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. He is for all intents and purposes the true main character of Shining Force III. His initial motivation as the story begins is to track down and kill Galm, one of, if not the, most powerful member of the Vandals, a powerful race of beings that existed over 1,000 years ago. Julian believes that Galm killed his father and is seeking revenge. This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father.\n\nJulian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2, apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion. As it becomes clear that the sect is trying to kill Gracia, a child intended to become the next Innovator (A Shining Series figure equatable to a god), Julian takes on the task of protecting him and helping him realize his destiny.\n\nScenario 3 starts about 60% through scenario 2's story, and focuses primarily on battles against the Bulzome Sect and their allies in both Aspinia and Destonia. While scenarios 1 & 2 happen at roughly the same time, much of scenario 3 takes place after both, but there is some \"overlap\". Eventually Julian leads a three-party coalition consisting of the armies of both Synbios and Medion, to engage in the final conflict against Bulzome, a powerful Vandal long sealed in another dimension, and the true orchestrator of the conflict.\n\nThe game was announced in September 1997.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Saturn version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"it's a worthy upgrade to a game series that's already proven itself.\"\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Saturn version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"Like Saturn itself, \"Shining Force III\" will end up being an effort that was underproduced, underrated, but fun as hell.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2145324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145324", "title": "Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America", "text": "Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America\n\nThe uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) gives a Scout visibility and creates a level of identity within both the unit and the community. The uniform is used to promote equality while showing individual achievement. While all uniforms are similar in basic design, they do vary in color and detail to identify the different membership divisions of Cub Scouting, Scouts BSA and Venturing. Many people collect BSA insignia such as camporee and jamboree emblems, council shoulder strips and historical badges.\n\nEarly Boy Scout uniforms were copies of the U.S. Army uniforms of the time. Scouts generally wore knickers with leggings, a button-down choke-collar coat and the campaign hat. Adults wore a Norfolk jacket with knickers or trousers. In 1916, Congress banned civilians from wearing uniforms that were similar in appearance to those of the U.S. armed forces with the exception of the BSA. The uniform was redesigned in 1923—the coat and leggings were dropped and the neckerchief standardized. In the 1930s, shorts replaced knickers and their wear was encouraged by the BSA. The garrison (flat) cap was introduced in 1943. In 1965, the uniform's material was changed from wool and cotton to permanent press cloth, although the older material uniforms continued to be sold and used through the late 1960s. The Improved Scouting Program in 1972 included a major overhaul of badges and other insignia, replacing many two color patches with multicolor versions. Also introduced was a red beret and a dark green shirt for \"Leadership Corps\" members (ages 14–15) in a Scout troop. This was done to relate those older Boy Scouts to Explorers, which wore the same uniform shirt, but by the early 1980s, the red beret and the Leadership Corps concept had been discarded. \n\nThe Boy Scout uniform during the 1950s–1970s continued to have a monochrome light green (khaki-green) color for both shirts and shorts or trousers.\n\nIn 1980, a major change was made when a two-color uniform having a tan shirt with olive green shorts or trousers was introduced. Designed by Oscar de la Renta, it continued to be the uniform until August 2008, when the \"Centennial Scout Uniform\" was unveiled. The Oscar de la Renta-designed tan buttoned-front uniform shirt had shoulder epaulets and buttoned-down pocket flaps, worn with an olive green webbed belt with a brass buckle or a tan or brown-leather belt. The olive green cap had a bright red front panel and gold fleur-de-lis. In 2006, olive-green \"Switchback\" zip-off trousers were introduced in place of the traditional trousers, having an integral belt assembly with provisions for either the olive green webbed or brown-leather belt. Socks were olive green with a red band at the top and came in crew or ankle lengths, or knee length for wear with shorts. Female leaders were provided a choice of slacks, shorts, culottes, or a skirt.\n\nExplorers in the 1950s–1970s had a uniform of spruce green shirt and trousers, but by the 1970s many posts were developing their own uniform. Eventually only the shirt was available, leading many to wear the shirt with olive green Boy Scout pants or shorts. When Exploring was moved to Learning for Life in 1998, the new Venturing division used the spruce green shirt with charcoal gray pants.\n\nThe uniform had, for some years, been referred to as the \"field uniform\", but the BSA now uses the terms \"official Boy Scout uniform\", \"official Venturing uniform\" and the like. With the introduction of the Switchbacks zip-off pants, the trend is towards a uniform emphasizing comfort and utility.\n\nThe official policy of the BSA is that any uniform or uniform part which has ever been approved for use, is still acceptable. As example, there are some Troops who choose to distinguish themselves by wearing the red berets from the 1970s; or the earlier \"garrison\" or \"flat\" hat; or even wear the original army-style uniforms.\n\nThe uniform and insignia are variously protected by copyright, trademark, and congressional charter. The BSA does allow usage for movies, television shows and other events, but this is done on a case by case basis. The BSA has rebuked instances where it was felt that the uniform was used inappropriately and without permission. BSA rules and regulations also forbid the use of Scouting emblems for commercial or political purposes. Wear of the uniform and insignia is described in the various handbooks, the \"Insignia Guide\" and inspection sheets.\n\nOfficial uniform shirts and blouses are of the button-up style with a pointed collar, two front button-flap pockets, and long or short sleeves. Since 2007, all shirts come with a U.S. flag attached to the right shoulder and a BSA program strip above the right pocket.\n\nThe yellow, tan and dark green shirts have shoulder straps (often referred to as epaulets) and colored shoulder loops (often called tabs) are worn on the straps to indicate the program level. Webelos Scouts wearing tan uniforms and all Cub Scout leaders wear blue loops, Boy Scouts and leaders wear forest green loops (changed from red in 2008), Varsity Scouts and leaders wear blaze (orange) loops, and Venturers and leaders wear emerald green loops. Adults or youth who hold a district, council, or section position wear silver loops; those with area, regional, or national positions wear gold loops. Blue, red, forest green or blaze loops may not be worn on the green Venturing shirt and emerald green loops may not be worn on the tan shirt. Custom loops are not authorized.\n\nA wide variety of insignia in the form of cloth patches and metallic pins are worn on the uniform. In general, patches that represent a position of responsibility or an award of merit are referred to as badges and all others are emblems. Other insignia is in the form of medals, ribbons and pins.\n\nInsignia such as merit badge sashes, medals, and pins are generally only worn on formal occasions such as courts of honor, award banquets, or as part of an honor guard.\n\nEvery BSA unit is entitled to a flag, with a specific design for each type of unit. Flags are split with a top half in one color and the bottom in another and the program emblem in the center. The upper half has lettering for the unit type and number and the chartering organization; the bottom has lettering for the community and council. Cub Scouting pack flags have a gold top half with blue lettering and blue bottom half with gold lettering. Boy Scouting troop flags are red with white lettering over white with red lettering; Varsity Scouting team flags are orange over white with yellow lettering on both halves. Venturing crew flags are white over gold with green lettering; Sea Scouting ship flags are red over blue with white lettering.\n\nDens within a Cub Scouting pack have a small flag with the Cub Scouting or Webelos Scouting emblem on blue or the Tiger Cub Scouting emblem on orange and the den number. Patrols within a Boy Scouting troop may create a flag based on the patrol name. The Sea Scout leader flag is red over blue with the Sea Scouting emblem centered and white rating stars: one star for a ship, two stars for a council, three stars for a region and four stars for national.\n\nLocal council flags are blue with gold lettering and the Boy Scout emblem; regions have purple flags with silver lettering. The flag of the National Council is purple with a silver emblem and no lettering.\n\nMedals and the like are not generally worn on the uniform for everyday use; instead, square knot insignia are worn to represent some national and local Council awards. These insignia pieces are small cloth patches with an embroidered square knot or other emblem that represents the actual award. The colors of the knot, the patch background and the patch border indicates the represented award. For the most part, the colors of the knot emblem are taken from the ribbon or design of the actual award. The knot is NOT the award, but rather an optional representation and recognition that the individual has received or earned a specific award.\n\nAlthough they do not use a square knot insignia, the District Award of Merit and the Silver World Award award insignia are still referred to as \"square knots\". The District Award of Merit and the Professional Training Award do not have a wearable insignia item other than the square knot.\n\nThe vast majority of \"square knot\" insignia represents one instance of an individual's recognition. There are a few awards which may be earned or received multiple times (such as the Scouters' Training Award, adult religious service awards, youth religious awards, etc.) within different program. For instance, a youth member may be able to earn religious emblems as a Cub Scout, WEBELOS Cub Scout, Boy Scout and Venturer or Sea Scout. Small metal pin-on devices may be worn to show the membership division or the level at which an award was presented if earned more than once. The devices are designed to be worn on the medal's ribbon (if the award has a ribbon) as well as on the cloth square knot insignia. For example, the Scouter's Training Award may be awarded as the Cub Scout Leader's Training Award, the Boy Scout Leader's Training Award, the Varsity Scout Leader's Training Award, the Venturing Leader's Training Award, the Sea Scout Leader's Training Award, The Unit Committee Training Award and the Roundtable Staff Training Award; the appropriate device may be worn to show the division in which the award was earned. Multiple devices may be worn if the award was earned at multiple levels.\n\nAdult Eagle Scouts who met additional requirements toward a Palm to the Eagle Scout Award, may wear the highest combination of Palms earned on either the regular Eagle Scout square knot emblem or a special square knot emblem signifying their life membership as a part of the National Eagle Scout Association. This display is to not exceed six Silver Palms and a Gold Palm representing 100 merit badges earned over the 21 required to earn the Eagle Scout rank.\n\nNo more than seven devices may be placed on any one square knot emblem.\n\nWith the inclusion of girls in the Boy Scout (renamed to Scouts BSA) program, starting February 1, 2019 a new tan uniform shirt has been approved and is available for purchase. The new tan shirt features a red Fleur de lis symbol and red 'BSA' text in place of the 'Boy Scouts of America' text. Also available as an option for boys and girls are new olive green capris uniform pants. The previous official Boy Scout uniform, known as the \"Centennial Scout Uniform\", was named in tribute to the organization's 100th anniversary in 2010. The uniform may be worn by adult leaders, Scouts, and Webelos Scouts. Introduced on August 15, 2008, to have a more outdoors-activity oriented appearance, the Centennial Scout Uniform transitionally replaced the previous version designed by Oscar de la Renta. The BSA declared this uniform \"transitional,\" meaning that those possessing the de la Renta uniform may not only still wear it (as is the case with any previously-authorized uniforms) but that they may interchange parts with the new uniform as well (mainly to solve issues with shirt and pants which were not ready for wide-scale manufacturing at the time). The uniform \"transitional\" status ended in 2011. Except as clearance items however, Council and BSA stores will no longer sell the de la Renta uniform.\n\nThere were two versions of the Centennial shirt. The first version was a khaki (officially referred by BSA as tan) button-front shirt with collar, bellowed pockets on the chest and featured a special \"technology pocket\" on the left shoulder. This was designed to allow Scouts and Scouters to place their personal cell phone or media player in that pocket. A hole at the bottom of the pocket allowed an earpiece to be to connected to the item. Many Scouters referred to the pocket as the \"cigarette pocket\" for its size and lack of real usability. The BSA redesigned the shirt, removing the pocket.\n\nThe current version of the Centennial shirt is a khaki (officially referred by BSA as tan) button-front shirt with collar, bellowed pockets on the chest and closed with hook-and-loop closures, and shoulder epaulets with shoulder loops in the color of the individual's registration (see above). All adults and youth males wear forest green or khaki convertible or Switchback zip-off cargo pants, which easily convert to knee-length cargo shorts with the pull of a zipper. Socks, worn with the uniform, are also forest green and have a black \"B.S.A.\" monogrammed at the top and are available in crew and ankle lengths. The new official belt is a forest green rigger style belt with a black metal mechanical claw buckle – other belt styles, mostly in tan or brown leather, are also worn, while the hat, resembling the U.S. Army's baseball-style fatigue hat worn during the Vietnam War-era, is also in forest green with the B.S.A. emblem embroidered in the front in a ghost stitching.\n\nAs with the older Oscar de la Renta-designed uniform of 1980–2008, Boy Scout Troops and Varsity Scout Teams vote to select uniform options for the belt, hat, and neckwear. In place of either the new \"Centennial\" or older \"de la Renta\" baseball caps, units may choose to wear various headgear options: the iconic campaign hat (colloquially called the \"Smokey Bear\" hat, which hearkens back to Scouting's inception in 1907), a hat styled like the hat worn by \"Indiana Jones\", a red beret, a garrison (flat) cap, or a baseball-style cap of the unit's own design. The beret and garrison cap are now rarely seen as neither hat has been manufactured for more than 20 years. Neckwear on both uniforms includes the neckerchief and the bolo tie as selected by the unit. A variety of official neckerchiefs are available or the troop can create their own design. Many troops now opt not to wear neckwear. Special neckerchiefs such as Eagle Scout or Wood Badge are generally worn on formal occasions.\n\nOlder, all-olive green uniforms from the 1970s and earlier may still be worn by Scouters who possess them, although parts may not be worn interchangeably with the current Centennial Scout Uniform or the de la Renta-designed uniforms. They are prized by Scouting memorabilia collectors from around the country.\n\nThe official Cub Scout uniform is worn by youths in Cub Scouting. The basic Cub Scout uniform consists of a navy blue shirt, navy blue pants, shorts or Switchbacks, navy blue socks with gold tops for Cub Scouts or orange tops for Tiger Cub Scouts, a navy blue web belt with brass buckle with Cub Scout logo, a neckerchief with slide, and a navy blue cap with a colored panel. The shirt has buttons, a pointed collar, two front button-flap pockets, and short or long sleeves. Lion Cub Scouts wear a unique blue T-shirt with large Lion rank image and 'LION' text. The insignia on the cap, neckerchief, neckerchief slide and belt buckle vary by section: Lion, Tiger, Wolf, Bear, and Webelos Scouts. The Cub Scout uniform originally was deliberately designed to emulate the uniform colors and design of the United States Cavalry of the 1800s.\n\nFemale leaders in Cub Scouting have the option of wearing the classic yellow blouse with navy blue pants, shorts, skirt or culottes instead of the Scouts BSA tan uniform. The yellow blouse, though, is less common since it has been discontinued for years. (Still available online at https://www.scoutshop.org/cub-scout-leader-ladies-short-sleeve-uniform-blouse-yellow-609314.html )\n\nEach Venturing crew votes on the desired uniform; they may use either the official Venturing uniform or may develop their own. Other than emblems, crew developed uniforms may not use elements of other BSA uniforms and must meet other uniform standards, such as not resembling military uniforms. Venturers may not wear the Boy Scout uniform.\n\nThe official Venturing uniform consists of the spruce green button-up shirt available only in short sleeves, charcoal gray shorts or trousers, gray socks with Venturing logo and the gray web belt with brass buckle and Venturing logo or the black riggers style belt with Venturing logo.\n\nOriginal hats were the gray baseball cap or the gray bushman hat with snap-up brim, both with Venturing logos. These were replaced by the Venturing ultra-shield uniform cap in gray with a removable fabric shield.\n\nVenturers may develop a unique crew emblem that, with approval from the Scout executive, may be worn on the right sleeve of the uniform.\n\nA male Venturer who earned rank as a Boy Scout may wear the rank emblem centered on the left pocket. Venturers who earned rank as a Venturer wear this rank emblem centered on the left pocket.\n\nThe Official Sea Scout Uniform is designed to make it easy for members to outfit\nthemselves in a Sea Scout uniform. This universal uniform is worn by all youth and\nadult Ship members and serves as both a dress uniform and a work uniform. More\ndetails can be found in the Sea Scout Manual.\nSea Scout Uniform Components\n• Navy Blue ball cap, No. 618623; with SEA SCOUTS and the Sea\nScout logo embroidered in white.\n• Dark Navy Blue shirt; similar to Dickies Nos. 1574DN (male) and\nFS574DN (female), color DN, dark navy.\n• Dark Navy Blue t-shirt.\n• Dark Navy Blue pants; similar to Dickies Nos. 874DN (male)\nand 774DN (female), color DN, dark navy.\n• Black web belt and buckle with Sea Scout logo, No. 618624.\n• Black plain-toe shoes and black socks. Or, activity footwear such as\nboat shoes, hiking boots, or athletic shoes.\n• Optional Neckerchiefs (unit option)\nYouth and Adults may wear No.618625; black triangular design (unit\noption).\nThe \"tar flap\" design, No. 618626, is reserved for youth only (unit\noption)\n\nThe Scouter dress uniform is appropriate for professional Scouters and all Scouting leaders on formal occasions. The current version consists of a dark-blue, two-button blazer with white shirt or blouse and heather gray trousers, slacks or a skirt. The blazer's gold-plated buttons bear the universal emblem and an embroidered Cub Scout, Boy Scout or Venturing emblem is worn on the left pocket or lapel. A black leather belt with gold buckle is to be worn with trousers or slacks. Silk neckties with red, gold, and navy stripes are available for men and women. Black dress shoes and black socks or stockings are worn with the dress uniform. Older versions of neckwear representing Cub Scouting (gold and blue striped necktie), Boy Scouting (silver and red striped necktie), Exploring (blue and red striped necktie), or all programs (silver, red and blue striped necktie) may also be worn with this uniform. A small lapel pin representing an adult recognition may be worn on the left lapel; a small lapel pin representing Wood Badge or the Sea Badge may be worn on the right lapel. During formal events or recognition ceremonies, up to five pendant-type awards may be suspended from the neck by the individual. The actual Wood Badge is NOT worn with this uniform; a lapel pin may be worn instead.\n\nDuring the Wood Badge course Scouters, both staff and participants, wear the uniform of their unit and membership division; this is a change from the older custom where the uniform was worn without insignia other than the council shoulder patch and the Troop 1 numeral. The uniform is worn with the Wood Badge training hat, the neckerchief and with a woggle made during the opening sessions of the course. The hat and neckerchief use the Troop 1 numeral to represent the first troop to use the Wood Badge program. The axe-in-log is the emblem of Gilwell Park where the first Wood Badge course was held and the Maclaren tartan honors William de Bois Maclaren, who donated the funding to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919. After completing Wood Badge, the beads, neckerchief and woggle are presented and worn.\nVarious insignia are worn by Scouts and Scouters representing unit membership, activities, accomplishments, honors and training.\n\nThe council shoulder patch (known as the CSP) is an arc-shaped patch worn at the top of the sleeve that identifies the local council. Below this, Scouts at the unit level wear a unit number and units with veteran status may wear a veteran unit bar above the numbers. Lone Cub Scouts and Lone Scouts wear the Lone Scout emblem in place of the unit numeral. On the new (2008) style official shirt, the badge of office is centered on the pocket, but on the older official uniform shirts, the badge of office is centered and touching the bottom of the unit numeral, or centered 4 inches below the shoulder seam. When earned for the current position, the green lettering Trained leader strip is centered at the top of the pocket flap on the new style official shirt, but on the older official uniform shirts, the red lettering Trained leader strip is centered immediately below and touching the badge of office. Qualified commissioners may wear the Commissioner Arrowhead Honor in the bottom-most position (or if wearing the first version of the \"Centennial\" shirt, immediately below the Council Shoulder Strip in the location where a unit number would be worn). Youth who are serving as a Den Chief may wear a Den Chief cord around the left shoulder and under the shoulder strap instead of the emblem. Den Chiefs who earn the Den Chief Service Award may wear the service award cord in addition to the den chief cord, and may continue to wear it for as long as they are a youth.\n\nOfficial uniforms come with the US flag sewn to the top of the sleeve. Wearing the flag is optional—Scouts whose religion, tradition, or personal beliefs prevent them from displaying the flag are not required to do so. Below the flag, Cub Scouts (including Webelos) may wear a den number and Boy Scouts and Webelos Scouts (as an option) may wear a patrol emblem. In the next position, Scouts and Scouters may wear the most recent Quality Unit emblem earned by their unit. District or council level Scouters may wear the most recently earned Quality District or Quality Council patch. Venturers may wear the official Venturing emblem or an approved specialty emblem below the flag. Scouts and Scouters at the area or regional level may wear a region emblem below the flag.\n\nOther items that may be worn on the right sleeve include the Musician badge and National Honor Patrol stars. Boy Scouts and Varsity Scouts wearing a long-sleeve shirt may also wear up to six merit badges in two columns of three near the cuff.\n\nThe space on the left pocket is reserved to indicate Scout rank. Rank badges that may be worn by Cub Scouts include Bobcat, Tiger, Wolf, and Bear. Webelos Scouts wear the oval rank badge when earned. Scouts in any membership division who have earned the Arrow of Light badge wear it centered below the pocket. Boy Scouts and Varsity Scouts wear their current rank badge centered on the left pocket. Male Venturers may also wear their current Boy Scout rank cloth badge on the official Venturing uniform shirt to age 18.\n\nScouts and Scouters may wear up to five pin-on medals that they have earned or have been awarded centered just above the pocket seam; medals are usually only worn on formal occasions. Many medals may also be represented by a square knot insignia.\n\nSquare knots are rectangular cloth patches that use a multi-colored knot and/or border design to informally represent certain awards. Some emblems use other designs, such as the overhand knot for the District Award of Merit, but they are all referred to as \"square knots\". Some awards are represented by both medals or badges and square knots; others certificates or plaques and square knots; while other awards or recognitions have a certificate and a small device to wear atop a square knot emblem. Only a few square knots may be worn by youth, among them the Hornaday conservation award, the religious emblem or life-saving awards.\n\nScouters that have completed the Powder Horn course wear their silver metallic emblem suspended from the left pocket button.\n\nService stars may be worn above the pocket or top row of square knots. These are star shaped pins with an enameled number representing tenure in each Scouting division. Circular plastic backings represent each membership division: gold is used for Cub Scouting, green is used for Boy Scouting, brown used is for Varsity Scouting, red is used for Venturing and blue indicates adult service. Scouts and leaders with tenure as Tiger Cubs prior to 2000 may wear a service star with an orange backing. Those who served in Exploring prior to 1998 may wear a service star with red backing.\n\nAll Scouts and Scouters wear the round World Crest over the left pocket. This emblem is found on the uniform of most other Scouting organizations and represents unity with other Scouts around the world. Beginning with January 1, 2010, the Boy Scout 100th Anniversary ring may be worn on the outside of the World Crest.\n\nThe space on the right pocket is reserved for one temporary insignia, such as patches from summer camps or other activities, which should be centered on the pocket. Only one such item is worn centered on the pocket. Members of the Order of the Arrow may wear lodge insignia on the flap of the right pocket.\n\nOfficial uniforms have a BSA strip immediately above the right pocket, with the adult uniforms and youth male uniforms displaying the text \"Boy Scouts of America\", and the youth female uniforms displaying a fleur-de-lis logo and the text \"BSA\" in larger typeface. There are several insignia that can be placed above the BSA strip, including interpreter strips indicating foreign languages spoken. Boy Scouts over the age of 14 in a Troop's Venture patrol may wear the corresponding strip above the interpreter strip. If worn, a name tag may be placed just above the BSA program strip, interpreter and Venture strips (if worn) or on the flap of the right pocket if no lodge insignia is used. Scouts or Scouters that have participated or have been selected to attend a National or World Jamboree may wear the corresponding patch centered between the right pocket and the shoulder seam. Order of the Arrow members selected to attend the Centennial Order of the Arrow National Conference in 2015 may wear the official Conference emblem in this location as an exception.\n\nVisitors to all such events may wear patches for those events as a temporary insignia, centered on the right pocket.\n\nFemale Cub Scout leaders may wear the temporary insignia centered between the BSA strip and the shoulder seam.\n\nBoy Scouts and Varsity Scouts may wear the merit badge sash, generally on formal occasions. Merit badges may be worn on the front of the sash and the Varsity Letter with earned pins and bars may be worn on the bottom front corner. Additional merit badges and temporary insignia may be worn on the back of the sash. The sash is worn over the right shoulder and should never be worn folded through the belt, should not be worn at the same time as the Order of the Arrow sash, and should never be worn buttoned under the shoulder loop strap.\n\nA number of emblems are awarded that are not intended for wear on the uniform. The emblems for aquatics qualifications such as Boardsailing BSA, Kayaking BSA, Mile Swim BSA, Scuba BSA, and Snorkeling BSA are intended for wear on the left side of swimwear, while certification such as BSA Lifeguard and BSA Aquatics Instructor are worn on the right side. Other awards such as the 50-Miler Award, Historic Trails Award, Paul Bunyan Woodsman and the Totin' Chip and Firem'n Chit emblems are intended as equipment decoration such as a backpack or on a blanket.\n\nNon-official patches, badges, emblems, shoulder loops and other insignia are readily available from third-party suppliers. These spoofs are parodies of existing emblems. For example, spoof versions of the \"Trained\" emblem include Over Trained, Potty Trained and Untrainable. Common spoof interpreter strips include English, Klingon, Brooklyneese and Southern Drawl, and spoof epaulets include a red, white and blue one for Eagle Scouts and a tiger paw for Tiger Cubs.\n\nProperly, the uniform is referred to as the official field uniform. An activity or utility uniform generally consists of a Scouting related T-shirt, polo shirt or other shirt, often customized with a unit design. Activity or utility uniforms are worn when the official field uniform is not appropriate for activities or as directed by the unit leaders.\n\nMembers sometimes casually refer to these classifications as class A and class B, respectively. Such terminology is not used in any official BSA publications, where the terms \"official uniform\" and \"activity uniform\" are used.\n\n"}

It was founded in the late 11th century by the Anglo-Norman de Barry family. The castle was part of a mesne lordship under the control of the medieval Earls of Pembroke.\n\nManorbier is a rectangular enclosure castle that has curtain walls and round and square towers. It stands on a natural coastal promontory and has no external moat. The main entrance to the inner ward is a tower gateway that was defended by a portcullis, roof embrasures and a heavy iron/wood door. A postern gate provided access to the beach and the sea. The southeast tower is round; the northeast is angular. The castle's domestic ranges, which were completed in the 1140s, included kitchens, apartments and a Great hall. Windows replaced the arrowslits in the domestic range. A chapel with elaborate vaulting and plaster-work was built . Some of the original medieval frescoes survive.\n\nEarthworks completed an outer ward. There was no barbican. A bridge across a neck ditch linked the inner and outer wards.\n\nThe land was granted to Odo de Barri, a Norman knight, at the end of the 11th century. Initially, he constructed a motte-and-bailey castle on the site which had a wooden keep defended by a palisade and earthworks embankments. In the early part of the 12th century, William de Barri, Odo's son, used locally-quarried Limestone to strengthen the fortification.\n\nIn 1146 Gerald of Wales, the great 12th-century scholar known as \"Geraldus Cambrensis\" was born at the castle. He was the fourth and youngest son of William de Barri, who was related on his mother's side, to the legendary Welsh princess Nest ferch Rhys. Gerald wrote of his birthplace:\n\nIn all the broad lands of Wales, Manorbier is the most pleasant place by far.\n\nIn the castle's history, it was only attacked twice; both were minor skirmishes. In 1327, Richard de Barri assaulted Manorbier in a dispute over family succession. Then 300 years later during the English Civil War, the castle was seized in 1645 by Parliamentarian forces. It was then slighted to prevent further military use by the Royalists.\n\nThrough the 17th and 18th centuries, Manorbier fell into decay. However, in 1880 the castle was partially restored by J.R.Cobb, a tenant who carried out repairs to the buildings and walls.\n\nThe castle is privately owned and is open to the public together with the gardens, the dovecote and the mill. The castle is a wedding venue. A part has been converted into a holiday cottage.\n\nThe castle was used as Cair Paravel and The White Witch Castle by the BBC in an adaption of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", and would later be used in \"Dragonworld\".\n\nThe 2003 film \"I Capture the Castle\" was shot largely on location at the castle.\n\nAn episode of the 1960s television series 'Dangerman' ('Secret Agent' in the US), \"The Conspirators\", was partly shot at the castle.\n\n"}
{"id": "2145345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145345", "title": "Ganglia (software)", "text": "Ganglia (software)\n\nGanglia is a scalable, distributed monitoring tool for high-performance computing systems, clusters and networks. The software is used to view either live or recorded statistics covering metrics such as CPU load averages or network utilization for many nodes.\n\nGanglia software is bundled with enterprise-level Linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Level (RHEL) or the CentOS repackaging of the same. Ganglia grew out of requirements for monitoring systems by Berkeley (University of California) but now sees use by commercial and educational organisations such as Cray, MIT, NASA and Twitter.\n\nIt is based on a hierarchical design targeted at federations of clusters. It relies on a multicast-based listen/announce protocol to monitor state within clusters and uses a tree of point-to-point connections amongst representative cluster nodes to federate clusters and aggregate their state. It leverages widely used technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures, and is currently in use on over 500 clusters around the world. It has been used to link clusters across university campuses and around the world and can scale to handle clusters with 2000 nodes.\n\nThe ganglia system comprises two unique daemons, a PHP-based web front-end, and a few other small utility programs.\n\n\"Gmond\" is a multi-threaded daemon which runs on each cluster node you want to monitor. Installation does not require having a common NFS filesystem or a database back-end, installing special accounts or maintaining configuration files.\n\nGmond has four main responsibilities:\nEach gmond transmits information in two different ways:\n\nFederation in Ganglia is achieved using a tree of point-to-point connections amongst representative cluster nodes to aggregate the state of multiple clusters. At each node in the tree, a Ganglia Meta Daemon (gmetad) periodically polls a collection of child data sources, parses the collected XML, saves all numeric, volatile metrics to round-robin databases and exports the aggregated XML over a TCP socket to clients. Data sources may be either gmond daemons, representing specific clusters, or other gmetad daemons, representing sets of clusters. Data sources use source IP addresses for access control and can be specified using multiple IP addresses for failover. The latter capability is natural for aggregating data from clusters since each gmond daemon contains the entire state of its cluster.\n\nThe Ganglia web front-end provides a view of the gathered information via real-time dynamic web pages. Most importantly, it displays Ganglia data in a meaningful way for system administrators and computer users. Although the web front-end to ganglia started as a simple HTML view of the XML tree, it has evolved into a system that keeps a colorful history of all collected data.\n\nThe Ganglia web front-end caters to system administrators and users. For example, one can view the CPU utilization over the past hour, day, week, month, or year. The web front-end shows similar graphs for memory usage, disk usage, network statistics, number of running processes, and all other Ganglia metrics.\n\nThe web front-end depends on the existence of the gmetad which provides it with data from several Ganglia sources. Specifically, the web front-end will open the local port 8651 (by default) and expects to receive a Ganglia XML tree. The web pages themselves are highly dynamic; any change to the Ganglia data appears immediately on the site. This behavior leads to a very responsive site, but requires that the full XML tree be parsed on every page access. Therefore, the Ganglia web front-end should run on a fairly powerful, dedicated machine if it presents a large amount of data.\n\nThe Ganglia web front-end is written in PHP, and uses graphs generated by gmetad to display history information. It has been tested on many flavours of Unix (primarily Linux) with the Apache webserver and the PHP5 module.\n\n"}

{"id": "2145363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145363", "title": "Bull Lake glaciation", "text": "Bull Lake glaciation\n\nThe Bull Lake glaciation is the name of a glacial period in North America that is part of the Quaternary Ice Age. The Bull Lake glaciation began about 200,000 years ago and ended about 130,000 years ago, and was concurrent with the Illinoian Stage of the Quaternary Ice Age. There is disagreement over these time frames, however, and further research is necessary.\n\nThis glacial period was identified by geologist Eliot Blackwelder. The glacial period draws its name from Bull Lake in Wyoming in the United States, where well-preserved moraines from this glacial period were first described. Although Blackwelder originally believed the Bull Lake glaciation occurred during the early Wisconsin Glaciation (the last major advance of glaciers in the North America), new data generated and described by geologist Gerald M. Richmond in the 1940s and 1960s more accurately dated the glacial period to the Illinoian Stage.\n\nThe Bull Lake glaciation was a local glaciation. It did not cover the entire North American continent but rather just the eastern slopes of the southern Rocky Mountains. Generally speaking, it extended from northwestern Montana south to the San Juan Mountains in Colorado. The Bull Lake glaciation has three periods—Early, Middle and Late—punctuated by periods of relative warmth (during which glaciers retreated).\n\nThe Bull Lake glaciation is generally considered to be much less extensive than the preceding glaciations. However, the reach of the glaciers varied from place to place, extending further in some areas than others. Bull Lake moraines remain relatively undisturbed, indicating that glacial periods which came later were only about 90 percent as extensive as the Bull Lake glaciation.\n\nThe Bull Lake Glaciation was followed by a warm interglacial period that lasted about 60,000 years. The Pinedale Glaciation, another local glacial period, occurred after this warm period.\n"}

It powered the A-6 Intruder and the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. the engine was still in use in models of the A-4 Skyhawk and the EA-6B Prowler. \n\nThe engine is the basis for the Pratt & Whitney JT8D, a popular civilian low-bypass turbofan engine.\n\nThe J52 was developed in the mid-1950s for the US Navy as a scaled-down derivative of the J57/JT3A. It was initially intended to power the A4D-3 Skyhawk, an advanced avionics model that was canceled in 1957. After being canceled, the U.S. Air Force selected the J52 to power the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. The engine was designed with several unique features for this application, including a \"conical centerbody mounted in the intake\" and a \"variable central plug ... in the nozzle\". Then, in 1958, the US Navy selected the engine to power what became the A-6 Intruder.\n\nThe J52-P-6 model, designed for the YA2F-1 (YA-6A) Intruder, had a unique nozzle that could be angled downward at 23 degrees for STOL takeoffs; this was not used on production A-6s. Returning full circle, the J52 was selected to power the A4D-5, another model of the A-4 Skyhawk, remaining in all subsequent new-built models.\n\nThe twin-spool J52 employs a split 12-stage axial compressor consisting of a five-stage low pressure unit and a seven-stage high pressure unit. Behind the compressor is a nine-unit can-annular combustion chamber and a two-stage split turbine.\n\nIn 1960, U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC) developed procedures so that the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress could use the Hound Dog's J52 engine for additional thrust while the missile was located on the bomber's two pylons. This helped heavily laden B-52s fly away from their airbases faster, which would have been useful in case of nuclear attacks on the bases. The Hound Dog could then be refueled from the B-52's wing fuel tanks.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1881 he was appointed as the minister at Dresden-Striesen and in 1887 he became minister of the Jerusalem Church in Berlin. In 1889 he also became a \"privatdozent\", a form of tutor, in the University of Berlin, and four years later was appointed as an extraordinary professor of divinity. He fought for a more presbyterian and democratic constitution in the congregations of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces. His grave is preserved in the Protestant \"Friedhof II der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde\" (Cemetery No. II of the congregations of the Jerusalem's Church and the New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of the Hallesches Tor.\n\nSoden introduced a new notation of manuscripts and also developed a new theory of textual history. He believed that in the 4th century there were in existence three recensions of the text of the New Testament, which he distinguished as \"K\", \"H\" and \"I\". After establishing the text of \"I\", \"H\" and \"K\", Soden reconstructed a hypothetical text, \"I-H-K\", which he believed to have been their ancestor. He then tried to show that this text was known to all the writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries\n\nSoden died in a railway accident in Berlin on January 15, 1914. His descendant Wolfram von Soden became a noted Assyriologist.\n\nHis most important book is \"Die Schriften des neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt / hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte\" (4 vols., Berlin: Glaue, 1902-1910); certainly the most important work on the text of the New Testament which had been published since Westcott and Hort's \"The New Testament in the Original Greek\". Other works include:\n\n\nHe contributed to the 1903 \"Encyclopaedia Biblica\" and to the \"Hand-Commentar zum Neuen Testament\", several editions, started in 1855 by Heinrich Julius Holtzmann and Hans von Soden\n"}

Season one was filmed in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico due to tax breaks the production was eligible for under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Season two was filmed in Eilat, Israel. Season three was filmed in Pretoria, South Africa, with some sequences shot in Mauritius.\n\nThe plot revolves around private investigator, Nick Slaughter, an ex-DEA agent, who after arriving in the fictional resort town of Key Mariah, Florida, and setting up a detective agency there, meets up with local tourist agent, Sylvie Girard, to solve a variety of different cases.\n\n\nThe series was particularly popular in Serbia, where it gained cult status. In a tumultuous social environment – with a UN trade embargo imposed on the country and civil war raging nearby – Nick Slaughter's character became a tongue-in-cheek role model, particularly among urban youth, and eventually a symbol of opposition politics.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the series was broadcast on four Serbian television stations – TV Politika (1992–93), NS+ (1993–94), RTS 3K (1994–95), and RTV Pink (1996–97) – and rerun numerous times. Aside from its dry humor and exciting plot, the show was extremely well received because its idyllic tropical island atmosphere was an absolute contrast to mid-1990s Serbia. The reruns in the then-isolated country made the show immensely popular, turning it into a minor national cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe notion of Nick Slaughter being a widely received hero in Serbia probably began in the Belgrade suburb of Žarkovo where, now-legendary, graffiti \"Sloteru Niče, Žarkovo ti kliče\" (\"Nick Slaughter, Žarkovo hails you\", which rhymes in Serbian) appeared. Soon afterward during the massive months-long protests throughout winter 1996–97 against the alleged election fraud perpetrated by Slobodan Milošević and his party at the November 1996 local elections, the slogan \"Slotera Nika, za predsednika\" (\"Nick Slaughter for President\", also rhymes in Serbian) became popular on banners and badges as a symbol of opposition to the regime. Another popular slogan was \"Svakoj majci treba da je dika, koja ima sina k'o Slotera Nika\" (\"Every mother should be proud to have a son like Nick Slaughter\"). Serbian punk band Atheist Rap paid a tribute to the series' protagonist in the song \"Slaughteru Nietzsche\" with its graffiti-based chorus \"Sloteru Niče, Srbija ti kliče\" (\"Nick Slaughter, Serbia hails you\") on their 1998 album \"II liga zapad\". In 2008, Rob Stewart performed the song with the band on stage.\n\nMany local bars, taverns, and summer patios in Serbia were (re)named Tropical Heat in honour of Nick Slaughter and the popular TV show. They were usually located along the rivers, to resemble \"The Key Mariah Spirit\".\n\nApparently, no one associated with the show was aware of its extraordinary popularity in Serbia until December 2008 when Canadian actor Rob Stewart who played Nick Slaughter in the series accidentally discovered it by stumbling upon a Facebook fan group named \"Tropical Heat/Nick Slaughter\" with some 17,000 (mostly Serbian) followers. After familiarizing himself with the cause and the circumstances of his Serbian fame, the mostly unemployed 48-year-old Stewart, along with a filmmaker friend Marc Vespi and his sister Liza, decided to attempt to make \"Slaughter Nick for President\", a documentary about it. To that end, they contacted the band Atheist Rap and it was soon arranged for Rob to appear on stage as their guest at the To Be Punk Festival in Novi Sad on June 6.\n\nBy late March 2009 the news was leaked to Serbian press and several media outlets carried items that Rob Stewart would be coming to Serbia in May or early June as guest of Atheist Rap in order to film a documentary on his character's popularity in the country during the 1990s. Stewart and his partners contacted Srđa Popović, former activist of Otpor!, the Serbian student movement that played a significant role in eventually bringing down Milošević. On June 3, 2009, Stewart arrived in Belgrade to a hero's welcome with enormous media attention afforded to his visit. With Atheist Rap and Popović as their hosts and guides through Serbia, and in between the documentary shooting schedule, Stewart made the media rounds, appearing on talk shows (\"Piramida\" and \"Fajront Republika\"), giving interviews, and making public appearances such as planting of the maple trees in Žarkovo with John Morrison, Canadian ambassador to Serbia.\n\nAs a result of their June 2009 stay in Belgrade and Novi Sad, a six-minute documentary promo was put together and entered in the Roma Fiction Fest in Rome, Italy on July 8, 2009 under the \"work in progress\" section.\n\nTwo episodes of the show were re-edited into a feature-length film, \"Criss Cross\". IMDb states this received a release in 2001.\n\nTango Entertainment released the complete series on DVD on January 8, 2008 in a 9-disc set entitled \"Tropical Heat: Sweating Bullets Complete series\".\n\n\n"}

It was about a mile in circumference and was flanked with towers. The town served as the base of the Roman Catholic missionaries to Ethiopia during the 16th and 17th centuries. Bernhard Lindahl identifies Fremona with the modern settlement of Endiet Nebersh, located 10 kilometers from Adwa.\n\nFremona was originally called \"Maigoga\" (\"mai\", Tigrinya \"water,\" and \"guagua\", \"noisy\") because of the two rocky streams that ran through the community. The origin of the name is uncertain but it is very old, appearing on Aksumite inscriptions; it was not renamed by the Jesuit missionaries. It was there that bishop Andrés de Oviedo died and was buried in 1577, and his tomb became a shrine to the local Catholics.\n\nWhen the Jesuit Manuel de Almeida visited Fremona in 1624, he found that it had been improved with \"seven or eight bastions with high curtain walls, two courtyards, one of which adjoins the houses, where a good stone tank has been made, and another were a beautiful church was now being built of stone and lime.\" He adds that due to the rarity of firearms in Ethiopia at the time, \"with twenty or thirty muskets, a small cannon and the sons of the Portuguese manning them, [it] was held in Ethiopia to be a unique and impregnable place.\"\n\nIt was here that the Catholic priests, patriarch and bishop were exiled, after Emperor Fasilides condemned Catholicism and restored to official status the traditional beliefs of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in 1634. At the time, Jerónimo Lobo states that the town had 400 inhabitants.\n\nAfter the Catholic missionaries were banished from Ethiopia, Fremona was eventually abandoned; the details are unknown. The Ethiopian historian Richard Pankhurst cites a taxation report from 1697 that mentions Fremona under its old name Maigoga. Yet when Henry Salt travelled through the area in the 1800s, he reported that he was unable to find anyone who recognized the name.\n"}
{"id": "2145377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145377", "title": "Karner blue", "text": "Karner blue\n\nThe Karner blue (\"Plebejus melissa samuelis\") is an endangered subspecies of small blue butterfly found in some Great Lakes states, small areas of New Jersey, the Capital District region of New York, and southern New Hampshire, where it is the official state butterfly. The butterfly, whose life cycle depends on the wild blue lupine flower (\"Lupinus perennis\"), was classified as an endangered species in the United States in 1992. \n\nThis subspecies of \"Plebejus melissa\" was first identified and described by novelist Vladimir Nabokov. The name originates from Karner, New York (located half-way between Albany and Schenectady) in the Albany Pine Bush, where it was first discovered.\nIn the novel \"Pnin\", Nabokov describes a score of Karner blues without naming them.\n\nLupine blooms in late May. There are two generations of Karner blues per year, the first in late May to mid June, the second from mid-July to mid-August. \n\nLocal conservation efforts, concentrating on replanting large areas of blue lupine which have been lost to development (and to fire suppression, which destroys the open, sandy habitat required by blue lupine), are having modest success at encouraging the butterfly's repopulation. The Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central Wisconsin is home to the world's largest population of Karner blues, which benefit from its vast area of savanna and extensive lupine.\n\nIn May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Karner blue as being locally extinct in Canada. In 2012, after an unusually hot and dry year, the Karner blue was extirpated in the Indiana Dunes National Park.\n\nThe male and female of this small (wingspan of about one inch) butterfly are different in appearance. The topside of the male is silvery or dark blue with narrow black margins. The female is grayish brown, especially on the outer portions of the wings, to blue on the topside, with irregular bands of orange crescents inside the narrow black border. The underside of both sexes is gray with a continuous band of orange crescents along the edges of both wings and with scattered black spots circled with white.\n\nThe Karner blue butterfly occurs in portions of eastern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York. Reintroductions have been initiated in Ohio and New Hampshire. The Karner blue butterfly appears extirpated from Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maine, and Ontario.\n\nAlthough Karner blue butterflies are characteristic of oak savannas (\"Quercus spp.\") and pine barrens (\"Pinus spp.\") habitats, they also occur in frequently disturbed areas such as rights-of-way, old fields, and road margins. In east-central New York, Karner blue butterflies occurred in 3 rights-of-way habitat types: wild lily-of-the-valley-starflower (Maianthemum canadensis-Trientalis borealis), sweetfern-whorled yellow loosestrife (\"Comptonia peregrina-Lysimachia quadrifolia\"), and blackberry-sheep sorrel (\"Rubus\" spp. \"Rumex acetosella\"). An index of Karner blue population size was highest in the wild lily-of-the-valley-starflower type. In this habitat, mosses (Bryophyta, 6.9%), wild lily-of-the-valley (4.4%), grasses (Poaceae, 4.4%), and starflower (2.1%) had the highest cover. Coverage in the sweetfern-whorled yellow loosestrife type was dominated by grasses (40.9%), sweetfern (12.1%), mosses (9.4%), and whorled yellow loosestrife (5.2%). In the blackberry-sheep sorrel type, the dominants included grasses (22.7%), northern dewberry (\"Rubus flagellaris\", 5.0%), other blackberries (4.8%), and sheep sorrel (4.3%).\n\nSeveral studies have found a positive relationship between measures of wild lupine and Karner blue butterfly abundance. However, available evidence suggests that senescent wild lupine is a poor larval food source. The effects of other phenological stages are more ambiguous. In west-central Wisconsin, Karner blue butterfly abundance was negatively associated with the abundance of reproductive lupine and positively related with the frequency of immature wild lupine. However, a feeding trial found that Karner blue butterfly fed 1st year wild lupine had one of the lowest survival rates observed and significantly longer larval durations than larvae fed older wild lupine that did not flower, was flowering, had recently flowered, or was grown in shade and was in seed. In addition, on sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota, the number of 1st flight oviposition sites on nonreproductive and reproductive wild lupine was similar.\n\nMany other factors may influence the quality of wild lupine (\"Lupinus perennis\") as a Karner blue butterfly food resource. At Indiana Dunes National Park, wild lupine with Karner blue butterfly feeding damage had significantly larger leaves and longer and thicker stems than plants without feeding damage. In addition, larval length was positively associated with wild lupine height in central Wisconsin. Higher nitrogen concentrations in wild lupine leaves resulted in significantly shorter larval durations in a feeding trial. In 1995, in west-central Wisconsin, significantly more Karner blue butterfly larvae were observed in oak-pine barren plots where mildew infection was delayed compared to areas where wild lupine were infected earlier. However, in a feeding trial larval duration of Karner blue butterflies fed mildew-infected wild lupine was not significantly different from treatments that resulted in the shortest larval durations. Karner blue butterfly fed water-stressed wild lupine had significantly longer larval durations than many treatments including larvae fed flowering wild lupine, shade-grown wild lupine in seed, or mildew-infected wild lupine. Although Karner blue butterflies have been shown to benefit from their association with ants, wild lupine with Karner blue butterfly larvae in the Allegan State Game Area in Michigan were not detectably closer to ant hills than wild lupine without caterpillars.\n\nDue to effects of environmental variation and differing requirements among life stages, broods, and sexes, Karner blue butterflies require a mosaic of sun and shade.\n\nAdult Karner blue butterflies' preference for open, sunny areas has been well documented. Increased lupine and nectar abundance, higher temperatures allowing for longer activity periods, and ease of finding mates have been suggested as possible reasons for adult preference of open areas.\n\nAdult Karner blue butterfly females are more likely to use shaded habitats than males. Avoiding harassment by males and compromising between greater amounts of wild lupine in open areas and better quality of wild lupine in shaded areas (see below) have been suggested as possible reasons for increased occurrence of females in shade.\n\nDifferences between broods have also been observed. In west-central Wisconsin, abundance of spring adults positively correlated with decreasing canopy cover, while correlation with summer adults was very weak. At Indiana Dunes National Park, cover at late summer oviposition sites was significantly higher than at late spring oviposition sites. In Wisconsin and Minnesota, late spring oviposition sites occurred in partial and closed habitats significantly more than expected based on the number of nectar flowers and the cover and number of wild lupine stems, while summer oviposition sites did not differ significantly from expected. The different brood responses to shade may be due to the direct impact of varying environmental conditions over the course of the season on Karner blue butterflies (see section \"Temperature\") and the associated effects on wild lupine (see below).\n\nLarvae in shaded habitat apparently have an advantage over those in open areas. The increase in larvae in shaded habitats is likely due to effects of shade on wild lupine.\n\nShade-grown wild lupine has been shown to provide higher quality larval resource than sun-grown lupine. Several reasons for this have been suggested. An often cited reason for the dependence of larvae, especially 2nd-brood larvae, on shaded habitat is the possibility of early senescence of wild lupine in open areas resulting in a lack of larval food. Shade-grown wild lupine being more nutritious, possibly due to nitrogen content limiting photosynthesis to a greater extent in open areas, was one of several explanations. The size of wild lupine has been positively associated with Karner blue butterfly larval length and amount of feeding damage. In addition, there may be shade-related effects on Karner blue butterflies that are related to the density of wild lupine. Wild lupine are typically more abundant in open areas than in shade. Mildew infection of wild lupine may be increased in denser wild lupine patches. Lower mildew infection rates in shadier areas have been reported. However the implications of mildew infection on Karner blue butterfly are uncertain (see section \"Wild lupine\"). It has also been suggested that the low density of wild lupine in shadier habitats could provide better larval habitat due to the increased search effort required by predators. This trade-off between lupine quality and quantity is another reason heterogeneous habitat is important for Karner blue butterfly.\n\nOn sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota, canopy cover did not have a significant (p>0.06) effect on total numbers of ants, parasitoids, or predators. However, certain species did show trends across canopy cover categories. For instance the ant Formica nitidiventris was only seen in open (≤15% cover) areas, while another ant, Dolichoderus plagiatus was only observed in areas with a dense canopy (≥76% cover). Parasitoids in the genera Phaeogenes and Orthostigma were all seen in closed habitats, while 90% of damsel bugs (Nabicula subcoleoptrata), a potential predator, were observed in open areas. Closed habitats had insignificantly (p=0.116) more parasitoids on average than partial (16%–75% cover) and closed habitats.\n\nNectar availability is likely to influence Karner blue butterfly abundance. In a right-of-way in west-central Wisconsin, the frequency that Karner blue butterflies stayed in an area between recaptures was significantly (p<0.05) positively related to percent cover of nectar flowers such as Canadian horseweed (Conyza canadensis var. canadensis) and spotted beebalm (Monarda punctata). Preliminary results from a study in southeastern Minnesota suggest that openings where Karner blue butterflies were detected tended to have more flowering nectar species. In Michigan, more Karner blue butterflies were observed on sites with more nectaring plants, especially butterfly milkweed (\"Asclepias tuberosa\"). As discussed in Canopy cover, nectar species increase in open habitats. For instance, at Fort McCoy in west-central Wisconsin, all the nectar species listed for Karner blue butterflies require either full or partial sun. In addition, treatments such as cutting with or without herbicides, herbicide application alone, or mowing at varying intervals resulted in a significant (p<0.01) increase in the number and cover of nectar species. See section \"Food habits\" for species that Karner blue butterflies use as nectar sources.\n\nOther habitat characteristics: Although Schweitzer asserts that the presence of litter is important to Karner blue butterflies in some years, abundance in a right-of-way in west-central Wisconsin was negatively (p<0.05) related with average litter cover.\n\nIn west-central Wisconsin, the amount of Karner blue butterfly larval feeding damage increased with grass cover. A review suggests that grass cover may provide roosting sites for Karner blue butterflies and that 5% cover of tall grass would most likely meet this need.\n\nKarner blue butterflies may be associated with disturbance. Although results may have been biased by a significant (p=0.009) positive correlation (r=0.2173) between patch area and number of disturbances (such as burning, vehicle traffic, and thinning and clearing), patches in a right-of-way in west-central Wisconsin occupied by Karner blue butterflies had a greater frequency of disturbance than unoccupied patches (p≤0.0125). In the same area, the abundance of the Karner blue butterfly spring brood was positively related to trails, and the percent of lupine stems with larval feeding damage was significantly (p<0.05) greater in areas disturbed by military vehicle traffic.\n\nKarner blue butterflies are directly affected by temperature. A laboratory investigation of temperature on Karner blue butterfly found that flight typically begins at 76 °F (24.6 °C) for females and 80 °F (26.4 °C) for males (p=0.25). Signs of heat stress started at 96 °F (35.6 °C) for females and 98 °F (36.8 °C) for males (p=0.25). In pine-oak barrens in Wisconsin, observation rates of Karner blue butterflies increased significantly (p=0.000) with increasing temperature.\n\nThe effect of temperature can influence the occurrence of Karner blue butterflies in habitats of varying canopy cover. The lower temperatures occurring in partial and shaded habitats of Wisconsin and Minnesota meant that 1st-flight females only had access to these areas for a few hours a day. In contrast, these females could access open habitats an average of 10.5 hours a day. The percent of adults in habitats of varying canopy categories was significantly (p=0.0001) influenced by temperature, with butterflies, especially females, increasing in partial (15-75%) and shaded (>75%) habitats with increasing temperature. In addition, 80% (n=45) of 1st-flight ovipositions when temperatures were cool (68-79 °F, 20-26 °C) were in sun, while only 40% (n=17) of 1st-flight ovipositions in hot temperatures (86-97 °F, 30-36 °C) occurred in the sun. The same trend was observed in 2nd-flight ovipositions. In cool temperatures 65% (n=11) of ovipositions occurred in the sun, while in hot temperatures only 40% (n=37) occurred in the sun.\n\nTemperature also influences Karner blue butterfly phenology and brood success. Weather had strong influence on Karner blue butterfly phenology at Fort McCoy in west-central Wisconsin. In a cool year the 2nd-brood flight began 6 June, while in a warmer year adults were 1st detected on 22 May. In addition, compared to the previous year the flight of the 2nd-brood during the hot year was shortened by 20 days. At Indiana Dunes National Park, evidence suggests that cool winters negatively impact 1st-brood populations and cool summers positively affect 2nd-brood populations. A review suggests that the cover provided by snowpack protects Karner blue butterfly eggs from hatching prematurely or being overheated by direct sunlight. Therefore, short periods of continuous snow cover due to site conditions or mild winters could result in decreased occurrence or smaller populations of Karner blue butterflies.\n\nKarner blue butterflies are dependent on heterogeneous habitat as it provides the varied requirements of different Karner blue butterfly broods, sexes, and life stages over a wide range of environmental conditions. Research at Indiana Dunes National Park led to recommendations for canopy openings for adult males and nectaring of both sexes, as well as areas with 30-60% cover for ovipositing females. In the Allegan State Game Area, wild lupine patches occupied by Karner blue butterflies had higher density of edge habitats that unoccupied wild lupine patches. In west-central Wisconsin the importance of shaded habitat led to a recommendation that 20% to 40% of Karner blue butterfly habitat provide shaded lupine and that 1/3 have >60% canopy cover with succession in these dense areas allowed to progress to complete closure. Maxwell also suggests avoiding any management that would result in habitat homogenization. The Karner blue butterfly recovery team mentions the importance of a wide range of aspects, hydrology, microtopography as well canopy cover (0-90%) in conserving the Karner blue butterfly. However, Karner blue populations can persist in relatively homogenous habitats. For instance, a population has persisted at the Saratoga Airport in New York in open habitat maintained by regular mowing. More information on the habitat characteristics, environmental conditions, and/or geographic variability in habitat requirements that facilitate Karner blue butterfly's persistence in these areas is needed.\n\nSize of habitat patches can also influence Karner blue butterfly abundance (see section \"Wild lupine\"). At the Allegan State Game Area, wild lupine patches occupied by Karner blue butterflies were larger than unoccupied patches. This was also the case at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin. In addition to the effect of amount of wild lupine, a review suggests that it is easier to maintain Karner blue butterfly habitat in larger patches. Lane notes the need to find a balance between having patches of different required habitats within the activity range of Karner blue butterflies and having open areas large enough that they do not become shaded too quickly. Canopy openings with diameters of at least 82 feet (25 m) were recommended based on research at Indiana Dunes National Park, and research in Wisconsin and Minnesota led to a recommended opening size of 1.5 times the height of adjacent trees. According to a review, subpopulations in habitat patches of less than 0.25 ha (0.62 acres) are vulnerable to extirpation.\n\nGiven their typically short dispersal distance, the spatial arrangement of habitat is important to the conservation of the Karner blue butterfly. Distance between the various types of habitat required by Karner blue butterflies is likely an influential landscape attribute. Lane suggests that suitable Karner blue butterfly habitat occurs in areas where open and closed canopies occur within a 590-foot (180 m) diameter. Maxwell recommends considering the amount of shaded wild lupine habitat within the dispersal distance of Karner blue butterfly when reducing overstory. Many investigators stress the importance of habitat patches being closely spaced. For instance, at sites in west-central Wisconsin, the average distance from an occupied wild lupine patch to another occupied patch was significantly (p=0.002) shorter (709 feet, 216 m) than to an unoccupied patch (1,155 feet, 352 m). Wild lupine patches in the same area that were occupied by Karner blue butterflies were also surrounded by a relatively low percentage of unoccupied patches. In addition, wild lupine patches in the Allegan State Game Area that were occupied by Karner blue butterflies were closer to other occupied patches than wild lupine patches without Karner blue butterflies. This led to the recommendation that habitat patches be within 230 feet (70 m) of each other. Isolation of habitat patches has been suggested as a reason for lack of Karner blue butterfly presence on sites in New York. In addition, studies of Karner blue butterfly dispersal have led to recommended distance between patches of ≤980 feet (300 m) to allow for dispersal and management units no wider than 1,300 to 1,600 feet (400–500 m) to improve recolonization of treated areas.\n\nThe presence of dispersal corridors may assist with Karner blue butterfly dispersal. Karner blue butterflies appear to disperse further in open habitats (see section \"Timing of major life history events\"). However, there is uncertainty regarding what constitutes a corridor or a barrier to dispersal. Creation of corridors with both lupine for larvae and nectar species for adults may be useful in connecting habitat patches.\n\nKarner blue butterflies have two broods per year, following wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) phenology quite closely. Eggs laid by Karner blue butterflies in late summer overwinter and hatch in mid- to late April. Development from egg through four larval instars and pupation takes from 25 to 60 days. The average lifespan of adult Karner blue butterflies has been reported at between 3 and 5 days. The first Karner blue butterfly flight generally occurs sometime between mid-May and mid-June, with males typically appearing earlier than females. First flight females lay the vast majority of their eggs on wild lupine. These eggs develop into the adults of the second Karner blue butterfly flight, which generally occurs in July and August. Although always near a wild lupine plant, second brood females lay more eggs on grasses, other plants, and litter than 1st brood females. The 2nd flight is typically two to four times the size of the first flight. However, the first flight of Karner blue butterflies can be larger than the second. Timing and size of both flights can exhibit substantial variation, depending on local weather conditions among other factors.\n\nA wide range of values related to Karner blue butterfly recruitment have been reported. Adult Karner blue sex ratios vary from 1 male to 1.44 females to 2 males to 1 female. Wild caught Karner blue butterfly females have been observed to lay from 7.7 to 83 eggs on average. Reported percentages of eggs that reach adulthood under controlled conditions vary from 21.4% to 75.2%. In the wild, loss of eggs may be substantial.\n\nKarner blue butterflies do not typically move very far, with males usually moving further than females, with most studies showing average distances moved by individual butterflies of well under .\n\nWild lupine is the sole larval food source of the Karner blue butterfly. Adult Karner blue butterflies obtain nectar from several native and nonnative species. Karner blue butterflies have been reported feeding on the nectar of 41 different species in a single study in west-central Wisconsin. Broods differ significantly in the species used for nectaring, likely due to differences in their phenology. Several blackberries have been documented as food sources for the spring brood, while spotted beebalm, white sweetclover (\"Melilotus alba\"), and flowering spurge (\"Euphorbia corollata\"), are widely cited sources of nectar in the summer. Common cinquefoil (\"Potentilla simplex\") is used as a nectar species for both broods. Karner blue butterflies' preferred nectar species may include butterfly weed in New York and Michigan and lyrate rockcress (\"Arabis lyrata\"), lanceleaf tickseed (\"Coreopsis lanceolata\"), white sweetclover, and northern dewberry (\"Rubus flagellaris\") at Indiana Dunes National Park. Differences in nectar species used between male and female Karner blue butterflies and across locations have been reported. Other often mentioned nectar sources include New Jersey tea (\"Ceanothus americanus\"), wild lupine, goldenrods (\"Solidago spp.\"), and spotted knapweed (\"Centaurea maculosa\").\n\nSpiders and many insects are the major predators of Karner blue butterflies. The seven-spotted lady beetle is one of the few confirmed predators of Karner blue butterfly larvae. Paper wasps (\"Polistes spp.\"), spined soldier bugs, and ants (\"Formica spp.\") have been observed removing larvae, and the ant \"Monomorium emarginatum\" has been seen chewing on Karner blue butterfly eggs. There is currently no explanation for the removal of larvae or chewing of eggs by some of the same ant species that tend larvae. Other potential predators of Karner blue butterfly larvae include green lacewings, soldier beetles, and damsel bugs. Predators of adult Karner blue butterflies include dragonflies, robber flies, ambush bugs (Phymatidae) and spiders, such as crab spiders. Assassin bugs (Reduviidae) are also likely predators of adult Karner blue butterflies.\n\nOther likely predators include white-tailed deer and birds. Incidental predation of Karner blue butterfly eggs, larvae, and pupae by white-tailed deer grazing on wild lupine can be substantial.\n\nWasps are the most commonly reported parasitoids of Karner blue butterflies. A tachinid fly, \"Aplomya theclarum\", has also been listed as a Karner blue butterfly parasite. Two wasps, one from the Trichogrammatidae family and another tentatively identified as a member of the Eulophidae family, are suspected to parasitize Karner blue butterfly eggs.\n\nKarner blue butterfly larvae benefit from a facultative, mutualistic relationship with several ant species. In pitch pine-bear oak (\"Pinus rigida\"-\"Quercus ilicifolia\") habitat in New York, significantly more larvae tended by ants survived (67%) than untended larvae (38%). The 19 ant species tending Karner blue butterfly larvae were from the subfamilies Formicinae, Myrmicinae, and Dolichoderinae, which are the most common in the area. The species of ant is likely to influence the degree of benefit gained by Karner blue butterfly larvae. At sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota, ant tending rates increased significantly with increasing larval age. The Karner blue larvae also has fine hairs on it to protect itself. In a study of the effect of different experimental feeding treatments, Karner blue butterfly larvae tended by ants had one of the shortest observed larval durations and gained the most weight for the amount of lupine eaten.\n\nAccording to reviews, habitat loss through direct conversion to other land uses and through succession are considered the major causes of the decline of the Karner blue butterfly. At the time of this writing (2006), two reviews summarize the recent status of Karner blue butterfly across its range. Recovery criteria are addressed by, while Christenson and Lentz discuss lessons learned developing a statewide Habitat Conservation Plan for Wisconsin.\n\nArticles that address Karner blue butterfly sampling methodology include. Swengel found that surveys for Karner blue butterfly adults appeared more efficient than those for larvae. Evidence of different catchability and/or detectability of male and female Karner blue butterflies led King to suggest calculating male and female population sizes separately. General descriptions of Karner blue butterfly rearing methods and translocation/ reintroduction techniques are available.\n\nA wide variety of management techniques can be compatible with maintaining Karner blue butterfly populations when attention is paid to implementing them at appropriate times and at intensities, scales, and frequencies that Karner blue butterflies can tolerate. For example, mowing can maintain open areas with little to no detrimental effect on Karner blue butterflies on sites where burning is impractical or in areas too small to support populations of Karner blue butterflies likely to survive a burn. On restored oak savanna sites in south-central Wisconsin, no significant (p=0.924) differences were detected between Karner blue butterfly densities on sites burned in summer, sites mowed in August, and control sites. Mowing with a blade height >4 inches (10 cm) should be performed annually or biennially in the fall or winter and clippings should be left in place. Effects of mowing, burning, and other management techniques and land uses on the average number of Karner blue butterflies observed per survey hour are included in. Recommendations on the use of a wide range of management techniques such as thinning, rotational grazing, and planting of wild lupine and/or nectar species can be found in.\n\nAccording to reviews and general field observations, management activities that are typically harmful to Karner blue butterflies include management that increases deer and/or grouse populations, close-cropped grazing, frequent or poorly-timed mowing, plowing, use of herbicides that kill lupine or nectar plants, and use of pesticides that are detrimental to Karner blue butterflies, ants they associate with, or pollinators of species they use for nectar. Information on the impacts of an insecticide on Karner blue butterflies and some herbicides on Karner blue butterflies as well as lupine and nectar species are available. According to the Karner blue butterfly recovery plan, management activities that can have a detrimental effect should be timed to allow at least 2 generations between repeat treatments and, if possible, critical subpopulations should be divided into discrete management units.\n\nGiven the wide range of nectar species used by Karner blue butterfly (see section \"Food habits\"), planting several often used or preferred nectar species is favored over selecting 1 or 2 specific species. Species selection should attempt to provide nectar sources in both open and partially shaded conditions throughout the growing season despite yearly variation in environmental conditions. Planting nonnative nectar sources is discouraged due to their potential impacts on native food sources, especially wild lupine.\n\nHeterogeneity is an important feature of Karner blue butterfly habitat. Specific recommendations regarding the spatial arrangement of the various required habitat types and Karner blue butterfly habitat patches are discussed in Landscape effects. Creation and rotation of management units should incorporate this information as well as data on Karner blue butterfly movement (see section \"Timing of major life history events\"). Bidwell recommends management units be a maximum of 1,300 to 1,600 feet (400–500 m) wide to improve recolonization from neighboring areas. Depending on the available and surrounding habitat, managing for heterogeneity could mean implementing a wide range of techniques.\n\n"}

Kisekae is short for \"kisekae ningyou\"; a Japanese term meaning \"dress-up dolls\". Unlike \"computer art\" which creates or displays traditional art via a computer, KiSS uses the computer as the medium, allowing the art to be not only animated, but also interactive.\n\nKiSS is an Open standard which has to some extent been implemented on many platforms, including several PDAs. It has also been implemented in Java and on the web.\n\nKiSS originated in Japan in 1991 with \"dolls\" based on shōjo manga characters.\n\nThe original dolls, a series of simple, static images, could be moved about and layered on top of one another to look as if the doll image was wearing the clothing. Using computer graphics had the advantage over traditional paper dolls in allowing multiple layers to move in unison, including visually separate pieces, giving an illusion of depth not possible with physical paper.\n\nThe initial viewer software was designed for NEC PC-9800 series using a palette of 16 colours to display the doll. Shortly after, an enhanced standard was put forward (General Specification 2 known as 'KiSS/GS2') which included support for VGA cards and 256 or multiple 16 colour palettes. This standard is still the basis of KiSS, but several additional specifications have been incorporated into viewers since then, in particular \"French KiSS\", generally called FKiSS, for controlling interactivity and animation and \"Cherry KiSS\" (i.e. CKiSS) for 32-bit \"true\" colour support.\n\nBy the late 1990s KiSS had spread from the Japanese BBS communities internationally via the Internet with artists creating \"dolls\", programmers creating support tools, and fans appearing worldwide.\n\nNote that although KiSS sets are often referred to generically as 'dolls' they are not confined to dress-up — in fact they can be anything and there are \"build-your-own\" faces, wedding cakes, dollhouses, battleships, as well as puzzles, games and much more. Nonetheless such \"unusual\" sets are sometimes referred to as \"aberrant\" KiSS.\n\nA KiSS set consists of many files of a number of different formats. These are packaged for distribution as a single set or 'doll' in LZH format (a preferred archive format in Japan) which viewer programs can read as a whole to obtain the individual files.\n\nMost files are 'cel' files which are raw, uncompressed graphics data analogous to animation cels. KiSS/GS2 specification cels also require a KCF (KiSS Colour File) as a palette, but CKiSS specification cels do not. A KCF also can control background colour and contain multiple palettes that can be swapped for lighting and colour change effects. All KiSS binary files (KCF, standard and CKiSS cels) since KiSS/GS2 share a common 32 byte binary header record identifying the size, type and format of KiSS data they contain.\n\nA configuration file is also required to control field size, layering, cel position, use of palettes, and interaction and animation events.\n\nIn addition Midi files for music and WAV files for sound clips may be used, and generally some form of text documentation is included by the artist.\n\nKiSS sets are allowed to acquire resources from other KiSS sets by a process called 'Expansion'. This allows new versions of a doll without incorporating the original cells into the new set, meaning that earlier versions did not have to be replaced, and different artists could add to the doll without confusion as to who the original artist was. This dates from some of the earliest viewers, but the details of loading an expansion set remain somewhat viewer dependent.\n\nA number of features have been added to KiSS but never formally incorporated into the main KiSS format. For compatibility and to hide them from viewers that don't support them they are disguised as comments in the configuration file. Each type of extension (except user grouping) was initially introduced in Japan, however all (except Cherry KiSS) have later been extended by international viewers.\n\n'French' KiSS (or 'FKiSS') is an event driven scripting language created as an experimental add-on to the KiSS/GS2 specifications. It was introduced in Japan to allow animation and greater interactivity in KiSS. It was the first extension, and intended only for testing but it proved so popular that it became entrenched as is. All FKiSS directives appear preceded in the first column of their configuration line by:\nThe \";\" normally indicates the beginning of a comment, which originally hid the directive if a viewer didn't handle FKiSS although it is now standard in all viewers.\n\nFKiSS itself has been extended several times:\n\nThese are additions to the cell definitions to control start up properties. They appear as a comment at the end of the cell definition that immediately starts with a % and a code. The first (%t - to control initial transparency) was added when the first level of FKiSS was finalized. Other properties added with FKiSS4 include display status (%u), clickability (%g) and offset overrides (%x and %y).\n\nThese are comment added to the configuration to suggest to the viewer program how best to automatically display the set. Originally used in Japan to indicate other KiSS sets of which the current one is an expansion (;INCLUDE -- i.e. where to find referenced resources not included in the set), later viewers use them to indicate optimal settings for the set being loaded (;HINT).\n\nCommonly called 'CKiSS', this is an extension to the binary data header record, and unlike other extensions makes no changes to the configuration file. It is a specification allowing a cell file to contain raw 24-bit colour data and an 8 bit alpha channel for variable transparency. CKiSS cells tend to use a lot of disk space compared to palette-based cels, and do not compress well, so they are used sparingly by most artists.\n\nUser groupings were added along with FKiSS4 to simplify controlling large numbers of cells (or uniquely identify specific cells) for testing and animation.\n\nThere are many programs on most platforms which can convert from standard graphics formats (most commonly BMP, GIF or PSD files) to KiSS cel and KCF files, allowing the artist to create the original images with any freeware or proprietary graphics program. In addition, GIMP is a fully featured graphics program which can open and save CEL files directly, leaving no need for conversion.\n\nThe configuration file is written with a text editor (standard as part of any Operating System software). Once the basic files are created a KiSS viewer is used to display and fine tune the set, then an archiver with LZH capability is used for packaging. All the software needed is freely available on the internet, as are detailed tutorials for KiSS creation.\n\nThe modern KiSS community on the internet resembles the dolling community with which there is a degree of overlap, though the two are distinct and each is protective of its own art. However, since KiSS art is more specialized the KiSS community is centralized around the largest archive of dolls on the internet, the BiG KiSS Page. Unfortunately in recent years bandwidth costs have forced the BKP to allow most doll downloads by subscription only, which has had negative impacts on the size of the active community.\n\nBecause being able to dress a doll implies being able to undress as well there has always been a subgenre of 'adult' KiSS which exists independently of the main community.\n"}

Three years later, she won her first of seven ladies singles titles. On 6 April 1907 she married Robert Lambert Chambers and was thereafter known by her married surname Lambert Chambers.\n\nIn 1908 she won the gold medal in the women's singles event at the 1908 Summer Olympics after a straight-sets victory in the final against compatriot Dora Boothby.\n\nShe wrote \"Tennis for Ladies\", which was published in 1910. The book contained photographs of tennis techniques and contained advice on attire and equipment.\n\nIn 1911 Lambert Chambers won the women's final at Wimbledon against Dora Boothby 6–0, 6–0, the first player to win a Grand Slam singles final without losing a game. The only other female player to achieve this was Steffi Graf when she defeated Natalia Zvereva in the 1988 French Open final.\n\nIn 1919 Lambert Chambers played the longest Wimbledon final up to that time: 44 games against Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen.

RPAA was chartered as a 501(c)(3) charity in 1982.\n\nBegun in the summer of 1981, this annual event has raised well over $130,000 benefitting a variety of regional charities benefiting \"kids and animals.\" Local bands play for free and no admission is charged to the grounds where the event takes place, the money coming from the sale of tee-shirts and of cold beverages. Musical styles presented run from rock and roll, and country to Bluegrass and the Blues. More Opry than opera... Spittoono was held in the parking lot of the ESSO Club from 1981 to 1990 by which time it had outgrown the available space.

The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The winner receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand, usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums. Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.\nBefore the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests. The first two were marketed as the \"AFL–NFL World Championship Game\", but were also casually referred to as \"the Super Bowl game\" during the television broadcast. Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \"Super Bowl\" moniker in official marketing; the names \"Super Bowl I\" and \"Super Bowl II\" were retroactively applied to the first two games. The NFC/NFL is currently tied with the AFC/AFL at 27 wins for each. 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city, have won the Super Bowl.\n\nThe New England Patriots () and Pittsburgh Steelers () have won the most Super Bowls with six championships, while the Dallas Cowboys () and the San Francisco 49ers () have five wins. The New England Patriots have the most Super Bowl appearances with 11, while the Buffalo Bills () have the most consecutive appearances with four (all losses) from 1990 to 1993.

{"id": "2145417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145417", "title": "A New Brain", "text": "A New Brain\n\nA New Brain is a musical with music and lyrics by William Finn and book by Finn and James Lapine. Though many of Finn's previous musicals were to some extent autobiographical, \"A New Brain\" dealt directly with his own harrowing experience with an arteriovenous malformation and the healing power of art. The hero of the musical, Gordon Schwinn, worries that he may not live to complete his work. Finn wrote many of the songs soon after his release from the hospital. The musical premiered Off-Broadway in 1998 and has been revived in the U.S., England and elsewhere.\n\n\"A New Brain\" started as a \"series of songs that Bill Finn wrote after he left the hospital\", with a concert of those songs produced at The Public Theater. A fully staged workshop production was held in 1996 and again in 1997 and included contributions by Lapine.\n\nThe musical was first produced Off-Broadway at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center, with previews beginning on May 14, 1998, and closed on October 11, 1998. The production was directed by Graciela Daniele and featured a cast headed by Malcolm Gets (Gordon Michael Schwinn) and Christopher Innvar (Roger Delli-Bovi), including Michael Mandell (Richard), Penny Fuller (Mimi Schwinn), Mary Testa (Lisa), Kristin Chenoweth (Waitress/Nancy D), Chip Zien (Mr. Bungee), Liz Larsen (Rhoda), John Jellison (Doctor), and Keith Byron Kirk (Minister). Lovette George was an understudy for Rhoda, Waitress, and Nancy D. Christopher Innvar left the show in June 1998 due to vocal problems, and Norm Lewis was to sing the role of Roger on the recording.\n\nA cast recording was made under the RCA Victor label with Norm Lewis singing the role of Roger.\n\n\"A New Brain\" was next performed at Rice University during the Sid Richardson Players' 1999-2000 season. It was also done at UC Berkeley BareStage during the 2000-2001 season, which transferred to Shotgun Players in 2001. The show was also produced in March 2002 in St. Louis, Missouri, at New Line Theatre, then premiered in the UK at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2005, with the English premiere in September 2006 in Littlehampton, West Sussex.\n\nThe musical was presented as part of the Encores! Off-Center staged concert series June 24–27, 2015 at the New York City Center. The production included multiple rewrites by Finn and Lapine and was directed by Lapine. It starred Jonathan Groff as Gordon and featured Dan Fogler as Mr. Bungee, Ana Gasteyer as Mimi, and Aaron Lazar as Roger.\n\nA new, updated cast recording has been recorded by the cast of the Encores! Off-Center production (with the exception of Fogler, who was filming a movie in London at the time of the recording and was replaced by Christian Borle as Mr. Bungee) and was released February 5, 2016, by PS Classics. Unlike the original recording, this two-disc set contains the full show, including over 15 minutes of previously unrecorded music.\nLisa, a homeless woman, asks the audience for some change. Songwriter Gordon Schwinn works at his piano to meet a deadline, irritated because he must write a song about spring for children's television host Mr. Bungee, who dresses as a frog (\"Frogs Have So Much Spring (The Spring Song)\"). Gordon takes a break from writing The Spring Song to meet his best friend Rhoda at a restaurant, where the waitress, who is a fan of Mr. Bungee, informs Gordon and Rhoda of the specials at the restaurant, including \"Calamari\". During lunch, he clutches his head and falls face first into his meal. Rhoda calls an ambulance (\"911 Emergency\") and Gordon is taken to the hospital. Gordon's greatest fear is dying with his greatest songs still inside him (\"I Have so Many Songs\"), to which he ponders about what makes a song (“Heart and Music”). Gordon's mother, Mimi, arrives and insists that (\"Mother's Gonna Make Things Fine\"). A neurosurgeon, Dr. Jafar Berensteiner, explains that there's \"Trouble in His Brain\" and that an MRI is necessary.\n\nGordon snaps at Mimi for underestimating his condition and not listening to the Doctor, to which a hallucination of Mr. Bungee appears, telling Gordon to (\"Be Polite To Everyone\"), and Gordon tells it to leave. Gordon daydreams about his boyfriend Roger, who is on his way to the hospital from a \"Sailing\" trip. The nurses, sadistic Nancy D. and compassionate Richard, are introduced. Nancy D. requests a \"Family History\", prompting Gordon to ponder why he only inherited the bad traits from his parents (\"Gordon's Law of Genetics\"). He reflects on his father's abandonment (\"And They're Off\"). \"Roger Arrives\" and spends some time with Gordon, who tells him to \"Just Go\". Richard enters to give Gordon a sponge bath in preparation for his “MRI Tomorrow”. During the sponge bath, Richard complains that he is \"Poor, Unsuccessful, and Fat\". Gordon hallucinates and sees Mr. Bungee, who continually bullies him. Gordon is visited by a minister, who tries to impose his Protestant beliefs on Gordon, who is Jewish. Gordon asks him to leave, and goes to sleep.\n\nGordon is woken by Nancy, who informs him that it’s “MRI Day”. To cope with his claustrophobia, he thinks about a past sailing trip with Roger (\"Sitting Becalmed in the Lee of Cuttyhunk\"). Dr. Berensteiner tells Gordon that he has an arteriovenous malformation, and needs a \"Craniotomy\". Nancy D. informs him of the risks - if he doesn't go through with the operation, he could die, however, if Dr. Berensteiner is not exact with his surgery, he could also die. Gordon, given the choice by the Doctor, decides to go through with the operation, and Roger offers to sleep with Gordon that night (\"An Invitation to Sleep In My Arms\"). Rhoda arrives with news that Mr. Bungee needs a new song by the next morning, so Gordon declines Roger's offer and decides to write instead. He then hallucinates about Lisa, who he encountered earlier on his way to lunch with Rhoda. Lisa implores the audience for \"Change\", both physical money and social change. Gordon presents his new song, \"Yes\", to Mr. Bungee, who hates it, storming off to leave Gordon dejected \"In the Middle of the Room\". Mimi cleans Gordon's apartment, and in a rage, throws out all of his books (\"Throw It Out\"). Gordon waits anxiously as his surgery is delayed (\"In the Middle of the Room (Part 2)\"). Then the operation commences. \n\nRoger, distraught about the surgery, encounters Lisa, who consoles him (\"A Really Lousy Day in the Universe\"). In a coma, Gordon hallucinates a surreal mini-opera featuring people from his life (\"Brain Dead\", \"Whenever I Dream\", \"Eating Myself Up Alive\", \"The Music Still Plays On\"), concluding with a friendly Mr. Bungee telling Gordon “Don’t Give In”, leading him back to consciousness. Dr. Berensteiner celebrates the successful surgery (\"Craniotomy (Reprise)\"). Gordon and Roger fool around in the hospital shower, much to Richard's dismay (\"You Boys Are Gonna Get Me In Such Trouble\"). Gordon expresses his new appreciation for life (\"Sailing (Reprise)\"). \n\nMonths later, Gordon has recovered and is enjoying a new, more fulfilled life with Roger. They run into Lisa, who is selling Gordon's books that Mimi threw out. Gordon and Roger ask for them back, but she refuses (\"The Homeless Lady's Revenge\"). She flees, leaving Gordon furious, but Roger calms him down (\"Time\"). Gordon has apparently overcome his fear of dying with his greatest songs inside him (\"Time and Music\"). With his life at last in balance, he is able to write again and finishes the spring song (\"I Feel so Much Spring\").\n\n\n\" *Not included in the Original Cast Recording\"<br>\n\" +Not included in the 2015 City Center Revival\"\n\nBen Brantley, in his review for \"The New York Times\", wrote: \"The problem is that for Mr. Finn (and probably, alas, for most people), happiness is definitely a blander muse than anxiety. \"A New Brain,\" which has been directed with wit and elegance by Graciela Daniele, has moments of captivating eccentricity. But watching it is often like passing a group of animated, slightly drunken revelers on the street: you're glad they have something to celebrate, but it's a private party, and you walk on by with a faint smile. Mr. Finn originally conceived what became \"A New Brain\" as a series of revue numbers, and it might have worked better in that format. As a story, shaped by Mr. Finn and his longtime collaborator, James Lapine, the show has a spliced-together feeling, a disjunctive quality at odds with the holistic spirit it seems to be aiming for.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2145418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145418", "title": "Dorothy Round", "text": "Dorothy Round\n\nDorothy Edith Round (13 July 1909 – 12 November 1982), was a British tennis player who was active from the late 1920s until 1950. She achieved her major successes in the 1930s. She won the singles title at Wimbledon in 1934 and 1937, and the singles at the Australian Championships in 1935. She also had success as a mixed doubles player at Wimbledon, winning a total of three titles. After her wedding in 1937, she played under her married name, Mrs D.L. Little. During the Second World War, she played in North America and became a professional coach in Canada and the United States. Post-war, she played in British regional tournaments, coached, and wrote on tennis for newspapers.\n\nDorothy Round was born on 13 July 1909 in Dudley, Worcestershire, England, the youngest of four children. She was the child of John Benjamin Round, a building contractor, and Maude Helena. Her family home in Park Road, Dudley, included a hard tennis court laid down by her grandfather. She was brought up as a Methodist and her religion remained important to her throughout her life. According to an interview she gave in later life, she played tennis with her brothers at the court in the garden of the family home from an early age and entered a school tennis competition aged 10 or 11. Round attended the Dudley Girls High School.\n\nRound entered her first tennis tournament when she was 16 when she appeared at a competition held at Pwllheli, in Wales. In September 1925, Round entered the junior Worcestershire championships, and on 7 September 1925 she won the title, defeating Miss Lily Darby of Smethwick in straight sets. She retained the Worcestershire singles junior title the following year and added the doubles title at the same tournament. In September 1926, Round competed in the Junior Tennis Championships at Wimbledon, where she reached the semi-finals. In June 1927, Round won three titles at the Worcestershire County Lawn Tennis Tournament, becoming the singles, doubles and mixed doubles champion.\n\nRound entered her first Wimbledon Championships in 1928, after coming through the qualifying event, and was knocked out in the first round by Miss N. Trentham, the score being 6–2, 6–8, 8–6. The following year she suffered from nerves as she was defeated by Betty Nuthall in the second round. Later in 1929, her picture featured in the \"Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News\" where she was billed as \"a rising player\". Round put in some impressive performances at the Wightman Cup trials held at Wimbledon in April 1930, defeating a number of established British players. In the same month, one of the top British male players, \"Bunny\" Austin called Round \"a Bright new star\". \n\nIn 1930 she made her first tennis trip abroad, to the French Championships where she entered the doubles event, partnered by Mrs. Holcroft Watson and the mixed doubles event, partnered by Mr H.G.N. Lee. Her participation in the tournament resulted in a number of newspapers commenting on the possible difficulties caused by Round's refusal to play on Sunday because of her religious principles and the fact that the finals of the French Championships were played on that day. She reached the semi-finals of the doubles, where the English pair were beaten by the French pair Mathieu and Barbier, 7–5, 7–5. She also reached the third round of the mixed doubles. In this year it was reported that she was being coached by Dan Maskell.\n\nAt the 1931 Wimbledon Championships she reached the quarterfinal stage for the first time after defeating fifth-seeded Lili Álvarez in the third round and was rewarded with a spot on the British team for the Wightman Cup, the annual women's team tennis competition between Great Britain and the United States, which in 1931 was held in August at Forest Hills. She lost her singles match against Anna Harper in three sets after failing to convert any of her seven matchpoints. Later in the same month, Round reached the doubles final of the U.S. National Championships at Forest Hill, where she was partnered by Helen Jacobs. The pair went on to lose to Miss Betty Nuthall and Mrs. Fearnley Whittingstall, the score being 6–2, 6–4. In a newspaper article from 1935, Round stated that it was her Wightman Cup loss that prompted her have more tournament play and she increased the number of tournaments that she played in to around 12 per season.\n\nIn 1932 she again reached the Wimbledon singles quarterfinal in which she was decisively beaten by first-seeded and three-time Wimbledon champion Helen Wills Moody, 6–0, 6–1.\n\nShe declined to compete in the French Championships in 1933, as she did not want to play on a Sunday because of her religious convictions.\n\nIn May 1933, Round scored a victory over Helen Jacobs in the final of the British Hard Court Championships, the score being 3–6, 6–2, 6–3. At the 1933 Wimbledon Championships she was seeded no. 2 and after a win against Helen Jacobs in the semifinal, she reached her first Grand Slam final. Wills Moody, now five-time Wimbledon singles title-holder, proved too strong but Round managed to take a set from her, which was the first set Wills Moody lost in a Grand Slam final since 1925. She proceeded with a tour to the United States where she competed in the 1933 Wightman Cup and won the singles title at the Eastern Grass Court Championships in Rye, beating compatriot Mary Heeley in the final. The result of the match, held on 12 August 1933, was: 6–2, 6–4. Round competed in the 1933 Pacific Coast Championships, held in San Francisco, and was a runner-up to Alice Marble in the singles event but won the doubles event partnering Mary Heeley. In February and March 1934, Round travelled with a British team to the Jamaican Tennis Championships. She reached the singles final but was beaten by Helen Jacobs, 6–4, 6–1. In the following May, Round retained her British Hard Court Championships single title in Bournemouth, beating Peggy Scriven in the final.\n\nSeeded number 2 in the 1934 Wimbledon Championships, she went on to win the tournament, defeating the sixth seeded player, Lolette Payot, in the quarter-finals and the eighth seed, Simonne Mathieu, in the semis, before beating Helen Jacobs in three sets: 6–2, 5–7, 6–3 to take the title. She also won the mixed doubles competition, partnered by the Japanese player, Ryuki Miki.\n\nIn late 1934, Round was part of a British team that sailed to Australasia, arriving at Auckland on 2 November 1934 on board the \"Mariposa\". After playing matches in New Zealand, the British team moved on to Australia in mid-November, where they were given a reception by the New South Lawn Tennis Association on 19 November 1934.\nRound won the Victorian Championships, held in Melbourne, in December 1934 after a two-sets win in the final against Joan Hartigan. In January 1935, Round added the Australian Championships title to her Wimbledon one, beating her British compatriot, Nancy Lyle, in the three set final, the score being 6–1, 1–6, 6–1. With this victory, Round became the first overseas player to win the Australian Championships.\n\nAlso in January 1935, her first instructional book on tennis, \"Modern Lawn Tennis\", was published by George Newnes. \n\nRound lost her Wimbledon singles title in the summer of 1935, defeated in the quarter-finals by the Australian, Joan Hartigan, 6–4, 4–6, 3–6. However, she retained her mixed doubles title in that year, partnered by Fred Perry. The pair beat the Australians, Nell Hopman and Harry Hopman, the score being 7–5, 4–6, 6–2. In July 1935, it was reported that she had taken a post as a dress designer and sports wear adviser to a firm of outfitters. \n\nDespite being the top seed in the singles of the Wimbledon Championships of summer 1936, Round went out at the quarter-final stage, beaten by the German player, Hilde Sperling. This match generated some controversy, when, during play, Round broke a shoulder strap. When Round requested permission to leave court to change, her opponent Sperling replied that she would prefer to keep on playing in case she got cold whilst waiting, forcing Round to carry on with the strap held by a safety pin. Despite the singles loss, Round retained her mixed doubles title, again partnered by Fred Perry. The pair defeated Don Budge and Sarah Fabyan, 7–9, 7–5, 6–4. \nIn July 1936, a \"lawn tennis experiment\" was staged in the form of a match between Round and a top male player Bunny Austin. The match undertaken on \"handicap terms\" ended even at one set all.\n\nIn early 1937, Round was appointed to the National Advisory Council of Physical Fitness, tasked with improving the fitness of the nation.\n\nHer second and final Wimbledon singles title came on 3 July 1937 when she defeated the Polish player Jadwiga Jędrzejowska 6–2, 2–6, 7–5.\n\nAccording to A. Wallis Myers of \"The Daily Telegraph\" and the \"Daily Mail\", Little was ranked in the world top ten from 1933 through 1937, reaching a career high of World No. 1 in 1934.\n\nFollowing her marriage in September 1937 and birth of her son in July 1938, Round took a break from tennis competition. In January 1938, Round's second instructional book, \"Tennis for Girls\" was published. In August 1938, Round presented a trophy that she, herself, had donated to the winner of the women's singles of the Pwllheli tennis tournament. In December 1938, it was reported that Round was planning a come-back to competitive tennis, although she stated that her participation at Wimbledon would be dependent on the progress she made during the year. She returned to tennis in 1939, appearing at the Herga Club's Tournament in Harrow at the end of March. She won her first tournament after her comeback on 13 April 1939, winning the Tally Ho! club's Easter tournament. Later in the year she reached the fourth round in the singles and the third round of the doubles at Wimbledon. In August 1939, playing as Mrs Little at the Pwllheli Tennis Tournament, she won the Dorothy Round Challenge Cup.\n\nIn May 1940, Round won the doubles, partnered by Mrs. S. H. Hammersley, at the Priory Lawn Tennis Tournament held at Edgbaston, Birmingham. In July 1940, Round announced that she was planning to go to Canada with her young son and that she was considering turning \"pro\" and doing some coaching.\n\nIn July 1940, Round went to Canada with her two-year old son, Ian, and whilst there she became a professional tennis coach. She also took part in competitions, exhibition matches and raised money for charity in Canada and the USA as well as promote the sale of War Bonds in the U.S.\n\nIn August 1940, Round won both the singles and doubles (partnered by Mrs Ross Harrington) in the Eastern Canada Championships held at Halifax, Novia Scotia.\n\nRound turned professional in 1941, when she accepted a summer coaching position at the Seigniory Tennis Club in Canada. On 19 November of the same year, Round appeared in an exhibition match together with Mary Hardwick at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina. \n\nIn February 1942, Round was living on the campus of Lake Erie College where she was coaching tennis players. She took over the coaching post from Mary Browne, who had decided to carry out civil defence work.\n\nIn June 1942, Round appeared with Mary Hardwick, Bobby Riggs and Wayne Sabin in a tennis exhibition held at the Edgemoor Club, Washington D.C. The event was to raise money for the British and American Ambulance Corps. At the event, Round was introduced to Dwight Davis, founder of the Davis Cup.\n\nIn 1944, Round returned to the UK, where she performed exhibition matches.. She was reinstated as an amateur in 1945 by the Lawn Tennis Association. There was speculation that she would make a return to Wimbledon in 1946, although, according to the contemporary player and sports journalist, John Olliff, former professionals could not appear at the Wimbledon Championships or at national championships organised under the jurisdiction of the International Lawn Tennis Association. However, Round remained an active tennis player, and after a break in 1946 when she had her second child, she continued to appear in British tournaments to the end of the 1940s and beyond. In June 1947 it was announced that she would be covering the Wimbledon Championships for the regional paper, the Liverpool Daily Post. In August 1947, she appeared at the Scottish Hard Court Championships reaching the final of the singles and winning the doubles and mixed doubles titles. In July 1948, she appeared at the Midlands Counties Championship in Birmingham where she lost the singles final to Barbara Knapp. In September 1949, Round was part of the Worcestershire team playing in the Inter-Counties Hard Court Tournament against a South Wales team. Round reached the third round of the singles in the Midland Counties Championships held in Birmingham, in 1950.\n\nIn the 1953 and 1954, Round wrote articles for regional British newspapers, including a regular column named \"Dorothy Round on Tennis\". \n\nIn 1963, Round coached tennis at Camp Aloha in Vermont. In the following year, she was coaching tennis at Halesowen Grammar School.\n\nShe was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\nOn 20 September 2013 her hometown of Dudley commemorated her by erecting a bronze statue in Priory Park, Dudley. The lifesize bronze statue, unveiled by her daughter, was created by the British sculptor John McKenna and depicts Dorothy Round making a return play of the ball. Also a portrait in oil on canvas by Dudley artist Philip Guest is part of the permanent collection of Dudley Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nDorothy Round's Methodist beliefs were very important to her and she continued to teach at a Methodist Sunday School in Dudley even at the height of her fame when she became Wimbledon champion in 1934. It was also reported in 1934 that she was regularly at the baby welfare centre at Dudley, where she helped local mothers with babies. On 2 September 1937 she married Dr Douglas Leigh Little, a medical practitioner, at the Wesley Methodist Church in Dudley. The bridesmaid was the tennis player Mary Heeley and the wedding dress was designed by Ted Tinling, who later became famous for creating sportswear for many of the post-war ladies' tennis champions. In July 1938, Round gave birth to a boy in Dudley. She went to Canada with her baby son in 1940, returning to the UK in 1944. She gave birth to a daughter, Patricia, in 1946. After Round's tennis playing career ended in 1950, she became a keen golf player and played in golf tournaments during the 1950s. On 4 April 1958, Round's husband died at their home in St. James Road, Dudley. In August 1958, she was appointed a J.P. in her home town of Dudley. Dorothy Round died on 12 November 1982, aged 74, in Kidderminster.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2145426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145426", "title": "Recovery International", "text": "Recovery International\n\nRecovery International (formerly Recovery, Inc., often referred to simply as Recovery or RI) is a mental health self-help organization founded in 1937 by neuropsychiatrist Abraham Low in Chicago, Illinois. Recovery's program is based on self-control, self-confidence, and increasing one's determination to act. Recovery deals with a range of people, all of whom have difficulty coping with everyday problems, whether or not they have a history of psychiatric hospitalization. It is non-profit, secular, and although it uses methods devised by Low, most groups are currently led by experienced non-professionals.\n\n In 1937 Abraham Low was on the faculty at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and participants in Recovery were limited to those who had been hospitalized in the Psychiatric Institute at the University. The original thirty-seven founding members had recovered their mental health after receiving insulin shock treatments at the Institute. Low began the groups as part of an attempt to improve the patient's care following discharge from his hospital. In the early years of the organization he encouraged members to advocate for improvements in social policies regarding state mental health regulations. Following backlash from the medical community to these efforts, Low disbanded the group in 1941. His patients, however, asked to be trained to teach Recovery's methods to others and in 1942 Low began to teach members to lead groups in their homes.\n\nThe organization separated from the Psychiatric Institute in 1942, operating out of private offices in Chicago. New membership at this time was drawn largely from patients in Low's private psychiatry practice. During the first years following its separation Low remained in close contact with all Recovery groups and received regular reports from group leaders. As the membership and number of meetings grew, it made this level of cooperation with the groups untenable. In 1952, Low allowed expansion of Recovery outside of Illinois, giving control of local groups to former patients who had become group leaders. Following Low's death in 1954, Recovery transitioned completely from a professionally run treatment adjunct, to a peer-run self-help group.\n\nEffective January 1, 2007 Recovery, Inc. formally changed its name to Recovery International. On January 1, 2008 Recovery International Merged with The Abraham Low Institute and provisionally renamed the new organization Recovery International / The Abraham Low Institute (RI/TALI). On January 1, 2009, Abraham Low Self-Help Systems was incorporated to umbrella several new programs, and the group continues operations as Recovery International and Abraham Low Self-Help Systems in various states and internationally.\n\nThe causes and classification of mental illnesses are considered irrelevant in the Recovery method. Recovery members are simply viewed as people who have developed disturbing symptom-reactions leading to ill-controlled behavior. Symptoms are threatening sensations; including feelings, impulses, and obsessive thoughts. The phrase, \"symptomatic idiom\" describes the mental association of danger with symptoms.\n\nThe symptomatic idiom implies that there is an impending catastrophe of physical collapse, mental collapse, or permanent handicap. In the first instance, for example, a person may consider heart palpitations as signaling that sudden death is imminent, or that a painful headache is caused by a brain tumor; phobias, compulsions, and ruminations would eventually cause a mental collapse. The fear of permanent handicap insists that there is no cure or relief for one's mental illness and that recovery is impossible.\n\nTemper is a combination of a feeling and a judgment about oneself or others. The feeling is related to one of the two types of temper, fear or anger. The judgment is that one has been wronged by another, or that one has done something wrong. \"Fearful temper\" arises from thoughts that one has made a mistake (has done something wrong) which in turn causes feelings such as fear, shame and inadequacy. \"Angry temper\" results from the belief that one has been wronged which in turn creates feelings of indignation and impatience. There is a two-way relationship between temper and symptoms. Symptoms induce emotions such as fear and anger, which in turn induce temper, which increases the intensity of the symptoms.\n\n\"Temperamental lingo\" describes language related to judgments of right and wrong, and the use of defeatist language when discussing symptoms. When discussing symptoms, temperamental lingo includes the use of adjectives such as \"intolerable,\" \"uncontrollable,\" \"unbearable,\" and similar language that places an emphasis on the dangerous and fatalistic implications of feelings, impulses, or thoughts.\n\nFree will is fundamental to Recovery's method. The subconscious, as it is known in psychoanalysis, as well as viewpoints emphasizing unconscious motivations, drives, and instincts are considered to be self-defeating. Recovery considers adults as capable of behaving based on deliberate plans, settled decisions, reasoned conclusions and firm determinations. Will gives adults the ability to accept or reject thoughts and impulses. Recovery members achieve mental health by training their Wills to reject self-defeating thoughts and impulses, countering them with self-endorsing thoughts and wellness-promoting actions.\n\nRecovery distinguishes between the External Environment, the realities of a situation, and the Internal Environment, one's own subjective feelings, thoughts, impulses, and sensations. Two components of the Internal Environment, thoughts and impulses, can be directly controlled by Will. Control of thoughts and impulses allows indirect control over sensations and feelings. For instance, thoughts of insecurity and anxiousness can be replaced with thoughts of security. Similarly, a feeling of fear can be disposed by removing the associated belief of danger (symptomatic idiom). While the Internal Environment can be changed with cognitive reframing, changing one's External Environment may or may not be possible.\n\nRecovery focuses on treating former mental patients, sometimes referred to as postpsychotic persons, as well as psychoneurotic persons. The latter group is most often referred to as \"nervous\" or \"nervous patients\". Recovery members may refer to themselves as \"nervous patients\" regardless of whether they are being treated by a physician or other professional. Sociologist Edward Sagarin described this as a compromise between the term neurotic and the more colloquial phrase \"nervous breakdown\".\n\nRecovery encourages members to cognitively reframe their experiences using several techniques. Spotting, reframing defeatist language, self-endorsement and creating Examples are the most commonly cited in scholarly reviews of Recovery.\n\nSpotting is an introspective relabeling of thoughts and symptoms. When a thought arises related to angry temper, fearful temper, or associating danger with a symptom it must be spotted and reframed. Members practice spotting and reacting appropriately to the distressing thought or symptom.\n\nRecovery developed its own language for labeling psychiatric symptoms and responding to them. This language is centered around two concepts, \"authority\" and \"sabotage.\" It is suggested that members rely on the authority of a physician's diagnosis with respect to their symptoms. For instance, if a member self-diagnoses a headache as being caused by a brain tumor, but a physician has diagnosed it otherwise, then the member is said to be sabotaging the physician's authority. This is similarly true for the member's prognosis, if a member despairs that their condition is hopeless, but a physician has found the prognosis to be good, this is also sabotage of the physician's authority. Using the physician's perspective to reframe defeatist thoughts is intended to help members recognize that they have not lost control, and their situation can be coped with.\n\nMembers practice self-endorsement of every effort made to use a Recovery method, no matter how small and regardless of the outcome. In this way, similar subsequent efforts will require less work and are more likely to be successful. Similarly members are taught to change their behavior in \"part acts\" (small steps), to simply \"move their muscles\" to complete tasks, however small, to eventually complete larger overwhelming tasks.\n\nThe Example format was created by Low as a means to allow Recovery to function as a stand-alone lay self-help group that would not require professional supervision. Members create Examples by following a four-part outline, each part requiring a description.\n\nExamples are a formalized way to practice the Recovery program. A successful outcome is not required to create an Example, as all attempts at practicing Recovery methods are endorsed.\n\nDuring the first fifteen years of Recovery, Low required members to attend classes and meetings for at least six months at a cost of ten dollars per month, not including the membership dues of two dollars per year. Members would meet at least three days a week and on Wednesdays take part in panel discussions as panelists or audience members held at a private home. Panel discussions would consist of three to four panelists with considerable experience in Recovery discussing a topic from Low's literature, focusing on spotting and conquering symptoms. Dr. Low would address the audience at the end of each panel discussion summing up the discussion and correcting any misinformation given about Recovery. Every Thursday Low would conduct a group psychotherapy class for Recovery members.\n\nNo meetings were held between Saturday and Wednesday. Commonly, novice members would have a \"setback,\" a relapse of psychiatric symptoms, during this time. As setbacks were considered unavoidable, the novice members were assigned to a more experienced member to call or visit should they need assistance. If the assistance provided by the experienced member was not helpful, they could contact a chairperson in their area (a member who functioned like the physician's deputy), and if that was still not satisfactory they could contact the physician, Dr. Low.\n\nAt the meetings, members share examples from their lives that caused nervous symptoms, the thoughts that occurred just beforehand, how they spotted them and reacted to them. Other members offer alternative ways of looking at the situation and suggest how to better handle similar symptoms in the future. Meetings range in size from 6 to 30 members and follow a rigid schedule to ensure adherence to Recovery methods. Each meeting has a leader in a permanent position; leadership duties do not rotate from meeting to meeting. Each meeting is split into five parts. Members introduce themselves by first name only, as is practiced in Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\nThe beginning of a meeting is generally reserved for reading from Recovery literature. Members take turns reading sections of a chapter or article. Group leaders will often call on new members during this period, or members who are hesitant to volunteer. After finishing a paragraph a group leader will often ask a member if they experienced any symptoms while reading the literature and will endorse them for the efforts to continue reading despite feelings of discomfort or fear of making mistakes.\n\nOnly members who have read \"Mental Health Through Will Training\" are allowed to participate in this portion of the meeting. Those participating form a \"panel\" although they are usually seated face-to-face around a table. The group leader reminds the members that examples should be constructed around day-to-day events as Recovery is a non-professional organization and cannot help people with major problems. This statement is qualified, however, with Low's opinion that the majority of a nervous patient's problems are related to \"trivial\" incidents. Rather than being a limitation of Recovery's program, this is intended to be a novel treatment approach. A day-today trivial event may generalize to other problems experienced by the member. Discussion of trivialities is less threatening than complex problems, making a discussion of coping mechanisms possible.\n\nA survey of groups in Chicago in 1971 and 1977 found that most examples presented were stories of successful application of the Recovery method, less than ten percent represented \"problem examples\" where the application was not successful.\n\nAfter an Example has been given, the meeting is opened for \"group spotting\". During this period other members of the panel are allowed to comment on the Example based on Recovery principles. This group leader usually makes the first comments, and if there are no volunteers to continue, he or she may call on panel members to provide commentary. Comments not based on Recovery's concepts or not related to the example are stopped by the group leader. Comments are either classed as positive, praise for application of a Recovery method, or negative, related to an instance where a method was not applied. An Example rarely passes without mention of additional Recovery techniques that could be applied to it. This serves as a constant reminder that Recovery's method can never be practiced perfectly; members can always learn from experience and benefit from group practice.\n\nFor example, a person may experience \"lowered feelings\" (depression) because they are aiming for a perfect performance. Trying to be perfect or trying to appear perfect leads one to feel down if one makes even the slightest mistake. All improvements, no matter how small, are acknowledged and members are encouraged to endorse themselves for their efforts—not for their successes. Longstanding members are encouraged to share their success with the Recovery methods to help newcomers. Low saw the sharing of successes by veteran members as an essential component of meetings, as it demonstrates that distressing sensations can be endured, impulses can be controlled, and obsessions can be checked.\n\nFollowing the panel presentation, about fifteen minutes are set aside for a question and answer period. Any member may ask a question of the panel during this time, newcomers are especially encouraged to participate. Discussion, however, must be limited to the Examples given and related Recovery concepts. Discussion questioning Recovery's method is not allowed. Discussion of psychological theories outside of Recovery is similarly discouraged. In a case where a member brings up a disagreement between his physician and a Recovery concept, he or she is told that the panel is not qualified to provide an answer not related to the Examples presented. Members are expected to follow the advice of their professional; Recovery is not intended as a substitute for psychiatric services, but a self-directed program that can be used as an adjunct to professional treatment, or alone when professional treatment is not available.\n\nThe formal meeting ends with the question and answer period, and an informal \"mutual-aid\" gathering usually follows. During this time refreshments are usually served. Members may speak freely with one another and discuss problems or ask for advice, although there is an attempt to keep the discussion within the bounds of Recovery concepts. By convention, discussion of problems are limited to five minutes in an attempt to discourage self-pity and complaining.\n\nThe results here are from a 1960 survey of groups in Chicago and Michigan. 1,875 surveys were sent; the results are based on the 779 that were returned.\n\nThe 1960 survey of members found participation in Recovery to be a regular and long-term activity. About one-third of the respondents had been in Recovery for less than a year, another third had been in Recovery for one to two years, and another third had participated for two years or more. Most members reported attending meetings weekly, although one-third reported that they no longer needed to attend meetings to function adequately. Observation of meetings in Chicago during 1971 and 1977 found the average member attended only about 37% of meetings, and also found that it was common for newcomers to only attend one meeting and never return.\n\nRecovery does not have a graduation or discharge procedure for members. There is a conflicting goal in Recovery in that while it is intended to rehabilitate members, it also needs to sustain itself to continue this goal, creating a potential danger that rehabilitation of members may be subverted by efforts to maintain the organization's membership. Professional treatment goals, however, generally emphasize the importance of adherence to therapeutic practices. The concern is more commonly that patients will not follow through with them, rather than that they will never stop practicing them.\n\nAccording to the 1960 survey, most Recovery respondents are middle-aged, middle-class, female and married with an employed spouse. A survey of members from 1971 and 1977 estimated the mean age of members to be 49 years, and found that most of them were lower middle-class or working class. In contrast, studies of similar groups found most members had never been married, but similar to a specific study of Emotions Anonymous that found most of the members were middle class. Other studies of self-help groups for people with serious mental illness found most of the members were unemployed, while others found members to be predominately working class. A ratio of two (or more) females for every male is common in studies of self-help groups for persons with serious mental illness.\n\nThe 1960 survey found few members with extensive histories of treatment for mental illness prior to joining Recovery. Half of the respondents reported no previous hospitalization, and about one-fifth had never been treated professionally for a mental illness. Members who reported being hospitalized reported very few instances of short duration. More recent studies have shown that in self-help groups for serious mental illness, approximately 60% (55–75%) of members had been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons.\n\nMost respondents to the 1960 survey reported having heard of Recovery in the lay press, and joined at the suggestion of a friend or relative. Just one-tenth of the respondents reported having been referred by a physician. They reported joining because of psychological symptoms (fears, delusions, and \"nerves\"), psychosomatic symptoms (tremors and heart palpitations) and also out of curiosity to see if the organization would help. A survey of members from 1971 and 1977 also found that most members were self-referred.\n\nFrom 1952 to 2008, Recovery was run from its office in Chicago by a twelve-member Board of Directors, a number of committees, organization officers, and a full-time paid administrative staff. The Board of Directors was elected at Recovery's annual meeting and served for a period of three years. Authority from the Board of Directors was passed to Area Leaders then to Assistant Area Leaders, District Leaders, and lastly to Group Leaders. Leaders are trained to run Recovery meetings, but are not considered experts or authorities. Policies and practices of Recovery were made by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn the early years of Recovery, an event was held on Saturday afternoons at Recovery's office in Chicago for Recovery members as well as their relatives and friends. Later, family and friends of members were allowed to attend meetings, although not to participate. In 1943 Low published a book, \"Lectures to Relatives of Former Patients\" to help assist them with the recovery effort; this information was later reprinted in \"Peace Versus Power in the Family: Domestic Discord and Emotional Distress\" in 1967.\n\nIn 1945, Abraham Low found the average member improved considerably after the first or second week in the program as it existed at that time. However, members were required to lose their major symptoms within two months of membership and class attendance. If they did not, this was taken as an indication that the member was still sabotaging the physician's efforts.\n\nA 1984 study found that following participation in Recovery, former mental patients reported no more anxiety about their mental health than the general public. Members rated their life satisfaction levels as high, or higher, than the general public. Members who had participated two years or more reported the highest levels of satisfaction with their health. Members who participated for less than two years tended to still be taking medication and living below the poverty level with smaller social networks.\n\nA 1988 study found that participation in Recovery decreased members' symptoms of mental illness and the amount of psychiatric treatment needed. About half of the members had been hospitalized before joining. Following participation, less than 8% had been hospitalized. Members' scores of neurotic distress decreased, and scores of psychological well-being for longstanding members were no different from members of a control group in the same community. Long-term members were being treated with less psychiatric medication and psychotherapy than newer members.\n\nRecovery's methods have been compared to several psychotherapies. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hortonville Education Ass’n\", 426 U.S. 482, 488 (1976) (“We are, of course, bound to accept the interpretation of [State] law by the highest court of the State.”). Thus, generally speaking, the U.S. Supreme Court has the authority (“jurisdiction”) to review state court determinations of federal law, but lacks jurisdiction to review state court determinations of state law. \"See\" 28 U.S.C. § 1257.\n\nThis general rule is simple to apply in cases clearly involving only one body of law. If that law is federal, then the U.S. Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the state court judgment; if it is state law, then it does not. However, because litigants can (and often do) raise federal claims in state courts, many cases are not so simple, and this general rule breaks down. Indeed, state courts often dismiss cases raising federal claims because they fail to comply with state-law procedures, and in some cases federal and state law are not clearly distinct; instead they are intertwined. The adequate and independent state ground doctrine provides certain exceptions to this general rule and guides the U.S. Supreme Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over these complex cases.\n\nThe adequate and independent state ground doctrine states that when a litigant petitions the U.S. Supreme Court to review the judgment of a state court which rests upon both federal and non-federal (state) law, the U.S. Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction over the case if the state ground is (1) “adequate” to support the judgment, and (2) “independent” of federal law. \"See Michigan v. Long\", 463 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1983) (“It is, of course, incumbent upon this Court to ascertain for itself whether the asserted non-federal ground independently and adequately supports the judgment.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); \"Fox Film Corp. v. Muller\", 296 U.S. 207, 210 (1935) (“[W]here the judgment of a state court rests upon two grounds, one of which is federal and the other non-federal in character, our jurisdiction fails if the non-federal ground is independent of the federal ground and adequate to support the judgment.”); \"Murdock v. City of Memphis\", (\"[W]hether there exist other matters in the record actually decided by the State court which are sufficient to maintain the judgment of that court, notwithstanding the error in deciding the Federal question. In [that case] the court would not be justified in reversing the judgment of the State court.\").\n\nThe “adequacy” prong primarily focuses on state court dismissals of federal claims on state procedural grounds, as procedural requirements are by definition logically antecedent. Antecedent state-law grounds (i.e., state rules of procedure) are adequate to support a judgment unless they (1) are arbitrary, unforeseen, or otherwise deprive the litigant of a reasonable opportunity to be heard, \"see, e.g., Staub v. City of Baxley\", 355 U.S. 313, 319-20 (1958), or (2) impose an undue burden on the ability of litigants to protect their federal rights, \"see, e.g., Felder v. Casey\", 487 U.S. 131, 138 (1988).\n\nThe “independence” prong focuses on decisions where the state and federal rules are not clearly distinct. If it is not \"apparent from the four corners” of the opinion that the judgment rests on an independent state law rule, then, unless it is “necessary or desirable” to obtain clarification from the state court itself, the Supreme Court will presume that the decision rested in part on federal law, thereby rendering it reviewable. \"Michigan v. Long\", 463 U.S. 1032, 1040 & n.6. Furthermore, when federal law limits the states’ ability to change the definition of state-created legal interests, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the state court’s characterization of the law both before and after the change. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court routinely reviews state court determinations of state property law to determine whether a litigant has been deprived of “property” within the meaning of the Due Process clause.\n\n\n"}

Leona Schillera w Łodzi) is the leading Polish academy for future actors, directors, photographers, camera operators and TV staff. It was founded on 8 March 1948 in Łódź and was initially planned to be moved to Warsaw as soon as the city was rebuilt after its destruction during World War II and the Warsaw Uprising. However, in the end the school remained in Łódź and is one of the most prominent institutions of higher education in the city.\n\nUntil 1958 the school existed as two separate schools: one for actors and the other for filmmakers. The schools and the Polish cinema industry were moved from Warsaw to the nearby city of Łódź after World War II. This move was initially seen as a temporary measure, thus the name of the actors' school was \"The National Higher School of Theatre in Warsaw with seat in Łódź\". Its creator and the first rector was the renowned Polish actor Leon Schiller, current namesake of the school. In 1949 it was divided into two branches; one actually moved to Warsaw and the other one remained in Łódź under the directorship of Kazimierz Dejmek (since 1950).\n\nThe years leading up to the merger in 1958 were those in which notable artists of the Polish Film School created the reputation of the Łódź Film School as the most liberal and least Communist institution of higher education in Poland. Among the most notable alumni of that period were Andrzej Munk, Janusz Morgenstern, Andrzej Wajda and Kazimierz Kutz. In 1954 they were joined by Roman Polanski.\n\nAfter 1958 the school became one of the most notable cultural think-tanks of Poland, with many outsiders and artists not supported by the Communist authorities joining it. Various discussion clubs and relative liberty of speech promoted by the new rector, Jerzy Toeplitz, added to its value. For instance, two of the students of the university (Jerzy Matuszkiewicz and Witold Sobociński) became the first jazz musicians in Poland after World War II to be allowed by the authorities to organize a concert. Kirk Douglas visited the school in 1966. His visit was documented in \"Kirk Douglas\" the documentary.\n\nAfter the events of March 1968, the period of liberty came to an end. Toeplitz was fired, as were most of the tutors. However, with the advent of Edward Gierek and his regime, the school once again started to bloom.\n\nThe School has three Oscar-winning alumni: Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda and Zbigniew Rybczyński, while alumnus Krzysztof Kieślowski was nominated for an Oscar. Both Polanski and Wajda won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 and 1981, respectively.\n\nThe Internetowa Baza Filmu Polskiego (Polish Internet Movie Database) has been maintained by the School since 1998.\n\n\n"}

Its members carried out surveys of canals and produced reports in support of their retention when much of the canal network was under threat. Following official support for use of the canals for leisure activities in 1967, the Society have concentrated their efforts on the restoration and operation of Bugsworth Basin, located at the southern end of the Peak Forest Canal, which was one of the first canals that they surveyed in 1958.\n\nFollowing the nationalisation of much of the canal network in 1948, and despite official attitudes which often saw the canals only as commercial highways, there had been some progress towards using them for pleasure cruising. On 17 March 1954, the Minister of Transport announced in Parliament that the British Transport Commission would be considering the plight of the network. A Board of Survey, under the chairmanship of Lord Rusholme, prepared the report, which was published in April 1955. This divided the existing canals into three groups. Group 1, consisting of the River Trent, the River Severn, the River Lee Navigation, the River Weaver, the Aire and Calder Navigation and the southern part of the Grand Union Canal, should be retained and improved. This group included just of waterway. A further were included in group 2. This group included most of the narrow canals that still had significant commercial traffic and some wide canals such as the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The report suggested that attempts to increase the commercial traffic on these canals should be made, but that they should be relegated to group 3 if the traffic did not appear. Group 3 canals, which covered all the rest, should be considered for disposal to organisations other than the British Transport Commission or closed. The group included of canal, but about one third of them were already closed, having been abandoned as a result of the LMS General Powers Act of 1945.\n\nThis approach was considered by the Bowes Committee, which published their report, entitled \"The Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Inland Waterways (Cmnd 486)\" in July 1958. This proposed two groups of waterways, Class A and Class B, that were similar to the groups 1 and 2 of the 1954 report, and that all other canals should be developed for purposes that did not include navigation, or should be eliminated.\n\nAmidst fears that there might be little of the canal network left unless urgent action was taken, a number of canal enthusiasts in the East Midlands formed the Inland Waterways Protection Society on 21 April 1958. It was initially a breakaway movement from the Inland Waterways Association (IWA), which at the time was undergoing radical reorganisation to become a non-profit distributing company limited by guarantee. The president was Sir Geoffrey Lowles, who was still a member of the IWA council at the time, and had opposed the reorganisation. Teddy Edwards was its waterways consultant, and Mrs Bessie Bunker of Sheffield became its secretary. She was accused by Robert Aickman, the chairman of the IWA, of being the founder of the new society, and although she rejected the idea, she did admit that it would probably not have been formed without her.\n\nBy the time the Bowes Report was published in July, the IWPS was ready to Act, and immediately started to visit and review the Class C waterways, so that they would have facts to argue the case for retention, and could produce informed reports on their condition. During 1958, they succeeding in covering the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Chesterfield Canal. Reports on the Pocklington Canal, the Macclesfield Canal and the Peak Forest Canal followed in early 1959, and other canals were surveyed subsequently.\n\nIn February 1959, the government admitted that the implementation of the Bowes Report would require extensive legislation, and set up the Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee (IWRAC) to assist in the redevelopment of Class C waterways. Its members included several who were sympathetic to the restoration movement, including the author Tom Rolt. In May 1959 the IWPS organised a protest cruise on the Chesterfield Canal, to try to convince the authorities that it should be retained, and in the following month presented their first report to the IWRAC. It gave detailed arguments for the restoration of the Pocklington Canal, when the Advisory Committee were considering whether it should be filled in and abandoned. Similar reports concerning the future of the Dudley Canal, the Stourbridge Canal and the Titford Branch Canal were presented to the IWRAC in August. Members also began to campaign for the Cromford Canal, with the Leawood Pump House, to be retained.\n\nMembers made a survey of the Ashton Canal during the winter of 1959/60, and began inspecting the Peak Forest Canal in February 1960. This included an assessment of Bugsworth Basin, at the terminus of the canal. Together with an inspection of the Caldon Canal, this work enabled them to present reports on all three canals to IWRAC, which included detailed assessments of ways in which they might be restored both economically and successfully. A forward-looking report for a new canal route between Leeds and London, which would include parts of the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Chesterfield Canal, was presented to the IWRAC on 7 April 1960, and another protest cruise was held on the Chesterfield Canal on 30 April 1960. Despite the work of the society, and recommendations by the IWRAC that they should be retained, the British Transport Commission announced to Parliament in November 1961 that the Chesterfield Canal, the upper Erewash Canal, the Buckingham Branch and the Dudley Canal and Dudley Tunnel would be closed. Both the IWPS and the Inland Waterways Association protested. Ernest Marples, the minister of transport, stated that \"the canals are not viable in their present form,\" and that a proposed authority to oversee them \"may well involve the closure of canals and their conversion or disposal if, thereby, the burden on the tax payer can be relieved.\" As the threats to the network persisted, the initial campaigning by the IWPS was in many cases assisted by local societies representing individual waterways. Thus the Retford and Worksop Boat Club was formed in February 1962 to campaign for the Chesterfield Canal, and the Marple Residents Association worked to get Marple aqueduct repaired and the Peak Forest Canal reopened,\n\nIn 1962, responsibility for the canals passed to a new body, the British Waterways Board, and the IWRAC was abolished. There was considerable debate in the House of Lords as to whether they canals were public or private rights-of-way. If they were private, like the railways, then there was only a responsibility to maintain them for the safety of the public, but if they were public, then there was a responsibility to maintain them for navigation. Ultimately, it was decided that they were public rights-of-way, and this fact was enshrined in the Transport Act 1962. Meanwhile, the IWPS continued to make tours and inspections of canals under threat. Their survey of the Chesterfield Canal in 1964 revealed significant problems at the Chesterfield end. A confectionery factory had been built over the terminal basin, the section from Killamarsh to Spinkhill bridge was dry, and High Moor lock house had been demolished and the rubble pushed into the lock chamber. It would be another three years before officials finally recognised that the canal network had a future besides use for commercial carrying. A White Paper called \"British Waterways: Recreation and Amenity\" was presented to Parliament in September 1967. The Minister for Transport, Barbara Castle, announced that the Government now realised that pleasure cruising was not a pastime confined to the rich, that the British Waterways Board would have a duty to ensure that the canals were suitable for powered pleasure boats, and that of the network would be retained.\n\nThe Peak Forest Canal was one of the first canals surveyed by the newly formed IWPS. At its southern end, the canal splits into two. The line to Whaley Bridge was originally a branch, and the line to Bugsworth Basin was the main line, although this designation has now been reversed. The name of the village has been changed to Buxworth, which is supposedly more desirable, although the basin retains the original spelling. The Bugsworth line was last used for commercial traffic in 1922, and was abandoned in 1925. Since 1968, the main aims of the IWPS have been the restoration and operation of Bugsworth Basin. The society became a non-profit limited company in 1982, and the rift with the Inland Waterways Association, which resulted in the formation of the society in 1958, was resolved in 1995, when the society re-affiliated to the IWA.\n\nOn 14 September 1968, the IWPS received permission from British Waterways to commence restoration of Bugsworth Basin. In 1970, the IWPS was awarded a Bronze Plaque under the Countryside Awards Scheme of the European Conservation Year. On 6 September 1975, the Entrance Basin was re-watered and boats passed into it for the first time in more than 30 years. However, the canal was found to be leaking and it had to be drained shortly afterwards.\n\nOn 18 April 1982, the Entrance Basin was re-watered again to admit boats but the canal was found to be still leaking and it had to be drained once more. In November 1998, a greater area of Bugsworth Basin was re-watered and boats entered again. In April 1999 there was a celebration of the return of boats but once again the canal was found to be leaking and it had to be drained.\n\nFollowing an extensive geological survey of the ground, which included the drilling of core sample for analysis, DewPitchmastic commenced work on sealing the canal in December 2003. In addition to this work, GallifordTry, the omnibus contractor for British Waterways, cleared and then sealed part of the Entrance Canal, to make it watertight, as it was also leaking. The latter work was completed just in time for the Official Opening of Bugsworth Basin on Easter Saturday 2005.\n\nFollowing this successful opening of Bugsworth Basin, the IWPS is still working with British Waterways and others to secure the long-term future of Bugsworth Basin. The IWPS is supported by British Waterways, High Peak Borough Council Derbyshire County Council, the Inland Waterways Association, English Heritage, English Nature, the Waterways Trust, the East Midlands Development Agency, Awards for All, and the Countryside Agency.\n\n"}

These are the second largest Kazakhstani proven reserves after ChevronTexaco's TengizChevroil. Estimated production is of oil per day. In 2005, PetroKazakhstan was acquired by China National Petroleum Corporation and then in 2006 transferred to PetroChina.\n\nFormerly known as Hurricane Hydrocarbons Ltd. the company was founded in 1981 and initially operated in Western Canada. It changed to a more international focus and grew after making several major oil and gas finds in Southern Kazakhstan, in 1991 becoming a partner in a JV to develop the Kyzylkiya, Aryskum, Maibulak and South Kumkol fields.\n\nIn 1996 it purchased Yuzhneftegaz from the Kazakh government, making it one of the largest players in the country.\n\nHowever the company ran into severe problems in the late 1990s. All the company's oil went through refineries owned by Central Asian Industrial Holdings N.V. (CAIH), a Dutch-registered offshore affiliate of Kazkommertsbank (KKB) Kazakhstan's leading banking group, which used their monopoly to charge high prices. At the same time oil prices plunged. In 1999 the company was forced into receivership and almost broken up.\n\nThe company was saved by Bernard Isautier, a board member who had long been involved in the Canadian oil industry and in Central Asia. He became CEO and negotiated a merger with Central Asian Industrial Holdings N.V. From mid-October 1999 to 2000 Hurricane acquired 88.4% of OJSC Shymkentnefteorgsintez (now PetroKazakhstan Oil Products LLP) which owns the 160,000 bpd Shymkent Oil Refinery, the most modern of the country's three refineries (commissioned 1985). In doing so Isautier put 30% of Hurricane's stock in CAIH's hands. This eventually made the investors in both companies very wealthy, especially Isautier who had demanded no salary and was at first only paid in stock options. The rapid increase in the stock's value made Isautier by far the most generously compensated executive in Canada in 2004.\n\nIn 2003 Hurricane was renamed PetroKazakhstan to reflect that its entire operations are in that country.\n\nIn the following years Hurricane/PetroKazakhstan saw considerable conflict with the government of Kazakhstan, including a fine for anti-competitive behaviour and protests of its environmental and labour record reportedly organized by government agents. In June 2005 PetroKazakhstan announced that it had been approached for a possible takeover or merger, sending stock prices up significantly. The most frequently mentioned possible suitor was a branch of India's ONGC. The stock quickly fell back down when the government of Kazakhstan announced that it would demand the right to acquire PetroKazakhstan prior to any merger, in part because India would have to export their oil through Russia, thus increasing Kazakhstan’s dependence on Russia.\n\nOn 21 August 2005 China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), agreed to buy the company for US$4.18 billion via CNPC International Ltd. (CNPCI), a 100% subsidiary of China National Oil & Gas Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC). This made the PetroKazakhstan deal the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company. PetroKazakhstan was delisted in Kazakhstan, Toronto, New York, London and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges.\n\nAs part of the deal with CNPC, on 15 October 2005, according to the \"Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan On Subsoil Use\", CNPC agreed to sell back 33% of the shares of PetroKazakhstan Inc. to KazMunaiGas (KMG), a transaction which was completed on 5 July 2006. Further on 6 July 2007 KMG bought back a 50% share in PetroKazakhstan subsidiary PetroKazakhstan Oil Products LLP [PKOP) thereby allowing the Kazakh government to regain an equal share of the nation's most modern oil refinery.\n\nIn 2006 CNPC transferred its remaining 67% of shares to China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Company (CPECC), a 50/50 joint venture with its own listed subsidiary PetroChina, who currently manage and operate the company.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2145524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145524", "title": "Setting Sons", "text": "Setting Sons\n\nSetting Sons is a 1979 album by British band The Jam, their fourth since their debut in 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart upon the first week of release, continuing the commercial (and critical) favour that had begun with their previous album \"All Mod Cons\".\n\nThe sole single from \"Setting Sons\", \"The Eton Rifles\", became the group's first top 10 UK hit, peaking at No. 3.\n\nIn contrast to its pop-oriented predecessor, \"Setting Sons\" features a much harder, tougher production, albeit with the emphasis on melody common throughout The Jam's discography. Arguably, this is the Jam's most thematically ambitious LP. Singer, guitarist and songwriter Paul Weller originally conceived \"Setting Sons\" as a concept album detailing the lives of three boyhood friends who later reunite as adults after an unspecified war, only to discover they have grown both up and apart. This concept was never fully developed and it remains unclear which tracks were originally intended as part of the story, although it is commonly agreed that \"Thick As Thieves\", \"Little Boy Soldiers\", \"Wasteland\" and \"Burning Sky\" are likely constituents; extant Jam bootlegs feature a version of \"Little Boy Soldiers\" split into three separate recordings, possible evidence that the song was intended to serve as a recurring motif, with separate sections appearing between other songs on the album.\n\nThe album was musically ambitious as well. \"Little Boy Soldiers\" consists of several movements, reminiscent of compositions by The Kinks. \"Wasteland\" unconventionally features a recorder. Even more striking is Bruce Foxton's \"Smithers-Jones\". The song was originally released as the B-side of the non-LP single \"When You're Young\" three months before the album's release; on \"Setting Sons\" it is re-recorded in an all-strings arrangement, save a little electric guitar in the coda. According to the liner notes of the \"Direction Reaction Creation\" box set, the revamping of \"Smithers-Jones\" was suggested by drummer Rick Buckler. \n\nThe liner notes also imply that the album was a somewhat rushed effort, which may explain why the original underlying concept was not fully developed, as well as the inclusion of one cover song and two prior releases: \"Smithers-Jones\" had already been released; \"Heat Wave\" is a cover of the Martha and the Vandellas' Motown hit. Since \"The Eton Rifles\" was released in advance of the LP for promotional purposes, this leaves only seven entirely new original songs on the album.\n\nThe album cover art features a photograph of Benjamin Clemens' bronze sculpture \"The St John's Ambulance Bearers\". Cast in 1919, it depicts a wounded soldier being carried by two ambulance workers. The sculpture is currently in the possession of the Imperial War Museum in London.\n\nThe album remains one of The Jam's most critically favoured works, alongside \"All Mod Cons\" and \"Sound Affects\". The only song particularly singled out for negative criticism is the cover of \"Heat Wave\", which clearly owes more to The Who's arrangement than the original. As AllMusic put it, \"\"Setting Sons\" often reaches brilliance and stands among The Jam's best albums, but the inclusion of a number of throwaways and knockoffs (especially the out-of-place cover of \"Heat Wave\" which closes the album) mars an otherwise perfect album.\" Nonetheless, AllMusic gave the album the full five stars.\n\nIt was ranked at number four among the top \"Albums of the Year\" for 1979 by \"NME\", with \"The Eton Rifles\" and \"Strange Town\" ranked at numbers one and five among the year's top tracks.\n\n\"Setting Sons\" spent 19 weeks on the UK album charts, rising to No. 4. In the U.S., the album spent 8 weeks on the \"Billboard 200\" album charts and reached its peak position of No. 137 in March 1980.\n\nThe 2014 re-release also charted in the UK, reaching No. 97 in November of that year.\n\nThe Polydor Canada LP release of \"Setting Sons\" is substantially different from the original UK version, and contains 12 tracks.\n\nThe Polydor US LP release in 1979 reversed the sides and inserted the single \"Strange Town\" as the second song on side two, between \"Girl on the Phone\" and \"Thick As Thieves\".\n\nAll songs by Paul Weller except as noted.\n\n\n\nAll songs by Paul Weller except as noted.\n\n\nAll songs by Paul Weller except as noted.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tom DeLay, lobbyist, and public relations executive who has pleaded guilty to corruption charges related to the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. He is currently assisting in the investigation of his former partners Abramoff, Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed by separate state and federal grand jury investigations related to the defrauding of American Indian tribes and corruption of public officials. \n\nIn addition to the allegation of dishonest dealing arising from the consulting contracts themselves, Abramoff and Scanlon are accused of illegally giving favors to senior Republicans Tom DeLay, Conrad Burns, John Doolittle, and Bob Ney. In 2005, Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a member of Congress and other public officials. On February 11, 2011, he was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison and 300 hours of community service.\n\nIn 1994, Scanlon worked as press secretary for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ross Pierpont of Maryland. Pierpont failed to gain the party's nomination. Scanlon later acted as a press secretary to Michael Patrick Flanagan (R-IL), who was elected to the former congressional seat of Dan Rostenkowski (D-IL) in 1994, Fred Heineman (R-NC) in 1996, and then Bob Riley (R-AL), who later became Governor of Alabama.\nScanlon later became an aide to congressman Tom DeLay (R-TX), and rose in the ranks to become the Majority Whip's communication director.\n\nMichael Scanlon resigned his position as communication director for Tom DeLay in March 2000, while DeLay was being lobbied by Abramoff to vote against the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. Shortly thereafter, Scanlon was hired by the Washington law firm of Preston Gates Ellis and Rouvelas Meeds, and joined Abramoff's lobbying team.\n\nIn February 2000, Abramoff became involved in the purchase of SunCruz Casinos, a Florida-based cruise line which ran \"cruises to nowhere\" into international waters, where gambling was allowed on board. Scanlon was not a partner in the deal but assisted in the purchase, by contacting Neil G. Volz, an old friend from his time on Capitol Hill and Chief of Staff to Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH). Volz aided Scanlon in getting Ney to place comments in the Congressional Record to aid Abramoff in purchasing the business. Abramoff was accused and later pleaded guilty in 2005 to charges of wire fraud, stemming from a forged wire transfer showing a non-existent down payment used to obtain financing for the purchase.\n\nAs of September 11, 2000, Scanlon was one of the lobbyists assigned to Abramoff's team lobbying on behalf of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan. After Abramoff left Preston Gates and went to Greenberg Traurig in January 2001, Scanlon formed his own public relations firm, Capitol Campaign Strategies (along with the dummy organizations American International Center, Atlantic Research Analysis, and Scanlon Gould Public Affairs). Abramoff and Scanlon used the firm to bilk tribal clients for millions of dollars in fees. Abramoff directed clients to use Scanlon's firm for political campaign services, without disclosing his own relationship with Scanlon. Scanlon's firm would then only perform part of the campaign services billed for, and would split the excess money received with Abramoff in a scheme known to the two as \"Gimme Five\".\n\nPrivate communications revealed as a result of the Congressional enquiry into Scanlon and Abramoff's consulting business demonstrate a contemptuous attitude to both clients and supporters. Indian Clients were referred to as \"troglodytes\" and \"monkeys\", while Christian Conservatives were called gullible \"wackos\" who could be manipulated to vote on demand:\n\nScanlon also emailed colleagues, saying: \n\nOn November 18, 2005, in a one-count criminal information filed by the US Justice Department, Scanlon was charged with conspiring with another lobbyist, who was identified only as \"Lobbyist A\", believed to be Abramoff. That same day Scanlon agreed to testify against Abramoff in any future criminal case involving his ex-partner. On November 21, 2005, in proceedings before Federal District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a member of Congress and other public officials. Under the plea agreement, Scanlon will repay $19.6 million to his former Indian tribe lobbying clients.\n\nScanlon was portrayed by Barry Pepper in the 2010 film \"Casino Jack\".\n\n\n"}

Wallis Myers of \"The Daily Telegraph\" and the \"Daily Mail\", Godfree was ranked in the world top ten from 1921 (when the rankings began) through 1927, reaching a career high of World No. 2 in those rankings in 1923, 1924, and 1926.\n\nGodfree won five Olympic medals in tennis at the 1920 Antwerp and 1924 Paris games, the most Olympic medals ever won by a tennis player until Venus Williams matched this record at the 2016 Olympic Games. In 1923 she captured the title at the World Covered Court Championships.\n\nGodfree won the Wimbledon singles title twice. In the 1924 final, Godfree recovered from a set and 4–1 (40–15) down against Helen Wills to win the title. This was the only defeat at Wimbledon for Wills who would go on to win eight titles. In the 1926 final, Godfree recovered from a 3–1 and game-point-against deficit in the third set to defeat Lili de Alvarez.\n\nThe 1924 Wimbledon final was not Godfree's only victory over Wills. Godfree also defeated Wills during the 1924 Wightman Cup 6–2, 6–2. On at least two other occasions, Godfree pushed Wills to the limit. Wills won their quarterfinal in the 1923 U.S. Championships 2–6, 6–2, 7–5 after Godfree recovered to 5–5 in the third set after trailing 5–2.

She presented the winner's trophy to Martina Navratilova in 1986, in honour of the centenary year of play at Wimbledon. Godfree was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1978.\n\nIn badminton, Godfree won eight All England Open Badminton Championships from 1920 through 1925, considered the unofficial World Badminton Championships until 1977.\n\nShe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1988 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Godfree died on 19 June 1992 at the age of 96.\n\nThrough 1923, the French Championships were open only to French nationals. The World Hard Court Championships (WHCC), actually played on clay in Paris or Brussels, began in 1912 and were open to all nationalities.

{"id": "2145547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145547", "title": "Deal with the Devil", "text": "Deal with the Devil\n\nA deal with the devil (also known as a compact or pact with the devil) is a cultural motif in European folklore, best exemplified by the legend of Faust and the figure of Mephistopheles, as well as being elemental to many Christian traditions. According to traditional Christian belief about witchcraft, the pact is between a person and Satan or a lesser demon. The person offers their soul in exchange for diabolical favours. Those favours vary by the tale, but tend to include youth, knowledge, wealth, fame, or power.\n\nIt was also believed that some people made this type of pact just as a sign of recognizing the minion as their master, in exchange for nothing. Nevertheless, the bargain is considered a dangerous one, as the price of the Fiend's service is the wagerer's soul. The tale may have a moralizing end, with eternal damnation for the foolhardy venturer. Conversely, it may have a comic twist, in which a wily peasant outwits the devil, characteristically on a technical point. The person making the pact sometimes tries to outwit the devil, but loses in the end (e.g., man sells his soul for eternal life because he will never die to pay his end of the bargain. Immune to the death penalty, he commits murder, but is sentenced to life in prison).\n\nGreat achievements might be credited to a pact with the devil, from the numerous European Devil's Bridges to the violin virtuosity of Giuseppe Tartini and Niccolò Paganini to the \"crossroad\" myth associated with Robert Johnson.\n\nThe \"Bargain with the devil\" constitutes motif number M210 and \"Man sells soul to devil\" motif number M211 in Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk-Literature.\n\nIt was usually thought that the person who had made a pact also promised the demon to kill children or consecrate them to the devil at the moment of birth (many midwives were accused of this, due to the number of children who died at birth in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance), take part in Witches' Sabbaths, have sexual relations with demons, and sometimes engender children from a succubus, or an incubus in the case of women.\n\nThe pact can be either oral or written. An oral pact may be made by means of invocations, conjurations, or rituals to attract the demon; once the conjurer thinks the demon is present, he/she asks for the wanted favour and offers his/her soul in exchange, and no evidence is left of the pact. But according to some witch trials, even the oral pact left evidence, the Witches' mark, an indelible mark where the marked person had been touched by the devil to seal the pact. The mark could be used as a proof to determine that the pact was made. It was also believed that on the spot where the mark was left, the marked person could feel no pain. A written pact consists in the same forms of attracting the demon, but includes a written act, usually signed with the conjurer's blood (although sometimes it was also alleged that the whole act had to be written with blood; meanwhile some demonologists defended the idea of using red ink instead of blood and others suggested the use of animal blood instead of human blood).\n\nThese acts were presented often as a proof of diabolical pacts, though critics claim there is no proof of whether they were authentic, written by insane persons believing they were actually dealing with a demon, or just were fake acts presented by the tribunals. Usually the acts included strange characters that were said to be the signature of a demon, and each one had his own signature or seal. Books like \"The Lesser Key of Solomon\" (also known as \"Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis\") give a detailed list of these signs, known as diabolical signatures.\n\nThe \"Malleus Maleficarum\" discusses several alleged instances of pacts with the Devil, especially concerning women. It was considered that all witches and warlocks had made a pact with one of the demons, usually Satan.\n\nAccording to demonology, there is a specific month, day of the week, and hour to call each demon, so the invocation for a pact has to be done at the right time. Also, as each demon has a specific function, a certain demon is invoked depending on what the conjurer is going to ask.\n\nIn the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus is offered a series of bargains by the devil, in which he is promised worldly riches and glory in exchange for serving the devil rather than God. After Jesus rejects the devil's offers, he embarks on his travels as the Messiah. (see Temptations of Christ).\n\nThe predecessor of Faustus in Christian mythology is Theophilus (\"Friend of God\" or \"Beloved of God\") the unhappy and despairing cleric, disappointed in his worldly career by his bishop, who sells his soul to the devil but is redeemed by the Virgin Mary. His story appears in a Greek version of the 6th century written by a \"Eutychianus\" who claims to have been a member of the household in question.\n\nA 9th-century \"Miraculum Sancte Marie de Theophilo penitente\" inserts a Virgin as intermediary with \"diabolus\", his \"patron\", providing the prototype of a closely linked series in the Latin literature of the West.\n\nIn the 10th century, the poet nun Hroswitha of Gandersheim adapted the text of Paulus Diaconus for a narrative poem that elaborates Theophilus' essential goodness and internalizes the seduction of good and evil, in which the devil is \"magus\", a necromancer. As in her model, Theophilus receives back his contract from the devil, displays it to the congregation, and soon dies.\n\nA long poem on the subject by Gautier de Coincy (1177/8–1236), entitled \"Le miracle de Théophile: ou comment Théophile vint à la pénitence\" provided material for a 13th-century play by Rutebeuf, \"Le Miracle de Théophile\", where Theophilus is the central pivot in a frieze of five characters, the Virgin and the bishop flanking him on the side of good, the Jew and the devil on the side of evil.\n\n\nThe term \"a pact with the devil\" is also used metaphorically to condemn a person or persons perceived as having collaborated with an evil person or regime. An example of this is the Nazi-Jewish negotiations during the Holocaust, both positively and negatively. Under Jewish law, the principle of pikuach nefesh (\"saving life\") is an obligation to compromise one's principles in order to preserve human life. However, Rudolf Kastner was accused of negotiating with the Nazis to save a select few at the expense of the many. According to some, the term served to inflame public hatred against Kastner, culminating in his assassination.\n\n"}

The film was written by Stevan Bulajić and Veljko Bulajić, and directed by Veljko Bulajić. It is based on the true events of World War II. The Battle of the Neretva was due to a strategic plan for a combined Axis powers attack in 1943 against the Yugoslav Partisans. The plan was also known as the Fourth Enemy Offensive and occurred in the area of the Neretva river in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\"Battle of Neretva\" is the most expensive motion picture made in the SFR Yugoslavia. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the year after Sergei Bondarchuk (playing the role of Martin in \"Neretva\") won the honour for \"War and Peace\". The score for the English-speaking versions was composed by Bernard Herrmann. Its soundtrack was released by Entr'acte Recording Society in 1974. It was re-released on Southern Cross Records on CD.\n\nOne of the original posters for the English version of the movie was made by Pablo Picasso, which, according to Bulajić, the famous painter agreed to do without payment, only requesting a case of the best Yugoslav wines.\n\n\n\"Battle of Neretva\" was the first of a series of huge state-sponsored World War II film productions. It had a staggering budget approved by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. Different sources put it anywhere between $4.5 million and $12 million. Global stars such as Sergei Bondarchuk, Yul Brynner, Franco Nero, Orson Welles, etc. flocked to communist Yugoslavia attracted by the huge sums of money being offered.\n\nShot over 16 months with funds put up in largest part by over 58 self-managed companies in Yugoslavia, the movie featured a combined battalion of 10,000 Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) soldiers. Four villages and a fortress were constructed for the film and destroyed. Several JNA-inventory Soviet T-34 tanks, touched up to look like German Panzers, met the same fate.\n\nA railway bridge over the Neretva in Jablanica was destroyed. Director Bulajić's justification for demolishing the bridge rather than getting the shots in studio was that it would become a tourist attraction. The bridge was thus blown but because none of the footage was usable due to the billowing smoke that made it impossible to see anything, it was decided that the bridge should be repaired and destroyed again. The problem with the excessive smoke occurred again and the scenes of the bridge being blown up in the film were shot using a table-size replica at a sound stage in Prague. The Yugoslav public was updated on the shooting progress via pieces in the country's print media.\n\nIn 1999, a poll of Croatian film fans found it to be one of the best Yugoslavian films ever made. People throughout the former Yugoslavia still enjoy it and it is praised for its big-budget scale, and emotional strength.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2145561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145561", "title": "Junior ice hockey", "text": "Junior ice hockey\n\nJunior hockey is a level of competitive ice hockey generally for players between 16 and 21 years of age. Junior hockey leagues in the United States and Canada are considered amateur (with some exceptions) and operate within regions of each country.\n\nIn Canada, the highest level is major junior, and is governed by the Canadian Hockey League, which itself has three constituent leagues: the Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, and the Western Hockey League. The second tier is Junior A, governed nationally by the Canadian Junior Hockey League and is composed of several regional leagues.\n\nIn the United States, the top level is Tier I, represented by the United States Hockey League. Tier II is represented by the North American Hockey League. There are several Tier III and independently sanctioned leagues throughout the country. A limited number of teams in the Canadian major junior leagues are also based in the United States.\n\nIn Europe, junior teams are often sponsored by professional teams, and act as development and feeder associations for those organizations.\n\nIn Canada, junior hockey is one level above minor ice hockey, the level of ice hockey played by youth. It is often called \"youth hockey\" in the United States, so as to not to be confused with minor league professional hockey.\n\nJunior hockey in Canada is broken into several tiers, and players aged 16–20 at the beginning of the season are eligible. Hockey Canada is enacting rules designed to limit the number of 16-year-olds allowed to play junior hockey, preferring most remain at the midget level.\n\nMajor junior hockey is overseen by the Canadian Hockey League (CHL), which acts as the governing body for its three constituent leagues:\n\nThe CHL currently places a cap of three 20-year-old-or-over players per team, commonly known as \"overage players\". The CHL also allows up to four 16-year-olds on each roster. While fifteen-year-old players were formerly permitted to play a limited number of games per season at the CHL level, they are now permitted to play only if they are deemed exceptional by the CHL. , seven players have qualified under this rule: centre John Tavares in 2005, defenceman Aaron Ekblad in 2011, centre Connor McDavid in 2012, defenceman Sean Day in 2013, centre Joe Veleno in 2015, centre Shane Wright in 2019, and forward Connor Bedard in 2020. CHL teams are currently permitted two \"imports\" (players from outside Canada or the US, generally from Europe or Russia) each, though this cap is expected to be reduced to one within a couple of seasons.\n\nDue to paying players stipends and allowing junior players that have signed entry-level contracts with the NHL, all CHL teams are considered professional by the NCAA; thus any player who plays a game at the Major Junior level loses his eligibility to play for universities in the United States. The player retains eligibility for Canadian universities however, and all three leagues have programs in place to grant scholarships for any player who plays in these leagues provided he does not turn professional once their junior career ends. Many of the National Hockey League’s (NHL) top prospects play in the CHL.\n\nThe champion of each league competes in an annual tournament with a predetermined host team for the Memorial Cup, Canada's national major junior championship.\n\nUp until 1970, the leagues that were classified as Major Junior and \"Junior A\" today were both part of Junior A. In 1970 they were divided into \"Tier I Junior A\" or \"Major Junior A\" and \"Tier II Junior A\". In 1980, the three Major Junior A leagues opted for self-control over being controlled by the branches of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and became Major Junior hockey, Tier II Junior A became the top tier of hockey in the CAHA and became Junior A hockey.\n\nJunior A (junior AAA in Quebec) hockey is one level below the CHL. Junior A was referred to as Tier II Junior A in the 1970s, until what was called Major Junior A broke away from their regional branches in 1980 and formed the Canadian Hockey League, becoming Major Junior hockey. At that time, the term Tier II was dropped from what is now Junior A hockey. It is governed by the Canadian Junior Hockey League, which oversees eleven constituent leagues across Canada. The national championship is the Centennial Cup.\n\nJunior A teams are considered amateur by the NCAA, thus players intending to go to American universities tend to choose this route rather than play in the CHL. Junior A teams tend to play in much smaller markets than CHL teams, and thus play to smaller crowds.\n\nJunior B (junior AA in Quebec) was created in 1933, to differentiate between teams eligible for Memorial Cup competition and those who were not. The major championships across Canada are the Sutherland Cup in Southern Ontario, the Barkley Cup in the Ottawa District, the Coupe Dodge in Quebec, the Don Johnson Cup in the Atlantic Provinces, and the Keystone Cup which represents all of Western Canada, from British Columbia to Northwestern Ontario.\n\nJunior C (junior A in Quebec) generally consists of local competitions, but is considered competitive in some regions, and serve as seeding or farm-teams for Junior B teams. Ontario Junior C Hockey has 6 rounds of best-of-seven playoffs (up to 42 games per team) for the Clarence Schmalz Cup which was first awarded in 1938. The Ontario Junior C playoffs are played for between 6 of the Province's 7 different regional leagues. In Quebec and West of Manitoba, Junior C hockey tends to be an extension of the local minor hockey system and is sometimes called Juvenile or House League. In Ontario, Manitoba, and the Maritimes, Junior C is run independently of minor hockey systems, though with the same mostly recreational purpose.\n\nJunior D was popular in the 1960s and 1970s in dense population centers, but fell off in the early 1990s. In Quebec, Junior D is now known as Junior B and is run strictly by minor hockey associations. The last Junior D league was the OHA's Southern Ontario Junior Hockey League, the result of the merger of the Northern, Western, and Southern Junior D leagues in the late 1980s. The SOJHL moved to Junior C league in 2012.\n\nAs in Canada, junior hockey in the United States is subdivided into several levels with most being sanctioned by USA Hockey. Currently, 13 American teams play in the Canadian junior system, with eight in the Canadian Hockey League and five in junior A leagues. The CHL includes four teams in Washington and one in Oregon in the Western Hockey League, and two teams in Michigan and one in Pennsylvania in the Ontario Hockey League. At junior A level, two teams in the Superior International Junior Hockey League are in Minnesota and Wisconsin, one team in the British Columbia Hockey League is from Washington, one in the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League is from Michigan, and one in the Ontario Junior Hockey League is from New York.\n\nThe United States Hockey League (USHL) is currently the only Tier I league in the country, consisting of teams in the central and midwestern United States. The USHL provides an alternative to major junior hockey for kids who want to play in the NCAA before entering a professional league such as the NHL.\n\nWhile playing in the USHL, all player expenses are paid for by the team; no membership or equipment fees are charged. Unlike major junior teams, the professional leagues draft significantly less directly from the USHL teams and the free-college stipend does not exist.\n\nFor most of its existence the USHL was considered inferior in quality of play to the major junior levels. But it continued to improve and as of 2019 about 21% of NHL players had played USHL in their career. Between 80 and 90 percent of USHL players continued into NCAA hockey, with 33% advancing to the NHL as of 2019.\n\nCurrently, the North American Hockey League is the only USA Hockey-sanctioned Tier II league in the United States. The NAHL consists of teams spread across the western two thirds of the United States with a significant concentration of teams in the central and southwestern parts of the United States, although the league began to expand to east coast as of 2015. In October 2016, the Tier III United States Premier Hockey League, a league predominately located on the east coast, applied to USA Hockey for approval of a Tier II league to begin in the 2017–18 season, however, the league was denied that December and decided to operate its Tier II league independently.\n\nThe NAHL, like the USHL, provides young players an alternative to major junior hockey, although the skill level is considered significantly lower than major junior hockey and typically filled with those who would not or did not make the roster of a Tier I team. Unlike Tier I, the NAHL does not pay for all players' expenses, such as room and board, but there is no tuition cost to the player as in Tier III.\n\nIn addition to paying for room and board, players at the Tier III level pay a fee or tuition, commonly ranging from $4,000 to $9,500. This is for all accounts and purposes an amateur level, although some players go directly to NCAA Division I schools. Most Tier III players are looking to increase their skills in hopes to move up to Tier I or II, while other players go directly to NCAA Division III, ACHA and CHF schools.\n\nPrior to July 2011, USA Hockey split Tier III into Junior A and B divisions.\n\nUSA Hockey currently has three sanctioned Tier III leagues:\n\nSome leagues that refer to themselves as Junior A also operate outside the control of the Hockey Canada and USA Hockey, typically due to restrictions from the governing bodies over player recruitment and financials. While a league can claim to be comparable to Junior A leagues, due to the lack of regulation the actual level of play may vary. In addition to independent leagues, there are also independent teams, such as the Jamestown Jets, although these usually result from league problems or other disputes. These leagues are often referred to as \"outlaw\" leagues due to their lack of sanctioning or oversight from an outside governing body.\n\nThe Amateur Athletic Union returned to sanctioning the sport of ice hockey in 2011. Prior to the 2011–12 season, the Western States Hockey League became the first large-scale junior league to exit USA Hockey in favor of the AAU. In 2012, the AAU formed the United Hockey Union for managing its hockey leagues and held a championship tournament in 2013 and 2014. Currently all junior hockey leagues under the UHU umbrella operate under a similar pay-to-play USA Hockey Tier III and Hockey Canada's Junior A structure, although the WSHL is considered Tier II within the UHU hierarchy. The UHU announced that starting in 2017 it would launch a free-to-play Tier I league called the Central One Hockey League; however, plans for the league were later called off and the people behind the C1HL launched the non-sanctioned USA Central Hockey League in 2018.\n\nOne of the main reasons that some teams and leagues have chosen the AAU is for the looser player import restrictions. In most USA Hockey sanctioned leagues, each team is limited to a maximum of four non-US citizen players (with a loophole for non-US citizens that have been registered USA Hockey members for three seasons). However, under AAU sanctioning, teams may have up to 14 non-North American players (meaning players from Canada and the United States are not counted as imports in either country). The increased import limit has led to more competitive teams where it was more difficult to recruit local talent. It also allows more European players opportunities to play in the junior level of North American hockey leagues that would be normally be limited under Hockey Canada and USA Hockey restrictions.\n\n\nOther leagues have their own guidelines for team and player restrictions with no outside oversight by a governing body.\n\nSince 2006, the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League has operated as an independent league in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta. The league widely recruits players from outside of North America.\n\nIn late 2016, the United States Premier Hockey League, an organization composed of several USA Hockey Tier III junior as well as many youth hockey leagues, applied for a Tier II league. The Tier II status was denied in December 2016 but the USPHL moved forward with the new league anyway, creating the National Collegiate Development Conference. In response, the USPHL has removed all their junior level leagues (the NCDC and the Tier III-level Premier and Elite Divisions) from USA Hockey sanctioning since the 2017–18 season.\n\nIn Europe, junior teams are usually associated with a professional team, and are used by professional teams to develop their own prospects. One example of this is the J20 SuperElit league in Sweden or the Minor Hockey League in Russia. Such leagues are sometimes dubbed major junior hockey leagues.\n\nThe lack of an amateur draft in Europe means that the onus is on the teams to sign the most talented young players they can get, and the presence of an affiliated junior team provides a place for young players who are not yet ready for the rigours of the professional game to develop. However, not all players on a European junior team are necessarily the property of their professional club, and may elect to sign elsewhere.\n\nAt the World Hockey Summit in 2010, nations in Europe expressed concern about the number of junior players leaving to play in North America, despite the improved talent level and the increasing popularity of the IIHF Ice Hockey World Junior Championships. Slavomir Lener, a director with the Czech Ice Hockey Association, felt that junior-aged players were enticed to play in North America before maturation, with had a negative effect on the development of the player and the European system. He stated that of the 527 Czech Republic players who went to North American junior hockey, only 22 of them played more than 400 NHL games. He sought to establish a European system that was competitive enough to deter players from entering into the CHL Import Draft.\n\n\n"}

Lying in repose differs from the more formal honor of lying in state, which is generally held at the principal government building of the deceased person's country and often accompanied by a guard of honour.\n\nIn the United States, the distinction between lying in repose and lying in state is not often observed. Lying in state is generally considered to be when one's body is placed in the rotunda of the United States Capitol. When the deceased person is placed in another location, like the Great Hall of the Supreme Court, they lie in repose, as was the case following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016.\n\nThe remains of presidents who die in office generally lie in repose in the East Room of the White House while those of a deceased former president generally lie in repose in his home state. However, as an example to the contrary, when the body of John F. Kennedy lay in repose, the term meant \"private\" as opposed to a public lying in state.\n\nThe body of Babe Ruth lay in repose in Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe body of singer Israel Kamakawiwo'ole lay in repose in the state capital building of Hawaii in 1997. \n\nNot everyone eligible to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda does so. For instance, the body of former President Richard Nixon lay in repose at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California, Senator Edward Kennedy's body lay in repose at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts, and Senator Robert Byrd's body lay in repose in the Senate chamber at the Capitol.\n\nIn Canada, when deceased governors general and prime ministers lie anywhere outside of the Centre Block of Parliament Hill, they lie in repose. In the Hall of Honour, the Senate, or the foyer of the House of Commons, they lie in state.\n\nAt the provincial, territorial or local levels, current and former politicians may lie in state or repose in government buildings.\n\n\n"}

They formed in 1978 in Whitley Bay, England, and were active until 1987. The band reformed in 1999 and continue to record and perform. The name is derived from Pan Tang, a fictional archipelago in Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melniboné fantasy series whose wizards keep tigers as pets.\n\nThe Tygers of Pan Tang were formed by Robb Weir (guitar), Richard \"Rocky\" Laws (bass), Jess Cox (vocals) and Brian Dick (drums). They played in working men's clubs and were first signed by local independent label Neat Records before MCA gave them a major record deal. After several singles, they released their first album, \"Wild Cat\", in 1980. The album reached No. 18 in the UK Album Chart in the first week of its release.\n\nSubsequently John Sykes (formerly of Streetfighter, later in Badlands, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, and Blue Murder) was added as second guitarist. Jess Cox had a falling out with the others and quit, to be replaced by Persian Risk vocalist Jon Deverill. This lineup released \"Spellbound\" in 1981.\n\nSykes quit after the release of the third album, \"Crazy Nights\", to audition for Ozzy Osbourne's band. He was replaced by ex-Penetration guitarist Fred Purser, who had to learn the set in two days before touring.\n\nTygers of Pan Tang's fourth album, \"The Cage\", was released in 1982. The band then had a disagreement with MCA, who were not prepared to promote them unless they agreed to play more cover recordings (following the band's hit with \"Love Potion No. 9\"). They subsequently tried to break free from their contract, but MCA's demands exceeded the willingness of any other record company to pay to free the band, and the band broke up in frustration.\n\nJohn Sykes later achieved success with Thin Lizzy and then Whitesnake.\n\nSongs for a new album were demoed by the same line-up which completed the previous album. It was supposed to be called \"Square One\". The label did not approve the material and, in consequence this line-up dismembered. Songs from this aborted album ended up appearing later, in 2018, under the name \"Purser Deverill\".\n\nIn 1985, Jon Deverill and Brian Dick reformed the band with Steve Lamb (formerly of Sergeant) on guitar, Neil Sheppard on guitar, and ex-Warrior, ex-Satan member Clin Irwin on bass. Dave Donaldson later replaced Clin Irwin. Meanwhile, Robb Weir and Jess Cox formed the spin-off band Tyger-Tyger.\n\nThe reformed Tygers of Pan Tang released \"The Wreck-Age\" in summer 1985 through Music for Nations, and \"Burning in the Shade\" in 1987, through Zebra Records. \"Burning in the Shade\" received poor reviews and they disbanded again.\n\nVarious compilations and live albums were produced by the band's two first labels, Neat Records and MCA.\n\nDuring the 1998 Wacken Open Air festival, Jess Cox joined on stage with Blitzkrieg, playing three old Tygers songs. The audience's response was positive, and a year later, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Tygers of Pan Tang and the 10th Wacken Open Air, the band was invited to play on the main stage. Brian Dick and Rocky were unable to join the band, but the Tygers (now Jess Cox and Robb Weir, backed up by Blitzkrieg guitarist Glenn S Howes, bassist Gavin Gray, and drummer Chris Percy) did perform. Recordings of their performance resulted in the \"Live at Wacken\" album.\n\nIn 2000, Robb Weir reformed the band as the only original member. The other musicians were Tony Liddell (vocals), Dean Robertson (lead guitar), Brian West (bass), and Craig Ellis (drums). They released \"Mystical\" through Z-Records.

In his early years, he performed in various ensembles representing a wide range of musical genres, including The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Steve Reich and Musicians, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, The Klezmatics, John Zorn, and Billband. In 1991 he won the second prize at the International Gaudeamus Competition in Rotterdam, Netherlands.\n\nHe has created well over 40 compositions for bass clarinet, both solo and with electronics. His works explore the possibilities of large ensembles of bass clarinets (done by multi-tracking), live looping using Cycling 74's Max software (of which he was an early beta tester in 1990) and, more recently, Ableton Live. His style has evolved from his early years of \"academic\" electronic classical music into popular idioms, including funk, jazz and pop.\n\nBetween October 2006 and January 2012, a segment of his playing with Billband has been used as the theme for the National Public Radio segment \"Science Out of the Box,\" which airs on the \"Weekend All Things Considered\" program. He has been a featured guest on the In C episode of RadioLab, two episodes of The Clarineat podcast, and numerous other radio and podcast interviews. He is affiliated with Vandoren and Selmer, the latter of whom developed a custom all-black bass clarinet in partnership with Lowenstern in 2015.\n\nLowenstern holds degrees from the Eastman School of Music, an Artist's Certificate from the Sweelinck Conservatorium Amsterdam, and an M.M. and D.M.A. from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. In 1989, he received a Fulbright grant to study in Amsterdam with bass clarinet virtuoso Harry Sparnaay. In addition to Sparnaay, Lowenstern's teachers have included Charles Neidich, Richard MacDowell, and John Bruce Yeh. \n\nLowenstern has, in the past, served on the faculties of New York University and the Juilliard School, and is now on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music, teaching bass clarinet in their Contemporary Performance Program. He served as bass clarinetist of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra from 1999 until his retirement from orchestral playing in 2005. He appears on over sixty CDs, including seven solo recordings.\n\nMichael's website, earspasm, has been an online resource for bass clarinetists since 1997. While initially a promotional website for Lowenstern's music and performing career, it now features an online shop and a popular Dear Abby mailbag, where Lowenstern answers clarinet and bass clarinet players' questions.\n\nSince 2011, Lowenstern has been producing educational videos on YouTube, and has over 150 in his catalog on the platform. A few of his videos have created some controversy in the clarinet world, and he is often the subject of intense debate on the long-established Clarinet Pages of Woodwind.org\n\n"}

It is in the Dublin 7 postal district.\n\nJames Collins' 1913 book \"Life in Old Dublin\" notes that \"Centuries ago (Stoneybatter) was called Bothar-na-gCloch\". In Joyce's Irish names of places we find the following interesting information as to the original name of the place: \"Long before the city had extended so far, and while Stoneybatter was nothing more than a country road, it was -- as it still continues to be -- the great thoroughfare to Dublin from the districts lying west and north-west of the city; and it was known by the name of \"Bothar-na-gCloch\" (\"Bohernaglogh\"), i.e. the road of the stones, which was changed to the English equivalent, Stoneybatter or stony road\".\n\nStoneybatter is the main location for events in the Tana French novel \"The Trespasser\" and the area is mentioned in the Irish folk song \"The Spanish Lady\".\n\nApart from the striking artisan dwellings, the area is also known for the prominent Viking street names. For example, there is Viking Road, Olaf Road, Thor Place, Sitric Road, Norseman Place, Ard Ri Road, Malachi Road, Ostman Place, Ivar Street, Sigurd Road and Harold Road. At the time of the Norman invasion, the Vikings, Ostmen or Austmenn (men of the East) as they called themselves, were exiled to the north of the Liffey where they founded the hamlet of Ostmenstown later to become Oxmantown.\n\nThe northern end of Stoneybatter derives its name of Manor Street, bestowed in 1780, from the Manor of Grangegorman in which it was located. During the reign of Charles II (1660-1680), the Manor was held by Sir Thomas Stanley, a knight of Henry Cromwell and a staunch supporter of the Restoration. The short thoroughfare in Stoneybatter called Stanley Street is named after him.\n\nThe streets and surrounding areas of Stoneybatter have been used as a filming location for both TV and film:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The story is the penultimate arc of Grant Morrison's run as writer on the \"X-Men\", and features the return of Magneto and the death of Jean Grey again.\n\nComing off the heels of the \"Assault on Weapon Plus\" storyline, Jean Grey, Beast, and Emma Frost leave the X-Mansion while Xorn forces the newest member of the \"Special Class\", Dust, to attack Professor X and destroy Cerebra. Confronting Xavier, Xorn imprisons Dust in a jar to keep her from helping the professor, and then removes his mask, to reveal that he is Magneto in disguise.\n\nMagneto, enjoying the lack of progress Xavier has made in improving mutantkind's lot since his \"death\" (partly due to his manipulations), has begun to teach his militant anti-human philosophy to the Special Class while indulging in the mutant-power enhancing drug Kick, supplied to him by his helper, Esme of the Stepford Cuckoos. He also reveals that he (Magneto) has been responsible for restoring Xavier's mobility via reprogramming the nanite Sentinels inserted into Xavier's body by Cassandra Nova and shuts them down and places the once more crippled Xavier in a glass tank, in a state of suspended animation. Magneto, surrounded by his followers and original Brotherhood member Toad, takes over New York City. Magneto lays waste to the city and engages in multiple acts of mass murder, killing thousands of humans trapped in the city. Magneto also reveals his grand scheme: reversing Earth's magnetic field and remake the planet as \"Planet X\" in which mutants, the possessors of the \"X-gene\", ruled over ordinary humans.\n\nMeanwhile, in space, Jean Grey and Wolverine are stranded on Asteroid M as Magneto has sent it hurling into the sun just as the two recognize the base. Wanting to end her suffering, Wolverine stabs Jean. Her seeming death allows her to be connect with the Phoenix Force, though in full control over her powers this time, and escape with Logan back to Earth. They rescue Beast and Emma Frost, whose jetcraft was destroyed by Magneto, stranding the two at sea on the wreckage of the ship. Meanwhile, Cyclops and Fantomex organize a resistance group with help from the remaining Stepford Cuckoos, and are joined by Beak, who rejects Magneto when the latter, in part due to his drug addiction and loss of sanity, starts killing humans by the hundreds.\n\nIn the final showdown, Xavier is freed and the New X-Men unite to fight Magneto. As Magneto murders Esme, Cyclops tells the grieving Emma that he's decided upon which woman (Jean or Emma) he loves but is interrupted by Magneto's attack and responds in kind, destroying his helmet as Fantomex frees Xavier. Desperate for protection against Xavier's telepathy, Magneto grabs his \"Xorn\" mask and puts it on. Having realized that Xorn is Magneto or at least believes himself to be Magneto, the X-Men attempt to unbalance him by calling him Xorn as they attack, complete with them begging \"Xorn\" to tell them why \"he\" betrayed the X-Men.\n\nMagneto, whose sanity is slipping due to excessive \"Kick\" usage, begins to rant furiously that he is not Xorn, but Magneto as a crowd of Magneto's supporters gather alongside Xavier and Jean Grey. Jean orders Magneto to address his angry army, who are furious at Magneto for the way that he has failed to address the lack of food and water for his makeshift army of Manhattan mutants since taking over the island. Magneto (who removes the \"Xorn\" mask) tries to calm them down, but the crowd doesn't recognize him due to his optic blast damaged face. At that point Xavier explains that Magneto, with his murderous rampage, has lost all credibility with the masses. Xavier admits that in death, Magneto had finally gained legitimacy amongst humans and mutants alike as a true figure for change in society but that his return and the mass murders he committed had caused the world to label Magneto as a fraud. Xavier opines that the days of him and Magneto as the sole ideologies of mutantkind was over and that it was time for mutantkind to come up with their own opinions and theories of their place in the world.\n\nMagneto falls over and Jean Grey approaches him, only to be hit by a lethal electro-magnetic pulse. As Jean falls to the ground dying, Magneto (putting the Xorn helmet back on) defiantly cries out for someone to kill him; Magneto would rather be dead than judged by the mutant masses as a fraud. Wolverine, now berserk at the sight of Jean dying, uses his claws to decapitate Magneto.\n\nDying, Jean is held tightly by Cyclops as the two reconcile. With her dying breath, Jean begs Cyclops to move on with his life and not waste his remaining days mourning her, as she tells Scott, \"All I ever do is die on you...\"\n\nThe final pages of the issue cut to 150 years into the future, where a \"Phoenix Egg\" is found on the moon by an astronaut, offering a segue into the final arc of Morrison's X-Men run, the future based \"Here Comes Tomorrow\".\n\nGrant Morrison had intended Xorn to be the real Magneto. However, Marvel reversed several of Morrison's decisions after the \"Planet X\" arc, and reintroduced Magneto (in Chris Claremont's new \"Excalibur\" book), establishing that Magneto had survived the destruction of Genosha, and had remained there since. Marvel also introduced a new Xorn (in Chuck Austen's \"X-Men\"), establishing that the new Xorn was the brother of the original and that the original had been possessed by some (unknown) force, widely believed to be Sublime, a conscious, highly evolved and intelligent bacteria colony. Austen explained Marvel's reasoning for the retconning, stating that \"Marvel saw value in Magneto not being a mass-murderer of New Yorkers.\"\n\nMorrison has expressed surprise at the various retcons and explanations for the events of the story that emerged after his departure from Marvel. During an interview, Morrison said \"Here's how to explain what happened – XORN was NEVER REAL, he was a DISGUISE for MAGNETO who went MAD ON DRUGS and DIED...but we know he always COMES BACK, somehow, so expect a dramatic return sooner or later, True Believers!\"\n\nWhen asked to comment on his characterization of Magneto, Grant Morrison responded: \"What people often forget, of course, is that Magneto, unlike the lovely Sir Ian McKellen, is a mad old terrorist twat. No matter how he justifies his stupid, brutal behaviour, or how anyone else tries to justify it, in the end he's just an old bastard with daft, old ideas based on violence and coercion. I really wanted to make that clear at this time.\" Morrison also stated that the arc was intended as a statement on the rigidly elastic nature of the status quo in franchise comics, and that the arc had taken such dark leanings because \"my loved ones were dying all around me\" at the time of writing.\n\nThe series has been collected into a trade paperback:\n\n\nAs well as:\n\n\n ."}
{"id": "2145595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145595", "title": "Texas State Highway 99", "text": "Texas State Highway 99\n\nState Highway 99, also known as the Grand Parkway, is a highway in Texas, United States, that opened its first section in 1994. When State Highway 99 is complete, it will be the longest beltway in the U.S., the third longest ring road in the world, and the third (outer) loop within Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area, with Interstate 610 being the first (inner) loop, and Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Tollway) being the second (middle) loop. The proposed loop has been divided into 11 separate segments for construction and funding purposes. In May 2019, the Texas Department of Transportation gave the Grand Parkway a secondary, yet honorable designation as the Mayor Bob Lanier Memorial Parkway. Bob Lanier, who served as the mayor of Houston from 1992 to 1998, had spearheaded the creation of the Grand Parkway. \n\nSH 99 was designated on August 18, 1924, from San Angelo to Fort Stockton. On June 25, 1929, SH 99 had extended to Alpine. On March 2, 1932, and a spur to Sherwood, SH 99A, was added but was maintained by the county. On July 23, 1934, this route was transferred to SH 10, and SH 99A was cancelled by then. On October 29, 1960, a new route was made for SH 99, going from Denton to the Oklahoma line as a renumbering of SH 10, to match OK 99 at its border. On April 29, 1968, this route became part of US 377. On October 25, 1984, SH 99 was designated along a very similar route to today's, but ending at SH 146 (Loop 201 until March 28, 1996) and Spur 330. On March 28, 2002, SH 99 was rerouted further east along a new route south to Spur 55 and along Spur 55 to Business SH 146. Spur 55 was cancelled, but it was not effective until completion of that section of SH 99 in 2008.\n\nSegment A is a segment that would extend from SH 146 to I-45 South. It is currently not considered a viable project.\n\nSegment B Construction has not yet begun. This segment extends from I-45 South to SH 288.\n\nSegment C Construction has not yet begun. This segment extends from SH 288 to I-69/US 59 South.\n\nSegment D, the first section opened, runs\nfrom just north of Interstate 10/US 90, west of Houston, south to Interstate 69/US 59 in Sugar Land where it terminates and intersects with FM 2759. The portion of this segment south of the interchange with the Westpark Tollway is now a four-lane divided highway feeder road, with maintains crossing over the Westpark Tollway.\n\nThe 18-month-long construction of two ramps connecting westbound I-10/US 90 to southbound SH-99 and northbound SH-99 to eastbound I-10/US 90 was completed in 2011. The occasional traffic jams at this intersection prompted the sped-up construction of the ramps before the through lanes of SH-99 were built through the I-10/US 90 interchange. Two more ramps connecting southbound SH-99 to eastbound I-10/US 90 and westbound I-10/US 90 to northbound SH-99 opened as part of the construction of Segment E in December 2013. A final ramp connecting northbound SH-99 to westbound I-10/US 90 has been completed and is operational.\n\nBetween the Westpark Tollway and I-69/US 59, Fort Bend County has constructed toll overpasses at nine locations along Highway 99. Motorists are charged around 35¢ to use each overpass, or can bypass the toll by using the current roadway through the signalized intersections. Overpasses between I-69/US 59 and US 90-Alt opened on February 27, 2014, Airport Boulevard and Harlem Road on March 18, 2014, and Mason Road and Bellfort Street on March 30, 2014. The rest of the tolled overpasses to I-10/US 90 opened in late April 2014.\n\nA TXDOT study is currently underway for Segment D of the Grand Parkway. The study includes looking at ways to reduce traffic in the original segment of the non-tolled portion of the freeway; this includes the possibility of adding continuous feeder roads. This segment has been open since 1994 and population, and thus traffic, in the surrounding area has increased exponentially. There is no timetable on when or if any new projects will come out of this study.\n\nSeptember 2011 construction began on Segment E connecting I-10/US 90 Katy Freeway in the south to US 290/SH 6 and opened in December 2013. On June 3, 2008, the Harris County Commissioners Court voted to fast track the construction of Segment E with construction to begin in 2009 and then came the addition of $150 million in Stimulus money yet still the project stalled. As with many Stimulus projects it turned out not to be \"shovel ready\" enough and the $150 million was sent back to TXDOT for use elsewhere. In 2011 the Wetlands permit from the Army Corps of Engineers was acquired. In addition, Harris County relinquishing its rights to TXDOT who will construct a Public Private Cooperative toll road. At its April 28, 2011 meeting TXDOT allocated $350 million and the construction permits were let in July 2011. On July 28, 2011 TXDOT reported that three out of four contracts for Segment E were awarded and that construction would start by early September 2011.\n\nThe multi year reconstruction of I-10/US 90 was completed in 2008 while US 290/SH 6 reconstruction was not due to even start until 2011. \" The long section of I-10/US 90 from the suburb town of Katy to just inside the I-610 loop has expanded it to handle the rapidly expanding western suburbs of Houston not just adding lanes, but also an expanded HOV with two lanes in both directions where there was one lane reversed back and forth with rush hour and a toll lane for commuters willing to pay congestion prices for the quicker ride. The idea put forth is that Segment E is toll-viable from the start meaning it would pay for itself with tolls collected because of the need to relieve traffic on US 290/SH 6 along with the continued expansion of the western suburbs. After US 290/SH 6 construction is completed and less traffic is diverting down the E Segment of the Grand Parkway; the reasoning is that the inevitable population explosion going on in the area would not just replace the lost traffic from the US 290/SH 6 completion, but increase its use.\n\nSegment F-1 connects US 290/SH 6 to Texas State Highway 249. Construction began June 2013 and was completed and opened to traffic on February 5, 2016.\n\nSegment F-2 connects Texas State Highway 249 with I-45. Construction began on Segment F-2 in June 2013. A one-mile section of frontage road lanes between I-45 and Holzwarth Road (near the ExxonMobil Campus in Spring) was completed and opened to traffic in April 2015. The remainder of Segment F-2 opened on February 5, 2016.\n\nSegment G connects I-45 with I-69/US 59 North. Construction began June 2013 and was completed and opened to traffic on March 29, 2016. An interchange with the Hardy Toll Road to the Grand Parkway was completed on July 18, 2016.\n\nTexas Transportation Commission members met in Pasadena in late June 2015, and one item on their agenda is soliciting interested builders to develop, build and maintain the next Grand Parkway segment from Interstate 69/US 59 north of Houston to Interstate 10 east of the city. The project, which began construction in the summer of 2017, is expected to cost $1.2 billion. The completion date was delayed from 2019 to the spring of 2022 due to Hurricane Harvey.\n\nSegment I-2, which opened on March 25, 2008, after five years of construction, runs from Interstate 10 east of Houston south to Business State Highway 146 in Baytown. (The former Spur 55, which ran from FM 1405 to Business 146, was renumbered SH 99 and connects with the newly constructed portion of Segment I-2 at FM 1405.)\n\nTxDOT began collecting tolls on this segment on November 1, 2011. Motorists are able to pay tolls using any of the Texas toll tag transponders (TxTag, EZ TAG or TollTag), the K-Tag (Kansas) or the Pike Pass (Oklahoma). No cash or mail payments are available on this segment. Tag reader gantries have been installed on the mainline just south of FM 565, and on the northbound entrance and southbound exit ramps at FM 565. Tolls will be $1 for two-axle vehicles.\n\nFuture sections of the Grand Parkway will be built as tollways.\nThe next sections to be constructed are Section C along with Sections H and I-1, which will include improvements/upgrades to the existing portions of Section I.\n\nCurrent residents who live along the Grand Parkway in Harris and Fort Bend counties (namely in the Cinco Ranch/Falcon Point areas within segment D) have noticed increased noise due to expansion of the highway, which includes construction of new overpasses as well as increased growth in the surrounding area. Sound barriers have not been constructed based on a 30+ year old environmental study. Resident petitions and protests for a new sound barrier study have not been addressed and Texas DOT claims \"This section of the Grand Parkway does not qualify for that.\" Further expansion in this area is planned to start in 2010 with two tollway lanes added in each direction.\n\nSome groups in some neighborhoods are opposing the idea of the Grand Parkway going through their neighborhoods. For instance, a group called \"United to Save Our Spring\" tried to stop the Parkway from going through a neighborhood off FM 2920. Residents in other unincorporated areas such as The Woodlands have not shown the same opposition and support the construction of the Grand Parkway, namely segments E, F-1, F-2, and G, as this would give residents living in the outer suburbs a toll road option to drive to San Antonio, Austin, northeast Texas, or Louisiana without having to drive through the city of Houston, or using Sam Houston Tollway (Beltway 8) to bypass around the city.\n\nSome residents in Brazoria County, along segment B, have voiced opposition to several of the proposed alignments. However, TxDOT has recently proposed a fifth alternative alignment to the north of Alvin. This alternative is acceptable to the opposition group Citizens Against the Grand Parkway and is likely to encounter much less opposition from the community.\n\nThe controversial segment A, which would stretch from Texas State Highway 146 to Interstate 45 southeast of Houston through a very developed area, has not been fully designed yet. Texas Highway 146 is a possible route of the highway during segment A, but TxDOT has released plans for the highway to intersect I-45 from the west at its intersection with FM-646. If the highway continued south on Highway 146 to its intersection with FM 646 (Supposing the highway was built along the route of FM-646), it would eventually have to pass through the town of Kemah, which could not support a large highway unless many businesses were destroyed.\n\n\n\n"}

He married Helen (\"Marsie\") Watt, daughter of James Watt, \"one of the richest men in New Zealand\", in 1897. He was a keen cricketer, who played one first-class match for Hawke's Bay and constructed a cricket ground, \"The Grove\", on his property, which is still in use. He helped the Hawke's Bay Cricket Association bring out leading English professionals, including Albert Trott and Jack Board, to coach local players. He also developed the Lowry property, which had been largely a sheep and cattle farm, into one of New Zealand's leading racehorse studs. His most prominent success was the mare Desert Gold, who won her first 19 races and finished with 36 wins from 59 starts.\n\nThomas Henry and Marsie had five children between 1898 and 1904: Tom, Jim (who won a tennis Blue at Cambridge University before returning to run part of Okawa), Ralph (Rugby union Blue at Cambridge, another Lowry farmer, and the author of the book \"Taihape, Be Happy, Die Happy\"), Gertrude (known as \"Beet\") (who married Tom's Cambridge University friend Percy Chapman, who captained the English Test cricket team) and Marion (who married Reg Bettington, Oxford University cricket captain and later medical specialist in New Zealand).\n\nLowry was educated at home until he was 10, when he was enrolled at Heretaunga School for boys in Hastings, where he received cricket coaching from Jack Board.

There he captained the cricket first XI in 1915 and 1916 and the Rugby first XV in 1916, as well as winning the school's heavyweight boxing title. His cricket coaches at Christ's College were three New Zealand representatives, James Lawrence, Harold Lusk and Tom Carlton. He also won prizes for Greek, Latin and English.\n\nAiming to join the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, Lowry learned to fly in Auckland in 1917 and 1918. He then went to England, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Air Force in February 1919, three months after the end of the war.\n\nWhile in Auckland, Lowry played club cricket and was selected to play for Auckland against Wellington in January 1918 as a wicket-keeper. Auckland lost, but Lowry scored 28 and 10 (only one Auckland player scored more) and made two catches and a stumping.\n\nHe stayed in England after being demobilised. His family arrived in England in 1920 in order that the three boys should go to Cambridge and the two girls to finishing school. Before starting his first term at Jesus College, Cambridge, Lowry toured North America with the Incogniti cricket team in August and September 1920, a team that included the 19-year-old Douglas Jardine.\n\nDespite his clear cricketing skills, Lowry struggled to establish himself in what was then an excellent first-class side in his first two years at Cambridge, and did not earn his Blue. He did, however, play some games for Somerset, although his qualification to do so was obscure. The story is told that his birthplace was said to be Wellington, without mentioning that it was not the Somerset market town but the city in New Zealand; in fact, this was how Somerset had skirted the regulations for Peter Randall Johnson before World War I.\n\nIn 1922–23 Lowry was selected to tour with Archie MacLaren's MCC side to Australia and New Zealand. In the three matches against New Zealand he made 54, 61, 13 and 130, his first century in first-class cricket, in 167 minutes. In 1923 he began the season by scoring 161 in 170 minutes for Cambridge University against Lancashire, finally clinching his place in the university side. In his most productive season, playing for Cambridge, Somerset, and the Gentlemen at Lord's, he scored 1564 runs at an average of 35.54.\n\nLowry was captain of Cambridge in 1924, leading them to victory in the annual match against Oxford University at Lord's. Digby Jephson wrote of his captaincy: \"There was no fuss – no needless shifting of a well-placed field, no hesitation. One could feel in the pavilion the strong magnetic influence of one man over ten.\" He again toured North America with the Incogniti after the English season.\n\nAlthough Lowry achieved his BA degree in history, he was more interested in the extracurricular activities that Cambridge University life offered than in study. He used to employ a cramming tutor in third term to make up for the work he had not done in first and second terms.\n\nThe family returned to New Zealand late in 1924, all three brothers having got their Cambridge degrees. Tom bought two farms, of 2700 acres and 6000 acres, not far from Okawa, which he farmed until 1944, when his father died and Tom inherited Okawa.\n\nPlaying in a local cricket match for Moawhango against Taihape in December 1924 Lowry took 9 for 6, including four wickets in successive balls. Although he had played no first-class cricket in the 1924–25 season, Lowry was selected in the New Zealand team that toured Australia in 1925–26. He played in all four first-class matches, and scored 123 against South Australia in only 90 minutes.\n\nThe New Zealand Cricket Council decided to send a team for a full-season tour of England in 1927. Lowry at last made his Plunket Shield debut in 1926–27, playing for Wellington, and finished at the top of the Shield averages with 257 runs at 64.25. Although he was not captain of Wellington, he was selected to captain the New Zealand side on its most important tour so far.\n\nThe first first-class match was against the MCC at Lord's. In a high-scoring draw, Lowry scored 106 and 63 not out. The first victory came in the sixth match, when Lowry scored 105 \"at a run-a-minute\" and the New Zealanders easily beat Sussex.\n\nSix players, including Lowry, scored over 1000 runs on the tour. Lowry came third in both aggregates and averages, with 1277 runs at 38.69. While the team's batting performed well, the bowling, apart from the leg-spinners Bill Merritt and Roger Blunt, was often ineffective. Lowry used frequent bowling changes in order to unsettle the batsmen. Although he was the team's reserve wicket-keeper, he often brought himself on for a few overs of his medium pace. His specialty was a surprise full toss at the batsman's chest. He took 15 wickets on the tour as well as making 20 catches and five stumpings.\n\nThe team played 26 first-class matches, winning seven, losing five and drawing 14.\n\nIn 1927–28 Lowry scored 317 runs at 63.40 in the Plunket Shield, coming second in the national aggregates and averages and helping Wellington to the championship. In the last match of the competition he made 181, his highest score, in a 276-run victory over Auckland. He captained New Zealand in the two representative matches against the touring Australian team in 1927–28. He took over the captaincy of Wellington in 1928–29, scoring 251 runs at 50.20, and leading the team to second place. In the lead-up to New Zealand's first Test series against England in 1929–30 he led Wellington to victory in the Plunket Shield, scoring 255 runs at 42.50.\n\nIn the First Test Lowry was out for a second-ball duck in the first innings, but top-scored in the second with 40, the last batsman out as New Zealand tried unsuccessfully to set England a challenging target. The other three Tests were drawn. Lowry again top-scored in the Fourth Test, scoring 80 and adding 100 for the seventh wicket with Herb McGirr to take the side to safety.\n\nLowry scored 272 runs at 47.33 in the 1930–31 Plunket Shield, but Wellington finished third.\n\nLowry was appointed to captain the New Zealand team to tour England in 1931. At a time of financial difficulty for New Zealand cricket he was also asked to manage the side, and was given only 14 players for the four-month tour.\n\nEarly in the tour the New Zealanders beat a strong MCC side by an innings. New Zealand batted first, Lowry scoring a brisk century. Rain allowed only 106 overs on the first two days, and Lowry declared before the third and final day began. Ian Cromb then took 6 for 46 with his pace bowling to dismiss MCC for 132, but when Lowry enforced the follow-on with only 170 minutes of play left, he gave the ball instead to the leg-spinner Bill Merritt, who proceeded to take 7 for 28 in nine overs and dismiss MCC for 48.\n\nThe only scheduled Test resulted in a high-scoring and close-fought draw after Lowry declared New Zealand's second innings. In response to public demand the English cricket authorities added two more Tests. In the Second Test, however, the New Zealanders were overwhelmed by an innings. Lowry top-scored in the first innings with a defiant 62 on a difficult wicket, an innings which the New Zealand journalist Budge Hintz described as \"an exhibition of pluck and determination as inspiring as the game can provide\". The Third Test was washed out after only three hours' play. It was Lowry's last Test.\n\nIn the tour overall Lowry scored 1290 runs at 31.46, coming fourth in both aggregates and averages, made 29 catches and six stumpings, as well as taking 15 wickets at 18.26 with what \"Wisden\" called \"his weird bowling theories\".\n\nAfter the tour, Pelham Warner said Lowry was \"the best skipper to tour England since the Australian Monty Noble in 1909\". R.C. Robertson-Glasgow said Lowry was \"a remarkable cricketer, strong, versatile, courageous, original, and a leader in a thousand\".\n\nLowry announced his retirement from international cricket after the tour. He led Wellington to another Plunket Shield victory in 1931–32 but made only 53 runs himself in three matches. He captained Wellington twice more in 1932–33, then retired.\n\nIn 1933 Lowry married a neighbour, Margot Russell, one of three daughters of General Sir Andrew Hamilton Russell, the commander of the New Zealand Division in World War I. They had two girls and two boys: Ann (born in 1934), Tom (1936), Pat (1938) and Carol (1943).\n\nLowry continued to play club cricket. In a minor match in Taihape in December 1933 his team needed 69 runs to win in 18 minutes, and they won by 10 wickets, Lowry scoring 67 not out. In 1935–36 he captained a team from Rangitikei in a Hawke Cup match, top-scoring in both innings. He was asked to manage the 1937 team to tour England, doubling as reserve wicket-keeper. Margot travelled with him. While on tour they were invited to attend the coronation of George VI in Westminster Abbey. In 12 matches Lowry scored 409 runs at 27.26 and made eight catches and 12 stumpings. He scored his last first-class century, 121, with 18 fours and a six, against Nottinghamshire.\n\nLowry later served as President of the New Zealand Cricket Council between 1950 and 1953.\n\nJack Phillipps, a New Zealand cricket administrator from the 1920s to the 1960s, said Lowry was New Zealand's best captain in that period: \"If you put 11 players through a gate on to a cricket field and Tom Lowry was one of them, I think most people would say, 'Well, there's the skipper.' He had that sort of air of command about him.\"\n\nIn 1996, Lowry was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nHaving been too young to fight in World War I, Lowry tried to enlist in the army at the outbreak of World War II but at 41 he was rejected on physical grounds. In 1942 he inherited the 80,000-acre Darr River Downs station near Longreach in Queensland.\n\nWhen Lowry took over Okawa in 1944 he carried on the racehorse stud that his father had developed. He imported the stallion Faux Tirage from England at a cost of 25,000 pounds. Among Faux Tirage's progeny was Straight Draw, which won the 1957 Melbourne Cup. Lowry liked single-syllable names for his horses: three of his most successful horses were Key, Mop and Game. Game won 26 races, and Key won 19 as a three-year-old. Other prominent Lowry horses included Froth, Rover, Humber, Knave and Hot Drop.\n\nLowry helped to form the New Zealand Thoroughbred Breeders Association in 1948 and served as its president from 1951 to 1965.\n\nSince Tom Lowry's death Okawa has been run by his son Tom, and grandson, also Tom. Since its founding the property has been run by five generations of Tom Lowrys.\n\n"}

Born in New York, he became a lawyer and politician in North Carolina in the 1760s. He first came to fame as the focus of hatred of the Regulators, and led anti-Regulator militia in the War of the Regulation. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, he was driven from his home in New York, and joined the British Army, recruiting other Loyalists. He served during campaigns in New England and the South. At the end of the war in 1783 he became a United Empire Loyalist, settling in Nova Scotia.\n\nFanning was appointed lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia not long after his arrival, and helped oversee the resettlement of other Loyalist refugees in the province. In 1786 he was appointed lieutenant governor of Saint John's Island, which was renamed Prince Edward Island during his tenure. He served in that post until 1813. He retired to London, where he died in 1818.\n\nEdmund Fanning was born in the Town of Southold on Long Island in the colony of New York to Captain James Fanning and Hannah Smith. Nova Scotia Governor John Parr believed Fanning was, like Parr, a Protestant Irishman, and was from Ulster and owned great estates there.\n\nHe graduated from Yale College in 1757. He then moved to the Province of North Carolina in 1761 where he read law with Attorney-General Robert Jones and settled in Hillsborough. He held several local political posts and became a protégé of colonial governor William Tryon. Fanning came into conflict with the leaders of the Regulator movement. He, along with lawyer Francis Nash, was charged with extorting money from the local residents, but was fined only a small fine. After several riots, the movement was crushed by the army of North Carolina militia led by Tryon at the Battle of Alamance on May 16, 1771.\n\nFanning followed Tryon to New York as his personal secretary. At the start of the American Revolutionary War, revolutionaries drove Fanning from his home, forcing him to seek refuge aboard in the New York harbor. After being commissioned a colonel by General William Howe, Fanning raised a regiment of Loyalists named the King's American Regiment on Staten Island, New York. He was wounded twice during the war and was credited with saving Yale from destruction by British forces during a destructive raid against New Haven led by Tryon. Fanning was granted an honorary law degree in 1803 as thanks for this action. He was later appointed to the office of surveyor general, which he retained until he fled, with other Loyalists, to Nova Scotia in 1783.\n\nFanning became lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia in that same year, serving as deputy to Governor John Parr. On November 30, 1785 he married Phebe Maria Burns. In 1786, he was appointed lieutenant governor of St. John's Island (which was later renamed Prince Edward Island) by the Home Secretary, Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, a post which he held for almost 19 years, resigning in 1805. Prince Edward Island's Government House, the official residence of the lieutenant governor, is often referred to as \"Fanningbank\" on the island, though Fanning never dwelt there. He was promoted to general of the British Army in 1808. He retired to London in 1813 and died there in 1818.\n\nDespite having several children, Fanning had no grandchildren. He had two daughters, Lady Wood, who lived near London with her mother; the other daughter married a Captain Bentwick Cumberland, a nephew of Lord Bentwick, and lived in Charlotte's Town, Prince Edward Island. He also had several prominent nephews, including the like-named explorer Edmund Fanning, the war hero Nathaniel Fanning, and the celebrated attorney John Wickham. A great nephew was James Fannin.\n"}

Mercury never publicly disclosed the song's muse, stating in an interview: \"There isn’t really any connection between the music and my life. 'Love of My Life,' for instance, I simply made up. There’s nothing personal about it.\" John Reid said the song had been written about David Minns: \"Freddie actually wrote 'Love of My Life,' for David Minns. Freddie told me that. 'Love of My Life,' was for Minns.\" \n\nAfter Queen performed the song in South America in 1981, the version from their live album \"Live Killers\" reached number 1 in the singles chart in Argentina and Brazil, and stayed in the charts in Argentina for an entire year.\n\nFreddie Mercury wrote it on the piano and guitar first, and Brian May rearranged the song for acoustic 12-string guitar for live performances, also lowering the key by a minor third. May contributed occasional guitar phrases to the original recording and played the swooping harp glissandos by pasting together multiple takes of single chords.\n\nIntroduced during the News of the World Tour in 1977, \"Love of My Life\" was such a concert favourite that Mercury frequently stopped singing and allowed the audience to take over. It was especially well received during concerts in South America, and as a result, the band released the Live Killers version of the song as a single there.\n\nAfter Mercury's death, Brian May has frequently dedicated the song to him in his own live performances. A notable exception is the Sheffield show which yielded the \"Return of the Champions\" CD and DVD. At that show, May announced that Mercury's mother was at the show and he dedicated the song to her instead. In the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour, May would sing a few lines of the song, then let the audience take over for every verse, as Mercury did. When played at the Glasgow SECC in the 2008 Cosmos Rocks tour, May dedicated the song to his own mother, who had recently died.\n\nDuring Rock in Rio 6 in 2015, Queen + Adam Lambert was one of the artists to celebrate the festival's 30th anniversary. \"Love of My Life\" had both May singing a few lines and archive footage of Mercury performing the song during the inaugural Wembley concert in 1986.\n\nThe acoustic version of the song featured on the band's 1979 album \"Live Killers\" was recorded at their concert at Festhalle Frankfurt on 2 February of that year. A shortened version was released as a single in the UK and other territories, which did not include the spoken intros and outros from the album. The liner notes for the DVD release \"Greatest Video Hits 1\" state that although the live audio is from Frankfurt, the accompanying music video that was edited to the track consisted of footage from a 1979 Tokyo concert. In fact, the footage was filmed before one of three Tokyo concerts the band played between 23–25 April. Some bits of footage from two concerts in Paris from earlier in the year are woven in. After performing the song in South America in 1981, it was this version that reached number 1 in the singles chart in Argentina and Brazil, and stayed in the charts in Argentina for an entire year.\n\n\n"}

John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland and Lord George Manners were his younger brothers. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, earning an MA in 1835.\n\nEntering politics as Member of Parliament for Stamford in 1837, Manners became known as a voluble, if not particularly talented, protectionist. He briefly held office as a Lord of the Bedchamber to Prince Albert from 1843 to 1846.\nFollowing the resignation of Lord George Bentinck from the leadership of the protectionists in the House of Commons at the beginning of 1848, Granby (as he was then known) became leader on 10 February 1848, as Benjamin Disraeli was unacceptable to Lord Derby, the overall leader of the party, and the majority of the rank and file. \nGranby resigned on 4 March 1848, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without an actual leader in the Commons for the remainder of the parliamentary session.\n\nAt the start of the next session, affairs were handled by the triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and J. C. Herries. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851. He also declined to join the First Derby Ministry in 1852, and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire instead. Granby succeeded to the dukedom of Rutland on the death of his father in 1857. \nHe was made a Knight of the Garter in 1867. \nHe also succeeded his father as Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire, which post he held until his death on 4 March 1888, at the age of 72.\n\nRutland never married. He had cherished a passion for Mary Anne Ricketts, later Lady Forester, but his father forbade the two to marry.

Hush first appeared in \"Batman\" #609 (January 2003) as part of the 12-issue storyline \"\". He was created by Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee. The character serves as a former friend-turn-criminal foil personality to the Dark Knight Detective.\n\nThe character has been portrayed in live-action as a kid by Cole Vallis and Gordon Winarick in \"Gotham\", and by Gabriel Mann in the first season of \"Batwoman\" which marks the first live-action appearance of the Hush persona. Warren Christie portrays the character disguised as Bruce Wayne.\n\nHush resurfaced in \"\", and later in \"Detective Comics\" and \"\". He was also the architect behind several of the events of \"Batman Eternal\".\n\nDr. Thomas \"Tommy\" Elliot was a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne, and was also born into a wealthy family. The two boys often played a Stratego-esque minifigure game together, and Tommy taught Bruce to think like his opponents and to use their abilities against them in order to win, which proved useful years later when he became Batman. Thus, as a child, Tommy exhibits a genius level intellect due to his capability to think and plan strategically. Tommy despised both his abusive father and his frail, submissive mother, who came from poverty and willingly endured every abuse dealt to her and her son to keep her lavish lifestyle. For all their failings, however, Tommy's parents made sure he was well-educated, in particular teaching him about the philosophy of Aristotle, which he often quotes.\n\nDriven by his desire for independence and wealth, Tommy severed the brake line of his parents' car, causing a crash that killed his father and injured his mother; his mother, however, was saved in an emergency operation by Dr. Thomas Wayne, which enraged young Elliot. While at a summer camp with Bruce, Tommy attacked a boy and ended up in a psychiatric ward; he blamed Bruce and his mother for his outburst. He is released by an intern named Jonathan Crane, who becomes the villain Scarecrow.\n\nDuring the next few years, Tommy tended to his mother. When Bruce's parents were murdered, Tommy resented him for inheriting the Wayne family fortune, just as he had hoped to do with his parents' money. Shortly before Bruce returned to Gotham City, Tommy befriended a young woman named Peyton Riley (who would later become the second Ventriloquist) – a relationship of which his mother never approved. When Tommy's mother recovered from cancer, she disowned him, subsequently cutting him off from the Elliot family fortune in retaliation for his continuing relationship with Peyton. As a result, Tommy murdered her by smothering her with a pillow, while Peyton killed their lawyer and destroyed Mrs. Elliot's new will. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, his mother had died of a household accident.\n\nFinally the sole recipient of his family's fortune, Tommy abandoned Peyton and began traveling the world, as Bruce had. Although he went on to Harvard University and became a successful surgeon, Tommy continued to harbor an irrational grudge towards his childhood friend.\n\nAt some point in his career, Edward Nygma, also known as the Riddler, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and eventually hijacked one of Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pits to regain his health. During this mystical treatment, which renders the participant temporarily insane, the Riddler experienced an unexpected epiphany: he realized that Bruce Wayne was Batman. Soon afterwards, the Riddler attempted to sell Tommy the secrets of his newfound revelation in exchange for a large cash sum. Tommy, by this time having discovered Nygma's criminal background, instead offered to pay him to kill Bruce. Realizing that they shared a common hatred for Wayne, Tommy and the Riddler decided to pool resources to bring him down.\n\nTo this end, Elliot created for himself the persona of \"Hush\". Riddler said that the name started out as a joking reference to the need to keep Tommy's identity secret, but became a more permanent alias when Scarecrow started to sing the lullaby \"Hush, Little Baby\".\n\nIn their attempt to destroy Batman, Hush and the Riddler manipulated several other villains into unwillingly helping them. These included the Joker, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, Killer Croc and Clayface. They even manipulated some of Batman's closest allies (Superman, Huntress, and Catwoman) against the Dark Knight, utilizing such methods as Poison Ivy using her pheromones to control the Man of Steel and Catwoman and Hush's seemingly benevolent funding of Huntress's vigilante activities. Part of their plot included fooling Bruce into believing the Joker had murdered Tommy; Clayface shapeshifted into Tommy's corpse in order to create this illusion.\nWith these villains as their pawns, Hush and the Riddler set up an elaborate plot against Batman. Jason Todd, who was believed to be dead for years, entered the pact with the villains and gave them insights on how Batman thought. Using the shapeshifting abilities of Clayface, they created a decoy of the former Robin; Hush collaborated with Riddler, Todd, and Clayface to use the Dark Knight's guilt over his ward's apparent death against him at Todd's gravesite.\n\nAround this time, Hush cured the disfigured Harold Allnut, a longtime associate of Batman. In return, Harold 'bugged' the Batcave with several devices that altered Batman's mind, but nevertheless remained loyal to the Caped Crusader; he was certain that Batman would triumph over whatever followed. Hush then killed Harold in front of Batman, and immediately engaged the Dark Knight in battle. Batman was at first disoriented by Hush's quoting of Aristotle, prompting him to briefly wonder if Hush is Maxie Zeus. He noticed that Hush used Deadshot's two-gun fighting style, and theorized that he was either the assassin himself or one of his protégés.\n\nWhen Tommy finally revealed himself to a worn-out Batman, the Dark Knight was saved only by the intervention of Harvey Dent, whose Two-Face persona had been unwittingly wiped out by Tommy when he repaired Dent's disfigured face. Once again on the side of the law, Dent shot Hush twice, throwing him off a bridge.\n\nAlthough Batman was sure that Hush was his childhood friend Thomas Elliot, he was not able to unmask him.\n\nStill out to destroy Batman and determined not to let the rest of the villains get in his way, Hush quickly carved out a niche for himself, beating his former accomplice the Riddler to within an inch of his life. Hush even drives the Joker out of the city, thus proving to the Clown Prince that Hush can be a threat to him. He also temporarily killed Poison Ivy during a failed attempt to recruit her.\nFollowing a short-lived alliance with JLA nemesis Prometheus, Hush began to torment Bruce Wayne with help from Clayface. Exploiting the latter's shapeshifting abilities, Hush was briefly able to shed doubt on his true identity and had Alfred Pennyworth framed for murder, using samples taken from the new Clayface to infect Alfred with a virus that would allow Elliot to control him. Hush also attempted to analyse samples taken from Clayface with the goal of duplicating Clayface's shape-shifting abilities for himself without the usual side-effects such as loss of a default human form, eventually attempting to perfect this analysis by releasing Cassius Payne from prison, reasoning that samples from Cassius would be more useful as he is the only 'pure' Clayface... the only one who was never human in the first place. After Clayface realised that he was being manipulated, he provided Batman with a sample of himself to find a cure for Alfred's condition despite knowing that this would not leave Batman with time to cure him, and also ensured that Alfred's name would be cleared by ensuring that his final appearance after death would be a form whose fingerprints so closely resembled Alfred's that the detectives would assume that they had made a mistake (The aforementioned events occur in issue #50–55 and #61–72).\n\nThe Joker eventually returned to Gotham City with an army of trained pigeons and retaliated (in \"\" #73–74). He captured Hush and kept him sedated for three weeks, during which time he implanted a pacemaker into his body, effectively gaining control of his heart. At the Joker's mercy and unable to remove the device himself, Hush turned to the one man he felt he could trust (or rather, predict): Bruce Wayne.\n\nBruce consented to help Hush on the condition that he allow himself to be treated in, and confined to, Arkham Asylum. Hush agreed, and then immediately escaped after being told that the surgery had been a success. He was intercepted by Batman before he could confront the Joker and demanded that Batman allow him to kill the Joker. Batman seemed to agree and began to leave, but then revealed that he had tricked Hush – the pacemaker was still in his body, and he had been allowed to escape from Arkham. At that moment, the Joker arrived, and Hush begged Batman not to leave him.\n\nThe issue (and the \"Batman: Gotham Knights\" series) ended unresolved. Hush returned in the later \"Man-Bat\" miniseries, and is later shown remembering how painful it was to remove the pacemaker alone, and how the time between \"Gotham Knights\" and \"Heart of Hush\" was mostly spent recovering from the damage suffered, confirming that Batman did desert Hush at the conclusion of \"Payback\".\n\nHush returned in \"Detective Comics\" #846-#850, in the story \"Heart of Hush\", which tied together with \"Batman R.I.P.\". In this arc, set a few nights before the events depicted in \"R.I.P.\", Hush was portrayed in a slightly different thematic fashion than in his prior appearances. His past as a surgeon was made into a major aspect of his modus operandi. In the first issue, Hush revealed that his return was hastened when he began to hear whispers of the Black Glove's upcoming attack on Batman. Believing that it was his right and his right alone to kill Batman, Hush sought to beat the Black Glove to the punch. In the second part, Hush teamed up with the Scarecrow. He performed routine plastic surgery on his own face, only later revealing the result was nigh identical to Bruce Wayne.\n\nHush then ambushed and subdued Catwoman after she scratched off a portion of his facial bandages, recoiling in horror at what she saw. He then cut out her heart, putting her on life support supplied by Mr. Freeze, and delivered her to Gotham General Hospital. To himself, Hush thought about how he had begun formulating his plan after Batman had abandoned him.\n\nWhile Catwoman was left in Doctor Mid-Nite's care, Batman squeezed the location of Hush's headquarters from Scarecrow. Hush ambushed Batman by showing him the room containing Catwoman's heart, alive and pumping, at which time he pumped Batman with a paralyzing gas. He then confessed to Batman his plan: using his newfound resemblance to Bruce, he would kill and disfigure him to steal his identity, eliminating those who knew him best and would regularly interact with Bruce, and then he would retire with the Wayne fortune, reasoning that the other heroes would accept that Batman had earned the right to end his career.\n\nHowever, Batman was able to stave off the effects of the paralysis gas, recover Catwoman's heart, and warn Alfred of Hush's deception. Although Alfred disarmed Elliot, Hush managed to get into the Batcave where he nearly killed Batman, but Alfred's continuing interference and the arrival of Nightwing and Robin turned the tide. Hush retreated on the Whirly-Bat (a one-man helicopter), but his bandages became tangled in the rotor and it exploded.\n\nBatman, Nightwing, and Robin could find no trace of Hush, save some bloody bandages, and concluded that he was dead. Catwoman, not taking chances and seeking some form of closure for her predicament and current condition (Doctor Mid-Nite made it clear that it was unlikely that she would ever regain her physical prowess), had Oracle, Holly Robinson, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn and Slam Bradley track down Hush's secret bank accounts and stashes of cash and cut them off. Hush, wounded but alive, limped off to plot his next move.\n\nLater, posing as Bruce Wayne, Hush traveled to Australia and Vietnam looting the cash accounts of Wayne Enterprises' subsidiaries. He was captured by Catwoman, who knew perfectly well he was not the real Bruce Wayne. She brought him to Nightwing and Robin, who kept him contained in a secret safe house. Hush, still wearing Bruce's appearance, decided to fake his surrender, waiting for the right moment to escape.\n\nIn \"Streets of Gotham\", Batman's biological son Damian Wayne visited Hush in his cell as the new Robin, and they played chess. When Damian left to deal with a new crisis, Hush surmised that Firefly was behind the attack. He noted how Gotham City had fallen apart in Batman's absence, and pondered how to use the current situation to his advantage. Hush faked experiencing spontaneous combustion, and when Alfred arrived at his cell to assist, Hush overpowered him and escaped. He then re-emerged as Bruce Wayne, claiming that he would donate a billion dollars a month to Gotham City until the financial crisis was over. Dick and Damian, along with the Outsiders and assorted other superheroes, explained to Hush that they would always watch and control him- with the other heroes acting as a 'board of directors' intended to 'supervise' his financial dealings- and that someone will always be ready to take him down if he steps out of line. With no other option available to him, Hush reluctantly agreed to play Dick Grayson's puppet, posing as Bruce Wayne, and thus keeping the public from realizing that Bruce was dead. Though this ruined his original plan to sap the Wayne fortune, Hush did not allow it to halt his scheming altogether. Hush had appeared, notably as a member of the Gotham Shield Committee, around Gotham quite frequently, often attempting to make connections. When Ra's al Ghul arrived in Gotham, promising to ruin the Wayne family in retaliation against Red Robin, he immediately sought out Hush. Faced with the prospect of Hush using Ra's al Ghul's support to turn on the Bat-family again, Tim Drake activated a contingency plan set in place by Wayne himself to transfer controlling interest in Wayne Enterprises to Drake \"if something should happen\". This left Hush with no official standing in the company.\n\nHush reappeared in \"Streets of Gotham\" for the story arc \"House of Hush\" beginning in #14. He attempted to push the boundaries of his new role as Bruce Wayne, such as recommending that convicted criminals be allowed back on the streets. However, this plan backfired when the criminal Jane Doe—a woman who lost her face in an accident and had resorted to cutting off the faces of others—became obsessed with 'Bruce Wayne' after he had her released. She infiltrated his life by taking the face of his new assistant, and subsequently cut off Elliot's new face with the intention of becoming Bruce Wayne herself. Batman caught her and Hush, and they were both sent to Arkham.\n\nDuring the events of \"\", Hush was freed from Arkham by a new villain named the Architect. As this happened, Red Robin, Nightwing, and Blackbat realized that the Elliot family was connected to a series of bombings that destroyed three historical Gotham bridges. Nightwing found Hush, who had been betrayed by the Architect and strapped to a bomb, but was forced to sacrifice Wayne Tower to save his life.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Hush first appears in issue twenty-one of \"Batman Eternal\" as the apparent mastermind behind Commissioner Gordon's downfall and Carmine Falcone's return. After injecting Alfred with fear toxin, Hush was seen communicating with Jason Bard about taking control of Gotham.\n\nIn issue twenty-six, a slightly revised origin for Hush was revealed; he was still Tommy Elliott, a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne, but in this version, his parricide is explicitly described as a way for him to get closer to Bruce (who had started distancing himself from Tommy after the death of his own parents) rather than as a way for him to receive his inheritance.\n\nHush turned public opinion against Wayne Enterprises by blowing up one of Batman's hidden weapon caches (known to be connected to Wayne Enterprises after the events of Batman Incorporated) below Gotham, killing an unknown number of civilians, policemen and military personnel. He was able to enter the cache with DNA taken from Alfred Pennyworth.\n\nAfter having blown up another weapon cache and having been shot through the shoulder with a grappling hook by Julia Pennyworth, Hush gave up his location to Batman to face him in a final showdown. They met and fought in a weapon cache below the Martha Wayne Foundation hospital, which Hush had rigged to explode as a backup plan. Batman defeated Hush, but was then informed that the government had seized control of Wayne Enterprises and its holdings due to its involvement in the catastrophic explosions around Gotham. Hush then taunted Batman, stating, \"Maybe you're right Bruce, maybe I'm not you. But right now, who would want to be?\"\n\nHush was then kept as prisoner in the Batcave, but broke out with the help of the then unknown mastermind behind the current threat. Hush proceeded to sabotage the equipment of several members of the Batman Family via the Batcomputer as they fought various villains, including crashing the Batwing with Batman still in it. He was then returned to captivity after having been ambushed by Alfred Pennyworth, Alfred harshly informing Hush that he was hardly going to be locked up in his own home.\n\nAfter DC Comics' new line-wide relaunch Rebirth, Hush first appeared in a single-panel cameo in issue 19 of \"Batman\" (vol. 3), wherein he is an inmate at Arkham Asylum and beaten up by Bane.\n\nThen, in the one-shot \"Batman: Prelude To The Wedding: Nightwing vs. Hush #1\", Hush is \"tipped off\" to Batman's upcoming wedding by the Joker. Hush attempts to attack Batman's bachelor party, causing a disaster to distract Superman and then attacking Batman and Nightwing. In the course of the confrontation, Hush's attack disrupts a dimensional gate Superman had provided that was intended to take Batman to a peaceful pocket universe, resulting in Hush and Nightwing being trapped in an in-between place for individuals who have lost all sense of individual identity. As Hush's rants affirm his inability to forge a life for himself outside of an obsession with Bruce Wayne, he reveals that he has given himself plastic surgery to look like Dick Grayson to try and recapture his old friendship with Bruce. Nightwing, despite feeling some sympathy for Hush, nevertheless leaves him behind in the pocket dimension while he escapes back home.\n\nHowever, in \"Batman\" #70, Hush is apparently back in Arkham Asylum as he is one of several villains Batman beats up during his escape after having been captured and subjected to mental torture by Scarecrow, The Flashpoint Batman and Bane. Later, Hush is shown to be a member of Bane's police force after he had taken control over the institutions of Gotham. Hush duels with Batman, but loses. He was likely kept obedient through hypnosis by the Psycho Pirate.\n\nBeing a victim of abuse and a neglectful, submissive mother rendered Thomas Elliot sociopathic. Before even his teenage years, he was already operating on a high level of sociopathy, going so far as severing the brake line of his parents' car to gain independence from them and inherit the Elliot family fortune. When Bruce Wayne's parents died and he inherited the Wayne family fortune, as well as independence, from them - the very two things Tommy sought to gain from his parents' death - Tommy developed an irrational hatred for his childhood friend, spawned from the fact Bruce's father Thomas Wayne was the one who operated on and saved his mother, foiling the young Elliot's plan of parricide, and that via the death of his parents', Bruce had gained everything he wanted. This deep-rooted hatred would then carry on into Tommy's adulthood, resulting in him adopting his Hush persona. Elliot also seems to be obsessed with mystery and subterfuge, preferring to operate from the shadows and having cast doubts over his own identity and motivations several times.\n\nThomas \"Tommy\" Elliot has spent most of his life honing his skills enough to be a match for the Dark Knight. One of the finest surgeons in Gotham City, Thomas Elliot has an incredible, genius-level intellect and is also a master planner, with tactical skills rivaling those of the Caped Crusader. Hush's greatest asset is his talent for thinking like his opponents and for using their abilities against them. Ironically, Bruce Wayne learned his strategic skills from Elliot in childhood before their respective parents' deaths.\n\nHush is an expert marksman, able to shoot two batarangs out of the air and set off C4 explosive using twin M1911 .45 caliber pistols, his weapons of choice. While not possessing the kind of martial arts training that Bruce Wayne acquired, Hush has proven his ability to fight hand-to-hand; he shows expertise and competence, being able to fight almost on par with Batman.\n\nHe has performed breakthrough medical operations, such as removing Harold Allnut's hunchback and giving him the ability to speak, repairing Harvey Dent's face, inventing a virus which accelerates Killer Croc's devolution, and tearing out Catwoman's heart without doing any lasting damage.\n\nHush is also able to perform plastic surgery on himself, using minimal anesthetic and sheer force of will. He's implied to have removed the pacemaker installed on his own heart by himself, and has shown the ability to grant himself the appearance of someone else, such as Bruce Wayne, using only a long series of planned surgeries on his own face, with the aid of a simple mirror.\n\nThomas Elliot previously had access to the vast resources of his family fortune, putting him on par with Bruce Wayne in wealth, and so he is able to fund his more expensive plans. He is also able to buy the cooperation of the main villains in Gotham, like Mr. Freeze. However, since the \"Heart of Hush\" storyline, Catwoman has tapped his resources, reducing him to poverty. He then put in motion a plan to use his newfound resemblance to Bruce Wayne to leech off the Wayne fortune, cutting off the Batman Family from it as well. This plan was thwarted when he underestimated his foes, finding himself merely a puppet of the Batman Family and their allies as he serves to create the impression that Bruce Wayne is still alive.\n\nThe 2010 \"Batman Beyond\" miniseries revealed that Bruce Wayne's last fight with Hush occurred on a rainy night and consisted primarily of a rooftop chase. As a last-minute means of escape, Elliot dove into an open window, only to be shot by the homeowner who mistook him for an invader. With Batman severely injured and not on good terms with the police, he left Hush's body without examining it himself. Bruce seemed initially satisfied with the official police identification of the body as Elliot's. However, he later admits suspecting that Hush's skill for strategy and plastic surgery could have fabricated the entire scenario.\n\nSome time after the events of \"\", Terry McGinnis discovers the former Signalman murdered in a manner reminiscent of Two-Face's M.O. He subsequently tracks the murderer to a hospital where an aged Jervis Tetch is being held and finds a bandaged man standing over a badly injured nurse. The man flees as Terry rushes over to the nurse, who says the man uttered a single word, \"Hush\".\n\nReturning to the cave, Terry learns what happened in Bruce's last fight with Hush. Terry soon discovers that the reformed villain, Armory, has been killed with sharpened umbrellas (the Penguin's weapon of choice). Attempting to stay ahead of their foe, Terry and Bruce search out the Calendar Man (Julian Gregory Day). Upon confronting Day, Terry is suddenly ambushed by Hush, who broke in beforehand.\n\nDuring Terry's fight with the new Hush, it is revealed that this Hush is not only capable of matching the current Batman in a fight, but is also aware of Bruce Wayne's identity as Batman. He regards Terry as an impostor with no understanding of what it means to be Batman. He also regards his murders of Batman's rogues gallery as orphaning Batman all over again by killing his enemies as the only \"loving\" family he has had.\n\nHush escapes by throwing the Calendar Man out the window with a bomb attached to Day's chest. Terry chooses to try and save Day, but fails. Confirming that Tim Drake was under constant physical and psychological observation since , Terry eliminates Drake as a suspect and proceeds to confront Dick Grayson.\n\nMeanwhile, Hush is revealed to have hired the new Catwoman to plant a tracking device on Batman, before proceeding to strangle her as part of his vendetta. A brief scene with Amanda Waller and a woman identified as Doctor Reid suggests a connection between Project Cadmus and Hush. However, Waller insists that they keep their knowledge of this Hush quiet.\n\nUsing the new \"Bat-Wraith\" (a robot designed to replace Terry as Batman), Bruce intervenes in Hush's attempt to kill Catwoman. Hush demonstrates a knowledge of Bruce's old methods—including his equipment trials with Alfred and his habit of making the logo on his chest heavily armoured—and manages to shut down the robot. Hush then proceeds to attempt to hack the Bat-Wraith, which forces Bruce to use the self-destruct.\n\nTerry subsequently attempts to trap Hush by posing as current Bat-foe Mad Stan, only to be defeated and exposed by Hush's use of Shriek's technology. Hush unmasks himself, appearing to be a bitter and enraged Dick Grayson. He spares Bruce and Terry so that they can witness him in action \"saving\" Gotham. Bruce then directs the new Catwoman on how to treat Terry's injuries.\n\nThe new Hush is subsequently revealed as a clone of Grayson. Waller, determined to provide the world with a Batman, cloned Grayson based on DNA and memory readings taken after Grayson's last fight as Nightwing. Waller believed that Grayson was more stable than Bruce and would therefore be easier to control. Doctor Reid also reveals herself to be the granddaughter of the original Hush (Nora Elliot before her marriage), seeking to atone for her grandfather's sins.\n\nHush sends a transmission to the Batcave, revealing that he has taken control of the Bat-Wraiths. He threatens to destroy Gotham in order to save it by setting off bombs along a fault line and triggering a . The wounded Terry is aided by Dick Grayson despite Bruce and Terry's concerns about his old injuries. They are joined by Catwoman who is seeking revenge for Hush's attack on her.\n\nThe three track down Hush, but are unable to convince him that he is merely a clone. The group is only able to defeat him when Bruce temporarily overrides Hush's control of the Bat-Wraiths. Hush is then accidentally impaled and killed on a Bat-Wraith when Terry throws him off of the real Grayson, the clone being impaled by a Bat-Wraith coming out of a pit that it had previously fallen into before both fall back into the pit. Terry grimly notes that the lack of a body means they can only \"think\" the clone is dead rather than being sure of it. Waller later had Reid taking the blames for Hush's actions in order to continue her work.\n\nIn an alternate timeline where Batman saved his parents while travelling back in time, Bruce Wayne and Tommy Elliott were still friends as adults.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Hush is subsequently killed by Batman.\n\nHush appears in \"\" comic. As it turns out, Hush's new face was part of a plan that had taken the Arkham Knight years to put into action. Thinking that he was truly Bruce Wayne, Ratcatcher tried to kill him but was disappointed when Hush's bandages came off and his scars were revealed. Two Gotham cops tried to help Hush also believing that he was Wayne, but were overwhelmed by Ratcatcher's rats. Arkham Knight, who'd been following Hush, saved him from Ratcatcher and both of them escaped before Batman showed up.\n\nIn a safehouse, Hush was patched up and given a sample of Clayface mud that would heal his surgery scars on the proviso that he would not reveal his new face again until the plan was ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2145644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145644", "title": "Dawn of Mana", "text": "Dawn of Mana\n\nDawn of Mana is a 2006 action-adventure game for the PlayStation 2. It was developed and published by Square Enix. It is the eighth game of the \"Mana\" series and the third entry in the \"World of Mana\" subseries, following the release of \"Children of Mana\" nine months prior and \"Friends of Mana\" two months prior. Set in a high fantasy universe, \"Dawn of Mana\" follows a young hero, Keldric, as he journeys to close a portal to a land of darkness that has been opened in the base of the Tree of Mana and is corrupting the world.\n\nWhile it contains some small role-playing elements, \"Dawn of Mana\" diverges from the prior two-dimensional action role-playing game titles of the series to focus directly on action-adventure gameplay in a full 3D world. Incorporating the Havok physics engine, the gameplay focuses on the player grabbing and throwing objects and monsters in order to startle enemies before attacking them with a sword and magic. Keldric grows more powerful as the player journeys through an area, only to reset to his base abilities with each new zone unless difficult extra challenges are met. Unlike many of its predecessors, the game does not feature any cooperative multiplayer component.\n\n\"Dawn of Mana\" was designed, directed, and produced by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script was written by Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by a group led by Kenji Ito. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 229,000 copies in its first ten days of release in Japan, and over 410,000 copies worldwide by the end of 2008. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and lush, they found the leveling system annoying, the combat controls difficult and frustrating, and the story trite.\n\nUnlike previous games in the \"Mana\" series, \"Dawn of Mana\" takes place in a full three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous games in the series, \"Dawn\" is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player.\n\nThe combat system in \"Dawn of Mana\" is called the Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost all objects in the game, including enemies, are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. When something is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up to a maximum of four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible.\n\nThe game is divided into eight chapters and a prologue; at the end of each chapter, the player is graded on their performance, and all of their statistics and medals are reset. The only items which carry over between chapters are emblems, which are given to the player for achieving high scores in a chapter or defeating hidden monsters. High scores are achieved by defeating more enemies, and defeating enemies with high Panic meters. In addition to the main game is a challenge arena, accessible through the main menu, where Keldric can fight timed battles against powerful foes. Keldric can fight alongside AI-controlled pets in these challenges, found in eggs throughout the game. The challenge arena also contains a shop, which contains emblems, eggs, and bonuses like extra music or higher game difficulties, which can be bought with money dropped by enemies throughout the game.\n\n\"Dawn of Mana\" opens on the fictional island of Illusia, a place where the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a continent composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the labyrinth of roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.\n\nKeldric and Faye, with the help of the great beast, Flammie, force the Lorimarian army to leave the village. They chase after Stroud, catching up to him at the coast. There they free Ritzia, only to be attacked by Stroud, wielding the other part of the key—the Sword of Mana. Keldric is thrown off of Stroud's airship, and the Lorimarians invade Illusia again. Stroud opens the portal, and a wave of dark energy is released, transforming the Tree, turning the people of Illusia into monsters called Grimlies, and releasing dark monsters from Mavolia. Keldric and Faye flee, and head for Fa'Diel.\n\nA year of wandering later, the dark energy has begun to affect other countries in Fa'Diel. Keldric discovers in Jadd that Ritzia plans to release the Mavolian energy to cover the whole world. He and Faye journey back to Illusia, only to discover Ritzia seemingly possessed and saying that it is their destiny to rule the world. After she runs away, Keldric meets a masked stranger who tells him that he was the one to close the portal centuries ago, sealing up the Maiden who had opened it, Anise, inside. He also reveals that Stroud is Keldric's older brother. When Keldric and Faye reach the portal, they find Stroud and Ritzia fighting. Stroud is trying to prevent Ritzia, possessed by Anise, from destroying the world, but is being mutated by the dark energy. Keldric defeats the mutated Stroud, and then fights Ritzia. Realizing that the only way to close the portal is to defeat Anise, he is forced to kill Ritzia along with her. The spirits of Ritzia and Faye then merge with the Tree of Mana, the portal is sealed, and Illusia is restored.\n\nIn 2003, Square Enix began a drive to begin developing \"polymorphic content\", a marketing and sales strategy to \"[provide] well-known properties on several platforms, allowing exposure of the products to as wide an audience as possible\". The first of these was the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\", and Square Enix intended to have campaigns for other series whereby multiple games in different genres would be developed simultaneously. In early 2005, Square Enix announced a \"\"World of Mana\"\" project, the application of this \"polymorphic content\" idea to the \"Mana\" franchise, which would include several games across different genres and platforms. These games, as with the rest of the series, would not be direct sequels or prequels to one another, even if appearing so at first glance, but would instead share thematic connections. The third release in this project and the eighth release in the \"Mana\" series was announced in September 2005 as \"Seiken Densetsu 4\", the first 3D game in the series, though no other details were given in favor of promoting the first game, \"Children of Mana\".\n\n\"Dawn of Mana\" was designed, directed, and produced by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script was written by Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato. The main objective of the development team was to convert the entire \"Mana\" world into a 3D environment, rather than just starting from scratch graphically and adding new elements to the gameplay. Ishii had previously wanted to make the 1999 PlayStation game \"Legend of Mana\" a 3D game, but the console had been unable to handle his vision of the player interacting with natural shaped objects in a full 3D world. He wanted to create a \"Mana\" title that could explore \"the feeling of touch\" in a game. After seeing the Havok physics engine in a demo of \"Half-Life 2\" at E3 in 2004, Ishii decided to use the system in \"Dawn\" to give players a visual link between environments, objects, and characters. He hoped the physics engine and 3D graphics would allow him \"to create a world where players utilize a variety of actions to alter the world and the objects contained within\". Although Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, he has also asserted in an interview that \"Dawn\" is set ten years before \"Children of Mana\", which depicts the aftermath of the \"cataclysm\" of \"Dawn\".\n\nThe score for \"Dawn of Mana\" was composed by Kenji Ito, while Tsuyoshi Sekito and Masayoshi Soken contributed numerous tracks and Grammy Award-winning musician and film composer Ryuichi Sakamoto wrote the theme song, \"Dawn of Mana\". Tracks originally composed for earlier games in the series by Ito, Hiroki Kikuta, and Yoko Shimomura were also arranged for \"Dawn of Mana\" by the main three composers. Sekito focused on the game's boss themes, while Soken worked on other battle music. Ito had previously composed the music for the first game in the \"Mana\" series, \"Final Fantasy Adventure\" (1991), as well as its 2003 remake \"Sword of Mana\", and for the 2006 \"Children of Mana\". This was the first soundtrack in the \"Mana\" series to feature work by Sekito, Soken, or Sakamoto, though Sekito and Soken had worked for Square Enix previously on other titles. The music of the game covers a range of styles, including rock, classical, and orchestral. Sakamoto drew inspiration for the theme song from the image of the Mana tree shown at the title screen of the game. The album \"Seiken Densetsu 4 Original Soundtrack -Sanctuary-\" collects 106 tracks from Children of Mana on four discs and is nearly four and a half hours in length. It was published by Square Enix on January 24, 2007. A promotional album, \"Breath of Mana\", was released along with preorders of the game in Japan on December 21, 2006. The thirteen-minute disc contains five orchestral and piano songs, all composed by Ito, three of which did not appear on the full soundtrack album.\n\n\"Dawn of Mana\" sold over 229,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006, ten days after release, and was the top-selling PlayStation 2 title in Japan during its release week. As of November 2008 it had sold over 340,000 copies in Japan. The game sold 70,000 copies in North America by November 2007.\n\nUpon its release, \"Dawn of Mana\" received generally poor reviews over a wide range, with numerical scores that range from 30 to 80 out of 100. Reviewers praised \"Dawn of Mana\"'s graphics and character design; GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd called it colorful and \"pretty\", and praised the particle effects, while a reviewer for GameTrailers noted the \"gorgeous in-game cinematics\". Gabe Graziani of GameSpy also called out the cinematics in his review, calling them \"beautifully rendered and animated\" and the highlight of the game. IGN's Jeff Haynes liked the scale and variety of the 3D environments and called out the character models as worthy of praise. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com, however, described the level design as \"chaotic\" despite the \"charming, candy-coated graphics\". Joe Juba and Matt Miller of \"Game Informer\" said that the environments are \"pretty bland\", but praised the rest of the graphics heavily. Michael Beckett of RPGamer said that \"Dawn of Mana's visual style is highly impressive\" and especially praised the character design and color palette. The music was also praised; VanOrd called it \"the highlight of the sound design\" and the GameTrailers reviewer claimed that \"Dawn of Mana\" had a \"lush soundtrack filling every moment of the game\". Beckett also praised the music, and noted the callbacks in the largely orchestral score to previous games in the \"Mana\" series.\n\nThe gameplay was heavily criticized by reviewers such as Fitch of 1UP.com, who disliked both the way the character abilities reset with every new area and the \"inane\" and \"mundane\" system for collecting emblems, criticisms echoed by GameSpot's VanOrd. The GameTrailers review added that the way the character's levels and abilities reset in each area \"zaps the sense of accomplishment from the game as a whole\". Haynes of IGN also found issues with the targeting system for attacking enemies at range, finding it ineffective, and also criticized the leveling system and the game's map. Graziani of GameSpy felt the targeting system was one of the worst parts of \"Dawn of Mana\", along with the camera system—a complaint also raised by Haynes. Both Fitch and VanOrd focused their criticisms of the controls on the Havok physics engine, which they felt was poorly utilized and left the player feeling out of control—unable to aim when throwing objects or easily control the character during the game's jumping sections. Juba of \"Game Informer\" felt that the physics engine left the controls \"laughably uncooperative\".\n\nThe game's story was also not seen as a highlight; Graziani called it \"trite\" and \"fan service\", while Fitch deemed it \"a bit of a \"Neverending Story\" rip-off\", though a charming one. Beckett of RPGamer called it \"a somewhat trite tale of boy chases girl\" and noted \"a general lack of closure to the story\". Juba of \"Game Informer\", however, deemed it an \"interesting plot\". Both the GameTrailers review and VanOrd praised the \"charm\" of the characters, though VanOrd noted that they were making up for an unoriginal plot. Overall, several reviewers felt that \"Dawn of Mana\" was a divergence from the rest of the series that did not add as much as it took away; even the notably high-scoring Japanese \"Famitsu\" review felt that the change in gameplay would confuse fans and other players.\n"}

The story is set before the first seven books in the series, and follows the early days of the title character's journalism career. Fletch scores his first big interview, only to have the subject turn up dead in the newspaper's parking lot. He investigates, beginning his dual profession of journalist and investigator.\n\nA film adaptation of the novel has been in development for some time with a number of different persons attached.\n\nDuring what is effectively a prequel, Fletch has only been at the News-Tribune as a junior reporter for a short time and Frank (his editor) is losing respect for his new employee. Frank moves Fletch to a different section of the newspaper more than once, but Fletch continues to cause trouble. When Fletch is to run the story of local lawyer Donald Habeck, who requests an interview in order to announce that he is giving 5 million dollars to a local museum, the lawyer turns up dead in the News-Tribune parking lot.\n\nUnsurprisingly Frank takes Fletch off the story and gives it to an experienced reporter who has been with the paper for years. Fletch is now charged with investigating a whorehouse—which he does. However, he is not about to give up on the Habeck story, the circumstances of which seem mighty suspicious, especially when Fletch starts to suspect that the legal firm Habeck worked for is one of the most crooked firms around.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2005 Dr. Shazia was an employee of Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), and working at the company's Sui hospital for the past 18 months while living alone in accommodation provided by PPL. Security services for the entire facility was provided by the Defence Services Group (DSG). She had taken the job only after PPL had also promised a job for her husband. The job, however, never materialised.\n\nOn the night of 2 January and in the early morning hours of 3 January 2005, Dr. Shazia was awoken by somebody pulling her hair. She was then strangled with a cord, threatened, blindfolded, pistol-whipped, beaten and repeatedly raped by a masked intruder, at Sui, Dera Bugti, in the heavily guarded government-owned natural gas plant. She was severely injured in the attack but managed to cut her hands free of the cord and sought help from a nurse, Sakina, at the nearby nursing hostel. Sakina then informed the administration of PPL and the DCMO; the medical staff on duty, Dr Mohammad Ali, Dr Irshad, Dr Saima Siddiqui, nurse Firdous and Salimullah visited Dr. Shazia. Her pleas to contact her husband (who was working in Libya at the time) and her family were ignored. Instead of treating her medically, officials were said to have drugged her into unconsciousness with sedatives for three days to keep her quiet and then transferred her to a psychiatric hospital, Asghar Psychiatric Hospital, in Karachi.\n\nHer husband, Khalid, in Libya at the time, rushed back to Pakistan to be reunited with his wife. With his support, Shazia reported the crime.\n\nFollowing the report, for a period of 2 months, she was put under house arrest in a house in Karachi under the \"unofficial protection\" of the police, army and Musharraf officials and was not allowed access to doctors, lawyers or visitors of her choice. In addition, the crime scene and anything that could be considered as evidence, including the clothes of Dr. Shazia, were tampered with or destroyed. When her family was informed some days later, Dr. Shazia and her family were told to keep quiet and dissuaded to register the rape case or speak to the media by the PPL Company representatives, who denied the rape to the media.\n\nHer husband Khalid said, his grandfather demanded that Khalid divorce her, because he felt, her rape had rendered her a stain on the family honour. Khalid refused. So the grandfather assembled a mob to kill Shazia.\n\nHer case led to a violent uprising by the Bugti tribe in Baluchistan province, disrupting the supply of gas to much of the country for several weeks. By some accounts, up to 10,000 soldiers and police were brought in to quell the rebellion. As the Pakistani authorities attacked the Bugti, President Musharraf promised that the tribesmen would \"not know what hit them.\" and attacks on the Bugti tribesmen were intensified.\n\nAn unusual development occurred, when the then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf entered the controversy, stating on national television, that the accused officer, named as Captain Hammad, was \"not guilty\", which led to criticism of Musharraf, a military man himself. Both politicians as well as Pakistani human rights lawyer, Asma Jahangir voiced their criticism and concerns following the statement.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Dr. Shazia said that she was threatened many times. \"I cannot tell you how many times I was threatened. My life was made impossible. I am still terrified.\" \"My whole career was destroyed, as was my husband's. That was why we left our country.\" \"Instead of getting justice, I was hounded out of Pakistan. I never wanted to leave Pakistan, but had no choice.\"\n\nDr. Shazia and her husband alleged that the authorities threatened them and ordered them to leave the country.\n\nOn 18 March 2005 Shazia and her husband, Dr. Shazia, left Pakistan on a flight to London, The United Kingdom. She applied for asylum in Canada, where she has relatives, but her application was refused. In August 2005 New York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof wrote several articles about Dr. Shazia's story and urged readers to write to the Canadian minister of citizenship and Immigration asking the Canadian government to reconsider. As of 26 September 2005, Dr. Shazia was still stranded in the UK awaiting the result of her application for asylum in the UK. She expressed great regret in being forced to leave her country, her adopted son and family, her career and life behind for a future unknown.\n\nDr. Shazia Khalid's story is covered in Terence McKenna's documentary about sexual violence in Pakistan, \"Land, Gold and Women\". In the interview with McKenna Shazia was quoted saying \"I did not get justice and I will regret that for the rest of my life\" on 28 February 2006.\n\nShazia Khalid has since become a spokesperson about the social and legal challenges women face in Pakistan today and advocate of women's human rights.\n\nAnother rape case was reported in September 2008, where a widow resident named, Firdaus Bibi, was gang-raped in the Pakistan Petroleum Limited Colony at Sui and a case was registered against nine officials of the PPL and Defence Security Guards (DSG) in this connection according to the police sources from Dera Bugti.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2145666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145666", "title": "Toxodon", "text": "Toxodon\n\nToxodon (meaning \"bow tooth\") is an extinct genus of South American mammals from the Late Miocene to early Holocene epochs (Mayoan to Lujanian in the SALMA classification) (about 11.6 million to 11,000 years ago). It is a member of Notoungulata, one of several now extinct orders of hoofed mammals indigenous to South America. It was among the largest and last members of its order, and was probably the most common large-hoofed South American mammal of its time.\n\nCharles Darwin was one of the first to collect \"Toxodon\" fossils, after paying 18 pence for a \"T. platensis\" skull from a farmer in Uruguay. In \"The Voyage of the Beagle\" Darwin wrote, \"November 26th - I set out on my return in a direct line for Monte Video. Having heard of some giant's bones at a neighbouring farm-house on the Sarandis, a small stream entering the Rio Negro, I rode there accompanied by my host, and purchased for the value of eighteen pence the head of the \"Toxodon\".\" Since Darwin discovered that the fossils of similar mammals of South America were different from those in Europe, he invoked many debates about the evolution and natural selection of animals.\n\nIn his own words, Darwin wrote down in his journal, \"\"Lastly, the Toxodon, perhaps one of the strangest animals ever discovered: in size it equaled an elephant or megatherium, but the structure of its teeth, as Mr. Owen states, proves indisputably that it was intimately related to the Gnawers, the order which, at the present day, includes most of the smallest quadrupeds: in many details it is allied to the Pachydermata: judging from the position of its eyes, ears, and nostrils, it was probably aquatic, like the Dugong and Manatee, to which it is also allied. How wonderfully are the different Orders, at the present time so well separated, blended together in different points of the structure of the Toxodon!\"\"\n\nAnalysis of collagen sequences obtained from \"Toxodon\" as well as from \"Macrauchenia\" found that South America's native notoungulates and litopterns form a sister group to perissodactyls, making them true ungulates. This finding has been corroborated by an analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from a \"Macrauchenia\" fossil, which yielded a date of 66 Ma for the time of the split with perissodactyls.\n\nIn 2014, a study identifying a new species of toxodontid resolved the phylogenetic relations of the toxodontids, including to \"Toxodon\". The below cladogram was found by the study:\n\n\"Toxodon\" was about in body length, with an estimated weight up to and about high at the shoulder and resembled a heavy rhinoceros, with a short and vaguely hippopotamus-like head. Because of the position of its nasal openings, it is believed that \"Toxodon\" had a well-developed snout. It had a massive skeleton, which suggests that it supported a large muscular body. It had short stout legs with three functional toes, with most of the body weight being borne by the central toe.\n\nThe vertebrae were equipped with high apophyses, which most likely supported the massive weight and muscles as well as its powerful head. \"Toxodon\" had broad jaws which were filled with bow shaped teeth and incisors. These teeth would have allowed the animal to tear through and bite off plants and leaves.\n\nIt was initially believed to have been amphibious, but after examining the proportions of the femur and tibia, as well as the position of its head, below the top of the spinal column, palaeontologists realized that it had features similar to terrestrial animals such as elephants or rhinoceroses. The fossils are also usually found in arid and semi-arid areas, typically an indication of a primarily terrestrial life.\n\n\"Toxodon\" would have had a very unusual gait, due to its peculiar proportions. It may have galloped to escape predators, but like a rhino, it probably relied more on its size as protection against predators.\n\n\"Toxodon\" became extinct at the beginning of the Holocene, previous mid-Holocene dates are now thought to be in error.\n\nFossils of \"Toxodon\" have been found in:\n\n\n\n"}

The Stellar was launched in July 1983. The Stellar was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, but the chassis from the Cortina Mk V was kept.\n\nThe engine and transmission were licensed from Mitsubishi Motors. Engines available were 1.4 L (4G33, same as the Hyundai Pony) and 1.6 L (4G32) inline-fours until 1986, using either a KM119 4- or 5-speed manual or a Borg-Warner 03-55L 3-speed automatic) and a 2.0 L engine for 1987. Trim levels included L (base), GL/CL/SL, and CXL/GSL. The CXL/GSL featured power windows, locks and mirrors; remote fuel door, remote trunk, premium sound system, full instrumentation (speed, tach, fuel, water temp, volts, and oil pressure), headlamp washers and available air conditioning, a rather surprising list of features for the year and type of car. The Stellar's Ford genes and conventional design led many British observers to compare it with the then recently discontinued Cortina - where conservative buyers were scared off by the Sierra's radical styling, a fact played upon by Hyundai's advertising agency with print advertisements depicting a jelly/jello mold shaped like the Sierra, above a picture of the Stellar. Like the Cortina, the Stellar also has wishbone suspension up front with a coil sprung live rear axle.\n\nAs well as being comparable to the Cortina, which had been Britain's best selling car, it also found favour with buyers due to its competitive asking price, which meant that it was priced comparably to a smaller Escort rather than a Sierra. It was sold in Britain from June 1984 until the arrival of the Lantra during 1991. It was the second Hyundai model to be imported to Europe, two years after the launch of the smaller Pony.\n\nFor 1987, the Stellar II (or Stellar 2.0 in Canada) was refreshed. Changes included a 2-way catalytic converter, new instrument cluster, larger 2.0 L Mitsubishi 4G63 engine (SOHC with eight valves) with a feedback two-barrel carburetor, higher output alternator, larger headlights and restyled taillights. The front double wishbone suspension was changed to a MacPherson strut design, along with larger brake calipers, as well as a two-piece driveshaft. The Stellar had the option of riding on several types of aluminum alloy wheels, and was equipped standard with Michelin all-season tires (Canada). Also that year, an automatic transmission (Borg Warner 03-71) with overdrive was available as an option. In the domestic Korean market, this was the first of their cars to be sold as the Sonata. In Europe, the Stellar II is sometimes referred to as the Stellar Prima. This was only limited to the new 2.0 GSL model, thus differing from the continued 1.6 models. The 2.0 GSL \"Prima\" received new, larger bumpers, restyled lights and updated dashboard, while the 1.6 GSL kept the original design which was also continued for the 1.6 SL and 1.6 L. The 1.4 models were discontinued for the 1987 model year.\n\nThe Stellar was not available in the United States due to strict emission standards there, but it was available in Canada and other countries. In addition, the Stellar was the only inexpensive four-cylinder powered rear-wheel drive sedan after the Toyota Corolla shifted to front-wheel drive in 1984 and the Daihatsu Charmant was discontinued in 1987. The Stellar was replaced in Canada and Europe by the Hyundai New Sonata for 1992. In the Korean domestic market, the lower end of the Stellar lineup can be considered as having been replaced by the Sonata. The Stellar (along with the Pony) would be Hyundai's last rear-wheel drive cars for North America until the 2009 Genesis.\n\n\nEurope:\n\n\n"}

He also lettered in basketball, football and track.\n\nGriffin was drafted in the 21st round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft by the California Angels, and played in their minor league organization until his call-up in 1970. After 18 games with the Angels, in which he hit .127 with four RBI in 62 games, he was traded to the Red Sox in a six-player trade that sent popular outfielder Tony Conigliaro to the Angels. Griffin was the Red Sox' regular second baseman from 1971 until mid-1975. He was not a particularly good hitter, posting modest batting averages with few walks and very little power, but instead he was an excellent fielder, winning a Gold Glove Award in 1972.\n\nIn June 1975, the Red Sox acquired veteran second baseman Denny Doyle from the Angels, and for the rest of the season, the left-handed-hitting Doyle was the Red Sox' primary second baseman, with the right-handed-hitting Griffin starting only against left-handed pitchers. Griffin did not appear in the American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, and made only one brief appearance in the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nGriffin suffered numerous injuries during his professional career. On April 30, 1974, Griffin was beaned by a Nolan Ryan fastball knocking him unconscious. The beaning left him with a concussion and temporary hearing loss. On August 30, 1975, he was beaned again, this time by Oakland's Dick Bosman. Griffin experienced hearing and equilibrium problems, but recovered very quickly. This time he had been wearing an ear flap with his protective helmet. Griffin played only sparingly in 1976, and was released after playing in only five games in 1977.\n\nAfter baseball, Griffin worked in construction. First with his father in the 1970s, and later for Buddy LeRoux in the 1980s.\n\nOn July 27, 2016, Griffin died after a long illness.\n\nGriffin had two children, Natalie and Chad, and six grandchildren.\n"}

He was ranked as amateur world No. 1 in 1966 by Lance Tingay.\n\nBefore winning Wimbledon he was quoted as saying \"grass is just for cows\"; he thought that tennis should be played on artificial surfaces as opposed to lawn tennis courts, like the ones at Wimbledon. This statement has been echoed throughout the years by numerous players including Ivan Lendl, Marat Safin, Marcelo Ríos, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, and, despite his 1973 victory at Wimbledon, Jan Kodeš.\n\nSantana was born in Madrid, and began his career as a ball boy and \"picked up\" the game. In 1965, Santana led Spain to unexpected victory over the US in the Davis Cup, and he became a national hero. Despite his previous Grand Slam successes in the French Championships (1961, 1964) and the U.S. Championships (1965), Santana's win at the 1966 Wimbledon lawn tennis championships was a surprise, where he defeated the sixth seed Dennis Ralston 6–4, 11–9, 6–4. This was his last Grand Slam title. His last big tournament win was in 1970 by winning Barcelona where he defeated Rod Laver 6–4, 6–3, 6–4. He also captured the doubles title in Barcelona that year when he teamed with Lew Hoad to defeat Laver/Andrés Gimeno 6–4 9–7 7–5. He was named to the Hall of Fame in 1984.\n\nAt the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, Santana won the gold medal in singles, though tennis was only a demonstration sport at that time. It became a medal sport in 1988 (after another demonstration event in 1984).\n\nHe later was captain of the Spanish Davis cup team twice, once in the '80s and again for four and a half years in the mid-'90s, until he was dismissed in 1999. Until 2019, he was the organizer of the Madrid Masters.\n\nHe manages the Manolo Santana Racquets Club, a tennis club in Marbella, and the Sport Center Manolo Santana, in Madrid.\n\nSantana and Lleyton Hewitt are the only Wimbledon men's singles champions to lose in the first round in the following year; Hewitt's loss was during the Open era, while Santana's was before the Open era.\n\nHe appeared at the 2011 Wimbledon Championships in London in the Royal Box to watch the men's final which was between his fellow countryman Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic (who had just become world No. 1 after winning his semifinal match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga).\n\nManolo Santana was married to María Fernanda González-Dopeso, they had four children (Manuel, Beatriz, Borja, & Bárbara), their marriage ended in 1980.

{"id": "2145706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145706", "title": "Impossible Remixes", "text": "Impossible Remixes\n\nImpossible Remixes is the fifth remix album by Australian singer and songwriter Kylie Minogue. It was released on 8 July 1998 by Mushroom Records. The album was materialized while on her Intimate and Live Tour (1998) and contains remixes from her sixth studio album \"Impossible Princess\" (1997). Originally scheduled for a 1999 release, Mushroom released \"Impossible Remixes\" in Australia in July 1998 after releasing the UK counterpart \"Mixes\" (1998) earlier than its original date.\n\nThe cover sleeve for the album was shot by British photographer Simon Emmett; Minogue had personally commended the cover sleeve for showing \"a lot of heart\". \"Impossible Remixes\" received negative reviews from music critics, who viewed the release as tedious and the material as repetitive. \"Impossible Remixes\" is Minogue's highest charting remix album in her native country, reaching 37 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart.\n\n\"Impossible Remixes\" is Kylie Minogue's fifth remix album. In November 1997, Minogue released her sixth studio album \"Impossible Princess\". Then in January 1998, Minogue begun rehearsals on the low-budget tour Intimate and Live. Minogue intended to only perform in Australia, but strong public demand in the United Kingdom prompt Minogue to tour there too. With tickets selling out instantly, more shows were announced in both Australia and the UK. Minogue started the tour in early June 1998 and confirmed that she would release \"Cowboy Style\", the fourth single from the \"Impossible Princess\" album, and revealed plans of two remix albums, one for Australia and one for the UK.\n\nIn July 1998, Deconstruction and Mushroom confirmed the release of two remix albums entitled \"Mixes\" and \"Impossible Remixes\" respectively. Deconstruction said the \"Mixes\" album would be released as a triple-vinyl set and set the release date for the following year. However, fans voiced their concerns on expensive import prices for global shipping and with increasingly popular demand, Deconstruction scrapped the idea and released the remixes on a two-set compact disc, and forward the triple vinyl at a later date. This allowed Deconstruction to release the album earlier and \"Mixes\" was released on August 3, 1998 in the UK. Mushroom released \"Impossible Remixes\" on 8 July 1998, but initial pressings were on sale two months earlier.\n\nThe album shares majority of the tracks from \"Mixes\" and features remixes of three singles; four remixes of \"Breathe\", two remixes of \"Did It Again\" and one remix of \"Some Kind of Bliss\", along with three remixes of Minogue's promotional single \"Too Far\". The remixes had all been previously featured in Minogue's CD singles. \"Impossible Remixes\" features one remix that did not appear on \"Mixes\", this being the \"Breathe\" TNT Club remix, a club commissioned edit of Tee's Freeze Mix. All tracks were co-written by Minogue, with additional song writing assistance by James Dean Bradfield, Dave Ball, Ingo Vauk, Steve Anderson and David Seaman. In 1997, Minogue traveled to Los Angeles, California to re-record her vocals for the \"Breathe\" remixes.\n\nThe cover sleeve was shot by English photographer Simon Emmett and designed by Andrew Murabito. The cover art of the album, as well as other promotion shoots, show Minogue sitting down and kneeling. After completing the shoot, Emmett was asked by Minogue to shoot the sleeve for her single \"Cowboy Style\", and his most recent work with Minogue was shooting her on \"Glamour\" magazine in July 2012. One of the shoot outtakes appeared on Minogue's photo albums including \"Kylie / Fashion\" and on her 1997 extended play \"Other Sides\".\n\nIn the photo book \"Kylie / Fashion\", Emmett commented on the \"Cowboy Style\" and \"Impossible Remixes\" photo shoot;: \"There are no fashion constraints with Kylie... Her natural poise and dynamism transcended all typical props and accessories. We've made great use here of our easy rapport.\" Minogue commended the photo shoot at the time, saying \"So much of what I was doing at this time had a tiny budget so I brought a lot of pieces, including the pink glitter stick roll, from home [...] It was a great, simple shoot with a lot of heart.\"\n\n\"Impossible Remixes\" received negative reviews from music critics. Jenny Stanley-Clarke, who wrote the biography \"Kylie: Naked\", felt the release \"seemed nothing more than to run out Kylie's contractual obligation for a required third Deconstruction album.\" She favoured the contributions of \"high profiled\" DJ's. Brendan Swift from Allmusic awarded the compilation only one-and-a-half stars out of five, making this Minogue's lowest scoring remix album and overall album on the website. In his review, he argued the material was not new and felt the release tedious and the material was repetitive; he viewed the Razor-n-Go Remix of \"Did it Again\" as an example, despite highlighting it. In his extended review, he explained;\nPint-sized pop diva Kylie Minogue's continued crossover from lightweight pop puppet to respected artist continued with the release of this, a compilation of remixed singles from the \"Impossible Princess\" album. [Impossible Remixes] walks an unrelenting line — with ten versions of four songs (\"Breathe\" clocks in with the highest total at four versions), there's not a lot of room for variation — and the repetition certainly makes for classic club fodder. This is the voice of the new Minogue doing dance as the faded remnants of the Stock, Aitken and Waterman patsy is left well and truly behind — she's now the voice behind the DJs — and there's plenty of their work on this double CD set to sink your teeth into [...] Hardcore Minogue fans with a good pair of dancing shoes may find this gyrating repetition worthwhile; general fans, however, may find the original Impossible Princess more accommodating.\nEarly pressings of \"Impossible Remixes\" helped the album debut at number thirty-seven on the Australian Albums Chart on 26 July 1998, the fourth highest debuting album that week. During its debut week, Minogue's album \"Impossible Princess\" also charted at number nine. This became her highest and only remix album to chart in Australia and her second compilation album to chart. The album slipped to number thirty nine the next week, whereas \"Impossible Princess\" fell to eleven.\n\nAll credits and personnel adapted from \"Impossible Remixes\" liner notes:\n\n\n"}

He was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England. He was the mayor of Scarborough, Ontario from 1978 to 1988.\n\nHe was first elected to Scarborough Township council following World War II, and was elected reeve of the township in 1956. He served on the Board of Control when the township became a borough and then a city in 1983.\n\nAlthough he was a relatively conservative, pro-development mayor, Harris' political roots were in the labour movement, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and the New Democratic Party. He was also progressive on social issues calling for gay rights at a 1979 human rights rally.\n\nHarris never accepted financial donations to his political campaigns from any source so that he would not be captive to any interests. Shortly before the nomination deadlines for the 1988 municipal elections in Ontario, Harris announced he would not seek re-election as mayor, and was officially succeeded by Joyce Trimmer as mayor, in early December 1988.\n\nAlthough retired from active politics, Harris occasionally spoke on various municipal issues in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as transit concerns and the proposal for the potential amalgamation of Metropolitan Toronto. He died at the age of 91 due to complications from Parkinson's disease. A nature trail that passes through Warden Woods Park on Taylor-Massey Creek was named in his honour.\n\nOn 11 December 1973 during a debate on the fate of the community on the Toronto Islands, Harris, a Controller at the time, was firmly against the idea of retaining the houses.

{"id": "2145726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145726", "title": "Ayyavazhi rituals", "text": "Ayyavazhi rituals\n\nAyyavazhi rituals are the religious practices prevalent among the followers of Ayyavazhi. Most of them are connected with Akilam and Arul Nool and a few, though not associated with the holy books, are practiced for over a century right from the beginning of Ayyavazhi. Some practices are unique for Pathis and some others are common for all worship centres.\n\nForms of worship and the features attendant on them can be said to be manifestations and indicators of the type of religiosity present in a religious universe. Apart from Basement of Philosophy and Theology, the various religious practices of Ayyavazhi are also the pillars on which it stands to prove its uniqueness. \n\nFrom the sociological point of view, it also strengthens both physically and mentally the socially downtrodden in a religious way. Several practices evolved in the Ayyavazhi tradition. Religious experience that was existent in Ayyavazhi seems to have expressed itself through certain forms with specific features as said in Akilattirattu Ammanai.\n\nThe practice of vegetarianism is one of the important facts among the followers of Ayyavazhi, seeming to have originated along with Thuvayal Thavasu. Some followers adopted partial vegetarianism. Today, vegetarianism is being strictly practised in one form or another by a section of the followers of Ayyavazhi as one of their religious observances. In particular, most of the Panividaiyalars (one who performs Panividai) of Pathis and Nizhal Thangals strictly follow Vegetarianism.\n\nThe vegetarianism is also activated and highly motivated by the narration of myth in Akilam. Five of the most serious non-vegetarian devils are converted into pure and vegetarian god-heads as Sivayis or \"Garuda\" for serving Vaikundar throughout the incarnation. Arul Nool too teaches one should be vegetarian to a high degree, or otherwise at least partially, especially during the reading of scriptures and during festivals and when practising rituals.\n\nAlso the Thuvayal Thavasu teaches one not only to be vegetarian, but also how to diet or control food-intake.\n\nAkilattirattu mentions a well, situated near the place where Ayya Vaikundar undertook the tavam, and the prevalence of certain ritual practices around it. The well, situated at present at a distance of a furlong to the west of the main pathi (temple) at Swamithoppe, is the historical well.\n\nAkilattirattu speaks of \"the eighteen castes assembling in one place, and bathing from the same well\". This refers to the prevalence of a seemingly innocuous practice of the people, gathered around Ayya Vaikundar, bathing together from the water of this well. People of different castes bathe together at this well, mindless of their social differences. \n\nPhysical closeness was necessitated mainly because of the smallness of the well. Besides bathing, they drank this water as a cure for their illnesses. They cooked their food with this water, and ate the food in a community feast. In the course of events, the well and its water seem to have acquired religious significance to the people of Ayyavazhi. The acts of bathing, drinking a few drops of it, and cooking the food with this water came to be repeated with a ritual fervour. People consider the well a sacred one, and the water as having miraculous powers to heal sicknesses, thousands of people having benefited. A couplet from the Sattu Nittu Olai of Arul Nool reads: \"everyone is drinking the milk of the well around which miracles are growing\". People considered it a religious obligation to bathe and drink at least a few drops of water from this well.\n\nCurrently, one of the important ritual actions performed by the devotees of Ayyavazhi is to take this ritual bath, drawing water from a well dug near every pathi. This has become a necessary ritual before one worships at the pathis. Devotees throng the well to get a few buckets of water onto them and drink a few drops ceremoniously a total of five times before proceeding to the pathi. This practice of bathing at the well is being addressed as patamitutal or muttiripatam.\n\n\"Thiru\" (word representing sacredness) + \"Namam\" (name) represents \"(The Sacred name)\". The people of Ayyavazhi wear a vertical white mark on the forehead in the shape of a flame, starting from the central point between the eyebrows, going straight up near the top edge of the forehead.\n\nThe flame shape represents \"Aanma Jyothi\" or Atman meaning Atman is considered sacred and is the name of God. Zealous devotees smear it on the exterior of the upper arms and over the chest. This white mark was unlike the one worn by a Hindu of Vaishnavism tradition who wore it on the forehead in the shape of a 'U', or of Saivism tradition where it is worn horizontally in three parallel lines. The white powder used for this mark was made from coarse white soil.\n\nAyya Vaikundar seems to have personally touched the forehead of followers and worn it for them. On account of this action, it came to be called thottunamam – meaning 'a mark with a personal touch'. A verse in Ukappatippu of Arulnool says: \"Our Ayya is coming to us by wearing a thottunamam\". This dimension of personal touch stood out to the public eye and was much appreciated by the people of Ayyavazhi.\n\nAt present, those who 'serve' in every Pathi or Nizhal Thangals, wear this white mark for the people and offer a portion of it in their hands. People carry it home as a holy object, and some of them even swallow a little of it believing it to be medicinal.\n\nOne of the significant ritual actions that distinguished the Ayyavazhi male worshipper from others was 'wearing a headgear' during worship. Ayya Vaikundar seems to have enjoined upon his male followers to tie a headgear when they came to worship God. Accordingly, the male followers seem to have tied a headgear during worship. This is to reveal that every person is a king and every one in to rule the Earth. This philosophy is told symbolically by the practice of wearing the headgear since the wearing of headgear is considered as a matter of pride. It was said that this is one of the practices which ties Ayyavazhi close to the Advaita tradition. In addition to the uniqueness of this practice, writings of the historians point to the emergence of this practice as unique to Ayyavazhi.\n\nIt became a ritual action to be performed before the people entered the Pathi to worship. The male devotees usually removed their upper garment and tied the headgear and entered the Pathi for worship. To this day this practice is followed.\n\nAkilam says that Ayya Vaikundar also cured illness in some people with the power he had as the avatar of Narayana. The LMS Report for the year 1843 mentions that Vaikuntacami, \"asserts that one of the principle Hindoo deities has taken up his abode within him,\" and that because of this, \"he is enabled to perform the cure of all diseases, and to confer innumerable blessings on his followers.\" People believing him to be an avatar who could perform cures, seem to have flocked to him and to have been cured by him. In reality, Ayya Vaikundar seems to have initiated a practice of treating the diseases with water and earth. His devotees realised that Ayya was doing these things as a realisation of the dharma that he came to proclaim.\n\nEven today there are a few faithful devotees in Ayyavazhi in their absolute faith in Vaikundar, who do not take any medicine and instead take soil (Thirunamam) and water (Patham) from Pathis and Nizhal Thangals, wearing the Thirunamam on their forehead and drinking the Patham ceremoniously.\n\nPanividai means service. It originally seems to have denoted the service rendered by the disciples to Ayya Vaikundar while he performed the tavam and other activities. It included the activities of serving him with a meal, instructing the people on his behalf, and carrying him to different places wherever he wished to go.\n\nAfter the earthly life of Ayya Vaikundar, panividai had come to mean the service rendered at the sanctuary of Pathis and Nizhal Tangals where Ayya Vaikundar is believed to reside. This service includes cleaning the floor of the sanctuary with water, cleansing and lighting the lamp, offering Churul (betel leaf, arecanut, and bananas), conducting or leading the prayers of incantation like Ucchippatippu or Ukappatippu, wearing Thirunamam and serving food to the devotees. Those who do this service are called panividaiyalar (one who performs panividai). This service may be considered as the counterpart of the puja offered in the temples of Hinduism.\n\nIn the religious gatherings of Ayyavazhi, even as certain forms of worship were in their rudimentary form, one could find the practice of singing songs together which, later on, seems to have been recognised as 'prayer formulas', and recited ritually. \n\nAmong these prayer formulas, Ukappattu, known also as Ukappatippu, which have been formulated during the Thuvayal Thavasu, seems to have occupied a prominent place during the worship. It was recited by a leader and was repeated after him by the people in unison. This prayer formula, for its main part, dwells on the themes of Ayya Vaikundar's divine attributes, his mission to destroy the kali, to establish the Dharma Yukam, and to rule the earth as the undisputed king. Currently, a short form of this prayer is recited every morning and evening at the worship centres of Ayyavazhi or at homes, and the full version of it during special occasions\n\nOther prayer formulas of Uccippatippu – a form of incantationary prayer that speaks about the special attributes of God, recited currently during the noon-worship, Vazhappatippu – are a form of adulatory repetitive prayer that has statements of wishes for the prosperity of the people of Santror Makkal and seem to have developed during the course of the early development of Ayyavazhi. Pothippu, another short formulaic prayer, the content of which invokes God for forgiveness, protection, means of livelihood, attitudes of tolerance and amiability towards one another, and, intelligence, seems to have evolved over the years. It is now recited at the start of every collective worship session. The followers of Ayyavazhi are enjoined to recite this prayer at the break of each day.\n\nAyyavazhi does not have the idea of 'giving offerings' but only 'giving Churul’ This is also one of the significant practices of Ayyavazhi. The gift offered to Ayya Vaikundar was called ‘Churul’, a word that denoted the gift exchanged between consanguinous relatives during marriage functions by way of introducing the kith and kin to the affines. Whoever brought a gift to Ayya Vaikundar gave it to him as if giving to his / her Ayya (father), a curul. It is said in Akilattirattu that towards the end of his mission, Ayya Vaikundar was invited to the houses of his followers and was treated with this Churul.\n\nAt present this act of giving Churul has been ritualised and it is also known as nemital. People bring bananas, coconuts and flowers, in a box made of palm leaves, and hand it over to the one performing Panivitai. The panivitaiyalar receives it and offers it to Ayya and then, after retaining a major portion of it for sharing with others, returns the box with a small portion as Inimam – a gift from Ayya to his children.\n\nThis is yet another unique practice that distinguishes Ayyavazhi from other Hindu religious traditions. The Nizhal Thangals and Pathis have, in their sanctuary, a mirror to reflect the images of those who come to worship. People pay obeisance to their God standing in front of this mirror, facing the Elunetru amidst two oil lamps. Even in the houses of the people of Ayyavazhi, the place earmarked for their daily worship has at least a mirror and a lamp. This is to show the worshippers who go in front of the mirror that, 'God is inside him or herself'.\n\nRegarding the time of origin of this practice, as soon as Ayya attained Vaikundam – a religious euphemism to indicate pass over – people, as per his earlier instruction, installed the mirror over his tomb and began worshipping.\n\nThe Ayyavazhi worship focuses on and revolves around the constant, formless, supreme self which exists inside and as all elements. But this formless self is visible or accessible in one or more different forms or ways with respect to the subjects (viewers); this was symbolised by using the mirror in the Palliyarai, that the image seen in a mirror is nothing but which varies according to the visible object. On the other hand, this mirror installation symbolises the advaidic term that \" 'God is you' \", (i.e.) The mirror is kept facing the worshipper in Palliyarai, and one who sees the sanctum sanctorum only sees himself there.\n\nCongregational worship was a distinctive feature of Ayyavazhi worship. Praying together or \" 'mass prayer' \" was a form of worship Ayya Vaikundar formulated, in distinction to the practice of priests performing Poojas for individual or collective audiences.\n\nCurrently, congregational worship takes place at appointed hours in the worship centres of Ayyavazhi. The devotees worship God, standing close to each other, hands folded over their chests, and a turban \"(Thalai pahai)\" on the heads of the males. They recite together the Ucchippatippu and Ukappatippu, the central prayers. Apart from these, the devotees that come to worship in the Pathi perform certain other rituals also.\n\nInter-dining was an important activity that originated in the gatherings of AV. It has been already noted that people of different castes, coming from far and wide, brought with them food materials for cooking their meals when they came to meet Ayya Vaikundar. They cooked and ate in the presence of Ayya Vaikundar. This commonplace action evolved into a significant practice of inter-dining between persons of different groups, cutting across the boundaries of caste restrictions. This practice, being performed in a religious setting with a certain measure of earnestness and respect, seems to have acquired the character of a ritual too.\n\nThe practice of Anna Dharmam (charity on food) too seems to have emerged in association with inter-dining. With a ritual significance, food was distributed to the needy and to all those gathered around Ayya Vaikundar.\n\nToday, the food being served as Anna Dharmam is known as Unpan Annam, literally meaning 'the food to be eaten', and, it has its own specific method of preparation. Rice, vegetables, and spices are cooked and mixed together for the purpose. Then it is served ceremoniously. When it is served, the partakers wait till everyone is served. Then a question is posed customarily by the partakers: \"Ayya annam kutikkalama ?\" (Ayya, may we eat the meal?) and when it is answered by those who serve as \"Ayya annam kutiyunkal\" (You may kindly eat the meal), the partakers eat the meal. This was to ensure that everyone got the meal. The poor and the rich – all partake of this meal without discrimination. It was considered as a religious virtue to partake of this meal. \nThere is another variant of Anna Dharmam known as Palvaippu, serving of gruel-like food boiled in milk. Currently, every centre of worship of Ayyavazhi has this practice once a month. Anna Dharmam in one form or the other is a daily feature in most of the worship centres of Ayyavazhi.\n\nThe language used in prayers, incantations, and rituals has been Tamil in its simple form. Akilam, while expounding on the glorious features of Dharma Yukam, projects Tamil to be its reigning language. Use of Tamil for worship was striking against the background of the prevalence of the use of Sanskrit in Hindu worship commonly in not only Travancore but in the whole of the Hindu universe during the advent of Ayyavazhi.\n\nIt is noteworthy that some words being used in the Ayyavazhi tradition are strikingly different from those in the Sanskritic tradition. While the words used in the Sanskritic form of worship (in Hinduism) seem to maintain a distance between God and the human being, the Tamil words used in Ayyavazhi forecast a close relation or tie with God and worshippers. This set of words seems to give a distinct identity to Ayyavazhi.\n\nThe Pothippu, in which the worshippers apologise to God for their sin and beg for pardon and redemption is a prayer form written in \"spoken-Tamil\" and is a good example of the usage of common language understood by ordinary people.\n\nShamanism is still in practice in some worship centres. Some believe that through the words of these possessed persons one could be able to know what God tells about him or herself or their activities. As part of shamanic practice, they exhorted the people on various matters, practiced divination (\"Kanakku\") to discern the causes of sickness and misfortunes, and 'foretold future happenings'. The Akilattirattu Ammanai seems to have recognized shamanic acts of worship. A quote in Arul Nool reads, \"For imparting knowledge and making things clear, I kept those who practice divination in the temples.\" \n\nThough shamanism was practised in Ayyavazhi, it was accepted by the scriptures only as an ignorant way of worship (beginning stage in worship) or the initial way to teach a beginner the metaphysics. But on the other hand, shamanic actions in the worship centers of Ayyavazhi are quite often criticised. Commonly it was believed that in 'Ayyavazhi possessions', the possessed person being in the Padmasana posture simply utters or speaks to the audience instead of standing and dancing, as now is the practice. This act of 'standing and dancing' is criticised seriously almost universally by Ayyavazhi followers. \nAlso, Akilam tells of a false deity which was sent to the world by Narayana after Vaikundar attained Vaikundam. It also states that this \"false deity\" used to say, \" \"I am Vaikundar, I was the one who married the deities and unified into myself.\" \" Also this false deity shows many magic practices and also many miracles. Some people used to compare shamanic actions to that of false deity. They cite several quotes from Ayyavazhi scriptures for their criticism. But with a different point of view the supporters of shamanism give different synonymous outputs for the quotes and strengthen their stands. \nThere is also a belief that \"Mudisoodum Perumal\" is a shaman, within whom Vaikundar was a divine power. Though this was commonly not accepted, some theologians refer to some quotes in Akilam and Arul Nool to support their claim.\n\nDiscover ayya vaikundar temples across the world\n\n"}

He co-wrote and directed the psychological thriller film \"Joker\" (2019), which premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival where it received the Golden Lion. \"Joker\" went on to earn him Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, alongside his co writer Scott Silver. Phillip's began his career directing predominantly comedy films which include \"Old School\" (2003), \"Starsky & Hutch\" (2004) and \"The Hangover Trilogy\" (2009, 2011, and 2013). He also wrote the satirical comedy film \"Borat\" (2006) which was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay award.\n\nPhillips was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to a family of Jewish background. He was raised in Huntington, New York, on Long Island. He attended New York University Film School, but dropped out because he could not afford to complete his first film and pay tuition simultaneously. Around that time, he worked at Kim's Video and Music.\n\nPhillips appeared as one of the drivers in the first season of the HBO hidden camera docu-series \"Taxicab Confessions\". In a \"New York Times\" profile, Phillips said he had gotten in trouble for shoplifting as a young man.\n\nPhillip's first documentary film, \"\", centered on the life and death of controversial punk rocker GG Allin, while as a junior at NYU and it went on to become one of the highest grossing student films at the time, even getting a limited theatrical release. Next, he co-directed with then-partner Andrew Gurland for \"Frat House\", a second documentary about college fraternities; it premiered at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and won the Grand Jury Prize for documentary features. It was produced by HBO, but never aired on its channel because many of the film's participants claimed they were paid to re-enact their activities. It was never proven either way.\n\nHis third documentary \"Bittersweet Motel\" centered on the jam band Phish, covering its summer and fall 1997 tours, plus footage from their 1998 spring tour of Europe. It ends at The Great Went, a two-day festival held in upstate Maine which attracted 70,000 people. While at Sundance with \"Frat House\", Phillips met director-producer Ivan Reitman who led Phillips into writing and directing his comedy films, \"Road Trip\" and \"Old School\", for Reitman's Montecito Picture Company.\n\nPhillips also wrote and directed the 2004 film \"Starsky & Hutch\" starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, as well as the 2006 film \"School for Scoundrels\", starring Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder. In 2005, \"Details Magazine\" cited Judd Apatow, Adam McKay and Phillips as \"The Frat Pack\". He worked on the satirical comedy \"\" (2006), but he resigned his position as a director in early 2005, due to creative differences. Nevertheless, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his role in fashioning the story.\n\nAfter establishing Green Hat Films in 2008, Phillips directed and produced \"The Hangover\", that was made for a reported $35 million and went on to become the highest-grossing R-rated comedy in 2009. Its worldwide gross stood at $480 million on February 3, 2012. The film went on to win the Golden Globe for Best Picture (Musical or Comedy). It also won Best Comedy at the 2009 Broadcast Film Critics Awards. Phillips took almost no up-front salary in exchange for a large share of the film's profits, and has said that the movie's enormous success, combined with his deal, makes it \"my \"Star Wars\"\". After a worldwide gross of $467 million, his share in the film made Phillips around $50 million.\n\nIn 2010, Phillips directed, produced and co-wrote the comedy \"Due Date\", which starred Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. It was a box office success, grossing $211,780,324 worldwide.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, production on \"The Hangover Part II\" began in Bangkok, Thailand that Phillips directed, produced and co-wrote. The film shot for 63 days and broke various records upon its release on May 26, 2011. With the film debuting at midnight with showings in 2,600 theaters, the film earned $10.4 million, breaking the record for the biggest midnight opening for an R-rated film. \"The Hangover Part II\" went on to accrue a launch day total of $31.6 million; nearly doubling \"The Hangover\"s Friday launch opening ($16.7 million). This amount broke two further records; the highest-grossing opening day for a live-action comedy and the highest-grossing opening day for an R-rated comedy film, replacing \"Sex and the City\" ($26.7 million). The three-day opening weekend accumulated $85,946,294 – an average of $23,923 per theater – becoming the highest grossing opening weekend for a comedy film, replacing \"The Simpsons Movie\" ($74 million). For the Memorial Day four-day weekend, the film amassed $103.4 million to become the fourth-highest-grossing Memorial Day weekend opening. Finally, the film's worldwide gross of $581,464,305 beat the previous R-rated comedy record holder \"The Hangover\" to become the third-biggest R-rated comedy film of all time.\n\nHe returned to direct, write, and produce \"The Hangover Part III\", which was released in 2013. It grossed over $300 million, pushing \"The Hangover Trilogy\"s total box office gross to $1.4 billion.\n\nIn 2016, following the successes of \"The Hangover\" trilogy, Phillips directed, produced, and co-wrote the crime film \"War Dogs\", starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller.\n\nPhillips directed, co-wrote, and co-produced an origin story film of DC Comics's supervillain, the Joker. The script, set in 1981, was co-written by Scott Silver, and the film starred Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. The film premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival and was released in October 2019.\n\nPhillips is scheduled to direct a biographical film about Hulk Hogan, starring Chris Hemsworth in the lead role. Frequent collaborator Scott Silver is a co-writer, alongside John Pollono. Philips is producing the film with Bradley Cooper, one of the lead actors of Phillips' \"The Hangover\" trilogy and producer on \"Joker\".\n\nWhen asked in a 2014 interview by the BBC if he believes in God, Phillips replied: \"Personally I don't. But I believe there's a higher power, a collective energy in people that you might say is God\". Phillips said in 2019, in the aftermath of his dark drama \"Joker\" release, that he had stopped making comedy films because of the backlash of \"woke culture\", saying: \"Go try to be funny nowadays... There were articles written about why comedies don't work anymore— I'll tell you why, because all the fucking funny guys are like, 'Fuck this shit, because I don't want to offend you.' It's hard to argue with 30 million people on Twitter.\"\n"}

In honour of Eudoxia, the wife of the emperor Arcadius, its name was changed to Eudoxiupolis or Eudoxioupolis (Εὐδοξιούπολις), which it bore for a considerable time; but the modern name of its site, Silivri, shows that it subsequently resumed its original designation.\n\nRespecting the history of Selymbria, only detached and fragmentary notices occur in the Greek writers. In Latin authors, it is merely named; although Pliny the Elder reports that it was said to have been the birthplace of Prodicus, a disciple of Hippocrates. It was here that Xenophon met Medosades, the envoy of Seuthes II, whose forces afterwards encamped in its neighbourhood. When Alcibiades was commanding for the Athenians in the Propontis (410 BCE), the people of Selymbria refused to admit his army into the town, but gave him money, probably in order to induce him to abstain from forcing an entrance. Some time after this, however, he gained possession of the place through the treachery of some of the townspeople, and, having levied a contribution upon its inhabitants, left a garrison in it. Selymbria is mentioned by Demosthenes in 351 BCE, as in alliance with the Athenians; and it was no doubt at that time a member of the Byzantine confederacy. According to a letter of Philip II of Macedon, quoted in the oration \"de Corona\", it was blockaded by him about 343 BCE; but others consider that this mention of Selymbria is one of the numerous proofs that the documents inserted in that speech are not authentic.\n\nIn Christian times, Selymbria was the seat of an archbishop; no longer a residential see, it remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIts site is located at Silivri in European Turkey.\n"}
{"id": "2145784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145784", "title": "Nahom", "text": "Nahom\n\nNahom () is a place referenced in the Book of Mormon () as one of the stops on the Old World segment of Lehi's journey. This location is referred to as the place where Ishmael is laid to rest. It was also at this location that the path of Lehi's journey changed from a southern to an eastern direction before continuing toward the coast and the land () Bountiful. (\"See Archaeology and the Book of Mormon.\")\n\nSome LDS archaeologists believe that they have located the site of Nahom as a settlement and tribal area known anciently and still today as \"NHM\" (see below). Critics doubt the link between Nahom and NHM, as well as having other criticisms.\n\nIn , Lehi receives the Liahona and his group departs from the Valley of Lemuel. After traveling for four days in \"nearly a south-southeast direction\" they make camp in a place they name \"Shazer.\" They continue to travel in the \"same direction\" for \"many days\" with the Liahona as a guide (). Verses 34 and 35 read:\n\nIn the next four verses, the dissenters plot to kill Lehi and Nephi, but the threat is not carried out. The next verse reports that Lehi's group has resumed their journey and changed the direction of their travel \"eastward\" ().\n\nLDS scholars have proposed a specific location for Nahom based on archaeological evidences, which overrides previous speculation. Others give a linguistical reason for which the proposed location does not match the Nahom descriptions given in the \"Book of Mormon\".\n\nSome scholars believe that Lehi's group followed the ancient frankincense trails in the northern part of Yemen at times during the initial leg of their journey . The location of NHM is near the main junction of these ancient trails at a point where the trails veer to the east.\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, prior to their arrival at Nahom, the travelers had been moving in a \"south-southeast\" direction (). It was at this location \"Nahom\" that the Book of Mormon states that the travelers made a significant change in direction \"eastward\" before continuing their journey toward the coast. The location of NHM and the eastward change in direction have been used by LDS scholars to assist in determining a plausible location for the coastal location referred to by Nephi as Bountiful.\n\nIn 1976, it was originally speculated by Lynn M. Hilton that Nahom might correlate with the location of the village of Al Qunfudhah, Tanomah, in Saudi Arabia . In 1978 Ross T. Christensen noted the existence of a location in Yemen called \"Nehhm\" on an early map produced by Carsten Niebuhr as the result of a scientific expedition sent out by King Frederick V of Denmark . After doing extensive research over several years at the site in Yemen, the location of Nahom was associated with the existing location and tribal name NHM (usually vocalized as NIHM or NEHEM or NAHM) by Warren and Michaela Aston in 1994 . LDS scholars now consider the location and tribal area of NHM in the Jawf Valley in Yemen to be the only plausible location for the place referred to as Nahom in the Book of Mormon.\n\nLDS scholars consider NHM to be one of the locations in the Arabian peninsula that they believe confirms Book of Mormon historicity in the Old World . Terryl Givens states that the discovery of the altars \"may thus be said to constitute the first actual archaeological evidence for the historicity of the Book of Mormon.\" This conclusion is based upon archaeological evidence and inscriptions recently found on altars at a specific location in Yemen which appear to correlate with the \"place called Nahom\" described in the book of 1 Nephi . Nahom is one of only a very few locations mentioned in the Book of Mormon that the text implies had been named prior to contact with the Lehite travelers, in contrast to Lehi's normal application of the Middle Eastern practice of naming locations after family members .\n\nAlthough the actual location of NHM is plausible when compared to Lehi's purported route, his change of direction on the Arabian peninsula, the timeframe (~600 BC) matching the archaeological dates, and the ancient burial ground found there, one non-LDS author has suggested a valid reason why Nahom and NHM may not represent the same location: the pronunciation of NHM is unknown .\n\nThe Bar'an temple in Marib ( east of San'a in Yemen) was excavated by a German archaeological team led by Burkhard Vogt. Before excavation began, all that was visible at the Bar'an site were six columns projecting above the sand. The temple structure and many of the altars were found to be well preserved by the sand and desert climate . One of the artifacts discovered at this location was an inscribed altar which has been dated to the seventh or sixth centuries BC. According to the inscription, the altar was donated to the temple by \"Bi'athtar, son of Sawad, son of Naw'an, the Nihmite\" . The first altar discovered was removed from the Bar'an site and placed in a traveling exhibit which began touring Europe in October 1997. Since that time, two additional altars bearing the same inscription mentioning \"NHM\" have been identified at the same temple site .\n\nEach of the altars is constructed of solid limestone. All three contain a dedication inscription, which is carved around all four sides of the altars in the South Arabian script of that period, and each bears the name of their donor: Bi'athar . The first altar was dated to between the seventh and sixth centuries B.C by French researcher Christian Robin . Since Naw'um of the tribe of Nihm was the grandfather of Bi'athar, it is estimated that the Nihm tribal name must be at least two generations older than the altars themselves .\n\nVowels in Hebrew are spoken but not written. Therefore, roots in Semitic languages such as Hebrew or Arabic utilize only the consonants and not the vowels . Some of the variant names based upon the Semitic root NHM found in both Arabic and Hebrew texts are \"Nahum\", \"Naham\", \"Nihm\", \"Nehem\" and \"Nahm\" . The root NHM has different meanings. The South Arabian root NHM is related to stone cutting. The Hebrew root NHM is found repeatedly in the Bible and relates to sorrow, hunger, consoling, and mourning . Scholars consider this root appropriate when used to refer to a place of burial and the expression of mourning . This theory is corroborated by a huge area of ancient burial tombs at 'Alam, Ruwayk, and Jidran about north of Marib that were examined by a French team at approximately the same time that the Bar'an excavation was completed. This burial complex is the largest such burial area known anywhere in Arabia .\n\nThe name NHM denotes both a tribal region and a location in the southern part of Arabia . In 1763 a German surveyor and mapmaker named Carsten Niebuhr produced a map which contained the place name \"Nehhm\" at a location approximately twenty-five miles northeast of the Yemen capital Sana'a . In 1792 Robert Heron published a two-volume translation of Niebuhr's first work titled \"Niebuhr's Travels through Arabia and Other Countries in the East\" . Niebuhr explained in his book: \"I have had no small difficulty in writing down these names; both from the diversity of dialects in the country, and from the indistinct pronunciation of those from whom I was obliged to ask them.\" Niebuhr circles the boundaries of this area of Nehhm on the map; it covers an area of approximately . There is no evidence, however, that Joseph Smith had access to these materials before the publication of the Book of Mormon. Likewise, there is also no evidence that he or one of his acquaintances did not have access to these sources. .\n\nIn the Book of Mormon, Nahom is one of the few locations mentioned in the Book of Mormon that was not named by Lehi, thus suggesting that this was a pre-existing place name. The Book of Mormon states that Ishmael, the patriarch of the family that left with Lehi's, was buried \"in the place which was called Nahom.\" It was also at Nahom that the travelers made a significant change in the direction of their travel from \"south-southeast\" to \"nearly eastward.\" \n\nKnown criticisms include the following :\n\n \n\nIt has been said that the link between Nahom and Nehhm, as spelled in Niebuhr's work, is invalid because the vowels between the names \"Nahom\" and \"Nehhm\" do not match, stating that \"only three of the five letters in Nehhm agree with the spelling Nahom. The second letter in Nehhm is e rather than a, and the fourth letter is h instead of o. The variant spellings of Nehem, Nehm, Nihm, Nahm and Naham, do not really help to solve the problem.\" Some indicate that modern vowel variance is to be expected because Hebrew does not have written vowels. The current pronunciation of the location and tribal area is said to be \"Nihm\" or \"Nehem\" or \"Nahm\" rather than \"Nahom\". One critic states that the time from Ishmael's death to now (~2600 years) is not long enough to account for the change in pronunciation, although scholars indicate that historical variation in root pronunciation (possibly due to Arabic influence) may allow for this change.\n\nLDS apologists argue that the NHM does indeed date to Lehi's time. The inscriptions on \"small votive altars given to the Bar'an Temple near Marib by a certain Bicathar of the tribe of Nihm\" date to \"seventh and sixth centuries BC\". Lehi's family is believed to have left Jerusalem in the sixth century.\n\n"}

She has been the Member for Lismore in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly since 23 March 2019. She was the Member for Page in the Australian House of Representatives from 2007 to 2013, and a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1995 to 2003.\n\nSaffin was born into a working-class family in Ipswich in Queensland. She left school at thirteen, and worked in a range of unskilled jobs before gaining her Intermediate Certificate at TAFE. She moved to Lismore at the age of 24, and began working as the co-ordinator of a women's refuge. She also established a domestic violence liaison committee with the local police, which was the first of its kind outside Sydney. She later gained a teaching qualification at the Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education, and taught for a period before deciding to retrain as a lawyer and gaining a degree by correspondence from Macquarie University.\n\nShe ran as the Labor candidate for the seat of Lismore at the 1991 state election, but was defeated by incumbent National Party MP Bill Rixon. Four years later, she contested and won preselection for the eighth and last winnable position on the Labor ticket for the Legislative Council at the 1995 state election. Labor's victory at the election thus saw her comfortably elected, albeit on preferences, on election day.\n\nSaffin was associated with the Socialist Left faction of the party throughout her term, and was involved in advocating for progressive causes both inside and outside of parliament. She took a particular interest in the fate of East Timor and Burma, and was an official observer for the International Commission of Jurists at the 1999 independence referendum in East Timor. She was actively involved in feminist causes, and was one of only two Australian representatives at the Global Forum of Women Political Leaders in Manila in 2000. She also worked as an anti-nuclear campaigner, being involved in the campaigns against French nuclear testing in the Pacific and uranium mining at Jabiluka. She attempted to gain Labor preselection for a second term before the 2003 state election, but missed out on one of her faction's three winnable positions, forcing her out of politics.\n\nSaffin had met East Timorese foreign minister José Ramos-Horta a number of times as an MP, and in 2004, having left politics, she moved to East Timor to take up a position as Ramos-Horta's chief political and legal advisor. She served in the role for three years assisting in the rebuilding of the country, staying with Ramos-Horta through his election first to Prime Minister and then President in 2007. She resigned in early 2007, choosing to return to Australia for \"family reasons\" and contest preselection for the National Party held federal seat of Page, based around her home town of Lismore. She faced a difficult preselection contest against right faction candidate and local mayor Ian Tiley, but emerged successful.\n\nSaffin then faced a difficult contest in the general election against new National Party candidate Chris Gulaptis, with previous member Ian Causley having decided to retire at the election. Causley had held the seat with a 5.5% margin, which saw the possibility of victory initially considered unlikely. However, as Labor continued to poll well in the seat, they began to supply more resources to the campaign, with the party's assistant secretary declaring Page to be a \"target seat\" in September. She campaigned heavily on industrial relations, health and housing affordability, and received a 2PP swing of 7.8%, beating the Nationals candidate on Greens preferences. This resulted in Page being one of the first seats nationally to be declared on election night.\n\nOn 21 March 2013 she resigned as Government Whip after an attempt to replace Prime Minister Julia Gillard with the previous Prime Minister Kevin Rudd failed. The attempt foundered when Rudd unexpectedly announced that he would not contest the position. Saffin had indicated support for Rudd.\n\nSaffin was defeated at the 2013 election against Nationals candidate Kevin Hogan. She defeated him at the 2010 election, improving her vote. However she then suffered a 7.2% swing against her in 2013.\n\nAt a TAFE rally on 23 September 2015, with Labor's Shadow Minister for Vocational Education, Sharon Bird, Janelle Saffin announced that she would again contest the federal seat of Page at the 2016 election. She was subsequently defeated by Kevin Hogan.\n\nOn 22 April 2018 Saffin won preselection to contest the NSW State seat of Lismore, which she won on 23 March 2019.\n\n"}

After their split with producer Brian Eno and a short hiatus, which allowed the individual members to pursue side projects, recording began in 1982. It became the band's commercial breakthrough and produced the band's sole US top-ten hit, \"Burning Down the House\".\n\nThe album's tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's 1984 film \"Stop Making Sense\", which generated a live album of the same name. The album also crossed over to the dance charts, where it peaked at number two for six weeks. It is the group's highest-charting album on the US \"Billboard\" 200. It was also their biggest-selling album in Canada, where it was certified platinum in 1983.\n\nDavid Byrne designed the cover for the general release of the album. Artist Robert Rauschenberg won a Grammy Award for his work on the limited-edition LP version. This album featured a clear vinyl disc in clear plastic packaging along with three clear plastic discs printed with similar collages in three different colors.\n\nOriginal cassette and later CD copies of the album have \"extended versions\" of \"Making Flippy Floppy\", \"Girlfriend Is Better\", \"Slippery People\", \"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\" and \"Moon Rocks\". The album was re-released in February 2006 as a remastered DualDisc. It contains the extended versions of the songs found on the original cassette, and includes two additional tracks (\"Two Note Swivel\" and an alternate mix of \"Burning Down the House\"). The DVD-A side includes both stereo and 5.1 surround high resolution (96 kHz/24bit) mixes, as well as a Dolby Digital 5.1 version of the album, a new alternate version of \"Burning Down the House\" with the emphasis on experimenting with the possibilities of surround sound, and videos for \"Burning Down the House\" and \"This Must Be the Place\" (videos are two-channel Dolby Digital only). In Europe it was released as a CD+DVDA two-disc set rather than a single DualDisc. The reissue was produced by Andy Zax with Talking Heads.\n\nByrne has said, as a partial explanation of the album's title, \"I originally sang nonsense, and uh, made words to fit that. That worked out all right.\"\n\n\"Rolling Stone\"s David Fricke lauded the album's crossover nature, calling it \"the album that finally obliterates the thin line separating arty white pop music and deep black funk.\" He elaborated that the songs are all true art rock, with the complexity and sophistication of the genre, yet avoid art rock's characteristic pretensions with a laid-back attitude and compelling dance rhythms, making it an ideal party album.\n\nIn 1989 the album was ranked number 54 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the \"100 best albums of the 1980s\". In 2012 \"Slant Magazine\" listed the album at number 89 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\".\n\nReviewing the album for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann said: \"Talking Heads found a way to open up the dense textures of the music they had developed with Brian Eno on their two previous studio albums for \"Speaking in Tongues\", and were rewarded with their most popular album yet. Ten backup singers and musicians accompanied the original quartet, but somehow the sound was more spacious, and the music admitted aspects of gospel, notably in the call-and-response of \"Slippery People,\" and John Lee Hooker-style blues, on \"Swamp.\" As usual, David Byrne determinedly sang and chanted impressionistic, nonlinear lyrics, sometimes by mix-and-matching clichés... Some of his charming goofiness had returned since the overly serious \"Remain in Light\" and \"Fear of Music\", and the accompanying music, filled with odd percussive and synthesizer sounds, could be unusually light and bouncy. In his book on funk music, Rickey Vincent describes \"Speaking in Tongues\" as \"deeply thumping funk disguised as modern rock.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Although Italy had hoped to gain the territories with a surprise offensive, the front soon bogged down into trench warfare, similar to the Western Front fought in France, but at high altitudes and with very cold winters. Fighting along the front displaced much of the civilian population, of which several thousand died from malnutrition and illness in Italian and Austrian refugee camps. The Allied victory at Vittorio Veneto, the disintegration of Austria-Hungary and the Italian capture of Trento, Bolzano and Trieste ended the military operations. Italy also refers to the Great War as the Fourth War of Independence, which completed the last stage of the Italian unification.\n\nWhile being a member of the Triple Alliance which consisted of Italy, Austria-Hungary and Germany, Italy did not declare war in August 1914, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive in nature and therefore Austria-Hungary's aggression did not obligate Italy to take part. Moreover, Austria-Hungary omitted to consult Italy before sending the ultimatum to Serbia and refused to discuss compensation due according to article 7 of the Alliance. Italy had a longstanding rivalry with Austria-Hungary, dating back to the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, which granted several regions on the Italian peninsula to the Austrian Empire.\n\nMore importantly, a radical nationalist political movement, called Unredeemed Italy (\"Italia irredenta\"), founded in the 1880s, started claiming the Italian-inhabited territories of Austria-Hungary, especially in the Austrian Littoral and in the County of Tyrol. By the 1910s, the expansionist ideas of this movement were taken up by a significant part of the Italian political elite. The annexation of those Austrian territories that were inhabited by Italians became the main Italian war goal, assuming a similar function to the issue of Alsace-Lorraine for the French. However, of around 1.5 million people living in those areas, 45% were Italian speakers, while the rest were Slovenes, Germans and Croats. In northern Dalmatia, which was also among the Italian war aims, the Italian-speaking population was only around 5%.\n\nIn the early stages of the war, Allied diplomats secretly courted Italy, attempting to secure Italian participation on the Allied side. Set up between the British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey, the Italian Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino and the French Foreign Minister Jules Cambon, Italy's entry was finally engineered by the Treaty of London of 26 April 1915, in which Italy renounced her obligations to the Triple Alliance.\n\nOn 23 May, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary.\n\nDuring the Italo-Turkish War in Libya (1911–1912), the Italian military suffered equipment and munition shortages not yet repaired before Italian entry into the Great War. At the opening of the campaign, Austro-Hungarian troops occupied and fortified high ground of the Julian Alps and Karst Plateau, but the Italians initially outnumbered their opponents three-to-one.\n\nAn Italian offensive aimed to cross the Soča (Isonzo) river, take the fortress town of Gorizia, and then enter the Karst Plateau. This offensive opened the first Battles of the Isonzo.\n\nAt the beginning of the First Battle of the Isonzo on 23 June 1915, Italian forces outnumbered the Austrians three-to-one but failed to penetrate the strong Austro-Hungarian defensive lines in the highlands of northwestern Gorizia and Gradisca. Because the Austrian forces occupied higher ground, Italians conducted difficult offensives while climbing. The Italian forces therefore failed to drive much beyond the river, and the battle ended on 7 July 1915.\n\nDespite a professional officer corps, severely under-equipped Italian units lacked morale. Also many troops deeply disliked the newly appointed Italian commander, general Luigi Cadorna. Moreover, preexisting equipment and munition shortages slowed progress and frustrated all expectations for a \"Napoleonic style\" breakout. Like most contemporaneous militaries, the Italian army primarily used horses for transport but struggled and sometimes failed to supply the troops sufficiently in the tough terrain.\n\nTwo weeks later on 18 July 1915, the Italians attempted another frontal assault against the Austro-Hungarian trench lines with more artillery in Second Battle of the Isonzo. In the northern section of the front, the Italians managed to overrun Mount Batognica over Kobarid (Caporetto), which would have an important strategic value in future battles. This bloody offensive concluded in stalemate when both sides ran out of ammunition.\n\nThe Italians recuperated, rearmed with 1200 heavy guns, and then on 18 October 1915 launched Third Battle of the Isonzo, another attack. Forces of Austria-Hungary repulsed this Italian offensive, which concluded on 4 November without resulting gains.\n\nThe Italians again launched another offensive on 10 November, the Fourth Battle of the Isonzo. Both sides suffered more casualties, but the Italians conquered important entrenchments, and the battle ended on 2 December for exhaustion of armaments, but occasional skirmishing persisted.\n\nAfter the winter lull, the Italians launched the Fifth Battle of the Isonzo on 9 March 1916, and captured the strategic Mount Sabatino. But Austria-Hungary repulsed all other attacks, and the battle concluded on 16 March in poor weather for trench warfare.\n\nFollowing Italy's stalemate, the Austrian forces began planning a counteroffensive (Battle of Asiago) in Trentino and directed over the plateau of Altopiano di Asiago, with the aim to break through to the Po River plain and thus cutting off the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Italian Armies in the North East of the country. The offensive began on 15 May 1916 with 15 divisions, and resulted in initial gains, but then the Italians counterattacked and pushed the Austro-Hungarians back to the Tyrol.\n\nLater in 1916, four more battles along the Isonzo river erupted. The Sixth Battle of the Isonzo, launched by the Italians in August, resulted in a success greater than the previous attacks. The offensive gained nothing of strategic value but did take Gorizia, which boosted Italian spirits. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth battles of the Isonzo (14 September – 4 November) managed to accomplish little except to wear down the already exhausted armies of both nations.\n\nThe frequency of offensives for which the Italian soldiers partook between May 1915 and August 1917, one every three months, was higher than demanded by the armies on the Western Front. Italian discipline was also harsher, with punishments for infractions of duty of a severity not known in the German, French, and British armies.\n\nShellfire in the rocky terrain caused 70% more casualties per rounds expended than on the soft ground in Belgium and France. By the autumn of 1917 the Italian army had suffered most of the deaths it was to incur during the war, yet the end of the war seemed to still be an eternity away. This was not the same line of thought for the Austrians. On 25 August, the Emperor Charles wrote to the Kaiser the following: \"\"The experience we have acquired in the eleventh battle has led me to believe that we should fare far worse in the twelfth. My commanders and brave troops have decided that such an unfortunate situation might be anticipated by an offensive. We have not the necessary means as regards troops.\"\"\n\nFrom 1915, the high peaks of the Dolomites range were an area of fierce mountain warfare. In order to protect their soldiers from enemy fire and the hostile alpine environment, both Austro-Hungarian and Italian military engineers constructed fighting tunnels which offered a degree of cover and allowed better logistics support. Working at high altitudes in the hard carbonate rock of the Dolomites, often in exposed areas near mountain peaks and even in glacial ice, required extreme skill of both Austro-Hungarian and Italian miners.\n\nBeginning on the 13th, later referred to as White Friday, December 1916 would see 10,000 soldiers on both sides killed by avalanches in the Dolomites. Numerous avalanches were caused by the Italians and Austro-Hungarians purposefully firing artillery shells on the mountainside, while others were naturally caused.\n\nIn addition to building underground shelters and covered supply routes for their soldiers like the Italian \"Strada delle 52 Gallerie\", both sides also attempted to break the stalemate of trench warfare by tunneling under no man's land and placing explosive charges beneath the enemy's positions. Between 1 January 1916 and 13 March 1918, Austro-Hungarian and Italian units fired a total of 34 mines in this theatre of the war. Focal points of the underground fighting were Pasubio with 10 mines, Lagazuoi with 5, Col di Lana/Monte Sief also with 5, and Marmolada with 4 mines. The explosive charges ranged from to of blasting gelatin. In April 1916, the Italians detonated explosives under the peaks of Col Di Lana, killing numerous Austro-Hungarians.\n\nThe Italians directed a two-pronged attack against the Austrian lines north and east of Gorizia. The Austrians checked the advance east, but Italian forces under Luigi Capello managed to break the Austrian lines and capture the Banjšice Plateau. Characteristic of nearly every other theater of the war, the Italians found themselves on the verge of victory but could not secure it because their supply lines could not keep up with the front-line troops and they were forced to withdraw. However, the Italians had nearly destroyed the Austro-Hungarian army on the front, forcing them to call in German help for the much anticipated Caporetto Offensive.\n\nThe Austrians received desperately needed reinforcements after the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo from German Army soldiers rushed in after the Russian offensive ordered by Kerensky of July 1917 failed. The Germans introduced infiltration tactics to the Austrian front and helped work on a new offensive. Meanwhile, mutinies and plummeting morale crippled the Italian Army from within. The soldiers lived in poor conditions and engaged in attack after attack that often yielded minimal or no military gain.\n\nOn 24 October 1917 the Austrians and Germans launched the Battle of Caporetto (Italian name for Kobarid). Chlorine-arsenic agent and diphosgene gas shells were fired as part of a huge artillery barrage, followed by infantry using infiltration tactics, bypassing enemy strong points and attacking on the Italian rear. At the end of the first day, the Italians had retreated to the Tagliamento River.\n\nWhen the Austrian offensive routed the Italians, the new Italian chief of staff, Armando Diaz ordered to stop their retreat and defend the fortified defenses around the Monte Grappa summit between the Roncone and the Tomatico mountains; although numerically inferior (51,000 against 120,000) the Italian Army managed to halt the Austro-Hungarian and German armies in the First Battle of Monte Grappa.\n\nAdvancing deep and fast, the Austrians outran their supply lines, which forced them to stop and regroup. The Italians, pushed back to defensive lines near Venice on the Piave River, had suffered 600,000 casualties to this point in the war. Because of these losses, the Italian Government called to arms the so-called \"99 Boys\" (\"Ragazzi del '99\"); the new class of conscripts born in 1899 who were turning 18 in 1917. In November 1917, British and French troops started to bolster the front line. Far more decisive than Allied troops was Franco-British (and US) help providing strategic materials (steel, coal and crops – provided by the British but imported from Argentina – etc.), which Italy always lacked sorely. In the spring of 1918, Germany pulled out its troops for use in its upcoming Spring Offensive on the Western Front. As a result of the Spring Offensive, Britain and France also pulled half of their divisions back to the Western Front.\n\nThe Austrians now began debating how to finish the war in Italy. The Austro-Hungarian generals disagreed on how to administer the final offensive. Archduke Joseph August of Austria decided for a two-pronged offensive, where it would prove impossible for the two forces to communicate in the mountains.\n\nThe Second Battle of the Piave River began with a diversionary attack near the Tonale Pass named Lawine, which the Italians repulsed after two days of fighting. Austrian deserters betrayed the objectives of the upcoming offensive, which allowed the Italians to move two armies directly in the path of the Austrian prongs. The other prong, led by general Svetozar Boroević von Bojna initially experienced success until aircraft bombed their supply lines and Italian reinforcements arrived.\n\nTo the disappointment of Italy's allies, no counter-offensive followed the Battle of Piave. The Italian Army had suffered huge losses in the battle, and considered an offensive dangerous. General Armando Diaz waited for more reinforcements to arrive from the Western Front. By the end of October 1918, Austro-Hungary was falling apart. Czechoslovakia, Croatia, and Slovenia proclaimed their independence and troops started deserting, disobeying orders and retreating. Many Czechoslovak troops, in fact, started working for the Allied Cause, and in September 1918, five Czechoslovak Regiments were formed in the Italian Army.\n\nBy October 1918, Italy finally had enough soldiers to mount an offensive. The attack targeted Vittorio Veneto, across the Piave. The Italian Army broke through a gap near Sacile and poured in reinforcements that crushed the Austrian defensive line. On 31 October, the whole front began to collapse and the Italian Army launched a full scale attack. On 3 November, 300,000 Austrian soldiers surrendered, at the same day the Italians entered Trento and Trieste, greeted by the population.\n\nOn 3 November, the military leaders of the already disintegrated Austria-Hungary sent a flag of truce to the Italian commander to ask again for an armistice and terms of peace. The terms were arranged by telegraph with the Allied authorities in Paris, communicated to the Austrian commander, and were accepted. The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near Padua, on 3 November, and took effect at three o'clock in the afternoon of 4 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the Habsburg Monarchy and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nItalian military deaths numbered 834 senior officers and generals, 16,872 junior officers, 16,302 non-commissioned officers, and 497,103 enlisted men, for a total of over 531,000 dead. Of these, 257,418 men came from Northern Italy, 117,480 from Central Italy, and 156,251 from Southern Italy.\n\nBy the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact. From 5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached Lissa, Lagosta, Sebenico, and other localities on the Dalmatian coast. In 1918, Admiral Enrico Millo declared himself Italy's Governor of Dalmatia. After 4 November the Italian military occupied also Innsbruck and all Tyrol by 20–22,000 soldiers of the III Corps of the First Army.\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Roberto Brusati\n\nLieutenant General Vittorio Camerana\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Florenzio Aliprindi\n\n\nLieutenant General Pietro Frugoni\n\nLieutenant General Enzio Reisoli\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Mario Nicolis de Robilant\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Luigi Segato\n\n\nsource:\nHis Royal Highness, Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Aosta\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Carlo Ruelle\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Vincenzo Garioni\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Giorgio Cigliana\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Luigi Nava\n\nLieutenant General Ottavio Ragni\n\nLieutenant General Pietro Marini\n\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Clemente Lequio\n\nsource:\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Ottavio Briccola\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Domenico Grandi\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Gaetano Zoppi\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Paolo Morrone\n\nLieutenant General Carlo Guicciardi di Cervarolo\n\nsource:\nLieutenant General Alessandro Malingri di Bagnolo\n\n\n"}

For his \"dramatic impact on the development of the automobile and the automotive industry\" he was inducted posthumously into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan, US.\n\nLee Hunter, Jr., was a 23-year-old St. Louis architecture student, found himself frequently confronted with car battery failure in his Packard convertible automobile. In 1936, it took several days to recharge a car battery. Hunter sought to find a better, faster way to recharge batteries. With the help of a former Washington University electrical engineering professor, Hunter began developing a new design. His quick charge battery recharger was based on a diverter pole generator. He put this new product on the market and during the Great Depression, the \"Lee Hunter, Jr., Manufacturing Co.\" sold the $497 Kwikurent charger as fast as the company could make them.\n\nAfter serving in both the United States Army Corps of Engineers and Ordnance Corps during World War II, Hunter returned to St. Louis in 1946 and reopened his business under the name of Hunter Engineering. Lee Hunter also laid the foundation for a global distribution base for Hunter products. In 1955 Hunter developed a new wheel alignment system called 'Lite-A-Line', which became the industry standard. In 1962, Hunter's 'Tune-Align' became the first mechanical alignment system capable of compensating for wheel run-out, a major factor affecting wheel alignment precision. Hunter Engineering continued to expand its export markets and in 1964 was named by the U.S. Department of Commerce as a winner of the E-Award for excellence in the development of export trade.\n\nNearly 50 years after Lee Hunter founded Hunter Engineering Company, he was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan. In this shrine of automotive history, Lee Hunter shares the spotlight with automotive industry giants like Henry Ford, Louis Chevrolet, Walter P. Chrysler and Soichiro Honda. The Hall of Fame places Hunter among “individuals who have made a dramatic impact on the development of the automobile and the automotive industry”.

The term \"how\" derives from the Old Norse word \"haugr\" meaning a hill and a mound, so Greenhow literally means 'Green's hill or mound'.\n\nIt is situated about west of Pateley Bridge on the road heading towards Grassington, and is mainly in the civil parish of Bewerley. However, the western end of the village lying to the west of Kell Dyke, commonly known as Craven Cross, lies within the civil parish of Appletreewick in Craven. It is one of the highest villages in Yorkshire, at an altitude of between , and one of the few villages in the United Kingdom lying at over .\n\nGreenhow is an old mining village that was a major supplier of lead. Sir Stephen Proctor bought the Manor of Bewerley, including the mineral rights in 1597. He was also responsible, as part of a settlement with John Armitage over disputed land, for the founding of the actual village of Greenhow. Prior to this date the only settlement recorded on the Hill itself was Kell House, where monks of Fountains Abbey lived while guarding the abbey's lead interests.\n\nIn 1613, an agreement sought to protect the Greenhow miners' rights: \"\"…there may be cottages erected for the miners and mineral workmen upon the said waste … and also for the keeping of draught oxen and horses for the maintenance of the mines, always leaving the tenants sufficient common\".\"\n\nJoseph Kipling, the grandfather of Rudyard Kipling was the minister at the Methodist Chapel at Greenhow and Rudyard himself is known to have visited the village. There is a 'Kiplings Cottage' next door to the 'Miners Arms', but it is not known whether his grandfather actually lived there.\n\nThe church in the village (St Mary's) is reputedly the highest parish church in England still in use, though services are now only fortnightly on Sunday evenings plus major feast times.\n\nTo the east of the village is Coldstones Quarry, operated by Hanson. The quarry is unusual in that it is located on high ground and is not easy to observe from above like most other quarries in the Yorkshire Dales. The quarry produces of limestone aggregate per year, with most being used in West and North Yorkshire. Small amounts of fluorspar are also won from the limestone which is sent to Derbyshire for processing. A large public artwork, \"The Coldstones Cut\", has been created by the artist Andrew Sabin, and was opened in 2010.\n\nThe name \"Greenhow Hill\" is also applied to a section of the B6265 road which runs between Pateley Bridge and Grassington through the village of Greenhow. The road has a very steep descent into Pateley Bridge from Greenhow (between 16 and 19%) and has been the setting for many accidents, especially for people on bicycles. This stretch of road is very popular with cyclists; it was part of the 2016 Tour de Yorkshire and is part of the Way of the Roses bike trail.\n\nGreenhow Hill (), is also the summit point between Nidderdale to the east and Wharfedale to the west.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the Town of Kittery, in York County.\n\nAppledore Island was originally settled by Europeans in the colonial era, when the ease of transport by water made farming on island economically efficient. A church was established in 1640. Near 1700, the entire settlement on this island moved to Star Island in New Hampshire to escape taxes imposed by Massachusetts (of which Maine was then a province).\n\nThe heyday of the island was the artists salon that thrived there in the late 19th century, before the advent of artists' colonies as we know them today. Celia Thaxter reigned over an impressive group of friends who were also the leading artists, musicians, and writers of the day. These included Edward MacDowell and his wife; American pianist William Mason, son of Lowell Mason, who played the grand piano in her salon daily; and John Knowles Paine, America's first serious composer of note. Childe Hassam painted Celia's magnificent garden in a style similar to Monet's Giverny paintings. This rarefied atmosphere ended with Thaxter's death in 1894. The hotel burned in 1914, bringing down the final curtain on this heyday in American arts. A charming small original daybook from this time period was re-published in part, in 1992, titled \"The Isles of Shoals Remembered\", by Caleb Mason, author page here: http://www.dontrowden.com/\n\nToday, the island is home to Shoals Marine Laboratory, run cooperatively by Cornell University and the University of New Hampshire since the early 1970s. Appledore Island is owned predominantly by the Star Island Corporation.\n\nThe most prominent feature on the island is a World War II concrete observation tower built to hold a radar installation. The dome intended to hold the radar no longer exists, and the radar unit was never installed.\n\nThe maximum elevation of Appledore is about 80 feet above sea level. The majority of the island has a metamorphic makeup, with gneiss being the most prevalent. The formation of the island is thought to be characterized by 5 major geological events, namely formation of the Rye Complex of Maine and New Hampshire, intrusion of diorites, Acadian orogeny, diabase dikes, and glaciation.\n\nEvidence of these events can be seen in glacial scarps, evidence of abrasion, presence of dikes, glacial plucking, and more. For example, glacial plucking contributed to the whaleback shape of the island which is resultant of rock drumlin cliff faces.\n\n\n"}

There, he served as the team's backup catcher behind future Hall of Fame member Carlton Fisk. He spent the next nine years with the Red Sox and played his last game on September 9, 1979. Montgomery is most famous for being the last major league player to bat without wearing a batting helmet.\n\nMontgomery was born on April 16, 1944, in Nashville, Tennessee. Baseball played a huge role in his family; his father frequently took part in sandlot ball, while his brother Gerald played for several minor league affiliates of the Boston Red Sox.

Playing both third base and the outfield, he batted .273, enough to earn him a promotion to the Class-A Waterloo Hawks of the Midwest League in the following season. It was here that Montgomery was encouraged by manager Len Okrie to switch positions to catcher, in order to improve his chances of being promoted into the major leagues.\n\nIn , Major League Baseball made it compulsory for all players to wear batting helmets, although active players like Montgomery were allowed to continue batting without one per a grandfather clause. Montgomery opted to utilize this privilege, choosing to strengthen the inside of his cap with protective lining instead.

His mother was the daughter, and along with her two sisters, the heiress, of the rich General John Scott of Fife.\n\nBentinck was known by the name George, as at the time all the men in his family were given the first name William. He was educated privately and grew up on his father's Welbeck Abbey estate in Nottinghamshire and at Fullarton House, near Troon, Ayrshire, where his father was developing the docks.\n\nIn 1818, Bentinck and his older brother John joined the army, but personal conflicts derailed his military career.

Ker levelled charges against Bentinck of \"inattention to duty and contemptuous, insubordinate and disrespectful behaviour.\" Bentinck requested an inquiry into the charges and was ultimately cleared. However, the incident would not die and in May 1821, in Paris, Bentinck and Ker were prepared to duel. Bentinck's uncle George Canning, interceded and stopped the event.\n\nBentinck returned to England and exchanged regiments, with the plan of going to India. In May 1822, he was assigned as \"aide-de-camp\" to Canning, who had accepted the position of Governor-General of India. Instead, Canning became foreign secretary after The Marquess of Londonderry committed suicide. Canning requested both George and John be his non-stipendiary private secretaries \"to wean them from their too great zeal in the chase and too great idleness in every other respect.\" John declined, joining the Life Guard Regiment, but George accepted the position.\n\nIn 1824, the death of their eldest brother, Henry, the Marquess of Titchfield, caused another change of plans. John became the Marquess of Titchfield and George took his place in the Life Guards, \"it being the duke of Portland's wish that he should now take to the army as his profession.\"\n\nOnce again conflicts arose; in July 1825, Bentinck engaged a junior officer in a bloodless duel over an incident related to the mess accounts. Bentinck then left the regiment and took half-pay with the rank of major.\n\nIn 1828, he ran unopposed as the Whig representative for King's Lynn before moving over to join the Conservative Party (via the Derby Dilly parliamentary faction) by about 1835–6. Bentinck held King's Lynn until his death.\n\nBefore his interest in active politics in the 1840s, Bentinck was far better known for his interest in \"the Turf.\" He was a notorious gambler, often losing substantial amounts. Bentinck owned several successful racehorses and his stable, which he established at Goodwood, was renowned for its quality. During the 1845 season, it was estimated that he had won more than £100,000.\n\nBentinck made strenuous efforts to eliminate fraud in the sport (although his own behaviour in fixing odds was not always scrupulous). In 1844, having exposed the winner of the Derby as a fraud, he proposed a set of rules to cover horse racing. By a series of legal actions he also limited the corruption involved in making and settlement of bets, deriving from outdated legislation. He is also credited with inventing the flag start at a race meeting at Goodwood. Prior to that races had been started by the starter shouting. Although something of a \"self-appointed vigilante\", he is now seen as a great innovator and reformer of the sport. \n\nThough he was an \"aristocratic dandy\" who wore a new silk scarf every day, Bentinck's volatile temper again got him in trouble. He nearly lost his life in a duel over an unpaid debt. He fired his pistol in the air as his opponent, Squire Osbaldeston, an expert marksman, was flustered and missed, shooting Bentinck cleanly through the hat.\n\nDespite his success in horse racing, his father reportedly strongly disapproved of this activity, and the duke was delighted when his son returned to \"the more elevated occupations of political society.\" To commit himself to his political career, in 1846, Bentinck sold his entire stables and racing team for the bargain price of £10,000.\n\nBentinck first became prominent in politics in 1846 when he, with Disraeli, led the protectionist opposition to the repeal of the Corn Laws. Until he rose to speak against their repeal, he had not spoken a word in 18 years in Parliament. Historians see Bentinck's participation as vital, for the majority of those who opposed repeal were country gentlemen, who were far more likely to follow the son of a Duke than Disraeli, an Anglicized Sephardic-Jewish literary figure, then of dubious repute. The Bentinck-Disraeli relationship culminated in Bentinck offering to provide a £25,000 loan for Disraeli's purchase of Hughenden Manor in 1848.\n\nAlthough Bentinck and Disraeli did not prevent the repeal of the Corn Laws, they did succeed in forcing Peel's resignation some weeks later over the Irish Coercion Bill. The Conservative Party broke in half; some hundred free-trade Peelites followed Peel, while 230 protectionists formed the new Conservative Party, with Stanley (later the Earl of Derby) as overall leader. Bentinck became leader of the party in the House of Commons. He unsuccessfully led calls upon the government of Lord John Russell to alleviate suffering in Ireland arising from the Irish famine by investing in a substantial railway construction programme.\n\nBentinck resigned the leadership in 1848, his support of Jewish emancipation being unpopular with the bulk of the party, and was succeeded by the Marquess of Granby.\n\nOn 21 September 1848, Bentinck left his father's home at Welbeck Abbey at 3 pm, intending to walk through \"The Dukeries\" to Thoresby Hall to dine with Charles Pierrepont, 2nd Earl Manvers. A search party was sent to look for him when he did not arrive at Thoresby, and his body was ultimately found at 9 p.m. He was aged 46.\n\nInitial reports stated it appeared he died of \"apoplexy,\" but it is believed he died of a heart attack. Although there were rumours of suicide (or even murder), his autopsy clearly showed emphysema and congestion of the lungs. Bentinck, who was unmarried (there were rumours that he and his brother Lord Henry were, in the phraseology of the time, \"woman haters\"), was buried in the Duke of Portland vault at Marylebone Old Church in London.\n\nHe is commemorated with a statue in London's Cavendish Square Gardens, a memorial close to the spot where he died near Worksop, and a large gothic memorial by Thomas Chambers Hine erected in Mansfield.\n\nCharles Greville (who had once been a partner of Bentinck in a horse-racing syndicate) wrote of him after his death: \"He brought into politics the same ardour, activity, industry and cleverness which he had displayed on the turf . . . having once espoused a cause and espoused a party, from whatever motive, he worked with all the force of his intellect and a superhuman power of application in what he perceived to be the interest of that party and that cause . . . <nowiki>[However]</nowiki> I have not the least doubt that, for his own reputation and celebrity, he died at the most opportune period; his fame had probably reached its zenith, and credit was given him for greater abilities than he possessed.\"\n\nThe department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham holds the correspondence and personal papers of Lord George Bentinck, as part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released by SuperEgo Records on May 3, 2005. It is a concept album, telling the story of two characters who run off with each other to escape their problems, but end up in more trouble than either of them could have imagined. The album reflects Mann's own boxing in its story and illustrations. The title is derived from a move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to \"forget\" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow.\n\nThe album won the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for Mann and Gail Marowitz (art directors).\n\nThe album so far has a score of 70 out of 100 from Metacritic based on \"generally favorable reviews\". \"Prefix Magazine\" gave the album a score of seven out of ten and said it has \"Enough bending guitar licks to satisfy the yuppiest of thirtysomething businessmen and enough mellow ballads to satisfy your Dixie Chicks-loving mom.\" \"Trouser Press\" gave it a positive review and said, \"Some of the songs are immediately engrossing... Others mostly carry the story forward while allowing Mann to indulge her career-long taste for vintage keyboard orchestration, coolly elegant pop arrangements and displays of tart wordplay.\" E! Online gave it a B− and said it \"reveals how straight-up dull Mann's country-tinged songs can be.\" Other reviews are very average, mixed or negative: \"Mojo\" gave it three stars out of five and called it \"an unfussy affair\". \"Blender\" gave it two stars out of five and said of Mann, \"If she doesn't follow commercial formulas, she's following creative ones, and selling herself short in the process.\" \"The A.V. Club\" gave it an unfavorable review and said, \"Mann's signature wordplay sounds clichéd and exhausted, and her melodies lack the energy and pop sparkle that distinguished her pre-\"Lost In Space\" work.\"\n\nAll songs written by Aimee Mann.\n\n\n\n\nThe album details, in a series of vignettes, the story of John, a Vietnam vet and boxer, and his \"kind of white trash\" girlfriend Caroline, who meet at the Virginia State Fair in the 1970s, where John is boxing an exhibition round. They get the idea that they can escape their problems by running off together and travelling across the United States. However, their relationship begins to fray as John's addiction to alcohol comes to light. In Vegas, John leaves Caroline to try to get help (\"Goodbye Caroline\") but resists treatment (\"I Can't Get My Head Around It\") and finally Caroline gives up on trying to help John (\"I Can't Help You Anymore\"). However, the album's final song indicates that everything works out somehow, although much later. \"It's a character study and a relationship study,\" Mann says\n\nThe Japanese edition of \"The Forgotten Arm\" contains a bonus track (\"Who Knows\"). This minute-long track acts as an epilogue to the story of Caroline & John, with the following lyrics:\n\nReleased in 2005-2006\n\nSET- LIST:\nEncore:\n"}

The university maintains two campuses in Greater London, in Richmond Hill and Kensington.\n\nThe university awards US degrees from the American state of Delaware, where Richmond is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Until 2018, Richmond's UK degrees were awarded by the Open University; but from the 2018/2019 academic year, Richmond has been able to grant its own UK degrees, after receiving Taught Degree Awarding Powers from the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. This mean that all students at Richmond gain both a UK and US degree studying one programme.\n\nRichmond was founded in 1972 by the social entrepreneur and politician Cyril Taylor, chairman of the American Institute For Foreign Study (AIFS), as Richmond College, The American College in London. It began teaching on the site of the former Richmond Theological College, part of the University of London, founded in 1843 as a Methodist theological college. AIFS had been previously using the college site for a number of years for their London study abroad programmes. AIFS purchased half of the college's 10 acre site for £300,000 (equivalent to £3.82 million in 2015), including the majority of its buildings and front lawns, to form a new American liberal arts college. A second campus was opened on St Albans Grove and Ansdell Street in Kensington in 1978 for third and fourth year students as well as the college's US Study Abroad Programme.\n\nIn its early years Richmond served mainly to house study abroad programmes to US students, however this changed in 1981 when Richmond obtained a licence to award US undergraduate degrees from the Washington DC Board of Education and formal accreditation from the Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges (now the Middle States Commission on Higher Education). With this it became a fully accredited independent liberal arts university. Following the closure of the Washington DC Board of Education, Richmond gained a licence to award degrees in Delaware, which continues to be used for its US degrees.\n\nAn expansion of the university's Kensington campus on Young Street was officially opened in March 1988 by Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nIn 1995 AIFS spun-off the university as a non-profit educational institution. Richmond inaugurated its first postgraduate degree in 1998 with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2018 Richmond issued British degrees validated by the Open University. In May 2018, the University was granted Taught Degree Awarding Powers in the UK, enabling students to receive two degree certificates, from the US and UK.\n\nIn December 2019 the university president, Lawrence Abeln, resigned after filing a complaint with the Charity Commission against the Cyril Taylor Charitable Foundation, the main financial backers of the university. In January 2020 financial problems caused by the dispute with the foundation led the board of trustees to suspend recruitment of students for the spring term.\n\nIn March 2020 the university signed an agreement with the Hong Kong based China Education Group (CEG), giving Richmond students access to internships and exchange programs across CEG's universities and institutes in China and Australia as well as expanding Richmond's international marketing and recruitment. The partners said the deal would \"secure the long-term future of the university\".\n\nThe board of trustees is responsible for the stewardship of the university's assets, strategic decision-making and ensuring compliance with its objectives. The board is chaired by Roger King, a former vice-chancellor of the University of Lincoln.\n\nThe current president of Richmond, since December 2019, is Phil Deans.\n\nRichmond had an average of 163 staff, including 83 academic staff, 68 management and administrative staff and 12 technical staff, during the year ending 30 June 2017.\n\nIn the financial year ending 30 June 2017, Richmond (including the UK charity the Richmond Foundation, which is controlled by the university) had a total income of £35.7 million (including a one-off donation of £10 million from Cyril Taylor) and total expenditure of £25.2 million\n\nRichmond, The American International University in London is composed of three constituent schools:\n\nRichmond offers a range of majors and minors at undergraduate level in business, economics, political science, international relations, media, the arts and humanities.\n\nStandard degrees are four-years long though may be completed earlier through transfer credits from US Advanced Placement classes, UK A and AS Levels, the International Baccalaureate and other similar qualifications.

The University's BA psychology degree is accredited in partnership with the British Psychological Society.\n\nRichmond is a \"recognised body\" that can award UK degrees, subject to regular inspection by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) and regulation by the Office for Students. The last QAA inspection was in May 2016, which led to the award of taught degree awarding powers (following Richmond's addressing of concerns raised in the report) for a six year period from 17 May 2017 to 16 May 2024. Prior to this, Richmond's UK degrees were validated by the Open University.\n\nRichmond is accredited in the US State of Delaware by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, an accrediting body recognized by the United States Department of Education. Richmond is licensed to award US Associate in Arts, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts and Master of Business Administration degrees by the Department of Education in the State of Delaware.\n\nThe university is split between two main campuses in the Greater London area: the Richmond campus, located near the crest of Richmond Hill and approximately from Richmond station, and the Kensington campus, located between Kensington High Street and Cromwell Road.\n\nRichmond's library facilities across both the Hill and Kensington Campuses include over 60,000 books and DVDs, 39,000 e-journal titles and 36,000 newspapers and newswires.\n\nThe Richmond campus is the primary residence of undergraduate students in their first two years of study and its main building is a major symbol for the university. The university's headquarters and admissions department are also located here. The main building and surrounding subsidiary buildings occupy the site of the former Richmond Theological College, University of London, purchased by Cyril Taylor. It features a multi-purpose sports court, spacious front lawns and a variety of historic forest land. It sits close to one of the main gates of Richmond Park.\n\nThe Kensington campus is a closely grouped set of buildings located between Kensington High Street and Gloucester Road. It is where many of the upper-level undergraduate students reside during their last two year along with all postgraduate programmes. Kensington is the housing location for many study abroad students at the university.\n\nIn addition to its London campuses Richmond also maintains three specialist study centres in Leeds, Florence and Rome. The Leeds centre, located on the campus of Leeds Beckett University focuses on a combination of soccer training and sports management while Florence and Rome specializes in the study of history along with the studio and fine arts.\n\nThe RAIUL Student Government is the university's official students' union under the Education Act 1994. It organises a range of social activities on both campuses throughout the year and orientation weeks. It also lobbies senior faculty, management staff and the Board of Trustees on behalf of students in relation to issues of welfare, discrimination and academic appeals.\n\nRichmond's Student Affairs Department offer a variety of clubs and societies for students to get involved in including Model United Nations, Gaming, Film production, journalism, Art Appreciation, Theatre, Finance and Investment, Debating, Fashion, Environmentalism, History, Politics, International Affairs, Journalism, Psychology, Community Service, Great British Bake Off and LGBTQ+.\n\nRichmond International Academic and Soccer Academy (RIASA) is the school's sports academy.\n\nSports facilities at the Richmond Hill campus include a gym and fitness studio and multi-purpose soccer, basketball, tennis and volleyball court.

He was later also MP for Appleby. He enjoyed the patronage of John Lambert, who he served under during the First English Civil War, which helped his parliamentary career, but also later led to his downfall when the Royalists regained power in 1660.\n\nAdam Baynes was the eldest son of Robert Baynes and Joan Brown, of Knostrop Hall, east of Leeds, where his family had resided since at least the middle of the sixteenth century. He was baptised on 22 December 1622 in Leeds.\n\nDuring the First English Civil War, Baynes joined the Parliamentarian army, serving under Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax. After initially serving as a captain in the infantry, he raised a cavalry troop, and subsequently fought at the battles of Adwalton Moor and Marston Moor. He subsequently served as an officer under John Lambert, who had command of the northern brigade from August 1647. Baynes was moved to London, where he acted as the brigade's financial agent, purchasing lands, soldier's debts and estates for his fellow officers. He purchased the Holdenby House estate for himself in 1650, though he was criticised for the personal profits he made from the transactions.\n\nHe married Martha () in July 1650, and the pair had sixteen children, ten of whom outlived Baynes. The patronage of Lambert helped Baynes to gain election to the First Protectorate Parliament in 1654, and he was returned again two years later to the Second Protectorate Parliament. He was described as \"an army agent of some influence at Whitehall\", and was generally sympathetic towards Quakers. After Lambert was removed from his position by Oliver Cromwell, Baynes also left his position, though it is unclear if he was removed or resigned. In 1659, Leeds did not have a seat in Parliament, and Baynes was instead elected as an MP for Appleby. Baynes continued to support Lambert in the House of Commons, opposing the vote to make Richard Cromwell the second Lord Protector. The dissolution of The Protectorate in 1659 allowed Baynes to return to the Army, but a year later the Royalist favouring Convention Parliament had him arrested and had to forfeit the crown lands he had purchased. He kept most of his Holdenby estate and received an appointment as \"crown receiver for the manor of Leeds\".\n\nHe suffered financial issues in the mid-1660s, and was sent to the Tower of London in 1666 for \"treasonable practices\". He died around 5 January 1671, and left \"houses, coalpits, and a 'considerable colliery'\" to his family.\n\n"}

He stayed there for two and a half years, signing with Valencia CF who immediately loaned him for the rest of the season to Real Valladolid, which he helped narrowly avoid relegation from La Liga.\n\nSubsequently, Campo returned to Valencia only to be released, joining recently promoted team RCD Mallorca. In the Balearic Islands, he formed a formidable partnership with Marcelino Elena (later of Newcastle United), as they finished fifth in 1997–98.\n\nIn 1998, Campo signed with Real Madrid, and contributed to the 1999–2000 conquest of the UEFA Champions League, playing the full 90 minutes in the final against former club Valencia.\n\nAfter falling out of favor at Real, Campo was sent to Bolton Wanderers on a one-year loan in August 2002. Following the 2002–03 campaign he was expected to return to the Spanish capital, but unexpectedly signed a three-year permanent deal with the English club, deciding he preferred living in Bolton.\n\nOn 19 August 2006, in the first match of the new season, Campo scored a 43-yard drive which caught Tottenham Hotspur and England's Paul Robinson off-guard and flew into the bottom corner of the net. In a post-match interview, his boss Sam Allardyce admitted Bolton's goal of the season competition may have already been decided by the wonder strike.\n\nCampo fitted in well with Bolton's style of play, but also topped the charts for most red and yellow cards received of any player in the Premier League in 2006–07. In May 2008, he was not offered a new contract by manager Gary Megson and left the team.\n\nShortly before the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament, Campo wrote a letter to the Bolton supporters expressing his regret at not having been able to bid the club a proper farewell, and the letter appeared on a website run by Sky Sports presenter Guillem Balagué. He eventually played in a testimonial match at the Reebok Stadium, in honour of teammate Jussi Jääskeläinen.\n\nOn 11 August 2008, Campo signed for Ipswich Town in the Football League Championship after passing a medical. He scored his first goal against Barnsley in a 3–0 win, but after only featuring in roughly a third of the league's matches for the club, the 35-year-old was released by manager Roy Keane at the end of the season.\n\nIn December 2009, Campo joined Cypriot Second Division side AEK Larnaca FC. He retired in June of the following year aged 36, having appeared in 124 Spanish first division games in seven years and 194 competitive matches for Bolton.\n\nCampo played four times with Spain, his debut coming on 25 March 1998 in a 4–0 friendly win over Sweden, in Vigo.

{"id": "2145881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145881", "title": "Heptachlor", "text": "Heptachlor\n\nHeptachlor is an organochlorine compound that was used as an insecticide. Usually sold as a white or tan powder, heptachlor is one of the cyclodiene insecticides. In 1962, Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring\" questioned the safety of heptachlor and other chlorinated insecticides. Due to its highly stable structure, heptachlor can persist in the environment for decades. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has limited the sale of heptachlor products to the specific application of fire ant control in underground transformers. The amount that can be present in different foods is regulated.\n\nAnalogous to the synthesis of other cyclodienes, heptachlor is produced via the Diels-Alder reaction of hexachlorocyclopentadiene and cyclopentadiene. The resulting adduct is chlorinated followed by treatment with hydrogen chloride in nitromethane in the presence of aluminum trichloride or with iodine monochloride.\n\nCompared to chlordane, it is about 3–5 times more active as an insecticide, but more inert chemically, being resistant to water and caustic alkalies.\n\nSoil microorganisms transform heptachlor by epoxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction. When the compound was incubated with a mixed culture of organisms, chlordene (hexachlorocyclopentadine, its precursor) formed, which was further metabolized to chlordene epoxide. Other metabolites include 1-hydroxychlordene, 1-hydroxy-2,3-epoxychlordene, and heptachlor epoxide. Soil microorganisms hydrolyze heptachlor to give ketochlordene. Rats metabolize heptachlor to the epoxide 1-exo-1-hydroxyheptachlor epoxide and 1,2-dihydrooxydihydrochlordene. When heptachlor epoxide was incubated with microsomal preparations form liver of pigs and from houseflies, the products found were diol and 1-hydroxy-2,3-epoxychlordene. The metabolic scheme in rats shows two pathways with the same metabolite. The first involves following scheme: heptachlor → heptachlor epoxide → dehydrogenated derivative of 1-exo-hydroxy-2,3-exo-epoxychlordene → 1,2-dihydrooxydihydrochlordene. The second involves: heptachlor → 1-exo-hydroxychlordene → 1-exo-hydroxy, 2,3-exo-epoxychlordene → 1,2-dihydrooxydihydrochlordene.\n\nHeptachlor is persistent organic pollutant (POP). It has a half life of ~1.3-4.2 days (air), ~0.03-0.11 years (water), and ~0.11-0.34 years (soil). One study described its half life to be 2 years and claimed that its residues could be found in soil 14 years after its initial application. Like other POPs, heptachlor is lipophilic and poorly soluble in water (0.056 mg/L at 25 °C), thus it tends to accumulate in the body fat of humans and animals. \n\nHeptachlor epoxide is more likely to be found in the environment than its parent compound. The epoxide also dissolves more easily in water than its parent compound and is more persistent. Heptachlor and its epoxide absorb to soil particles and evaporate.\n\nThe range of oral rat values are 40 mg/kg to 162 mg/kg. Daily oral doses of heptachlor at 50 and 100 mg/kg were found to be lethal to rats after 10 days. For heptachlor epoxide, the oral LD values ranging from 46.5 to 60 mg/kg. With rat oral of LD47mg/kg, heptachlor epoxide is more toxic. A product of hydrogenation of heptachlor, β-dihydroheptachlor, has high insecticidal activity and low mammalian toxicity, rat oral LD>5,000mg/kg.\n\nHumans may be exposed to heptachlor through drinking water and foods, including breast milk. Heptachlor epoxide is derived from a pesticide that was banned in the U.S. in the 1980s. It is still found in soil and water supplies and can turn up in food. It can be passed along in breast milk.\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer and the EPA have classified the compound as a possible human carcinogen. Animals exposed to heptachlor epoxide during gestation and infancy are found to have changes in nervous system and immune function. Exposure to higher doses of heptachlor in newborn animals leads to decreased body weight and death.\n\nThe U.S. EPA MCL for drinking water is 0.0004 mg/L for heptachlor and 0.0002 mg/L for heptachlor epoxide. The U.S. FDA limit on food crops is 0.01 ppm, in milk 0.1 ppm, and on edible seafoods 0.3 ppm. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has limit of 0.5 mg/m (cubic meter of workplace air) for 8-hour shifts and 40-hour work weeks.\n\nAn ATSDR report in 1993 found no studies with respect to death in humans after oral exposure to heptachlor or heptachlor epoxide.\n\nThe octanol-water partition coefficient (K) of heptachlor is ~10. Henry's Law constant is 2.3 · 10atm-m/mol and the vapor pressure is 3 · 10mmHg at 20 °C.\n\n"}
{"id": "2145882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145882", "title": "How It Is", "text": "How It Is\n\nHow It Is is a novel by Samuel Beckett first published in French as \"Comment c'est\" by Les Editions de Minuit in 1961. The Grove Press (New York) published Beckett's English translation in 1964. An advance text of his English translation of the third part appeared in the 1962 issue of the Australian literary journal, \"Arna\". \n\n\"L'Image\", an early variant version of \"Comment c'est\", was published in the British arts review, \"X: A Quarterly Review\" (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.\n\nThe novel is a monologue by the narrator as he crawls through endless mud, recalling his life separated into three distinct periods.\n\nThe title is Beckett's literal translation of the French phrase, \"comment c'est\" (how it is), a pun on the French verb \"commencer\" or 'to begin'. \n\nThe text is divided into three parts:\n\n\"before Pim\" - the solitary narrator journeys in the mud-dark until he encounters another creature like himself thereby forming a \"couple\". His journey is abundant with recollections from his life above, including reminiscences of a woman and of his parents.\n\n\"with Pim\" - the narrator is motionless in the mud-dark until he is abandoned by Pim.\n\n\"after Pim\" - the narrator returns to his earlier solitude but without motion in the mud-dark. He postulates that there must be several others like him and Pim. As the attempted explanation however requires a constant accumulation of ad hoc hypotheses, he acknowledges the wish for a simpler explanation. Only the mud and the obscurity remain certainties.\n\nIn a letter (April 6, 1960) to Donald McWhinnie of the BBC Radio Drama Company, Beckett explained his strange text as the product of a \" 'man' lying panting in the mud and dark murmuring his 'life' as he hears it obscurely uttered by a voice inside him... The noise of his panting fills his ears and it is only when this abates that he can catch and murmur forth a fragment of what is being stated within... It is in the third part that occurs the so-called voice 'quaqua', its interiorisation and murmuring forth when the panting stops. That is to say the 'I' is from the outset in the third part and the first and second, though stated as heard in the present, already over.\" \n\nThe theme may be the struggle of form to emerge from formlessness using Leopardi's sense of the world as mud (\"E fango è il mondo\") and therefore, a kind of purgatory, as well as Dante's image of souls gulping mud in the Stygian marsh of the \"Inferno\" (Canto VII, 109–126, in Palma's translation):\n\nDante's Belacqua and his foetal position also are referenced in \"How It Is\" and the following quotation is an example of the work's unpunctuated, dense, and poetic style: \n\nThe novel served as inspiration for Miroslaw Balka's 2009 work, \"How It Is\", in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall.\n\nThe character of the 'Angsal', the mysterious angel in Jerry Hunter's mud-soaked novel \"Ebargofiant\" (Y Lolfa, 2014) is an intertextual reference.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2145885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145885", "title": "Mason &amp; Hamlin", "text": "Mason &amp; Hamlin\n\nMason & Hamlin is a piano manufacturer based in Haverhill, Massachusetts. Founded in 1854, they also manufactured a large number of pump organs during the 19th century.\n\nMason & Hamlin was founded in Boston, Massachusetts in 1854 by Henry Mason, son of Lowell Mason, the American hymn composer and musical educator, and Emmons Hamlin, a mechanic and inventor who had worked for melodeon makers Prince & Co. in Buffalo, New York.\n\nThey originally manufactured only melodeons, but in 1855 introduced the \"organ-harmonium\" or flat-topped cabinet organ. This design placed the bellows vertically and underneath the reeds, and served as the model for the suction operated American-style reed organ. By the early 1870s they were considered the largest and most important manufacturer of reed organs, employing about 500 and producing as many as 200 instruments a week. Mason & Hamlin supplied organs to several prominent composers, notably Franz Liszt, whose name the company applied to their patented selective sustain mechanism for organs comparable to the sostenuto in pianos.\n\nMason & Hamlin began manufacturing pianos in 1883. Initially they built only upright pianos featuring a patented method of tuning and maintaining string tension which they marketed as the \"screw stringer\" and intended as an improvement over the traditional system with tuning pins. In 1895, the piano department was completely reorganized by Richard W. Gertz, an independent piano designer from Germany who had created new scales for them earlier that year. Gertz was elected secretary of the company in 1903, and president in 1906, and had patented the company's \"Tension Resonator\", a device fastened to the perimeter of the wooden structure of pianos meant to prevent their sounding boards from flattening. This was first included in their grands in 1900. The firm advertises that it is currently used in all Mason & Hamlin pianos.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the Golden Age of the Piano was in full force and the most illustrious concert artists of the day aligned themselves with piano manufacturers including Sergei Rachmaninoff whose 1924 recording of his Second Piano Concerto was made using a Mason & Hamlin. Composer Maurice Ravel said of Mason & Hamlin pianos, \"While preserving all the qualities of the percussion instrument, the Mason & Hamlin pianoforte also serves magnificently the composer's concept by its extensive range in dynamics, as well as quality of tone. It is not short of being a small orchestra. In my opinion, the Mason & Hamlin is a real work of art.\"\n\nThe Cable Company, a Chicago piano manufacturing company, owned an interest in Mason & Hamlin from 1904 to 1924, when it was sold to the American Piano Company. Mason & Hamlin's role in this company was later described as the \"artist's\"' brand among the firm's premier lines which included Chickering and Sons (\"family use\") and Wm. Knabe & Co. (\"Metropolitan Opera's favorite\"). American's sales began to decline in 1928, and following its collapse in the wake of the stock market collapse in late 1929, Mason & Hamlin's trademark, inventory and equipment were sold to American's competitor Aeolian for $450,000 while the factory buildings were sold off separately by the end of the following year. In 1932 it became part of Aeolian-American when the two companies merged, which consolidated the control of more than twenty brands of pianos; Mason & Hamlin, which had been at the former Hallet, Davis & Company piano factory in Neponset, Massachusetts, was moved to a separate plant at the Aeolian-American complex in East Rochester, New York at this time. During this time the company began sponsoring the Mason and Hamlin Prize piano competition.\n\nPiano manufacturing ceased in the United States in 1942 under authority of the War Production Board due to the Second World War, and Mason & Hamlin production shifted to military gliders. Ownership of Mason & Hamlin changed hands several times during the post-war era, becoming part of the Sohmer piano company in 1985. Over the decades, the designs of the pianos were altered to the extent that they had little in common with the \"classic\" Mason & Hamlin pianos of the pre-Depression era. \n\nIn 1989, Seattle businessman Bernard \"Bud\" Greer purchased the Sohmer company, which also held the George Steck, Knabe, and Mason & Hamlin names, technical specifications, and manufacturing equipment. He moved these to a piano factory in Haverhill, Massachusetts, which he had recently purchased from piano manufacturer Santi Falcone—from whom he also purchased the Falcone manufacturing specifications and naming rights. He named the new enterprise the \"Mason & Hamlin Companies\". Greer's goal was to resurrect the Mason & Hamlin pianos of the pre-Depression era by returning to the original specifications—including Gertz's scale designs—and use of materials. A few changes were made, including the use of Renner action parts and slightly longer keys. From 1990 to 1994, approximately 600 pianos were manufactured, mostly Model A and BB grands, along with a few Model 50 uprights. Greer sold the company in 1995 to Premier Pianos, which continued production at a reduced pace until selling the company in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Mason & Hamlin was acquired by Burgett, Inc., which also owns PianoDisc, a maker of reproducing piano systems of the same name. Mason & Hamlin pianos are still manufactured in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and distributed throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. Mason & Hamlin is a member of NAMM, the International Music Products Association and Piano Manufacturers Association International.\n\nEach Mason & Hamlin piano includes a \"Tension Resonator\", which is a system of steel rods under moderate tension, anchored to the wooden structure on the opposite side of the sounding board from the strings and iron frame. In grand pianos these rods fan out from one or two central hubs and are attached at intervals around the rim and to the belly rail; the model 50 upright has a rod stretched between the case sides. The manufacturer claims that this adds strength and rigidity to the rim by locking the rim into its permanent shape and which in turn preserves the \"crown\" of the soundboard. \n\n"}

Pfingston (January 2, 1940 – June 23, 2007) was a senior airman in the United States Air Force who served as the 10th Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force from 1990 to 1994.\n\nPfingston was born in Evansville, Indiana on January 2, 1940. In California, he graduated from Torrance High School in 1958 and attended El Camino College from 1958 through 1961.\n\nPfingston entered the United States Air Force in February 1962. He spent his early years as a B-52 Crew Chief at Castle Air Force Base, California from 1962 to 1968 and then worked on B-52s and KC-135s at Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York from 1968 to 1972. After serving in Thailand at U-Tapao Royal Thai Air Base between 1972 and 1973, he became a military Training Instructor at Lackland Air Force Base in 1973. In 1979 he became Commandant of the Military Training Instructor School. Promoted first sergeant in 1982, he was then between 1984 and 1990 a Senior Enlisted Advisor at George Air Force Base, California; Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas; and Pacific Air Forces Headquarters, Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii.\n\nOn August 1, 1990 Pfingston was appointed Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. Pfingston's focus during his tenure was tackling the Air Force's draw-down and decreasing budget. After Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) issues arose during increased deployments during the Gulf War, he worked to continue BAS for Airmen living in field conditions and toward increasing Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) amounts. His toughest challenge was Air Force downsizing. With a goal of avoiding involuntary separations during the ongoing force draw-down, he worked to get the Voluntary Separation Incentive and Special Separation Bonus programs established. He retired on October 25, 1994, and died of cancer on June 23, 2007.\n"}
{"id": "2145937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145937", "title": "Naked (Talking Heads album)", "text": "Naked (Talking Heads album)\n\nNaked is the eighth and final studio album by American rock band Talking Heads, released on March 15, 1988 by Sire Records. The band dissolved shortly after the album's release, but did not announce their breakup until 1991.\n\nWanting to try something different after their use of regional American music and the pop song format on their previous two albums \"Little Creatures\" (1985) and \"True Stories\" (1986), Talking Heads decided to record their next album in Paris with a group of international musicians. Prior to leaving for France, the band recorded about 40 improvisational tracks that would serve as the foundation for the sessions in Paris.\n\nIn Paris, the band, along with producer Steve Lillywhite, were joined by a number of other musicians in the recording studio where they would rehearse and play for the entire day. At the end of each day, one take was selected as being the ideal version of a particular tune. \"Paris is a wonderful place to work,\" observed drummer Chris Frantz in the liner notes of \"\". \"We were really embracing world culture fully.\" In the interest of freedom for the musicians, it was decided that lyrics and melodies would be left until later. The lyrics were not overdubbed until the band returned to New York. Many of David Byrne's lyrics were improvisations sung along with the prerecorded tracks until he found something that he felt worked. In this way, the melodies and lyrics evolved in a similar fashion as the songs themselves.\n\n\"Naked\" was well-received by critics, who hailed it as a vast improvement over \"True Stories\". Chris Willman from the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the band abandoned \"the stripped-down four-piece rock approach of late\" in favor of a \"far more eclectic big-band, world music extravaganza.\" In \"Rolling Stone\", Anthony DeCurtis called the album \"stylistically bold and intellectually provocative,\" a \"dizzying and disturbing piece of work\" that \"marks a return to the more open-ended, groove-oriented style the Heads defined on \"Remain in Light\".\" He noted that \"the vital human harmony suggested by the international band of players .. is the strongest counterpoint to the album's pervasive themes of alienation and dread.\" He concluded by interpreting the view of the album's lyrics: \"The human race consists of some pretty cool people ... but it's got a very destructive monkey on its back. Human survival is not guaranteed. With humor and good-hearted-ness [\"sic\"], hope and fear, Talking Heads contemplate a world on the eve of destruction on this important record — and leave wide open the question of what the dawn will bring.\"\n\n\"Naked\" was voted the 24th best album of 1988 in \"The Village Voice\"s annual Pazz & Jop poll of American critics nationwide. Robert Christgau, the poll's supervisor, regarded it as \"an honest if less than sustaining internationalist gesture\" and said \"Byrne concealed the ricketiness of his current compositional practice by riding in on soukous's jetstream, but the trick didn't stick\", attributing the band's diminished success to a weariness with the music business. In \"\" (1990), he wrote, \"where Paul Simon appropriated African musicians, David Byrne just hires them, for better and worse – this is T. Heads funk heavy on the horns, which aren't fussy or obtrusive because Byrne knew where to get fresh ones. What's African about it from an American perspective is that the words don't matter – it signifies sonically.\" However, he called, \"(Nothing But) Flowers\" a \"gibe at ecology fetishism that's very reassuring\". Years later, he revised his stance on both \"Naked\" and \"True Stories\", \"which I once thought overrated. I was wrong. They sucked.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review, Michael Hastings from AllMusic found \"Naked\" \"alternately serious and playful\", allowing Byrne to continue worrying about \"the government, the environment, and the plight of the working man as it frees up the rest of the band to trade instruments and work with guest musicians. It's closest in spirit to \"Remain in Light\" – arguably too close.\" He further stated that \"the album sounds technically perfect, but there's little of the loose, live feel the band achieved with former mentor Brian Eno. It's quite a feat to pull off a late-career album as ambitious as \"Naked\", and the Heads do so with style and vitality.\" He concluded that \"the album's elegiac, airtight tone betrays the sound of four musicians growing tired of the limits they've imposed on one another.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it \"marked a return to their worldbeat explorations, although it sometimes suffered from Byrne's lyrical pretensions.\"\n\nNotes\n"}

Dubbed by TBS as a \"first of its kind broadband gaming network\", the service provided users with classic arcade video games and game-related video content. The service was acquired by French online video game service Metaboli in 2008 as a wholly owned subsidiary aiming to create a global games service.\n\nGameTap was conceived primarily as an online subscription rental service, competing against mail-based services like GameFly. GameTap offered two subscription levels: a Premium subscription with access to the entire content library, and a Classic subscription with access to older console and arcade games running in emulation. GameTap also sold games via the online distribution method. GameTap initially offered a limited selection of games for free play without a subscription, but this option has been discontinued.\n\nOriginally, GameTap was designed to offer not only video games, but a complete media hub (GameTap TV), taking advantage of the TBS catalog as well as offering original video content, including the animated series \"\" and new episodes of \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\". GameTap TV has since been discontinued.\n\nMost multiplayer games can be played by two users on the same computer while many others not originally intended to be played outside of a LAN may be played over the internet by using a VPN client such as Hamachi. A limited number of games have been enhanced with an online leaderboard and challenge lobby, adding internet multiplayer to games that previously could only be played face to face. Every Monday GameTap holds a leaderboard tournament with a different game each week.\n\nGameTap has funded the development of a number of titles, with the games subsequently premiering as GameTap exclusives. Such games include \"Sam & Max Season One\" and \"\".\n\nOn February 7, 2007, GameTap announced their third original game, \"\", from independent developer 3000AD. The four-part episodic game is a space combat title formerly planned for launch in the Summer of 2007. However, it suffered from constant delays, and in early 2008, GameTap announced that it had canceled its deal with 3000AD. \"It was a good game, it was very solid, but as we were going through, it ended up not being the right title for our audience,\" says Ricardo Sanchez. \"It was a tough call. I think it’s one of the strongest games [Derek] ever made. We put a lot of effort into it...I honestly think it's one of Derek’s strongest games.\"\n\nOn May 15, 2007, \"PC Gamer\" magazine premiered the first look at GameTap's newest original game, \"American McGee's Grimm\", a 24 part episodic series by game designer American McGee.\n\nGameTap launched on October 17, 2005 with over 300 games and had grown to over 1,000. The service was the idea of Turner employee Blake Lewin. The initial list of game licensees included Activision, Atari, Intellivision Lives!, Midway, Namco, Sega, and Taito. After its inception, more companies licensed their software, including: Eidos Interactive, G-Mode, Ubisoft, Codemasters, Vivendi Games, Konami, Electronic Arts, Capcom, Take-Two Interactive, Interplay and SNK Playmore.\n\nOn 1 May 2007, GameTap revised its business model to utilize three different service levels: Visitor, Green, and Gold. The Visitor and Green levels were free, had access to a limited selection of games, and were supported by advertising. Green members registered with the site and received access to a few more games. Gold members were essentially identical to paid subscribers as before.\n\nOn November 29, 2007, GameTap announced that as of December 11, over 70 games would be removed from their catalog, many of them Electronic Arts or Interplay titles, likely due to expiration of the two-year licensing agreement with those companies.\n\nOn January 10, 2008 a GameTap staff member announced the return of the Humongous Games license which restored popular games such as the likes of \"Putt Putt\" and \"Pajama Sam\" back to the library.\n\nOn August 6, 2008, Turner Broadcasting announced they were looking to sell GameTap. On September 24, 2008, Time Warner sold the service to Paris-based Metaboli. Turner continued to handle GameTap's operations during the transition period, which lasted until 2009. After the transition, the service became available to non-US/Canadian residents.\n\nOn March 31, 2009, GameTap Player was replaced by the plug-in after saying goodbyes to their players, GameTap's business model was again changed - into a GameTap Plug-In; the service was then handled through the website. The subscription levels were changed to Free Pack (selected handful of games for free), a new Classic Pack (reduced-price version of the full service which does not include Windows games), and Premium Pack (the Gold membership). However, due to technical issues, many features offered previously were disabled during the migration. Users with 64-bit versions of Windows could only play games that are marked as 64-bit compatible. GameTap was working on encrypting the rest of their Windows catalog with Yummy encryption to make them 64-bit compatible.\n\nOn October 14, 2010, the American office of Metaboli was shut down and all operations moved to Paris, thus cutting all ties with original Turner employees.\n\nGameTap was criticized for its cancellation process, which required customers to contact live support personnel; such calls were noted by reviewers to be deliberately protracted by support staff in an effort to retain subscribers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2145965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145965", "title": "Sheikhupura", "text": "Sheikhupura\n\nShekhupura also known as Qila Sheikhupura (, ) is a city in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Founded by the Mughal Emperor Jehangir in 1607, Sheikhupura is the 16th largest city in Pakistan, and is the headquarters of Sheikhupura District. Sheikhupura is also the headquarters of Sheikhupura Division. The city is an industrial center, and satellite town, located about 38 km northwest of Lahore.\n\nThe region around Sheikhupura was previous known as \"Virk Garh, or\" \"\"Virk\" Fort\", in reference to the Jat tribe that inhabited the area. The city, founded in 1607, was named by Mughal Emperor Jehangir himself - the city's first name is recorded in the Emperor's autobiography, the \"Tuzk-e-Jahangiri,\" in which he refers to the town as \"Jehangirabad.\" The city then came to be known by its current name, which derives from Jehangir's nickname \"Shekhu\" that was given to him by his mother, wife of Akbar the Great.\n\nMughal Emperor Jahangir laid the foundations of Sheikhupura in 1607 near the older town of Jandiala Sher Khan, an important provincial town during the early to middle Mughal era. He also erected the nearby Hiran Minar, Sheikhpura's most renowned site, between 1607 and 1620 as a monument to his beloved pet deer, \"Mansiraj\", at a time when the area served as a royal hunting ground for the Mughal Emperor. Jehangir laid the foundation of the Sheikhupura Fort in 1607, which is situated in the city's centre.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Mughal authority, the city came under the control of the Bhatti tribe. The tribe struggled to maintain control of the area, as bandits and Sikhs began encroaching upon the area. In 1797, the Durrani king Shah Zaman briefly seized the city and fortress during his campaign to capture Lahore. The city's fort then was captured by the Sikh bandit, Inder Singh. \n\nSheikhupura was then captured from the Bhattis by the forces of Lehna Singh in 1799. Sheikhupura thus came under the rule of the Sikh Sukherchakia \"Misl\" state under Lehna Singh's ally, Ranjit Singh, forcing the Bhatti tribe to retreat to Pindi Bhattian and Jalalpur. Sheikhupura then changed hands several more times, before finally being captured by Ranjit Singh in 1808.\n\nSheikhupura remained under suzerainty of the Sikh Empire until 1847, when the British seized control of the area. The British imprisoned the last Queen of the Sikh Empire, Maharani Jind Kaur, at the Sheikhpura Fort for ten months until 1848 before ultimately condemning her to exile abroad.\n\nFollowing establishment of British colonial rule, Bhatti possessions that had been seized by the Sikhs were restored. The large area between the Chenab and Ravi rivers were initially consolidated into a single district with Sheikhupura serving as its first headquarters, until 1851. The area around Sheikhupura attained District status in 1919, with M.M.L. Karry serving as its first administrator.\n\nOn the eve of the Partition of British India, Sikhs made up 19% of the district's population. Despite the area's Muslim majority, Sikhs had hoped that the boundary commission would award the area to India, given the proximity of Sheikhupura to the city of Nankana Sahib - revered as the birthplace of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak. The city was spared the large-scale rioting that engulfed Lahore earlier in 1947, and the city's Sikh population did not shift to India before the Radcliffe Line that demarcated the border of the newly independent states of Pakistan and India was announced. \n\nThe Sikh population had not made arrangements to leave and remained trapped in the city until 31 August 1947. The city's Sacha Sauda refugee camp hosted upwards of 100,000 Sikh refugees who had come to the city after fleeing nearby Gujranwala and other surrounding areas earlier that year. Fierce violence erupted in the city, and an estimated 10,000 people were killed in Sheikhupura between 16 August and 31 August in communal rioting between Sikhs and Muslims. Large numbers of Sikh women were killed by Sikh men in an attempt to prevent Muslim rioters from reaching them.\n\nThe overall literacy rate of Sheikhupura is 43.6% which is increasing day by day. Following are some of the notable educational institutes of the city:\n\nAccording to the 1998 Pakistan Census, the population of Sheikhupura city was recorded as 280,263. As per 2017 Census of Pakistan, the population of city was recorded as 473,129 with an increase of 68.82% in just 19 years.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2145967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145967", "title": "Window shutter", "text": "Window shutter\n\nA window shutter is a solid and stable window covering usually consisting of a frame of vertical stiles and horizontal rails (top, centre and bottom). Set within this frame can be louvers (both operable or fixed, horizontal or vertical), solid panels, fabric, glass and almost any other item that can be mounted within a frame.\nShutters may be employed for a variety of reasons, including controlling the amount of sunlight that enters a room, to provide privacy, security, to protect against weather or unwanted intrusion or damage and to enhance the aesthetics of a building.\n\nDepending on the application, and the construction of the window frame, shutters can be mounted to fit within the opening or to overlap the opening. The term window shutter includes both interior shutters, used on the inside of a house or building, and exterior shutters, used on the outside of a structure. On some styles of buildings it is common to have shutters to cover the doors as well as the windows.\n\nInterior shutters are typically divided into narrow units hinged accordion-style so that two or more units cover each side of a window opening when closed. Operable louvered shutters have louvers (or louvres in British usage), or slats, controlled by a tilt bar or rod to adjust the louver position and keep them in a uniform position, to control light, visibility and airflow. Shutters with operable louvers are described variously as traditional shutters, California shutters, or plantation shutters. Plantation shutters, typical of warmer climates like Florida, South Africa, the Mediterranean or Australia, typically have only two shutters per window and wide louver blades.\n\nOther interior shutters use stationary louvers that do not rotate (fixed louvers); solid raised or flat panels; fabric inserts; or tinted glass. Shutters can be configured in a single tier unit that has one shutter top to bottom of a window opening as well as multiple tiers. Multiple tier units feature separate shutters on each tier which allows the top shutters to be opened independently from the bottom shutters. Café-type shutters refer to shutters that only cover the lower portion of a window.\n\nFull height shutters can be made with a horizontal divider rail which separates the upper and lower portions of the shutter. With operable louvered shutters this gives greater control as the louvers above the divider rail can be operated independently from the louvers below the divider rail. Interior shutters can be constructed from numerous woods, which can be painted or stained, and a variety of synthetic materials. Interior shutters that are made to close tolerances are preferable for the best possible fit. When louvers or tilt bar (rod) become damaged, replacement kits for these damaged parts may be ordered online and are easy to install.\n\nIn the UK, most interior shutters historically were paneled.\n\nExterior shutters were originally constructed for light control, privacy, security and protection from the elements. Functional shutters hinge on each side of a window or at the top and swing closed when necessary and can also be mounted on tracks applied to the face of the building. Fixed and operable louvers shed rain, allow air transfer, filter direct sunlight, protect from small flying debris, and provide privacy. Operable louvered shutters allow for greater control of light and ventilation. Solid panels and board-and-batten shutters are generally used for security or protection during severe weather. Non-functional shutters are merely used to enhance the appearance of a building. Functional shutters have traditionally been constructed from solid woods that have proven to endure outside elements but have also been mass-produced in woods less suitable to the outdoors like pine. Finishing wood shutters is recommended for extended life. Composite shutters offer advantages over wood shutters such as resistance to twisting, splitting, and rotting. However, PVC shutters are often hinged with three or more hinges and painted with vinyl-safe paint to keep from bowing in the sun and can require additional hardware. Fiberglass shutters are more dimensionally stable than PVC.\n\nCertain hardwoods currently used for exterior shutters, specifically Spanish cedar, Honduran mahogany and teak, are resistant to rot and decay, and far more durable than a softer wood like untreated pine. Because of the tannin in these woods they are also not prone to problems from insects. Pressure treatment with wood preservative makes pine, cedar and other types of wood suitable for exterior shutters. Non-functional exterior shutters can be constructed from wood, vinyl, fiberglass or other synthetic materials. Non-functional shutters can be simply screwed or bolted directly to the building, with spacers or other hardware to prevent water accumulating against the wall. Fiberglass, a material widely used for boat hulls, is not prone to rotting or twisting, is dimensionally stable and has low expansion and contraction. It is a reinforced plastic, unlike vinyl or PVC, so fiberglass shutters do not have a tendency to warp or sag. Its strength is comparable to aluminum; however, it does not suffer from corrosion and electrolysis.\n\nExterior shutters in France, notably in Paris, are frequently made of steel and are configured in multiple narrow full-length panels, allowing them to fold open and fit inconspicuously against the recesses at the sides of the window. Some exterior shutters in Italy, such as in towns along the Adriatic coast, slide on rollers into pockets in the wall at each side of the window.\n\nIn Germany and other parts of Europe, rolling exterior shutters on tracks have become ubiquitous, although they lack the decorative value of traditional shutters. When open, these type shutters roll up into boxes concealed in the thickness of the wall above the window. They are typically raised and lowered manually, such as by a rolling pull made of flat nylon cord, but they can be equipped with electric operating mechanisms. These shutters allow some light in the room when not fully lowered, but wholly block light when completely closed. Variations include frame extensions that allow the closed shutter to swing out like an awning or Bermuda shutter.\n\nAn exterior hurricane shutter or storm shutter is used to protect windows and doors in a building against the effects of high winds, rain, and flying objects during a hurricane, or as a security shutter over an opening. They can be made of a variety of materials such as fiberglass, steel, aluminum, wood or composite wood and can be installed in tracks to be quickly opened and closed manually or with motorized controls. The track-mounted storm shutters in America are of German design and are frequently of German manufacture. The walls of American houses are typically too thin to conceal the boxes that hold the shutters when open, so the boxes are visible on the exterior above the windows. There are also high-impact-resistant plastics that can be applied to new or existing wood shutters that provide hurricane protection.\n\n"}

This mysterious figure is Zero, the ultimate leader of the Dark Matter Army.\n\nIf the player has collected all the stars, the player proceeds to fight Dedede as normal. However, Dark Matter then emerges and flies into the atmosphere, with Kirby in hot pursuit, armed with a weapon called the Love-Love Stick, assembled from all the Heart Stars he collected during his journey. After a climactic battle with Dark Matter, Zero himself emerges, leading to a long and difficult battle. After Zero is defeated, peace is finally restored to the universe.\n\nThe game's platforming mechanics are very similar to most other Kirby games, as is Kirby's skillset. Kirby is able to jump, duck, slide, fly (by inflating himself), as well as perform his signature move: inhaling enemies. When Kirby inhales an enemy, it can be spit back out as a projectile, or swallowed. Normally this has no effect on Kirby, although specific enemies grant Kirby \"copy abilities\", a staple of the Kirby games. Copy abilities replace Kirby's standard inhaling move with a special attack, depending on the enemy Kirby ate. For example, swallowing a fire-based enemy allows Kirby to become a fireball.\n\nZero is the game's secret and true final boss; defeating him is key in achieving the best ending. Zero takes the form of a giant eye with a red iris, and is responsible for leading the Dark Matter invasion of Dreamland. Zero is famous for being a rare example of graphic violence in a first-party Nintendo game – Zero fights Kirby by opening cuts on his sclera and shooting blood out of the cuts at him, as well as summoning small Dark Matters to use as projectiles. When his health is drastically weakened, his iris rips out from the rest of his body, with blood flying everywhere as it does so. The ruined body, complete with a vicious gash to its front from where the eye burst out trails away, and the final phase of the fight begins, which involves Zero ramming Kirby to injure him. Although he is eventually defeated, Zero reappears in Kirby 64 as '0' (pronounced zero two), retaining his ability to spit blood and his motif as a giant eye. As a reference to his previous fight with Kirby, 0 wears two large plasters on the top of his 'head', covering the wound left from his iris bursting out of his body.\n\nAt any time during play, Kirby can summon Gooey—a blue, long-tongued blob first seen in \"Dream Land 2\". Doing so costs Kirby two hit points. When controlled by the computer or also a second human player, Gooey's abilities are similar to Kirby's: He can swallow enemies using his long tongue, then either spit them out or copy their abilities to a limited extent. Gooey's tongue is also capable of obtaining items similarly to Kirby's inhale, though it is also capable of grabbing stars, which Kirby would need to touch in order to obtain. Kirby can also inhale Gooey and swallow him, reclaiming his two hit points.\n\nIn addition to Gooey, Kirby can team up with any one of his six other Animal Friends, three of which were introduced in the previous game in the series. This friend mechanic allows Kirby to be ridden, carried or rolled, enabling new team-based abilities, as well as variations of Kirby's copy abilities. The friends Kirby can team up with are:\n\nNumerous puzzles in the game make use of the Animal Friends' different gameplay styles, and usually require the player to master them in order to be completed. For example, one mission that has Kirby escort Rick to the end of the level features numerous high walls to scale and large gaps bridged by enemies to stomp on, and another mission makes Kirby use the Clean ability with Pitch to water some flowers. In many other cases, however, the Animal Friends serve as a supplement to the gameplay with the purpose of aiding the player. Additionally, each world features one Heart Star mission requiring that Kirby escort an Animal Friend to an acquaintance of theirs at the end of the level.\n\n\"Kirby's Dream Land 3\" uses a mode of the SNES termed \"pseudo high-resolution\" (which allows for color blending between two adjacent pixels) to blend dithered sprites.\n\nThe cartridge also takes advantage of SA-1 technology to process game data at a faster rate, which was necessary for the large number of bitmaps and special effects used by faster releases.\n\n\"Kirby's Dream Land 3\" received mixed to positive reception from both critics and fans. IGN gave \"Dream Land 3\" a fairly positive review of the Virtual Console re-release, \"It's not \"Super Star\". But once you get past that, you can appreciate \"Dream Land 3\" for what it is -- a direct, numbered follow-up to the series that started on the Game Boy.\" Nintendo Life initially gave the game a 6 out of 10, criticizing the lack of difficulty but praising the stylized graphics. However, a different reviewer for the same website gave the Virtual Console re-release a 7 out of 10, calling \"Dream Land 3\" a \"lovable gaming experience\" and a \"worthy sequel.\"\n\n"}

One of the most famous painters of his time, he is regarded a main protagonist of the Wilhelmine Period.\n\nWerner was born in Frankfurt (Oder) in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg, the son of a carpenter. His family originally came from East Prussia and was ennobled (\"von\") in 1701. He began an apprenticeship as a decorative painter in 1857 and from 1860 onwards studied painting at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. One year later, he pursued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe, where he studied with Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, Ludwig des Coudres, Adolf Schroedter, and Karl Friedrich Lessing.\n\nIn Karlsruhe, Werner met with artists like Eduard Devrient, Johannes Brahms and Clara Schumann, Paul Heyse, and the Norwegian painter Hans Gude. The author Joseph Victor von Scheffel, who became a close friend, introduced him to Grand Duke Frederick I of Baden, and Werner illustrated several printed editions of Scheffel's works. Werner visited Paris in 1865 and again from March 1867 to July 1868, preparing the International Exposition of 1867. He was strongly influenced by the history paintings of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Eugène Delacroix, Ernest Meissonier, and Léon Cogniet whom he also met personally. Having obtained a travelling scholarship upon the exhibition of his early works at the International Exposition, he moved to Italy in 1868 and stayed with Anselm Feuerbach in Rome until November 1869. On his return to Baden, he received several state commissions.\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Werner was sent with the staff of the 3rd \"Corps d'Armée\" under the command of Prince Frederick William of Prussia in October 1870. In January 1871, he was summoned to the Prussian headquarters in Versailles and commissioned to immortalize the proclamation of the German Empire at the Hall of Mirrors. This painting marked Werner's final breakthrough, he became acquainted with numerous German federal princes he portrayed, met with Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke, as well as with Emperor Wilhelm I. Afterwards he returned to Berlin, now the German capital, and married Malwine Schroedter, daughter of his tutor Adolf Schroedter in August 1871.\n\nIn Berlin, Werner designed a large velarium stretching over the Unter den Linden boulevard at the triumphant arrival of the victorious German troops. He received further public commissions to create the mural decorations in the portico of the Victory Column, whereby he used his velarium as a cartoon for an innovative stained glass mosaic. He continued to commemorate the Franco-Prussian War in several commissioned paintings.\n\nIn 1873 Werner was appointed professor at the Berlin Academy. His career reached its peak when he became, in 1875, director of the Academy. After 1888, while in William II's court, Werner tutored the emperor to become a painter. In 1909, he succeeded Hugo von Tschudi in directing the Nationalgalerie in Berlin. He died in Berlin in 1915 and was interred at the \"Alter Zwölf-Apostel-Kirchhof\" in the Schöneberg neighborhood of Berlin.\n\nWerner's more important works include \"The Capitulation of Sedan\", \"Proclamation of the German Empire at Versailles\", \"Moltke before Paris\", \"Moltke at Versailles\", \"The Meeting of Bismarck and Napoleon III\", \"Christ and the Tribute Money\", \"William I visiting the Tombs\", \"The Congress of Berlin\", and some decorations executed in mosaic for the Berlin Victory Column.\nWerner's work is chiefly interesting for the historic value of his pictures of the events of the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nWerner was good friends with Norwegian painter Hans Gude whom he met at the Karlsruhe school, and whom he would later work with at the Berlin Academy. Gude wrote of Werner in 1873,\n\nOne of his students at the Prussian Academy of Arts was Emil Fuchs; another was August von Brandis.\n"}

It is an improvement of the earlier exploding-bridgewire detonator; instead of directly coupling the shock wave from the exploding wire, the expanding plasma from an explosion of a metal foil drives another thin plastic or metal foil called a \"flyer\" or a \"slapper\" across a gap, and its high-velocity impact on the explosive (for example, PETN or hexanitrostilbene) then delivers the energy and shock needed to initiate a detonation. Normally all the slapper's kinetic energy is supplied only by the heating (and hence expansion) of the plasma (the former foil) by the current passing through it, though constructions with a \"back strap\" to further drive the plasma forward by magnetic field exist too. This assembly is quite efficient; up to 30% of the electrical energy can be converted to the slapper's kinetic energy.\n\nThe initial explosion is usually caused by explosive vaporization of a thin metal wire or strip, by driving several thousand amperes of electric current through it, usually from a capacitor charged to several thousand volts. The switching may be done by a spark gap or a krytron.\n\nUsually the construction consists of an explosive booster pellet, against which a disk with a hole in the center is set. Over the other side of the disk, there is a layer of an insulating film, for example, Kapton or PET film, with a thin strip of metal (typically aluminum or gold) foil deposited on its outer side. A narrowed section of the metal then explosively vaporizes when a current pulse passes through it, which shears the mylar foil and the plasma ball pushes it through the hole, accelerating it to very high speed. The impact then detonates the explosive pellet.\nAdvantages over explosive-bridgewire detonators include:\n\nIn a variant called laser detonator the vaporization can be caused by a high-power laser pulse delivered over-the-air or coupled by an optical fiber; this is reportedly used as a safety detonator in some mining operations and quarries. Typically a 1-watt solid-state laser is used.\n\nThe slapper detonators are frequently used in modern weapon designs and aerospace technology.\n\nFor the description of the required firing system, see Firing system for exploding-bridgewire detonator.\n\n\n\nCooper, Paul W., \"Explosives Engineering\", New York: Wiley-VCH, 1996. \n"}

{"id": "2145981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145981", "title": "Shutter (photography)", "text": "Shutter (photography)\n\nIn photography, a shutter is a device that allows light to pass for a determined period, exposing photographic film or a photosensitive digital sensor to light in order to capture a permanent image of a scene. A shutter can also be used to allow pulses of light to pass outwards, as seen in a movie projector or a signal lamp. A shutter of variable speed is used to control exposure time of the film. The shutter is constructed so that it automatically closes after a certain required time interval. The speed of the shutter is controlled by a ring outside the camera, on which various timings are marked.\n\nCamera shutters can be fitted in several positions:\n\n\nBehind-the-lens shutters were used in some cameras with limited lens interchangeability. Shutters in front of the lens, sometimes simply a lens cap that is removed and replaced for the long exposures required, were used in the early days of photography. Other mechanisms than the dilating aperture and the sliding curtains have been used; anything which exposes the film to light for a specified time will suffice.\n\nThe time for which a shutter remains open (exposure time, often called \"shutter speed\") is determined by a timing mechanism. These were originally pneumatic (Compound shutter) or clockwork, but since the late twentieth century are mostly electronic. Mechanical shutters typically had a Time setting, where the shutter opened when the button was pressed and remained open until it was pressed again, Bulb where the shutter remained open as long as the button was pressed (originally actuated by squeezing an actual rubber bulb), and Instantaneous exposure, with settings ranging from 30\" to 1/4000\" for the best leaf shutters, faster for focal-plane shutters, and more restricted for basic types. The reciprocal of exposure time in seconds is often used for engraving shutter settings. For example, a marking of \"250\" denotes 1/250\". This does not cause confusion in practice.\n\nThe exposure time and the effective aperture of the lens must together be such as to allow the right amount of light to reach the film or sensor. Additionally, the exposure time must be suitable to handle any motion of the subject. Usually it must be fast enough to \"freeze\" rapid motion, unless a controlled degree of motion blur is desired, for example to give a sensation of movement.\n\nMost shutters have a flash synchronization switch to trigger a flash, if connected. This was quite a complicated matter with mechanical shutters and flashbulbs which took an appreciable time to reach full brightness, focal-plane shutters making this even more difficult. Special flashbulbs were designed which had a prolonged burn, illuminating the scene for the whole time taken by a focal plane shutter slit to move across the film. These problems were essentially solved for non-focal-plane shutters with the advent of electronic flash units which fire virtually instantaneously and emit a very short flash.\n\nWhen using a focal-plane shutter with a flash, if the shutter is set at its X-sync speed or slower the whole frame will be exposed when the flash fires (otherwise only a band of the film will be exposed).\nSome electronic flashes can produce a longer pulse compatible with a focal-plane shutter operated at much higher shutter speeds. The focal-plane shutter will still impart focal-plane shutter distortions to a rapidly moving subject.\n\nCinematography uses a rotary disc shutter in movie cameras, a continuously spinning disc which conceals the image with a reflex mirror during the intermittent motion between frame exposure. The disc then spins to an open section that exposes the next frame of film while it is held by the registration pin.\n\nA focal-plane shutter is positioned just in front of the film, in the focal plane, and moves an aperture across the film until the full frame has been exposed.\nFocal-plane shutters are usually implemented as a pair of light-tight cloth, metal, or plastic curtains. For shutter speeds slower than a certain point (known as the X-sync speed of the shutter), which depends on the camera, one curtain of the shutter opens, and the other closes after the correct exposure time. At shutter speeds faster than the X-sync speed, the top curtain of the shutter travels across the focal plane, with the second curtain following behind, effectively moving a slit across the focal plane until each part of the film or sensor has been exposed for the correct time. The effective exposure time can be much shorter than for central shutters, at the cost of some distortion of fast-moving subjects.\n\nFocal plane shutters have the advantage over central leaf shutters of allowing the use of interchangeable lenses without requiring a separate shutter for each lens. (Leaf shutters behind the lens also allow interchanging the lens using a single shutter.)\n\nThey have several disadvantages as well:\n\n\nA \"simple leaf shutter\" is a type of camera shutter consisting of a mechanism with one or more pivoting metal leaves which normally does not allow light through the lens onto the film, but which when triggered opens the shutter by moving the leaves to uncover the lens for the required time to make an exposure, then shuts.\n\nSimple leaf shutters have a single leaf, or two leaves, which pivot so as to allow light through to the lens when triggered. If two leaves are used they have curved edges to create a roughly circular aperture. They typically have only one shutter speed and are commonly found in basic cameras, including disposable cameras. Some have more than one speed. Shutters for newer digital cameras are a combination of electronic and mechanical timings. Some cameras employ a 100% electronic shutter, created by turning on and off the imaging sensor's signals. Digital cameras that can also take video implement this method for their video modes. For single-frame photography then either mechanical or mechanical and electronic methods are used.\n\nThe shutter plate consisted of a part of a sphere integrated to rotate behind the lens. It was a type of shutter found on the Photosphere and other cameras.\n\nA \"diaphragm\" or \"leaf\" shutter (as distinct from the simple leaf shutter above) consists of a number of thin blades which briefly uncover the camera aperture to make the exposure. The blades slide over each other in a way which creates a circular aperture which enlarges as quickly as possible to uncover the whole lens, stays open for the required time, then closes in the same way. The larger the number of blades, the more accurately circular is the aperture. Flash synchronization is easily achieved with a pair of contacts that close when the shutter is fully open.\n\nIdeally the shutter opens instantaneously, remains open as long as required, and closes instantaneously. This is essentially the case at slower speeds, but as speeds approach their maximum the shutter is far from fully open for a significant part of the exposure time. Effectively the shutter acts as an additional aperture, and may, for example, cause vignetting or increase depth of field, undesirable if shallow focus is being used creatively.\n\nThe term \"diaphragm shutter\" has also been used to describe an optical stop with a slit, near the focal plane of a moving-film high-speed camera.\n\nA few types and makers of leaf shutters became very well known. The early Compound shutter had a pneumatic mechanism, with a piston sliding against air resistance in a cylinder. They were quieter at slow speeds than clockwork, but potentially very inaccurate. More accurate clockwork mechanisms then replaced the airbrake, and the German Compur, and the later Synchro-Compur, became virtually the standard quality shutter. Later the Japanese Copal shutter was widely adopted in quality equipment. The German Prontor and Japanese Seikosha shutters were also widely used. \"Up and Down with Compur: The development and photo-historical meaning of leaf shutters\", by Klaus-Eckard Riess, translated by Robert \"The Professor\" Stoddard gives a detailed history and technical description of leaf shutters. The company Compur Monitor was still in business , but made only gas detection systems.\n\nA \"central shutter\" is not a type of shutter as such, but describes the position of the shutter: it is typically a leaf shutter (or simple leaf shutter), and located within the lens assembly where a relatively small opening allows light to cover the entire image. Leaf shutters can also be located behind, but near, the lens, allowing lens interchangeability. The alternative to a central or behind-the-lens shutter is a focal-plane shutter.\n\nInterchangeable-lens cameras with a central shutter within the lens body require that each lens has a shutter built into it. In practice most cameras with interchangeable lenses use a single focal plane shutter in the camera body for all lenses, while cameras with a fixed lens use a central shutter. Many medium-format and most large-format cameras, however, have interchangeable lenses each fitted with a central shutter. A few interchangeable-lens cameras have a behind-the-lens leaf shutter. Large-format press cameras often had a focal-plane shutter. Some had both a focal-plane shutter (for lens interchangeability) and a lens with central shutter (for flash synchronisation); one shutter would be locked open.\n\nFilm cameras, but not digital cameras, with a central shutter and interchangeable lenses often have a secondary shutter or darkslide to cover the film and allow changing lens in mid-roll without fogging the film.\n\nThe main advantages of central and behind-the-lens leaf shutters compared to a focal-plane shutter are:\n\nSome disadvantages of the central shutter are:\n\nDigital image sensors (both CMOS and CCD image sensors) can be constructed to give a shutter equivalent function by transferring many pixel cell charges at one time to a paired shaded double called frame transfer shutter. If the full-frame is transferred at one time, it is a global shutter. Often the shaded cells can independently be read, while the others are again collecting light. Extremely fast shutter operation is possible as there are no moving parts or any serialized data transfers. Global shutter can also be used for videos as a replacement for rotary disc shutters.\n\nImage sensors without a shaded full-frame double must use serialized data transfer of illuminated pixels called rolling shutter. A rolling shutter scans the image in a line-by-line fashion, so that different lines are exposed at different instants, as in a mechanical focal-plane shutter, so that motion of either camera or subject will cause geometric distortions, such as skew or wobble.\n\nToday, most digital cameras use combination of mechanical shutter and electronic shutter or mechanical shutter solely. Mechanical shutter can accommodate up to 1/16000 seconds (for example the Minolta Dynax/Maxxum/α-9 film camera had a maximum of 1/12000, a record in its era, and the later digital Nikon D1 series were capable of 1/16000), while electronic shutter can accommodate at least 1/32000 seconds, used for many superzoom cameras and currently many Fujifilm APS-C cameras (X-Pro2, X-T1, X100T and others).\n\nShutter lag is the time between the shutter release being pressed and the exposure started. While this delay was insignificant on most film and some digital cameras, many digital cameras have significant delay, which can be a problem with fast-moving subjects as in sports and other action photography. Release lag of a bridge camera such as the 2010 Pentax X90 is a relatively short 1/50 s, or 21 milliseconds (ms). The Canon 50d dSLR is specified at 131 ms lag.\n\nIn many cases autofocus (AF) lag is the root cause of shutter lag. Lower-cost cameras and low-light or low-contrast situations will make the effect more pronounced and it is in these cases that AF lag is more noticed. Most AF systems use contrast to determine focus; in situations where contrast is low, the speed at which the camera can determine the best focus can be quite noticeable. Since most modern cameras will not activate the shutter until autofocus is complete, the result is shutter lag. In these cases, the photographer can switch to manual focus to avoid the delay that is attributable to the AF function.\n\nA shutter cycle is the process of the shutter opening, closing, and resetting to where it is ready to open again. The life-expectancy of a mechanical shutter is often expressed as a number of shutter cycles.\n\nIn movie projection, the shutter admits light from the lamphouse to illuminate the film across to the projection screen. To avoid flicker, a double-bladed rotary disc shutter admits light two times per frame of film. There are also some models which are triple-bladed, and thus admit light three times per frame (see Persistence of vision).\n\nShutters are also used simply to regulate pulses of light, with no film being used, as in a signal lamp.\n\n"}

He was arrested, later killed and cremated at the Dachau concentration camp.\n\nGerlich was born in Stettin, Pomerania, and grew up as the eldest of the three sons of wholesale and retail fishmonger Paul Gerlich and his wife Therese. In Autumn 1889, Gerlich was enrolled in the Marienstiftungymnasium (Our Lady's Grammar School) and graduated from his senior class there in 1901.\n\nIn 1902 he began his studies at the University of Munich, and first majored in mathematics and natural sciences before switching to history. At the university, he was an active member of the Free Student Union (or sometimes translated as Free Student Association from the German word \"Freistudentenschaft\"). He wrote his doctoral dissertation \"The Testament of Henry VI\" and completed it in 1907.\n\nOn 9 October 1920, he married Sophie Botzenhart, born Stempfle, in Munich.\n\nAfter completing his studies with a doctorate, Gerlich became an archivist.\n\nHe also began to contribute political articles that were anti-socialist and national-conservative in the publications \"Süddeutsche Monatshefte\", which was edited by Paul Nikolaus Cossmann, and \"Die Wirklichkeit\" (in 1917). In 1917, he also became active in the German Fatherland Party (Deutsche Vaterlandspartei) and after it was dissolved in the Anti-Bolshevist League (Antibolschewistische Liga) (1918/19).\n\nIn 1919, he published the book \"Communism as the Theory of the Thousand Year Reich\" (\"Der Kommunismus als Lehre vom Tausendjährigen Reich\"), where Gerlich compared communism with the phenomenon of redemption religion. A whole chapter in the work is devoted to denouncing antisemitism, which had gained ground because of the leading positions of many Jews in the Revolution and founding of the Soviet Union and Bavarian Soviet Republic.\n\nDuring those years, Gerlich's political views became more liberal. In 1920, he was nominated as candidate to the Bavarian Landtag and German Reichstag for the left-liberal German Democratic Party (Deutsche Demokratische Partei).\n\nFrom 1920 to 1928 he was editor in chief of the \"Münchner Neueste Nachrichten\" (MNN), a predecessor to today's \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" in that its circulation was one of the largest in southern Germany. As editor, Gerlich opposed Nazism and Hitler's Nazi Party as \"murderous\". In the early 1920s, he had seen proof of Nazi tyranny already in Munich. Once a conservative nationalist, after the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch Gerlich decisively turned against Hitler and became one of his fiercest critics. Other critics of the Nazis at MNN were later arrested within days of Gerlich, such as: Fritz Buechner, who followed Gerlich as the editor of the MNN, Erwein Freiherr von Aretin, who was domestic editor at the MNN, and Cossmann, who wrote for the MNN, all of whom had steered the MNN to support a return of the monarchy.\n\nBy 1927, he had befriended Therese Neumann, a Catholic mystic from Konnersreuth, Bavaria, who supported Gerlich's resistance activities. Initially, he wanted to expose her stigmatism as a fraud, but Gerlich came back a changed man and later converted from Calvinism to Catholicism in 1931. From that year until his death, his resistance became inspired by the social teachings of the Catholic Church.\n\nGerlich returned in November 1929 to his job at the Bavarian National Archives. A circle of friends that had developed around Neumann gave rise to the idea of founding a weekly political newspaper to dispute the left and right political extremism in Germany. Supported by a wealthy patron, Prince Waldburg-Zeil, Gerlich was able to take over the weekly newspaper \"Sunday Illustrated\" (\"Der Illustrierte Sonntag\"), which was renamed \"The Straight Path\" (\"Der Gerade Weg\") in 1932.\n\nIn this newspaper, Gerlich opposed Communism, National Socialism and antisemitism. The dispute with the growing Nazi movement became the central focus of Gerlich and his later writing. At the end of 1932 the circulation of the weekly was over 40,000 readers.\n\nGerlich once wrote \"National Socialism means: Enmity with neighbouring nations, tyranny internally, civil war, world war, lies, hatred, fratricide and boundless want.\"\n\nAfter the Nazis seized power on 30 January 1933, Gerlich was arrested March 9, 1933 and held at the Dachau concentration camp, where he died on 30 June 1934 during the Night of the Long Knives. His death was officially announced days after his arrest, and the announcement was published in the international press at the time.

He is known for playing high school freshman Sam Weir on the NBC comedy-drama \"Freaks and Geeks\" and FBI criminal profiler Dr. Lance Sweets on the crime drama series \"Bones\", for which he was nominated for a 2014 PRISM Award. He plays keyboards and sings for the band Dayplayer.\n\nIn cinema, Daley is known for his collaborative work with Jonathan Goldstein as a film-making duo. The pair have worked on various projects together. Daley and Goldstein's first work together was initially based in comedy where they were co-screenwriters for \"Horrible Bosses\" (2011), co-writers for \"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone\" (2013), co-story writers for \"Horrible Bosses 2\" (2014), and co-wrote/co-directed the fifth film in the \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" film series, \"Vacation\" (2015). The duo were co-story writers for \"\" (2017) with Jon Watts, Christopher Ford, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and they co-directed the 2018 comedy \"Game Night\".\n\nDaley was born in Wheeling, Illinois, to R.F. Daley, an actor, and Nancy Daley, a piano teacher. His father is of Irish Catholic background, while his mother is Jewish. He grew up in Nyack, New York, where he played Danny in Nyack Middle School's production of \"Grease.\"\n\nDaley began acting when he was cast as \"Young Tommy\" in the U.S. and international tours of the Broadway hit \"The Who's Tommy\". He played Sam Weir, protagonist of the \"Geeks\", in the television series \"Freaks and Geeks\", and since then he has worked continuously in television, including series such as \"The Geena Davis Show\", \"Boston Public\", \"Regular Joe\", \"Kitchen Confidential\", \"Judging Amy\", and \"Spin City\".

In 2007, Daley joined the cast of the Fox drama series \"Bones\", portraying psychologist Lance Sweets. He co-wrote the season six episode \"The Truth in the Myth\" with his writing partner Jonathan Goldstein. \"Bones\" executive producer Stephen Nathan said Sweets was killed because Daley wanted time off to direct a movie, and he was concerned that Daley's absence would be too long, especially if the directing job led to other jobs.\n\nDaley was also featured in the music video for \"Mercy Kiss\" by Abandoned Pools.\n\nIn 2011, Daley and his writing partner Jonathan M. Goldstein wrote the black comedy \"Horrible Bosses\". In 2013, Daley co-wrote \"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone\" with Goldstein; Daley also has a cameo in the film as a paramedic. In 2013, the two were hired to write \"Call of the Wild\" for DreamWorks Studios. John plays Ben House in \"Rapture-Palooza\". Daley went on to write the story for the sequel to \"Horrible Bosses\".\n\nDaley and Goldstein co-wrote and co-directed the 2015 film \"Vacation\", the latest installment of the \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" film series, starring Ed Helms and Christina Applegate.\n\nDaley and Goldstein wrote the screenplay for the 2017 film \"\" with four other screenwriters, and were both considered to direct before Jon Watts was hired.\n\nDaley and Goldstein directed the 2018 black comedy \"Game Night\", based on a screenplay by Mark Perez. The film, starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, \"earned a raft of glowing reviews for its whip-smart script, energetic performances, and deliberate avoidance of modern comedy's ubiquitous tropes,\" and grossed $117 million at the worldwide box office, versus a $37 million budget. While Daley and Goldstein did not receive screenwriter credit, they later said they rewrote \"almost all of the original script's dialogue, totally overhauled the characters — most notably a creepy cop portrayed by Jesse Plemons — and comprehensively reworked the original script's third act.\"\n\nIn 2018, it was announced that the duo were set to direct a film adaptation of DC Comics' \"Flashpoint\" for their DC Extended Universe, but it was announced in July that they have left the project.\n\nOn July 2019, it was announced that Goldstein and Daley were entering early negotiations to direct the reboot of Dungeons & Dragons (2022).

{"id": "2146000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146000", "title": "Thangata", "text": "Thangata\n\nThangata is a word deriving from the Chewa language of Malawi which has changed its meaning several times, although all meanings relate to agriculture. Its original, pre-colonial usage related to reciprocal help given in neighbours' fields or freely-given agricultural labour as thanks for a benefit. In colonial times, between 1891 and 1962, it generally meant agricultural labour given in lieu of a cash rent, and generally without any payment, by a tenant on an estate owned by a European. Thangata was often exploited, and tenants could be forced to work on the owners' crops for four to six months annually when they could have cultivated their own crops. From the 1920s, the name thangata was extended to situations where tenants were given seeds to grow set quotas of designated crops instead of providing cash or labour. Both forms of thangata were abolished in 1962, but both before and after independence and up to the present, the term has been used for short-term rural casual work, often on tobacco estates, which is considered by workers to be exploitative.\n\nThe term \"thangata\" has had several meanings in Malawi in the last 120 years, and its traditional or pre-colonial use was very different from its uses in colonial and modern times. The word exists in the Chewa and the related Mang'anja languages, and its first pre-colonial meaning was \"help\" or \"to assist\", in the sense of freely-given reciprocal help such as neighbours might give each other building huts or clearing fields. It also had the meaning of the agricultural work that a member of the village community did for his chief. The ownership of land in much of Malawi was vested in the community, not individuals. Traditional leaders acted as trustees over communal land, and granted the right to use it to individuals in their communities. By custom, these leaders received in gifts in kind or labour from those in their community who had benefited. This was also called thangata: although the term was first recorded with this meaning in 1921, the practice is believed to have existed for many centuries before then. When communal land was plentiful, community leaders could not demand thangata, but once it became scarcer in the colonial period, and particularly after the introduction of Indirect rule on 1933, the chiefs could impose a condition of thangata work on any grant. In the last two or three decades, chiefs have begun to require cash sums or rents to allow the use of communal land, but these cash payments are not called thangata.\n\nThe 1870s and 1880s in Malawi were unsettled, and local chiefs sought to gain European protection from their enemies by granting the settlers what they probably considered was only a right to cultivate vacant land. Soon after the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in 1891, these Europeans secured legal ownership of this land from the protectorate administration. The new owners also claimed all rights that the traditional leaders had or were thought to possess, asserting that thangata work was an obligation that the landlord could impose on tenants. In the early colonial period, thangata took on a new meaning of performing labour in lieu of rent. In the early years of the protectorate, the estates established in under-populated areas needed workers to establish plantations. Few Africans were resident on estate lands, and some of those who remained left when labour rents were introduced. New workers, who were often migrants from Mozambique, were encouraged to move onto estates and grow their own crops, but were required to pay rent and Hut tax, usually satisfied by two months' labour a year at this time.\n\nBefore 1905, relatively little land on the estates was planted, as the owners were experimenting with a variety of crops. However, from 1905, cotton was successfully grown in commercial quantities. Cotton has a 5 or 6 month growing season, throughout which it needs much labour, particularly for weeding and gathering, to achieve a successful result. Between 1910 and 1925, tobacco was also grown in plantations and, like cotton, it required a great deal of labour to grow successfully. As tenancies were based on verbal contracts, tenants had little or no chance to dispute the owners' interpretations of their conditions. On several estates, the obligations of labour tenants were extended, sometimes to a total of four or five months a year, for thangata labour rent and Hut tax. Much of this labour was demanded in the growing season, leaving tenants with little time to grow their own food. As the Crown lands near the estates were already crowded, and as most of estate tenants were migrants from Mozambique with no claim to communal land, they had little option but to remain. In this situation thangata came to mean forced labour.\n\nThe Nyasaland High Court in 1903 exempted the original inhabitants of estates from thangata and gave them some security. Legislation allowing other tenants to pay rent rather than thangata, and to receive cash wages if they performed more than the required thangata was enacted in 1908, but not implemented. Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, in December 1914, the Nyasaland government introduced a Nyasaland Defence Ordinance, requiring men to serve as porters in support of local armed forces. This service was equated with thangata, as those conscripted were forced to work on something that did not benefit them. The harshness of thangata, including the conscription of porters was at least one of the reasons underlying the 1915 uprising led by John Chilembwe. Following this revolt, a new attempt to abolish thangata in favour of cash rent was made, but it failed because of the political influence of the estate owners that opposed the measure. The thangata system was a bar to progress and impoverished people by limiting the amount of time they could work for themselves. There was no place for crafts or skills in thangata: ot reduced all tenants to unskilled manual labour, and was likened to a form of serfdom.\n\nEven after Chilembwe's revolt, the labour obligation on many estates was only slightly modified, sometimes amounting to six months for thangata and rent. When the Ormsby-Gore East African Commission visited Nyasaland in 1924, it was highly critical of the treatment of all Africans resident on private estates tenants supplying their labour, contrary to the exemption from thangata offered to those who were occupants when the original certificates of title certificates were granted. The commission suggested that, even though recent immigrants were not entitled to the same protection, they should be treated in the same way as the original residents and excused from thangata. However, local administrators were subject ti settler pressure and, although some abuses were curtailed, others such as equating a month of thangata to 30 days (or five weeks of six days' work), and requiring the wives of absent migrant workers, widows and single women to work in breach of custom, persisted. However, by 1918 most cotton, and by 1925 most tobacco, was not grown on estates by direct labour, but by smallholders on Crown lands. As the demand for estate labour declined in the 1920s, the owners claimed that, as they had insufficient work for their tenants to meet their thangata obligations, they had become rent-free squatters.\n\nSome smaller estates failed, but others were saved from collapse by a scheme first adopted by one large owner, The British Central Africa Company Ltd. Instead using of direct labour, it issued seeds to tenants so they could grow cotton and tobacco under supervision, and sell their crops to the planters at low prices. This system was formalised in legislation, the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, which modified thangata by allowing rents to be paid in cash, in a fixed quantity of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The true value of the crop, usually tobacco, given in lieu of rent greatly exceeded the nominal cash rent, and some landlords refused to accept cash when it was offered. Estate landlords also benefited from restrictions on smallholders growing tobacco on Crown lands, who might otherwise have competed with the estate tenants. Although the estates now largely acted as brokers for their tenants' produce, and the name thangata, sometimes \"tobacco thangata\" after its commonest form was applied to rent in kind, the older form of labour thangata persisted on tea estates, and elsewhere if the owner wished to grow crops through direct labour.\n\nIt was estimated that about 9% of Malawi's Africans lived on estates in 1911: in 1945, it was about 10%. In the latter year, the number of residents on estates was about 173,000 in 49,000 families. In the 1940s and early 1950s, there were tensions between estate owners and tenants over evictions and the tenants' wish to sell produce of their choice in local markets, not through the owner. The expansion of tea-planting led to a shortage of African labour, which became acute after 1945. The British Central Africa Company Ltd had formerly relied on labour tenants for most of its workforce, but in 1946 its local Manager complained that the company was unable to enforce unpopular thangata agreements or Sunday working although it had threatened many tenants with eviction. There was a further crisis in 1952–1953 when the British Central Africa Company tried to increase tenants' rents substantially, against the advice of the Nyasaland government. A number of tenants resisted the increase, and the company issued eviction notices to them. The tenants' resistance included clearing land for cultivation on the undeveloped parts of the company's estates and refusing to pay taxes or attend courts. Riots broke out in Cholo in August 1953, and attempts to quell rioting led to eleven dead and seventy-two injured. The tensions were lessened by government purchases of the land of former estates for resettlement, so by 1962, the number of estate residents had been reduced to 9,000 families. In 1962, the 1928 Ordinance was replaced by a 1962 Africans on Private Estates Ordinance that granted tenants security of tenure and abolished all forms of thangata requiring labour or the production of amounts if designated crops, replacing them with cash rents.\n\nAlthough tenants had produced tobacco on many estates in the Southern Region, by 1935, 70% of the national tobacco crop was grown in the Central Region, which had fewer freehold estates. At first, this tobacco was grown by Africans on Crown land, later on leasehold land where the leases of former Crown land had been granted to Europeans. These leaseholders engaged African sharecroppers under contract to grow one annual tobacco crop at a time, the \"visiting tenant\" system. The \"visiting tenant\" system had some similarities to estate tenancies in the Shire Highlands (called thangata, whether the rent was satisfied in labour or produce), but it was distinct, as the visiting tenants had permanent homes away from the places where they grew their crop. Like estate tenants, visiting tenants were underpaid for their crop because they were forced to sell it to the landowner. Although it was originally distinct from thangata, in 1963 shortly before independence, Hastings Banda, who was Minister of Agriculture, fiercely attacked the visiting tenant system and equated it to the hated thangata. Despite this rhetoric, when thangata was abolished in 1962, a temporary exemption was given for visiting tenants in the Central Region. However, using the term thangata to apply to the visiting tenant system for political purposes both extended its meaning to a situation to which it had not previously applied and made its meaning less clear.\n\nBy the late 1960s, politicians of the ruling Malawi Congress Party were involved in tobacco growing on the former European estates that the colonial government had bought, and which were sold or leased to the party elite after independence. Further elite-run estates were later created on what had previously been communal lands. By 1990, there were 675,000 registered estate tenants with little security, and another 580,000 \"squatters\" lived on surplus land with no security, who formed a pool of casual labour. Few tenants or squatters grew all their own food and most relied on casual paid labour or food-for-work arrangements on the estates to supplement what they could grow. The preferred term for short-term rural casual work paid for in cash or in kind (usually food) is ganyu. The term \"Ganyu\" is said to derive from the Portuguese \"ganho\" (sometimes spelled \"ganyao\") meaning something gained or a bonus. It originally denoted food or beer given as appreciation for neighbours when they worked on another's fields, then the work a poor person did for food or cash for more prosperous neighbour. Today tobacco estates are the largest employers of ganyu workers. These may stay for the growing season like visiting tenants, or travel in daily. Larger estates may pay the minimum cash wage; smaller estates usually only give food. These arrangements are sometimes called thangata, as in the 2007 documentary \"Thangata: social bondage and big tobacco in Malawi\".\n\nOf all the countries in Southern and Central Africa, Nyasaland was the most notorious for the duration of thangata and its importance to the colonial economy. Labour tenancy and sharecropping continued to exist in other less developed parts of Southern and Central Africa in the 20th century, but without the same social and political impact as in Nyasaland. In much of South Africa and Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, the growth of the money economy led rapidly to waged employment rather than labour in lieu of rent, and in North-Eastern Rhodesia estate agriculture was less dominant and land reasonably plentiful. In early Natal, the shortage of capital caused landowners to extract rent from African tenants in the forms of produce or labour, and this applied in Zululand until the early 20th century. However, in central Natal, employment for wages took over in the last third of the 19th century. African tenant farmers on European-owned estates in Matabeleland in the early colonial period could either pay rent or provide labour in lieu of rent, but after 1910, it was more usual for these estates to employ Africans for wages.\n\nThe system that is probably closest to thangata is the institution that was called ubureetwa in Rwanda. Although there were few European landowners, the traditional leaders who controlled access land were from the dominant Tutsi group. After the Europeans occupation, they were able to manipulate what had previously been freely-given labour into an unpaid agricultural labour obligation. As Rwanda had a mobile population, chiefs could allocate land to clients outside the community that had a traditional claim to use the land, in a clear parallel to the Mozambican migrants on Nyasaland estates. These Rwandan incomers were prepared to agree to accept a heavy burden of labour for access to land.The colonial administration in Rwanda gave a legal status to ubureetwa and, up to the 1950s, resisted abolishing it or commuting it to cash.\n\nIn the Congo Free State, forced labour, amounting to virtual slavery, was widely used by the government on public works and to compel Africans to gather ivory or wild rubber. Although forced labour in the Belgian Congo was abolished in theory in 1908, from 1917 the government a system of forced cultivation of cotton, coffee and rice began to be imposed on the peasant population, who were required to use their own land for one or more if these designated crops. On Belgian-owned estates, a Labour Code introduced in 1922 allowed employers to physically discipline their workers, so supposedly free labour was turned into a system of forced labour. However, neither the peasants nor estate workers were tenants, so the system was rather different from thangata.\n"}

{"id": "2146034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146034", "title": "CRISPR", "text": "CRISPR\n\nCRISPR () (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the prokaryote. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes.\n\nCas9 (or \"CRISPR-associated protein 9\") is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms. This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of biotechnology products, and treatment of diseases.\nThe CRISPR-Cas system is a prokaryotic immune system that confers resistance to foreign genetic elements such as those present within plasmids and phages that provides a form of acquired immunity. RNA harboring the spacer sequence helps Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins recognize and cut foreign pathogenic DNA. Other RNA-guided Cas proteins cut foreign RNA. CRISPR are found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.\n\nThe discovery of clustered DNA repeats occurred independently in three parts of the world. The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from Osaka University researcher Yoshizumi Ishino and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR sequence together with the \"\"iap\" gene\" \"(isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase)\" that was their target. The organization of the repeats was unusual. Repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively, without interspersed different sequences. They did not know the function of the interrupted clustered repeats.\n\nIn 1993, researchers of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted direct repeats (DR) in that bacterium. They recognized the diversity of the sequences that intervened the direct repeats among different strains of \"M. tuberculosis\" and used this property to design a typing method that was named \"spoligotyping\", which is still in use today.\n\nAt the same time, repeats were observed in the archaeal organisms of \"Haloferax\" and \"Haloarcula\" species, and their function was studied by Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain. Although his hypothesis turned out to be wrong, Mojica's supervisor surmised at the time that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in \"Haloferax volcanii\". Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time. By 2000, Mojica performed a survey of scientific literature and one of his students performed a search in published genomes with a program devised by himself. They identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes as belonging to the same family. In 2001, Mojica and Ruud Jansen, who were searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in the scientific literature. In 2002, Tang, et al. showed evidence that CRISPR repeat regions from the genome of \"Archaeoglobus fulgidus\" were transcribed into long RNA molecules that were subsequently processed into unit-length small RNAs, plus some longer forms of 2, 3, or more spacer-repeat units.\n\nA major addition to the understanding of CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or \"cas\" genes. Four \"cas\" genes (\"cas\" 1–4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed helicase and nuclease motifs, suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci. In this publication the acronym CRISPR was used as the universal name of this pattern. However, the CRISPR function remained enigmatic.\nIn 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids. In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/\"cas\" system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria. All three studies proposing this idea were initially rejected by high-profile journals, but eventually appeared in other journals.\n\nThe first publication proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by the researchers at the University of Alicante, predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the RNA interference system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.\n\nExperimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an adaptive immune system was published. A CRISPR region in \"Streptococcus thermophilus\" acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage. The researchers manipulated the resistance of \"S. thermophilus\" to different types of phage by adding and deleting spacers whose sequence matched those found in the tested phages. In 2008, Brouns and Van der Oost identified a complex of Cas proteins (called Cascade) that in \"E. coli\" cut the CRISPR RNA precursor within the repeats into mature spacer-containing RNA molecules called CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which remained bound to the protein complex. Moreover, it was found that Cascade, crRNA and a helicase/nuclease (Cas3) were required to provide a bacterial host with immunity against infection by a DNA virus. By designing an anti-virus CRISPR, they demonstrated that two orientations of the crRNA (sense/antisense) provided immunity, indicating that the crRNA guides were targeting dsDNA. That year Marraffini and Sontheimer confirmed that a CRISPR sequence of \"S. epidermidis\" targeted DNA and not RNA to prevent conjugation. This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in \"Pyrococcus furiosus\". A 2010 study showed that CRISPR-Cas cuts both strands of phage and plasmid DNA in \"S. thermophilus\".\n\nResearchers studied a simpler CRISPR system from \"Streptococcus pyogenes\" that relies on the protein Cas9. The Cas9 endonuclease is a four-component system that includes two small crRNA molecules and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA). Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier re-engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a \"single-guide RNA\" that, when combined with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA. By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, the artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage. Another group of collaborators comprising Virginijus Šikšnys together with Gasiūnas, Barrangou and Horvath showed that Cas9 from the \"S. thermophilus\" CRISPR system can also be reprogrammed to target a site of their choosing by changing the sequence of its crRNA. These advances fueled efforts to edit genomes with the modified CRISPR-Cas9 system.\n\nGroups led by Feng Zhang and George Church simultaneously published descriptions of genome editing in human cell cultures using CRISPR-Cas9 for the first time. It has since been used in a wide range of organisms, including baker's yeast (\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"), the opportunistic pathogen \"Candida albicans\", zebrafish (\"Danio rerio\"), fruit flies (\"Drosophila melanogaster\"), ants (\"Harpegnathos saltator\" and \"Ooceraea biroi\"), mosquitoes (\"Aedes aegypti\"), nematodes (\"Caenorhabditis elegans\"), plants, mice, monkeys and human embryos.\n\nCRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.\n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system has shown to make effective gene edits in Human tripronuclear zygotes first described in a 2015 paper by Chinese scientists P. Liang and Y. Xu. The system made a successful cleavage of mutant Beta-Hemoglobin (HBB) in 28 out of 54 embryos. 4 out of the 28 embryos were successfully recombined using a donor template given by the scientists. The scientists showed that during DNA recombination of the cleaved strand, the homologous endogenous sequence HBD competes with the exogenous donor template. DNA repair in human embryos is much more complicated and particular than in derived stem cells.\n\nIn 2015, the nuclease Cas12a (formerly known as Cpf1) was characterized in the CRISPR/Cpf1 system of the bacterium \"Francisella novicida\". Its original name, from a TIGRFAMs protein family definition built in 2012, reflects the prevalence of its CRISPR-Cas subtype in the Prevotella and Francisella lineages. Cas12a showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the 'blunt' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a 'T rich' PAM (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9) and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast Cas9 requires both crRNA and a transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA).\n\nThese differences may give Cas12a some advantages over Cas9. For example, Cas12a's small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9's sgRNAs. As well, the sticky 5′ overhangs left by Cas12a can be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional Restriction Enzyme cloning. Finally, Cas12a cleaves DNA 18–23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site. This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cas12a enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in indel mutations which destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur.\n\nThe CRISPR array is made up of an AT-rich leader sequence followed by short repeats that are separated by unique spacers. CRISPR repeats typically range in size from 28 to 37 base pairs (bps), though there can be as few as 23 bp and as many as 55 bp. Some show dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a stem-loop ('hairpin') in the RNA, while others are designed to be unstructured. The size of spacers in different CRISPR arrays is typically 32 to 38 bp (range 21 to 72 bp). New spacers can appear rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection. There are usually fewer than 50 units of the repeat-spacer sequence in a CRISPR array.\n\nSmall clusters of \"cas\" genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively the 93 \"cas\" genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. 11 of the 35 families form the \"cas\" core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9. A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the \"cas\" core.\n\nCRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes. Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose. Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI. The 6 system types are divided into 19 subtypes. Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a \"signature gene\" found almost exclusively in the category. Classification is also based on the complement of \"cas\" genes that are present. Most CRISPR-Cas systems have a Cas1 protein. The phylogeny of Cas1 proteins generally agrees with the classification system. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components. The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n\nCRISPR-Cas immunity is a natural process of bacteria and archaea. CRISPR-Cas prevents bacteriophage infection, conjugation and natural transformation by degrading foreign nucleic acids that enter the cell.\n\nWhen a microbe is invaded by a bacteriophage, the first stage of the immune response is to capture phage DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in both types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.\n\nMultiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved. Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner. Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either (single strand) ssRNA- or (double strand) dsDNA- specific endoribonuclease activity.\n\nIn the I-E system of \"E. coli\" Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers. In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role, binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays. New spacers are usually added at the beginning of the CRISPR next to the leader sequence creating a chronological record of viral infections. In \"E. coli\" a histone like protein called integration host factor (IHF), which binds to the leader sequence, is responsible for the accuracy of this integration. IHF also enhances integration efficiency in the type I-F system of \"Pectobacterium atrosepticum\". but in other systems different host factors may be required\n\nBioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3–5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition. In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array. The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.\n\nNew spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner, occurring preferentially, but not exclusively, adjacent to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from \"E. coli\" demonstrated that the first direct repeat adjacent to the leader sequence, is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.\n\nThe PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nt of the protospacer. This nt becomes the final base in the first direct repeat. This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position. It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.\n\nAnalysis of \"Sulfolobus solfataricus\" CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion, as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.\n\nMultiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of \"E. coli\". A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer. This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.\n\nCRISPR-RNA (crRNA), which later guides the Cas nuclease to the target during the interference step, must be generated from the CRISPR sequence. The crRNA is initially transcribed as part of a single long transcript encompassing much of the CRISPR array. This transcript is then cleaved by Cas proteins to form crRNAs. The mechanism to produce crRNAs differs among CRISPR/Cas systems. In type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops created by the pairing of identical repeats that flank the crRNA. These Cas proteins cleave the longer transcript at the edge of the paired region, leaving a single crRNA along with a small remnant of the paired repeat region.\n\nType III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the longer transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage just upstream of the repeat sequence.\n\nType II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer, which is instead truncated at one end.\n\nCrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system. The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins bound to a single crRNA.\n\nDuring the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n\nType II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step. Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n\nType III systems, like type I require six or seven Cas proteins binding to crRNAs. The type III systems analysed from \"S. solfataricus\" and \"P. furiosus\" both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome, which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes. Type III systems were also found to target DNA in addition to RNA using a different Cas protein in the complex, Cas10. The DNA cleavage was shown to be transcription dependent.\n\nThe mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage. RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n\nThe cas genes in the adaptor and effector modules of the CRISPR-Cas system are believed to have evolved from two different ancestral modules. A transposon-like element called casposon encoding the Cas1-like integrase and potentially other components of the adaptation module was inserted next to the ancestral effector module, which likely functioned as an independent innate immune system. The highly conserved cas1 and cas2 genes of the adaptor module evolved from the ancestral module while a variety of class 1 effector was genes evolved from the ancestral effector module. The evolution of these various class 1 effector module cas genes was guided by various mechanisms, such as duplication events. On the other hand, each type of class 2 effector module arose from subsequent independent insertions of mobile genetic elements. These mobile genetic elements took the place of the multiple gene effector modules to create single gene effector modules that produce large proteins which perform all the necessary tasks of the effector module. The spacer regions of CRISPR-Cas systems are taken directly from foreign mobile genetic elements and thus their long term evolution is hard to trace. The non-random evolution of these spacer regions has been found to be highly dependent on the environment and the particular foreign mobile genetic elements it contains.\n\nCRISPR/Cas can immunize bacteria against certain phages and thus halt transmission. For this reason, Koonin described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism. However, this was disputed by a critic who noted, \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works\". But as more recent studies have been conducted, it has become apparent that the acquired spacer regions of CRISPR-Cas systems are indeed a form of Lamarckian evolution because they are genetic mutations that are acquired and then passed on. On the other hand, the evolution of the Cas gene machinery that facilitates the system evolves through classic Darwinian evolution.\n\nAnalysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes. Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, \"Francisella novicida\" uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for \"F. novicida\" to dampen host response and promote virulence.\n\nThe basic model of CRISPR evolution is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To resist a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer. Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.\n\nA study of 124 \"S. thermophilus\" strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of spacer acquisition. Some CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that \"E. coli\" and \"S. enterica\" evolve much more slowly than \"S. thermophilus\". The latter's strains that diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.\n\nMetagenomic analysis of two acid-mine-drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions versus the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community than the other. In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7–22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% were shared across individuals.\n\nFrom the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Broad-level results of spacer presence/absence showed significant diversity. However, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months, suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly.\n\nCRISPRs were analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project. Although most were body-site specific, some within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ≈15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some showed little evolution over time.\n\nCRISPR evolution was studied in chemostats using \"S. thermophilus\" to directly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, \"S. thermophilus\" strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage. During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.\n\nAnother \"S. thermophilus\" experiment showed that phages can infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer. Yet another showed that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres. The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n\nCRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea and show some sequence similarities. Their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeats decreases the likelihood of a false positive match.\n\nAnalysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble, due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content. However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. Degenerate repeat-specific primers can be used to amplify CRISPR spacers directly from environmental samples; amplicons containing two or three spacers can be then computationally assembled to reconstruct long CRISPR arrays.\n\nThe alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely \"de novo\" identification or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA) and direct repeat sequences from published genomes as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n\nAnother way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication. PICIs are induced, excised, replicated and finally packaged into small capsids by certain staphylococcal temperate phages. PICIs use several mechanisms to block phage reproduction. In first mechanism PICI-encoded Ppi differentially blocks phage maturation by binding or interacting specifically with phage TerS, hence blocks phage TerS/TerL complex formation responsible for phage DNA packaging. In second mechanism PICI CpmAB redirect the phage capsid morphogenetic protein to make 95% of SaPI-sized capsid and phage DNA can package only 1/3rd of their genome in these small capsid and hence become nonviable phage. The third mechanism involves two proteins, PtiA and PtiB, that target the LtrC, which is responsible for the production of virion and lysis proteins. This interference mechanism is modulated by a modulatory protein, PtiM, binds to one of the interference-mediating proteins, PtiA, and hence achieving the required level of interference.\n\nOne study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets \"Vibrio cholerae\" serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a \"V. cholera\" PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the I-F system found in \"Yersinia pestis\". Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.\n\nCertain archaeal viruses were shown to carry mini-CRISPR arrays containing one or two spacers. It has been shown that spacers within the virus-borne CRISPR arrays target other viruses and plasmids, suggesting that mini-CRISPR arrays represent a mechanism of heterotypic superinfection exclusion and participate in interviral conflicts.\n\nCRISPR technology has been applied in the food and farming industries to engineer probiotic cultures and to immunize industrial cultures (for yogurt, for instance) versus infections. It is also being used in crops to enhance yield, drought tolerance and nutritional homes.\n\nBy the end of 2014 some 1000 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR. The technology had been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study \"Candida albicans\", to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains. CRISPR can also be used to change mosquitos so they cannot transmit diseases such as malaria. CRISPR based approaches utilizing Cas12a have recently been utilized in the successful modification of a broad number of plant species.\n\nIn July 2019, CRISPR was used to experimentally treat a patient with a genetic disorder. The patient was a 34-year-old woman with sickle cell disease.\n\nIn March 2020, CRISPR-modified virus was injected into a patient's eye in an attempt to treat Leber congenital amaurosis.\n\nIn the future, CRISPR gene editing could be used to create new species or revive extinct species from closely related ones.\n\nCRISPR-based re-evaluations of claims for gene-disease relationships have led to the discovery of potentially important anomalies.\n\nCRISPR associated nucleases have shown to be useful as a tool for molecular testing due to their ability to specifically target nucleic acid sequences in a high background of non-target sequences. In 2016, the Cas9 nuclease was used to deplete unwanted nucleotide sequences in next-generation sequencing libraries while requiring only 250 pg of initial RNA input. Beginning in 2017, CRISPR associated nucleases were also used for direct diagnostic testing, down to single molecule sensitivity. In 2019, some new diagnostic applications using CRISPR technology, an electrical CRISPR-Chip for the detection of genetic mutations and a microfluidic CRISPR-Biosensor for electrochemical miRNA diagnostics, were introduced.\n\n\n"}

It is the first single on which all the songs were written without guitarist Bernard Butler, since Richard Oakes had taken his place. The single is tied with \"Stay Together\" as the band's highest charting at number three; however, it outsold the earlier single, thus making it their biggest-selling single. Outside the UK, the song topped the Finnish Singles Chart in late August and reached the top five in Denmark, Iceland and Sweden.\n\nVarious meanings have been given to the song, but the main themes seem to be about 'outsiders', being different but living well with it. In a 2013 interview, Anderson expanded this theme, saying: \"It’s a song that’s kind of about being in the band and, by extension, it’s a song about the fans and the whole kind of ethos of being a Suede… person.\" He also described it as the soundtrack to his life, saying \"It's about believing in the romance of the everyday.\" In an interview in late 2009, for the SkyArts' Songbook series, Anderson said about the song:\n\n\"\"I actually wrote it about the band Suede. It's a celebration of the band, but by extension, it's a celebration of the fans as well. And it was a kind of a song written about us, as a gang, it was written about the values we stood for. And even though it sounds like a love song, it was actually about the idea of the identity of the band, and what they stood for.\"\"\n\nThe video for the title song was filmed at Elstree Studios and directed by David Mould. It features the whole band performing in a crowded, up-market bar decorated in garish primary colours among people in glamorous, high-end fashions of the day. The video also marks the first appearance of a new band member, keyboard player Neil Codling.\n\nThe song proved to be a successful comeback single for Suede, receiving praise from critics. \"Melody Maker\" had proclaimed the song \"single of the week\" a fortnight prior to release. Tania Branigan called it \"bitterly sweet, a love song for strangers; fast, in every sense of the word.\" In reference to the single's B-sides, she said: \"In the finest 'Drowners' tradition, the two B-sides are almost finer.\" Ted Kessler of \"NME\" said: \"So the scaremongers were wrong. Brett Anderson is the creative force behind Suede. Here's the proof: this week sees the release of their first post-Bernard Butler single and nobody can really admit that they thought it would sound half as good as it does.\" Kevin Courtney of \"The Irish Times\" said it is \"probably their most direct and immediate pop statement to date.\" \"Music & Media\" wrote: \"They haven't lost their camp, dramatic touch (piped strings!), distorted guitars and strong melodies. Great summer record.\" \"The Telegraph\" called it an \"instant, flawless, three-minute essence-of-pop, as irresistible as 'Satisfaction' or 'Ride a White Swan'.\"\n\nA 2014 poll by US music magazine \"Paste\" marking the 20th anniversary of Britpop listed \"Trash\" at number 14 in its list, \"The 50 Best Britpop Songs.\" Michael Danaher wrote: \"The song is a festering, anthemic pop gem that featuring a glorious chorus and guitar and synth-driven rhythm. A vastly underrated song this side of the Atlantic.\" In a public poll by \"NME\", \"Trash\" was placed at no. 9 in its list \"50 Greatest Britpop Songs Ever,\" and said: \"with 'Trash', Suede made being a glam weirdo seem like the most appealing thing in the world.\"\nA different version of the song appears on the group's 2003 compilation album \"Singles\", where the vocals were re-recorded along with an alternative ending. All four of the singles' B-sides were included on Suede's compilation \"Sci-Fi Lullabies\", which was released the following year, although the version of \"Europe is our Playground\" was a new version and not the original B-side version found here. \"Europe is Our Playground\" also marks the songwriting debut of bass guitarist Mat Osman.\n\nA cover of \"Trash\" is featured on the 2009 album \"Rocket Science\" by Norwegian electro-rock band Apoptygma Berzerk.\n\nAll songs by Brett Anderson and Richard Oakes except where noted.\n\n\n\n"}

He supported Hanoverian independence (\"particularism\") and was loyal to monarchism. He was not a Liberal but they admired his opposition to the king's reactionary policies and his strong support for an independent judiciary and the rights of the accused. He served in 1851 and 1862 as minister of justice.\n\nWhen Prussia absorbed Hanover and then set up the German Empire in 1871, Windthorst dealt with the new state of affairs and became a leader of the all-Catholic Centre Party. It won over 80% of the Catholic vote in a new nation that was one-third Catholic. He opposed Bismarck's harassment of minorities such as Catholics, Hanoverian Guelphs, Poles, Danes, and Alsatians. He argued for natural law as the basis of political rights. He perfected the arts of opposition, forming alliances that could win majorities. The Centre party became what Anderson calls \"a liberal party manque.\" That is, it kept its distance from the anti-Catholic National Liberal Party but championed the rights of minorities, the powers of parliament, and the rule of law against Bismarck's moves.\n\nIn the 1870s, he was a vigorous enemy of the Bismarck's Kulturkampf, which persecuted the Catholic Church in Prussia in an effort to destroy papal control. Bismarck eventually lost, but it was Pope Leo XIII who negotiated with Bismarck in the end, cutting out Windthorst.\n\nWindthorst was born at Kaldenhof manor in the present-day municipality of Ostercappeln, in the lands of the former Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück, which had been secularised to the Electorate of Hanover under the Protestant Welf dynasty in 1803. The growth-restricted boy was raised in a Roman Catholic family, which for some generations had held important posts in the bishopric's civil service. Windthorst became a half-orphan at the age of ten, when his father died in 1822. He was educated at the Gymnasium Carolinum, an endowed school at Osnabrück which he left with excellent \"Abitur\" exams, and from 1830 studied law at the universities of Göttingen and Heidelberg. Influenced by the rise of liberalism during the \"Vormärz\" era and the 1832 Hambach Festival as well as by the Catholic theologian Georg Hermes, Windthorst tried to bring his Catholic confession in accordance with the ideals of liberty, civil rights and national unity.\n\nIn 1836, Windthorst settled down as an advocate in Osnabrück: his abilities soon procured him a considerable practice, and he was appointed president of the Catholic consistory in 1842. Though socially disadvantaged, the Catholics had remained loyal to the ruling House of Hanover during the 1837 insurrection of the Göttingen Seven against King Ernest Augustus, and in 1848 Windthorst received an appointment at the supreme court of appeal (\"Oberappellationsgericht\") for the Kingdom of Hanover at Celle. The March Revolution opened for him—as for so many of his contemporaries—the way to public life and though he failed to gain a mandate for the Frankfurt Assembly, he was elected representative for his native district in the second chamber of the reformed Hanoverian parliament in 1849. He belonged to what was called the Greater German party, and opposed the project of reconstituting Germany under the leadership of the Kingdom of Prussia. He defended the government against the liberal and democratic opposition; and, at this time, he began his struggle against the secularization of schools, which continued throughout his life.\n\nIn 1851, he was elected president of the chamber and, in the same year, minister of justice, the first Catholic who had held so high an office in Hanover. As minister, he carried through an important judicial reform—which had been prepared by his predecessor—but had to retire from office because he was opposed to the reactionary measures for restoring the influence and privileges of the nobility. Though he was always an enemy to liberalism, his natural independence of character prevented him from acquiescing in the reactionary measures of the king. In 1862, he again was appointed minister, but with others of his colleagues, he resigned when the king refused his assent to a measure for extending the franchise. Windthorst took no part in the critical Austro-Prussian War; contrary to the opinion of many of his friends, after the annexation of Hanover by Prussia, he accepted the \"fait accompli\", took the oath of allegiance, and was elected a member both of the Prussian parliament and of the North German diet.\n\nAt Berlin, he found a wider field for his abilities. He acted as representative of his exiled king in the negotiations with the Prussian government concerning his private property, and opposed the sequestration, and for the first time was placed in a position of hostility to Otto von Bismarck. He was recognized as the leader of the Hanoverians and of all those above who opposed the revolution. He took a leading part in the formation of the party of the Center in 1870–1871, but he did not become a member of it, for he feared that his reputation as a follower of the king of Hanover would injure the party; that is, until the leaders formally requested that he join them.\nAfter the death of Hermann von Mallinckrodt (1821–1874) in 1874, Windthorst became leader of the party and maintained that position until his death. It was chiefly owing to his skill and courage as a parliamentary debater and his tact as a leader, that the party held its own and constantly increased in numbers during the great struggle with the Prussian government. He was especially exposed to the attacks of Bismarck, who attempted, personally, to discredit him and to separate him from the rest of the party. And, he was by far the ablest and most dangerous critic of Bismarck's policy. The change of policy in 1879 led to a great alteration in his position: he was reconciled to Bismarck and even sometimes attended receptions at Bismarck's house. Never, however, was his position so difficult as during the negotiations which led to a repeal of the May laws.\n\nOn the background of rising anti-Semitism, he stood up for the Jews and enforced the expulsion of anti-Semitic members from the Center Party.\n\nIn 1887, Bismarck appealed to the Pope to use his authority to order the Center to support the military proposals of the government. Windthorst took the responsibility of keeping the papal instructions secret from the rest of his party and of disobeying the instructions. In a great meeting at Cologne in March 1887, he defended and justified his action, and claimed for the Center full independence of action in all purely political questions. In the social reform, he supported Bismarck, and as the undisputed leader of the largest party in the Reichstag, he was able to exercise influence over the action of the government after Bismarck's retirement. His relations with the emperor William II became very cordial, and in 1891 he achieved a great parliamentary triumph by defeating the School bill and compelling Gossler to resign.\n\nWindthorst died of pneumonia, on 14 March 1891, in Berlin. Two days before, Emperor Wilhelm II paid him a visit at his deathbed. He was buried in the Marienkirche in Hannover, which had been erected from the money subscribed as a testimonial to him. The church was destroyed by bombing raids which occurred from July 1943-March 1945 during the Second World War, though his grave was spared, and reconstructed in 1953/4. His funeral was a most remarkable display of public esteem, in which nearly all the ruling princes of Germany joined, and was a striking sign of the position to which, after twenty years of incessant struggle, he had raised his party.\n\nAccording to historian Golo Mann, Windthorst was one of the greatest of German parliamentary leaders: no one equaled him in his readiness as a debater—his defective eyesight compelling him to depend entirely upon his memory. It was his misfortune that nearly all his life was spent in opposition, and he had no opportunity of showing his abilities as an administrator. He enjoyed unbounded popularity and confidence among the German Catholics, but he was in no way an ecclesiastic: he was at first opposed to the Vatican decrees of 1870, but quickly accepted them after they had been proclaimed. He was a very agreeable companion and a thorough man of the world, singularly free from arrogance and pomposity—owing to his small stature, he was often known as \"die kleine Excellenz\".\n\nWindthorst married Juliane (Julie) Sybille Caroline Engelen (12/09/1805 Oedingberge - 26/01/1898, Hanover) on May 29, 1839: of his four living children, three died before him. They were Maria (26/09/1841-2/02/1933), Anna (12/04/1843-19/03/1867), Julius (15/11/1844-18/11/1872), Eduard (7/07/1846-24/04/1860).\n\nWindthorst's \"Ausgewählte Reden\" were published in three volumes (Osnabrück, 1901–1902).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the centre of the rural \"Hustopečsko\" region, known for fruit and wine growing.\n\nThe town is situated in the historic Moravia region, within the southern foothills of the Ždánice Forest range. The town centre is located about northwest of the district capital Břeclav. In the northeast, the D2 motorway runs from Brno to the border with Slovakia. \n\nAbout 6,000 inhabitants live in the municipal area.\n\nHustopeče was first mentioned in a 1247 deed, at the time when the Czech Přemyslid dynasty ruled the Margraviate of Moravia. From the 11th century onwards, the area around Mikulov and Znojmo had been settled by German colonists in the course of the \"Ostsiedlung\" movement, mainly descending from the Austrian lands in the southwest. Local nobles and feudal lords were followers of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. When in 1306 the male line of the Přemyslids became extinct, Hustopeče passed to Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia; she granted the estates to the Cistercian nuns in Brno.\n\nIn 1572 Emperor Maximilian II officially vested Hustopeče with town privileges. During the 16th century, it developed as an important trade centre on the route from Prague to Hungary. It also became a centre of radical Anabaptists and the Hutterite movement. Upon the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, the Habsburg rulers enacted several Counter-Reformation measures to enforce the return of the citizens to the Catholic faith. The town was repeatedly looted and burned during the Thirty Years' War; in 1643 and 1645, it was devastated by Swedish troops under Field Marshal Lennart Torstensson. During the Great Turkish War and the 1683 Battle of Vienna, Hustopeče was occupied by Ottoman forces.\n\nIn 1756 the Piarists established a first gymnasium here. On 18 July 1894, Hustopeče received access to a \"Lokalbahn\" branch line to Šakvice and the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway from Vienna to Prague. Until 1918, \"Auspitz – Hustopeče\" (\"Auspitz\" until the mid-19th century) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austrian side after the Compromise of 1867), in the district with the same name, one of the 34 \"Bezirkshauptmannschaften\" in the Cisleithanian Margraviate of Moravia. According to a 1910 census, most of its inhabitants were ethnic Germans.\n\nAfter World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, large parts of the South Moravian region were claimed by the newly established Republic of German-Austria; nevertheless, according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain, Hustopeče and it surroundings passed the First Czechoslovak Republic.\nAfter the Munich Agreement in 1938, it was occupied by Nazi Germany and incorporated into \"Reichsgau Niederdonau\" as one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. After World War II, Hustopeče returned to Czechoslovakia and the remaining German-speaking population was expelled according to the Beneš decrees.\n\nThe town skyline was dominated by the Gothic parish church dedicated to Saint Wenceslaus and Agnes of Bohemia, built in the late 12th century. Though renovated several times, its high steeple collapsed in 1961, which damaged the church's structure greatly. One year later, the Communist government ordered the building to be torn down. \n\nAfter the Velvet Revolution, a new futuristic church was built on the site of the old one between 1990 and 1994, and was designed by L. Kolka. The new St. Wenceslaus' church has a high steeple ( including its cross).\n\nEach year in late January, Hustopeče is host to the world's best high jumpers competing in the Moravia High Jump Tour. The narrow basketball gymnasium in Hustopeče routinely produces world-leading jumps by both men and women.\n\n\nHustopeče is twinned with:\n\n"}

As created, they are sub-divisions of non-metropolitan counties (colloquially \"shire counties\") in a two-tier arrangement.\n\nNon-metropolitan districts are subdivisions of English non-metropolitan counties which have a two-tier structure of local government. Most non-metropolitan counties have a county council, and also have several districts, each with a borough or district council. In these cases local government functions are divided between county and district councils, to the level where they can be practised most efficiently:\n\n\nMany districts have borough status, which means the local council is called a \"borough council\" instead of \"district council\" and gives them the right to appoint a mayor. Borough status is granted by royal charter and, in many cases, continues a style enjoyed by a predecessor authority, which can date back centuries. Some districts such as Oxford or Exeter have city status, granted by letters patent, but this does not give the local council any extra powers other than the right to call itself a \"city council\". Not all city or borough councils are non-metropolitan districts, many being unitary authorities – districts which are ceremonially part of a non-metropolitan county, but not run by the county council – or metropolitan districts – which were subdivisions of the metropolitan counties created in 1974, but whose county councils were abolished in 1986 and are effectively unitary authorities and have the same powers.\n\nBy 1899, England had been divided at district level into rural districts, urban districts, municipal boroughs, county boroughs and metropolitan boroughs. This system was abolished by the London Government Act 1963 and the Local Government Act 1972. Non-metropolitan districts were created by this act in 1974 when England outside Greater London was divided into metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan counties. Metropolitan counties were sub-divided into metropolitan districts and the non-metropolitan counties were sub-divided into non-metropolitan districts. The metropolitan districts had more powers than their non-metropolitan counterparts. Initially, there were 296 non-metropolitan districts in the two-tier structure, but reforms in the 1990s and 2009 reduced their number to 192. A further 55 non-metropolitan districts are now unitary authorities, which combine the functions of county and borough/district councils.\n\nIn Wales, an almost identical two-tier system of local government existed between 1974 and 1996 (see Districts of Wales). In 1996, this was abolished and replaced with an entirely unitary system of local government, with one level of local government responsible for all local services. Since the areas for Wales and England had been enacted separately and there were no Welsh metropolitan areas, the term 'non-metropolitan district' does not apply to Wales. A similar system existed in Scotland, which in 1975 was divided into regions and districts, this was also abolished in 1996 and replaced with a fully unitary system.\n\nIn England 200 out of the 201 non-metropolitan district councils are represented by the District Councils' Network, special interest group which sits within the Local Government Association. The network's purpose is to \"act as an informed and representative advocate for districts to government and other national bodies, based on their unique position to deliver for ‘local’ people.”\n\nThis is a list of two-tier non-metropolitan counties and their districts. All unitary authorities are non-metropolitan districts, which, with the exception of those of Berkshire, are coterminous with non-metropolitan counties.\n\nFor a full list of districts of all types including unitary authorities, metropolitan districts and London boroughs, see Districts of England.\n\nThis is a list of former two-tier districts in England which have been abolished, by local government reorganisations such as the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. It does not include districts that still exist after becoming a unitary authority or those that transferred from one county to another, including those that changed name. Nor does it include unitary authorities that have been abolished (Bournemouth and Poole).\n\n\n"}

It is a composite tale containing a story of how Freyja acquired a necklace from the Dwarves, how that led to a bloody war, and how Olaf Tryggvason brought peace to the land.\n\nThe story parallels elements of earlier stories such as \"Heimskringla\" (euhemerization of gods), parts of the poem \"Lokasenna\" (Loki's accusation of Gefjun sleeping with a boy for a necklace), parts of the \"Húsdrápa\" poem (Loki stealing the necklace Brísingamen), and the eternal battle \"Hjaðningavíg\" (various earlier sources). In the end of the story, the arrival of Christianity dissolves the old curse that was traditionally to endure until Ragnarök.\n\nThe story has been described as \"post-classical\" due to elements such as the descriptor of Loki as \"cunning\" without apparent irony, featuring Freyja and Loki as court retainers, and the open representation of Freyja's sexuality that it features. 19th century scholar Benjamin Thorpe referred to Freyja's role in the tale as \"rather awkward\".\n\nThe tale begins in Asia, and a land called Asialand, saying that Odin was the King there; and relates that Freyja was the daughter of Njord and Odin's concubine, whom Odin loved very much.\n\nThen it introduces four dwarves named Álfrigg, Dvalinn (Dwalin), Berlingr and Grérr and since they were dwarves they were skilled craftsmen and lived in a large stone. But in those days, they mingled more with people than they do today.\nOne day, Freyja saw that the Dwarves were making a beautiful collar and she offered them both gold and silver in exchange for it. But, the Dwarves would only sell it to her in exchange for one night each with her. Freyja agreed and after four nights with the Dwarves, she returned with the beautiful collar.\n\nLoki is then introduced and reveals that he was the son of Fárbauti and his wife Laufey, who was called \"needle\" because she was so slender. Loki became very popular with Odin because of his gift for providing information.\n\nWhen Loki told Odin of Freyja's collar, Odin asked him to fetch the collar or never to return, so Loki transformed himself into a fly and found a way into Freyja's bower. When he found her, he saw that she had the collar on and lay on her back. He turned into a flea and bit her whereupon she turned so he could unlock the collar and steal it. Then he returned to Odin and gave him the collar.\n\nWhen Freyja woke up, she learned that Odin had got hold of the collar and asked to have it back. Odin said that he knew how she had acquired the collar and that he would only let her have it back on the condition that she enchanted two kings and twenty subordinate kings so that they would fight each other every night, die and rise again, until a Christian lord entered the battle and defeated them all. Freyja promised that so would be done and got the collar back.\nKing Erlingr was a king of Oppland and he had a queen and the sons Sörli and Erlendr. Sörli and Erlendr went pillaging as Vikings as soon as their age permitted and one day they began to fight Sindri Sveigisson, the grandson of Haki at Elfarsker (the islands outside modern Gothenburg ). The battle ended with the death of both Sindri and Erlendr, after which Sörli sailed into the Baltic sea (Eystra salt) to harry.\n\nThe king of Denmark was called Halfdan and he resided in Roskilde (\"Hróiskelda\") and was married to Hvedna the old. Their sons were named Högni and Hakon and they were great warriors.\n\nWhen Sörli arrived in Denmark he saw a great longship, which king Halfdan was about to board in order to attend a royal meeting. Sörli decided to kill the king and appropriate the great ship, in spite of his marshal Sævar's warnings about Högni and Hakon. Halfdan fought heroically, but was slain and Sörli sailed away with the dragon ship.\n\nSörli later learnt that Högni had returned from an expedition and was moored at Odense, and so he sailed to meet Högni and tell him about his father's demise. He wanted to offer Högni and Hakon recompensation and to become foster-brethren, but the two brothers would have none of it. After a battle in which Hakon, Sævar and Erlingr died, and finally Sörli fell. However, Högni healed Sörli and agreed to enter sworn brotherhood.\n\nAfter some time Sörli died in the East, an event for which there is a poem . When Högni learnt of this he went east, won many victories and finally became king there with twenty kings as paying vassals. He was famous from the land of the Finns to Paris.\n\nIn Serkland, there was a king named Hjarandi, who had a son named Hedinn. This son was a great sea-king and he pillaged all over the Mediterranean until twenty kings paid tribute to him. One day he met a beautiful woman sitting on a chair who called herself Göndul. She told him of Högni, and agitated him to test his strength against the northerner. Hedinn took three hundred men, and sailed both a summer and a winter until he arrived in Denmark in spring.\n\nWhen the two men met they tested each other's strength and entered sworn brotherhood. As Hedinn was unmarried, Högni betrothed him to his daughter Hildr, his only child. Hildr's mother was Hervor, the daughter of Hjörvard who was the son of of the \"Hervarar saga\". Hedinn soon met Göndul again, who asked him about what had happened since the last time. She gave him a magic potion and told him to crush Högni's wife with the prow of his ship and to kidnap Hildr. He did so, and Göndul then gave him a new horn to drink, and he fell asleep. In his dream, he heard Göndul reveal that she was a valkyrie and that she put him, Högni and their men under spells according to the wishes of Odin.\n\nHögni hunted Hedinn and found him on an island named Hoy. Hedinn offered to give everything back to Högni and to sail away to Serkland and never come back. Högni, however, declared that nothing could atone the betrayal that Hedinn had committed.\n\nThe two armies started to fight and even though they cut each other all over, they stood still fighting and fighting for 143 years, so strong were the spells of Göndul, until Olaf Tryggvason arrived at the island.\n\nOlaf and his crew grew concerned about the number of men who went to the island but never came back. Ivar Gleam-bright took his sword that he had got from Thorstein, the son of Iron-shield, the former owner, and went into the island. There he met a big and bloodied man of sorrowful contenance. It was Hedinn who told Ivar of the curse. Hedinn said that in order to be delivered from the curse, a Christian army had to fight with them, and every man who was slain by a Christian would remain dead. However, Hedinn advised Ivar not to look Högni in the face because Högni wore the Horror helmet (\"ægishjálmr\"). Instead Hedinn would fight Högni and Ivar would kill Högni from the behind. Ivar did so, and killed all the men until only Hedinn was left and was slain. Ivar went to see Hildr, but she had vanished.\n\nIvar went to see the king in the morning and told everybody of the event. The king and the men followed him to the battle ground, but everything had vanished and there was nothing to be seen. Only the blood on Ivar's sword testified to what had taken place.\n\n"}

He filled those roles on NBC's \"The Today Show\" from January 15, 1973, after starting part-time in 1970, until his retirement on November 11, 2010. He is known for his frequent use of puns, his oversized handlebar moustache and fuzzy hair, and for wearing colorful bowties.\n\nAccording to his official MSNBC bio,\n\nShalit was born in a New York hospital on March 25, 1926, and eight days later arrived in Newark, New Jersey, in company of his mother. In 1932 he accompanied his family when they moved to Morristown, New Jersey. In Morristown High School he wrote the school paper's humor column (prophetically called \"The Broadcaster\"), and narrowly escaped expulsion.\n\nBorn to Jewish parents, Shalit attended Morristown High School, where he wrote a humor column for the school newspaper.\n\nGene Shalit wrote for \"The Daily Illini\" for six years at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (1943–1949).\n\nShalit, according to a \"New York Times Magazine\" interview of Dick Clark, was Clark's press agent in the early 1960s. Shalit reportedly \"stopped representing\" Clark during a Congressional investigation of payola. Clark never spoke to Shalit again, and referred to him as a \"jellyfish\", an informal term for \"a person without strong resolve or stamina\".\n\nShalit has been involved in reviewing the arts since 1967 and has written for such publications as \"Look\" magazine, \"Ladies' Home Journal\" (for 12 years), \"Cosmopolitan\", \"TV Guide\", \"Seventeen\", \"Glamour\", \"McCall's\", and \"The New York Times\". From 1970 to 1982 he had a daily essay on NBC Radio \"Man About Anything\", that was carried on more stations than any other NBC network radio feature.\n\nIn 1986, Shalit hosted a videocassette and laserdisc collection from MCA Home Video, \"Gene Shalit's Critic's Choice Video\". Four images (five on the laserdisc covers) of Shalit appeared in a filmstrip on the front of the box with his reviews on the back. Titles included \"Touch of Evil\", \"Destry Rides Again\", \"Double Indemnity\" and \"The Ipcress File\".\n\nIn 1987, Shalit published \"Laughing Matters: A Treasury of American Humor\", a critically praised humor anthology.\n\nShalit announced that he would leave \"The Today Show\" after 40 years, effective November 11, 2010. Of his decision, he was quoted as saying: \"It's enough already\". He has largely been reclusive since his retirement, only appearing once for Willard Scott's retirement in 2015.\n\nShalit was criticized by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) for his review of \"Brokeback Mountain\" in which he referred to Jake Gyllenhaal's character as a \"sexual predator\": GLAAD said Shalit's \"baseless branding of Jack as a 'sexual predator' merely because he is romantically interested in someone of the same sex is defamatory, ignorant, and irresponsible\" and that he \"used the occasion to promote defamatory antigay prejudice to a national audience.\" His gay son, Peter Shalit, wrote a letter to GLAAD defending his father and said GLAAD had defamed him by \"falsely accusing him of a repellent form of bigotry.\"\n\nGene Shalit was married to Nancy Shalit. For much of his career, Shalit lived in Leonia, New Jersey.\nShalit's children include the artist and entrepreneur Willa Shalit.

His daughter Emily died of ovarian cancer in 2012.\n\nShalit guest-starred as the voice, and was portrayed in the form, of a fish food critic named \"Gene Scallop\" in the \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" episode \"The Krusty Sponge\".\n\nHe has been parodied in several episodes of \"Family Guy\" in cutaway gags. In \"Brian Sings and Swings\", Shalit mugs Peter in a cutaway and makes threats using several movie title puns (\"Don't Panic Room ... I'm not going to William Hurt you. I only want your Tango & Cash. So just Pay it Forward and we'll all be Happy Gilmore!\"), which only serves to confuse Peter. In \"The Book of Joe\", Peter haunts Shalit and his fictional wife Joanne (who is identical to Shalit himself with a large moustache) by pretending to be the ghost of Roger Ebert. In another episode, Peter obtains the power of transformation and while in the form of Britney Spears he kisses Justin Timberlake and then turns into Shalit, exclaiming to a horrified Timberlake, \"I'm Gene Shalit now! BYE!\". In \"Big Man on Hippocampus\", Peter reads aloud a review that was supposedly written by Shalit.\n\nShalit also voiced his own likeness in three episodes of the animated series \"The Critic\".\n\nA Muppet character based on him appeared in \"\" (1975).\n\nShalit was occasionally portrayed on \"Saturday Night Live\" by Horatio Sanz in sketches and Weekend Update sequences.\n\n"}

Standing at , he mainly plays at the point guard position, but he can also play at the shooting guard position.\n\nUkić was born and raised in Split, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia, where he began playing basketball for the youth clubs of KK Split in 1992. He competed on cadet and junior teams for the club, winning the national youth championship twice with the cadet team, and earning the MVP award of the Croat cadet championship in 2000. Ukić joined the club's senior team, KK Split, in 2000, at the age of 16. He scored his first professional points on October 14, 2000, as his Split Croatia Insurance team won the game against KK Šibenik (93:79). Ukić finished the game with five points.\n\nAt the age of 17, Ukić was already the team's captain. During his five years with the club, he won the Croatian League championship in 2003, and the Croatian Cup in 2004. In the Croatian Cup final against KK Zadar, Ukić scored the winning buzzer beater. Ukić played for Split until 2005, when he was drafted by the NBA's Toronto Raptors in the second round, with the 41st pick overall, after averaging 18.5 points and 4.3 assists, in 35.2 minutes per game, for Split in the Adriatic League.\n\nRather than risk being buried on the bench as a reserve player in the NBA, he opted to join Tau Cerámica of the Spanish ACB League, a team that had an open spot at the backup point guard position in 2005. In his first season in a foreign league, Ukić became the first Croatian player to win the Spanish ACB League's Player of the week award. He got the award after scoring 27 points against CB Valladolid. Ukić won the Spanish Cup 2006, and played in the Spanish ACB League Playoffs, where his team eventually lost to Unicaja Malaga in the finals, by a 3–0 series score.\n\nAfter spending a season with Baskonia, he moved to Spanish League rivals FC Barcelona in the summer of 2006, where he also held the backup position at point guard. With Ukić in the line-up, Barcelona won the 2007 Spanish Cup , but lost the 2007 Spanish League finals versus Real Madrid, by a 3–1 series result.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, he moved to the Italian League team Virtus Roma, on a loan deal, where he was coached by his mentor and Croatian national basketball team head coach, Jasmin Repeša. Ukić had his best EuroLeague season with Virtus, averaging 12.7 points and 2.8 assists per game. He reached the Italian League's national championship finals, and once again his team was only second best. Montepaschi Siena won the finals by a 4–1 series result.\n\nOn July 16, 2008, Ukić agreed to a three-year deal with the NBA's Toronto Raptors. During his first NBA season, he appeared in 72 games, as a backup at point guard to his former Saski Baskonia teammate, José Calderón, wearing jersey #1 for the Raptors. In 12.4 minutes of play, he averaged 4.2 points and 2.1 assists, with career highs of 22 points on February 22, 2009, against the San Antonio Spurs, and 10 assists on March 27, 2009, against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, Ukić was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, along with Carlos Delfino, in exchange for Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems. On January 4, 2010, he was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks, at his own request, because he wasn't satisfied with his role on the team.\n\nAfter being waived by the Milwaukee Bucks during his second NBA season, in January 2010, Ukić returned to Europe, when he moved to the Turkish League club Fenerbahçe Ülker. He signed a two-year contract on June 17, 2010.\n\nUkić led his club to the 2009–10 Turkish Basketball League title, by hitting the game-winning shot in Game 3 of the league's finals and scoring 15 points in Game 6 win by a score of 76:51. The club had also previously won the Turkish Cup, with Ukić scoring 11 points in the Cup's final game versus Mersin BB.\n\nIn the 2010–11 season, Fenerbahçe repeated in winning the Turkish double. Ukić was voted the MVP of the Turkish League Playoffs. Fenerbahçe also reached the Top 16 phase of the EuroLeague, with Ukić posting averages of 13.2 points, 3.5 assists, and 2.5 rebounds per game. His final season with the Turkish club was injury plagued.\n\nUkić missed the start of the 2011–12 season, due to a stress fracture in his foot, and later on in the season, he suffered a broken finger.\n\nIn 2012, Ukić signed a two-year contract with the Greek League club Panathinaikos. In his first season with the club, he won the third double of his career. In the final of the Greek Cup, Panathinaikos beat Olympiacos 81:78, as Ukić scored 18 points, and won the Final MVP award.\n\nPanathinaikos and Olympiacos played again in Greece's League finals, and Panathinaikos claimed the title, with a 3–0 series sweep. Ukić was the leading scorer of the finals.

{"id": "2146148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146148", "title": "Field artillery", "text": "Field artillery\n\nField artillery is a category of mobile artillery used to support armies in the field. These weapons are specialized for mobility, tactical proficiency, short range, long range, and extremely long range target engagement.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, field artillery were also known as foot artillery, for while the guns were pulled by beasts of burden (often horses), the gun crews would usually march on foot, thus providing fire support mainly to the infantry. This was in contrast to horse artillery, whose emphasis on speed while supporting cavalry units necessitated lighter guns and crews riding on horseback.\n\nWhereas horse artillery has been superseded by self-propelled artillery, field artillery has survived to this day both in name and mission, albeit with motor vehicles towing the guns, carrying the crews and transporting the ammunition. Modern artillery has also advanced to rapidly deployable wheeled and tracked vehicles and precision delivered munitions capable of striking targets at ranges between 15 and 300 kilometers.\n\n\nEarly artillery was unsuited to the battlefield, as the extremely massive pieces could not be moved except in areas that were already controlled by the combatant. Thus, their role was limited to such functions as breaking sieges. Following the beginning of the gunpowder era, the first field artillery came into being as metallurgy allowed thinner cannon barrels to withstand the explosive forces without bursting. However, there was still a serious risk of the constant changes of the battlefield conspiring to leave behind slow-moving artillery units – either on the advance, or more dangerously, in retreat. Artillery units were particularly vulnerable to assault by light cavalry, which were frequently used in this role. Only with a number of further inventions (such as the limber, hitched to the trail of a wheeled artillery piece equipped with trunnions), did the concept of field artillery really take off.\\\n\nThe medieval Ming dynasty Chinese invented mobile battlefield artillery during the early part of the fourteenth century at the time when gunpowder and the primordial cannon were first being adopted in the West. One of the earliest documented uses of field artillery is found in the 14th-century Ming Dynasty treatise \"Huolongjing\". The text describes a Chinese cannon called a \"thousand ball thunder cannon\", manufactured of bronze and fastened with wheels. The book also describes another mobile form of artillery called a \"barbarian attacking cannon\" consisting of a cannon attached to a two-wheel carriage.\n\nBefore field artillery batteries generally fired directly at visible targets measured in distances of meters and yards. Today, modern field batteries measure targets in kilometers and miles and often do not directly engage the enemy with observed direct fire. The hundredfold increase in the range of artillery guns in the 20th century has been the result of development of rifled cannons, improvements in propellants, better communications between observer and gunner, and technical improvements in gunnery computational abilities.\n\nMost field artillery situations require indirect fire due to weather, terrain, night-time conditions, distance, or other obstacles. These gunners can also rely upon a trained artillery observer, also called a forward observer, who sees the target and relays the coordinates of the target to their fire direction center, which in turn translates those coordinates into: a left-right aiming direction; an elevation angle; a calculated number of bags of propellant; and finally a fuze with a determined waiting time before exploding (if necessary) to be set, which is then mated to the artillery projectile now ready to be fired.\n\nModern field artillery (i.e. post-World War I) has three distinct sections: All batteries have a Fire Support Man (Forward Observer), Fire Direction Control (FDC), and Cannoners (Gunner).\n\nThe FOs are forward with the infantry (in support role) where they can see the targets and Call For Fire (CFF) upon them. They call the FDC on the radio and transmit a request for fire in the format of CFF. The FDC calculates the CFF and send a deflection and elevation to the gun line. The gun line cranks the specified elevation and deflection on the howitzers, punch the artillery shell followed by the bag (powder). Depending on the CFF, the gunline will fire the round when they are ready or when the FO calls and tells them to fire. The FO spots the round and sends a correction back to the FDC and the process starts all over again until its done.\n\nThe batteries are many kilometres behind the FLOT (Forward Line of Troops). They plan a location where they can be Fire Capability for some certain amount of time and do multiple fire missions before needing to displace.\n\nIn normal operations the FOs locate targets and transmits the CFF to the FDCs.\n\nThey can also calculate \"defensive fire\" tasks. These are pre‑planned missions, typically just in front of or upon one's own positions, designed with the intention of either suppressing potential attacks (where fire is dropped just in front of a friendly position), or in dropping fire on a recently abandoned or overrun position to prevent the enemy from consolidating there. Because the calculations have already been done, the fire can be called down very quickly when it is needed.\n\nThe advance party consists of the battery commander, his driver, first sergeant, gunnery sergeant, FDC guide, gun guides, and communications representatives. Initially the Party looks to find suitable positions for an artillery unit to perform fire missions from. Then they perform what is known as route reconnaissance. The primary purpose of this reconnaissance is to determine the suitability of the route of the units movement. Items to be analyzed include possible alternate routes, cover, concealment, location of obstacles, likely ambush sites, contaminated areas, route marking requirements, and the time and distance required to traverse the route. Several factors are taken into consideration. Once a location is determined and having arrived at the new position the advance party conducts a security sweep and prepares the position for occupation. The purpose of the advance party security with METT-T and the absence of enemy troops, mines, booby traps, NBC hazards, and so on. If these threats or conditions are present in the proposed position area, the advance party breaks contact with any enemy forces or marks minefield and hazards and moves on to find another position area. The battery commander can coordinate for additional assets, or augment the advance party with internal assets, to provide the additional ability to clear areas of small enemy forces, obstacles, and minefields. Natural cover must be used to the maximum. Security is continuous throughout advance party operations. Once a location is determined to be safe the advance party prepares the position for eventual howitzer emplacement. This consists of several procedures such as escorting each howitzer to its prepared position, setting up communications, providing the unit with its initial azimuth of fire, and providing each gun with an initial deflection. In the case of the U.S. Army, this entire process is covered in U.S. Army Field Manual 6-50 Chapter 2.\n\nBecause artillery is an indirect fire weapon, the forward observer (FO) must take up a position where he can observe the target using tools such as binoculars and laser rangefinders and call back fire missions on his radio or telephone.\n\nThe FO usually establishes a covered and concealed observation post (OP) on the ground, from which he can see the enemy. However, he may also be airborne—this was one of the very first uses of aircraft in World War I. He must take great care not to be observed by the enemy, especially if in a static position. Discovery of an FO does not only jeopardize his personal safety; it also hampers the ability of the battery to lay fire.\n\nUsing a standardized format, the FO sends map references and bearing to target, a brief target description, a recommended munition to use, and any special instructions such as \"danger close\" (the warning that friendly troops are within 600 meters of the target when using artillery, requiring extra precision from the guns).\n\nThe FO and the battery iteratively \"walk\" the fire onto the target. The Fire Direction Center (FDC) signals the FO that they have fired and the FO knows to observe fall of shot. He then signals corrections. These are normally of the form of left/right of the bearing line and distance along it, for example \"right 50 add 100\" (distance in meters). When the fire is good enough the FO signals \"target on, fire for effect\".\n\nIf the mission requires a walking barrage, he may continue sending correction orders.\n\nThe FO may be called upon to direct fire for close air support and/or naval artillery in addition to field artillery based howitzer and infantry-embedded mortar units. The U.S. Army Field Manual describing the duties and responsibilities is FM 6‑30, \"Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Observed Fire\".\n\nTypically, there is one FDC for a battery of six guns, in a light division. In a typical heavy division configuration, there exist two FDC elements capable of operating two four-gun sections, also known as a split battery. The FDC computes firing data—fire direction—for the guns. The process consists of determining the precise target location based on the observer's location if needed, then computing range and direction to the target from the guns' location. These data can be computed manually, using special protractors and slide rules with precomputed firing data. Corrections can be added for conditions such as a difference between target and howitzer altitudes, propellant temperature, atmospheric conditions, and even the curvature and rotation of the Earth. In most cases, some corrections are omitted, sacrificing accuracy for speed. In recent decades, FDCs have become computerized, allowing for much faster and more accurate computation of firing data. The FDC at the battalion level is responsible for recording friendly and enemy positions, tracking available battery munitions, and determining the optimal response for engaging a target identified by the FO.\n\nIn most Artillery Batteries the Command Post (CP) controls the firing of the guns. It is usually located at the battery center so as to be able to communicate easily with the guns. The CP should be well camouflaged, but the CPO (Command Post Officer) should be able to see all the guns with ease. Gun markers are sometimes placed in front of the CP to remind the CPO which gun is in which position. The CPO is assisted by two \"Acks\"—i.e., assistants—who operate the fire data computers. The GPO (Gun Position Officer) and CPO work at the plotter to ensure that the data calculated by the Acks is accurate and safe. The CP signaller is contact with the OP, or Observation Post, where the Forward Observer Officer (FOO), works with the OP team to identify targets and call-back fire data. In recent years headset radios have become common for communication between the CPO and gun detachment commanders.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is the firing unit itself. The FDC will transmit a warning order to the guns, followed by orders specifying the type of ammunition and fuze setting, bearing, elevation, and the method of adjustment or orders for fire for effect (FFE). Elevation (vertical direction) and bearing orders are specified in mils, and any special instructions, such as to wait for the observer's command to fire relayed through the FDC. The crews load the howitzers and traverse and elevate the barrel to the required point, using either hand cranks (usually on towed guns) or hydraulics (on self-propelled models).\n\nFire aimed at disabling or destroying enemy guns is known as counter-battery fire.\n\nRemoving the threat posed by enemy artillery is an important objective on the battlefield. Most of the time enemy batteries are too far away for the infantry to engage, so it falls to artillery to do this job.\n\nThe battery uses a variety of techniques to calculate the position of the enemy battery, then can lay fire upon it. If possible, a FO can access a position to call fire on enemy guns directly; either on the ground or in the air, or a battery can be located using counter-battery radar, which can be used to observe the fall of enemy shells and thus calculate their trajectory. A correctly calculated trajectory will reveal the location from which the shell was fired, which information can then be passed on to a friendly battery command post as a fire mission.\n\nTo defend against counter battery fire there are two points of attack: either remove the enemy's ability to observe or make his observations irrelevant/obsolete.\n\nTo remove the ability to observe one must attack the observation assets. Because most counter-battery radar is active, the location can be determined electronically from listening to the beams. If one suspects one's position is being observed by a covert FO then a mission, either artillery or infantry, will be raised to deal with this threat.\n\nAlternatively one can choose to make their observations obsolete by repeatedly moving the guns: hence self-propelled guns.\n\nOrdinary towed guns can take a while to emplace and re-limber and are not armoured, so they are vulnerable to counter battery fire and take a while to engage when at a new location.\n\nSelf-propelled guns do not suffer from these restrictions. They can drive up, drop their trails, fire and move on. Because of their armour they are less vulnerable to counter-battery fire. However, this armor is light by comparison to that of a tank, so it protects only from light fire (e.g., machine guns) and shrapnel.\n\nAnother disadvantage of self-propelled guns is that they tend to be equipped with lighter, less accurate guns. Depending on the nature of the battle being fought, either or both of these drawbacks could prove a severe restriction. However, this is not necessarily true of modern self-propelled guns such as the German PzH 2000. This has a 155 mm main armament that can with assisted firing charges reach 60 km, has a maximum speed of 67 km/h (41 mph) on road surface and 45 km/h (28 mph) off-road, and has a fully computerised fire-control system that enables it to fire-move-fire before the enemy can pin it down for counter-battery fire. It has a rate of fire of 10 rounds per minute.\n\nFDCs also exist in the next higher parent battalion that \"owns\" two to four artillery batteries. Once again, an FDC exists at the U.S. Army brigade or USMC regimental level that \"owns\" the battalions. These higher level FDCs monitor the fire missions of their subordinate units and will coordinate the use of multiple batteries or even multiple battalions in what is called a battalion or brigade/regimental mission. In training and wartime exercises, as many as 72 guns from 3 battalions may all be coordinated to put \"steel on the target\" in what is called a \"brigade/regimental time on target\" or brigade/regimental TOT for short. The rule is \"silence is consent\", meaning that if the lower unit does not hear a \"cancel the mission\" (don't shoot) or even a \"check firing\" (cease firing) order from the higher monitoring unit, then the mission goes on. Higher level units monitor their subordinate unit's missions both for active as well as passive purposes. Higher-level units may also get involved to coordinate artillery fire across fire support coordination boundaries (often parallel lines on maps) where one unit can not fire into without permission from higher and/or adjacent units that \"own\" the territory.\n\n\n"}

It appeared in early November 1572 and was independently discovered by many individuals.\n\nThe remnant of the supernova has been observed optically but was first detected at radio wavelengths; it is often known as 3C 10, a radio-source designation, although increasingly as Tycho's supernova remnant.\n\nThe appearance of the Milky Way supernova of 1572 belongs among the more important observation events in the history of astronomy. The appearance of the \"new star\" helped to revise ancient models of the heavens and to speed on a revolution in astronomy that began with the realisation of the need to produce better astrometric star catalogues (and thus the need for more precise astronomical observing instruments). It also challenged the Aristotelian dogma of the unchangeability of the realm of stars.\n\nThe supernova of 1572 is often called \"Tycho's supernova\", because of Tycho Brahe's extensive work \"De nova et nullius aevi memoria prius visa stella\" (\"Concerning the Star, new and never before seen in the life or memory of anyone\", published in 1573 with reprints overseen by Johannes Kepler in 1602, and 1610), a work containing both Tycho Brahe's own observations and the analysis of sightings from many other observers. Tycho was not the first to observe the 1572 supernova, although he was probably the most accurate observer of the object. Almost as accurate were his European colleagues, such as Wolfgang Schuler, Thomas Digges, John Dee, Francesco Maurolico, Jerónimo Muñoz, Tadeáš Hájek, or Bartholomäus Reisacher.\n\nIn England, Queen Elizabeth had the mathematician and astrologer Thomas Allen, come and visit \"to have his advice about the new Star that appeared in the Cassiopeia to which he gave his Judgement very learnedly\", as the antiquary John Aubrey recorded in his memoranda a century later.\n\nIn Ming dynasty China, the star became an issue between Zhang Juzheng and the young Wanli Emperor: in accordance with the cosmological tradition, the emperor was warned to consider his misbehavior, since the new star was interpreted as an evil omen.\n\nThe more reliable contemporary reports state that the new star itself burst forth soon after November 2, and by November 11 it was already brighter than Jupiter. Around November 16, 1572, it reached its peak brightness at about magnitude −4.0, with some descriptions giving it as equal to Venus when that planet was at its brightest. The supernova remained visible to the naked eye into early 1574, gradually fading until it disappeared from view.\n\nThe supernova was classified as type I on the basis of its historical light curve soon after type I and type II supernovae were first defined on the basis of their spectra. The X-ray spectrum of the remnant showed that it was almost certainly of type Ia, but its exact classification continued to be debated until the detection of a light echo in 2008 gave final confirmation that it is a normal type Ia.\n\nThe classification as a type Ia supernova of normal luminosity allows an accurate measure of the distance to SN 1572. The peak absolute magnitude can be calculated from the B-band decline rate to be . Given estimates of the peak apparent magnitude and the known extinction of magnitudes, the distance is kpc.\n\nThe distance to the supernova remnant has been estimated to between 2 and 5 kpc (approx. 6,500 and 16,300 light-years), with recent studies suggesting a narrower range of 2.5 and 3 kpc (approx. 8,000 and 9,800 light-years).\n\nThe search for a supernova remnant was negative until 1952, when Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard reported a radio detection at 158.5 MHz, obtained at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. This was confirmed, and its position more accurately measured in 1957 by Baldwin and Edge using the Cambridge Radio Telescope working at a wavelength of . The remnant was also identified tentatively in the second Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources as object \"2C 34,\" and more firmly as \"3C 10\" in the third Cambridge list (Edge et al. 1959). There is no dispute that 3C 10 is the remnant of the supernova observed in 1572–1573. Following a 1964 review article by Minkowski, the designation 3C 10 appears to be that most commonly used in the literature when referring to the radio remnant of B Cas, although some authors use the tabulated Galactic designation G120.7+2.1 and many authors commonly refer to it as \"Tycho's supernova remnant\". Because the radio remnant was reported before the optical supernova-remnant wisps were discovered, the designation 3C 10 is used by some to signify the remnant at all wavelengths.\nAn X-ray source designated Cepheus X-1 (or Cep X-1) was detected by the Uhuru X-ray observatory at 4U 0022+63. Earlier catalog designations are X120+2 and XRS 00224+638. Cepheus X-1 is actually in the constellation Cassiopeia, and it is SN 1572, the Tycho SNR.\n\nThe supernova remnant of B Cas was discovered in the 1960s by scientists with a Palomar Mountain telescope as a very faint nebula. It was later photographed by a telescope on the international ROSAT spacecraft. The supernova has been confirmed as Type Ia, in which a white dwarf star has accreted matter from a companion until it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit and explodes. This type of supernova does not typically create the spectacular nebula more typical of Type II supernovas, such as SN 1054 which created the Crab Nebula. A shell of gas is still expanding from its center at about 9,000 km/s. A recent study indicates a rate of expansion below 5,000 km/s.\n\nIn October 2004, a letter in \"Nature\" reported the discovery of a G2 star, similar in type to our own Sun and named Tycho G. It is thought to be the companion star that contributed mass to the white dwarf that ultimately resulted in the supernova. A subsequent study, published in March 2005, revealed further details about this star: Tycho G was probably a main-sequence star or subgiant before the explosion, but some of its mass was stripped away and its outer layers were shock-heated by the supernova. Tycho G's current velocity is perhaps the strongest evidence that it was the companion star to the white dwarf, as it is traveling at a rate of 136 km/s, which is more than four times faster than the mean velocity of other stars in its stellar neighbourhood.\nThis find has been challenged in recent years. The star is relatively far away from the center and does not show rotation which might be expected of a companion star.\n\nIn Gaia DR2, the star was calculated to be light-years away, on the lower end of SN 1572's possible range of distances, which in turn lowered the calculated velocity from 136 km/s to only 56 km/s.\n\nIn the ninth episode of James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", Stephen Dedalus associates the appearance of the supernova with the youthful William Shakespeare, and in the November 1998 issue of \"Sky & Telescope\", three researchers from Southwest Texas State University, Don Olson and Russell Doescher of the Physics Department and Marilynn Olson of the English Department, argued that this supernova is described in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", specifically by Bernardo in Act I, Scene i.\n\nThe supernova inspired the poem \"Al Aaraaf\" by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nThe protagonist in Arthur C. Clarke's 1955 short story \"The Star\" casually mentions the supernova. It is a major element in Frederik Pohl's spoof science article, \"The Martian Star-Gazers\", first published in \"Galaxy Science Fiction Magazine\" in 1962.\n\n\n"}

When two flies are found buzzing around his comically oversized penis, he shoots at them, causing the penis to detach and run in fear. Harton calls his penis back and begins looking around, watching dogs, snakes and birds all having sex and a woman masturbating. He puts a wheel underneath his now-hard penis and heads toward the woman. She asks Harton to lick her nipples, which he does; as he does, the nipple begins squirting breast milk, which Harton swallows. Meanwhile, the woman's vagina comes to life and starts fondling Harton's penis, and Harton begins the act of penetration—only to find that he cannot get his penis in, since her vagina is full of junk. Once he clears that out, he penetrates several times before being bit by a crab, which causes the penis to again detach, shriek in pain and run off. Harton runs after the penis, which finally rids itself of the crab by ejaculating on it and reattaches.\n\nSeeing the head of another beautiful woman sticking out from a pile of sand, Harton jumps on it and immediately starts humping it—only to realize he has inadvertently given anal to an old man already on top of the woman. Harton attempts to run away, but his penis is stuck in the old man's rectum, causing the old man to be dragged along behind. After some effort, he gets the penis out and hammers it straight.\n\nFrom there, Harton witnesses a farmer having sex with his donkey and challenges the farmer to a sword fight between their penises; Harton bites the other's penis, which goes limp. As Harton makes his move on the donkey, it runs away, causing Harton's penis to get hair stuck in it.\n\nIn resignation, he sticks his penis into a fence hole, where a cow begins to lick the penis as the cartoon ends.\n\nSupposedly, U.S. film labs refused to process the film, and it had to be developed in Cuba. The artists are unknown, but a widespread rumor states that a group of famous animators created the film for a private party in honor of Winsor McCay. Disney animator Ward Kimball gave the following account of the history of the short:\nThe first porno-cartoon was made in New York. It was called \"Eveready Harton\" and was made in the late 1920s, silent, of course—by three studios. Each one did a section of it without telling the other studios what they were doing. Studio A finished the first part and gave the last drawing to Studio B [...] Involved were Max Fleischer, Paul Terry and the Mutt and Jeff studio. They didn't see the finished product till the night of the big show. A couple of guys who were there tell me the laughter almost blew the top off the hotel where they were screening it.\n\nWhen a copy of the short was screened in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the program notes attributed the animation to George Stalling, George Canata, Rudy Zamora, Sr., and Walter Lantz. The short circulated informally, shown only at small underground festivals or parties, until 2002 when it was included in the theatrically released compilation \"The Good Old Naughty Days\".\n\n\n"}

Steenrod constructed stable operations\n\nfor all formula_16 greater than zero. The notation formula_17 and their name, the Steenrod squares, comes from the fact that formula_18 restricted to classes of degree formula_19 is the cup square. There are analogous operations for odd primary coefficients, usually denoted formula_20 and called the reduced formula_1-th power operations:\n\nThe formula_23 generate a connected graded algebra over formula_24, where the multiplication is given by composition of operations. This is the mod 2 Steenrod algebra. In the case formula_25, the mod formula_1 Steenrod algebra is generated by the formula_20 and the Bockstein operation formula_28 associated to the short exact sequence\n\nIn the case formula_7, the Bockstein element is formula_31 and the reduced formula_1-th power formula_20 is formula_34.\n\n showed that the Steenrod squares formula_35 are characterized by the following 5 axioms:\n\n\nIn addition the Steenrod squares have the following properties: \n\nSimilarly the following axioms characterize the reduced formula_1-th powers for formula_25.\n\n\nAs before, the reduced \"p\"-th powers also satisfy Ádem relations and commute with the suspension and boundary operators.\n\nThe Ádem relations for formula_7 were conjectured by and established by . They are given by\n\nfor all formula_62 such that formula_63. (The binomial coefficients are to be interpreted mod 2.) The Ádem relations allow one to write an arbitrary composition of Steenrod squares as a sum of Serre–Cartan basis elements.\n\nFor odd formula_1 the Ádem relations are\nfor \"a\"<\"pb\" and\nfor formula_67.\n\n reformulated the Ádem relations as the following identities.\n\nFor formula_7 put\nthen the Ádem relations are equivalent to \n\nFor formula_25 put\nthen the Ádem relations are equivalent to the statement that \nis symmetric in formula_74 and formula_75. Here formula_28 is the Bockstein operation and formula_77.\n\nThe Steenrod operations for real projective space can be readily computed using the formal properties of the Steenrod squares. Recall that\n\nwhere formula_79 For the operations on formula_80 we know that\n\nUsing the operation\n\nwe note that the Cartan relation implies that\n\nis a ring morphism. Hence\n\nSince there is only one degree formula_85 component of the previous sum, we have that\n\nSuppose that formula_87 is any degree formula_19 subgroup of the symmetric group on formula_19 points, formula_90 a cohomology class in formula_91, formula_92 an abelian group acted on by formula_87, and formula_94 a cohomology class in formula_95. showed how to construct a reduced power formula_96 in formula_97, as follows.\n\n\nThe Steenrod squares and reduced powers are special cases of this construction where formula_87 is a cyclic group of prime order formula_115 acting as a cyclic permutation of formula_19 elements, and the groups formula_92 and formula_118 are cyclic of order formula_1, so that formula_113 is also cyclic of order formula_1.\n\n (for formula_7) and (for formula_9) described the structure of the Steenrod algebra of stable mod formula_1 cohomology operations, showing that it is generated by the Bockstein homomorphism together with the Steenrod reduced powers, and the Ádem relations generate the ideal of relations between these generators. In particular they found an explicit basis for the Steenrod algebra. This basis relies on a certain notion of admissibility for integer sequences. We say a sequence\n\nis admissible if for each formula_126, we have that formula_127. Then the elements\n\nwhere formula_129 is an admissible sequence, form a basis (the Serre–Cartan basis) for the mod 2 Steenrod algebra. There is a similar basis for the case formula_9 consisting of the elements\n\nsuch that\n\nThe Steenrod algebra has more structure than a graded formula_136-algebra. It is also a Hopf algebra, so that in particular there is a diagonal or comultiplication map\n\ninduced by the Cartan formula for the action of the Steenrod algebra on the cup product.\nIt is easier to describe than the product map, and is given by\n\nThese formulas imply that the Steenrod algebra is co-commutative.\n\nThe linear dual of formula_141 makes the (graded) linear dual formula_142 of \"A\" into an algebra. proved, for formula_143, that formula_142 is a polynomial algebra, with one generator formula_145 of degree formula_146, for every \"k\", and for formula_25 the dual Steenrod algebra formula_142 is the tensor product of the polynomial algebra in generators formula_145 of degree formula_150 formula_151 and the exterior algebra in generators τ of degree formula_152 formula_153. The monomial basis for formula_142 then gives another choice of basis for \"A\", called the Milnor basis. The dual to the Steenrod algebra is often more convenient to work with, because the multiplication is (super) commutative. The comultiplication for formula_142 is the dual of the product on \"A\"; it is given by\n\nThe only primitive elements of \"A\" for \"p\"=2 are the formula_158, and these are dual to the formula_159 (the only indecomposables of \"A\").\n\nThe dual Steenrod algebras are supercommutative Hopf algebras, so their spectra are algebra supergroup schemes. These group schemes are closely related to the automorphisms of 1-dimensional additive formal groups. For example, if \"p\"=2 then the dual Steenrod algebra is the group scheme of automorphisms of the 1-dimensional additive formal group scheme \"x\"+\"y\" that are the identity to first order. These automorphisms are of the form \n\n gave the following algebraic construction of the Steenrod algebra over a finite field formula_161 of order \"q\". If \"V\" is a vector space over formula_161 then write \"SV\" for the symmetric algebra of \"V\". There is an algebra homomorphism \n\nwhere \"F\" is the Frobenius endomorphism of \"SV\". If we put\n\nor \n\nfor formula_166 then if \"V\" is infinite dimensional the elements formula_167 generate an algebra isomorphism to the subalgebra of the Steenrod algebra generated by the reduced \"p′\"th powers for \"p\" odd, or the even Steenrod squares formula_168 for formula_143.\n\nThe most famous early applications of the Steenrod algebra to outstanding topological problems were the solutions by J. Frank Adams of the Hopf invariant one problem and the vector fields on spheres problem. Independently Milnor and Raoul Bott, as well as Michel Kervaire, gave a second solution of the Hopf invariant one problem, using operations in K-theory; these are the Adams operations. One application of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra that is fairly elementary is the following theorem.\n\nTheorem. If there is a map formula_170 of Hopf invariant one, then \"n\" is a power of 2.\n\nThe proof uses the fact that each formula_171 is decomposable for \"k\" which is not a power of 2; that is, such an element is a product of squares of strictly smaller degree.\n\nThe cohomology of the Steenrod algebra is the formula_172 term for the (\"p\"-local) Adams spectral sequence, whose abutment is the \"p\"-component of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. More specifically, the formula_172 term of this spectral sequence may be identified as\n\nThis is what is meant by the aphorism \"the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra is an approximation to the stable homotopy groups of spheres.\"\n\n\n"}

It is a parasite of plants, and it is a pest of many agricultural crops. It is an especially important pest of bananas and citrus, and it can be found on coconut, avocado, coffee, sugarcane, other grasses, and ornamentals. It is a migratory endoparasite of roots, causing lesions that form cankers. Infected plants experience malnutrition.\n\nThe nematode was first described from necrotic tissue in a species of \"Musa\", the banana genus, in 1891. It is one of the most important root pathogens of banana crops, causing yield losses of up to 30 to 60% in many countries. It is known in temperate regions worldwide.\n\nAdults and juveniles are vermiform in shape. Adults are sexually dimorphic. The male has a poorly developed stylet, a knob-like head, and a sharp, curved spicule enclosed in a sac. The male is 500 to 600 µm in length, while the female is about 550 to 880 µm long. The female has a well-developed stylet. Both male and female have long, tapered tails with rounded or indented ends.\n\nThe nematode completes its life cycle in about 21 days at 25 °C.\n\nThe nematode causes a disease condition called toppling or blackhead disease in plants. In bananas they weaken the anchor roots and the plants can fall. The roots also fail to supply the plant with water and nutrients, causing reduced growth and development.\n\nThe nematode load in the soil can be reduced with fumigation and crop rotation. Cover crops that are not susceptible to the nematode, such as \"Crotalaria\" or \"Tagetes\", can be sown. Disease-free sprouts raised from clean tissue cultures can be used.\n\nIt is notable as an early exemplar, along with \"Radopholus arabocoffeae\", of the alternative flatworm mitochondrial code.\n\n"}

Much of modern hydrobiology can be viewed as a sub-discipline of ecology but the sphere of hydrobiology includes taxonomy, economic biology, industrial biology, morphology, physiology etc. The one distinguishing aspect is that all relate to aquatic organisms. Much work is closely related to limnology and can be divided into lotic system ecology (flowing waters) and lentic system ecology (still waters).\n\nOne of the significant areas of current research is eutrophication. Special attention is paid to biotic interactions in plankton assemblage including the microbial loop, the mechanism of influencing water blooms, phosphorus load and lake turnover. Another subject of research is the acidification of mountain lakes. Long-term studies are carried out on changes in the ionic composition of the water of rivers, lakes and reservoirs in connection with acid rain and fertilisation. One goal of current research is elucidation of the basic environmental functions of the ecosystem in reservoirs, which are important for water quality management and water supply.\n\nMuch of the early work of hydrobiologists concentrated on the biological processes utilised in sewage treatment and water purification especially slow sand filters. Other historically important work sought to provide biotic indices for classifying waters according to the biotic communities that they supported. This work continues to this day in Europe in the development of classification tools for assessing water bodies for the EU water framework directive.\n\nThe hydrobiologist technician conducts field analysis. It identifies plants and living species, locates them, counts them. It identifies pollutions and nuisances that can affect the aquatic fauna and flora. He takes the samples and writes a report of his observations.\n\nThe hydrobiologist engineer intervenes more in the process of the study. It defines the intervention protocols, the samples to be taken. He plans and programs the study campaigns and then summarizes his results.

The bank provides micro loans of about $60 each to the poor, as well as promoting a social charter that gave the film its title.\n\nThe film was Gayle Ferraro's first, begun in 1997 and completed in 2000. It has been shown at multiple film festivals, including the 2001 New York International Independent Film and Video Festival and 2002 Women With Vision Film Festival. It won the Bronze Award for Women's Issues at the Houston Worldfest, and was broadcast by PBS in 2003 \n\nSixteen Decisions is filmed in an experimental style, skipping between past, present, and future to follow the life of a teenager named Selina. A sixteen-year-old mother of two, Selina lives a life typical for poor women in Bangladesh. She was a child laborer at the age of seven, married at the age of twelve, and had her first child at the age of thirteen. Her family sold their land to pay her dowry, and when her father lost his sight, they were left beggars. The $60 loan she receives from Grameen Bank allows her to put the down payment on a bicycle rickshaw and buy chickens whose eggs she can sell. The film shows group meetings where community members recite the Sixteen Decisions that Grameen Bank uses to improve the lives of those it loans to and help ensure that the people are able to repay these loans.\n\nThe founder of Grameen Bank, Muhammad Yunus, is a former Fulbright Scholar from Bangladesh. He is known for developing the concept of providing small loans to entrepreneurs who would not qualify for bank loans, in a practice called microcredit. At the time of the documentary, he had loaned $2 million to ten million women, with a repayment rate of 99%. He has continued his campaign against poverty with the co-founding of Grameen America, which Gayle Ferraro documented in the follow-up film \"To Catch a Dollar\". Yunus's dedication to battling global poverty earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, and he has declared that his mission is to \"help create a world free of poverty.\n\nIt took Gayle Ferraro three trips to Bangladesh to make \"Sixteen Decisions\". She self-financed both the travel and the production, taking her friend Rebecca Boylan to help as a camera person. It was released as an independent film by Ferraro's film company, Aerial Production, after which it was taken around the country to art cinemas and special interest groups.\n\nOne of the foundations of Grameen Bank is its charter, which contains sixteen decisions that are recited during group meetings. The decisions are:\n\n1. We shall follow and advance the four principles of Discipline, Unity, Courage, and Hard work in all walks of our lives.\n\n2. We shall bring prosperity to our families.\n\n3. We shall repair our homes and work towards constructing new houses.\n\n4. We shall grow vegetables all year round. We shall eat plenty of them and sell the surplus.\n\n5. We shall plant as many seedlings as possible during the plantation seasons.\n\n6. We shall plan to keep our families small, minimize our expenditures, and look after our health.\n\n7. We shall educate our children and ensure that they can earn to pay for their education.\n\n8. We shall keep our children and our environment clean.\n\n9. We shall build and use latrines.\n\n10.

Growing up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Robinson graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and went on to play point guard for the University of Michigan. After a strong showing in Michigan's 1989 NCAA championship, Robinson was drafted #10 in the first round of the 1990 NBA Draft.\n\nRobinson was born in Mandeville, Jamaica, in the west-central portion of the island. His mother moved to the Boston area while he was a toddler, leaving him in his grandparents' care. Shortly after he turned 10 years old, his parents sent him to the United States in hopes of reuniting him with his mother. However, his mother made it clear that she didn't want him, and he was reduced to sleeping in apartment halls and Harvard College dorm stairways.\n\nEarly in the 1977-78 school year, he was taken in by Helen and Lou Ford, a respected local couple. They adopted him in 1978. He blossomed into a star guard at CRLS, leading them to a state championship in 1986.\n\nRobinson averaged 14.3 points and 5.7 assists during his collegiate career at the University of Michigan. He achieved fame during his junior year for sinking two crucial free throws with 3 seconds left in the 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship to win the game for the Wolverines over Seton Hall University. His mother persuaded the city of Cambridge to name her street \"Rumeal Robinson Way\" in his honor.\n\nRobinson was drafted in 1990 by the Atlanta Hawks with the 10th pick. He was signed to a four-year deal with the Hawks. He also played for the New Jersey Nets, Charlotte Hornets, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers. Robinson also spent time in the Continental Basketball Association. He played in the Euroleague during the 2001–02 season for KK Zadar.\n\nIn the NBA, Robinson's play was very inconsistent. His last season as a regular player was 1992-93, his first year in New Jersey; after that year, he never played in more than 54 games a season.\n\nHe was one of three Robinsons that the Portland Trail Blazers had in their line-up for the 1995–96 NBA season. The others were Clifford Robinson and James Robinson (both no relation).\n\nRobinson made some $5 million in the NBA, but spent it on a lavish lifestyle. He went through money so irresponsibly, he neglected to pay his bills. He was forced into bankruptcy in 1998.\n\nAfter his playing career was over, Robinson moved to Miami and attempted to become a property developer in his native Jamaica. He planned to build a 25,000 acre resort in his hometown called Harmony Cove. As part of his bid to attract investors, he persuaded his adoptive mother to take out a second mortgage on her house and lend it to Robinson as seed money. He promised to cover all the payments, and promised to give her $500,000 once the project was finished.\n\nHowever, his high living in the 1990s had all but destroyed his credit, and he was unable to find a bank willing to lend him any money. Through a friend, he was referred to Community State Bank in Ankeny, Iowa. The bank's senior loan officer, Brian Williams, approved a $377,000 bridge loan to Robinson's company, Megaladon Development—ostensibly to help with advertising and business plans. Robinson paid $100,000 of the loan back to Williams as a bribe to move the approval process forward.\n\nOver the next year and a half, Robinson received $1.2 million in loans from Community State Bank, all approved by Williams. However, he never paid the bank a single penny, and barely five percent of the money went toward developing Harmony Cove. The rest of it was used to buy expensive clothes, meals, motorcycles, jewelry, and other items.\n\nThe fraud was uncovered when Williams tried to hide the bad loans by rolling the interest and penalties into the principal for a new loan. One of Williams' subordinates was alarmed enough to alert bank officials. Community State Bank fired Williams and sued Megaladon for nonpayment. In August 2006, Community State Bank won $535,000 in damages. During the proceedings, it emerged that Robinson hadn't paid taxes since his playing days. During depositions to ascertain his net worth, Robinson admitted he had no net worth, and lived on roughly $20 at a time. His only possessions were a change of pants.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, a federal grand jury in Des Moines indicted Robinson, his girlfriend Stephanie Hodge, and Williams for bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank bribery, wire fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Robinson surrendered to authorities on September 4.\n\nSoon after the arrest, his adoptive mother Helen Ford came forward and accused Robinson of swindling her out of her home. Unknown to Ford, Robinson had arranged to sell Ford's house to one of his business partners, Miami foreclosure specialist Rick Preston, for $250,000. Preston later sold the house to another business partner, Jorge Rodriguez, for $600,000. In turn, Rodriguez sold it to Stephen Hodge, the brother of Robinson's girlfriend at the time, for $1 million. The money was ostensibly intended to help build Harmony Cove, but was wasted on lavish spending and paying other debts. While Robinson initially tried to keep up the payments, the mortgage went unserviced for so long that a bank foreclosed on her house in 2007. In 2009, Ford was forced to move out of her home. By this time, Robinson had lost possession of his expensive condo in Aventura, and was living in a squalid, budget motel in North Miami Beach. Ford eventually got her home back in 2013.\n\nOn September 8, 2010, Robinson was convicted on 11 counts of bank bribery, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. On January 7, 2011, federal judge Ronald E. Longstaff sentenced Robinson to 6½ years (78 months) in prison. He was also ordered to pay $1,184,615 million in restitution to Community State Bank and St. Paul Mercury Insurance. Robinson appealed his sentence in September 2011, claiming judge Longstaff had denied him a chance to change lawyers and had improperly taken his allocution statement into account at sentencing.

He was the son of Shaikh Awais Jalayir. Following the execution of his brother Shaikh Hasan Jalayir, the amirs placed Shaikh Hussain Jalayir on the throne. Almost immediately he had to deal with an invasion by his brother-in-law Shah Mahmud of the Muzaffarids of Iran. Shah Mahmud, who was the son-in-law of Shaikh Awais Jalayir, advanced a claim on Tabriz and took the city. Illness, however, forced him to abandon the region. This was followed by an invasion by the leader of the Muzaffarids, Shah Shuja, but despite taking the city, he was also forced to retreat due to a rebellion in Qazvin. It was only in the summer of 1376 that Shaikh Hussain Jalayir took up residence in Tabriz. In the following spring, he undertook a successful campaign against the Black Sheep Turkmen under Bairam Khwaja, who had been raiding from the west.\n\nShaikh Hussain Jalayir's reign was marred by conflict with his surviving brothers; namely, Shaikh Ali Jalayir, Sultan Ahmed Jalayir, and Shaikh Bayazid Jalayir. Shaikh Hussain Jalayir also lost his popularity among many amirs who disliked his support of the powerful 'Adil Aqa, the governor of Ray. Shaikh Hussain Jalayir was faced with a series of uprisings, hostility among his brothers, and troubles with his external enemies. When 'Adil Aqa turned on him, Shaikh Hussain Jalayir lost his last powerful supporter. Sultan Ahmed Jalayir advanced from Arbadil and occupied Tabriz near the end of April 1382; he ordered Husain's execution. Ahmad would then himself take the throne, but conflict between him and 'Adil Aqa and Bayazid meant that the state fell into a period of disunity.\n\n"}

It is \"a stream of violent but extremely learned abuse,\" modeled on a lost poem of the same title by the Greek Alexandrian poet Callimachus.\n\nThe object of the poet's curses is left unnamed except for the pseudonym \"Ibis\", and no scholarly consensus has been reached as to whom this pseudonym might refer to. Hyginus, Cassius Severus, Titus Labienus, Thrasyllus of Mendes, Caninius Rebilus, Ovid's erstwhile friend Sabinus, and the emperor Augustus have all been proposed, as well as the possibility that \"Ibis\" might refer to more than one person, to nobody at all, or even to Ovid's own poetry.\n\nThe 644-line poem, like all Ovid's extant work except the \"Metamorphoses\", is written in elegiac couplets. It is thus an unusual, though not unique, example of invective poetry in antiquity written in elegiac form rather than the more common iambics or hendecasyllabics. The incantatory nature of the curses in the \"Ibis\" has sometimes led to comparisons with curse tablets (\"defixiones\"), though Ovid's are elaborately literary in expression; the poem has also been seen as a type of \"devotio\".\n\nDrawing on the encyclopedic store of knowledge he demonstrated in the \"Metamorphoses\" and his other work — presumably from memory, as he purportedly had few books with him in exile — Ovid threatens his enemy in the second section of the poem (lines 251–638) with a veritable catalogue of \"gruesome and mutually incompatible fates\" that befell various figures from myth and history, ranging from laming and blinding to cannibalism to death by pine cone. Ovid also declares in the poem's opening salvo that even if he dies in exile, his ghost will rise and rend Ibis's flesh.\n\nThe basic structure of the poem is as follows:\n\nThe \"Ibis\" attracted a large number of scholia and was widely disseminated and referenced in Renaissance literature. In his annotated translation (1577), Thomas Underdowne found in \"Ibis\" a reference guide to \"all manner of vices punished, all offenses corrected, and all misdeeds revenged.\" An English translator noted that \"a full reference to each of the allusions to be found in this poem would suffice to fill a small volume.\"\n\nThe \"editio princeps\" of Ovid's complete works, including the \"Ibis\", was published in Italy in 1471. Full-text versions of the following Latin editions and English translations of the \"Ibis\" are available online.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his seminal documentary film \"Afro-Punk\" (2003), exploring the African American experience in the punk and alternative music scene, and co-creating the Afropunk Festival. After the film's release, he curated the Liberation Sessions concert series which promoted black artistry via music and film, and then subsequently co-founded the annual Afropunk Festival in Brooklyn, working with it from 2005 through 2008, and later parting due to philosophical differences with its direction.\n\nSpooner later wrote and directed \"White Lies Black Sheep\" (2007), a fictional feature set within the punk world that premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. He also wrote the foreword for the book anthology \"White Riot\" which examines where race, identity and punk music intersect.\n\nSpooner grew up in the deserts of California, Panama, and the urban sprawl of New York City where he delved into the hardcore punk music scene and engaged in its culture. Later, he trained and produced work as a sculptor with gallery shows in both Seattle and New York. Though bi-racial, Spooner identifies as black. After visiting his family in St. Lucia, Spooner began to explore identity and race which later inspired the themes in his films and art.\n\nDuring his teens and early adulthood, Spooner was part of the predominantly Eurocentric hardcore punk scene, participating in the creation of zines, releasing records via his label, and attending shows. His label, Kidney Room Records, was a DIY punk record label putting out mostly emo-core / straight edge 7 inches. The name originates from the book Animal Liberation in which an animal, suffering from a vivisection experimentation, was referred to as the kidney in room 101. Spooner put out 3 records: Frail - Idle Hands Hold Nothing, Elements of Need/Jasmine split, and The Swing Kids first 7 inch.\n\nDuring his punk years, Spooner grew increasingly fascinated by the absence of dialogue around race among his friends in the scene and the disparity of black punk bands: Mick Collins, Fishbone, Vaginal Davis, and Bad Brains to name a few. Spooner understood punk rock as an offshoot of rock and roll and the pioneering work of black innovators like Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Jimi Hendrix, so he began to navigate why there were few people of color represented in the alternative punk music scene and why his peers did not engage with racial injustice in the way it had with animal rights, drugs/alcohol, feminism, and homophobia. Spooner also did not identify with mainstream media's representations of \"blackness\" and became focused on broadening the spectrum through his films and events by connecting alternative black people in the scene. Furthermore, he wanted to provide a platform for alternative black performers that were sidelined by the mainstream.\n\nSpooner also worked as a prominent DJ in New York City, spinning at AfroPunk events, as well as The Limelight, Black Betty, Enids, Beauty Bar, Spa and the Edison in Los Angeles. He also promoted ON!, a popular mod soul night featuring Djs Daniel Collas of the Phenomenal Handclap Band and Nick Marc of TisWas. He also DJ'ed at SPA and promoted the long running Wednesday night parties \"Shattered\" and \"SMF\" featuring hip hop dj's spinning soul music.\n\nSpooner's documentary film, AfroPunk, explores race identity and the black experience in the alternative punk scene --then overwhelmingly white and taking place as the world shifted with the galvanizing power of the internet. Spooner's investigation into the untold stories of disaffected black youth and the black punk experience via film lead to the emergence of the Afropunk Festival, and gave a voice to alternative black youth who felt they did not fit into stereotypical notions of black identity propagated by the media.\n\n\"AfroPunk\" traces the experiences of a variety of black punks throughout the United States. In the DIY tradition, Spooner toured the film across the country like a band, screening it over 300 times at college campuses and film festivals. He amassed a devoted cult following, largely among minority punks who were active on a message board within his website afropunk.com. Through continued collected interest and participation from the film's followers, the film was a catalyst for a cultural black movement that lead to the AfroPunk Festivals (2005 to present). He discontinued participation in the festival after repeated conflicts with his partner.\n\nSpooner also curated the film and music component of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's African Arts Festival and was the recipient of the ReNew Media Rockefeller Grant. He later wrote and directed a feature film entitled \"White Lies Black Sheep\" (2007), a fictional drama set in New York City's nightlife circa early 2000s. Both of his films premiered at national and international film festivals, including Toronto International Film Festival. , The American Black Film Festival, Festival International de Cine de Mar del Plata, Milan International Film Festival, and garnered various awards such as Best Documentary at Jamerican International Film Fest. Later in 2008, Spooner directed a \"Rock The Vote\" commercial featuring Henry Rollins and produced various spots for Brave New Films. His work has been recounted in various publications, including NPR, Vice Magazine, The Village Voice, The New Yorker, Vibe, Fader Magazine, MTV, NBC News and Variety.\n\nUpon his move to Los Angeles, Spooner taught himself to build bikes and began a monthly bike ride entitled \"Freedom Ride: Black Kids On Bikes\" that rode through predominantly black neighborhoods , but also made a statement with rides through wealthy white neighborhoods.\n\nSpooner is currently a tattoo artist at Monocle Tattoo Los Angeles, where he pioneered vegan friendly tattooing. He is presently working on his first graphic novel, and he is co-curator for the Broad Museum's Summer Happenings. Spooner continues to screen AfroPunk at colleges around the country and gives talks on the punk ethos and black identity. He also posts via Instagram @spoonersnofun.\n\n"}

It ceased operation on December 31, 2009, after being amalgamated with Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation (ECBC).\n\nDEVCO was organized primarily into two divisions: a community economic development organization, and the coal division.\n\nFrom March 30, 1968, until November 23, 2001, DEVCO's coal division operated Canada's largest underground coal mines, located in eastern Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia. Following decommissioning of its mines, DEVCO sold all non-mining surface assets to the private sector on December 18, 2001, including the Devco Railway and is now remediating its mine sites.\n\nIn 1965, the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, or DOSCO (then a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group) announced that its mines had only 15 years of production left and concluded that the expense of opening new underground mines in the Sydney Coal Field would be too expensive. The company made its intentions clear that it would be exiting the coal mining business within months.\n\nIn response to a vast public outcry in industrial Cape Breton County, the minority government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson announced J.R. Donald would head a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Cape Breton coal industry, with hearings held in 1965 and 1966. The Donald Commission recommended that a federal Crown corporation be established to acquire and manage DOSCO's coal operations, with the aim being to slowly wean the Sydney area economy off the coal industry.\n\nOn July 7, 1967, the Cape Breton Development Corporation, or DEVCO, was established to operate the mines in the interim, while phasing them out throughout the 1970s and, at the same time, develop new economic opportunities for the surrounding communities. On March 30, 1968, DEVCO expropriated DOSCO's coal mines and the Sydney and Louisburg Railway, settling for a payment of $12 million. At the same time, the Government of Nova Scotia took over the operation of DOSCO's integrated steel mill in Sydney, renaming the operation Sydney Steel Corporation, or SYSCO.\n\nDEVCO had several operating divisions, including its Coal Division, as well as economic development divisions, intended to help the Industrial Cape Breton area diversify its economy from an over-reliance on the coal and steel industries.\n\nInitially, DEVCO focused on operating the coal mines throughout the Sydney Coal Field that it had inherited from DOSCO, while attempting to invest in other initiatives such as establishing a post-secondary education institution in the area (what would become the University College of Cape Breton, now Cape Breton University), tourism developments, industrial parks for non-coal/steel related manufacturing industries, and investing in small area businesses and community infrastructure projects to help unemployed coal miners and steel workers who had been laid off during the 1960s drawdown in production.\n\nOne of DEVCO's first tourism-related developments in the early 1970s was the Cape Breton Steam Railway, a joint project with the Sydney and Louisburg Railway Historical Society, which saw unused Devco Railway tracks between Glace Bay and Port Morien used for operating a tourist railway, with coal-powered steam locomotives. The project ran until it proved to be uneconomic to operate by the late 1970s.\n\nOverall, until 1973, DEVCO was more-or-less focused on continuing the operation of its former-DOSCO mines and railway, while providing new economic growth for the region.\n\nThe October 1973 Yom Kippur War and the ensuing 1973 oil crisis led the federal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to re-examine all Canadian energy production, including the nationalization of Alberta oil, as well as an expansion of DEVCO coal production, reversing the recommendation of the 1966 Donald Commission to phase out coal production and diversify the economy of Industrial Cape Breton. The Trudeau government sought to use its ownership of DEVCO to reverse Nova Scotia's reliance on the importation of foreign oil for generating electricity; approximately 70% of the province's electricity was generated by foreign oil by the late 1970s.\n\nNew mines were built and opened near New Waterford (Phalen and Lingan collieries) and at the northeastern tip of Boularderie Island (Prince colliery) between 1972-1975. Devco Railway built a spur to serve the adjacent Phalen and Lingan mines, extending the line to serve Nova Scotia Power Incorporated's Lingan Generating Station which opened November 1, 1979.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, the Devco Railway retired its diesels locomotives inherited from the Sydney and Louisburg Railway, which had purchased them second-hand during the early 1960s, and purchased a fleet of new diesel locomotives and coal hoppers, as well as building new locomotive shops at Victoria Junction, between Sydney and Glace Bay, and shut down the Glace Bay roundhouse and machine shops. It also built the tunnels and some surface support infrastructure for a new mine at Donkin in the early 1980s, however, this mine never went into production and the surface and sub-surface assets were mothballed.\n\nDEVCO also shut down a coal wash plant at Sydney Mines and built a large coal preparation/mixing and wash plant at Victoria Junction in its place. DEVCO continued to open the new mines at Phalen, Lingan and Prince while shutting older DOSCO-era mines in Glace Bay and New Waterford; particularly after a fatal explosion on February 24, 1979, at the antiquated No. 26 Colliery which killed 12 miners.\n\nFinally, DEVCO, built a new international shipping pier facility on Sydney Harbour near Whitney Pier, replacing the antiquated export piers inherited from DOSCO. With federal government financing, DEVCO was in expansion mode and with the high international prices for coal, sought to produce more Cape Breton coal for export than ever before.\n\nBy the late 1980s, production problems at DEVCO saw the last of the older mines inherited from DOSCO shut down, with production concentrated at Lingan, Phalen and Prince; the latter not receiving any rail service. The Point Aconi Generating Station was built by Nova Scotia Power Incorporated to receive coal from the Prince colliery directly by conveyor belt, however the Lingan and Phalen mines still hauled coal to the Victoria Junction preparation plant and then to the Lingan Generating Station.\n\nThe SYSCO steel mill stopped using DEVCO coal to produce coke as a fuel for its blast furnaces in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, SYSCO had modernized by changing to an electric-arc process, smelting recycled metal.\n\nProblems with flooding and roof-falls at the Lingan mine saw production cease in 1992, just months short of the colliery's 20-year design limit. The Phalen mine continued to be the only source of online traffic for the Devco Railway, however subsequent flooding and roof-falls at Phalen caused ever increasing production costs at a time of fiscal restraint by the federal government.\n\nIn mid-2008 DEVCO sponsored the new \"Industrial Research Chair in Mine Water Remediation & Management\" at Cape Breton University in order to assist in the mine closure and to research in new environmentally friendly after uses of the mining legacy.\n\nFaced with rising subsidies for DEVCO, the federal government announced it was getting out of the coal industry in January 1999 by mining out the rest of Phalen by the end of the year and attempting to sell the Prince colliery.\n\nIn September 1999, Phalen colliery closed for good, with 400 employees laid off and the only on-line traffic source for the Devco Railway severed. The Prince colliery continued with production, however coal was trucked from the mine to the Victoria Junction preparation plant, from which it was then taken by rail to the Lingan Generating Station. Devco Railway also began to be used for importing some coal from locations in the United States and South America, with the international shipping piers beginning to be used in the reverse of their intended design.\n\nOn November 23, 2001, Prince colliery closed for good, after the federal government failed to entice any private sector investors to purchase the mine. DEVCO was out of the coal mining business, however for a period of approximately 1 month, it was in the coal importation business. The federal government moved swiftly to sell off assets, transferring the mine properties and mineral rights back to the provincial Department of Natural Resources. DEVCO subsequently decommissioned the Victoria Junction coal wash plant and began to immediately prepare remediation of the mine sites.\n\nOn December 18, 2001 DEVCO sold all surface assets, including the international shipping piers, railway track, railway rights-of-way, locomotives and rolling stock, and a coal storage facility and locomotive shops at Victoria Junction to 510845 New Brunswick Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera Inc., the holding company which owns Nova Scotia Power Incorporated (Nova Scotia Power Corporation having been privatized in 1992).\n\nEmera subsequently contracted the operation of its newly acquired DEVCO surface assets to Logistec Corporation. Logistec sub-contracted operation of the railway to the Société des chemins de fer du Québec, a Quebec-based railway holding company and short-line operating company. The new railway was called Sydney Coal Railway, although ownership of the track and other assets remains with Emera's subsidiary, 510845 New Brunswick Inc. Logistec operates the international piers, which handles coal imports from the United States and South America, while Sydney Coal Railway hauls the coal to the storage facility at Victoria Junction before transporting it to NSP's Lingan Generating Station.\n\nOn December 31, 2009, DEVCO was amalgamated with Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation (ECBC).\n"}

Written by frontman Chris Cornell, \"Outshined\" was released in 1991 as the second single from the band's third studio album, \"Badmotorfinger\" (1991). It became the band's first single to reach the U.S. Mainstream Rock charts, where it peaked at number 45. The song was included on Soundgarden's 1997 greatest hits album, \"A-Sides\", the 2010 compilation album, \"Telephantasm\" and the live album \"Live on I-5\".\n\n\"Outshined\" was written by frontman Chris Cornell in the key of D major. It features an opening guitar riff and is performed in drop D tuning. The verses are in time, an unorthodox meter, common of some Soundgarden songs, such as \"Spoonman\", which has a riff in , and \"Black Hole Sun\", which has a riff in . Guitarist Kim Thayil has said that Soundgarden usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after the band had written it, and said that the use of odd meters was \"a total accident.\"\n\nIn an interview, Cornell said, \"I've never really been biographical in my lyrics, so when I wrote a line like 'I'm looking California and feeling Minnesota' from 'Outshined', it just felt refreshing.\" Cornell on the song:\nI don't know how everyone else feels ... but I definitely go through periods of extreme self-confidence, feeling like I can do anything. Perhaps a fan will sense that, like in a performance, and the hero image creeps out. But then someone will say something, however insignificant, or I'll get something in my head and, all of a sudden, I'm plummeting in the opposite direction, I'm a piece of shit, and I really can't do anything about it. That's where \"Outshined\" comes from, and why I'll never consider myself a hero.\n\nCornell explained the song's most famous lines: \"I'm looking California/And feeling Minnesota\", in an interview with \"Details\" magazine in 1996:\nOne of the first times I remember writing something personal was on tour. I was feeling really freaky and down, and I looked in the mirror and I was wearing a red T-shirt and some baggy tennis shorts. I remember thinking that as bummed as I felt, I looked like some beach kid. And then I came up with that line—’I’m looking California / And feeling Minnesota,’ from the song ‘Outshined’—and as soon as I wrote it down, I thought it was the dumbest thing. But after the record came out and we went on tour, everybody would be screaming along with that particular line when it came up in the song. That was a shock. How could anyone know that that was one of the most personally specific things I had ever written? It was just a tiny line. But somehow, maybe because it was personal, it just pushed that button.\n\n\"Outshined\" was released as a single in 1991 in various versions with the previously unreleased B-sides \"Cold Bitch\", \"I Can't Give You Anything\", \"Girl U Want\", \"Show Me\", \"I Don't Care About You\", \"Can You See Me\", and \"Homicidal Suicidal\". Outside the United States, the single was released commercially in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Outshined\" became an instant hit and a fan favorite, and gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations. \"Outshined\" features one of the most memorable Soundgarden lyrics, \"I'm looking California, and feeling Minnesota\". The lyric inspired the title for the 1996 film, \"Feeling Minnesota\", although Soundgarden is not featured on the soundtrack. The lyric \"feeling Minnesota\" has also been used by ESPN anchor Stuart Scott in reference to Kevin Garnett, who spent the first 11 years of his career as a player for the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nSteve Huey of AllMusic called the song a \"steadily creeping rocker with a main riff that strongly recalled the heavy murk of prime Black Sabbath\". He added, \"It's a powerful re-imagining of what the Sabbath sound can represent, and the song's encapsulation of early-'90s angst and directionlessness helps make it one of the definitive grunge anthems.\"\n\nThe song is featured on the soundtrack for the 1993 film, \"True Romance\". \"Outshined\" was part of the soundtrack of the 1994 bike racing game, \"Road Rash\", which received 3DO's 1994 \"Soundtrack of the Year\" award. It's also a playable song on the 2011 video game \"Rocksmith\".\n\nThere are two versions of the video, a U.S./international version and a Canadian version.\n\nThe music video for \"Outshined\" was produced by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and directed by Matt Mahurin, who would later direct the music video for \"The Day I Tried to Live\". The video features the band performing the song in a steel mill. The video was released in December 1991. It is a fan favorite and gained considerable airtime on MTV, yet the band members themselves disliked it. According to Cornell, Mahurin was too busy concentrating on Metallica's video for \"The Unforgiven\" while working on the video for \"Outshined\".\n\nCornell on the music video:\n[Matt Mahurin] does people on the street, social underbelly crap, but it's pretend underbelly. The clip was in the MTV Buzz-bin for a few weeks and then it fell off. About two months later he sent us the real cut, and it was fantastic, way better than the one that got on the air. It was frustrating. The unseen version was dangerous; the released version was a standard hard rock video. He kind of winged it, he was too busy with Metallica.\n\nThayil on the music video:\nAll I can remember is that they cut the guitar solo to make the video 'single-length'. I thought that was a stupid thing. Here we are, a guitar band, and the guitar solo—it may not be a great guitar solo—was edited out just for the video. That's ridiculous. It was a heavy song and our most popular video, even though it was a crap video. It never kicks in or explodes; there's no dynamics. The band never loosens up and explores the riff because the solo was taken out.\n\nIn another interview, Thayil said:\nIt was Buzz Bin at MTV and got played a lot. I think when it was in Buzz Bin, simultaneously Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and Pearl Jam's \"Alive\" were also in 'Buzz Bin' and they were also from Seattle, so maybe we were a little bit overshadowed—a little bit 'outshined' at that point! I didn't like our video either—it stunk! It was a last minute thing. I believe it was the couple who made that Smashing Pumpkins video where they were on the moon and stuff. Well, this was one of their early videos—and I hated it! That's what I remember most about that song—just how much I couldn't stand the video!\n\nAn alternate version of the music video for \"Outshined\" was shown on Canadian television.

Zenebework's full title was \"Her Imperial Highness, Princess Zenebework Haile Selassie\".\n\nOn 15 June 1932, Princess (\"Leult\") Zenebework was married to the hereditary prince of eastern Tigray Province, \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie Gugsa, a great-grandson of Emperor Yohannes IV. She was not yet 15 years old when they were married in Addis Ababa. Haile Selassie Gugsa was the son of \"Ras\" Gugsa Araya Selassie. He was thus the great-grandson of Emperor Yohannes IV of Ethiopia by his son \"Ras\" Araya Selassie. At the time, western Tigray was ruled by \"Ras\" Seyoum Mengesha, the son of \"Ras\" Mengesha Yohannes, another heir of Emperor Yohannes. The marriage between Princess Zenebework and \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie Gugsa was part of a dynastic alliance that also included the marriage of her brother, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen to Princess Wolete Israel Seyoum, the daughter of \"Ras\" Seyoum Mengesha.\n\nTies were thus strengthened between the reigning Shewa branch of the Imperial dynasty with both rival sides of the Tigrean branch of the dynasty. The marriage between Princess Zenebework and \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie however was evidently not a happy one, and the Princess is said to have complained of poor treatment. On his side, \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie resented that his cousin and rival Seyoum held the title of \"Ras\" while he was relegated to the lower rank of \"Dejazmach\". The two branches of Emperor Yohannes's family had long competed for seniority, and although the province of Tigray had been split between them, Haile Selassie Gugsa resented not having the title of \"Ras\". Princess Zenebework died suddenly in 1934, and upon hearing of her death, the distraught Emperor ordered that her body be flown immediately from Mekele and be brought to Addis Ababa for burial. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may have had something to do with the Princess having repeatedly complained of her treatment at the hands of her husband and his family. This added to the resentment felt by her husband towards the Emperor, and a chill developed between the Emperor and his son-in-law.\n\nUpon the Italian invasion in 1935, \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie Gugsa shocked the Imperial family and his country by being among the first to join the Italians. The Italians rewarded him with the title of \"Ras\", and recognized him as the senior prince of Tigray over \"Ras\" Seyoum who would later surrender to them and be placed under house arrest. Following the liberation of 1941, Haile Selassie Gugsa was labeled a traitor, and was placed under house arrest. His title of \"Ras\" that was bestowed by the Italians was not recognized by the Ethiopian government and he reverted to his old title of \"Dejazmach\". He was not freed from his house arrest until after the fall of the Ethiopian monarchy in 1974, and died shortly thereafter.\n\nPrincess Zenebework is buried in the Imperial family crypt under Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa. A hospital in the city was established in her memory.\n\n\n"}

The city is located in the central plains of Venezuela and was founded on February 25, 1785, by Father Mariano Martí. Along with Zaraza, Calabozo and San Juan de Los Morros (the state capital), Valle de la Pascua is one of the most important cities in the state of Guárico and the most important economically. The vicinity of the city was the scene of the Battle of Valle de la Pascua in February 1814.\n\nValle de la Pascua was founded in the 18th century as part of the colonization and expansion of the Spanish presence on to the \"Alto Llano de Caracas\", the name given to the central plains of the then Province of Venezuela, whose capital was Caracas.\n\nIn 1726, with the authorization of the government in Caracas, Capitán Francisco Carlos de Herrera, the regional administrator, granted the town of La Aguada de Valle de la Pascua together with the large cattle ranch called Santa Juana de la Cruz, to José Zamora. However the origins of Spanish settlement started with cattle ranches founded by Francisco Zamora Granados and his brother-in-law, Gabriel Sánchez Sajonero, who, the year previously, had arrived from Altagracia de Orituco and settled in the valley with their families, equipment and cattle.\n\nThe Law of Territorial Division of Gran Colombia, dated 25 June 1824, divided the Province of Caracas, of the Department of Venezuela, into twelve cantons (counties). Valle de la Pascua was placed in Chaguaramas canton. In 1848, by the presidential order of General José Tadeo Monagas, the Province of Caracas was redivided into four cantons and twenty-seven parishes. The parish of Valle de la Pascua was placed together with the canton capital of Chaguaramas, and the parishes of Chaguramal del Peral, Santa María de Ipire, Altamira, Altagracia de Iguana, Espino, Cabruta and Santa Rita de Manapire into Chaguaramas canton. In 1853 the canton of Chaguaramas was divided in two: Chaguaramas and Unare. Chaguaramas kept the town of Chaguaramas, Valle de la Pascua, Espino, Cabruta and Santa Rita de Manapire.\n\nIn the winter of 1939–1940 during their Candlemas Fiesta (Festival), Valle de la Pascua held a Candlemas Fair. That year they had over 15,000 visitors. The fairs provide both entertainment and the opportunity to show the products from the region.\n\nThis city is known for its agricultural and livestock and for being one of the most important industrial areas of the Venezuelan Llanos.\n\nIt has a population of approximately 182,000 inhabitants, which are devoted mostly to industrial activities and agricultural and professional.\n\nSites in the area include the Cathedral of Our Lady of Candlemas, the House of the Islanders, Ruben Zamora Church and Casa de la Cultura. It is a quite popular with tourists for tours of the countryside rangers, through companies that organize tours that lead to sites such as the artificial lake and the dam of Playa de Piedra.\n\nValle de la Pascua is among the cities of the State of Guarico with Calabozo and San Juan de Los Morros (state capital).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located next to the River Clyde between Hamilton and Motherwell. Strathclyde Park forms what used to be known as the \"Low parks\" of the now demolished Hamilton Palace and still includes buildings associated with the palace. When the loch was created in the early 1970s it involved the flooding of the old mining village of Bothwellhaugh. The park offers many amenities and attractions such as coarse angling, woodland walks, watersports, and a camping and caravanning site. One of Scotland's theme parks, M&D's, is located in the park. Until 1996, the music festival T in the Park was held here.\n\nThe west side of the park is bounded by the River Clyde, which was diverted when the loch was built in 1975. The original course can be seen between the east loch shore and the island. Across the Clyde is the M74 motorway, which creates a significant level of noise. The east side of the park is quieter, with woodland and paths leading up the slopes to Motherwell.\n\nThe remains of Bothwellhaugh Roman Fort and a Roman bathhouse can be seen in the park, where the South Calder Water flows into the loch. There is an arched Roman bridge across the South Calder nearby. The site of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge (1679) is to the north west of the park.\n\nAlthough the focus of the park is on recreation, a variety of habitats are present, including wetlands and native woodland.\n\nThe Greenlink Cycle Path start-off point is located in the park and travels to Motherwell Town Centre. Also, a section of the Clyde walkway, from Glasgow to New Lanark, runs through the park.\n\nMajor events held at the loch include the rowing events for the 1986 Commonwealth Games, the 1996 World Rowing Junior Championships (and the World Rowing Championships for non-Olympic events), the 2005 World Rowing Masters Regatta, the 2007 World Rowing U23 Championships the 2006 and 2014 Commonwealth Rowing Championships. and the 2018 European Rowing Championships.\n\nThe loch also hosts the British Rowing Championships once every four years, which are normally held in Holme Pierrepont, Nottingham, and also every four years hosts the Home International Regatta.\n\nThe park is home to Strathclyde Park Rowing Club, Edinburgh University Boat Club, Heriot-Watt University Boat Club and to the Scottish Rowing Centre.\n\nThe watersports events of the 2005 Glasgow Special Olympics and the 2006 Scottish Triathlon Championships were staged at the park.\n\nSince 2005, the park has been the venue for the annual \"Stereofunk\" music festival. The park was also the venue for the T in the Park festival between 1994 and 1996.\n\nIn 2009 the park was used to host the first ever Great Scottish Swim, a mass participation open water swim event. The event was due to be held there again in 2010 but was cancelled due to poisonous blue-green algae in the loch.\n\nThe park was an official venue for the 2011 International Children's Games.\n\nIn 2014, Strathclyde Park hosted the triathlon event of the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\nThe 2018 European Triathlon Championships were held at the Strathclyde Park as part of the multi-sport 2018 European Championships.\n\nThe park hosts a Parkrun event at 09:30 every Saturday morning. It has also hosted an 'Inflatable 5k' event, popular with families and participants collecting charity donations.\n\nOn the June 2012 Strathclyde Country Park was host to the Western District Open Water Swimming Championship that attracted up to 70 competitors.\n\nFollowing the race 57 people were discovered to be suffering from stomach cramps, sickness and diarrhoea 5 of the 57 tested positive for norovirus. All water based activities were subsequently temporarily suspended.\n\nExperts attributed the incident to heavy rainfall prior to the event, with council officials confirming that tests of the water quality in the days before the event within the accepted open water guidelines.\n\nThe loch previously had issues with open water events affected by blue and green algae growth, resulting in the cancellation of the Great Scottish Swim in August 2010. In summer 2011 algae growth also put a stop to water sports just two months before the start of the International Children's Games. The Great Scottish Swim would again be cancelled in 2012.\n\n\n"}

He taught at the Liceo Musicale \"G. B. Viotti\" in Vercelli from 1965 to 1981, and held a professorship at the Antonio Vivaldi Conservatory in Alessandria from 1981 to 2004. The Conservatory awarded him the Marengo Music Prize in 1998.\n\nGilardino has composed much music for solo guitar, as well as chamber music and concertos. His solo works include five volumes of \"Studi di virtuosità e di trascendenza\" (1981-1988), two numbered sonatas (1985, 1986) as well as several titled sonatas and sonatinas, two sets of variations (1989, 1991), and \"Ikonostas\" for a guitar tuned in G (2004).\n\nThe \"Studi di virtuosità e di trascendenza\" represent one of the most significant contributions to the guitar repertoire in the 20th century. The title places the collection in the tradition of the \"Transcendental Etudes\" by Franz Liszt. Numbers 1 through 48 have dedications that play an important role in identifying influences and traditions that are important to the composer, and help provide a context in which to interpret the individual etudes. These have been recorded by the guitarist Cristiano Porqueddu for Brilliant Classics.\n\nHe has also written four works for guitar with guitar orchestra, seven concertos for guitar, some in combination with other instruments (including mandolin and accordion), and several duets (for guitar with bassoon, cello, violin and vibraphone).\n\nFrom 1967 to 2006, Gilardino supervised the publication of hundreds of new guitar works by Edizioni Musicali Bèrben. He has also discovered the \"Variazioni\" by Ottorino Respighi and several works written for the guitarist Andrés Segovia by Cyril Scott, Pierre de Bréville, Lennox Berkeley and many others. He was artistic director of the Andrés Segovia Foundation of Linares from 1997 to 2005.\n\nIn 2009 the Guitar Foundation of America conferred upon him the prestigious Artistic Achievement Award which is reserved for performers, composers, pedagogues, and scholars who have made monumental contributions to the development of the art and life of the classical guitar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLP:\n\nLUIGI ATTADEMO - plays \"Variazioni sulla Follìa\"\nCD \"Folías\"\nGuitart Collection Guit 2026\nwww.luigiattademo.it\n\nGIANLUCA BARBERO plays\n\"Studio n. 6 – Soledad - Omaggio a Francisco Goya\"\n\"Studio n. 47 – Le rose sulla neve – In memoriam Eso Peluzzi\"\nMap – Lr Cd 116\n\nLUIGI BISCALDI and QUARTETTO DI ASTI\nplays\n\"Concerto d'estate\" per chitarra sola e quartetto di chitarre\n\"Concierto de Córdoba\" para guitarra solista y cuarteto de guitarras\nBERCD 833-2 Bèrben\n\nPIERO BONAGURI\nesegue \"Colloquio con Andrés Segovia\"\n\"Pocci 2004\" Guitar Reference\nVP Music Media\n\nChitarrista MICHAEL BRACKEN\nplays \"Sonata n. 2 – Hivern Florit\"\n\"Good News\"\nAtma Disques\n\nTRIO CITHAROEDIA\nplays\n\"Poema d'inverno\" per tre chitarre\n\"Ferenc Farkas, Angelo Gilardino\nComplete works for Guitar Trio\"\nNIC 1051 - Guitart Collection\n\nANGELO COLONE\nplays\n\"Studio n. 18 – Omaggio a de Falla\"\n\"Sintesi\"\nMap – Lr Cd 087\n\nANGELO COLONE\nesegue\nplays\n\"Tema con variazioni (Omaggio a Fernando Sor)\"\n\"Già la pioggia è con noi (Omaggio a Salvatore Quasimodo)\"\n\"Sacrificio\" (Omaggio ad Agustin Barrios Mangoré)\n\"Concerto per chitarra e orchestra da camera – Leçons de Ténèbres\"\n\"Jondo (Omaggio a Joaquin Turina)\n\"Soledad (Omaggio a Francisco Goya)\n\"Paesaggio lucano (Omaggio al pittore Mauro Masi)\"\nCD \"Angelo Angelo\"\nwww.angelocolone.it\n\nMARCO DE SANTI\nplays\n\"Quattro Studi di virtuosità e di trascendenza\"\n\"Ocram\"\nEMI I.071\n\nWILLIAM FEASLEY\nplays\n\"Soledad (Omaggio a Francisco Goya)\"\n\"Echoes of Goya\"\nSONORA SO22587CD\n\nFABIO FEDERICO\nplays\n\"Elegia di marzo\"\n\"Mediterranea\"\n\"Alleluia\"\n\"El rosario\"\n\"Jondo\"\nCD \"Estudios\"\nEtnoworld Classical\nwww.fabiofederico.com\n\nREZA GANJAVI\nplays \"Canzoni Dimenticate\"\nper varie formazioni a duo con chitarra\nCD \"In Friendship\"\n\nTILMAN HOPPSTOCK\nplays\n\"Etude n. 3\"\nCD \"The 20th Century Guitar\"\nSignum SigX90-00\n\nLUIGI GIFFI\nplays\n\"Elegia di marzo\"\n\"Sacrificio\"\n\"Quattuor in Musica\"\n\nMARTHA MASTERS\nplays\n\"Colloquio con Andrés Segovia\"\nCD \"Viaggio in Italia\"\nGSP1031CD\n\nLUCIO MATARAZZO\nplays \"Quattro Studi di virtuosità e di trascendenza\"\nCD \"LM & friends\"\nCD GUITART COLLECTION\n\nALBERTO MESIRCA\nplays\n\"Annunciazione – Omaggio al Beato Angelico\"\n\"Ikonostas – Omaggio a Pavel Florenskij\n\"Ikonostas\"\nMap – Lr Cd 112\n\nMICHAEL PARTINGTON\nplays\n\"Studio n. 12 (Omaggio a Prokofiev)\"\n\"20th Century Guitar\"\nRoserecord Rose 1004CD\n\nCRISTIANO PORQUEDDU\nplays\n\"Sonata n. 2 - Hivern Florit\"\n\"Embarquement pour Cithère\"\n\"Omaggio a Sergej Prokof'ev\"\n\"Les arbres rouges\"\nSeicorde 188IT\nwww.cristianoporqueddu.com\n\nCRISTIANO PORQUEDDU\nplays\n\"Studies 1-12\"\nCD Trascendentia Vol.I\nSeicorde 188IT\nwww.trascendentia.com\n\nCRISTIANO PORQUEDDU\nplays\n\"Studies 13-24\"\nTrascendentia Vol.II\nSeicorde 188IT\nwww.trascendentia.com\n\nCRISTIANO PORQUEDDU\nplays\n\"Studies 25-36\"\nTrascendentia Vol.III\nSeicorde 188IT\nwww.trascendentia.com\n\nCRISTIANO PORQUEDDU\nplays\n\"Studies 37-48\"\nTrascendentia Vol IV\nSeicorde SNR019\nwww.trascendentia.com\n\nCRISTIANO PORQUEDDU\nplays\n\"Studies 49-60\"\nTrascendentia Vol V\nwww.trascendentia.com\n\nMARCELLO RIVELLI\nplays\n\"Sonata n. 2 - Hivern Florit\"\nGuitart Collection Guit 2030\n\nGIANLUCA SABBADIN\nplays\n\"Studio n. 47 – Le rose sulla neve\"\n\"Studio n, 18 – El rosario\"\n\"Studio n. 4 – Elegia di marzo\"\nCD \"Recital per chitarra sola\"\n\nGIULIO TAMPALINI\nplays\n\"Works for Guitar 2002-2004\"\nwww.giuliotampalini.it\n\nCORDAMINAZIONI (MARCELLO DE CAROLIS - LUCA FABRIZIO)\nplays\n\"Albero solitario - ricordo della grande pittrice lucana Maria Padula\"\nwww.cordaminazioni.com\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2146329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146329", "title": "Steve McCurry", "text": "Steve McCurry\n\nSteve McCurry (born April 23, 1950 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American photographer, freelancer and photojournalist. His photo \"Afghan Girl\", of a girl with piercing green eyes, has appeared on the cover of \"National Geographic\" several times. McCurry has photographed many assignments for \"National Geographic\" and has been a member of Magnum Photos since 1986.\n\nMcCurry is the recipient of numerous awards, including Magazine Photographer of the Year, awarded by the National Press Photographers Association; the Royal Photographic Society's Centenary Medal; and two first-place prizes in the World Press Photo contest (1985 and 1992).\n\nMcCurry attended Penn State University. He originally planned to study cinematography and filmmaking, but instead gained a degree in theater arts and graduated in 1974. He became interested in photography when he started taking pictures for the Penn State newspaper \"The Daily Collegian\".\n\nAfter a year working in India, McCurry traveled to northern Pakistan where he met two Afghans who told him about the war across the border in Afghanistan.\n\nMcCurry's career was launched when, disguised in Afghani garb, he crossed the Pakistan border into rebel-controlled areas of Afghanistan just before the Soviet invasion. \"As soon as I crossed the border, I came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out,\" he says. He left with rolls of film sewn into his turban and stuffed in his socks and underwear. These images were subsequently published by \"The New York Times\", \"Time\" and \"Paris Match\" and won him the Robert Capa Gold Medal for Best Photographic Reporting from Abroad.\n\nMcCurry covered more armed conflicts like the Iran–Iraq War, Lebanon Civil War, the Cambodian Civil War, the Islamic insurgency in the Philippines, the Gulf War and the Afghan Civil War. There have been a couple of dangerous moments where McCurry came close to losing his life. He was almost drowned in India and he survived an airplane crash in Yugoslavia. McCurry has had his work featured in magazines worldwide and he is a frequent contributor to National Geographic.\n\nMcCurry concentrates on the toll war takes on humans. He intends to show what war does to not only the landscape, but to the people who inhabit that land. \"Most of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person’s face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape, that you could call the human condition.\" What McCurry wants his viewers to take away from his photographs is the \"human connection between all of us.\" He believes there is always some common thing between all humans despite the differences in religion, language, ethnicity, etc. McCurry also states, \"I have found that I get completely consumed by the importance of the story I am telling, the feeling that the world has got to know. It's never about the adrenaline. It's about the story.\" However, sometimes McCurry has witnessed some \"horrific\" and \"distressing\" sights. In times like these, he uses his camera as a \"shield\" because it's easier to witness these events through a viewfinder.\n\nOn September 10, 2001, McCurry had just gotten back from Tibet. The morning of September 11, McCurry received a call saying the World Trade Center was on fire. He went up to the roof of his building and started taking photographs, he didn't know it was a plane that hit the towers. McCurry was on the roof when both of the towers fell, \"they were just gone. It didn’t seem possible. Like you’re seeing something but you don’t really believe what you’re seeing.\" After the fall of the towers, McCurry ran to Ground Zero with his assistant. He describes the scene, \"there was this very fine white powder everywhere and all this office paper, but there was no recognizable office equipment—no filing cabinets, telephones, computers. It seemed like the whole thing had been pulverized.\" McCurry left later that night and went back early on September 12, he didn't have any press credentials and had to sneak past security. He was eventually caught and escorted off Ground Zero, he wouldn't go back again.\n\nMcCurry is portrayed in a TV documentary \"The Face of the Human Condition\" (2003) by Denis Delestrac.\n\nMcCurry switched from shooting color slide film to digital capture in 2005 for the convenience of editing in the field and transmitting images to photo editors. He said that he had no nostalgia about working in film in an interview with \"The Guardian.\" \"Perhaps old habits are hard to break, but my experience is that the majority of my colleagues, regardless of age, have switched over... The quality has never been better. You can work in extremely low light situations, for example.\"\n\nMcCurry shoots in both film and digital, but says he prefers shooting with transparency film. Eastman Kodak gifted him the last roll of Kodachrome film to ever be produced by Kodak. McCurry shot the roll, which was processed in July 2010 by Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, Kansas. Most of these photos were published on the Internet by Vanity Fair. McCurry states, \"I shot it for 30 years and I have several hundred thousand pictures on Kodachrome in my archive. I'm trying to shoot 36 pictures that act as some kind of wrap up – to mark the passing of Kodachrome. It was a wonderful film.\"\n\nIn 2015, he was hired by Microsoft to take photographs in areas of New Zealand, which were used as wallpapers in Windows 10.\n\nIn 2019, his book \"Steve McCurry. Animals\" was published by Taschen and is a compilation of his favorite photographs of animals.\n\nMcCurry took \"Afghan Girl\" in December 1984. It portrays an approximately 12-year-old Pashtun orphan in the Nasir Bagh refugee camp near Peshawar, Pakistan. McCurry found the girl when he heard \"unexpected laughter\" coming from children inside a one-room school tent for girls. \"I noticed this one little girl with these incredible eyes, and I instantly knew that this was really the only picture I wanted to take,\" he says. This was the first time the girl had ever been photographed. The image was named as \"the most recognized photograph\" in the history of the \"National Geographic\" magazine, and was used as the cover photograph on the June 1985 issue. The photo has also been widely used on Amnesty International brochures, posters, and calendars. The identity of the \"Afghan Girl\" remained unknown for over 17 years until McCurry and a \"National Geographic\" team located the woman, Sharbat Gula, in 2002. McCurry said, \"Her skin is weathered; there are wrinkles now, but she is as striking as she was all those years ago.\"\n\nIn 2019, a small but growing vlogger and professional photographer by the name of Tony Northrup released a research documentary accusing McCurry of obtaining the photograph under false pretenses, and endangering Gula's wellbeing in doing so. McCurry's publicity team responded by accusing Northrup of slander, and the clip was removed. Shortly thereafter, however, it was re-uploaded with a number of corrections, with an accompanying document that detailed a number of sources Northrup had obtained. Sharbat Gula herself had also previously provided some commentary on the photograph, published by BBC News in 2017.\n\nIn 2016 McCurry was accused of extensively manipulating his images with Photoshop and by other means, removing individuals and other elements.\nIn a May 2016 interview with PetaPixel, McCurry did not specifically deny making major changes, indicating that he now defines his work as \"visual storytelling\" and as \"art\". However, he subsequently added that others print and ship his images while he is travelling, implying that they were responsible for the significant manipulation. \"That is what happened in this case. It goes without saying that what happened with this image was a mistake for which I have to take responsibility,\" he concluded.\n\nWhen discussing the issue with a writer for \"Time\"s Lightbox website, McCurry provided similar comments about being a \"visual storyteller\", though without suggesting that the manipulation was done by others without his knowledge. In fact, the \"Time\" writer made the following statement, \"Faced with mounting evidence of his own manipulations, McCurry has been forced to address his position in photography.\" In neither interview did he discuss when the heavy photo manipulation began, or which images have been manipulated. However, considering the controversy it has created, he said that \"going forward, I am committed to only using the program in a minimal way, even for my own work taken on personal trips.\" McCurry also offered the following conclusion to \"Time\" Lightbox, \"Reflecting on the situation … even though I felt that I could do what I wanted to my own pictures in an aesthetic and compositional sense, I now understand how confusing it must be for people who think I'm still a photojournalist.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1876 by the Benedictine monks of Belmont Abbey. The school is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church and the Order of Saint Benedict. It is endorsed by The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College. Belmont Abbey is the only college in North Carolina affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nOffering an undergraduate education, the college enrolls students from diverse ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds.\n\nBelmont Abbey College was founded in 1876 as St. Mary's College by Benedictine monks from Saint Vincent Archabbey in Pennsylvania. Father Jeremiah O'Connell purchased Caldwell farm and donated the land to the Benedictines, hoping the community would found a Catholic educational institution in the Carolinas. On April 21, 1876, Father Herman Wolfe, from St. Vincent's, arrived with two students to take possession of the property and begin classes. In 1878, the college held its first commencement exercises. Katharine Drexel, a benefactor of the monastery and college, visited Belmont Abbey in 1904. The present name of the college was adopted in 1913. \nIn 1967 John Oetgen, college president and Benedictine priest, conferred an honorary degree on the Protestant evangelist Billy Graham, marking what was at the time seen as a bold ecumenical gesture. Originally a college for young men, Belmont Abbey became a coeducational institution in 1972. In 1987, Sacred Heart College for women merged with the Abbey, and its campus began to host a variety of Abbey classes and programs.\n\nThe Belmont Abbey Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. It encompasses 14 contributing buildings, 3 contributing sites, 1 contributing structure, and 1 contributing object (a statue of Saint Benedict (1924)). It includes at its heart the separately listed Belmont Abbey Cathedral. Other contributing buildings include the Brothers' Building (1893, 1897, 1904), Old Science (1893), Jubilee Hall (1897), The Monastery (1880, 1891, and 1894), the College Building (or Stowe Hall, 1886, 1888, 1898), Saint Leo Hall (1907), and The Haid (1929).\n\nMaurus Hall is centrally located on campus and houses a student lounge, grill, and the Holy Grounds coffee shop. Across from Maurus Hall is the Haid, which serves as a student and community theater. The Haid was originally built as a gymnasium. The Abbey Players now perform there. Along Abbey Lane, towards the far end of the campus, are the Vincent Abbot Taylor Library and the William Gaston Science Hall. Administrative offices are located in Robert Stowe Hall, with classrooms on the second and third floors. St. Leo's Hall, built in the American Benedictine style, houses the Campus Book Store and Catholic Shop on the first floor. Professorial offices are located in St. Leo's Hall, and Grace Auditorium is located on the third floor.\n\nThe quad is located between the Poellath and O'Connell residence halls, both constructed in the early 1960s. Raphael Arthur Hall, constructed in 1967, offers students individual rooms and sits on the hill above Poellath, near Campus Police. The St. Joseph's Eucharistic Adoration Chapel, dedicated in 2008, is across from Campus Police. Wheeler Athletic Center, completed in 1970, is located behind Poellath Hall. At the back of the campus are the four Cuthbert Allen Apartment buildings, built in 1989. The newly renovated Student Commons, located next to the new cafeteria, houses the campus mailroom, snack machines, a lounge area, and Student Life offices. Behind the Student Commons are the St. Scholastica and St. Benedict residence halls. The Lourdes Grotto, an official pilgrimage shrine, is situated behind O'Connell Hall.\n\nThe Abbey Church, the most prominent building on the college's campus, was completed in 1894 under the supervision of Abbot Leo Haid. Drexel made significant donations to the completion of the structure, which served as North Carolina's first and only cathedral prior to the erection of the Diocese of Raleigh in 1924. The church is constructed in the gothic-revival style out of brick and granite, built in the shape of a Latin cross. The towers of the church, named Ora (the taller) and Labora (the smaller), can be seen from most of the college campus. The taller of the two towers holds bells which ring to signal the celebration of the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours. The monastic community continues to hold daily services which are open to the student body and the public. Following the Second Vatican Council, the interior of the Abbey Church was renovated in a modernist style in order to facilitate the liturgical reforms of the era. In 1975, Belmont Abbey lost its territorial status and cathedral rank to the newly created Diocese of Charlotte. In 1998 Pope John Paul II named the Abbey Church a minor basilica in recognition of the historic and aesthetic significance of the structure.\n\nThe Sisters of Mercy of Belmont reside at Sacred Heart Convent, in downtown Belmont. The convent is located on a campus made up of various organizations including Catherine's House, Holy Angels, and Mercy Heritage Center, archives for the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas. In 1892 the sisters began a finishing school for girls that eventually became a four-year degree institution, Sacred Heart College. Sacred Heart College closed in 1987, and a section of the Sacred Heart College is now rented by Belmont Abbey and called Sacred Heart Campus; classes are offered at Sacred Heart for both traditional and adult degree students. Belmont Abbey continues to offer alumnae services to graduates from Sacred Heart College.\n\nThe Saint Joseph Adoration Chapel was dedicated on November 7, 2008. It marked the first building project under President Bill Thierfelder. Dr. Thierfelder wanted all that came to the Belmont Abbey College campus, that the college finds its center in Jesus Christ. During the Fall and Spring semesters, the chapel is open 24 hours a day for prayers and the Blessed Sacrament is exposed from 6:00am to 9:00pm.\n\nPlans were proposed by the President of the college in 2008 to construct a new residence hall on campus in order to facilitate increased enrollment.\nIn the Fall of 2012, construction began on two new residence halls to open in the Fall of 2013.\n\nIn the Summer of 2011, construction began on a state-of-the-art integrated cafeteria. The construction was complete in time for the new cafeteria to open to the student body beginning in the Fall of 2012.\n\nThe Abbey is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and approved by the American Medical Association. More than 80 percent of the faculty at Belmont Abbey hold doctoral degrees in their subjects. After completing a core curriculum, students declare a major and concentrate within their chosen areas of study.\n\nThe college's First Year Symposium, required for incoming freshmen, seeks to acclimate new students to college life. Taught by professors from various fields, this course explains the theories of a liberal education and introduces students to the Rule of St. Benedict and the Catholic intellectual tradition.\nIn 2006 the Abbey was ranked as one of the best colleges in the Southeast by \"U.S. News & World Report\" and \"The Princeton Review\". The Abbey was likewise ranked first in North Carolina – and second in the Southeast – for class size by the \"U.S. News & World Report\".\n\nThe Belmont Abbey Crusaders participate in the NCAA's Division II program. The Crusaders are members of Conference Carolinas. Men's and women's lacrosse, women's golf. Men's and women's tennis and men's and women's track and field have been added for the 2009 season. Al McGuire coached Basketball for the Crusaders from 1957 to 1964. During his tenure the team had 5 post-season tournament appearances.\nIn 2009, the Crusaders Baseball team reached the NCAA Division II World Series, at the USA Baseball Training Complex located in Cary, North Carolina. The Crusaders were ranked 6th in their respective regional tournament and went on to win four straight against nationally ranked teams to capture their first regional championship. The Crusaders fell to eventual National Champions Lynn University after winning two in a row. The Crusaders finished the season ranked 3rd in the Nation.\n\nIn 2012, the women's volleyball, women's soccer, and men's basketball teams all won the NCAA Division II Conference Carolinas title. In 2018, the men's lacrosse team won the NCAA Division II Conference Carolinas title.\n\nAs a member of Conference Carolinas, Belmont Abbey College competes annually for the league's Messick Award, which is presented for demonstrating the best overall sportsmanship over the entire conference schedule. As of 2019, Belmont Abbey Athletics has won the overall Messick Award four times: 2011-12, 2012–13, 2013-14 (tie) and 2016-17.\n\nThe Abbey has over 40 student organizations, an active Student Government Association, and many Greek organizations belonging to the college's Greek Council. Kappa Sigma is the only active fraternity on campus, while active sororities are: Tau Kappa Delta, Epsilon Sigma Alpha, Alpha Sigma Pi.\n\nBelmont Abbey has a theatre department. The Abbey Players of Belmont Abbey College were founded in 1883, and have been a part of campus life for over a century. At present, the theatre produces six shows a year, representing a wide repertoire of drama, comedy and musicals. Participation in the Abbey Players is open to any interested member of the Belmont Abbey College community, and students, faculty, staff and monks regularly appear together. In addition, it functions as the Belmont Community Theatre, which brings in theatre artists from the surrounding Metrolina area.\n\nThe new campus cafeteria (Built in the summer of 2012) is located on the residential side of campus, next to the Walter Coggins Student Commons. Robert Lee Stowe Hall contains a grill and Holy Grounds coffee shop.\n\nIncoming freshmen are required to live in either Poellath or O'Connell; two-story single-sex residence halls. Beginning in the Fall of 2013, upperclassmen were given the option to live in the newly built Saint Benedict Hall and Saint Scholastica Hall, single-sex resident halls for males and females respectively. Raphael Arthur Hall provides residents the choice to live in individual rooms. In addition to the five residence halls on campus, upperclassmen are eligible to live in either one of the four on campus Cuthbert Allen apartment buildings or the Cloisters, off-campus apartments in nearby Mount Holly, North Carolina.\n\n\nIn 2007 the college's administration removed healthcare coverage for \"abortion, contraception, and voluntary sterilization\" after discovering that these were covered by the college's healthcare policy. Eight faculty members responded by filing complaints to the North Carolina Department of Insurance, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Women's Law Center. The latter threatened a lawsuit on behalf of the eight faculty members, several of whom were allegedly lifelong Catholics.\n\nAfter the student newspaper, \"The Crusader\", published an article in May 2008 pointing out that the Abbey profits from the sale of contraceptives at two convenience stores that lease land from the Abbey, the Abbot responded by stating that: \"\"[They] are preponderantly good operations, i.e. 99 percent or more of their business is not problematic, and the employment generation and economic stimulation they provide for the community of Belmont are worth tolerating a small amount of evil. The Abbey is not willing to lease to them because they sell contraceptives, but despite it.\"\n\nAccording to a November 11, 2011 online news story by Patricia L. Guilfoyle of Catholic News Service, \"Belmont Abbey College is suing the federal government over a new regulation that requires employer health insurance plans to provide free coverage of contraceptives and sterilization, even if it may be contrary to their religious beliefs.\"\n\nAccording to a June 20, 2013 online news story by the Associated Press, Belmont Abbey College objected to the rezoning of a nearby 6 acre piece of land that would have been used for a no-kill shelter.\n\nIn 2016, the college, along with other religious colleges and universities throughout the United States came under increasing criticism from LGBT advocates for refusing to implement anti-discrimination policies on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students. Belmont Abbey College argued that its status as a primarily Catholic institution was in conflict with these anti-discrimination protections. In a statement, the college claimed that such recognition and protection of LGBT individuals would \"abdicate the responsibility of the college community as a whole to act in accord with its fundamental identity as a community which publicly identifies itself as in communion with the Catholic Church.\"\n\n"}

Maintained by a voluntary team of contributors, the site is dedicated to providing news and information about \"Half-Life\" and \"Half-Life 2\", related modifications and other Valve titles. It was founded by Kevin \"Fragmaster\" Bowen and was at one point the largest of an array of GameSpy-run gaming websites known as the Planet Network. Following GameSpy's closure, Planet Half-Life seems to have ceased updating.\n\nPlanet Half-Life's content consisted mainly of a news wire on its front page. Stories on updates, patches, press releases and events related to \"Half-Life\" and just about anything else concerning Valve are posted on an almost daily basis. These stories are also mirrored in the site's forum for reader comments.\n\nIn addition to the news, Planet Half-Life hosts extensive, in-depth collections of information regarding \"Half-Life\", \"Half-Life 2\" (along with \"Portal\"), \"Counter-Strike\", \"Team Fortress\" and \"Day of Defeat\". These sections cover overviews of each game as well as any official expansion packs related to them, as well as going over their storylines, important characters, enemies, weapons, cheats, walkthroughs, and, in the case of the multiplayer games, map overviews and strategies. The information found on these pages is original work drafted by the staff writers and senior editors collectively (although without any individual credits given, unlike other articles found on the site).\n\nA major feature of Planet Half-Life, and all other planet sites, is its public forum. These forums include boards ranging from general discussion to technical help.\n\nIn August 2007, the forums changed format to comply with GameSpy's ForumPlanet standard (the \"IGN SnowBoards\" system), removing some outdated features and adding many new ones, such as a dynamic news box that streams in late-breaking news from not only PHL, but all other planet sites as well. This also changed the registration process for the forum, from a per-planet account basis to a network-wide, global account basis. At this time Planet Half-Life's sister sites Planet Fortress and CS.net were officially unsupported and their forums were to be merged into PHL's, although this process lasted over a year before it was complete.\n\nPlanet Half-Life has been running public game servers since 2006, hosting 24/7 map rotations for \"Counter-Strike 1.6\", \"\", \"\", \"Half-Life: Deathmatch\", \"\" and \"Team Fortress 2\". However, currently only the \"Half-life 2: Deathmatch\" and \"Day of Defeat: Source\" servers are consistently online and even they rarely see much use. The PHL servers are maintained by WOLFServers.com.\n\nIn addition to public servers, Planet Half-Life also has a Steam Community group. Steam Communities are in early stages of development. The PHL Community can only host a chat room and specialized news updates for now, but more features will be added in the future based on suggestions from readers.\n\nIn June 2006, Planet Half-Life began its own wiki project. To date, the PHLWiki contains over a hundred articles dealing with fictional \"Half-Life\" characters, creatures and locations in an in-universe, encyclopedic form as well as real life articles on mods, player terminology and strategy guides. The in-universe and real life articles are kept separately, although they can be linked to each other. Before being announced publicly, most of the existing pages, particularly articles making up the fictional encyclopedia, were written by PHL staff writers. The PHLWiki is open to public viewing and editing.\n\nPlanet Half-Life also offers free web hosting for \"Half-Life\" themed websites. The web hosting is regulated through GameSpy, though the address of hosted sites is a subset of the Planet Half-Life domain. This was a major attraction of the site in its early days and many original \"Half-Life\" mod teams took advantage of the offer. However this feature has not been utilized nearly as much since the release of \"Half-Life 2\". A directory of the old sites still exists, although most have been abandoned by their creators.\n\nPlanet Half-Life has been running since April 27, 1999. Since then, it has undergone numerous format changes, both in content and aesthetic. The following is a timeline of major changes and other events.\n\n"}

All delegates at the time of the pageant are between the ages at least of 17 and 25, with the upper age limit expanded to 27 in 2012. The delegates must be of at least partial Chinese descent.\n\nStarting in 2007, the pageant allowed mainland Chinese participants, and the Chinese name of the pageant changed from Gwokjai Wàhyeuih Síujé gihngsyún (Mandarin: \"Guójì huáyì xiǎojiě jìngxuǎn\"), which literally translated to \"Miss International of Chinese Descent Pageant\" to Gwokjai Jūngwàh Síujé Gihngsyún (Mandarin: \"Guójì zhōnghuá xiǎojiě jìngxuǎn\") to reflect the change, matching the English pageant title of \"Miss Chinese International Pageant\". In 2009, a record number of 11 delegates came from Mainland China, more than one-third of the total contestant count. The number of China delegates has since decreased, with the 2013 pageant having only one Mainland Chinese delegate, representing Foshan.\n\n\nNorth America\n\nSouth America\n\n\n\n\nThe first two pageants (1988 & 1989) were held in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. However, in 1990, TVB decided to shift the pageant date to the beginning of the year to coincide with Lunar New Year. But since Miss Chinese International Pageant 1989 was not held until mid-December, the 3rd Miss Chinese International Pageant came early 1991 with no pageant being held in 1990. Since then, the pageant was held late January or early February of every year.\n\nIn 2010, the pageant reverted to being held in November, delaying the 22nd Miss Chinese International Pageant by almost 10 months. Therefore, Christine Kuo, Miss Chinese International 2009 is the longest serving titleholder, having served 658 days from January 17, 2009 to November 5, 2010. The delay of the pageant meant that several regional titleholders from 2009 were not able to enter Miss Chinese International Pageant 2010 as they have already crowned their successors by November 2010, including Miss Hong Kong 2009 Sandy Lau. Miss Hong Kong Pageant 2010 was held in August and Lau's successor, Toby Chan, represented Hong Kong in Miss Chinese International 2010 instead.\n\nOne year later, TVB announced that the 23rd Miss Chinese International Pageant would be delayed until January 15, 2012, meaning that there would be no pageant held in 2011. This is the first time since 1990 a pageant would not be held during a calendar year. As with the year before, several regional titleholders from 2010 would not be able to enter Miss Chinese International Pageant 2012 as they have already crowned their successors by the end of 2011. However, the organizers allowed 2010 regional titleholders from Auckland, Kuala Lumpur, Melbourne, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver to compete with their 2011 counterparts in Miss Chinese International 2012, marking a first in the pageant's history where two representatives of the same region compete together.\n\nThe 31st Miss Chinese International Pageant was originally scheduled to take place on February 15, 2020 in Hong Kong. However, on January 28, 2020, organizer TVB announced that due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, for the safety of the delegates, crew, and audience, the pageant would be postponed to a later date to be announced.\n\nDelegates representing Canadian cities have won 11 of the 27 iterations of the competition; with Vancouver winning seven titles (2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2016), Toronto three times (1992, 1997 and 2009) and Montreal once (1993).\n\nDelegates from pageant organizer Hong Kong have won thrice, but have recorded the most top three finishes with 18.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his role as Marshall Eriksen in the CBS sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\", as well as for his work with producer Judd Apatow on the television series \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"Undeclared\", and for the critically and commercially successful comedies he has starred in, written, and produced.\n\nSegel has starred in several films, including \"Knocked Up\" (2007), \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" (2008), \"I Love You, Man\" (2009), \"Despicable Me\" (2010), \"Bad Teacher\" (2011), \"Jeff, Who Lives at Home\" (2011), \"The Muppets\" (2011), \"The Five-Year Engagement\" (2012), \"This Is 40\" (2012), \"Sex Tape\" (2014) and \"The Discovery\" (2017). His performance as the late author David Foster Wallace in the 2015 film \"The End of the Tour\" was met with critical acclaim, earning him a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead. In 2012, Segel was named the Hasty Pudding Man of the Year.\n\nSegel was born January 18, 1980, in Los Angeles, to Jillian (née Jordan; born 1952) and Alvin Segel, a lawyer. He grew up in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. He has an older brother, Adam, and a younger sister, Alison.\n\nSegel's father is Jewish, whereas his mother is of English, Scottish, Irish, and French ancestry. He has stated that he was raised Jewish, as well as \"a little bit of everything\". Segel went to Hebrew school and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony, and also attended St. Matthew's Parish School, a private Episcopal school.\n\nFollowing elementary school and middle school, Segel completed his high school studies at Harvard-Westlake School, where his frame helped him as an active member of the 1996 and 1997 CIF state champion boys' basketball team. He won a slam dunk contest in high school and he was nicknamed \"Dr. Dunk.\" He was a backup to the team's star center, Jason Collins, who went on to play in the NBA.\n\nSegel's first major role was as stoner \"freak\" Nick Andopolis on the critically acclaimed but short-lived 1999 NBC comedy-drama series \"Freaks and Geeks\". The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).\n\nSegel had recurring roles on \"\" as Neil Jansen and on \"Undeclared\" as Eric. He played Marshall Eriksen on the CBS sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\"; he had previously stated he would move on to other projects in 2013 when his contract expired, but was successfully convinced to finish the series after its ninth season in 2014.\n\nSegel made his film debut with \"Can't Hardly Wait\" in 1998. His other early feature film appearances include \"Slackers\", \"SLC Punk!\", \"The Good Humor Man\", and \"Dead Man on Campus\". In 2007, he appeared in \"Knocked Up\", directed by \"Freaks and Geeks\" producer Judd Apatow. Segel starred in the lead role of 2008's \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\", a film he wrote and Apatow produced with Shauna Robertson for Universal Pictures. He also starred in \"I Love You, Man\", which was released on March 20, 2009 by DreamWorks.\n\nIn \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\", Segel's character writes a \"Dracula\" musical performed by puppets. He also appeared in a full frontal nude scene in the film. In an interview, he stated that the Dracula musical with puppets, as well as being broken up with while naked, were real experiences he wrote into the movie. Those cloth creatures were custom-made by the Jim Henson Company, and the experience emboldened Segel to pitch his concept for a Muppets movie. Segel performed a song from the film, \"Dracula's Lament\", on the 1000th episode of \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\".\nFor the 2010 comedy \"Get Him to the Greek\", Segel co-wrote most of the soundtrack's music which was performed by the fictional band Infant Sorrow. He also appeared on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\" and sang an original song entitled \"Wonky Eyed Girl\".\n\nIn 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, \"Despicable Me\" and appeared as \"Horatio\" in a fantasy comedy film \"Gulliver's Travels\" directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in \"Bad Teacher\", starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis. Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest \"Muppets\" film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\", but after realizing that he was an avid fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was \"Muppets from Space\" in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.\n\nSegel decided not to star in the sequel to \"The Muppets\", \"Muppets Most Wanted\". He filmed \"The Five-Year Engagement\", with Emily Blunt, in spring 2011, in Michigan, and the film was released on April 27, 2012. Segel will also be in the cast of a film based on the 2012 Quebec maple syrup heist, which will be directed by Seth Gordon.\n\nIn 2013, Segel revealed he was working on a series of young adult novels, based on a story he conceived when he was 21. In the fall of 2014, the first novel of the series \"Nightmares!\", co-written with Kirsten Miller, was released, with the followup coming out the following year.\n\nIn 2015, Segel received praise for his portrayal of the late author David Foster Wallace in the independent biographical drama film \"The End of the Tour\". For his performance, he earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead.\n\nIn 2017, Segel and Miller released their first young adult novel, \"Otherworld\".\n\nSegel created and starred in the American drama television series \"Dispatches from Elsewhere\", which premiered on March 1, 2020, on AMC.\n\nSegel is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church. He performed a wedding ceremony on \"The Tonight Show\" on July 6, 2010, for a couple that solicited his services by placing pictures of him around his home town and the bar he frequently visited.\n\n"}

Wickham inherited nearly all of his father's large estate at age 22, including Robins Island. He lived in the Old House in Cutchogue, which was built in 1699. Currently a museum, it is said to be one of the oldest English-style houses still in existence in the USA. Wickham married Mary Goldsmith and had several children. He was the brother (and rival) of Patriot leader Thomas Wickham and the uncle of Federalist attorney John Wickham.\n\nIn 1751, Wickham was elected as Fence Viewer. He was elected in both 1754 and 1755 as Overseer of the Poor, and in 1763, he received an appointment as justice for the County of Suffolk. He was elected town assessor in 1765 and 1766, then elected nine times to the highest post of local government, town supervisor of the Town of Southold. In addition, he served as a major in the local militia.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Wickham was known for his pro-Loyalist views. He was kidnapped by Connecticut rebels on December 13, 1777, and placed on parole soon after. He was required to forfeit his property without compensation on October 22, 1779, after a bill of attainder was passed by New York's legislature. He was also banished from the state under threat of death. Wickham was forced to move to Connecticut, where he died. He insisted he was innocent of the charges, but he was never granted a trial. Acts of attainder were banned under the U.S. Constitution, adopted a few years after Wickham's death.\n\nShortly before his death in exile, Wickham wrote:\n\nI have acted consistently and consciously throughout my whole conduct, with a firm belief there is a future existence, and defy the state to produce one instance wherein I have acted rigidly, defrauded, or abused one member of it, although it was in my power.\n\nIn 1989, several of Wickham's heirs filed a lawsuit to try to regain ownership of Robins Island. Though the lawsuit failed, it discouraged development, and most of the island is now protected by an easement to The Nature Conservancy.\n\nWickham was buried in the Raymond Cemetery in Waterford, Connecticut.\n"}

{"id": "2146395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146395", "title": "Twisted Metal 4", "text": "Twisted Metal 4\n\nTwisted Metal 4 is a vehicular combat video game developed by 989 Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The game was released in North America on October 31, 1999 and was re-released for the Sony Greatest Hits line-up in 2000. Like the previous installment, it wasn't released in the PAL regions.\n\n\"Twisted Metal 4\" is the fourth installment in the \"Twisted Metal\" series and the second and last installment to be developed by 989 Studios. The game's plot centers on Sweet Tooth, the long-time mascot of the titular Twisted Metal competition, overthrowing Calypso, the mysterious organizer of the competition, in a coup d'état. He then takes over the mantle of granting the winner of the competition a single wish, regardless of price, size or even reality.\n\n\"Twisted Metal 4\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who considered it to be an improvement over the previous \"Twisted Metal III\", particularly in terms of level design.\n\nIn concept, \"Twisted Metal 4\" is a demolition derby which permits the usage of ballistic projectiles. Players choose a vehicle and an arena—or a series of arenas in the story mode—to engage in battle with opposing drivers. A variety of weapons are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage. The objective of the game is to be the last one standing.\n\nThe game's plot takes a different turn of events compared to its predecessors. Its intro video details the tournament's story, starting around the 1900s as a circus-type caravan that traveled across the country spreading destruction everywhere. A young Sweet Tooth finds himself amazed by the contest and runs off in its pursuit, entering and eventually winning. As his wish, he desires to become the star of Twisted Metal, which Calypso gladly grants. At first revered by the chaos he created, as time went on Sweet Tooth became jealous of Calypso, until he decides to initiate a coup d'état helped by a group of midget clowns, and takes control of Twisted Metal.\n\nIt is also discovered that Calypso's source of powers comes from a mysterious ring that consumes the souls of those who die, increasing his strength and youth, and Sweet Tooth having taken it, finds that he possess the same abilities as Calypso to grant wishes. He tends to cheat people with their wishes like Calypso does as well.\n\nAfter a contractual dispute with the developer of the first two games in the series, SingleTrac, \"Twisted Metal\" development duties were handed over to Sony's in-house development team, 989 Studios.\n\nIn development of \"Twisted Metal III\", the source code and physics engine for \"Twisted Metal 2\" weren't available because they were property of SingleTrac. Therefore, new ones had to be created from scratch instead. The new source code introduced advanced physics simulation and AI techniques to the series.\n\nIn development of \"Twisted Metal 4\", the game was reworked to improve upon the shortcomings of \"Twisted Metal III\", introducing smoother gameplay and softer physics. Levels were expanded further and an increased arsenal of weapons was created which would ultimately become exclusive to this game.\n\nThe game includes a total of 13 selectable characters from the start. Most characters were original characters created for the game, whereas a few of the returning characters appear as stage bosses without story. Unlike previous games in the series, each stage counts with its own boss (two bosses in The Oil Rig) to defeat in order to advance. Every boss becomes selectable after defeating the story mode at least once. The musician Rob Zombie is included in the playable characters due to the large amount of his songs on the previous installment in the series, \"Twisted Metal III\".\n\n\"Twisted Metal 4\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 68.04% on GameRankings. Brian of Game Revolution considered the game to be an improvement over \"Twisted Metal III\" and noted that the level design has improved from the previous installment, but cited some unsatisfactory levels and physics problems and the repetitive soundtrack as negative points. Joe Fielder of GameSpot also said that the game was a \"huge leap\" ahead of \"Twisted Metal III\", commenting on the improved level design, control and physics, but remarked that the latter two \"remain a little too touchy and unforgiving\" and that the graphics, while \"prettier\" than those of \"Twisted Metal III\", \"aren't nearly as sharp as the graphics in its current main competitor - Activision's \"\"\". Marc Nix of IGN commented negatively on the \"toy car\" control, look and sound of the vehicles, but noted the \"colorful\" graphics and \"well-done\" interactive environments.\n"}
{"id": "2146399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146399", "title": "Tatort", "text": "Tatort\n\nTatort (\"Crime scene\") is a German language police procedural television series that has been running continuously since 1970 with some 30 feature-length episodes per year, which makes it the longest-running German TV drama. Developed by the German public-service broadcasting organisation ARD for their channel Das Erste, it is unique in its approach, in that it is jointly produced by all of the organisation's regional members as well as its partnering Austrian and Swiss national public-service broadcasters, whereby every regional station contributes a number of episodes to a common pool.\n\nTherefore, the series is a collection of different police stories where different police teams each solve crimes in their respective city. Uniqueness in architecture, customs and dialects of the cities is therefore a distinctive part of the series and often the city, not the police force is the real main character of an episode. The concept of local stations only producing a couple of shows per year has also enabled the shows to be longer (90 minutes) and more fleshed out psychologically than other weekly TV dramas.\n\nThe first episode was broadcast on 29 November 1970. Episodes are broadcast on ARD's main channel Das Erste on Sunday evening at the prime viewing time of 8.15 pm (just after the 8 o'clock \"Tagesschau\" news) around three times a month. Reruns are often shown by various regional ARD stations and on foreign broadcasters. Alongside the member stations of the ARD, the national Austrian broadcasting corporation Österreichischer Rundfunk joined the production pool in 1971 and airs the program on its ORF 2 channel. Switzerland's Schweizer Fernsehen joined the pool from 1990 to 2001 and again in 2011 and distributes its episodes through its channel SRF 1.\n\nThe series \"Polizeiruf 110\", which was produced by East Germany’s state TV broadcaster as a counterpart to the West German \"Tatort\" and has a similar regional production approach, is still produced by ARD's regional broadcasters Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB), Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) and Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR). \"Polizeiruf 110\" shares the Sunday night prime time slot on \"Das Erste\" with \"Tatort\".\n\nThe main feature of \"Tatort\" is that it is jointly produced by all participating regional TV stations. Each of the eleven companies involved (the nine German regional TV channels or \"Landesrundfunkanstalten\" that together form ARD, plus ORF in Austria and SRF in Switzerland), produces its own episodes. Each station features usually more than one team of inspectors in different cities in its region, depending on the size of the producing broadcaster. Each of the roughly 20 active teams appears one to two times each year. Nearly every Sunday, a new episode from a different city premieres on \"Das Erste\"; old episodes are often shown through all participating stations as part of their common programming. The series shares this concept with its former East German counterpart \"Polizeiruf 110\", which basically is produced as four additional \"Tatort\" investigator teams aired under a different series name and opening credits by some regional broadcasters, mostly those which evolved from East German state television.\n\nEvery \"Tatort\" episode features a different team of inspectors in a different city. Combined with the fact that the episodes are, at 90 minutes long, almost movie-length and with rarely more than 30 episodes in one year, this makes for a cultural phenomenon closer to a string of made-for-TV movies than a typical police series.\n\nThis pooling concept was mainly due to the nature of the public broadcast television channel ARD, which is jointly operated by all of Germany's regional public \"Landesrundfunkanstalten\". The 9 regional public broadcasters collect broadcasting fees in their region of Germany (each region comprising one or more federal states), and each have multiple radio stations and a regional TV station. \"Das Erste\" is produced as a joint national channel with common national programming. Each regional broadcaster is responsible for parts of the programming, unlike for instance in the US with its network affiliate system. Usually one to three broadcasters produce one TV programme in cooperation. When \"Tatort\" was developed as a series of weekly feature film-long local crime stories, the stated concept was used to distribute financial and organizational efforts.\n\nApart from the unique joint-pooling system, the series is also characterised by the episode length of around 90 minutes, which allows for more in-depth and psychological fleshing out of the characters. Although almost all episodes feature the investigation of a homicide, it is never just a simple case of whodunit. Often the episode length allows for the crime to be shown in all its aspects, with equal attention focused on the perpetrators and the victims as on the inspectors. On several occasions the actual police work is just a side note in the story, as the main plot might focus on how one of the persons involved deals with the crime and its aftermath. Episodes also deal with social and political issues.\n\nWith the national broadcasting corporations of Austria and Switzerland participating, the episodes of \"Tatort\" are currently set in various cities of Germany, Vienna, and Lucerne. Originally each of the participating member stations limited their episodes to one team of investigators in one city: for ease of production this was mostly the city the broadcast station was in, but over the years some stations broadcasting over a large regional area have \"Tatort\"s playing in several cities. Notably, the WDR has three teams of investigators playing respectively in Cologne, Münster, and Dortmund. Episodes are either produced by the station's own production facilities, or are filmed and often also written by outside production houses on behalf of the station. This sometimes leads to situations where, for instance, a \"Tatort\" set in Thuringia is actually produced in Bavaria, with only a handful of scenes shot 'on location' in the town the story is supposed to be set in.\n\nA similar concept of independently filming and then pooling episodes was used from 1988 to 1992 in the series Eurocops, jointly produced by several national European TV stations.\n\n\"Tatort\" has not found wide distribution in non-German speaking countries, but some episodes were distributed as stand-alone mini series. Most notably the 2013 series starring Til Schweiger and Fahri Ogün Yardım in Hamburg was distributed by Channel 4 under the title \"Nick's Law\".\n\nGunther Witte, dramatist and TV head at WDR (West German Broadcasting Cologne), developed the series against initial resistance. Witte and his successors have ensured that one or two detectives are at the center of every story, and the cases are shown from their perspective; they are usually members of a team, and their lives are also included.\n\nIn January 2008 a similarly produced series of radio dramas called \"ARD Radio Tatort\" was introduced, new episodes are aired monthly by regional radio stations, but not at the same time.\n\nIn 2012, more than 100,000 people participated in the first and only online game linked to the SWR \"Tatort\" production, \"Der Wald steht schwarz und schweiget\".\n\nIn January 2014, \"Tatort\" received the 50th Grimme Award.\n\nThe show is still aired on Sundays at 8:15 p.m. in Germany and Austria, and 8:05 p.m. in Switzerland. About 30 episodes are made each year. By May 2018, 1055 episodes had been produced, plus 13 made in Austria and shown only there. Episode nr. 1000 was broadcast on Sunday 13 November 2016.\n\nThe episodes of some series of \"Tatort\", such as the discontinued series about Schimanski, played by Götz George, have become cultural icons.\n\nThe opening sequence of each episode has essentially remained the same throughout the decades except for slight changes. Klaus Doldinger composed the title music with Udo Lindenberg on drums.\n\nAt the same time the ARD was starting its \"Tatort\" format, the DDR had its own police procedural/crime show called \"Polizeiruf 110\" (\"Police dial 1-1-0\"). The series premiered in 1971, less than a year after the first \"Tatort\". It too was a police procedural, with various teams of investigators in various cities of the DDR, but in contrast to the West, only a small part of their cases involved actual homicides. The psychology of the perpetrators and the victims was also more prevalent. The series continued through all of the 1970s and 80s and even survived the Wende, continuing until 1991.\n\nIn 1990, \"Polizeiruf\" practiced its own brand of German unification with episode 142, (\"Amongst Brothers\"), a crossover with the \"Tatort\" investigators Schimanski and Thanner (this was co-produced with ARD and a medley of the two series themes were used in the opening intro). Until 1991, the series continued more or less independently for 11 more episodes until episode 153 (22 December 1991), again a crossover, in which Kommissar Thanner becomes the team's superior. Also in 1991, as part of the unification, the DDR's television company DFF was split into the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) and Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB) while the television stations in the new state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern would be operated as part of the NDR.\n\nAs MDR, ORB and NDR were all partners in the ARD, it was expected that they would start producing \"Tatort\" episodes as well. However, seeing the popularity of \"Polizeiruf 110\", it was decided that the stations would contribute to the \"Tatort\" pool, but that its episodes would keep the name of \"Polizeiruf 110\" and their own title music and intro. Still, they would be broadcast over all ARD stations on Sunday evening just like (or instead of) the 'western' \"Tatort\".\n\nReorganising took one and a half years, but on 13 June 1993, the now MDR restarted the series in \"Tatort\" format. This first episode played in Leipzig, just as in 1991. However, today's episodes produced by the MDR play in Magdeburg, while those produced by NDR play in Rostock. The ORB (and later ORB's successor, RBB) has its episodes headed by the same team of investigators, but take place in various cities of Brandenburg. In addition, Bavarian Broadcasting station BR produces its own \"Polizeiruf\" episodes playing in Munich next to its \"Tatort\" episodes playing in the same city. Like the original, the Bavarian \"Polizeiruf\" episodes focus more on the psychology of the crimes and more on crimes other than homicides. Over the years several other 'western' local broadcasts tried their hands at producing \"Polizeiruf\" episodes as a line of 'alternative Tatort' next to the regular ones. However, all of them stopped after a few episodes.\n\nOn 15 May 2015, RBB aired the 350th episode of \"Polizeiruf 110\", the 197th episode of the new format.\n\nIn 2013, seeing that Thuringia was so far the only federal state in Germany that had neither a \"Tatort\" nor a \"Polizeiruf\" playing in one of its cities, the MDR ordered two new series under the \"Tatort\" header, playing in Erfurt and in Weimar respectively. Both are produced for the MDR by Bavarian companies.\n\nAs 1-1-0 is the speed dial code for police/emergency dispatch in Germany, but not in Austria, \"Polizeiruf 110\" is broadcast in Austria as \"Polizeiruf 133\".\n\nThere have been over 1100 episodes of Tatort, from November 1970 up to the beginning of January 2020 these have been the product of a dozen broadcasters, based around various lead investigators. While some (about 30) have featured only once or twice, a number of investigators have featured in multiple episodes. There are 22 current investigative strands, and three have been the subject of over 70 episodes.\n\nLast update: April 26, 2020\n\nSome \"Tatort\" episodes from the 1980s and 1990s included songs that subsequently became quite well known, and two of them reached the top of the charts:\n\"Faust auf Faust (Schimanski)\" by Klaus Lage from the \"Tatort\" movie \"\", and \"Midnight Lady\" by Chris Norman, written by Dieter Bohlen, which appears on the episode .\nSome random selected soundtracks:\n\n\n"}

His father was a factory electric power engineer. Day graduated from Cathedral Preparatory Seminary in New York City, and attended Manhattan College in the Bronx, where he sang in the glee club.\n\nIn 1939 Gene McNulty, as Day was then known, sang on network radio with bandleader Larry Clinton. The Clinton broadcasts were aimed at the collegiate audience, and were often broadcast from a college campus. The 23-year-old McNulty won an audience poll as a favorite vocalist.\n\nDay appeared for the first time on Jack Benny's radio show on October 8, 1939, taking the place of another tenor, Kenny Baker. He remained associated with Benny's radio and television programs until Benny's death in 1974. He was introduced (with actress Verna Felton playing his overbearing mother) as a young (nineteen-year-old), naive boy singer – a character he kept through his whole career.\n\nMary Livingstone, Benny's wife, brought the singer to Benny's attention after hearing Day on the radio during a visit to New York. She took a recording of Day's singing to Benny, who then went to New York to audition Day. The audition resulted in Day's role on the Benny program.\n\nDay's first recorded song was \"Goodnight My Beautiful\".\n\nBesides singing, Day was a mimic. On the Benny program, Day performed impressions of various celebrities of the era, including Ronald Colman, Jimmy Durante and James Stewart.\n\nFrom 1944 through 1946 he served in the United States Navy as a Lieutenant. While in service he was temporarily replaced on the Benny radio program by fellow tenor Larry Stevens. On his return to civilian life, he continued to work with Benny while also starring on his own NBC show, \"A Day in the Life of Dennis Day\" (1946–1951). On Benny's show, Day's having two programs in comparison to Benny's one was the subject of numerous jokes and gags, usually revolving around Day rubbing Benny's, and sometimes other cast members' and guest stars' noses in that fact (e.g., \"Dennis, why do you have two horns on your bicycle?\" \"Why shouldn't I? I've got two shows!\"). His last radio series was a comedy and variety show that aired on NBC's Sunday afternoon schedule during the 1954–55 season.\n\nWhen Day got his own radio sitcom, he continued to play essentially the same character that he originated on Benny's program. However, for this series, Day lived in the fictional town of Weaverville. He stayed at a boarding house run by Clara Anderson, played by Bea Benaderet. Her henpecked husband, Herbert Anderson, was voiced by Dink Trout. Day was engaged to their daughter Mildred, played by Barbara Eiler. His character worked at Willoughby's Drug Store, where his boss was Mr. Willoughby. The show was sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive. Verne Smith was the announcer, while music was provided by Bud Dant and his orchestra. The format of the show would begin with a song by Day, followed by the first half of the plot, a second song by Day in the middle of the episode, the rest of the plot, and then a third song by Day to finish the episode. Episodes can be heard regularly on the Sirius XM Radio Classics Channel.\n\nAn attempt was made to adapt \"A Day in the Life Of Dennis Day\" as an NBC filmed series (Sam Berman's caricature of Dennis was used in the opening and closing titles), produced by Jerry Fairbanks for Dennis' sponsor, Colgate-Palmolive, featuring the original radio cast, but got no farther than an unaired 1949 pilot episode. In late 1950, a sample kinescope was produced by Colgate and their ad agency showcasing Dennis as host of a projected \"live\" comedy/variety series (\"The Dennis Day Show\") for CBS, but that, too, went unsold. He continued to appear as a regular cast member when \"The Jack Benny Program\" became a TV series, staying with the show until it ended in 1965.\nEventually, his own TV series, \"The Dennis Day Show\" (aka \"The RCA Victor Show\"), was first telecast on NBC on February 8, 1952, and then in the 1953–1954 season. Between 1952 and 1978, he made numerous TV appearances as a singer and actor (such as NBC's \"The Gisele MacKenzie Show\" and ABC's \"The Bing Crosby Show\" and \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\") and voice for animation, such as the Walt Disney feature \"Johnny Appleseed\", handling multiple characters.\n\nDuring the final season of \"The Jack Benny Program\" (1964–65), Day was nearly 49 years old, although Benny was still delivering such lines as \"That crazy kid drives me nuts ...\"\n\nHis last televised work with Benny was in 1970, when they appeared in a public service announcement together to promote savings and loans. This was shortly after the whole cast and crew of \"The Jack Benny Show\" had joined for \"Jack Benny's Twentieth Anniversary Special\".\n\nIn 1972, he co-starred with June Allyson and Judy Canova in the First National Tour of the Broadway musical \"No, No, Nanette\".\n\nIn 1976, Day was the voice of \"The Preacher\" in the Rankin-Bass production \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\" and again worked with them in 1978, when he voiced Fred in \"The Stingiest Man in Town\", which was their animated version of Charles Dickens' novel \"A Christmas Carol\".\n\nHe also appeared in \"Date with the Angels\" – Season 1, Episode 13 as himself. Aired Friday 9:30 pm October 25, 1957 on ABC – some records show it was episode 19, titled Star Struck.\n\nAlthough his career was mainly radio and TV-based, Day also appeared in a few films. These included \"Buck Benny Rides Again\" (1940) opposite Jack Benny, \"Sleepy Lagoon\" (1943), \"Music in Manhattan\" (1944), \"I'll Get By\" (1950), \"Golden Girl\" (1951), \"The Girl Next Door\" (1953), and \"Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood\" (1976) as a singing telegraph man. For the soundtrack of \"My Wild Irish Rose\" (1947), a biopic about Chauncey Olcott, Day provided the singing voice to the acting of Dennis Morgan.\n\nIn 1948, Day married Peggy Almquist; the marriage lasted until his death in 1988. The couple had ten children. His brother Jim McNulty, two years younger, was married to actress and singer Ann Blyth.\n\nA Republican, Day was supportive of Dwight Eisenhower's campaign during the 1952 presidential election.\n\nDay died on June 22, 1988, of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease), in Los Angeles, California.

Fighters were intentionally made to not be exact replicas of real-world fighters as it would make the game overly-complex for their target audience. Much of the music was provided by Kohta Takahashi, being heavily inspired by \"Top Gun\".\n\n\"Ace Combat 2\" was a commercial success, selling over 500,000 copies in Japan alone by May of 1998. It was commended by critics for its gameplay, graphics, variety in missions and for being a major improvement over its predecessor. Some also called it one of the best flight-sim games on the PlayStation. The lack of a multiplayer mode and its high-difficulty level were the subject of criticism. It was re-released as a budget title in Japan in 1999 under Sony's \"The Best\" label, and was included in the 2005 compilation \"NamCollection\" for the PlayStation 2. A remake for the Nintendo 3DS, \"\", was released in 2011.\n\n\"Ace Combat 2\" is a combat flight simulator video game. It is presented in a more arcade-like format in contrast to other flight-sim games. The player controls one of 24 different fighter jets through 21 different missions, each having different objectives to complete; these include intercepting a squadron of enemies, destroying a specific aircraft carrier, or protecting a base from enemy fire. Completing missions awards the player money which can be spent on new aircraft in their personal hangar.\n\nBeginning at the game's fourth mission is the ability to allow a wingman to fly with the player, which provide additional support and will help them in completing the objective. The game begins in a mostly linear format, with branching mission paths being available later on. A fuel meter acts as a time limit and will deplete as the player flies around the level and attacks enemies; the mission will automatically end if the meter fully depletes. New to this game are \"aces\", elite enemy pilots that can be fought to unlock special medals and their special aircraft for play later. Two difficulty options are present, \"Novice\" and \"Expert\", with Expert allowing for realistic aircraft maneuvers such as rolls and high-g turns.\n\n\"Ace Combat 2\" was the creation of Namco designer Masanori Kato, who previously worked on the game's predecessor \"Air Combat\", and a small team of others. The idea for the game came from Kato's dissatisfaction with the outcome of \"Air Combat\", which he saw as incomplete from a technical point of view. Kato and his team decided to create a follow-up to make the best use of the PlayStation's hardware as possible, with an emphasis on graphics and making the player feel as if they're really flying a fightercraft. One of the first things the team wanted to improve on were the graphics, doing technical research on how many polygons the console could display. The team created a program that was able to output as many polygons as possible without causing restraint on the hardware, which allowed the graphics to be of significantly higher-quality than most other games. The team also looked into including a large variety of missions, as opposed to \"Air Combat\"s two mission types. Missions were designed to be exciting and fun to play, and when new fighters were added the team determined if they would make the missions more interesting or not. The gameplay itself was designed in the style of an arcade game instead of being strictly a flight-simulation game, which they felt made the game much more fun.\n\nKato and his team used books on planes and aviation-related magazines as reference when creating new fighters. They also watched several films on air combat and traveled to the American Armed Force airshow to take photographs of the planes on display. To make the game less complex for their target audience, the team decided that the fighters would have different data from that of their real-world counterparts. A simplistic law of physics system was implemented in their place, which kept the game's realism while still providing a user-friendly experience. The team looked into getting advice from a real airplane pilot to refine the gameplay, but were unable to do so. Ideas for missions were from Kato and the team's imaginations, although he stated he wished they were able to travel to real-world places to gather data and references. Environments were created to be visually-impressive and interesting. The development team experimented with a level design that would involve the player attempting to de-rail a trail through a mountain valley, but it was ultimately dropped due to technical and graphical restraints. The overall level structure was tweaked slightly so that the strategy in missions would not feel awkward or unnatural. At the beginning of development, the team wanted the game to support analogue control, adding support for both the PlayStation DualShock and the Namco NeGcon, and later the PlayStation Analog Joystick.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Ace Combat 2\", composed by Kohta Takahashi and a team of five others, was heavily inspired by \"Top Gun\". Takahashi wanted the music to be 'simulating' and intense, but made sure it had its own distinct flare to prevent it from sounding too similar to \"Top Gun\". The composers also made sure it reflected the designs and objectives of each mission. Most of the sound effects were directly taken from a special-effects CD one of the composers had, while others were entirely original. \n\n\"Ace Combat 2\" was released in Japan on May 30, 1997, later released in North America on July 31 and in Europe on October 24. The game was re-released as a budget title in Japan on July 29, 1999 as part of Sony's \"The Best\" budget label. It is included in the 2005 video game compilation \"NamCollection\" for the PlayStation 2 alongside four other Namco PlayStation game ports, in celebration of the company's 50th anniversary.\n\n\"Ace Combat 2\" was a commercial success; in May 1998, Sony gave the game the \"Gold Prize\" award for selling over 500,000 copies in Japan. It won several awards from video game publications, including the \"Silver Hall of Fame\" from \"Famitsu\", \"Editor's Choice\" from \"IGN\", and \"Game of the Month\" from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\". It holds an 83 out of 100 on reviewer aggregator website Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nThe game was well-received by critics. Crispin Boyer of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" applauded the draw distance, while \"Computer and Video Games\" called it \"The most intense flight experience to ever grace a console\". \"Next Generation\" said that it would \"keep a whole bunch of weekend warriors strapped in to the TV\", while \"IGN\" labeled it \"one of the best flight simulators ever to come to the PlayStation\" and said that Namco went \"all out\" with its visuals. The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" felt the game's strongest point was its variety, with multiple planes to choose from and unlock and widely varying mission objectives. Publications commended the quality of the gameplay for its fast-pace and variety in missions, although \"AllGame\" and \"Computer and Video Games\" felt it became \"monotonous\" and tiring after a while. Jeff Gerstmann of \"Gamespot\" argued that the low difficulty level ensures the game is over too quickly in spite of the large number of missions. However, the majority of critics contended that the enemy artificial intelligence is extremely advanced and responds to player movements, making the game's difficulty, if anything, overly high. The game's consistently high frame rate and environmental visuals were subjects of praise.\n\nMany publications agreed that \"Ace Combat 2\" was a vast improvement over its predecessor, with \"IGN\", \"Electric Playground\" and \"GamePro\" all commending Namco for successfully updating the gameplay in the original to make it much more action-packed and entertaining. \"Next Generation\" said it was an excellent follow-up to \"Air Combat\", with \"Famitsu\" adding that it made for one of the best sequel games the company had put out on the PlayStation. Several also liked the game's controls for being responsive and smooth; \"Next Generation\" credited the game's support for the PlayStation Analog Joystick, which they felt made the game even more realistic than it was before. While some criticized the lack of a multiplayer mode, \"Computer and Video Games\" argued that the removal of a two-player option was a good idea, feeling that it allowed Namco to refine the gameplay and stages in general. \"Electric Playground\" and \"AllGame\" both praised the large selection of playable fighters, with \"AllGame\" also applauding its usage of secrets and unlockable extras.\n\nA remake for the Nintendo 3DS, \"\", was released in 2011 in North America and Europe, and in 2012 in Japan, where it was renamed \"Ace Combat 3D: Cross Rumble\". \"Assault Horizon Legacy\" features a complete revamp of the game's storyline, alongside the addition of cutscenes, voice acting and remade level designs. It also adds several new fighters not found in the original, including the Boeing F-15SE Silent Eagle and the Sukhoi PAK FA. Despite its namesake, it has very little in common with its predecessor \"\". It was followed by a 2015 update called \"Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy +\", adding amiibo support and updated control handling for the New Nintendo 3DS.\n\n"}

It was released as a launch title for the system in North America.\n\n\"Air Combat\" is a combat flight simulator video game. It is presented in a more arcade-like format in stark contrast to other flight sim games. The player controls one of sixteen different aircraft, including the F-4 Phantom, Su-27 Flanker, and even Stealth aircraft, and must complete each of the game's seventeen levels, each having mission objectives that must be fulfilled. Missions range from destroying a squadron of enemy fighters, protecting an allied base from enemy fire, or destroying a massive battleship. Completing missions awards the player money, which can be used to purchase new fighters in their own personal hangar. Extra money can also be earned by destroying optional, \"non-target\" enemies.\n\nBeginning at the game's fourth mission, a wingman can be employed into battle that will help protect the player and fight alongside them. Additional wingmen can be hired by earning additional money during combat. The game progresses in a linear format. Alongside the main single-player campaign, there is also a split-screen multiplayer deathmatch mode, where two players attempt to destroy each other in the quickest time possible. Players can also unlock new fighters and special minigames by completing specific objectives at various points throughout the game. Players can also swap between a first-person and third-person camera option.\n\nA terrorist force starts an uprising (and inflicts massive damage across an unidentified country, later retconned to Skully Island which is part of the continent of Usea); efforts to defeat these terrorists through conventional means have failed and the situation turns desperate. In response, a mercenary air force is assembled to take the fight against the enemy and free the nation from the terrorist forces.\n\n\"Air Combat\" proved to be a commercial success for Namco. In Japan alone, the game sold over 246,000 copies in its first week, and nearly 600,000 overall. By 2008 the game sold over 2.23 million copies, making it the best-selling game in the franchise behind \"\". \"Famitsu\" awarded it the \"Silver Hall of Fame\" award, while \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" awarded it \"Best Flight Sim of 1995\".\n\nCritics focused primarily on the gameplay, who felt it had an addictive, arcade-like nature. \"GameFan\" described it as \"easily the ultimate flight simulator\". \"IGN\", who compared it favorably to \"Warhawk\", praised its gameplay for being action-packed, as did \"Allgame\" and \"Coming Soon\". \"Allgame\" also liked the game's addictiveness and longevity. \"Famitsu\" stated that the game was fun and had a lot of variety and action, but could have used additional levels. Several critics argued that the game started off at a slow and boring pace at the beginning, but became very fun after a while; \"GamePro\" wrote that patient players would \"gradually get caught up in the gripping gameplay\". In their brief coverage of the game in 1997, \"Next Generation\" argued that the game didn't hold up well in comparison to other games, saying that it was a decent flight sim but not as fun as its competitors. The controls were also praised, with \"Coming Soon\" and \"Famitsu\" saying it made it one of the most realistic flight sims for a console. \"Air Combat\" was also praised for its cinematic cutscenes, realistic sound effects, and amount of unlockables.\n\nThe graphics and presentation of \"Air Combat\" were criticized, with reviewers finding them to be of poor quality. \"Allgame\" showed confusion towards this, due to Namco's other PlayStation games from the time having high-resolution graphics. \"IGN\" said the graphics, which they criticized for their constant flickering, were the game's weakest point, alongside its poor presentation. \"GamePro\" also criticized the visuals for being bland and unappealing. By a stark contrast, both \"GameFan\" and \"Coming Soon\" praised them for their realism and detail. Like \"IGN\", \"Famitsu\" also stated the graphics were the game's low point, arguing that its arcade predecessor \"Air Combat 22\" had much better visuals. Critics liked the game's mission variety in later levels for not simply repeating previous ones. \"Allgame\" in particular said that it gave the game a lot of replay value for this reason, as did \"Famitsu\". \"GamePro\" labeled them as being \"polished\", but argued that the earlier ones were rather boring. The soundtrack also received praise, with \"Allgame\" listing it among the game's best features.\n\n\"Air Combat\" spawned one of Namco's most-successful franchises, which retained the Japanese name of \"Ace Combat\" for all regions. It laid down the basic foundations for the series, and is seen as an important and influential game in the combat flight simulator genre. The first sequel was \"Ace Combat 2\" in 1997, adding new missions, fightercraft, and the ability to perform high-g turns. It was followed by the futuristic-themed \"\" in 1999, which employed a branching storyline that changed based on player decision. \"\" was published for the PlayStation 2 in 2001, succeeded by \"\" in 2004, the final \"Ace Combat\" game developed by Namco. The then-newly-formed Namco Bandai Games released \"\" in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, and \"\" for the Xbox 360 in 2007, the latter being the first in the series to incorporate online multiplayer and downloadable content. \"\" was released in 2011 for multiple platforms, followed by the online multiplayer game \"Ace Combat Infinity\" in 2012. Bandai Namco Entertainment released \"\" in 2019, which added virtual reality support.\n\nSeveral handheld spin-offs were also produced. \"Ace Combat Advance\" was released in 2005 for the Game Boy Advance in North America and Europe, being the only game in the series to not see a release in Japan. In 2006, \"\" was released for the PlayStation Portable, utilizing the system's download play functionality to support multiplayer. \"\" was published in 2009 for iOS devices; it has since been removed from the App Store. A sequel to \"Ace Combat\", titled \"\", was released in 2010 for the PlayStation Portable. \"\" was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012; despite the title, it bears little to no relation with the original \"Assault Horizon\". \"Legacy\" was re-released in 2015 as \"Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy +\", adding support for amiibo and control handling for the New Nintendo 3DS.\n"}

{"id": "2146430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146430", "title": "Gran Turismo 2", "text": "Gran Turismo 2\n\n\"Gran Turismo 2\" is fundamentally based on the racing game genre. The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose vehicles they wish to use, and can enable damage. However, the simulation mode requires the player to earn driver's licenses, pay for vehicles, and earn trophies in order to unlock new and returning courses. \"Gran Turismo 2\" features nearly 650 automobiles and 27 racing tracks, including rally tracks.\n\nCompared with \"Gran Turismo\", the gameplay, physics and graphics are very similar: the only real noticeable difference in vehicle dynamics was the brakes, which became much less likely to lock up and cause the vehicle to oversteer. The major changes are the vastly expanded number of cars, tracks and races in simulation mode. Other differences include that the player can race events separately, if they do not want to enter the whole tournament. The player is no longer able to \"qualify\" for each race entered.\n\nAfter the unexpected success of \"Gran Turismo\", lead developer Kazunori Yamauchi planned to make \"Gran Turismo 2\" \"an even better product\". SCEA's marketing director (Ami Blaire) had high hopes, stating \"the overwhelming and continuing popularity of \"Gran Turismo\" clearly positions \"Gran Turismo 2\" to be one of the hottest titles available for the holidays and beyond\". Jack Tretton (sales vice president of SCEA) had similar enthusiasm, expecting \"Gran Turismo 2\" to \"fly off the shelves faster than the original, continuing the momentum of this incredible franchise\".\n\nUpon the game's release, players shortly found various errors and glitches. SCEA did not ignore the outcry, and offered a replacement if any problems occurred. For example, in version 1.0 of the NTSC-U version of the game, the maximum attainable completion percentage was 98.2%. Another glitch was that no matter what, even if a player saves the game, cars can disappear from their garage. A third glitch was that certain cars would appear in the wrong races. This was most significant in the 30-lap Trial Mountain endurance race, where a 680 bhp Vector M12 LM edition may appear despite a 295-horsepower entry restriction, effectively making the race nearly impossible to win.\nThe reason for the maximum completion percentage falling short is due to a planned drag racing mode that was never implemented.\n\nAt the time of its release, GT2 featured one of the largest lists of then new and historic cars available in a single computer game, tallied at nearly 650 cars. GT2 contained 36 manufacturers, ranging from Acura (NTSC-U version only; other versions used the Honda brand name), BMW, Peugeot to Venturi. In comparison, the original Gran Turismo and GT3 A-Spec had fewer than 200 each. For the first time in the series, manufacturers from France, Germany, and Italy were added, in turn allowing for a global Gran Turismo championship. Certain notable manufacturers, such as Ferrari and Porsche, were not featured since the required licenses could not be obtained. Ruf was added as an alternative to Porsche: Ruf is a separate manufacturer from Porsche under U.S. and German law. Certain cars, such as the Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR, were also cut from the game due to licensing issues.\n\nGran Turismo 2 was the first game of the series to feature the Vauxhall/Opel brands. In the NTSC-U (Americas) and NTSC-J (Japan) versions, the Opel brand was used, whilst the PAL (Europe) version featured Vauxhall when the game is set to use English language, with Opel being available in other languages. This led to a loophole in which the player could complete the one-make races for both Opel and Vauxhall, giving a completion score of 100.91%.\n\nThe opening song for the North American and PAL versions is \"My Favourite Game\" by The Cardigans. The PAL version has the Faithless Remix of the song. In some introductions of the North American releases, the song was cut such that it played differently after one minute. The opening song for the Japanese version is \"Moon Over the Castle\" (the Gran Turismo series theme).\n\nThe game further increased the number of tracks on-disc by separating Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode for the PAL and Japanese versions) into two discs. This allowed for more space to place audio. The PAL version has a different soundtrack, and has songs that the American version doesn't, such as \"Illin' in Heaven\" by Fatboy Slim. The American version has songs such as \"I Think I'm Paranoid\" by Garbage, and \"Now is the Time\" by The Crystal Method, whereas the PAL version did not.\n\n\"Gran Turismo 2\" received critical acclaim from review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nGameSpot rated it 8.5 out of 10, recommending it to any gamer, car enthusiast or not, while IGN rated the game a 9.8/10. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 34 out of 40. \"Gran Turismo 2\" was a bestseller for two months in Japan, and for two months in the UK, and has sold 9.37 million copies worldwide. \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" listed the game as the 4th best of all time. It received a \"Double Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nDan Egger of \"Next Generation\" rated it four stars out of five, and stated that \"The rushed production of this game botched what could have been a near perfect sequel. As it stands, \"Gran Turismo 2\" is still the best racer ever made. Imagine what it could have been if Sony hadn't bungled the release.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2146435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146435", "title": "Balboa Park station", "text": "Balboa Park station\n\nBalboa Park is a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Muni Metro station complex located south of Balboa Park in southern San Francisco, California. It is an intermodal hub served by four BART routes, three Muni Metro lines, and a number of Muni bus routes. The station complex also includes two rail yards, Cameron Beach Yard and Green Light Rail Center, where Muni maintains Muni Metro trains and heritage streetcars. BART uses a below-grade island platform on the west side of the complex; Muni Metro routes use several smaller side platforms located on surface-level rail loops around the yards.\n\nThe San Francisco and San Jose Railroad opened in 1863, with Elkton station located near the modern site. Passenger service on the line (later the Southern Pacific Railroad Ocean View Branch) ran until about 1922. Electric streetcar service at Balboa Park began in 1892 with the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway, which built a still-standing office building designed by Reid & Reid there in 1901. The United Railroads conglomerate built its Elkton shops on an adjacent parcel in 1907. In the 1960s, BART decided to use the Ocean View Branch right-of-way for part of a rapid transit system. The San Francisco portion of BART, including Balboa Park station, opened on November 5, 1973.\n\nBoth streetcar facilities were replaced by modern yards in the 1970s and 1980s. Muni Metro service to the Balboa Park complex began with the K Ingleside line in 1979, followed by the M Ocean View line in 1980 and the J Church line in 1991. In the early 2000s, BART and Muni began planning renovations to improve the accessibility of the station and its connections to the surrounding neighborhoods. A new BART entrance was completed in 2011, followed by new Muni platforms in 2015 and 2017 and an additional footbridge in 2018. Additional improvements like more elevators and modernized headhouses are proposed. The 1901-built office building and an adjacent powerhouse, both abandoned since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, are planned to be renovated as a community center.\n\nThe Balboa Park station complex is centered around an irregular quadrilateral bounded by Ocean Avenue to the north, the Interstate 280 (I-280) cut to the west, Geneva Avenue to the south, and San Jose Avenue to the east. The BART platform—a island platform—is located below grade on the west side of the complex. It stretches from Ocean Avenue to slightly south of Geneva Avenue. The northern third of the platform, plus a small section at the southern end, is in an open trench; the remainder is under Geneva Avenue and the headhouse structure. The main entrance, located on the north side of Geneva Avenue, leads to a below-street-level fare control area in a mezzanine over the middle of the BART platform. Additional entrances from the south side of Geneva Avenue (via an underpass) and from San Jose Avenue at Geneva Avenue (the Muni entrance) also lead to the fare control area. From the two paid areas in the mezzanine, stairs and escalators connect to the platform. An accessible ramp from Ocean Avenue runs along the west side of the station to a secondary fare control area at the north end of the north paid area. An elevator on the north side of Geneva Avenue connects to the south paid area and the platform.\n\nA Muni Metro rail yard, the Curtis E. Green Light Rail Center, takes up the rest of the block. The east half is occupied by a maintenance building and the west half by open storage tracks, with an administrative building at the south end. Muni J Church and K Ingleside trains loop around the outer edge of the yard. Trains enter from Ocean Avenue and drop off passengers at a high-level platform (which is connected to the BART fare mezzanine and the path top San Jose Avenue with a ramp) on the west side of the yard. They lay over on a pair of tracks on the south side of the yard, then pick up passengers at a high-level platform on the east side of the yard adjacent to San Jose Avenue. J Church trains exit the yard there onto tracks on San Jose Avenue (with a separate stop at Ocean Avenue), while K Ingleside trains continue around the loop and exit where they entered.\n\nA second Muni rail yard, the Cameron Beach Yard, is located south of Geneva Avenue and east of San Jose Avenue. It includes a maintenance building, a storage shelter for historic streetcars, open storage tracks, and a currently-abandoned office building and powerhouse. M Ocean View loop around Cameron Beach Yard; the last stop for outbound trains is at San Jose and Niagara, one block to the south of Geneva Avenue. The stop does not have a platform; if a passenger needs an accessible platform to alight, the train will proceed across Geneva Avenue to a mini-high platform located at Seneca Avenue. Inbound trains pick up passengers at San Jose and Geneva, which has a concrete platform with a wayside lift for accessibility, after proceeding around the yard loop. An unused set of storage tracks, the Upper Yard, is located on the west side of San Jose Avenue.\n\nBalboa Park is a major transfer point for Muni buses, with over 13,000 daily boardings by a 2008 survey. Routes , , , , , , and stop on Geneva Avenue next to the BART station entrances. Routes and stop on Ocean Avenue at I-280 and at San Jose Avenue. Route stops on San Jose Avenue next to the inbound M stop. The 28R stop is also used by the early-morning , , , and routes, and several shuttles including the Brisbane-Crocker Park Shuttle and the SamTrans Daly City Bayshore Shuttle.\n\nThe San Francisco and San Jose Railroad (SF&SJ) opened through San Francisco on October 16, 1863, and was merged into the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) in 1868. The line had several stops within San Francisco, including Elkton, located on the east side of the tracks south of Ocean Avenue. It was primarily a freight station for nearby farms, though it also served the nearby Industrial School as well as residential neighborhoods that were laid out in the 1860s. However, the railroad was not very useful to local residents: high fares discouraged both passengers and freight, and on-street running in the Mission District made the ride slow. After the SP opened the faster Bayshore Cutoff in 1907, the original mainline through San Francisco was reduced to a minor freight branch (the Ocean View Branch) with minimal passenger service.\n\nSP passenger service on the Ocean View Branch was limited to a few daily locals after 1907, and just one daily round trip after June 1919. Regular passenger service on the branch ended around 1922, though freight service continued. The tracks were abandoned north of Ocean Avenue (up to 23rd Street) on August 10, 1942, and south of Ocean Avenue (to at least Daly City) after a 1956 excursion train. The Southern Freeway was constructed partially on the abandoned right-of-way in the 1960s; the section through Balboa Park was completed in 1964. As part of the highway, pedestrian ramps were built at Ocean Avenue to allow passengers on highway express buses to transfer to local transit.\n\nElectric streetcar service began with the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway (SF&SM) on San Jose Avenue on April 27, 1892. It was followed in December 1895 by a Market Street Railway spur on Ocean Avenue, branching off their Mission Street line. In 1900, the SF&SM bought land on the southeast corner of San Jose Avenue and Geneva Avenue to construct its main facilities. Construction began on July 14, 1900. A office building along San Jose Avenue—designed by Reid & Reid—opened on April 22, 1901, followed by an adjacent powerhouse in 1903. The SF&SM and the Market Street Railway were both absorbed into the United Railroads (URR) congolmerate in 1902. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the URR rerouted the San Mateo line to Mission Street; Embarcadero–Daly City route 26 continued to operate on San Jose Avenue.\n\nIn 1907, while expanding its streetcar network after the |previous year's earthquake]], the URR hurriedly opened its Elkton shops next to the SP's Elkton station. The shops occupied a parcel bounded by San Jose Avenue to the east, the SP line to the west, Ocean Avenue to the north, and Geneva Avenue to the south. The SP line was used to deliver materials to the yard. On September 16, 1909, the SF&SM yard was renamed Geneva Yard. The powerhouse, damaged in the earthquake, was rebuilt in 1910. In 1917, during a violent strike of URR operators, strike-brakers were temporarily housed in the office building. A wooden staircase was constructed from the second floor directly to the carbarn.\n\nThe URR was renamed as the Market Street Railway in 1921, and purchased by the city-owned San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) in 1944. The merger and the impending end of World War II (which had limited the availability of rubber tires) prompted the conversion of many streetcar routes to bus or trolleybus. Route 26 had previously been discontinued in 1938 and soon replaced by a branch (itself closed on November 5, 1939) of the route 9 streetcar. Route 26 service resumed on September 23, 1944, but was replaced by buses on February 4, 1945, ending streetcar service on San Jose Avenue. Muni's K Ingleside line was extended on Ocean Avenue and Onondaga Street to Mission Street on April 8, 1945, as the ex-MSR line on Ocean Avenue was converted to bus. K Ingleside service was cut back to Phelan Loop on October 10, 1952; however, Geneva Yard was retained as the yard for the remaining streetcar system. The southern portion of the Elkton lot, as well as the parcel across Geneva Avenue to the south, were used for bus storage.\n\nEven before the Ocean View Branch was abandoned, several proposals for rapid transit aimed to use the Ocean View Branch route (usually in conjunction with a Mission Street subway) and its Bernal Cut to avoid expensive tunneling through San Francisco's hills. Early plans for BART around 1960 considered several different routings for the Peninsula Line (then planned to extend to Palo Alto): the Bayshore Cutoff, the existing Twin Peaks Tunnel, a new bored tunnel crossing diagonally under the Mission District, and a Mission Street tunnel continuing via Alemany Boulevard. By 1961, the Mission Street tunnel and reuse of the Ocean View Branch was favored, with a station at Ocean Avenue. The plan was approved by voters in 1962.\n\nEarly BART plans referred to many stations by the cross street, but most stations were ultimately named for the surrounding neighborhood or city. The Ocean Avenue station was named Balboa Park after the nearby municipal park by 1967. The station was sandwiched between I-280 and Elkton shops, a sliver of which was taken for construction. Construction of the station was 60% complete by mid-1970, with work expected to be finished the next year. The San Francisco portion of BART, including Balboa Park station, opened on November 5, 1973.\n\nRather than having a single architecture firm design every station, BART had a number of architects (mostly local) design one or several stations each \"so that each station will achieve a character of its own, suitable to its own unique environment\". Balboa Park and Glen Park were designed by Ernest Born (who also designed the systemwide station signage) and Corlett & Spackman, with landscape work by Douglas Bayliss. Both stations were designed in the brutalist style, with Balboa Park the \"smaller and more intimate\". It has headhouses on each side of Geneva Avenue, sized to be appropriate to the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Original plans called for a bus parking deck over the platform, but a late decision to omit it (Woods Division in the Dogpatch neighborhood was built instead) allowed for the north and south ends of the platform to be in open air. The walls of the platform area are covered with linear precast concrete forms, with five patterns repeated eightfold to generate \"an apparently infinite variety\". Other elements praised by architectural critics included overhead power conduits on the platform level, and the interplay of light and shadow among the geometric forms of the mezzanine.\n\nAs Muni began transitioning from aging PCC streetcars to the Boeing USLRV in the 1970s, Elkton shops and the old car barn in Geneva Yard (which had been Muni's only rail yard since 1956) required modernization. Elkton Shops was closed on May 30, 1977, and replaced with a new facility. This Metro Rail Center included a loop track around its periphery, with an alighting area adjacent to the BART fare mezzanine in the southwest corner and a boarding area near San Jose Avenue in the southeast corner, plus a stop in the northeast corner of the yard. Some K Ingleside shuttle service was extended to Balboa Park on April 23, 1979, and all weekday service ran to Balboa Park after the line was converted to Muni Metro light rail operation on December 17, 1980. The Metro Rail Center was named the Curtis E. Green Light Rail Center in 1987. Green had become after Muni's general manager in 1974—the first African-American to lead a major transit system in the US—and retired in 1982. A second Muni Metro line, the M Ocean View, was extended to the station complex on August 30, 1980; it usually looped around Green Yard, but used the Geneva Yard loop at times. For some time beginning in 1982, the K and M lines were through-routed to avoid the yard loop. The Geneva Yard car barns were demolished in January 1983.\nIn 1972, Muni began planning a long-proposed extension of the J Church line along San Jose Avenue (a section of which was built along the former Ocean View Branch through the Bernal Cut) to Balboa Park. The extension was intended to provide transit service to the Outer Mission, allow J Church and N Judah trains to access the carhouses via San Jose Avenue rather than a roundabout route via the K Ingleside line, and allow future through-routing of the J and M lines. Construction on the extension began in January 1989, but was delayed by the earthquake later that year. On August 31, 1991, J and N streetcars began using the extension to access the yards, thus providing revenue J service to Balboa at limited hours. Full-time revenue service began June 19, 1993.\n\nThe extension included a new stop for the J line at San Jose and Ocean; inbound K trains also stopped at a plaza near that intersection. A small accessible platform was built east of Green Yard, next to the northbound track on San Jose at Seneca, to allow the planned through-routing. (Southbound trains were to use the existing alighting and boarding area on the Green Yard loop; a small accessible platform was available on the west side of the yard loop, north of the main alighting area.) However, although some weekday J and M service was through-routed from 1995 to 1998, full through-routing was never implemented. Instead, J trains shared the revenue loop around Green Yard with K trains, using the same boarding and alighting areas. J trains were diverted onto an inner track between the accessible platform and the boarding area; an underpass under the K track connected the J alighting area to the fare mezzanine. This allowed J and K trains to lay over separately so that irregular operations on one line would not impact the other.\n\nIn 2002, BART released the \"Comprehensive Station Plan\", which indicated a need for improved entrances and access at the station. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved the Balboa Park Area Plan in May 2009, setting the stage for a number of transit and pedestrian improvements to the station complex. Three projects—the Westside Walkway, the Eastside Connector, and new Muni boarding and alighting platforms—were prioritized and funded. As constructed, the BART station only had direct access from Geneva Avenue; a non-accessible pathway on the west side of the station was the only official route from Ocean Avenue, though many passengers took a shorter but dangerous route through the Muni yard instead. The Westside Walkway replaced the northern half of the path with a concrete ramp that leads to a new set of faregates at the north end of the headhouse, thus providing a shorter and fully accessible entrance from Ocean Avenue and the nearby City College of San Francisco (for which the station is the main transit access.) The walkway was opened on April 15, 2011.\n\nIn September 2014, Muni began construction of an accessible 1-car-length high-level platform on the east side of the yard, adjacent to San Jose Avenue, to allow level boarding for all inbound J and K riders. This platform replaced a narrow, non-accessible boarding area on the south end of the yard loop. The J and K lines were rerouted onto San Jose Avenue during construction. The new platform was opened on April 27, 2015, with both lines immediately rerouted back to the loop around the yard. The K stop at the northeast corner of the yard was permanently closed on April 25. Red-painted bus lanes were added on westbound Geneva Avenue between Delano Avenue and I-280 in March 2016.\n\nOn May 31, 2016, BART began construction of the Eastside Connector project, a northward expansion of the headhouse over the open BART platform with improved connections between Muni and BART. In September 2016, Muni began construction of its section of the project—a longer high-level deboarding platform to replace the mini-high platform on the west side of the yard. This work was coordinated with rail replacement in the yard and widening the pedestrian walkway to San Jose Avenue. The J Church line was rerouted onto San Jose Avenue, while the K Ingleside was cut back to City College Pedestrian Bridge. The K was returned to the loop on May 20, 2017, while the J remained on San Jose Avenue until November 18. The steel deck beams were lifted into place on July 16, 2017. The renovations were completed with the opening of the Eastside Connector on November 30, 2018.\n\nThe opening of the Muni Metro East facility on the T Third Street line in 2008 reduced storage needs at Geneva Yard. The Upper Yard was closed, and the main yard increasingly dedicated to Muni's historic streetcar fleet. On December 2, 2010, Muni and the Market Street Railway nonprofit organization opened a 6-track shelter at the yard to house 24 historic streetcars. The $10.1 million structure forms the primary storage and maintenance area for the historic fleet. On October 25, 2011, the yard was renamed Cameron Beach Yard after a recently deceased member of the SFMTA Board of Directors. From June 21, 2014 to June 16, 2018, the historic streetcar fleet was stored at Muni Metro East rather than Cameron Beach Yard, as the latter was needed for LRVs displaced by Green Yard rail replacement work.\n\nIn 2012, Muni released the \"Balboa Park Station Capacity and Conceptual Engineering Study\", which analyzed a number of possible improvements to the station area to guide future project choices. Projects recommended by the report (along with those discussed above) included:\n\nThe 2011 plan for a rerouting of the M Ocean View through Parkmerced assumed that the M would continue to terminate at Balboa Park. Initial plans in 2014 for a 19th Avenue subway had the M divide into two branches, one terminating at Parkmerced and the other at Balboa Park. A 2016 update to the plan called for the J Church to continue on San Jose Avenue at Balboa Park and take over existing M service as far as San Francisco State University station.\n\nIn March 2018, BART released preliminary plans for the next round of modifications to the station. The project would include modern headhouses on both sides of Geneva Avenue, an elevator connecting the south side of Geneva Avenue to the pedestrian underpass and the platform, an elevator connecting the north side of Geneva Avenue to the Muni platform level and fare mezzanine, platform canopies and seating, and new interior finishes and public art.\n\nThe office building at Geneva Yard was designated a San Francisco Landmark by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1985. After being damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the office building and powerhouse were red-tagged and abandoned. In 1998, Muni planned to demolish the structures to create a parking lot; the agency dropped the plans the next year due to community opposition and the intervention of mayor Willie Brown. The nonprofit group Friends of the Geneva Office Building (later Friends of the Geneva Car Barn and Powerhouse) was formed with the intention of instead renovating the buildings for community use.\n\nMuni completed initial stabilization of the structures in 1999. In March 2004, control of the buildings was transferred to the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department. Over the next 11 years, the Department and the Friends spent $3.98 million on repairs, design, and other work related to the buildings. Additional stabilization and seismic refit of the structures was begun in 2004 and completed in 2006. The buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 31, 2010 as Geneva Office Building and Power House.\n\nThe city gave the Friends of the Geneva Car Barn control of the building in 2014, but reclaimed it in 2015 when the group had difficulties raising funds. In June 2017, the Department budgeted $3 million from a 2012 parks bond, bringing available funding to $11 million. The next month, the city announced that it would receive $3.5 million in state funds for the project—enough to complete renovations of the powerhouse. The city accepted the grant in December. A groundbreaking ceremony for the $14 million powerhouse renovation was held in March 2018. The car barn restoration is estimated to cost $38.5 million; the city intends to begin in 2020, but funding has not been obtained.\n\n"}
{"id": "2146439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146439", "title": "Terrax", "text": "Terrax\n\nTerrax the Tamer is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nThe character first appears in \"Fantastic Four\" #211 (Oct. 1979) and was created by Marv Wolfman and John Byrne.\n\nThe character first appears as a Birjan named Tyros, the ruler of the city-state of Lanlak on the planetoid Birj. The cosmic entity Galactus selects Tyros as his next Herald, but first wishes for the superhero team the Fantastic Four to humble him. In return the cosmic entity agrees to travel to Earth to aid the heroes against a new threat, the villain Sphinx. Tyros is defeated, and brought before Galactus, who changes the petty tyrant into \"Terrax the Tamer\". His minor control over stone was augmented to an incalculable degree. Now, he could affect all matter of rock and stone on nearly a planetary scale. His body was changed so that it would withstand the vacuum of space. Finally, Galactus gave Terrax a weapon called the cosmic axe capable of generating waves of cosmic force. Terrax travels with Galactus to Earth, and while his new master battles the Sphinx, attacks the Fantastic Four—still resenting the heroes for their role in his transformation. Terrax, however, is tricked and defeated by the Human Torch, and leaves with a victorious Galactus.\n\nAs Galactus's new herald, Terrax found more worlds for his master than any of the previous heralds. Terrax likened the discovery of new planets to the feeling of conquest. On several occasions, Terrax annihilated large segments of the population himself using his cosmic powers. As Galactus had hoped, Terrax's lack of morality made him a successful herald. But whereas Galactus's other heralds had a sense of loyalty to their master, Terrax had none. Indeed, he served Galactus out of fear for his master's power, but even conquered that fear on several occasions to defy Galactus' wishes. Shortly after being transformed into Galactus' herald, Terrax fled from his master and overthrew the ruling body of a small-unnamed planet. He enslaved the entire population and set himself up as the planet's deity. Huge segments of that world's people died erecting temples and cities to glorify Terrax. Terrax planned to use the survivors of his reign as the first wave of a planned universe conquering army. But before Terrax could proceed any further, Galactus summoned his herald. Fearful of his master's wrath, Terrax hid in a black hole. Utilizing the powers of the Earth mutant Dazzler, Galactus freed Terrax and made him obedient to his will again.\n\nTerrax reappears in the title \"Rom\", and after leading Galactus to the planet Galador, battles its champion, Rom, and his fellow Spaceknight, Terminator.\n\nBut Terrax's rebellious nature could not be totally stifled, and after a while, Terrax again fled his master. This time, he went to Earth. Utilizing his power, Terrax levitated the entire island of Manhattan into earth orbit and used the lives of its millions of inhabitants to bargain with the Fantastic Four. To spare Manhattan, Terrax demanded that they destroy Galactus by attacking his ship. Galactus had by now realized that his herald had become a liability to him, Returning Manhattan to Earth, Galactus stripped Terrax of his cosmic power and the transformed alien was sent hurtling from the top of the World Trade Center down to the street below. Although seriously injured, Terrax's alien physique enabled him to survive the fall. An unidentified passerby took Terrax's broken form, unknown to both the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, who were present at the site, to a nearby hospital. He remained there for several months in a semi comatose state.\n\nVictor Von Doom, looking for a pawn to use in a plot against the Fantastic Four, discovered that Terrax had survived. Terrax was kidnapped from the hospital and brought back to Doom's kingdom of Latveria by a squad of robots dispatched by Doom. There, after six weeks of Doom's advanced treatments, Terrax recovered. But, having been stripped of cosmic power, Terrax had no memories of having been the herald of Galactus, and thus called himself Tyros once more. Doom had recently perfected a device that was capable of endowing an individual with limited cosmic power. Tyros readily agreed to be exposed to the device's energies, as he wished revenge against the Fantastic Four. Garbed in a special suit that would channel and regulate the cosmic energies in his body, Tyros set off for New York. Unknown to him, the power Doom gave him would consume Tyros's body within a matter of hours. Thus, Doom would not be faced with an adversary whose power was vaster than his own, once Tyros had served his purpose.\n\nTyros defeated the Fantastic Four at a shopping mall and, detesting the fact he was in the service of any master, he turned on Doom and immobilized the Latverian monarch in his armor. At Tyros's moment of seeming triumph, the Silver Surfer, the first of Galactus's heralds, arrived to save the lives of his friends. Tyros believed that his power level was equal to that of the Surfer's, but he soon learned that he was no match for someone who had received the Power Cosmic from Galactus himself. Tyros was forced to use his powers to their limit in order to combat the Surfer. This only served to hasten his inevitable deterioration. As the two former heralds of Galactus engaged in battle, Tyros was totally consumed by the Power Cosmic. When Tyros and Silver Surfer crash to the ground, they land on and obliterate the helpless Doctor Doom. Suddenly a shopper speaks arrogantly to an elderly woman, who turns out to be Spider-Man's Aunt May. Doctor Doom had, unknown to anybody, transferred his mind into the body of a shopper while leaving the shopper to die in Doctor Doom's body. It is left to the Beyonder to undo this confusing chain of events.\n\nIn an \"Avengers\" annual Terrax is temporarily resurrected to become a member of the second Legion of the Unliving by the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster.\n\nTyros reforms his physical form as Terrax in the title \"New Warriors\", and battles the fledgling superhero team. Terrax is defeated when the heroes, deducing that his form is unstable and that constant contact with earth is required, separate him and thereby his form. Terrax reappears when reformed once again by a rogue scientist attempting to steal his power. He uses the scientist as a host body and again battles the New Warriors and Fantastic Four. The Silver Surfer intervenes and maroons Terrax on the deserted planet Pluraris IV.\n\nTerrax features in the third volume of the \"Silver Surfer\" when asked to join his fellow Heralds against the threat of Galactus' latest Herald, Morg. After Morg's defeat, Terrax claims the character's axe. Morg eventually wishes to retrieve his weapon and battles Terrax until both are briefly captured—together with several other extraterrestrial characters Gladiator and Beta Ray Bill—by the entity Tyrant. Terrax guest stars in the limited series \"Cosmic Powers\", in which Tyrant is confronted and thwarted by the Titan Thanos.\n\nAfter a battle with fellow Heralds the Surfer and Nova (actually the demon Mephisto in disguise) in the title \"Silver Surfer\", the character goes into hiding until he featured in the second \"Sentry\" limited series. During the \"GLX-Mas Special\", Terrax is confronted and defeated by Squirrel Girl. Terrax appears in the \"Annihilation\" storyline, being initially captured by the forces of Annihilus before escaping with the Alien Skrull Paibok. Terrax later finds a world ruled by the Space Parasite, whom he eventually kills. On discovering that the inhabitants are content to live in subservience, he flies into a rage and destroys the planet.\n\nIn the title \"Hulk\", Terrax is plucked from continuity by the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster to be part of a team called the Offenders in a bid to thwart the Hulk.\n\nTerrax later returns to his birth planet Birj where he's approached by one member of the Nova Corps, who had come to give a warning to Terrax and is helping in the evacuation of the planet. Terrax briefly fights him and refuses to evacuate the planet. Nova runs away as the threat he warned Terrax about arrives. As Nova leaves the planet, he sees the Phoenix Force completely consuming the planet Birj on its way through the universe, taking Terrax and all its population with it.\n\nWhile he was killed by the Phoenix Force, Tyros was eventually resurrected at some point and was found by Drax the Destroyer when the later crash landed on an unnamed planet. The events that led to his resurrection are unknown even for Tyros, but he suspects that the Phoenix's energy that killed him also might have restored him back to life. He later acquired a Phoenix Egg, under unknown circumstances, and stored it on his warship. Thane eventually learned about this, and deceived his allies (the Champion, Starfox and Nebula) into helping him invade Terrax's warship to steal the egg.\n\nTerrax later lands in San Francisco, California, where he battles the Superior Spider-Man. During the battle, Terrax nearly kills Superior Spider-Man, until the Night Shift shows up and drops a device which Spider-Man uses to absorb some of his cosmic powers. Despite being slightly depowered, Terrax still proves to be a match for Spider-Man but is eventually defeated.\n\nTyros is an alien with a genetic mutation that gives him a limited mental ability to manipulate the molecules of rock and earth. After being transformed by the Power Cosmic of Galactus, the character can perform feats as fine as manipulating sand and as grand as causing volcanic eruptions and moving asteroids, meteors, and planetary masses from space at high speeds; shift tectonic plates to cause earthquakes and create chasms; and levitate large land masses miles into the air. Like all Heralds, Terrax possesses superhuman strength, stamina, reflexes and durability; energy projection; force fields; warp speed and is immune to the rigors of space. The character further possesses a cosmic scythe which he sometimes directs his energy attacks through.\n\nA future version of Terrax appears in alternate universe the MC2 title, \"Fantastic Five\".\n\nIn \"Earth-TRN267,\" Terrax was also a herald of Galaktus and called himself \"Terrax the Truly Enlightened\". When this Earth started to collide with Earth-616 due to an Incursion, the Illuminati traveled to that reality to see if they could save the people there before destroying the world. They found that Terrax had already guided Galaktus of that universe to destroy it in order to save his universe. Terrax demanded the Illuminati retreat to their home reality, but they refused, and Terrax attacked them. Terrax was eventually defeated and captured but not in time to stop Galactus, who consumed the Earth-TRN267, averting in the process the Earth-616's destruction.\n\nTerrax was taken to Earth-616 and was imprisoned in the Necropolis of Wakanda in a cell next to Black Swan's, where she later suggested that he would soon have an interest in teaming up with her. Terrax joins the New Cabal to destroy Earths that are colliding with Earth-616.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2146445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146445", "title": "Jet Moto 2", "text": "Jet Moto 2\n\nJet Moto 2 (known as Jet Rider 2 in Europe and Jet Moto '98 in Japan) is a 1997 racing video game developed by SingleTrac and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation video game console. It is the sequel to the 1996 game \"Jet Moto\". It was released in North America on October 31, 1997, in Europe in April 1998, and in Japan on August 6, 1998. In January 2008 \"Jet Moto 2\" was made available for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network. The PlayStation Greatest Hits version, branded within the game as Jet Moto 2: Championship Edition, is slightly different from the original in that the framerate is increased, the number of competitors is limited to four, and all the original \"Jet Moto\" tracks are unlocked from the start.\n\nAs with \"Jet Moto\", gameplay in \"Jet Moto 2\" revolves around the use of hoverbikes to traverse a race course, similar to modern day motorcross, but with the added ability to traverse water. Reviews for \"Jet Moto 2\" were mixed. Reviewers felt the game was an improvement over the original, but again criticized its high difficulty. \"Jet Moto 2\"s popularity would spawn one additional sequel, \"Jet Moto 3\".\n\n\"Jet Moto 2\" retains all of the basic gameplay from its predecessor. Players control hoverbikes which sit close to the ground and can be ridden over land and water. The courses in the game are designed to take advantage of this ability. Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and JetSki, similar to real-life sponsored racing. The riders received an overhaul, with only a total of ten selectable characters being available, and subsequently only ten racers on the track at any given time.\n\nThe number of tracks available greatly increased, with ten new tracks added plus the ability to unlock all of the tracks from the original game. Track designs are more varied in \"Jet Moto 2\", with each level containing a unique theme rather than the shared themes of the original. The courses range from earthquake-damaged cities, to desert canyons, ice-covered mountains, a roller coaster, and several other themes.\n\nThe difficulty was also increased in \"Jet Moto 2\". In order to conserve CPU cycles for other things the developers used gameplay recordings in place of fully developed racer AI. As a result, most AI racers have a perfect run and any mistakes made by the player result in a quick loss of top racing positions. The PlayStation Greatest Hits version of the game, dubbed \"Jet Moto 2: Championship Edition\" further changed the gameplay mechanics. All \"Jet Moto\" tracks were immediately unlocked for the player. Additionally, the number of in-game racers would be reduced from ten to only four to allow the game to run at 30 frames per second.\n\n\"Jet Moto 2\"s original cut from 20 competitors to 10 was \"to open the game up to a broader market, one that wasn’t driven by hardcore.\" Chef Boyardee was one of the new sponsors in the game, however the game's producer, Brian Wiklem fought to ensure the sponsor would not be a rider's sponsor. As a result, Chef Boyardee's logo was added to track advertisements throughout the tracks. Of the ten new tracks created for the game, five concepts were designed by SingleTrac, and five by Wiklem and his assistant. Dual Analog Controllers and the accompanying vibration functions were supported for the first time, but DualShock Controllers were not. As with the first \"Jet Moto\", Axiom Design created the user interface shell for the game. Pinnacle Music Group composed the music for the game. \"Jet Moto 2\" would receive localized renames in Europe and Japan. Its European title is \"Jet Rider 2\", and its Japanese title is \"Jet Moto '98\".\n\nThe Greatest Hits version of the game was never meant to be released in its current form. As the game's production cycle was ending, Wiklem asked SingleTrac to modify the game for him a modified version of \"Jet Moto 2\". This version increased the framerate to 30 frames per second by removing six competitors from races, thus putting less strain on the PlayStation hardware. Additionally, Wiklem requested that all of the original \"Jet Moto\" tracks be unlocked at the start of the game. It was branded in-game as \"Jet Moto 2: Championship Edition\".\n\nDue to their master disc being destroyed, Sony contacted Wiklem for a copy to use as a master disc for burning. Wiklem sent the altered disc SingleTrac had made for him, notifying Sony of the change and petitioning it be used as the Greatest Hits version. Sony replied that Greatest Hits titles must be the same as the original release version. Dismayed, Wiklem burned a copy of the original version and sent it to Sony for duplication. Due to a mixup in the duplication process, the modified version of the game was duplicated and not the original version. Sony Digital Audio Disc Corporation contacted Sony Computer Entertainment about the mix up, and eventually the discussions trickled down to Wiklem himself. He told vice president of marketing Jeff Fox that he \"did send the right disc, it was properly labeled, and it’s not my fault that DADC couldn’t read.\" The situation was put to rest shortly thereafter, with the decision being made not to make any further changes to the Greatest Hits disc.\n\n\"Jet Moto 2\" received mixed reviews from critics. It held a 70.08% at GameRankings, a video game aggregator, based on 12 reviews. Like \"Jet Moto\", the games popularity would earn it a spot in the PlayStation Greatest Hits. Between the original version and the Greatest Hits \"Championship Edition\", \"Jet Moto 2\" sold over 800,000 copies.\n\nReviewers generally praised the new variety of tracks offered, and the fact that the original \"Jet Moto\" tracks could be unlocked. GameSpot stated that the variety of courses \"take the Jet Moto series yet another step away from the traditional racer.\" Reviewers also noted improved graphics over the original, citing that the game seems to have a less polygonal look. The improvements to the physics system were especially praised by IGN, calling them \"even more over-the-top\" and that the game was \"simply more playable\". GameSpot felt oppositely, stating that the physics seemed to have degenerated from the original game. They noted that often a rider will fly off in an odd direction when thrown from the bike.\n\nAs with the original reviewers felt that, though the gameplay had improved, it was still too difficult. IGN noted that the product placement seemed excessive, and felt the game was not unique enough from the original in the end, calling it \"\"Jet Moto 1.5\"\".\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Had Singletrac succeeded in making \"Jet Moto 2\" a brand new game with a look to reflect the year between titles, it would've deserved a higher score. As it is, it's just more of the same, with less innovation.\"\n\n\"Jet Moto 2\" was the last game developed by SingleTrac for publisher Sony Computer Entertainment. Pacific Coast Power & Light developed \"Jet Moto 3\", with 989 Sports publishing the third title. \"Jet Moto 3\" was released August 31, 1999 exclusively in North America. To date it is the last title in the series to be released. Two other titles were cancelled during their development. Pacific Coast Power & Light was also developing \"Jet Moto 2124\" for the PlayStation, set over a century after the first three games, however the game was cancelled when \"Jet Moto 3\" showed poor sales. \"\", developed by RedZone Interactive, was also cancelled. \"SOLAR\" would have been the first title in the series to appear on the PlayStation 2.\n"}
{"id": "2146446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146446", "title": "Antonio José Martínez Palacios", "text": "Antonio José Martínez Palacios\n\nAntonio José Martínez Palacios (12 December 190211 October 1936), professionally known as Antonio José, was a Spanish composer. Maurice Ravel apparently said of Antonio José: \"He will become \"the\" Spanish composer of our century\", however, his music lay forgotten until the 1980s.\n\nBorn in Burgos, Antonio José became a music teacher at a Jesuit school and conducted the city choir in Burgos. The sheer volume of his work (he died at 33) was prodigious. He penned his first composition when he was 14. He was hired as a director of a musical review in Burgos at the age of 18. He wrote extensively for voice in his quest to present the melodies of his native Burgos to the world. His compositions, especially the \"Sinfonía castellana\" and \"Suite Ingenua\", put his orchestration on a par with anything at the time in the twentieth century. His most famous work is a sonata for guitar.\n\nHis harmonic understanding put him in the forefront of post-impressionist composers, and though a disciple of Ravel, his particular voice and choice of medium set him distinctly apart. His chief biographer, Miguel Ángel Palacios Garoz, points out that Antonio José was not only a prolific composer but a writer with an intellectually facile mind that was open to influences from all fronts of contemporary music.\n\nHe met the same fate as Federico García Lorca: he was executed by a Falangist firing squad in 1936 at Estépar (Burgos).\n\n"}
