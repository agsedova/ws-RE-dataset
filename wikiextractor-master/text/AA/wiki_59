{"id": "1862200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862200", "title": "Islamic pottery", "text": "Islamic pottery\n\nMedieval Islamic pottery occupied a geographical position between Chinese ceramics, then the unchallenged leaders of Eurasian production, and the pottery of the Byzantine Empire and Europe. For most of the period it can fairly be said to have been between the two in terms of aesthetic achievement and influence as well, borrowing from China and exporting to and influencing Byzantium and Europe. The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the Hadiths, with the result that pottery and glass were used for tableware by Muslim elites, as pottery (but less often glass) also was in China, but was much rarer in Europe and Byzantium. In the same way Islamic restrictions greatly discouraged figurative wall-painting, encouraging the architectural use of schemes of decorative and often geometrically-patterned tiles, which are the most distinctive and original speciality of Islamic ceramics.\n\nThe era of Islamic pottery started around 622. From 633, Muslim armies moved rapidly towards Persia, Byzantium, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Egypt and later Andalusia. The early history of Islamic pottery remains somewhat obscure and speculative as little evidence has survived. Apart from tiles which escaped destruction due to their use in architectural decoration of buildings and mosques, much early medieval pottery vanished.\n\nThe Muslim world inherited significant pottery industries in Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, North Africa (African Red Slip) and later other regions. Indeed, the origin of glazed pottery has been traced to Egypt where it was first introduced during the fourth millennium BCE. However most of these traditions made heavy use of figurative decoration, which was greatly reduced, though not entirely removed, under Islam. Instead Islamic pottery developed geometric and plant-based decoration to a very high level, and made more use of decorative schemes made up of many tiles than any previous culture.\n\nA distinct Muslim style in pottery was not firmly established until the 9th century in Iraq (formerly Mesopotamia), Syria and Persia. During this period pieces mainly used white tin-glaze. Information on earlier periods is very limited. This is largely due to the lack of surviving specimens in good condition which also limits the interest in the study of ceramics of these periods. Archaeological excavations carried out in Jordan uncovered only a few examples from the Umayyad period, mostly unglazed vessels from Khirbat Al-Mafjar. In the East, evidence shows that a production centre was set up in Samarkand under the Samanid dynasty who ruled this region and parts of Persia between 874 and 999 A.D. The most highly regarded technique of this centre is the use of calligraphy in the decoration of vessels. East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called \"epigraphic ware\", has been described as \"probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery\".\n\nDuring the Abbasid dynasty pottery production gained momentum, largely using tin glazes mostly in the form of opaque white glaze. Some historians, such as Arthur Lane, attribute the rise of such industry to Chinese influence. Evidence from Muslim manuscripts, such as Akhbar al-Sin wa al-Hind (circa 851) and Ibn Kurdadhbih's Book of Roads and Provinces (846-885), suggest that trade with China was firmly established. Lane also referred to the passage in a work written by Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Baihaki, (circa 1059) where he stated that the governor of Khurasan, ‘Ali ibn ‘Isa, sent as a present to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786-809), “twenty pieces of Chinese Imperial porcelain (Chini faghfuri), the like of which had never been seen at a Caliph’s court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain”.\nAccording to Lane, the influence of Chinese pottery progressed in three main phases. The first contact with China took place in 751 when the Arabs defeated the Chinese at the Battle of Talas. It has been argued that imprisoned Chinese potters and paper makers could have taught the Muslims the art of pottery and paper-making. In 800's Chinese stoneware and porcelain reached the Abbasids. The second phase took place in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a period noted for the decline of pottery industry following the fall of the Seljuk dynasty. This period also saw the invasion of the Mongols who brought Chinese pottery traditions.\n\nThe influence of ceramics from the Tang Dynasty can be seen on lustrewares, produced by Mesopotamian potters, and on some early white wares excavated at Samarra (in modern-day Iraq). Ceramics from this period were excavated at Nishapur (in modern-day Iran) and Samarkand (in modern-day Uzbekistan).\nBy the time of the Mongol invasion of China a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own fritware bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of Korean pottery, but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports. Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger celadon dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East. Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking.\n\nThe Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of Chinese blue and white porcelain, which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming. Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the arabesques and plant scrolls of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels. This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves. The cobalt blue that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in Quanzhou, convenient for the huge Jingdezhen potteries, and other ports to the south.\n\nThe start of the Ming dynasty was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries. This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).\n\nOften Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming. In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the Zhengde Emperor's (r. 1505-1521) flirtation with Islam.\n\nFrom between the eighth and eighteenth centuries, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate pottery. Tin-opacified glazing, for the production of tin-glazed pottery, was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of stoneware originating in 9th-century Iraq. It was a vitreous or semivitreous ceramic ware of fine texture, made primarily from non-refactory fire clay. Other centres for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included Fustat (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and Tabriz (from 1470 to 1550).\n\nLusterware was produced in Mesopotamia in the 9th century; the technique soon became popular in Persia and Syria. Lusterware was later produced in Egypt during the Fatimid caliphate in the 10th-12th centuries. While some production of lustreware continued in the Middle East, it spread to Europe—first in the Hispano-Moresque ware of Al-Andalus, notably at Málaga, and then Valencia, then later to Italy, where it was used to enhance maiolica.\n\nAnother innovation was the albarello, a type of maiolica earthenware jar originally designed to hold apothecaries' ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of pharmacy jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. Brought to Italy from Spain, the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century.\n\nFritware refers to a type of pottery which was first developed in the Near East, where production is dated to the late first millennium AD through the second millennium AD. Frit was a significant ingredient. A recipe for “fritware” dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu’l Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to “frit-glass” to white clay is 10:1:1. This type of pottery has also been referred to as “stoneware\" and “faience” among other names. A ninth-century corpus of “proto-stoneware” from Baghdad has “relict glass fragments” in its fabric. The glass is alkali-lime-lead-silica and, when the paste was fired or cooled, wollastonite and diopside crystals formed within the glass fragments. The lack of “inclusions of crushed pottery” suggests these fragments did not come from a glaze. The reason for their addition would be to act as a flux, and so “accelerate vitrification at a relatively low firing temperature, and thus increase the hardness and density of the [ceramic] body.”\n\nBy this period the distinctive Islamic tradition of decorated wall tiles had emerged, and continued to develop together with vessel pottery in a way unique to Islamic art. In the account of Ibn Naji (circa 1016) the Caliph sent, in addition to tiles, “a man from Baghdad” to Qairawan to produce lustre tiles for the mihrab of the Great Mosque (still well preserved). Georges Marcais suggested that Iraqi potters indeed came to Quairawan. The arrival of this Baghdadi potter must have led to the establishment of a satellite centre for the production of ceramics in Quairawan, but no information has yet been developed to confirm or deny this suggestion.\n\nThe events leading to the collapse of the Fatimid reign in 1171 caused ceramic production to move out to new centres, via processes similar to those described above with respect to Iraq. As a result, Persia became a centre of revival under the Seljuk rule (1038–1327). This is not coincidental as the Seljuks expanded their rule over Persia, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine, as well as Anatolia and Muslim Asia Minor. All of these had been, for some considerable time, centres of old pottery.\n\nThe Seljuks brought new and fresh inspiration to the Muslim world, attracting artists, craftsmen and potters from all regions including Egypt. In addition to continuing the production of similar (although more refined) tin and lustre glaze ceramics, the Seljuks (in Persia) were credited for the introduction of a new type sometimes known as \"Faience\". This is made from a hard white frit paste coated with transparent alkaline glaze.\n\nHispano-Moresque ware emerged in Al-Andaluz in the 13th century, probably after potters escaped the instability after the fall of the Fatimids. It introduced lustreware manufacture to Europe and from the start was widely exported to the elites of Christian kingdoms. The first centre was Málaga, producing wares in traditional Islamic styles, but from the 13th century Muslim potters migrated to the reconquered Christian city of Valencia, outlying suburbs of which such as Manises and Paterna became the most important centres, manufacturing mainly for Christian markets in styles increasingly influenced by European decoration, though retaining a distinct character. The potters were mostly still Muslim or Morisco.\nIn a rare manuscript from Kashan compiled by Abulqassim in 1301, there is a complete description of how faience production was carried out. Frit was made of ten parts of powdered quartz, one part of clay and one part of glaze mixture. The addition of greater amounts of clay made wheel throwing of the faience easier, and allowed a better quality of work, because otherwise the material had little plasticity. The glaze itself is “formed of a roughly equal mixture of ground quartz and the ashes of desert plants which contain a very high proportion of alkaline salts. These act as a flux and cause the quartz to vitrify at a manageable temperature. The two alone will produce a transparent glaze”. Lane compared this material with the French pâte tender, which was used by potters as recently as the eighteenth century. This body material and the new glaze offered the potter a greater handling and manipulation ability. This allows the potter to improve the quality and appearance of the vessel, including more refined decorative designs and patterns. The result was a substantial variety of products such as bowls of different size and shapes, jugs, incense burners, lamps, candlesticks, trays, tiles and so on. These advantages also allowed greater control of carved decoration, the use of which the Seljuks refined and extended during the twelfth century.\n\nCarved decoration in ceramics, sgraffito, is an old tradition used in ninth-century Islamic pottery; it is an engraving technique based on incising the design with a sharp tool through a white slip to reveal the red earthenware body. The vessel is then coated with glaze.\n\nThe Seljuks also developed the so-called silhouette wares which are distinguished by their black background. These are produced by a technique which consists of coating the white fritware body with a thick black slip, out of which the decoration is then carved. Later, a coat of colourless or coloured, usually blue or green, transparent glaze is applied. According to Lane, this technique was used, in a simpler form, in Samarkand between the ninth and tenth centuries. The method then consisted of mixing the colours with a thick opaque clay slip instead.\n\nThe influence of Blue and white porcelain of the Yuan and Ming dynasties is evident in many ceramics made by Muslim potters. İznik pottery from around İznik in Anatolia was supported by the Ottoman court and produced the finest Ottoman work in pottery and panels of tiles, using the same vocabulary of bold and elegant floral designs derived from Chinese decoration. A characteristic bold red was developed. İznik ware had a major influence on European decorative arts: for example, on Italian Maiolica. The pottery was produced in as early as the 15th century AD, and was preceded by Miletus ware from the same region. Its best period lasted until the late 16th century. It consists of a body, slip, and glaze, where the body and glaze are “quartz-frit.” The “frits” in both cases “are unusual in that they contain lead oxide as well as soda”; the lead oxide would help reduce the thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic. Microscopic analysis reveals that the material that has been labeled “frit” is “interstitial glass” which serves to connect the quartz particles. Michael S. Tite argues that this glass was added as frit and that the interstitial glass formed on firing.\n\nThe 15th century saw the finest period of the Hispano-Moresque ware of Valencia, produced by largely Muslim potters in a Christian kingdom, though the southern industry centred on Málaga had ended by the mid-century. Persian pottery under the Safavid dynasty (from 1502) was also heavily influenced by Chinese blue and white porcelain, which to a large extent replaced it in court circles; fine 16th-century Persian pieces are very rare. \n\nThe Islamic parts of Southeast Asia, modern Indonesia and Malaysia, were export markets that were close at hand for the Chinese and later the Japanese, helped by the European trading companies, especially the Dutch East India Company. The Buddhist countries of the region also exported. Special types of wares were developed for them, such as the Chinese Kraak ware and Swatow ware, mostly producing large dishes for serving communally to a table. In the face of such competition, local wares were few and simple. \n\nThe Islamic world as a whole never managed to develop porcelain, but had an avid appetite for imports of it. East Asian porcelain, first Chinese then Japanese export porcelain in the 17th century, was joined in the 18th century by the wares from Europe, in particular Vienna porcelain, which specialized in the Eastern market, and by the latter part of the century was sending as many as 120,000 pieces per year to the Ottoman Empire, many small cups and saucers for Turkish coffee. The smaller scale factories of the Islamic world could not compete with the sophisticated imports arriving from both east and west, and local production became a craft affair, repeating now-traditional patterns.\n\nArthur Lane produced two books which made substantial contribution to understanding the history and merit of Muslim ceramics. The first book was dedicated to the study of early ceramics from the Abbasid period till the Seljuk times, sketching the various events which played a significant role in the rise and fall of particular styles. In his second work, Lane used the same rhetorical style adopted in the first book, this time devoting his attention to later periods from the Mongols to nineteenth-century İznik and Persian pottery.\n\nFollowing Lane's works, numerous studies appeared. The most comprehensive works adopting a general view are those by R.L. Hobson, Ernst J. Grube, Richard Ettinghausen, and more recently Alan Caiger-Smith and Gesa Febervari. Additional contributions were made by those specializing in particular temporal or regional history of Muslim pottery such as Georges Marcais in his work on North Africa, Oliver Watson on Persia and J.R. Hallett on Abbasid Pottery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Aw was named as one of the Seven Princesses of Mediacorp in 2006, after which she achieved wider success with her leading role in acclaimed drama \"The Little Nyonya\". She was prominently a full-time Mediacorp artiste from 2002 to 2017 but continues to film on an ad-hoc basis and was once managed under Hype Records. Through her television career, Aw has established herself as one of the most popular and high-profile celebrities in Singapore. She has won 29 awards, the record number for a performer, at Mediacorp's Star Awards. Aw has published two books – the best-selling \"Jeanette Aw: Definitions\" in 2012 and \"Sol's World: Somebody to Love\" in 2015 – and starred in musical \"Beauty World\" in 2015.\n\nWhile in college, Aw entered \"Route to Glamour\", in which she placed first. She signed on with SPH Mediaworks and made her acting debut in the 2001 drama \"Touched\". Aw then switched to Mediacorp in 2002 and played Mo Jingjing in \"Holland V\" (2003). Aw garnered critical appreciation for portraying flawed actress, Zhao Fei Er, in \"The Dream Makers\" (2013) and its 2015 sequel. She won her first Best Actress award at the Star Awards for her performance in the latter drama.\n\nAw's off-screen roles include duties as a brand ambassador for several Singapore and international companies and PR ambassador for the Japanese city of Takasaki.\n\nAw was born in Singapore as a Hokkien with ancestry from Quanzhou city, Southern Fujian, China. She has an elder sister and an elder brother. Coming from an English-speaking family, Aw rarely used Mandarin in their conversations. She considered her childhood blessed and fortunate because her parents provided for everything that she needed. Growing up with a carefree nature, she was an introvert and was \"the kind of girl who loved reading, writing and drawing\". Aw wanted to be a dancer, an artist or a child psychologist.\n\nAttending Raffles Girls' Primary School, Crescent Girls' School, National Junior College and National University of Singapore, Aw was a school prefect and a model student. Her best subjects were English Literature and English, and she scored an A for art at the O Levels. Aw did gymnastics in primary school, dance in secondary school and swimming in junior college. She started ballet training at 13, and Aw went on to dance almost everyday before signing her first acting contract. She also played the saxophone in her secondary school concert band and trained for a girl group in junior college. In university, Aw was President of the NUS Dance Ensemble. Though she considered majoring in child psychology because of her love for children, Aw planned to pursue a career on stage and eventually graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Degree in Theatre Studies.\n\nWhile preparing for her graduation production in her final year at university (before receiving an offer for the Honours Degree program), Aw and her friends also auditioned at theater companies. A friend told her that a company was looking for actors, and Aw only learnt that it was a television station after submitting her application. Joining \"Route to Glamour\", a talent search organised in Singapore and Malaysia by the now defunct television network SPH MediaWorks in 2000, Aw beat over 5000 applicants to emerge champion and signed on with the network. In her debut year, she was awarded \"Best Performer\" and \"Best Newcomer\" and co-starred in a Taiwanese television drama. Aw left SPH MediaWorks in early 2002 to complete her studies, joined Hype Records and then officially signed on as a Mediacorp artiste in May 2002. She starred as Fan Keke in \"Beautiful Connection\", the highest-rated Singapore drama in 2002, and won the Best Newcomer award at Star Awards 2002. Aw also filmed the Taiwanese idol drama \"Kiss of a Toast II\".\n\nIn 2003, Aw acted in \"True Heroes\", before going on to star as Mo Jingjing, a young woman with low IQ, in \"Holland V\". It was the most watched Singapore drama that year, and she grew popular for playing the character. Aw was nominated for Best Actress at Star Awards 2003, but lost to co-star Chen Liping. However, she won her first \"Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes\" award. After the mega success of \"Holland V\", Aw was seen as a possible successor of the \"Ah Jie\" (big sister) status. In 2004, Aw starred in her first female lead role as Wen Qian in \"Spice Siblings\" alongside Tay Ping Hui and Cynthia Koh. Following that, she starred in two dramas – \"A Child's Hope II\" and \"The Champion\". Aw was again nominated for Best Actress for her excellent performance in \"A Child's Hope II\" and also won the \"Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes\" award at Star Awards 2004.\n\nFollowing two years of non-stop filming, Aw became less productive in 2005. In January, she starred as Fang Lixiang in \"My Lucky Charm\" alongside Huang Biren. That year, Aw filmed one drama, \"The Rainbow Connection\", where she played Ding Yingying, a talented dancer who has stage fright. This drama involved an ensemble cast drawing from Singapore, mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia. As Aw was also a dancer, she performed in many dancing scenes. Though Aw did not manage a Best Actress nomination at Star Awards 2005, she won her third \"Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes\" award. In 2006, Aw played a schizophrenic character who hated her father in \"C.I.D.\" before starring in \"Through It All\". She clinched her fourth \"Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes\" award at Star Awards 2006. In December 2006, the term Seven Princesses of Mediacorp was coined as part of Mediacorp publication \"iWeekly's\" 476th issue cover story.\n\nAw's drama \"The Peak\" was screened in January 2007. She played Zhong Xiao Yang, a ship construction worker who became wheelchair-bound after saving her boyfriend. The drama was filmed around the time of Aw's loss of her godmother, and while many expected her to be nominated for Best Actress at the annual Star Awards, she did not manage a return to the nominees list. In July, Aw was involved in \"Switched!\" starring opposite Fann Wong, where she played Jiang Xinhui, a famous, willful and materialistic actress. Her final 2007 drama, \"Dear, Dear Son-In-Law\", was screened in October 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Aw spent four months filming in China for the Chinese production \"The Shaolin Warriors.\" She then starred as Chen Xiaorou in \"Rhythm of Life and\" Lin Keyi in \"The Defining Moment\" where she was praised for her good acting. Then came Aw's big opportunity: to star in Mediacorp's mega-blockbuster production, \"The Little Nyonya\". Several actresses auditioned for the main female lead role for which Aw was selected. Many viewers saw it as a series conceived to boost Aw's television career and to secure the Best Actress award for her at the following Star Awards, and criticism was leveled at Mediacorp's bias towards Aw. Several viewers also believed that the producers intentionally wrote Aw's first role as a mute in attempt to conceal her imperfect delivery of Mandarin. In response, producers lauded Aw's work, saying that she performed in a professional manner. Aw's dual portrayal of Yamamoto Yueniang and Huang Juxiang (the mother to her primary character) was also praised by members of the audience. The drama became the most watched Singapore drama in 15 years and was a huge success. Aw gained many more fans and was hailed as the third-generation \"Ah Jie.\" Despite receiving a third Best Actress nomination at Star Awards 2009, Aw surprisingly lost to her co-star Joanne Peh. In end-2009, Aw acted in \"Together\" with Dai Xiangyu for the third time.\n\nIn 2010, Aw played a funeral director hoping to improve people's perceptions of her profession in \"New Beginnings\". She had overcome a health scare during the filming of the drama. Though Aw again failed to win, she clinched her fourth and fifth Best Actress nominations respectively for \"Together\" (2010) and blockbuster drama \"Breakout\" (2011). Originally scheduled to film \"Absolutely Charming\" in 2011, Aw instead joined \"Destiny in Her Hands\" in Malaysia where she suffered a minor facial injury. In September 2011, Aw completed filming for the drama \"Precious\" in China. She played the main lead role and collaborated with Dai Xiangyu – the fifth time in three years. \"Precious\" was the remake of \"The Little Nyonya\", and Aw played three roles (the mother Fang Xi Ruo, the daughter Ling Qian Jin and Qian Jin's granddaughter) this time. In 2012, she also filmed \"Rescue 995\" as Shi Hao Ran. A righteous young lady who is bubbly and cheerful, the role differed from Aw's recent emotional roles. 2012 Channel U drama \"Jump!\" was her first attempt at a laugh-out-loud comedy, making it a surprising and challenging one. In December that year, Aw played a girl with eyes that can see through anyone's inner world in \"Beyond\".\n\nSaid to be Aw's second breakthrough drama, \"The Dream Makers\" was Channel 8's 2013 mid-year blockbuster, which featured a grand cast including Zoe Tay, Chen Li Ping, Chen Han Wei, Qi Yu Wu and Rui En. In the drama, Aw played a C-list actress who tries hard to make her way to fame. She received numerous positive comments from viewers and compliments from veteran artistes like Zoe Tay, Chen Han Wei, Bryan Wong and Xiang Yun, which made Aw the hot favourite for Best Actress at Star Awards 20. Following a similar loss to Chen Liping at Star Awards 2003 however, she was again beaten to the award by her co-star and broke the record for most nominations (6) without a win. Aw clinched five popularity awards, including \"Favourite Female Character\" and \"Favourite Onscreen Couple\" with Qi Yu Wu for the drama. At the Star Awards 20 Show 1, she became the first artiste to win four awards at a single show since the inception of Star Awards as well as the first to net five awards in a single year. With Aw clinching a tenth and final \"Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes\" award at Star Awards 20 Show 2, she was also the first of the Seven Princesses of Mediacorp to earn the \"All-Time Favourite Artiste\" accolade.\n\nIn 2013, Aw was involved in Channel 8's epic historical drama \"\" which marked her fifth and third collaboration with Elvin Ng and Joanne Peh respectively. Along with cast members Ng and Desmond Tan, Aw promoted the drama – then airing on PPCTV – in Cambodia. In celebration of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, she acted in the football-themed drama \"World at Your Feet\" and its spin-off, \"Unexpected Strangers\", a telemovie made for Mediacorp's on-demand service Toggle. In August 2014, Aw played a tomboy chef in \"Spice Up\" before starring in \"\", the second part of \"The Journey\" trilogy. Her onscreen combination with co-star Shaun Chen was celebrated for evoking memories of their \"Holland V\" pairing.\n\nIn February 2015, Aw played a fashionable single blogger known for baring her break-up experiences and shaming her exes online in Channel U drama \"Let It Go\". She nabbed six awards at the Star Awards 2015 Show 1 before receiving her All-Time Favourite Artiste award after winning the Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes award from 2003–2006, 2009-2014 respectively at Star Awards 2015 Show 2 with Vivian Lai. In July 2015, she guest starred in \"\", thus becoming the only cast member to have appeared in all three installments of the trilogy.\n\nIt was announced in May that year that Aw would play Zhao Fei Er for the second time in blockbuster drama \"The Dream Makers II\", the sequel to the 2013 hit series. Even before filming begun, Aw's Best Actress award chances at the following year's Star Awards were highlighted. Aw explained that her character would suffer from depression and she has done some research on the characteristics and behaviour of depression patients to better portray her role. In July, Aw and co-star Zoe Tay promoted the drama at the China International Film & TV Programs Exhibition in Beijing. Later in November, Aw's debut film, \"Find My Dad\", grossed $37,850 over a 14-day limited release. Produced in Malaysia in 2012, Aw played a single mother. At the inaugural PPCTV MediaCorp Awards in Cambodia, Aw was the most decorated artiste, nabbing \"Favourite Lead Actress\" and \"Favourite Female TV Character\" for portraying Zhao Fei Er in \"The Dream Makers\". Following the airing of \"The Dream Makers II\" in December\",\" Aw's embodiment of the role was lauded. She went on to clinch the awards for \"Best Actress\", \"Favourite Female Character\" and \"Favourite Onscreen Couple\" at Star Awards 2016.\n\nAw later starred in mid-year blockbuster drama \"The Dream Job\" and netted her eighth \"Best Actress\" nomination at Star Awards 2017 thereafter. She played a triad gangster in season two of the Channel 8 long-form TV drama, 118, and was injured by a shattered glass door during its filming. In March 2017, it was announced that Aw would star in \"Ramen Teh\", a film co-produced by Japan and Singapore, alongside Seiko Matsuda, Takumi Saito and Mark Lee. The film started shooting in Singapore in July and had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival in February the next year. Aw later attended a screening at the San Sebastián International Film Festival and its Paris premiere in September 2018. In limited reporting, \"Ramen Teh\" grossed $26,149 in Colombia, $9,384 in Czech Republic, $472,940 in France and $72,984 in Spain.\n\nAw announced her departures from both Hype Records and Mediacorp in October 2017, saying it was time to move on. In November 2018, Aw starred in \"Till We Meet Again\", a drama serial produced by Wawa Pictures and her first drama since going solo. Aw played Tang Xin, the antagonist in the production, and suggested that it might be her final drama. Aw begun filming showbiz-themed drama \"After The Stars\" in July 2019.\n\nAw is the founder of the production company Picturesque Films. In 2017, Aw wrote, directed, and produced \"The Last Entry\", a short film inspired by her godmother's struggles with Alzheimer's disease. The film was selected from over 10,000 films submitted from more than 130 countries and regions around the world for the official competition of Tokyo's Short Shorts Film Festival & Asia 2018. Aw was also invited as one of three competing filmmakers to set a one-minute short of Tokyo as part of the Tokyo Cinema Ensemble project for screening at the Festival Awards Ceremony. \"The Last Entry\" eventually missed out on the top prize and eligibility for nomination at the 91st Academy Awards.\n\nAw filmed a short film \"Senses\" in Takasaki, Japan in December 2018 – with a local and Japanese crew. The team in Japan, whom Aw got to know on the set of \"Ramen Teh\", helped her with logistics and auditions in the country.\n\nFollowing her performance in \"Ramen Teh\" which is partly set in Takasaki, Aw was appointed the city's PR ambassador in September 2018. According to the Letter of Appointment, Aw \"shall endeavour to promote the city’s tourism, products and information to Singapore and the world\".\n\nFrom 2001 to 2002, Aw made her first commercials for AsiaOne, Glamour Shot, OTO, Singtel, and Sony Batteries. She then endorsed LifePharm \"Intenz Skin Activator\" and Pokka \"Vegetable Juice\" in 2003, and with her rising popularity in 2004, Aw became the official ambassadress for SK Jewellery for the first time. This was followed by StarHub \"i-mode\" in 2005 and 2006. With the roaring success of \"The Little Nyonya\", Aw picked up endorsement opportunities for IZU, Kim Robinson, NETS, New Moon, OSIM \"uSqueez Warm\", and Sakura International Buffet Restaurant. From 2010 to 2012, she modeled for Olay \"Regenerist\", OWL, and Reduze as well as SK Jewellery again, and was named the queen of endorsements. In July 2015, Aw began to appear in advertisements for Bio-Essence, a skincare company.\n\nAw is a Montblanc brand ambassador, notably gracing the 2016 launch of the Bohème Lady collection with Miss World 2007 Zhang Zilin and film director and screenwriter Xue Xiaolu. Together with executive Chinese chef Brian Wong of Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel's Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant, Aw created a Peranakan-Chinese fusion menu as part of American Express' Love Dining programme in 2017. Aw became the ambassador of ClearSK in December 2017, before representing global brand Lancôme in August 2019.\n\nAw has visited children's homes and made overseas volunteer trips for underprivileged children. In 2012, Aw collaborated with Precious Moments and reportedly received a five-figure sum which she donated to a charity for children with cancer. In May 2016, Aw, a brand ambassador for Bulgari, helped to raise funds for a Save the Children program in Vietnam.\n\nAw published her debut book, \"Jeanette Aw: Definitions\", in February 2012 containing aspects of her personal life. In this work, which includes black-and-white photos and sketches she drew, Aw defined what was important to her in words from A to Z. Among the revelations was a breast cancer scare in 2010 – she discovered a lump in her breast, but it turned out to be benign. Aw also wrote about playing mother to her three young godchildren as well as her interest in drawing and sketching. The title topped the best-selling lists of all major Singapore bookstores. A month later, Aw released \"Jeanette Aw: Definitions (Limited Edition)\".\n\nIn May 2015, Aw followed up with her second book, \"Sol's World: Somebody to Love\", concerning the titular character's journey of self-discovery. The picture book is the result of over two years of hard work and all illustrations were hand-painted. The character Sol began as an illustration which accompanied Aw's column in Mediacorp publication \"iWeekly\" in 2010. Over the years, she grew attached to the character and decided to make Sol the central figure of this book. As part of its Children's Season \"Masak Masak 2015\", Aw's artwork from the book and new drawings were exhibited at the National Museum of Singapore from May to August 2015. The \"Sol's World: Somebody to Love\" exhibition included her display \"Simple Pleasures in Life & Life's Best Journey is with The One You Love\" and two other artist interpretations of her book.\n\nInspired by the popularity of \"The Little Nyonya\", Aw headlined \"The Peranakan Ball\" in May 2009 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium and paired up with Dai Xiangyu again. Other cast members of the musical included veteran Mediacorp artistes like Xiang Yun, Ann Kok and Rayson Tan as well as Project SuperStar's Chen Diya and Carrie Yeo.\n\nAw performed at Singapore Day in Shanghai in 2011 and 2015.\n\nIn November 2015, Aw became the latest Singapore television celebrity to take to the stage in a re-staging of Dick Lee and Michael Chiang's iconic musical \"Beauty World\" at Victoria Theatre. She played the character Lulu, a vindictive cabaret queen. Aw was commended for her \"convincing acting\" and her \"perfect\" enactment as she \"gave off the vibe of a cunning and manipulative cabaret queen easily\" without a single word spoken. Despite criticism of Aw's vocal abilities, director Dick Lee praised her overall performance.\n\nIn June 2018, Aw moved to Bangkok and enrolled in the Diplôme de Pâtisserie course at the Le Cordon Bleu Dusit Culinary School. She was appointed International Brand Ambassador of the school. Aw has plans to open a cafe or restaurant eventually, but may kick things off with a pop-up. Aw is completing her course at Le Cordon Bleu Tokyo in Daikanyamachō, Shibuya.\n\n\"Jeanius (Singapore)\" is Aw's official fan club and was established on 29 December 2004. The club's name is derived from Aw's first name, Jeanette, and the word \"genius\". It is the only official fan club acknowledged by Aw. Over the years, the club has worked closely with Aw's past management, Artiste Networks (under Hype Records). \"Jeanius (Singapore)\" has expanded its fan base to regional countries such as Cambodia, China, and Malaysia.\n\nWhen her close friend died soon after giving birth to triplets, Aw stepped in to provide maternal care. She has nurtured the children and cared for their emotional and intellectual growth since then, telephoning them daily and visiting them as often as three times a week. The children's father, who was working for an events company, traveled often, so the children were often in Aw's care.\n\nAs of 2015, Aw was in a relationship with her Caucasian boyfriend of nine years.\n\nAw is one of the most popular actresses in Singapore, and she keeps her personal life well-guarded. Aw has appeared on the covers of lifestyle magazines, ranging from Mediacorp publications like \"8 Days\", \"Elle\" \"Singapore\", \"iWeekly\", \"Style:Weddings\" and \"uWeekly\" as well as SPH magazines like \"Cleo\" \"Singapore\", \"Female\", \"Her World\", \"ICON\", \"Nuyou\", \"Nuyou Time\" and \"Simply Her\" to others like \"#313Foodie\", \"Citta Bella\", \"Ezyhealth\" and \"LiveWell\" (all Singapore), \"Citta Bella\", \"Feminine\", \"My Wedding\", \"Oriental Cuisine\" and \"Sisters\" (all Malaysia) and \"Ladies\" (Cambodia). From 2007 to 2009, \"FHM\" \"Singapore\" ranked her among the \"Top 100 Sexiest Women\".\n\nAw is also the only Singapore television actress with at least a million Facebook fans. As of December 2018, Aw has 369,000 followers on Instagram. Along with seven triumphs at the Singapore Blog Awards and the \"Social Media Award\" at Star Awards in 2014 and 2015, Aw was popularly referred to as Caldecott Hill's social media queen.\n\nOften pitted against fellow Singaporean actress Rui En by local television audiences, the pair had swept popularity awards like \"Favourite Female Character\" and \"Favourite Onscreen Couple\" throughout the history of these categories at the annual Star Awards. Aw had clarified that there was no personal rivalry, something Rui En also described as having \"outgrown the whole princesses thing\". Ken Lim, owner of Hype Records which used to manage both actresses together, added, \"Rui En and Jeanette appeal to different fans, and this is why they are both at the top of their game. Rui En is the one with the attitude, while Jeanette is relatable.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1862226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862226", "title": "Bag valve mask", "text": "Bag valve mask\n\nA bag valve mask (BVM), sometimes known by the proprietary name Ambu bag or generically as a manual resuscitator or \"self-inflating bag\", is a hand-held device commonly used to provide positive pressure ventilation to patients who are not breathing or not breathing adequately. The device is a required part of resuscitation kits for trained professionals in out-of-hospital settings (such as ambulance crews) and is also frequently used in hospitals as part of standard equipment found on a crash cart, in emergency rooms or other critical care settings. Underscoring the frequency and prominence of BVM use in the United States, the American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiac Care recommend that \"all healthcare providers should be familiar with the use of the bag-mask device.\" Manual resuscitators are also used within the hospital for temporary ventilation of patients dependent on mechanical ventilators when the mechanical ventilator needs to be examined for possible malfunction or when ventilator-dependent patients are transported within the hospital. Two principal types of manual resuscitators exist; one version is self-filling with air, although additional oxygen (O) can be added but is not necessary for the device to function. The other principal type of manual resuscitator (flow-inflation) is heavily used in non-emergency applications in the operating room to ventilate patients during anesthesia induction and recovery.\n\nUse of manual resuscitators to ventilate a patient is frequently called \"bagging\" the patient and is regularly necessary in medical emergencies when the patient's breathing is insufficient (respiratory failure) or has ceased completely (respiratory arrest). Use of the manual resuscitator force-feeds air or oxygen into the lungs in order to inflate them under pressure, thus constituting a means to manually provide positive-pressure ventilation. It is used by professional rescuers in preference to mouth-to-mouth ventilation, either directly or through an adjunct such as a pocket mask.\n\nThe bag-valve mask concept was developed in 1953 by the German engineer Holger Hesse and his partner, Danish anaesthetist Henning Ruben, following their initial work on a suction pump. Hesse's company was later renamed Ambu A/S, which has manufactured and marketed the device since the late 1950s. The full-form of AMBU is Artificial Manual Breathing Unit. An Ambu bag is a self-inflating bag resuscitator from Ambu A/S, which still manufactures and markets self-inflating bag resuscitators.\n\nToday there are several manufacturers of self-inflating bag resuscitators. Some, like the original Ambu bag, are durable and intended for reuse after thorough cleaning. Others are inexpensive and intended for a single use.\n\nInitially produced in one size, BVMs are now available in sizes for use with infants, children or adults.\n\nThe BVM consists of a flexible air chamber (the \"bag\", roughly a foot in length), attached to a face mask via a shutter valve. When the face mask is properly applied and the \"bag\" is squeezed, the device forces air through into the patient's lungs; when the bag is released, it self-inflates from its other end, drawing in either ambient air or a low pressure oxygen flow supplied by a regulated cylinder, while also allowing the patient's lungs to deflate to the ambient environment (not the bag) past the one way valve.\n\nBag and valve combinations can also be attached to an alternative airway adjunct, instead of to the mask. For example, it can be attached to an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway. Small heat and moisture exchangers, or humidifying/bacterial filters, can be used.\n\nA bag-valve mask can be used without being attached to an oxygen tank to provide \"room air\" (21% oxygen) to the patient. However, manual resuscitator devices also can be connected to a separate bag reservoir, which can be filled with pure oxygen from a compressed oxygen source, thus increasing the amount of oxygen delivered to the patient to nearly 100%.\n\nBag-valve masks come in different sizes to fit infants, children, and adults. The face mask size may be independent of the bag size; for example, a single pediatric-sized bag might be used with different masks for multiple face sizes, or a pediatric mask might be used with an adult bag for patients with small faces.\n\nMost types of the device are disposable and therefore single use, while others are designed to be cleaned and reused.\n\nManual resuscitator cause the gas inside the inflatable bag portion to be force-fed to the patient via a one-way valve when compressed by the rescuer; the gas is then ideally delivered through a mask and into the patient's trachea, bronchus and into the lungs. In order to be effective, a bag valve mask must deliver between 500 and 800 milliliters of air to a normal male adult patient's lungs, but if supplemental oxygen is provided 400 ml may still be adequate. Squeezing the bag once every 5 to 6 seconds for an adult or once every 3 seconds for an infant or child provides an adequate respiratory rate (10–12 respirations per minute in an adult and 20 per minute in a child or infant).\n\nProfessional rescuers are taught to ensure that the mask portion of the BVM is properly sealed around the patient's face (that is, to ensure proper \"mask seal\"); otherwise, pressure needed to force-inflate the lungs is released to the environment. This is difficult when a single rescuer attempts to maintain a face mask seal with one hand while squeezing the bag with other. Therefore, common protocol uses two rescuers: one rescuer to hold the mask to the patient's face with both hands and focus entirely on maintaining a leak-proof mask seal, while the other rescuer squeezes the bag and focuses on breath (or tidal volume) and timing.\n\nAn endotracheal tube (ET) can be inserted by an advanced practitioner and can substitute for the mask portion of the manual resuscitator. This provides more secure air passage between the resuscitator and the patient, since the ET tube is sealed with an inflatable cuff within the trachea (or windpipe), so any regurgitation is less likely to enter the lungs, and so that forced inflation pressure can only go into the lungs and not inadvertently go to the stomach (see \"complications\", below). The ET tube also maintains an open and secure airway at all times, even during CPR compressions; as opposed to when a manual resuscitator is used with a mask when a face mask seal can be difficult to maintain during compressions.\n\nAirway obstruction is a leading cause of death in battlefield trauma. Airway management in combat is very different from its civilian equivalent. In combat, maxillofacial trauma is the primary cause of airway obstruction. The injury is frequently complicated by a struggling patient, distorted anatomy and blood, and these injuries often have significant associated hemorrhage from accompanying vascular injuries.\n\nMilitary paramedics face extreme challenges, including \"darkness, hostile fire, resource limitations, prolonged evacuation times, unique casualty transportation issues, command and tactical decisions affecting health care, hostile environments and provider experience levels\". They often have to treat multiple casualties using only the equipment they are carrying on their backs. Therefore, space is of primary importance and compact bag valve masks, such as a Pocket BVM, have been created to save valuable space in the emergency kit.\n\nUnder normal breathing, the lungs inflate under a slight vacuum when the chest wall muscles and diaphragm expand; this \"pulls\" the lungs open, causing air to enter the lungs to inflate under a gentle vacuum. However, when using a manual resuscitator, as with other methods of positive-pressure ventilation, the lungs are force-inflated with pressurized air or oxygen. This inherently leads to risk of various complications, many of which depend on whether the manual resuscitator is being used with a face mask or ET tube. Complications are related to over-inflating or over-pressurizing the patient, which can cause: (1) air to inflate the stomach (called gastric insufflation); (2) lung injury from over-stretching (called volutrauma); or (3) lung injury from over-pressurization (called barotrauma).\n\nWhen a face mask is used in conjunction with a manual resuscitator, the intent is for the force-delivered air or oxygen to inflate the lungs. However air entering the patient also has access to the stomach via the esophagus, which can inflate if the resuscitator is squeezed too hard (causing air flow that is too rapid for the lungs to absorb alone) or too much (causing excess air to divert to the stomach).\" Gastric inflation can lead to vomiting and subsequent aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs, which has been cited as a major hazard of bag-valve-mask ventilation, with one study suggesting this effect is difficult to avoid even for the most skilled and experienced users, stating \"When using a self-inflatable bag, even experienced anesthesiologists in our study may have performed ventilation with too short inspiratory times or too large tidal volumes, which resulted in stomach inflation in some cases.\" The study goes on to state that \"Stomach inflation is a complex problem that may cause regurgitation, [gastric acid] aspiration, and, possibly, death.\" When stomach inflation leads to vomiting of highly acidic stomach acids, delivery of subsequent breaths can force these caustic acids down into the lungs where they cause life-threatening or fatal lung injuries including Mendelson's syndrome, aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and \"pulmonary injuries similar to that seen in victims of chlorine gas exposure\". Apart from the risks of gastric inflation causing vomiting and regurgitation, at least two reports have been found indicating that gastric insufflation remains clinically problematic even when vomiting does not occur. In one case of failed resuscitation (leading to death), gastric insufflation in a 3-month-old boy put sufficient pressure against the lungs that \"precluded effective ventilation\". Another reported complication was a case of stomach rupture caused by stomach over-inflation from a manual resuscitator. The causative factors and degree of risk of inadvertent stomach inflation have been examined, with one published study revealing that during prolonged resuscitation up to 75% of air delivered to the patient may inadvertently be delivered to the stomach instead of the lungs.\n\nWhen an endotracheal tube (ET) is placed, one of the key advantages is that a direct air-tight passageway is provided from the output of the manual resuscitator to the lungs, thus eliminating the possibilities of inadvertent stomach inflation or lung injuries from gastric acid aspiration. However this places the lungs at increased risk from separate lung injury patterns caused by accidental forced over-inflation (called volutrauma or barotrauma). Sponge-like lung tissue is delicate, and over-stretching can lead to adult respiratory distress syndrome – a condition that requires prolonged mechanical ventilator support in the ICU and is associated with poor survival (\"e.g.\", 50%), and significantly increased care costs of up to $30,000 per day. Lung volutrauma, which can be caused by \"careful\" delivery of large, slow breaths, can also lead to a \"popped\" or collapsed lung (called a pneumothorax), with at least one published report describing \"a patient in whom a sudden tension pneumothorax developed during ventilation with a bag-valve device.\" Additionally, there is at least one report of manual resuscitator use where the lungs were accidentally over-inflated to the point where \"the heart contained a large volume of air,\" and the \"aorta and pulmonary arteries were filled with air\" – a condition called an air embolism which \"is almost uniformly fatal\". However, the case was of a 95-year-old woman, as the authors point out that this type of complication has previously only been reported in premature infants.\n\nTwo factors appear to make the public particularly at risk from complications from manual resuscitators: (1) their prevalence of use (leading to high probability of exposure), and (2) apparent inability for providers to protect patients from uncontrolled, inadvertent, forced over-inflation.\n\nManual resuscitators are commonly used for temporary ventilation support, especially flow-inflation versions that are used during anesthesia induction/recovery during routine surgery. Accordingly, most citizens are likely to be \"bagged\" at least once during their lifetime as they undergo procedures involving general anesthesia. Additionally, a significant number of newborns are ventilated with infant-sized manual resuscitators to help stimulate normal breathing, making manual resuscitators among the very first therapeutic medical devices encountered upon birth. As previously stated, manual resuscitators are the first-line device recommended for emergency artificial ventilation of critical care patients, and are thus used not only throughout hospitals but also in out-of-hospital care venues by firefighters, paramedics and outpatient clinic personnel.\n\nManual resuscitators have no built-in tidal volume control — the amount of air used to force-inflate the lungs during each breath depends entirely on how much the operator squeezes the bag. In response to the dangers associated with use of manual resuscitators, specific guidelines from the American Heart Association and European Resuscitation Council were issued that specify recommended maximal tidal volumes (or breath sizes) and ventilation rates safe for patients. While no studies are known that have assessed the frequency of complications or deaths due to uncontrolled manual resuscitator use, numerous peer-reviewed studies have found that, despite established safety guidelines, the incidence of provider over-inflation with manual resuscitators continues to be \"endemic\" and unrelated to provider training or skill level. Another clinical study found \"the tidal volume delivered by a manual resuscitator shows large variations\", concluding that \"the manual resuscitator is not a suitable device for accurate ventilation.\" A separate assessment of another high-skilled group with frequent emergency use of manual resuscitators (ambulance paramedics) found that \"Despite seemingly adequate training, EMS personnel consistently hyperventilated patients during out-of-hospital CPR\", with the same research group concluding that \"Unrecognized and inadvertent hyperventilation may be contributing to the currently dismal survival rates from cardiac arrest.\" A peer-reviewed study published in 2012 assessed the possible incidence of uncontrolled over-inflation in newborn neonates, finding that \"a large discrepancy between the delivered and the current guideline values was observed for all parameters,\" and that \"regardless of profession or handling technique ... 88.4% delivered excessive pressures, whereas ... 73.8% exceeded the recommended range of volume\", concluding that \"the great majority of participants from all professional groups delivered excessive pressures and volumes.\" A further examination has recently been made to assess whether a solution to the over-ventilation problem may lie with use of pediatric-sized manual resuscitators in adults or use of more advanced flow-inflation (or \"Mapleson C\") versions of manual resuscitators: while \"the paediatric self-inflating bag delivered the most guideline-consistent ventilation\", it did not lead to full guideline compliance as \"participants hyperventilated patients' lungs in simulated cardiac arrest with all three devices.\"\n\n\"Hyperventilation\" can be achieved through delivery of (1) too many breaths per minute; (2) breaths that are too large and exceed the patient's natural lung capacity; or (3) a combination of both. With use of manual resuscitators, neither rate nor inflating volumes can be physically controlled through built-in safety adjustments within the device, and as highlighted above, studies show providers frequently exceed designated safety guidelines for both ventilation rate (10 breaths per minute) and volume (5–7 mL/kg body weight) as outlined by the American Heart Association and European Resuscitation Council. Numerous studies have concluded that ventilation at rates in excess of current guidelines are capable of interfering with blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, however the pre-clinical experiments associated with these findings involved delivery of inspiratory volumes in excess of current guidelines, \"e.g.\", they assessed the effects of hyperventilation via both excessive rate and excessive volumes simultaneously. A more recent study published in 2012 expanded knowledge on this topic by evaluating the separate effects of (1) isolated excessive rate with guideline-compliant inspiratory volumes; (2) guideline-compliant rate with excessive inspiratory volumes; and (3) combined guideline non-compliance with both excessive rate and volume. This study found that excessive rate more than triple the current guideline (\"e.g.\", 33 breaths per minute) may not interfere with CPR when inspiratory volumes are delivered within guideline-compliant levels, suggesting that ability to keep breath sizes within guideline limits may individually mitigate clinical dangers of excessive rate. It was also found that when guideline-excessive tidal volumes were delivered, changes in blood flow were observed that were transient at low ventilation rates but sustained when both tidal volumes and rates were simultaneously excessive, suggesting that guideline-excessive tidal volume is the principal mechanism of side effects, with ventilation rate acting as a multiplier of these effects. Consistent with previous studies where both excessive rate and volumes were found to produce side effects of blood flow interference during CPR, a complicating factor may be inadequate time to permit full expiration of oversized breaths in between closely spaced high-rate breaths, leading to the lungs never being permitted to fully exhale between ventilations (also called \"stacking\" of breaths). A recent advancement in the safety of manual ventilation may be the growing use of time-assist devices that emit an audible or visual metronome tone or flashing light at the proper guideline-designated rate interval for breath frequency; one study found these devices may lead to near 100% guideline compliance for ventilation rate. While this advancement appears to provide a solution to the \"rate problem\" associated with guideline-excessive manual resuscitator use, it may not address the \"volume problem\", which may continue to make manual resuscitators a patient hazard, as complications can still occur from over-inflation even when rate is delivered within guidelines.\n\nCurrently, the only devices that can deliver pre-set, physician-prescribed inflation volumes reliably within safety guidelines are mechanical ventilators that require an electrical power source or a source of compressed oxygen, a higher level of training to operate, and typically cost hundreds to thousands of dollars more than a disposable manual resuscitator.\n\nA filter is sometimes placed between the mask and the bag (before or after the valve) to prevent contamination of the bag.\n\nSome devices have PEEP valve connectors, for better positive airway pressure maintenance.\n\nA covered port may be incorporated into the valve assembly to allow inhalatory medicines to be injected into the airflow, which may be particularly effective in treating patients in respiratory arrest from severe asthma.\n\nA separate covered port may be included into the valve assembly to enable a pressure-monitoring device to be attached, enabling rescuers to continuously monitor the amount of positive-pressure being generated during forced lung inflation.\n\nA pressure relief valve (often known as a \"pop-up valve\") is typically included in pediatric versions and some adult versions, the purpose of which is to prevent accidental over-pressurization of the lungs. A bypass clip is usually incorporated into this valve assembly in case medical needs call for inflation at a pressure beyond the normal cutoff of the pop-up valve.\n\nSome bags are designed to collapse for storage. A bag not designed to store collapsed may lose elasticity when stored compressed for long periods, reducing its effectiveness. The collapsible design has longitudinal scoring so that the bag collapses on the scoring \"pivot point,\" opposite to the direction of normal bag compression.\n\nIn a hospital, long-term mechanical ventilation is provided by using a more complex, automated ventilator. However a frequent use of a manual resuscitator is to temporarily provide manual ventilation whenever troubleshooting of the mechanical ventilator is needed, if the ventilator circuit needs to be changed, or if there is a loss of electrical power or source of compressed air or oxygen.\n\nA rudimentary type of mechanical ventilator device that has the advantage of not needing electricity is a flow-restricted, oxygen-powered ventilation device (FROPVD). These are similar to manual resuscitators in that oxygen is pushed through a mask to force-inflate the patient's lungs, but unlike a manual resuscitator where the pressure used to force-inflate the patient's lungs comes from a person manually squeezing a bag, with the FROPVD the pressure needed to force-inflate the lungs comes directly from a pressurized oxygen cylinder. These devices will stop functioning when the compressed oxygen tank becomes depleted.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1862246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862246", "title": "Great Peacemaker", "text": "Great Peacemaker\n\nThe Great Peacemaker (\"Skennenrahawi\" [skʌ̃.nʌ̃.ɾahawi] in Mohawk), sometimes referred to as Deganawida or Dekanawida (as a mark of respect, some Iroquois avoid using his personal name except in special circumstances) was by tradition, along with Jigonhsasee and Hiawatha, the founder of the \"Haudenosaunee\", commonly called the Iroquois Confederacy. This is a political and cultural union of five Iroquoian-speaking Native American tribes residing in the present-day state of New York, northern Pennsylvania, and the eastern portion of the province of Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe Great Peacemaker's name means \"Two River Currents Flowing Together\". Some of the numerous legends about the Great Peacemaker have conflicting information. It is reported that he was born a Huron, and by some accounts, his mother was a virgin, making the birth miraculous. Others say he was born an Onondaga and later adopted by the Mohawk.\n\nBy all accounts, the Great Peacemaker was a prophet who counseled peace among the warring tribes, and he called for an end to ritual cannibalism. According to some legends, his first ally was Jigonhsasee. She lent her home for the meeting of the leaders of the rival tribal nations. The Great Peacemaker's follower Hiawatha, an Onondaga renowned for his oratory, helped him achieve his vision of bringing the tribes together in peace.\n\nAccording to the archaeologist Dean Snow, the Great Peacemaker converted Hiawatha in the territory of the Onondaga; he traveled alone to visit the Mohawk tribe who lived near what is now Cohoes, New York. Other traditional accounts hold that the Great Peacemaker consulted with Jigonhsasee about which tribal leaders to approach and she facilitated that meeting to create the confederacy.\n\nAccording to some legends, initially the Mohawk rejected the message of the Great Peacemaker, so he decided to perform a feat to demonstrate his purity and spiritual power. After climbing a tree high above Kahon:ios (Cohoes Falls), the Great Peacemaker told the Mohawk warriors to chop the tree down. Many onlookers watched as the Great Peacemaker disappeared into the swirling rapids of the Mohawk River. They believed he had died but the next morning they found him sitting near a campfire. Greatly impressed by the Great Peacemaker's miraculous survival, the Mohawk became the founding tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe tribes gathered at Onondaga Lake, where they planted a Tree of Peace and proclaimed the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe dates Dekanawida lived, and thus the founding of the Confederacy, have not been identified with certainty. Historians and archeologists have researched an incident related in the oral history of the founding of the Confederacy. As recorded by later scholars, one account relates there was a violent conflict among the Seneca, who were the last Iroquois nation to join the confederacy as a founding member. Their violence stopped when the sun darkened and the day seemed to turn to night. Since 1902 scholars have studied the possibility that this event was a solar eclipse, as William Canfield suggested in his \"Legends of the Iroquois; told by \"the Cornplanter\" \". As scholars have learned more about the representation of natural events in oral histories, scholars into the 21st century have noted eclipses that could serve to date the founding of the Confederacy, in addition to the archeological evidence. Scholars referring to an eclipse have included (chronologically): Paul A. W. Wallace, Elizabeth Tooker, Bruce E. Johansen, Dean R. Snow, Barbara A. Mann and Jerry L. Fields, William N. Fenton, David Henige, Gary Warrick, and Neta Crawford.\n\nSince Canfield's first mention, and the majority view, scholars have widely supported a date of 1451 AD as being of a known solar eclipse and the likely founding date based on this oral account and other evidence. Some argue it is an insufficient fit for the description, and favor a date of 1142, when there was also a documented solar eclipse. A few question dating the founding of the confederacy based on the mention of the eclipse.\n\nArcheological investigation has contributed to discussions about the founding date, as its evidence can be dated and correlated to natural events. In 1982 archeologist Dean Snow said that evidence from mainstream archeology did not support a founding of the confederacy for any dates of an eclipse before 1350 AD (thus ruling out the 1142 AD date.) By 1998 Fenton considered an eclipse earlier than the 1451 AD majority view unlikely, but possible as long as it was after 1000 AD. By 2007/8 reviews considered an 1142 AD eclipse as a possible point of reference, even if most scholars supported 1451 AD as the safe choice.\n\nThis confederacy influenced the United States Constitution and Anglo-American ideas of democracy, as recognized by Concurrent Resolution 331 issued by the U. S. Congress in 1988, which states in part:Whereas the original framers of the Constitution, including, most notably, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, are known to have greatly admired the concepts of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy; Whereas the confederation of the original Thirteen Colonies into one republic was influenced by the political system developed by the Iroquois Confederacy as were many of the democratic principles which were incorporated into the Constitution itself\n\nThe Great Peacemaker established a council of clan and village chiefs to govern the confederacy. In each tribe, which had matrilineal kinship systems of descent and property-holding, power was shared between the sexes. Men held the positions of hereditary chiefs through their mother's line; clan mothers ruled on the fitness of chiefs and could depose of any that they opposed. Most decisions in council were made by consensus, to which each representative had an equal voice. Early anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan attributed the regional dominance achieved by the Iroquois to their superior organization and coordination compared to other tribes; George Hunt also thought there was a factor of economic determinism, with their need for furs for the European trade and their superior geographic position controlling most of central and western New York. The oral laws and customs of the Great Law of Peace became the constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy, established by the 16th century or earlier.\n\nThe Great Peacemaker worked all his life to bring his vision to fruition. He prophesied that a \"white serpent\" would come to his people's lands and make friends with them, only to deceive them later. A \"red serpent\" would later make war against the \"white serpent\", but a Native American boy would be given a great power. He would be accepted as a chosen leader by the people of \"the land of the hilly country.\" The boy stays neutral in the fight, and he speaks to the people, who number as the blades of grass, but he is heard by all. After a season, a \"black serpent\" would come and defeat both the \"white\" and \"red serpents\". According to the prophecy, when the people gathered under the elm tree become humble, all three \"serpents\" would be blinded by a light many times brighter than the sun. \"Deganawidah\" said that he would be that light. His nation would accept the \"white serpent\" into their safekeeping like a long-lost brother.\n\nSome members of the Bahá'í Faith have connected the signs of a Prophet, as described by Bahá'u'lláh (Prophet-founder of the Baha'i Faith), with the Peacemaker. As such, many Native American Bahá'ís in North America (and some non-Native) revere the Peacemaker as a Manifestation of God.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The city, named Jiangyang until the Southern and Northern Dynasties, is known as the \"Liquor City\" (). Situated at the confluence of the Tuo River and the Yangtze River, Luzhou is not only an important port on the Yangtze river, but also the largest port in both size and output in Sichuan province since Chongqing seceded from Sichuan province in 1997. \nAt the 2010 census its population was 4,218,427 inhabitants whom 919,832 lived in the built-up (\"or metro\") area made of Jiangyang and Longmatan districts, as Naxi district is not conurbated yet.\nLuzhou, which borders Yunnan, Guizhou and Chongqing, is the only geographic junction of the four provinces, and was therefore the logical place for a port in ancient China. After the PRC was founded in 1949, Luzhou became the capital of southern Sichuan province. In 1983, Luzhou was approved as a prefecture-level city administratively.\n\nLuzhou is best known for its alcoholic beverages, particularly baijiu.\n\nLuzhou was incorporated into the Ba state early in the Shang and Zhou period, in the 11th century BC. In 316 BC, during the Warring States period, King Huiwen of Qin established Ba prefecture, which included most of Luzhou, after he conquered the states of Ba and Shu. The local economy and culture expanded as a result of the advanced production technique and culture introduced by immigrants from the rest of China.\nDuring the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 23), Jiangyang county was set up in what is the current Jiangyang district, at the confluence of the Tuo River and Yangtze River. The county was further expanded during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. As a result, Luzhou became the portal of the Tuojing River leading to western Sichuan, which brought great prosperity to salt-refinery and agriculture in the area.\n\nThe Song Dynasty was an important period in Luzhou’s history. It was known as the natural granary of southern Sichuan as the liquor-distilling and salt-refining industries expanded. The method to decoct salt with natural gas was discovered at that time, according to ancient literature. In addition, trade and business between Luzhou residents and ethnic groups was brisk and a protective wall as well as forts were constructed by the local government.\n\nIn the Yuan Dynasty, Luzhou remained an important place for the liquor-distillation, salt-refinery and tea-making industry and trade. A large number of wooden ships were made to further the shipping industry. During the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911), waves of immigrants from other parts of China brought rapid growth in economy and culture. Luzhou served as a political, economic, military and cultural center for the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army took control of Luzhou on December 6, 1949 from the Kuomintang government, two months after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1960, Luzhou prefecture was created with five counties that had been part of Yibin prefecture. The prefecture was upgraded to the prefecture-level city of Luzhou in 1983. Nowadays, Luzhou is considered a center of the chemical, machinery, and liquor-distilling industries.\n\nLocated in downtown Luzhou, the Bao’en pagoda was built in 1148 at the request of southern Song Dynasty, and was restored in 1983 and 1985, Qing Dynasty.

The Bao’en pagoda was listed by the People’s Government of Sichuan Province as a historical and culture relic under provincial protection in April 1991.\n\nConstructed during the Ming Dynasty, Dragon Head Bridge spans the Nine Bends Creek and is a stone bridge in the style of the Ming Dynasty. It is 5 m high, 54 m long and 1.9 m wide, and has 14 piers. The eight midsection piers are characterized by traditionally carved auspicious beasts, such as dragons, lions, elephants and kylins. It was declared a key national culture relic in 1996.\n\nLongtou Pass, about long, is located in the southern suburban area of Luzhou. Construction began in the Han Dynasty during Emperor Guangxu's reign. Its name, Longtou Pass, derives from its resemblance to a huge dragon crossing the Tuo River in the north and Yangtze river in the south. Longtou Pass is the location where Liu Bocheng waged the Luzhou Uprising. It was listed as a protected historic and cultural relic of Luzhou in 1984 and a provincial one in 1996.\n\nThe Guojiao Square () in a key cultural site of baijiu producer Luzhou Laojiao. The \"Guojiao\" refers to a baijiu fermentation pit that was commissioned in Ming dynasty in 1573 and has been in continuous operation ever since.\nSituated in Xuyong county, the Spring and Autumn Temple was built in 1906, during the Qing Dynasty. Originally, it was a temple for Guany (the Lord of Guan) and then rebuilt as a Shaanxi salt merchants' assembly hall. It has a typical local architecture style, and has been listed as a protected historic and cultural relic of Luzhou.\n\nBaizitu is situated near the Tuojiang river, in the northwestern corner of Luzhou city. It is named for the stone inscription of the Qing Dynasty and was the protected historic and cultural relic of Luzhou.\n\nBuilt in 2015, Luzhou City Park is an important project of Luzhou City in order to promote the ecological environment construction, and upgrade the eco-city level of Luzhou City. The total investment of the project is about 120 million RMB and covers an area of about 107 mu. It is located in the valley of the east of Chengxi Park in Jiangyang, Luzhou. Superior, is expected to receive more than 1.5 million tourists trips each year.\n\nLuzhou is situated in the southeast region of Sichuan province, at the intersection of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and Chongqing, at longitude 105° 08' 41\"E ~ 106° 28'E and latitude 27° 39' N ~ 29° 20'N. Covering an area of , it is wide from east to west and long from south to north.

Other rivers converging here, such as Tuo River, Yongling River, Chishui River, and Laixi Rivers.\n\nLuzhou has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen \"Cfa\") and is largely mild, except during the summer, and humid, with four distinct seasons and ample rainfall: winters are short, mild, and comparatively dry, while summers are long, hot, and humid. Within the prefecture, annual mean temperatures range from . In the urban area, monthly daily average temperatures range from in January to around in July and August, with August being slightly warmer. The diurnal temperature variation is and is lowest during winter. Snow is rare here. The annual precipitation in the prefecture ranges from , 70% of which occurs from May to September. Sunshine is quite low, with only 1200 to 1400 hours per year, and the frost-free period is lengthy, lasting 300 to 358 days.\n\nLuzhou has always been a hub of economic activities in the tri-province border area of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Food, liquor, and chemicals production, along with construction equipment manufacturing are the most important industries of the local economy. Total GDP reached 33.11 billion yuan in 2006 (per capita 7,819 yuan).\n\nLuzhou is a center of liquor production, particularly baijiu. Luzhou Laojiao () and Gulin Langjiu () are the two best known brands with national and international reputation. Over 200 liquor products are listed as national and provincial products with good market share in China and abroad.\n\nLuzhou is a manufacturing center of hydraulic trucks, cranes and excavators in China. Among the cities along the Yangtze River, Luzhou is the second largest producer of hydraulic trucks, after Shanghai.\n\nThe chemical industry, particularly natural gas production, is also important to Luzhou's economy natural gas industry. At present, Luzhou has developed a national chemical industry system covering production, education, scientific research, design, machine and architecture. A group of national large scale enterprises have been established and achieved a globally advanced level. Lutianhua enterprise is the most extensive carbamide and oil chemical production base in China, producing fatty acid, fatty amine, synthetic ammonia, and carbamide. Its annual output of carbamide is 1.24 million tons and 0.9 million tons of synthetic ammonia. It is one of the 500 largest national enterprises. Tianhua Co, Ltd is a key enterprise which brings in 0.3 million tons of synthetic ammonia and 0.6 million tons of carbamide, processing two sets of chemical fertilizer devices with world technical levels. Luzhou Chemical Factory participates in military and civil chemical production. State-owned Torch Chemical Factory is the only producer of \"801\" . It gained the national quality golden award, surpassing the America Standard.\n\nLuzhou is a tourist destination; specific scenic spots include Yuchan in Luxian county, Fobao in Hejiang county, Mt. Fangshan in Jiangyang county, the litchi and longan orchard along the Yangtze River and Tuojiang River, and many others. With the official approbation of the National Ministry of Forestry, Fobao Forest Park became a National Forestry Park and was classified as an “AAA” tourist attraction in 2001 by National Tourism Administration.\n\nLuzhou and Xuyong county have national cultural significance. The Luzhou Old Fermentation Pit (Luzhou Laojiao, ) constructed in Ming Dynasty in 1573 and in continuous operation ever since, and Dragon Head Bridge are listed as key protected cultural relics of the nation. There are more than ten protected historical relics in Sichuan Province, including the site of Red Army’s Four-time Crossing the Chishui River; the Taiping Ferry Museum this site was nominated the “National Demonstration base for patriotic education” by the central Propaganda Ministry in 2001.\n\nThe Sci-tech Park of Luzhou Laojiao is a national industry tourism demonstration spot and Luzhou Zhangba Longan Orchard is a national agricultural tourism spot. Other scenic areas nearby include Leshan, Yibin, Zigong and Chongqing, such as the Bamboo Forest, Mt. Simianshan in Chongqing and Sidong Channel in Guizhou Province.\n\nLuzhou is a key comprehensive development zone in the upper Yangtze River and Sichuan province as well as an important production base of commodity rice, fruit such as litchi and longan, cured tobacco, poultry, tea, and traditional Chinese medicine ingredients.\n\nThe Sichuan Pilot Free Trade Zone (FTZ) officially launched on 1 April 2017, forms part of a third batch of government-endorsed pilot FTZs. All told, the zone covers an area of 119.99 km and consists of three sub-zones: The Chengdu Tianfu New Area (90.32 km inclusive of the Chengdu High-Tech Comprehensive Bonded Area 4 (Shuangliu Park) (4 km) and the Chengdu Airport Bonded Logistics Centre (Type B) (0.09 km)), the Chengdu Qingbaijiang Railway Port Area (9.68 km inclusive of the Chengdu Railway Bonded Logistics Centre (Type B) (0.18 km)), and the Chuannan Lingang Area (19.99 km inclusive of the Luzhou Port Bonded Logistics Centre (Type B) (0.21 km)).\n\nThe Chuannan Lingang Area will focus on developing a range of high quality professional services, including shipping logistics, port trade, education and medical support. As part of its remit, it will also look to nurture the advanced manufacturing industries, as well as looking to take a lead in a number of other sectors, including equipment manufacturing, medicine and food/beverages. Furthermore, it will play a key role in the development of an integrated transport hub, which will provide streamlined connections between the Chengdu-Chongqing city cluster and Yunnan and Guizhou, its southerly neighbours.\n\nExpressways connecting to Chengdu and Chongqing were completed in the 1990s. Railroads and an airport provide additional links to several cities in China. The city has four bridges over the Yangtze which form part of Sichuan's overland corridor to the South China Sea.\n\nG76 national expressway (from Xiamen to Chengdu) connecting Luzhou to Chengdu andu Guiyang, G93 national expressway( Chengdu-Chongqing area circle expressway) connect Luzhou to Chongqing, G4215 national expressway(Chengdu to Zunyi) connect Luzhou to Chengdu and Zunyi. Other main highways includes G321,G353 national highway and several provincial highways.\n\nLuzhou is an important inland port serving as a transshipment point for goods heading to cities deeper into Sichuan such as Chengdu. Making it the largest river port in Sichuan on the upper Yangtze, with the capability to load and unload container ships. The Luzhou International Container Pier handled over 500,000 containers in 2016.\n\nLuzhou Lantian Airport was built in 1945 and initially provided an air route between China and India for the US Air Force during World War II. Services were suspended in the 1960s, but later it was used for training purposes by the Chinese Air Force. Major renovations and expansions were completed in January 2001, and now the airport serves direct flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Kunming, Guiyang, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Hangzhou, Haikou, Changsha, Nanning, Xi'an, Daochengyading, Lanzhou, Lijiang, Nanjing, Wuhan and Zhengzhou .\nThe new Luzhou Airport at Yunlong opened in September 2018, and all services were transferred from Lantian to the new location, 11 km north of the city.\n\n\n"}

The service shall have the capability to interact with the traffic and respond to traffic situations developing in the VTS area\". In the United States of America (USA), VTSs are established and operated by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center. Some VTSs in the USA operate as partnerships between USCG and private agencies. Typical VTS systems use radar, closed-circuit television (CCTV), VHF radiotelephony and automatic identification system to keep track of vessel movements and provide navigational safety in a limited geographical area.\n\nThe VTS guidelines require that the VTS authority should be provided with sufficient staff, appropriately qualified, suitably trained and capable of performing the tasks required, taking into consideration the type and level of services to be provided in conformity with the current IMO guidelines on the subject.\n\nIALA Recommendation V-103 is the Recommendation on Standards for Training and Certification of VTS Personnel.

In the case of ionic crystals, the fluxes of the diffusing species are coupled, while in a plasma the various species diffuse at the same rate.\n\nIn plasma physics, ambipolar diffusion is closely related to the concept of quasineutrality. In most plasmas, the forces acting on the ions are different from those acting on the electrons, so naively one would expect one species to be transported faster than the other, whether by diffusion or convection or some other process. If such differential transport has a divergence, then it results in a change of the charge density. The latter will in turn create an electric field that can alter the transport of one or both species in such a way that they become equal.\n\nThe simplest example is a plasma localized in an unmagnetized vacuum. (See Inertial confinement fusion.) Both electrons and ions will stream outward with their respective thermal velocity. If the ions are relatively cold, their thermal velocity will be small. The thermal velocity of the electrons will be fast due to their high temperature and low mass: formula_1. As the electrons leave the initial volume, they will leave behind a positive charge density of ions, which will result in an outwardly-directed electric field. This field will act on the electrons to slow them down and on the ions to speed them up. The net result is that both ions and electrons stream outward at the speed of sound, formula_2, which is much smaller than the electron thermal velocity, but usually much larger than the ion thermal velocity.\n\nIn astrophysics, \"ambipolar diffusion\" refers specifically to the decoupling of neutral particles from plasma, for example in the initial stage of star formation. The neutral particles in this case are mostly hydrogen molecules in a cloud that would undergo gravitational collapse if they were not collisionally coupled to the plasma. The plasma is composed of ions (mostly protons) and electrons, which are tied to the interstellar magnetic field and therefore resist collapse. In a molecular cloud where the fractional ionization is very low (one part per million or less), neutral particles only rarely encounter charged particles, and so are not entirely hindered in their collapse (note that now is dynamical collapse, not free fall) into a star.\n\n"}

His feud with Steele continued for a month, during which he dropped and recovered the title on March 10, 2001. He feuded over the title for six months, losing and winning it once. By autumn, Colón was involved in a storyline involving Justin McCully, continuing a similar pattern. In early 2002, Colón was involved in a storyline with Rey Mysterio Jr, who defeated Colón for the title on January 6, 2002. Mysterio held the title for two months before dropping it back on April 6, 2002, which marked Colón's final Junior Championship reign. Following a feud with Kid Kash, the belt was held up and Colón ascended to the Heavyweight division.\n\nShortly after Carly Colón signed with WWE, a tournament was organized to determine the new champion. Colón was considered an early favorite and reached the final, but lost. Colón then entered a feud with El Diamante over the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship. In late 2004, Colón was involved in a battle royal for the first contender's position. One week later on November 6, 2004, Colón defeated El Bronco and won the Universal Heavyweight Championship for the first time in his career. He then entered a feud with El Diamante, eventually dropping the title to him. On July 31, 2005, he formed a tag team with his father as part of the Funking Conservatory's television show, !Bang!, competing against Dory Funk, Jr. and Johnny Magnum. The team was victorious, winning the promotion's Television Tag Team Championship. On March 5, 2006, he participated in WCW Saturday Night tribute show World Wrestling Legends: 6:05 - The Reunion, he was defeated by Vampiro. On July 13, 2007 at World Wrestling Council's anniversary event, \"Aniversario 2007\", Colón wrestled Christian Cage in a match that resulted in a double-countout.\n\nOn May 7, 2007, Colón had a closed door workout match before the \"Raw\" television tapings where he was evaluated by the personnel responsible for talent management. The following day, Colón participated in a dark match before that night's \"SmackDown\" television tapings, where he defeated Shannon Moore.\n\nOn January 26, 2008, Colón made his Florida Championship Wrestling debut, defeating Shawn Osbourne. On February 23, Colón and Eric Pérez, collectively known as The Puerto Rican Nightmares, defeated Heath Miller and Steve Lewington in a tournament final to become the inaugural FCW Florida Tag Team Champions. The team lost the title to Brad Allen and Nic Nemeth on March 23, 2008, before winning them back via disqualification on April 15, 2008. They lost the title to Drew McIntyre and Stu Sanders on May 6, 2008. On July 17, Colón and Pérez reclaimed the title by defeating McIntyre and Sanders. On August 16, Colón and Perez lost the title to Nic Nemeth and Gavin Spears.\n\nOn August 18, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Colón made his main roster debut under the ring name Primo Colón and was involved in a backstage segment with Raw General Manager, Mike Adamle, talking about his dislike for his brother Carlito's attitude and how he was nothing like him. His in-ring wrestling debut on the Raw brand took place on August 25, when he defeated Charlie Haas, dressed as Carlito and named Charlito, in singles competition.\n\nAfter only one match on \"Raw\", Primo Colón, now billed as simply Primo, was moved to the SmackDown brand where his animosity for his brother was dropped and they formed a tag team. On the September 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", he teamed with his brother Carlito to defeat WWE Tag Team Champions Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder in a non-title match. Two weeks later, both teams competed in a title rematch, with The Colóns winning to become WWE Tag Team Champions. In January 2009, The Colóns entered a feud with World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz. On the WrestleMania XXV pre-show, The Colóns defeated John Morrison and The Miz in a tag team unification match, becoming the first team to hold the newly dubbed \"Unified WWE Tag Team Championship\". On April 6, they successfully defended their titles for the first time in a rematch.\n\nOn April 15, both Primo and Carlito were drafted back to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental draft. At The Bash, they lost the championship to the team of Edge and Chris Jericho, who were added to a standard tag team match between The Colóns and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) moments before the match started. The Colóns invoked their rematch clause the next night on \"Raw\", but were unsuccessful. On the July 6 episode of \"Raw\", they lost again to Edge and Jericho, and afterwards Carlito attacked Primo, leading to a feud between the two which ended after Carlito defeated Primo on the August 3 episode of \"Raw\". At Night of Champions, Primo competed in a Six-pack challenge for the United States Championship, which Kofi Kingston won to retain his title. On the May 6, 2010 episode of \"Superstars\", Carlito stopped their match against each other and asked him to work as a team again, thus turning Primo into a heel in the process. On the May 10 episode of \"Raw\", Primo and Carlito brutally attacked R-Truth for Ted DiBiase, who paid them straight after the attack. The team was split up again after Carlito was released from his contract on May 21.\n\nIn September, Primo was one of the WWE Pros for the third season of NXT, with A.J. as his NXT rookie. On the November 23 episode of \"NXT\", A.J. was eliminated from the competition. Primo then mainly featured on Superstars.\n\nOn the November 11, 2011 episode of \"SmackDown\", Primo returned to the brand by accompanying Hunico and his real-life cousin Epico to the ring for their tag team match against The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso). Primo then began teaming with Epico, with Rosa Mendes as their manager, where they defeated The Usos on the November 17 episode of \"Superstars\". They began a feud with WWE Tag Team Champions Air Boom (Evan Bourne and Kofi Kingston), trading victories. At , Primo and Epico failed to capture the WWE Tag Team Championships from Air Boom. The feud continued in singles and non-title matches, with both teams trading wins. At a live event on January 15, 2012, Primo and Epico defeated Air Boom to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. The following night on \"Raw\", Primo and Epico successfully defended their titles against Air Boom in a rematch. On the February 27 episode of \"Raw\", Primo and Epico successfully defended their titles in a Triple Threat tag team match against the teams of Kofi Kingston and R-Truth, and Dolph Ziggler and Jack Swagger. In the pre-show of WrestleMania XXVIII, Primo and Epico successfully defended the title against The Usos, and Justin Gabriel and Tyson Kidd in a triple threat tag team match. On the April 30 episode of \"Raw\", Primo and Epico lost the tag team titles to Kofi Kingston and R-Truth.\n\nIn May, Primo and Epico joined A.W.'s talent agency. At No Way Out, A.W. turned on them during their number one contender Fatal Four-Way tag team match, aligned with The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil). The following night on \"Raw\", Primo and Epico defeated The Prime Time Players by count-out after Young and O'Neil walked out of the match. The feud continued on \"Superstars\", where Epico lost to Young and Primo beat O'Neil in singles matches. At Money in the Bank, Primo and Epico defeated Young and O'Neil. The feud ended in August when A.W. was released from WWE. At Survivor Series, Primo took part in a 10–man elimination tag team match, but was eliminated by Rey Mysterio. Primo and Epico could not find any wins after August 2012, and by the first \"SmackDown\" of 2013, Primo was on a 20 match losing streak, and Epico was at 17. On the January 9, 2013 episode of \"NXT\", Primo and Epico broke their losing streaks with a win over Bo Dallas and Michael McGillicutty. However, Dallas and McGillicutty gained revenge by defeating Primo and Epico in the first round of the NXT Tag Team Championship tournament.\nOn the August 19, 2013 episode of Raw, a vignette was aired introducing the debut of Los Matadores, and on the September 30 episode of \"Raw\", Primo and Epico debuted new characters, as Diego and Fernando of Los Matadores, a face team of two masked Spanish bullfighters with El Torito as mascot as they defeated 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre and Jinder Mahal. It was the start of a winning streak that featured nine wins over 3MB, (with El Torito wrestling in some matches), and also over The Real Americans (Antonio Cesaro and Jack Swagger) at Hell in a Cell. Los Matadores' winning streak was snapped on the January 24, 2014 episode of \"SmackDown\", courtesy of RybAxel (Ryback and Curtis Axel). On the WrestleMania XXX pre-show, Los Matadores received a WWE Tag Team Championship shot against The Usos, RybAxel and The Real Americans, in a Fatal Four-Way tag team elimination match, but lost after eliminated by The Real Americans. At Battleground, Diego competed in a battle royal for the vacant Intercontinental Championship, but was eliminated by Ryback. On March 29, 2015, at the WrestleMania 31 pre-show, Los Matadores were in a Fatal 4-way match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but failed to win the titles. Diego participated in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal but was eliminated by Kane. After months of chasing the WWE Tag Team Championship, Los Matadores fell out and seemingly broke up, as they no longer appeared on TV.\nFrom April 4 to May 9, 2016, several videos aired on \"Raw\" promoted the return of Primo and Epico, who revived their Puerto Rican gimmick under the new name The Shining Stars. On the May 16 episode of \"Raw\", The Shining Stars debuted by defeating a local tag team Scott Jackson and Brian Kennedy in a squash match. They then began showing tendencies of con men, trying to persuade various superstars to purchase timeshares to their Puerto Rican resort. This led to a feud with The Golden Truth (Goldust and R-Truth) On the November 7 episode of \"Raw\", after R-Truth sold his team's Survivor Series spot for a stay at a timeshare to The Shining Stars, both teams competed to qualify for the 10–on–10 Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match, which Primo and Epico won. At the event, Team Raw defeated Team SmackDown. At WrestleMania 33, Primo participated in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal but was eliminated by Braun Strowman.\n\nOn April 11, 2017, they were traded to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2017 Superstar Shake-up when they attacked American Alpha (Chad Gable and Jason Jordan). The following week on \"SmackDown Live\", the team were officially renamed The Colóns, after defeating American Alpha. In June, Colón suffered a knee injury. After a long hiatus, Colón returned on the April 3, 2018 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", teaming with Baron Corbin, Dolph Ziggler and Mojo Rawley in a winning effort against Breezango (Tyler Breeze and Fandango), Tye Dillinger and Zack Ryder. At WrestleMania 34, Colón participated in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which he failed to win. Following this, the team rarely appeared on TV or at live events, virtually disappearing. On December 10, 2019, Colón was suspended for 30 days, for violating of WWE's Wellness Policy. Primo claimed that he didn't fail the test and was suspended due to missing the test, as he was in Puerto Rico at the time and stated that he plans to appeal the decision. On April 15, 2020, Primo was released from his WWE contract due to the budget cuts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, ending his 13-year tenure with the company.\n\nWhile still part of WWE’s roster (yet inactive), The Colóns returned to WWC, working in both administrative roles and as in-ring talent in 2019. By the summer, Epico was harassed by a wrestler sporting his former mantle of La Pesadilla, but this did not prevent him from earning his first reign as Universal Heavyweight Champion. Afterwards, a storyline began where both Primo and Carlito began pursuing the title. In the first intrafamiliar match, Colón failed to capture the title at Septiembre Negro. At Noche de Campeones, all three cousins wrestled each other for the first time in their careers. Epico retained, but Colón turned on the family and rebranded himself Eddie “La Maravilla” Colón, forming a faction known as The Dynasty along Gilbert and Peter John Ramos. The three then began a campaign to dethrone the champion. In the process, Colón was faced with the new allies of his cousin, losing to a returning Apollo (part of the “Dream Team”, along Ricky Banderas) when the rest of The Dynasty intervened.\n\nColón made his video game debut in \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010\" and has appeared in \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011\", \"WWE '13\", \"WWE 2K18\" and \"WWE 2K19\" as Primo and in \"WWE 2K16\" (as DLC) and \"WWE 2K17\" as Diego.\n\nColón is the son of retired wrestler Carlos Colón Sr. and the third youngest of four siblings, including Carly Colón and Stacy Colón, both of whom have performed in the World Wrestling Council. A second sister, Melissa did not enter the wrestling business. Other members of Colón's family have also been involved in the World Wrestling Council, including his uncle José Colón and cousin Orlando Colón, who have been involved in several angles within the company.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1862297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862297", "title": "Maiolica", "text": "Maiolica\n\nMaiolica is tin-glazed pottery decorated in colours on a white background. Italian maiolica dating from the Renaissance period is the most renowned. When depicting historical and mythical scenes, these works were known as \"istoriato\" wares (\"painted with stories\"). By the late 15th century, several places, mainly small cities in northern and central Italy, were producing sophisticated pieces for a luxury market in Italy and beyond. In France maiolica developed as faience, in the Netherlands and England as delftware, and in Mexico as talavera. \nIn English the spelling was anglicised to \"majolica\" but the pronunciation remained usually the same with the long \"i\" as in \"kite\".\n\nThe name is thought to come from the medieval Italian word for Majorca, an island on the route for ships bringing Hispano-Moresque wares from Valencia to Italy. Moorish potters from Majorca are reputed to have worked in Sicily and it has been suggested that their wares reached the Italian mainland from Caltagirone. An alternative explanation of the name is that it comes from the Spanish term \"obra de Malaga\", denoting “[imported] wares from Malaga”, or \"obra de mélequa\", the Spanish name for lustre.\n\nIn the 15th century, the term \"maiolica\" referred solely to lusterware, including both Italian-made and Spanish imports, and tin-glaze wares were known as \"bianchi\" (white ware). By 1875 the term was in use describing ceramics made in Italy, lustred or not, of tin-glazed earthenware. \nWith the Spanish conquest of Mexico, tin-glazed maiolica wares came to be produced in the Valley of Mexico as early as 1540, at first in imitation of tin-glazed pottery imported from Seville. Mexican maiolica is known famously as 'Talavera'.\n\n\"By a convenient extension and limitation the name may be applied to all tin-glazed ware, of whatever nationality, made in the Italian tradition ... the name faïence (or the synonymous English 'delftware') being reserved for the later wares of the 17th Century onwards, either in original styles (as in the case of the French) or, more frequently, in the Dutch-Chinese (Delft) tradition.\" The term \"maiolica\" is sometimes applied to modern tin-glazed ware made by studio potters.\n\nTin glazing creates a white, opaque surface for painting. The colours are applied as metallic oxides or as fritted underglazes to the unfired glaze, which absorbs pigment like fresco, making errors impossible to fix, but preserving the brilliant colors. Sometimes the surface is covered with a second glaze (called \"coperta\" by the Italians) that lends greater shine and brilliance to the wares. In the case of lustred wares, a further oxygen-starved firing at a lower temperature is required. Kilns required wood as well as suitable clay. Glaze was made from sand, wine lees, lead compounds and tin compounds. Tin-glazed earthenware is frequently prone to flaking and somewhat delicate.\n\nAnalysis of samples of Italian maiolica pottery from the Middle Ages has indicated that tin was not always a component of the glaze, whose chemical composition varied.\n\nThe fifteenth-century wares that initiated maiolica as an art form were the product of an evolution in which medieval lead-glazed earthenwares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily. Such archaic wares are sometimes called \"proto-maiolica\". During the later fourteenth century, the limited palette of colours for earthenware decorated with coloured lead glazes (no added tin oxide) was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to include cobalt blue, antimony yellow and iron-oxide orange. \"Sgraffito\" wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide glaze was scratched through to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware. Scrap sgraffito ware excavated from kilns in Bacchereto, Montelupo and Florence show that such wares were produced more widely than at Perugia and Città di Castello, the places to which they have been traditionally attributed.\n\nRefined production of tin-glazed earthenwares made for more than local needs was concentrated in central Italy from the later thirteenth century, especially in the \"contada\" of Florence. The medium was also adopted by the Della Robbia family of Florentine sculptors. The city itself declined in importance as a centre of maiolica production in the second half of the fifteenth century, perhaps because of local deforestation, and manufacture was scattered among small communes, and, after the mid-fifteenth century, at Faenza.\n\nPotters from Montelupo set up the potteries at Cafaggiolo. In 1490, twenty-three master-potters of Montelupo agreed to sell the year's production to Francesco Antinori of Florence; Montelupo provided the experienced potters who were set up in 1495 at the Villa Medicea di Cafaggiolo by its Medici owners.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, Florentine wares spurred the production of maiolica at Arezzo and Siena. \nItalian maiolica reached an astonishing degree of perfection in this period. In Romagna, Faenza, which gave its name to faience, produced fine maiolica from the early fifteenth century; it was the only significant city in which ceramic production industry became a major part of the economy. Bologna produced lead-glazed wares for export. Orvieto and Deruta both produced \"maioliche\" in the fifteenth century.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, maiolica production was established at Castel Durante, Urbino, Gubbio and Pesaro. The early sixteenth century saw the development of \"istoriato\" wares on which historical and mythical scenes were painted in great detail. The State Museum of Medieval and Modern Art] in Arezzo claims to have the largest collection of \"istoriato\" wares in Italy. \"Istoriato\" wares are also well represented in the British Museum, London.\n\nSome maiolica was produced as far north as Padua, Venice and Turin and as far south as Palermo and Caltagirone in Sicily and Laterza in Apulia. In the seventeenth century Savona began to be a prominent place of manufacture.\n\nThe variety of styles that arose in the sixteenth century all but defies classification. Goldthwaite notes that Paride Berardi's morphology of Pesaro maioliche comprises four styles in 20 sub-groups; Tiziano Mannoni categorized Ligurian wares in four types, eight sub-categories and 36 further divisions; Galeazzo Cora's morphology of Montelupo's production is in 19 groups and 51 categories. The diversity of styles can best be seen in a comparative study of apothecary jars produced between the 15th and 18th centuries. Italian cities encouraged the pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, monopoly rights and protection from outside imports.\n\nAn important mid-sixteenth century document for the techniques of maiolica painting is the treatise of Cipriano Piccolpasso. The work of individual sixteenth-century masters like Nicola da Urbino, Francesco Xanto Avelli, Guido Durantino and Orazio Fontana of Urbino, Mastro Giorgio of Gubbio and Maestro Domenigo of Venice has been noted. Gubbio lustre used colours such as greenish yellow, strawberry pink and a ruby red.\n\nThe tradition of fine maiolica came under increasing competition in the 18th century, mainly from porcelain and white earthenware. But the 18th century is not a period of relentless decline. To face the competition from porcelain and its vibrant colours, the process of third firing (piccolo fuoco) was introduced, initially in North-West Europe around the mid of century. After the traditional two firings at 950°C, the vitrified glaze was painted with colours that would have degraded at such high temperatures, and was fired a third time at a lower temperature, about 600-650°C. New vibrant colours were thus introduced, in particular red and various shades of pink obtained from gold chloride. It is believed that one of the first to introduce this technique in Italy was Ferretti in Lodi, in northern Italy. Lodi maiolica had already reached high quality in the second quarter of the 18th century. With the introduction of the third firing technique, and with the increasing interest in botany and scientific observation, a refined production of maiolica decorated with naturalistic flowers was developed.\n\nItalian maiolica remains commonly produced in many centres, both in folk art forms and reproductions of the historic style. Some of the principal centers of production (e.g. Deruta and Montelupo) still produce maiolica, which is sold worldwide. Modern maiolica looks different from old maiolica because its glaze is usually opacified with the cheaper zircon rather than tin, though there are potteries that specialise in making authentic-looking Renaissance-style pieces with genuine tin-glaze.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1862320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862320", "title": "Lim Guan Eng", "text": "Lim Guan Eng\n\nLim Guan Eng (; born 8 December 1960) is a Malaysian politician from the Democratic Action Party (DAP) currently serving as three-term Member of Parliament (MP) and three-term assemblyman (MLA) representing Bagan and Air Putih respectively. Being the Secretary-General of DAP since 2004, he also served as the Chief Minister of Penang between 2008 and 2018 and Minister of Finance between 2018 and 2020.\n\nLim is the son of Lim Kit Siang, Leader of the Opposition in the Malaysian House of Representatives from 1973 to 1999 and 2004 to 2008. He is married to Betty Chew Gek Cheng (周玉清), who was former two-term MLA for Kota Laksamana in Malacca. She is the first serving assemblywoman to be married to a Chief Minister. They have four children.\n\nLim Guan Eng attended La Salle Primary English School in Petaling Jaya, and later the Batu Pahat Montfort Primary English School. For his secondary education, he attended Batu Pahat High School and Malacca High School. He graduated from Monash University in Australia with a Bachelor of Economics (BEc). He also served as the president of MUISS (Monash University International Student Society) during his university years.\n\nPrior to his political career, Lim was a senior executive at a bank. He was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Kota Melaka in 1986, defeating Soh Chin Aun with a majority of 17,606 votes. He was re-elected in the 1990 and 1995 general elections, albeit with reduced majorities. He thus became the first person to be elected to three consecutive terms in Kota Melaka. He was also the first Malacca High School alumnus to achieve this.\n\nIn October 1987, he was detained under the Internal Security Act in Operation Lalang, along with 106 other politicians and activists. He was released in April 1989. He was the first person to be detained and the last to be released during Operation Lalang.\n\nHe was appointed the DAP Socialist Youth chairman in 1989 and was formally elected to that post in 1992. In 1995, he was elected the DAP Deputy Secretary-General. He was elected the party's Secretary-General in 2004, and has held that position since.\n\nLim was arrested by the Malaysian police in 1994, following his criticism of the government's failure to bring the then-Chief Minister of Melaka, Tan Sri Abdul Rahim Thamby Chik's statutory rape case to trial when the Attorney General had decided not to press charges. Lim was charged under Section 4(1) (b) of the Sedition Act 1948 for causing 'disaffection with the administration of justice in Malaysia'. He was also charged under Section 8A (1) of the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984 for 'maliciously printing' a pamphlet containing allegedly 'false information' which supposedly described the alleged rape victim as an 'imprisoned victim' because she was initially detained by Malaysian police without parental consent for 10 days. During the judicial procedure, Lim was quoted as saying:\n\nAfter a series of appeals, Lim was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. He was, however, released after 12 months on 25 August 1999. Due to his incarceration, he was barred from standing for election to public office for a period of 5 years, and he was therefore ineligible to contest in the 2004 Malaysian General Election.\n\nIn 2005, Lim suffered a surprise defeat in his campaign for re-election to the Malacca DAP committee. However, as Lim remained Secretary-General of the party, he was automatically included in the committee in accordance with the party's constitution. His wife, who had also failed to be elected to the Melaka committee, was not included in the committee even though she remained the chief of the state' s DAP women's wing. Teresa Kok, a DAP MP, suggested that there was a conspiracy behind the Lims' failure to be reelected. Nevertheless, Lim went on to garner the second highest number of votes (620) at the party's 15th National Congress on 23 August 2008.\n\nIn the 2008 Malaysian general election, the DAP-PKR-PAS coalition, later known as Pakatan Rakyat (PR), won 29 out of the 40 state assembly seats contested in Penang, defeating the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. The DAP won 19 seats, PKR 9 seats, and PAS 1. Even though Lim is not a Penangite, he was nominated to be the Chief Minister (CM) of Penang, replacing the former Chief Minister Dr. Koh Tsu Koon of Malaysian People's Movement Party (Gerakan). Other senior DAP leaders of Penang such as Lim Hock Seng, Phee Boon Poh, and Chow Kon Yeow were bypassed and were instead appointed as state executive council members. In the 2013 Malaysian general election, Pakatan Rakyat won a larger majority, gaining 30 out of the 40 state seats in Penang.\n\nWhen he took over as the new Penang CM, Lim announced an amnesty on all summonses issued by the Penang Island City Council and Seberang Perai Municipal Council involving vendors' licences and parking offences issued before March 2008.\n\nOn 14 March 2008, a mob composed mostly of UMNO members and supporters took to the streets illegally after Friday prayers to protest his statements on the NEP. No arrests were made but two men were taken in for questioning. Various BN-backed groups and NGOs continued to protest and lodge police reports as a form of continued harassment.\n\nOn 19 March 2008, Lim announced that the state exco had approved an open tender system for state projects exceeding RM 50,000. For projects between RM20,000 and RM50,000, a balloting system was introduced. A two-week objection period was put in place for both the open tender and balloting systems.\n\nDuring Lim's tenure as CM, Penang maintained its rank as one of the top states for investments in Malaysia. The state attracted RM12.2 billion worth of capital investments in 2010, which accounted for 25% of the total investments in Malaysia. This was a 465% increase on the investment of RM2.17 billion in 2009. In 2011, Penang was the top state in terms of manufacturing investments in Malaysia for the second consecutive year, attracting RM9.1 billion in total. However, using a new measure of total investment that took into account the manufacturing, services and private sectors, Penang ranked second in Malaysia after Sarawak in total investments, with a total amount of RM14.038 billion. This was due to it not having much in terms of primary sector investments.\n\nThe public debt in Penang decreased by 95% from RM630 million in 2008 to RM30 million at the end of 2011. In 2014, Penang recorded a total of RM8.16 billion in investments, which was a 109% increase. Manufacturing investment in Penang increased by 87% to RM53.9 billion in the 2008-2016 period compared to RM24.9 billion in the 2000-2007 period, with a 17% increase in job creation. Foreign investments (FDI) also increased by 62.5% to RM36.7 billion in the 2008-2015 period compared to RM22.6 billion during 2000-2007. Penang currently has the second highest GDP per capita in the country.\n\nPenang's economic growth rate in 2015 was 5.5%, which was higher than Malaysia's growth rate of 5%. Penang has an unemployment rate of 1.5% compared to the national unemployment rate of 3.1%.\n\nOn 28 April 2011, Lim signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China, witnessed by the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, on the proposal to construct three roads and an undersea tunnel on Penang island. The 6.5 km undersea tunnel is to be the third link between the island and Butterworth on the mainland. According to Lim, this would ease traffic congestion in the state and improve the links between the island and the mainland.\n\nOn 25 July 2014, the Penang state government unveiled the RM27 billion Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP) that comprises an integrated transportation network connecting both Penang Island and Seberang Perai. The PTMP aims to achieve a well-defined and fully connected road network and dispersal system as well as a well-integrated and sustainable public transport system, which combines buses, trams, MRT and water taxis. The project was expected to start in 2015 and be completed in 2030.\n\nUnder Lim's tenure, the Penang Island Municipal Council was officially upgraded to city council status on 1 January 2015 by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The state government had been applying to the Malaysian federal government to grant city status since January 2010.\n\nLed by Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng, the Penang state government practised the concept of Competency, Accountability, and Transparency (CAT) in governance. The concept guides the state government in achieving efficient, responsible, and clean governance. It also aims to turn Penang into a cleaner, greener and safer state. The CAT concept encourages positive work ethics and team spirit. It has helped the state government to record budget surpluses and successfully attract RM 12.2 billion in capital investments. According to the international weekly news magazine The Economist, the reform of the state government has ended the cronyism and corruption that led to major deficits under the previous regime.\n\nThe Penang state government under Lim received praise from the Auditor-General as the best financially managed state in Malaysia from 2008 to 2010. According to the AG's report, the consolidated fund increased by 2.7%, from RM 1101.89 million in 2009 to RM 1131.17 million in 2010. Likewise, the consolidated revenue fund has grown by 6.2% from RM 538.95 million in 2009 to RM 572.49 million in 2010. Lim's state government has also won accolades from Transparency International for implementing open tenders in awarding contracts.\n\nThe record budget surpluses were channeled to social welfare programs such as financial aid to the hardcore poor, cash handouts to the elderly, public housing upgrades, free Wi-Fi service at selected hot spots, and free bus services within the city and between Penang island and Seberang Perai for workers. Social welfare aid of RM 100 is awarded annually to senior citizens, single mothers, disabled individuals, new-born babies, and school-going pupils in Primary 1 and 4 as well as Form 1 and 4.\n\nOn 1 March, Lim launched the Bridge Express Shuttle Transit (BEST), which is a free-of-charge park and ride shuttle bus service which ferries commuters across the Penang Bridge from Seberang Jaya to the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone. This bus service aims to increase usage of public transport, which in turn will reduce traffic congestion during peak hours on the Penang Bridge and therefore ease the financial burden of factory workers.\n\nThe SMART Centre Penang is an initiative set up by the Penang state government and the think-tank investPenang during the Penang Outlook Forum in June 2009 chaired by Lim. The SMART Centre intends to provide market intelligence, business advice, information, resources and training services to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Penang. It focuses on the promotion of local sourcing, investments and networking by running various programs such as business matching, seminars and talks.\n\nUnder Pakatan Rakyat's \"Agenda Ekonomi Sosial\" (AES) or Social Economic Agenda, the Penang state government is aiming to be the first state in Malaysia to eradicate poverty by ensuring every household in Penang has an income of at least RM 770 per month. The poverty line is RM 763 per month for every household/family in Peninsular Malaysia. Families with less than RM 770 in monthly income will have the difference topped up by the state government every month.\n\nAside from that, the Penang state government under Lim began to give annual allocations to Chinese independent high schools and also increased annual allocations to Chinese, Tamil and mission schools in Penang which are either not funded or only partially funded by the Education Ministry of Malaysia.\n\nOn 7 June 2014, Lim donated RM 20,000 to the soup kitchen, The Lighthouse, to assist the organisation's efforts in feeding the homeless and poor.\nOn 1 April 2015, the Penang state government under Lim launched the 'Penang Future Foundation (PFF)' scholarship program, which awards scholarships to outstanding young Malaysian students who wish to pursue their undergraduate studies at local private higher educational institutions. Scholarship recipients are required to work in Penang after they graduate. The scholarship program is administered by the Penang state government but is fully funded by the private sector to ensure its sustainability in the long run. This program was launched to attract young talented people to work in the state.\n\nCleaner, Greener Penang is an initiative by the Penang state government launched in 2010 as part of an effort to transform Penang into the most environmentally friendly and liveable city in Malaysia through education, enforcement and appreciation. This is to restore the current living environment into a cleaner and more sustainable city, which in turn will improve the quality of living.\n\nThe Penang state government, led by Lim, enforced the ban on free plastic bags throughout the state on 1 January 2010, despite an initial lukewarm response from retail outlets. Lim said the move would reduce the state's garbage production and carbon footprint. Retail stores, food outlets and hawker stalls statewide are required to adhere to the rulings to ensure renewal of business licences. The proceedings from the sale of plastic bags went to the \"Partners Against Poverty\" Special Fund to assist the state's hardcore poor. This initiative was the first of its kind in Malaysia.\n\nOn 11 December 2011, Lim initiated the Car Free Day which would be held every Sunday at particular stretches of roads in the interior city of George Town, Penang. All motor vehicles are prohibited from entering these areas on that day, which are part of Lim's efforts to transform Penang into a sustainable city and fight climate change. In addition, the state government is also considering a proposal to set up bicycle lanes around Penang island, mainly along coastal areas and Seberang Perai, scheduled to be completed by 2020. The dedicated bicycle lanes in Penang island will cover a coastal route between Penang Second Bridge to Batu Maung and Teluk Bahang. In Seberang Perai, it will cover a 140 km stretch including state and town roads and is subjected to feedback from the public. Lim wanted to promote Penang as the first state to promote cycling as a healthy activity and reduce dependency on motor vehicles.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, the Penang state government implemented a bicycle sharing system in its effort to transform George Town into a greener and more sustainable city. It awarded a RM9.2 million contract to Public Bike Share Sdn. Bhd. to design, install and operate the bicycle sharing system in the city. The system consists of 25 bicycle stations with 1,000 bicycle docks and 500 bicycles throughout George Town. Lim believes that the system will alleviate traffic congestion as well as improve visitors' experience by making places accessible without cars and thus support the state government's initiative in a cleaner, greener, safer and healthier Penang.\n\nOn 6 November 2011, the Penang state government under Lim's leadership managed to strengthen ties and forge friendship with the state of Victoria, Australia when the Governor of Victoria Alex Chernov made an official day-long visit to Penang with the invitation of the state government.\n\nOn 15 November 2011 Penang had hosted an official visit by the Governor General of Canada the Right Honourable David Johnston and the ex-Speaker of the Kanagawa Prefecture of Japan for 2 days. Penang had managed to forge foreign relations with Canada and Japan, which consequently strengthened trade ties to lure foreign investors to Penang. Johnston's first visit to the state was welcomed by Lim and the Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Penang Abdul Rahman Abbas. They walked around the Penang Heritage Trail together with his delegation.\n\nOther foreign delegations who visited Penang include the South Australian Minister of Police and Governor of Bangkok Sukhumbhand Paribatra.\n\nSeveral investment and business delegations have been led by Lim on state visits to Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore, Melbourne, Adelaide, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Lim's official visit to Bangkok also witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Penang and Bangkok, which enabled Penang to be a fast-growing world-class and international city. Prior to this state visit, Penang was looking to develop its tourism by seeking co-operation with Bangkok. Lim said that the state aspires to be achieve global city status by becoming a major economic hub, a top choice for investors, a desirable place for tourists and a habitat of choice for people who want to earn a sustainable living.\n\nIn December 2015, the Penang state government implemented the RM27 billion Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP). It covers various mass transportation systems such as Light Rail Transit (LRT), LRT link between Penang Island and Seberang Perai, monorail, trams, bus transit system (BTS), catamaran (water taxis) across the channel between Penang Island and Seberang Perai, and cable car. Besides that, the master plan also incorporates Pan-Island Link Highway which connects Gurney Drive and Bayan Lepas via Air Itam. Furthermore, the Penang state government plans to reclaim two man-made islands, which is 930ha of land and another 445ha of land off the coast of Permatang Damar Laut south of Penang Island to cover the cost of the project. The transport master plan aims to ease ongoing traffic congestion problems in Penang.\n\nAfter the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition (of which the DAP is part) emerged victorious in the 2018 Malaysian general election and formed the Federal Government, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced Lim Guan Eng's appointment as the Minister of Finance. He succeeded Najib Razak of BN. Lim is the first ethnic-Chinese Malaysian to hold the position since Tan Siew Sin of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) served from 1959 to 1974.\n\nIn September 2018, Lim cancelled two contracts, worth approximately $2.795 billion, with China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau for oil and gas pipelines, stating that some of the funding from the Exim Bank of China had been misappropriated as part of the 1MDB scandal.\n\nLim has announced B40 (Bottom 40 per cent) National Protection Scheme, which is a free national health insurance scheme for the low income starting from 1 January 2019 at an initial cost of RM2 billion. The insurance scheme will improve access to health coverage and ease the burden of the low income families.\n\nBesides that, Lim under the Finance Ministry has announced that first-time home buyers will be fully exempted from stamp duty for properties up to RM1 million starting from 1 January 2019.\n\nOn 14 December 2011, Lim won a second defamation suit against Malay daily Utusan Malaysia, which was ordered by the Penang High Court to pay a total of RM200,000 worth of damages and a cost of RM25,000 to him. Utusan Malaysia had allegedly published a defamatory news article about Lim entitled \"Kebiadapan Guan Eng\" (Guan Eng's Arrogance) which had defamed his political career, and subsequently pictured him and DAP as anti-Malay and anti-Muslim.\n\nOn 22 June 2012, Lim won a defamation suit against Utusan Malaysia, which was ordered by High Court to pay a total of RM200,000 worth of damages and RM20,000 in costs to the former. The Malay daily had been found guilty by the court of defaming Lim in a published news article headlined \"Tiada Lagi DEB\" (No More NEP), which said that Lim would abolish the New Economic Policy.\n\nOn 30 January 2015, he, with two news portals, Malaysiakini and The Malaysian Insider were sued by Penang UMNO secretary, Datuk Musa Sheikh Fadzir, Maison Height Sdn Bhd and Penang Barisan Nasional secretary Datuk Omar Faudzar for making defamatory article on the alleged sale of Malay lands for profit. In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs referred to an article written by Lim titled \"Pembohongan Umno\" (Umno's lies), which was published in The Malaysian Insider on 27 Nov 2014, and another article titled \"Stop spreading lies about Penang government, Guan Eng tells Umno\" which was also published in the same news portal on 27 Nov.The plaintiffs stated that Lim, Mkini and Gan had caused the publication of another article \"Umno made profits by selling Malay Kampungs\", containing defamatory words in Malaysiakini.\nThe plaintiffs filed a notice of discontinuance on 1 April 2016.\n\nOn 26 March 2015, Lim won a defamation suit against Perkasa, New Straits Times and Utusan Malaysia concerning an article over a dinner which Lim attended in Singapore in 2011. The latter were ordered by the High Court to pay RM550,000 in damages. Justice Nor Bee Ariffin ordered Perkasa chief Datuk Ibrahim Ali, information chief Ruslan Kassim and Perkasa to pay RM150,000; New Straits Times former group editor Datuk Syed Nazri Syed Harun and NSTP RM200,000 and Utusan Melayu group editor-in-chief Datuk Abdul Aziz Ishak and Utusan Melayu RM200,000. Justice Nor Bee Ariffin said that Syed Nazri, NSTP, Abdul Aziz and Utusan Melayu failed to practice responsible journalism.\n\nOn 3 July 2015, he lost a lawsuit brought by the state opposition leader, Datuk Jahara Hamid. Lim had allegedly called Datuk Jahara a \"racist grandmother\" in December 2013. Lim was ordered to pay RM 500,000 in damages at 5% interest per annum and RM 40,000 in legal costs. He was also ordered to retract the statement. The judicial commissioner said that he had been unprofessional (as a chief minister) to resort to name calling an opposition leader and had brought disrepute to both the state assembly and the office of Chief Minister. His sexist statement was also condemned by the chairperson of the women's wing of the DAP, Chong Eng; Zuraida Kamaruddin, chairperson of the women's wing of Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR); and several female Senators.\n\nIn August 2017, Lim filed a suit against New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Bhd (NSTP) for running an article titled \"Political Intervention was real, says PAS\", which accused him of interfering in Islamic affairs. On 2 November 2018, the High Court ordered NSTP to pay damages of RM200,000 to Lim and directed NSTP to publish an unconditional and unreserved apology admitting that the article was defamatory to him.\n\nOn 19 September 2018, a consent judgment was reached before the High Court with the publisher of the New Straits Times and Berita Harian newspapers agreeing to publish an apology and pay Lim RM130,000 in damages over three defamatory articles published in January 2018, quoting Teng Chang Yeow who accused Lim of lying about Penang government’s payments to the contractors of the undersea tunnel and three main roads project.\n\nIn 2012, Penang state UMNO Youth Chief accused the Penang state government of breaking the law in selling the Bayan Mutiara land to developer Ivory Property Group Berhad without subdividing the land. He also claimed that the state government sold the land without open tender and made no provision for mosques. However, Lim Guan Eng showed evidence that it has been sold via open tender and thus explained that the developer would only do the subdividing when it submits development plans for the 41.5-ha real estate project to the Penang Municipal Council. The developer had clarified that land for the mosque and school has been allocated and adhered to the town planning regulation after the new plans and subdivision of title has been submitted.\n\nIn 2013, his official trip to Xiamen and Hainan in China with a delegation including his wife were criticised by Penang MCA for practicing double standard in his stand for bringing spouse in official trip. Penang MCA Secretary, Lau Chiek Tan said \"Previously, Lim had criticised Barisan Nasional leaders for wasting public funds by bringing their families with them on official trips. We now see Pakatan Rakyat leaders doing the same with this trip to China.\"\n\nIn 2014, he was criticized for swapping his two-month-old Toyota Camry official car for a new Mercedes-Benz S300L. Netizens and NGOs commented that he did not practise what he preached because in 2008 he had condemned the Terengganu State Government for buying a fleet of Mercedes-Benz cars as its official cars. The Barisan Nasional MP for Kota Belud, Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan, accused Lim of being \"hypocritical\". Lim defended his decision, saying that he had bought the car at a discounted price.\n\nOn 20 September 2011, Lim Guan Eng participated in an interview conducted by Australian Broadcasting Corporation where he was reported by the Malaysian news agency, Bernama, to have disparaged the security of the state of Johor. Lim Guan Eng insisted he never mentioned Johor, and demanded that Bernama retract their story and issue a formal apology, or face a lawsuit. However, a recording was later revealed by TV3, showing clear evidence of Lim Guan Eng proclaiming that Singaporeans who are in Johor are \"likely to be kidnapped\". The recording of Lim Guan Eng's remark was made in Singapore. This led Lim Guan Eng to issue a formal apology to the Sultan of Johor.\n\nLim was involved in a controversy regarding the establishment of the Penang Voluntary Patrol Unit (PPS) which was declared illegal by Ministry of Home Affairs. He however, declared it a legal entity and challenged Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar, who was then Malaysia's Inspector-general of police to a debate on the legitimacy of the PPS. He then challenged the Home Ministry's declaration in court. His case however, was thrown out of court by the High Court. However, on 28 March 2017, the Court of Appeal ruled that the Penang Voluntary Patrol Unit (PPS) is a legal organisation established by the Penang state government.\n\n\n\n"}

She was a companion of the Fourth Doctor. \nSharon was introduced in \"Doctor Who and the Star Beast\", which ran in issues #19-#26 of \"Doctor Who Weekly\" (as it then was), written by Pat Mills and John Wagner, and drawn by Dave Gibbons. She was a secondary school student living in the city of Blackcastle, England. She was the first non-white companion, albeit not on television.\n\nOne night, a spacecraft crash-landed in Blackcastle, bringing with it the intergalactic tyrant Beep the Meep. The Meep was fleeing the galactic law enforcers called the Wrarth, but he used his appearance as a cute, furry alien to gain Sharon's sympathy. Sharon sheltered Beep for a time, and it was while doing this that she met the Doctor. Beep's ruse was eventually uncovered and he was handed over to the Wrarth, and the Doctor prepared to take Sharon back to Earth.\n\nHowever, at this time the TARDIS was being particularly unreliable, so the Doctor and Sharon shared several adventures on the way. Together with the Doctor, Sharon faced the Daleks, the Sontarans and Brimo the Time Witch, among others. During the encounter with Brimo, a fault in the TARDIS's chrono-compensator made everyone in the time machine age four years in an instant while passing through a time rift. While this did not affect the Doctor significantly, Sharon was suddenly in her early twenties. Not having been fond of being an adolescent, however, she was quite pleased with the results.\n\nEventually, Sharon and the Doctor arrived on the planet Unicepter IV. Since the Doctor's last visit, a new fad of dreaming had arisen, with professional dreamers who would construct dream worlds in which groups of people could participate in a shared fantasy. This was facilitated by the Slinth, telepathic sloth-like creatures that perched on the dreamers' shoulders and made it possible to connect multiple minds to a single dreamer. It transpired, however, that the Slinth were actually psychic vampires, and had been leeching energy off the minds of the dreamers until they were strong enough to mass for an attack. During these events, Sharon met a dreamer named Vernor, and after the Doctor defeated the Slinth, she chose to remain behind on Unicepter IV to be with him.\n\nThe Doctor did intend to return to Unicepter IV to attend her wedding but ended up landing in Blackcastle instead, where he once again encountered Beep the Meep (\"The Star Beast II\", \"Doctor Who Magazine Yearbook 1996\"). An image of Sharon constructed by the TARDIS to help destroy a Vortex parasite appeared in the Eighth Doctor comic strip \"A Life of Matter and Death\" (\"DWM\" #250).\n\nSharon returned, now in middle age and working as a television reporter, to help the Twelfth Doctor in \"The Stockbridge Showdown\" (\"DWM\" #500), along with other companions of the Doctor created for the magazine, such as Frobisher, Izzy and Destrii.\n\nIn the comic book \"Incomplete Death's Head\" #5, as part of the profile on \"Doctor Who\", her name was given as Sharon Davies. The accuracy of this information is not known.\n\nSharon is due to make her audio debut in a Big Finish adaptation of her first story \"Doctor Who and the Star Beast\", opposite Tom Baker as the Doctor, in March 2019. She will be played by actress Rhianne Starbuck.\n\n"}
{"id": "1862328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862328", "title": "Powder Alarm", "text": "Powder Alarm\n\nThe Powder Alarm was a major popular reaction to the removal of gunpowder from a magazine by British soldiers under orders from General Thomas Gage, royal governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, on September 1, 1774. In response to this action, amid rumors that blood had been shed, alarm spread through the countryside to Connecticut and beyond, and American Patriots sprang into action, fearing that war was at hand. Thousands of militiamen began streaming toward Boston and Cambridge, and mob action forced Loyalists and some government officials to flee to the protection of the British Army.\n\nAlthough it proved to be a false alarm, the Powder Alarm caused political and military leaders to proceed more carefully in the days ahead, and essentially provided a \"dress rehearsal\" for the Battles of Lexington and Concord seven and a half months later. Furthermore, actions on both sides to control weaponry, gunpowder, and other military supplies became more contentious, as the British sought to bring military stores more directly under their control, and the Patriot colonists sought to acquire them for their own use.\n\nIn 1772, many of the thirteen British colonies, in response to unpopular British actions and the negative British reaction to the \"Gaspee\" Affair (the destruction by colonists of a grounded ship involved in enforcing customs regulations), elected to form Committees of Correspondence. These allowed communities to formally communicate with each other, raise awareness of incidents occurring elsewhere, and to coordinate actions; as such, they became instrumental in managing the colonial response to enforcement of the Tea Act, the Intolerable Acts, and other unpopular British colonial legislation. The colonists of Massachusetts had not yet taken concerted action to organize themselves militarily against actions of the British regulars, although statements were made about supporting Boston (whose port had been closed earlier in 1774 under the Boston Port Act) \"at the risque of our lives and fortunes.\"\n\nGeneral Thomas Gage, who had become the military governor of Massachusetts in May 1774, was charged with enforcement of the highly unpopular Intolerable Acts, which British Parliament had passed in response to the Boston Tea Party. Seeking to prevent the outbreak of war and to keep the peace between the American Patriot (Whig) majority and the Loyalist (Tory) minority, he believed that the best way to accomplish this was by secretly removing military stores from storehouses and arsenals in New England. The secrecy of these missions was paramount, as Gage feared that leakage of any plans would result in the seizure or concealment of the stores by Patriot sympathizers before his men got there.\n\nThere were several places throughout the colonies where the British army had stockpiled supplies. Some of these places were fortifications that were manned by small garrisons; others were merely locked magazines. Most of the powder in these was under the control of the provincial government, though some was the property of individual towns. One locked storehouse near Boston, in what was then part of Charlestown, now Powder House Square in Somerville, was controlled by William Brattle, the leader of the provincial militia and an appointee of the governor. Brattle, who had not obviously sided with either Loyalists or Patriots, notified Governor Gage in a letter dated August 27 that the provincial (\"King's\") powder was the only supply remaining in that storehouse, as the towns had removed all of theirs. Gage decided that this powder had to be brought to Boston for safekeeping.\n\nOn August 31, Gage sent Middlesex County sheriff David Phips to Brattle with orders to remove the provincial powder; Brattle turned the key to the powderhouse over to Phips. Gage also gave orders to ready a force of troops for action the next day, something that did not go unnoticed by the local population. At some point that day, General Gage, whether by his intent, accident, or theft by a messenger, lost possession of William Brattle's letter; the widely held story is that it was dropped. News of its content spread rapidly, and many considered it to be a warning to Gage to remove the provincial powder before Patriots could seize it.\n\nEarly in the morning of September 1, a force of roughly 260 British regulars from the 4th Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Maddison, were rowed in secrecy up the Mystic River from Boston to a landing point near Winter Hill in modern-day Somerville. From there they marched about a mile to the Powder House, a gunpowder magazine that held the largest supply of gunpowder in Massachusetts. Phips gave the King's Troops the keys to the building, and after sunrise they removed all of the gunpowder. Most of the regulars then returned to Boston the way they had come, but a small contingent marched to Cambridge, removed two field pieces, and took them to Boston by foot over the Great Bridge and up Boston Neck. The field pieces and powder were then taken from Boston to the British stronghold on Castle Island, then known as Castle William (renamed Fort Independence in 1779).\n\nRumors flew throughout the day across the countryside about the British troop movements. The regulars were marching; provincial powder had been seized; war was at hand; people had been killed; Boston was being bombarded by His Majesty's warships. The alarm spread as far as Connecticut. From all over the region, people took up arms and began streaming toward Boston. One traveler in Shrewsbury reported that in the space of 15 minutes, 50 men had gathered, equipped themselves, sent out messengers to surrounding towns, and left for Boston. On the 2nd, several thousand men bent on violence gathered in Cambridge, where they forced several notable Loyalists, including William Brattle, to flee to Boston and the protection of the military. Sheriff Phips was forced, in writing, to dissociate himself from any and all government actions. Eventually facts caught up with the rumors, and militia units (some of which were still heading toward Boston) returned home.\n\nAlso on the 2nd, Boston newspapers published a letter from William Brattle in which he protested that he had not warned Gage to remove the powder; Gage had requested from him an accounting of the storehouse's contents, and he had complied. The content of his letter to Gage would be published on the 5th. Brattle remained on Castle Island through the siege of Boston, leaving when the British evacuated the city in March 1776. He died in Halifax, Nova Scotia in October 1776 at the age of 70.\n\nGage, surprised by the size and scope of the colonial reaction, delayed and eventually cancelled a second planned expedition to the storehouse in Worcester. He concentrated his troops in Boston, and called for reinforcements from London, writing \"if you think ten thousand men sufficient, send twenty; if one million is thought enough, give two; you save both blood and treasure in the end.\" However, Gage's request was seen by some in London as absurd, as there were only 12,000 troops in Britain at the time, but he did eventually receive an additional 400 Marines in response to these requests. He later began planning and executing seizures again, and he further fortified the Boston peninsula.\n\nAfter the Powder Alarm, militia forces throughout New England were more cautious with their supplies and more intent on gaining information about Gage's plans and troop movements. Paul Revere played a significant role in distributing this information because of his geographical position in Boston, his social position as a middle-class craftsman in contact with all social classes, and his political position as a well-known Patriot propagandist and organizer.\n\nOn September 21, 1774, Patriot leaders met in Worcester and urged town meetings to organize a third of the militias into special companies of minutemen in constant readiness to march. They also instituted the system of express riders and alarms that would prove to be critical at Lexington and Concord. In October, the former legislature of Massachusetts met in defiance of the Massachusetts Government Act and declared itself to be the First Provincial Congress. It created a Committee of Safety modeled after a body with the same name during the English Civil War and it recommended that a quarter of the militia be designated as minutemen. Military stores were to be stockpiled away from the coast (more than a convenient day's march), to make attempts to seize them more difficult. The largest stockpiles were located at Concord and Worcester.\n\nEarly in December, British military command voted to prohibit the export of arms and powder to North America, and to secure all remaining stores. On December 12, intelligence received by Paul Revere indicated that a seizure of stores at Fort William and Mary in Portsmouth, New Hampshire was imminent. He rode from Boston to Portsmouth the next day to notify the local Patriots, who quickly raided the fort on the 14th and removed its supplies. Revere's intelligence had been incorrect; although a British operation had been contemplated, it had not been ordered. The British did send ships carrying troops to Portsmouth, and they arrived three days after the fort's supplies were removed. The first arrived on the 17th, and was directed into shallows at high tide by a local Patriot pilot, much to the captain's anger.\n\nStores of gunpowder—typically referred to by Loyalists as \"the King's powder\" but in contrast by Patriots as \"the militia's powder\"—were also carried off from forts in Newport, Rhode Island, Providence, Rhode Island, and New London, Connecticut, and distributed to the militias in towns away from the coast. Cannon and other supplies were smuggled out of Boston and Charlestown.\n\nOn February 27, 1775, HMS \"Lively\" brought a force of about 240 British regulars from the 64th Regiment under Colonel Alexander Leslie to confiscate weapons in Salem, Massachusetts. They were stopped by a small crowd that raised a drawbridge in their path and taunted them while others moved the cannon to safety and sent for help from nearby towns. Eventually, the drawbridge was lowered and the regulars were permitted to search the forge where the cannon had once been. They returned to their ship while being mocked by a growing force of irregulars marching along in lock-step next to them. There were minor scuffles, but no shots were fired.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1862337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862337", "title": "Jermain Taylor", "text": "Jermain Taylor\n\nJermain Taylor (born August 11, 1978) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 2001 to 2014. He remains the most recent undisputed middleweight champion, having won the WBA (Undisputed), WBC, IBF, WBO, \"Ring\" magazine, and lineal titles in 2005 by beating Bernard Hopkins, and in doing so ending Hopkins' twelve-year reign as middleweight champion. This made Taylor the first, and to date, only boxer in history to claim each title from all four major boxing sanctioning organizations in a single fight. He would also later hold the IBF middleweight title for a second time.\n\nTaylor made his professional debut in 2001 and won his first 25 bouts, which included victories over former champions Raúl Márquez and William Joppy. Taylor, who began boxing officially at age 13, earned numerous accolades throughout his amateur career, starting with his achievement of the 1996 Under-19 Championship. He went on to win a pair of Police Athletic League (PAL) Championships and National Golden Gloves titles and he finished second and third at the 1997 and 1998 United States Championships, respectively. In 1998, Taylor won a bronze medal at the Goodwill Games. Then, in 2000, he earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic boxing team, becoming the first ever boxer from Arkansas to compete in the Olympic Games. At the 2000 Olympics, Taylor won a bronze medal in the light middleweight division.\n\nDuring his reign as unified middleweight champion, Taylor won an immediate rematch against Hopkins and defeated Kassim Ouma and Cory Spinks, as well as fighting Winky Wright to a draw. Having vacated the WBC and IBF titles, he lost the remainder of the unified and lineal middleweight championship to Kelly Pavlik in 2007, in what was his first professional defeat. A move up to super middleweight for a rematch against Pavlik the following year was also unsuccessful. In 2009, Taylor challenged Carl Froch for the WBC super middleweight title, but was stopped with seconds remaining in the final round. At the end of the year he participated in the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament, but was again knocked out in the closing seconds of the final round by Arthur Abraham.\n\nSubsequent neurological issues would force Taylor out of the ring for the next two years. He returned in 2011, winning five consecutive fights and defeating Sam Soliman in 2014 to claim his second IBF middleweight title. Later that year, Taylor was arrested and detained on gun charges but would avoid a prison sentence in 2016.\n\nIn December 2000, Taylor signed with boxing promoter Lou DiBella. Pat Burns became Taylor's trainer as a professional and Ozell Nelson became an assistant. He made his professional boxing debut on January 27, 2001, at Madison Square Garden in New York City against Chris Walsh. Taylor managed to knock Walsh down twice with his right hand and won his debut after forcing a stoppage with 16 seconds left in the fourth and final round. He went on to fight six more times in 2001, resulting in six more victories. Taylor continued his winning streak through 2002 and 2003, before defeating Alex Bunema on March 27, 2004. Taylor's next bout occurred on June 19, 2004 against former IBF Light Middleweight Champion Raúl Márquez. Taylor controlled the fight by using his jab and right hand throughout the one-sided contest. Near the end of the ninth round, Taylor landed a right uppercut that staggered Márquez. A follow-up right hand put Márquez down just before the bell rung to end the round. Soon after Márquez arrived to his corner, his trainer told the referee to stop the fight, resulting in a technical knockout victory for Taylor. On December 4, 2004, Taylor fought former WBA Middleweight Champion William Joppy in his hometown of Little Rock. For the majority of the fight, Joppy made the more aggressive Taylor chase him, while landing few punches and seeming more content to frustrate Taylor. Taylor landed several punches early in the fight and knocked Joppy down in the fifth round en route to a unanimous decision victory with scores of 120–107 from all three judges. In his next bout, Taylor fought Daniel Edouard on February 19, 2005. In the third round, Taylor landed a 10-punch combination that hurt Edouard to the point that the referee decided to stop the fight.\n\nTaylor fought Bernard Hopkins for the Undisputed Middleweight Championship on July 16, 2005 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. At age 40, Hopkins entered the bout with a record 20 consecutive successful title defenses and had not lost a fight in 12 years. Hopkins entered the boxing match as a 3–2 favorite to win. Taylor was able to successfully use his jab to control the first two rounds of the fight, though neither fighter was taking any major risks. He tended to move forward, while Hopkins was patient and waited for openings in Taylor's defense. In round five, a clash of heads opened a cut on the top of Taylor's head. In the tenth round, Hopkins hurt Taylor with two right hands that made his legs wobble and forced him to clinch. Taylor won the bout by split decision with two judges scoring the fight 115–113 for Taylor and the other judge scoring it 116–112 for Hopkins. With the victory, Taylor became the new Undisputed Middleweight Champion, winning the WBC, WBO, IBF, WBA (Super), \"The Ring\" and Lineal Middleweight Championships. Hopkins appealed the decision, but was denied by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.\n\nOn December 3, 2005, Taylor defeated Hopkins by unanimous decision in a rematch at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. In order for the rematch to occur, Taylor vacated his IBF Middleweight title on October 11, 2005. Days before the fight, tensions rose after Hopkins mocked Taylor's speech impediment and called him a \"phony champion.\" Taylor responded by bringing a doll with Hopkins' name on it to the final prefight press conference to suggest that he was a \"crybaby.\" In a similar situation to the first fight, Hopkins started slowly and began pressuring Taylor in the later rounds. Hopkins ended the fight with a 101–60 advantage in power punches, while Taylor had success with his jab, outlanding Hopkins 64–29. All three judges scored the bout 115–113 for Taylor. After the fight, Taylor said that he would welcome a challenge against the winner of a fight between former Undisputed Light Middleweight Champion Winky Wright and Sam Soliman. On December 10, 2005, Wright defeated Soliman by unanimous decision to retain his number one position in the WBC and WBA Middleweight rankings and take over the number one spot in the IBF Middleweight rankings.\n\nOn June 17, 2006, Taylor fought Winky Wright at the FedEx Forum in Memphis, Tennessee. The WBC had ordered Taylor and Wright to begin negotiating on the fight on December 12, 2005 and if the two sides could not agree, a purse bid would be ordered. An agreement was made 10 minutes before a purse bid was to take place. Ozell Nelson, unsatisfied with Taylor's progression between the first and second Hopkins fights, helped convince Taylor to replace Pat Burns with hall of fame trainer Emanuel Steward. Taylor received $3.75 million for the fight and Wright made $3.5 million. Wright only paid sanctioning fees for the WBC belt, while Taylor paid fees to the WBC and WBO. Taylor did not pay the fees to the WBA amid controversy of the organization removing him from their rankings after questions of whether Taylor followed all procedures for the WBA before his rematch with Hopkins. He was reinstated at the top the organizations' middleweight rankings, but his title remained under review. The bout was evenly competitive through the first 10 rounds, with Wright winning most of the early rounds before Taylor became more active in the latter part of the fight. By the ninth round, Wright had swelling above both his eyes. Wright was winning the bout going into the final round on two of the judges' scorecards, but he was generally passive in the round. Two of the three judges gave the round to Taylor, which resulted in a draw. The scores for the fight were 115–113 for Taylor, 115–113 for Wright and 114–114.\n\nOn December 9, 2006, Taylor fought Kassim Ouma at the Alltel Arena in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Taylor hurt Ouma early in the first round and continued to control the fight through the middle part of the fight with jabs and hooks. During the second half of the fight, Taylor gradually began to tire and suffered a cut over the left eye. He allowed Ouma to back him into the ropes often as the fight came to an end. However, Ouma was unable to be effective with his punches. Taylor won the bout by unanimous decision with scores of 117–111, 115–113 and 118–110. Afterwards, the WBA announced that Taylor was no longer the holder of its Middleweight Super Championship. On May 19, 2007, Taylor went up against former Undisputed Welterweight Champion Cory Spinks at the FedEx Forum in Memphis. Taylor dictated the fight by staying away from Spinks and landing one punch at a time. He hurt Spinks with a right hand in the seventh round. Spinks, with a much shorter reach, had difficulty getting within a closer range against his opponent. Taylor landed 101 of 319 punches, while Spinks landed just 85 of 542. Taylor won the fight by split decision, with two judges scoring 117–111 and 115–113 in favor of him and the other scoring 117–111 for Spinks.\n\nIn his next bout, Taylor fought Kelly Pavlik on September 29, 2007 at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Pavlik began rising in popularity after an upset victory over Edison Miranda in a Middleweight Title Eliminator to determine the number one contender to fight Taylor. During their amateur careers, Taylor had defeated Pavlik on February 9, 2000 in the opening round of the United States Olympic trials. In the second round of the bout, Taylor landed a right hand and followed-up with several more punches which resulted in the first knockdown of the fight. Pavlik got up and managed to make it to the end of the round. Entering the seventh round, Taylor had a commanding lead on all three judges' scorecards. With less than a minute remaining in the round, Pavlik landed a right cross that sent Taylor into a corner. Pavlik closed in and threw a left uppercut followed by a left and right hook and right uppercut. Two more left hooks dropped Taylor to the canvas as the referee stepped in to halt the fight. It was the first time Taylor had lost in his professional career and the first time he had ever been knocked down. One month later, Taylor exercised a rematch clause in his contract with Pavlik. The rematch took place at a weight of , six pounds higher than the middleweight limit. Due to disappointing performances, Emanuel Steward was fired as Taylor's trainer and replaced with Ozell Nelson. Fighting at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on February 16, 2008, Taylor lost the rematch to Pavlik by unanimous decision.\n\nAfter the two losses to Pavlik, Taylor moved up officially to the super middleweight division. On November 15, 2008, Taylor defeated Jeff Lacy by a dominant unanimous decision to earn a mandatory fight against the winner of a bout between Carl Froch and Jean Pascal for the vacant WBC Super Middleweight title, a fight that was won by Froch. On April 25, 2009, at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut, Taylor fought Carl Froch for the WBC Super Middleweight title. Taylor was able to control the first two rounds of the fight. In the third round, Taylor knocked Froch down for the first time in his career with a right hand. Entering the final round, Taylor was ahead 106–102 on two of the judges' scorecards, while Froch was ahead 106–102 on the other. During the round, Froch landed two right hands that sent Taylor to the canvas. He got up, but Froch quickly went after him, trapping him against the ropes and landing a barrage of hard and fast punches. Taylor could not recoup or defend himself, desperately curling up against the ropes. Around 10 clean hard shots from Froch landed before the referee stepped in to stop the bout with only a matter of seconds left in the final round, earning Froch the technical knockout victory.\n\nTaylor competed in the preliminary round of the Super Six World Boxing Classic, a tournament by Showtime, to find out who is the best boxer in the super middleweight division.\n\nOn October 17, 2009, in his first fight in the Super Six tournament at the O2 World Arena in Berlin, Germany, undefeated Armenian-German former champion, Arthur Abraham, defeated Jermain Taylor by KO in the 12th round with less than 10 seconds left in the fight. Taylor was hospitalized with a severe concussion, suffering short term memory loss, unable to remember details of this bout. After being released from the hospital, Taylor released a statement saying that he's doing just fine and wanted to congratulate Abraham on his victory and wish him well in the tournament. At the time of the stoppage, the judges scorecards read: 104-102, 107-102 and 106-102, all in favour of Abraham.\n\nIn January 2010, Taylor, one of the original members of the Super Six World Boxing Classic, officially withdrew from the tournament. The former Undisputed Middleweight Champion issued a statement in early 2010 saying, \"I'm going to take some time off from the sport of boxing and take myself out of the SHOWTIME Sports World Boxing Classic tournament. It's important that I give my body and mind some much needed rest, because I have been boxing for nearly 20 years,\" said Taylor. \"I plan on keeping myself in shape and making a return to the sport sometime in the future. This was not an easy decision for me, having discussed it with my family, trainer, friends and my adviser Al Haymon, because I'm a very competitive person-but I know this is the smart road for me to take.\" Taylor was later replaced by Allan Green.\n\nOn December 30, 2011, after 26 months away from the ring, Taylor finally returned and faced Jessie Nicklow. In a fight scheduled for ten rounds, Taylor won via technical knockout in the eighth round. He then took on then-undefeated Caleb Truax (18-0-1) on April 25, 2012 in another fight scheduled for ten rounds. Taylor controlled most of the action and survived a knock-down in round nine in order to win a unanimous decision victory.\n\nTaylor then faced boxing veteran Raul Munoz on October 12, 2012. He made short work of Muñoz, winning via second-round KO.\n\nTaylor's next bout was against Juan Carlos Candelo on December 14, 2013. Jermaine won with a seventh-round TKO.\n\nOn October 4, 2014, Taylor fought Sam Soliman, in Biloxi, Mississippi for Soliman's IBF Middleweight World Championship belt. After twelve grueling rounds, (Soliman injured his knee badly midway through the fight) and knocking Soliman down four times (Soliman actually went down on his own from the knee injury, not primarily from punches from Taylor), Taylor won with a resounding unanimous decision. By regaining the belt he had lost to Pavlik in 2007, Taylor became a two-time middleweight world champion.\n\nOn February 6, 2015 Taylor was scheduled to defend his title against Sergio Mora on ESPN2's Friday Night Fights in Biloxi, Mississippi. However, the fight was cancelled after Taylor suffered an injury and was also later arrested and charged with multiple felonies following an incident on January 19 (see Personal life below). The IBF subsequently stripped him of his title on February 6, due to his inability to defend during his ongoing legal and mental health issues.\n\nTaylor was married to former Louisiana Tech University basketball player Erica Taylor, who was selected in the second round of the 2005 WNBA Draft by the Washington Mystics. Jermain and Erica Taylor have three daughters. Jermaine has a son also Jermain Taylor JR. Taylor gained popularity in the state for frequently mentioning how proud he was to be from Arkansas. He is known to be an enthusiastic fan of the University of Arkansas Razorbacks and has visited the Arkansas campus to talk to the football team. Taylor often sports a large Razorback on the back of his boxing robe and trunks for his fights. He was named \"Arkansan of the Year\" for 2005 by the \"Arkansas Times\". In 2007, Taylor was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame along with former NFL players Rod Smith and Willie Roaf. Taylor has modeled for Everlast, \"GQ\" and \"Vogue\".\n\nLou Dibella resigned as Taylor's promoter because he was concerned with Taylor's health following the knockout from Arthur Abraham in the Super Six tournament. Taylor had been knocked out two times prior to the Abraham bout.\n\nOn August 26, 2014, Taylor was taken into police custody and charged with two felonies after officers said he shot his cousin during an altercation in his Little Rock, Arkansas, home. Taylor was out on bond for his October 4, 2014, bout versus Sam Soliman. On January 19, 2015, Taylor was arrested without incident and a gun was recovered. He was jailed on five felony counts of aggravated assault, three felony counts of endangering the welfare of a minor, and a misdemeanor count of drug possession after he was found to have a small bag of marijuana. Taylor was remanded to the custody of the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility in Little Rock in lieu of a $27,000 bond.\n\nOn May 20, 2016, Taylor was given a suspended sentence of 19 years to be served concurrently, amounting to a six-year suspended sentence for three cases. He was also sentenced to probation and will have to serve 120 hours of community service, pay a $2,000 fine plus court costs, and will have to submit to regular drug screens.\n\n"}

It is designed to connect Interstate 64 (I-64) and I-77 in West Virginia near Beckley to US 23 in Wise County, Virginia at Pound.\nWhile US 121 will not connect directly to US 21, it will intersect at the latter road's original alignment, now a part of I-77.\n\n The Coalfields Expressway will depart from U.S. 23 in Pound, Virginia, in Wise County, and roughly follow Virginia State Route 83 in Buchanan County to West Virginia Route 83 in McDowell County, West Virginia. Then it will travel northeast through depressed areas of West Virginia, paralleling West Virginia Route 16 through Wyoming and Raleigh counties. It will then run toward an expanded Interstate 64/Interstate 77 interchange near Beckley. The roadways US 121 will replace are deficient in the fact that the existing roadways have limited passing opportunities, steep grades, and low design speeds. \n\nAs of June 2013, of US 121 is open to traffic in West Virginia, currently signed as West Virginia Route 121 (WV 121).\n\nIn Virginia, the Coalfields Expressway will run for , following Virginia Route 83 from the West Virginia border to U.S. Highway 23 in Pound. Near the Grundy - Vansant area, U.S. Route 460 will become a new four-lane highway connecting the Coalfields Expressway with Breaks Interstate Park at the Virginia / Kentucky border and Elkhorn City, Kentucky.\n\nConstruction started in 1999 with a three-level diamond interchange near Welch in western West Virginia.

Grading and preliminary paving operations have been completed, as well as the gradings and bridge construction for a diamond interchange for West Virginia Route 54 and a bridge over West Virginia Route 16. In November 2004, a contract was awarded for paving operations at a cost of $11.5 million from Surveyor Creek Road to the West Virginia Route 16 interchange. With this segment of the Expressway completed, a new tie-in will be complete from Surveyor Creek Road to five-lane West Virginia Route 16, as well as an interchange with West Virginia Route 54.\n\nTwo contracts totaling $22.2 million are currently under construction.

Governor Justice requested $54.4 million for grading in Wyoming County. The construction would be financed through raising taxes. In an upcoming ballot issue to approve of road bonds, Governor Justice allocated $55 million to extend the road from Slab Fork to Mullens and eventually to Welch.

{"id": "1862354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862354", "title": "Yamato-e", "text": "Yamato-e\n\nCharacteristic features of Yamato-e include many small figures and careful depictions of details of buildings and other objects, the selection of only some elements of a scene to be fully depicted, the rest either being ignored or covered by a \"floating cloud\", an oblique view from above showing interiors of buildings as though through a cutaway roof, and very stylised depiction of landscape.\n\nYamato-e very often depict narrative stories, with or without accompanying text, but also show the beauty of nature, with famous places or the four seasons . The pictures are often on scrolls that can be hung on a wall (), handscrolls () that are read from right to left, or on a folding screen () or panel (). Although they received their name from the Yamato period, no Yamato-e paintings from this period survive, nor from several centuries afterwards. Yamato-e pictures rather stand for a style and are not restricted to a particular period.\n\nThere was a revival of the Yamato-e style in the 15th century by the Tosa school, including a return to narrative subjects, and although the rival Kanō school grew out of the alternative tradition of Chinese-style works, the style it developed from the late 16th century for large paintings decorating Japanese castles included some elements of the Yamato-e style. In the 17th century, the simplified and stylised depiction of landscape backgrounds in Yamato-e was revived as a style for large landscape works by the Rinpa school. Later the narrative element of Yamato-e, the interest in the depiction of everyday life, and the choice of oblique and partial views in a composition heavily influenced the ukiyo-e style, as well as the Nihonga.\n\nThe term Yamato-e is found in Heian texts, although the precise range of works it covered then, and also in subsequent periods, is a much debated topic. There are also references showing a distinction within Yamato-e between \"women's painting\" and \"men's painting\". This distinction is also much debated but the typical assumptions as to its meaning can be illustrated by works from each group discussed in the next two sections; both are famous masterpieces and National Treasures of Japan. \n\nThe range of works discussed below, all usually considered to be embraced by the term Yamato-e, is considerable, but most are narrative handscrolls with many small figures. There were evidently also many screens and works in other formats in the various styles, of which few traces remain. The Yamato-e style is apparent in the landscape background of some of the Buddhist paintings which are the most numerous survivals of Heian painting.\n\nThe oldest Yamato-e works to survive are four famous 12th century handscrolls of parts of \"The Tale of Genji\", three in the Tokugawa Art Museum in Nagoya, with another from the same set in the Gotoh Museum in Tokyo; together they are known as the \"Genji Monogatari Emaki\". Only a small proportion, about 15%, of the original survives, assuming this was complete. The original scrolls would have totalled about 450 feet long, in 20 rolls which alternate text with images, containing over 100 paintings, with over 300 sections of calligraphy. The surviving scrolls consist of only 19 paintings, 65 sheets of text, and 9 pages of fragments.\n\nThe paintings show an already mature tradition that has developed a considerable way from its Chinese origins. Conventions include the angled view from above into roofless rooms, and very simplified facial details, allowing minimal expressiveness. The colours are fresh and bright, built up in a technique called where a first outline is covered by several layers of pigment, with final lines added on top. Only one example survives from so early comparable to the painted screens shown at the rear in the interior scene illustrated. As female figures, mostly shown in a state of elegant lassitude, far outnumber the men, this is taken as an exemplar of \"women's painting\".\n\nThe \"Shigisan-engi\" or \"Legend of Mount Shigi\" tells the story of the 9th century Shingon monk Myoren, founder of the Chogosonshi-ji temple. Like contemporary Western hagiographies, the narrative contains miracles, including a famous episode of the \"flying storehouse\" (illustrated). The story takes place mostly among ordinary country people, and is shown as one continuous picture about 30 feet long, with the same characters recurring in different scenes which are connected by a continuous background (something also found in medieval Western art). The images are done in a very different technique, with ink drawing lightly coloured by washes. Most figures are men, and when women are shown, as in , they are shown in a very different way to the figures in the \"Genji Monogatari Emaki\". Facial features are shown in far more detail than in the \"Genji Monogatari Emaki\", and a wide range of expressions are expertly depicted. This is an example of one version of what \"men's painting\" is taken to refer to.\n\nThe \"Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki\" is a now-incomplete illustrated version of \"The Diary of Lady Murasaki\", the author of \"The Tale of Genjii\", today surviving in four sections, with images of court ceremonies.\n\nAn early military and political work is the \"Ban Dainagon Ekotoba\" (The Tale of Great Minister Ban), a late 12th century (handscroll painting) depicting the events of the Ōtenmon Conspiracy, an event of Japan's early Heian period. The painting, attributed to Tokiwa Mitsunaga, is over 20 m long and about 31.5 cm tall.\n\nThe \"Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga\" represents a very different style within Yamato-e, with very lively pen drawings of men and anthropomorphic animals in a number of scenes.\n\nRather more examples survive from the following Kamakura period (1185–1333), including many showing scenes of life among the ordinary people, and also stories of wars from Japanese history. The \"Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba\" (Illustrated Account of the Mongol Invasion) are a pair of illustrated handscrolls from between 1275 and 1293. They were commissioned by the samurai Takezaki Suenaga in order to record his battlefield valour and deeds during the Mongol invasions of Japan.\n\nFrom near the end of the first period of works in the style, the \"Yūki Kassen Ekotoba\" is a handscroll nearly 3 metres long, with a single wide battle scene after a text section, illustrating the suicide of Ashikaga Mochiuji after his rebellion in 1439.\n\nFamous artists include: \n\n\n\n\n"}

Its eruptions were observed reaching up to in height, and it excited worldwide interest. Day trip visitors from Rotorua were keen to see the geyser erupting regularly for 5–6 hours out of a cycle of about 36 hours, and a tourist trip called the \"Round Trip\" ran from the summer of 1902/1903. The geyser was the catalyst for tourism to the Waimangu Valley.\n\nIts workings were apparently created by the great 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption. The water expelled by the geyser was black with rocks and mud from the surrounding terrain, so the indigenous Māori people named the geyser Waimangu, meaning 'Black Waters'. The geyser gave its name to the surrounding geothermal region, the Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley.\n\nIn August 1903, tourist guide Alfred Warbrick measured the depth of the geyser lake at only when he launched a rowboat on the lake as a result of a dare. The lake's shallow depth was attributed to much of the ejected solid material falling back into the vent each time.\n\nOn 30 August 1903, New Zealand rugby international Joe Warbrick, David McNaughton, and sisters Ruby and Catherine Nicholls were killed after venturing close to the edge of the geyser, having ignored requests from Warbrick's brother Alfred to return to a safe distance. The four were scalded and then swept away in a sudden violent eruption.\n\nIn mid-1904, the geyser became dormant for several weeks and subsequent eruptions were shorter and weaker until they stopped on 1 November 1904. This coincided with a landslide that changed the water table of Lake Tarawera by several metres. While it was hypothesized that this was the cause for the extinction of the geyser, later studies found no apparent physical connection between these two events.\n\nThe geyser became extinct in 1908. Afterwards, hydrothermal activity in the nearby Echo Crater increased, leading to eruptions in the crater in 1915, 1917, and 1924.\n\n"}

Warna was the station that reached the most Malay listeners while Oli had the highest reach of Indian listeners.\n\nThe top four stations with the longest time spent listening weekly are CAPITAL 958 with 13 hours, Warna 942 at 12 hours 33 minutes, LOVE 972 at 11 hours 16 minutes and Oli at 9 hours 39 minutes.\n\nSPH Radio\n\nThe five radio stations owned by leading media company Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) - English stations Kiss 92FM, ONE FM 91.3 and MONEY FM 89.3 as well as Chinese stations UFM100.3 and 96.3 Hao FM - increased their total listenership by 10 percent and share of audience by 13 percent.\n\nLeading the pack is UFM100.3, with a significant listenership jump of 27 percent, the highest amongst all Chinese radio stations in Singapore. 96.3 Hao FM, SPH Radio's other Chinese radio station targeting a more mature audience, also showed a big listenership increase of 24 percent with its core audience aged 40 to 59. This was the highest growth amongst Chinese radio stations aimed at mature listeners.\n\nSPH Radio's English stations also saw listenership growth, with increases coming from Kiss 92FM and ONE FM 91.3 at 4 percent and 16 percent respectively. ONE FM 91.3 registered the highest growth in audience time spent listening amongst all English radio stations at 48 percent. The survey also shows that SPH radio listeners are active consumers of the various SPH news platform.\n\nListenership figures of radio stations \n\nAccording to findings from Nielsen Radio Diary Survey Wave 2, 2019 for Singapore, the listenership figures of radio stations in Singapore are as follows:\n\n\n\nMediacorp used to operate Digital Radio, a radio service using digital audio broadcasting technology which simulcast eight FM stations, namely Class 95FM, Gold 905FM, 987FM, Y.E.S. 93.3FM, Love 97.2FM, Symphony 92.4FM, and CNA938 and broadcast six digital-only stations, namely Cruise, Club Play, JK-Pop, Chinese Evergreens, Planet Bollywood and Bloomberg.\n\nThe service was discontinued on 1 December 2011 as the low adoption of DAB radio (compared to FM radio) and the prevalence of listening to Internet radio streams on computers and mobile devices has rendered DAB radio irrelevant.\n\nLaunched in 1994, Radio Singapore International (RSI) operated as the external service for Singapore. The station launched a signature program in 1996 called ‘Friends of the Airwaves’ reaching out throughout South-East Asia. The station featured programs in several languages, and was chiefly run by MediaCorp Radio. RSI ceased operation on 31 July 2008.\n\n"}

Written in exile in the United States, it tells the story of Cheng's arrest during the first days of the Cultural Revolution, her more than six years' confinement, release, persecution, efforts to leave China, and early life in exile.\n\nCheng was arrested in late 1966 after the Red Guards looted her home. During her confinement, she was pressured to make a false confession that she was a spy for \"the imperialists\" because for many years after the death of her husband she had continued to work as a senior partner for Shell in Shanghai. Cheng refused to provide a false confession, and was tortured as a result.\n\nShe was eventually paroled under the pretense that her attitude had shown improvement. However, Cheng resisted leaving the detention house without receiving acknowledgment from her captors that she had been unjustly treated.\n\nWhen released from jail in 1973, Cheng found that her daughter Meiping, who had been studying to become a film actress, had been murdered by the Red Guards, although the official position was that she had committed suicide. Cheng conducted a discreet investigation and found that this scenario was impossible.\n\nAfter being relocated from her spacious home to a mere two bedrooms on the second floor of a two-story building, Cheng continued her life under constant surveillance, including spying by the family on the first floor.\n\nShe lived in China until 1980, when the political climate warmed enough for her to apply for a visa to the United States to visit family. She never returned, first emigrating to Canada, and later to Washington, D.C., where she wrote the autobiography.\n\nThe autobiography goes into great detail about her persecution, confinement and torture, so much so that the author had to put the manuscript away many times as she wrote it because the memories were so troubling.\n\n"}
{"id": "1862404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862404", "title": "Dynamic Data Exchange", "text": "Dynamic Data Exchange\n\nIn computing, Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a technology for interprocess communication used in early versions of Microsoft Windows or OS/2. DDE allows programs to manipulate objects provided by other programs (for example, a cell in an embedded Microsoft Excel spreadsheet), and respond to user actions affecting those objects. Internally, DDE is implemented in terms of Windows' message-passing architecture, which leaves it vulnerable to malformed third-party programs. DDE is partially superseded by Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and is currently maintained in Windows systems only for the sake of backwards compatibility.\n\nDynamic Data Exchange was first introduced in 1987 with the release of Windows 2.0 as a method of interprocess communication so that one program could communicate with or control another program, somewhat like Sun's RPC (Remote Procedure Call). At the time, the only method for communication between the operating system and client applications was the \"Windows Messaging Layer.\" DDE extended this protocol to allow peer-to-peer communication among client applications, via message broadcasts. \n\nBecause DDE runs via message broadcasts, it is vulnerable to any window-management code that does not pump messages. This problem was not considered during the design of DDE, because DDE predates pre-emptive multitasking. \n\nMoreover, any code managing a window handle can respond to a DDE broadcast; the initiator of DDE must distinguish between expected and unexpected responses. DDE interlocutors usually express what information they seek in terms of hierarchical string keys. For example, a cell in Microsoft Excel was known to DDE by its \"application\" name. Each application could further organize information by groups known as \"topic\" and each topic could serve up individual pieces of data as an \"item\". For example, if a user wanted to pull a value from Microsoft Excel which was contained in a spreadsheet called \"Book1.xls\" in the cell in the first row and first column, the application would be \"Excel\", the topic \"Book1.xls\" and the item \"r1c1\". Internal changes in the cell due to Excel actions would then be signaled (in reverse) to the calling application via additional message broadcasts.\n\nThe common use of DDE is for custom-developed applications to control off-the-shelf software. For example, a custom in-house application might use DDE to open a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and fill it with data, by opening a DDE conversation with Excel and sending it DDE commands. This feature has mainly been superseded by the Component Object Model suite of technologies. Microsoft has not used DDE internally since the release of Windows 95. For example, Excel now exposes an extensive OLE Automation object model, which is the recommended method for communicating with Excel. The technique is, however, still in use, particularly for distribution of financial data. DDE is also the primary method of interprocess communication in the internals of the SAS programming language. Because DDE does not require more operating system components than a conventional Windows GUI program, it is also a (little-used) alternative for programs seeking to minimize their dependencies. \n\nWonderware developed an extension for DDE called NetDDE that could be used to initiate and maintain the network connections needed for DDE conversations between DDE-aware applications running on different computers in a network and transparently exchange data. A DDE conversation is an interaction between client and server applications. NetDDE could be used along with DDE and the DDE management library (DDEML) in applications.\ncodice_1\nThe NetDDE library files\nMicrosoft licensed a basic (NetBIOS Frames protocol only) version of the product for inclusion in various versions of Windows from Windows for Workgroups to Windows XP. In addition, Wonderware also sold an enhanced version of NetDDE to their own customers that included support for TCP/IP. The technology is extensively used in the SCADA field. Basic Windows applications using NetDDE are Clipbook Viewer, WinChat and Microsoft Hearts.\n\nNetDDE was still included with Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Service Pack 2, although it was disabled by default. It has been removed entirely in Windows Vista. However, this will not prevent existing versions of NetDDE from being installed and functioning on later versions of Windows.\n\n\n\n"}

He is also the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from January to June 2001 and from 2010 to 2016. He served as the Mayor of Quezon City from 2001 to 2010, where he was hailed Most Outstanding City Mayor of the Philippines.\n\nBelmonte was born at 1:35 PM on October 2, 1936 at Emmanuel Community Hospital in Tondo, Manila to judge Feliciano Belmonte Sr. and Luz Racimo. He attended grade school in Baguio City and earned his high-school diploma at the San Beda University in Manila. He finished Law at the Lyceum of the Philippines University; while in law school, he worked as a reporter at the \"Manila Chronicle\", covering the police beat and events at the Philippine Commission on Elections.\n\nBelmonte began his government service as the presidential staff assistant of President Diosdado Macapagal. He also worked as a special assistant for the Commissioner of Customs, and as an executive assistant at the Central Bank of the Philippines. In 1986, President Corazon Aquino assigned him to head various financially struggling government-owned corporations. He became President and General Manager of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the Manila Hotel and chairman of the National Reinsurance Corporation of the Philippines. He also represented the government as member of the board of directors of the San Miguel Corporation and the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT). More importantly, he assumed the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of Philippine Airlines, which was then wholly owned by the Philippine government.\n\nBelmonte was first elected as member of the House of Representatives from Quezon City's fourth congressional district. He held his House seat for three consecutive terms, from 1992 to 2001. Belmonte was Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2001, and also served as House Minority Leader. In his first two terms, he was the Vice Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nDuring his term as Congressman, he authored and co-authored several major bills, among them:\n\nAlthough largely concerned with budget and financial matters, Belmonte also did work for the low-salaried employees, and was instrumental in the passage of the Second Salary Standardization Law (SSL 2), which corrected the gross inequities of SSL 1. He also pushed for the continued implementation of the Personal Economic Relief Alliance (PERA) for low-salaried government personnel.\n\nBelmonte gained national prominence as the lead prosecutor in the impeachment trial of President Joseph Estrada. On January 20, 2001, during the EDSA Revolution of 2001, Estrada left the Malacañan Palace and Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was sworn to the presidency at the EDSA Shrine by Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. Accompanying Davide were the chairs of the two houses of Congress, Aquilino Pimentel Jr. and Fuentebella. Four days later, on January 24, the Arroyo allies mustered enough votes to unseat Fuentebella, replacing him with Belmonte.\n\nIn 2001, he won the election for the position of Mayor of Quezon City, and was re-elected in 2004 and in 2007. As Mayor of Quezon City, his nine years of prudent fiscal management, aggressive tax management strategies, as well as increasing efficiency and growing discipline in the management, and use of City resources has made Quezon City the most competitive city of Metro Manila, and second in the Philippines today. These are rankings made by businessmen in the Philippines in studies of the Asian Institute of Management, in cooperation with international agencies.\nQuezon City was cited for the dynamism of its local economy, the quality of life of its residents, and the responsiveness of the local government in addressing business and other needs.\n\nIn 2007, Quezon City was ranked No. 7 Asian City of the Future, based on a survey commissioned by the \"London Financial Times\", through a consultancy based in Singapore.\n\nIn a 2008 Tholons special report on global services, Quezon City ranked as the number 21 emerging global outsourcing city, the highest among all nine new entrants.\nBelmonte was a long-standing member of the administration Lakas-Kampi-CMD party from his first term in Congress in 1992 until November 2009, where he last held the position of senior vice president for externals. On November 19, 2009, he and his vice mayor, Herbert Bautista, were sworn in as members of the opposition Liberal Party.\n\nAfter serving as Mayor of Quezon City, Belmonte made a successful bid for a fourth term in the House of Representatives. At the opening of the 15th Congress, Belmonte was again elected as Speaker of the House, defeating Edcel Lagman of the former ruling party Lakas Kampi CMD, with a vote of 227–29. He succeeded Prospero Nograles, whose term had ended almost a month earlier.\n\nBelmonte was a member of the Manila Jaycees, the Rotary Club of Manila and the Knights of Rizal. He was also Junior Chamber International World President in 1976.\n\nHe was married to Betty Go-Belmonte (1934–1994), founder of \"The Philippine Star\". They have raised four children: Isaac, Kevin, Miguel and Joy. Their three sons have also held editorial and managerial positions at the \"Philippine Star\" and its sister publications like \"Pilipino Star Ngayon\" and \"Pang-Masa\" tabloids published in the Filipino vernacular, as well as the Cebu-based newspaper The Freeman. His daughter, Joy, is the incumbent Mayor of Quezon City since 2019.\n"}

He serves as representative of the 1st district of Marikina City since June 2016. It is in the term of President Gloria Arroyo, where he served as Chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) he gained notability and mixed public reaction on his style of governance. He announced his intention to run for President of the Philippines in the 2010 general elections, but after talks with Richard Gordon, he agreed to run instead as Vice-President under Gordon's newly established party, Bagumbayan. Their ticket was dubbed \"the Transformers\"; he lost in the polls, placing fourth.\n\nBayani Fernando was born in San Juan del Monte, Rizal (now part of the Metro Manila) to Gil Fernando and Remedios Flores and finished his secondary education at the Marikina School of Arts and Trades (now Marikina Science High School). He finished college with a degree on Mechanical Engineering at the Mapúa Institute of Technology.\n\nFernando first ran for public office in 1992, becoming mayor of Marikina City. His administration as mayor transformed the former municipality into one of the best-managed cities and a paradigm of responsive and effective governance. His term saw the transformation of Marikina from a 4th class municipality to a model Philippine city accorded with 55 citations and distinctions. He was re-elected mayor twice, serving until 2001. He was succeeded by his wife, Ma. Lourdes C. Fernando.\n\nIn 2002, he was appointed Chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, directing him to duplicate his transformation work in Marikina City, but for the entire Metro Manila.\n\nFor his work as Chairman, he was conferred the Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa, Ateneo de Cagayan, The Outstanding Filipino (TOFIL) Award for Government Service, the H.R Reyes Academic Medallion of Honor, Central Colleges of the Philippines and Doctor of the Public Administration, Honoris Causa by the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.\n\nHe is notable for introducing U-Turn slots, greatly increasing the amount of pedestrian overpasses at road intersections (called footbridges), pioneering broadcasting of the MMDA, sidewalk clearing operations, and revitalizing the assets and fleets of the government agency. Although some of his policies and structures were met with resistance and complaints, many of these can be still seen today. Subsequent MMDA chairmen continued many of BF's contribution, particularly the construction of footbridges.\n\nFernando briefly served as Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) from January 15, 2003 until April 15, 2003.\n\nOn January 4, 2008, Fernando announced that he would be running for the presidency in the 2010 elections. Fernando hinted that he had gathered the funds and logistics required for a nationwide campaign and was intent on running for the presidency with or without the support of his party, Lakas-CMD. But on September 16, 2009, when Lakas-CMD chose Gilbert “Gibo” C. Teodoro to represent their party for the presidency, Fernando reiterated \"he is keeping his options open and may possibly run as an independent candidate or bolt out of the party.\"\n\nAfter talks with Richard Gordon, he agreed to slide to Vice-President under Richard Gordon's party. But he lost to Makati City Mayor Jejomar Binay and finished fourth.\n\nNothing was heard from Bayani Fernando after the elections; however, he made an appearance again with current MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino, in the issue of informal settlers and the perennial flooding crisis, defending Tolentino in the flood control issues.\n\nOn July 25, 2012, a Telephone Interview with Bayani Fernando was made by Senator Richard Gordon in a TV5 Radio Program. Bayani is now busy with his construction and metal fabrication business at BF Corporation.\n\nHe ran again, this time for the position of Congressman of 1st district of Marikina City in the 2016 local elections, marking his political comeback in Marikina.

{"id": "1862422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862422", "title": "Hispano-Moresque ware", "text": "Hispano-Moresque ware\n\nHispano-Moresque ware is a style of initially Islamic pottery created in Al Andalus or Muslim Spain, which continued to be produced under Christian rule in styles blending Islamic and European elements. It was the most elaborate and luxurious pottery being produced in Europe until the Italian maiolica industry developed sophisticated styles in the 15th century, and was exported over most of Europe. The industry's most successful period was the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nAround 711, the Moors conquered Spain. Over the following centuries, they introduced two ceramic techniques to Europe: glazing with an opaque white tin-glaze, and lustreware, which imitates metallic finishes with iridescent effects. Hispano-Moresque wares use both processes, applying the paint as an overglaze which is then fired again. Lustreware was a speciality of Islamic pottery, at least partly because the use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the Hadiths, with the result that pottery and glass were used for tableware by Muslim elites, when Christian medieval elites still normally used metal for both dishes and cups.\n\nAt first centred on Málaga in the south, and using typical Islamic decoration, by the 15th century the largest production was around Valencia, which had long been reconquered by the Crown of Aragon. Wares from Manises and other Valencian towns were mainly for the Christian market, and exported very widely.\n\nThe earliest major centre of fine pottery in Al-Andalus was Málaga in southern Spain. This is the major centre whose best-known wares were produced in a Muslim kingdom, as opposed to by a workforce presumed to be largely Muslim, or Morisco, under Christian rule. It was already celebrated for its gold lustrewares in the 14th century, and remained under Muslim rule until 1487, shortly before the fall of Granada, the last Moorish kingdom. Murcia, Almería, and perhaps Granada itself were also early centres of production. This pottery stayed much closer to styles seen in other Islamic countries, although much of it was being exported to Christian markets, as can be seen by the coats of arms on many pieces.\n\nWares from Málaga were celebrated for their gold lustre on white enamel; they are distinguished from lustreware from Granada by the inclusion of blue paint with the gold lustre over a red clay that is characteristic of the region. \n\nAt least one authority, Alan Caiger-Smith, excludes this pottery from the term \"Hispano-Moresque\", but most who use the term at all use it to include Malaga and other Andalusian wares from the Islamic period as well as the Valencian pottery. When Spanish medieval pottery was first studied in the 19th century, there was awareness of the Valencian centres but very little of the Al-Andalus ones, and there has been a steady re-attribution of types of pottery formerly attributed to Manises to Malaga and the south, which was still continuing in the 1980s, following archaeological discoveries in Malaga, and scientific analysis of the clays used.\n\nThough other types of painted pottery, not usually called Hispano-Moresque ware, were produced in Al-Andaluz earlier, firm evidence of lustreware production is not found before the early or mid-13th century, when it may have been begun by Egyptian potters escaping political disturbances. Already it was being exported, as some of the earliest evidence is bowls set as decoration into the facades of churches in Pisa when they were built. An import from Malaga through Sandwich, Kent in England for the Spanish-born Queen Eleanor of Castile was recorded in 1289, consisting of \"42 bowls, 10 dishes, and 4 earthenware jars of foreign colour (\"extranei coloris\")\". Malagan ware was also exported to the Islamic world, and has been found at Fustat (medieval Cairo) and elsewhere.\nThe best known and most impressive examples of Andalucian wares are the Alhambra vases, a number of very large vases made to stand in niches in the Alhambra in Granada, and perhaps elsewhere. These are very atypical in Islamic pottery in having only a decorative function, with no practical purpose, and are \"by far\" the largest pieces of lustreware known. They are based on traditional shapes descended from the ancient amphora, but at about 115 to 170 cm tall are close to the height of a human. They are thought to come from a range of dates covering the late 14th and the 15th centuries, and the decoration and precise shape of the body is different in each surviving example. According to Alan Caiger-Smith, \"few other pots in the world make such a strong physical impression\". \n\nAll are now in museums, five in Spain and others in St Petersburg, Berlin, Washington D.C., Stockholm and Palermo; various large fragments also survive. Lustre tiles are also still in place at the Alhambra. The \"Fortuny Tablet\", a unique plaque measuring 90 x 44 cm, has a garden-like design, inside a border with an inscription praising Yusuf III, Sultan of Granada (r. 1408-1417). Its design resembles that of some Spanish carpets.\n\nAfter Yusuf's throne was inherited by an eight-year-old in 1418, the Nasrid kingdom went into a decline before its final conquest, and the production of fine pottery seems to cease abruptly about 1450, even though the name \"obra de Malequa\" (\"Malaga work\") continued to be used in Valencia for lustreware long afterwards.\n\nValencia and its suburbs Manises and Paterna became important centres after potters migrated there from the south; the city had returned to Christian rule from 1238, and the immigration of skilled potters had been going on since at least the mid-14th century. In 1362 a cardinal commissioned floor-tiles in \"obra de Malicha\" (\"Malaga work\", probably meaning lustreware) for the Pope's Palais des Papes in Avignon from two masters in Manises, at least one with an Arabic name (though \"Juan\" as his forename). In 1484 a German traveller mentioned vessels \"which are made by the Moorish potters\".\n\nIt seems that the local lords of Manises, the family of Buyl, encouraged the immigration, and may have acted as distributors and agents for the product; certainly when Maria of Castile, Queen of Aragon, wanted to order a large service in 1454, she wrote to the Buyl lord for him to arrange it. Several Buyl's had served as ambassadors, to Granada as well as Christian courts, giving them contacts in many markets. They seem to have taken a 10% royalty on all sales of pottery, and enjoyed a very high income from these. The largest deposit of Manises ware found by archaeology, apart from Manises itself, comes from Sluis in the Netherlands, then part of the territories of the wealthy Duchy of Burgundy. Manises also had clay and a cave nearby where a special sand used as a raw material for glazes was extracted.\n\nBarcelona in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, which was under Muslim rule from 718 to 801, became a centre for pottery much later, probably receiving immigrant Christian potters from Al-Andalus, especially Valencia, during the later Reconquista period. It was important at first for wares resembling the brown and green decorated pottery of Paterna and in the 16th century for lustreware in a \"warm silvery-gold\", either reflecting different materials available, or a deliberate change in style. Several other towns began to produce lustreware in the same period.\n\nMuch, in Valencia most, of the pottery was clearly made for a Christian market, as it includes coats of arms and other Western elements in the decoration. As well as the Christian IHS monogram in the centre, the naturalistic vine-leaf decoration of the dish shown at top is derived from Gothic art, probably via the border decoration of illuminated manuscripts. No pieces have yet been found that are signed (as many pieces from other Islamic regions are), and hardly any dated, so heraldry, especially when pieces are assumed to have been commissioned to celebrate a wedding, is important evidence for dating. The pieces \"had to be spectacular and elegant, yet every category of vessel had a particular use\" and on grand occasions all might be used, even though the largest platters spent most of the time on display propped up vertically on sideboards, as is shown in some contemporary paintings.\n\nAndalucian designs use a repertoire of geometric motifs, many of which probably had a religious significance of which Christian buyers remained unaware. These are usually contained in painted compartments. Pseudo-Kufic script is used, as well as inscriptions in proper Arabic. The dominant colours of gold and blue perhaps represent the sun and sky; other colours available, such as brown, green and yellow, are much less used. From about 1400 some elements, including the depiction of animals, which were probably first used for export wares seem to have become popular among local Muslim buyers also; two of the later \"Alhambra vases\" described above have pairs of gazelles. By then the Nasrid kings of Granada had given themselves heraldic arms in the Christian way, which are also seen on pottery.\n\nMany large Valencian dishes with typical complicated designs centring on a coat of arms are also decorated on the underside with boldly-painted animal figures occupying the whole space, often also taken from heraldry. Of Manises ware, Alan Caiger-Smith has written, \"the sustained production of fine pieces at Manises during the years 1380–1430 is without parallel in the history of ceramics. Many of these vessels will keep their place among the world's finest pottery for ever; regardless of changes and outlook.\" \n\nHispano-Moresque shapes of the fifteenth century included the \"albarello\" (a tall jar), large serving dishes with coats of arms, made for wealthy people all over Europe, jugs (some on high feet, the \"citra\" and the \"grealet\"), a deep-sided dish (the \"lebrillo de alo\") and the eared bowl (\"cuenco de oreja\"). Hispano-Moresque wares had a considerable influence on early Italian maiolica, indeed two possible derivations of the name have connections with it. Towards the end of the century designs began to incorporate raised elements in imitation of European silverware shapes, such as gadrooning. Tiles were made in all centres, and the small ceramic tombstone of an Andalucian student who died in 1409 is one of the very few precisely datable pieces.\n\nAlbert Van de Put categorizes the decorative motifs into ten categories: large mock-Arabic character, small mock-Arabic character, spur-band and cross-hatching, flower and leaf on dotted ground, large vine-leaf and small flower (two sizes), foliage, bryony leaf and small flower, smaller rounded vine-leaf, and diapering of dots and stalks derived from preceding, and gadroons.\n\nAlan Caiger-Smith describes the Valencian industry as the victim of its own success; as the wares initially produced for the very top of society, usually as bespoke commissions with personalized heraldry, were demanded by the expanding lesser nobility and bourgeoisie, both the size of pieces and their quality of decoration declined, with painting becoming more routine repetitions of simple motifs. The Italian maiolica industry, largely developed in imitation of the Spanish, was developing in directions where Valencia could or would not follow. That the Italian figurative Renaissance painting was not attempted in Spain is perhaps not surprising, but Valencia only joined the Italians in copying simpler shapes from metalware, the Italians being more ambitious.\n\nThe Reconquista captured Valencia for the third and final time in 1238, and Malaga was one of the last cities to fall, after the Siege of Málaga (1487). The remaining Islamic Mudéjar and converted Morisco populations were expelled from Spain in 1496 and 1609 respectively, the latter Expulsion of the Moriscos involving a third of the population in the province of Valencia. But many of the craftsmen had long been Christians in any case, and the Hispano-Moresque style survived in the province of Valencia, although showing an immediate drop in quality. Later wares usually have a coarse reddish-buff body, dark blue decoration and luster; by now their position as the most prestigious European pottery had been lost to Italian and other producers.\n\nWares continued to be produced in a slow decline, now relying on relatively local demand for tiles and other decorated items, including votive offerings. There were still said to be thirty working kilns at Manises around 1800, by which time the first efforts to revive the industry's former glory had already been made. The secrets of the techniques for making high-quality wares were largely lost, and after Carlos III of Spain took a personal interest a report was commissioned in 1785 to record the methods then being used, lest more was lost. By the 1870s a market had developed for pieces as close to the early work as could be managed, and a number of new firms were set up, some of which continue today, although little original work in the tradition is done.\n\nThe term \"Hispano-Moresque\" is also used to describe figured silk textiles with geometric patterns woven in Al-Andalus, and sometimes to refer to Mudéjar or other work in other media, such as carpets, an industry which followed a similar pattern to pottery in Spain. The Metropolitan Museum of Art uses the term to describe a gilded parade helmet in its collection.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1862447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862447", "title": "Terra preta", "text": "Terra preta\n\nTerra preta (, locally , literally \"black soil\" in Portuguese) is a type of very dark, fertile artificial (anthropogenic) soil found in the Amazon Basin. It is also known as \"Amazonian dark earth\" or \"Indian black earth\". In Portuguese its full name is \"terra preta do índio\" or terra preta de índio (\"black soil of the Indian\", \"Indians' black earth\"). \"Terra mulata\" (\"mulatto earth\") is lighter or brownish in color.\n\"Terra preta\" owes its characteristic black color to its weathered charcoal content, and was made by adding a mixture of charcoal, bone, broken pottery, compost and manure to the low fertility Amazonian soil. A product of indigenous soil management and slash-and-char agriculture, the charcoal is stable and remains in the soil for thousands of years, binding and retaining minerals and nutrients.\n\n\"Terra preta\" is characterized by the presence of low-temperature charcoal residues in high concentrations; of high quantities of tiny pottery shards; of organic matter such as plant residues, animal feces, fish and animal bones, and other material; and of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc and manganese. Fertile soils such as \"terra preta\" show high levels of microorganic activities and other specific characteristics within particular ecosystems.\n\n\"Terra preta\" zones are generally surrounded by \"terra comum\" ( or ), or \"common soil\"; these are infertile soils, mainly acrisols, but also ferralsols and arenosols. Deforested arable soils in the Amazon are productive for a short period of time before their nutrients are consumed or leached away by rain or flooding. This forces farmers to migrate to an unburned area and clear it (by fire). \"Terra preta\" is less prone to nutrient leaching because of its high concentration of charcoal, microbial life and organic matter. The combination accumulates nutrients, minerals and microorganisms and withstands leaching.\n\n\"Terra preta\" soils were created by farming communities between 450 BCE and 950 CE. Soil depths can reach . It is reported to regenerate itself at the rate of per year.\n\nThe origins of the Amazonian dark earths were not immediately clear to later settlers. One idea was that they resulted from ashfall from volcanoes in the Andes, since they occur more frequently on the brows of higher terraces. Another theory considered its formation to be a result of sedimentation in tertiary lakes or in recent ponds.\n\nSoils with elevated charcoal content and a common presence of pottery remains can accrete accidentally near living quarters as residues from food preparation, cooking fires, animal and fish bones, broken pottery, etc., accumulated. Many \"terra preta\" soil structures are now thought to have formed under kitchen middens, as well as being manufactured intentionally on larger scales.\nFarmed areas around living areas are referred to as \"terra mulata\". \"Terra mulata\" soils are more fertile than surrounding soils but less fertile than terra preta, and were most likely intentionally improved using charcoal.\n\nThis type of soil appeared between 450 BCE and 950 CE at sites throughout the Amazon Basin.\n\nAmazonians formed complex, large-scale social formations, including chiefdoms (particularly in the inter-fluvial regions) and even large towns and cities. For instance, the culture on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000. Amazonians may have used \"terra preta\" to make the land suitable for large-scale agriculture.\n\nSpanish explorer Francisco de Orellana was the first European to traverse the Amazon River in the 16th century. He reported densely populated regions extending hundreds of kilometres along the river, suggesting population levels exceeding even those of today. Orellana may have exaggerated the level of development, although that is disputed. The evidence to support his claim comes from the discovery of geoglyphs dating between 0–1250 CE and from \"terra preta\". Beyond the geoglyphs, these populations left no lasting monuments, possibly because they built with wood, which would have rotted in the humid climate, as stone was unavailable.\n\nWhatever its extent, this civilization vanished after the demographic collapse of the 16th and 17th century, due to European-introduced diseases such as smallpox. The settled agrarians again became nomads, while still maintaining specific traditions of their settled forbears. Their semi-nomadic descendants have the distinction among tribal indigenous societies of a hereditary, yet landless, aristocracy, a historical anomaly for a society without a sedentary, agrarian culture.\n\nMoreover, many indigenous peoples adapted to a more mobile lifestyle to escape colonialism. This might have made the benefits of \"terra preta\", such as its self-renewing capacity, less attractive: farmers would not have been able to cultivate the renewed soil as they migrated. Slash-and-char agriculture may have been an adaptation to these conditions. For 350 years after the European arrival, the Portuguese portion of the basin remained untended.\n\n\"Terra preta\" soils are found mainly in the Brazilian Amazon, where Sombroek \"et al.\" estimate that they cover at least 0.1 to 0.3%, or of low forested Amazonia; but others estimate this surface at 10.0% or more (twice the area of Great Britain). Recent model-based predictions suggest that the extent of \"terra preta\" soils may be of 3.2% of the forest.\n\n\"Terra preta\" exists in small plots averaging , but areas of almost have also been reported. They are found among various climatic, geological, and topographical situations. Their distributions either follow main water courses, from East Amazonia to the central basin, or are located on interfluvial sites (mainly of circular or lenticular shape) and of a smaller size averaging some , (see distribution map of \"terra preta\" sites in Amazon basin The spreads of tropical forest between the savannas could be mainly anthropogenic—a notion with dramatic implications worldwide for agriculture and conservation.\n\n\"Terra preta\" sites are also known in Ecuador, Peru and French Guiana, and on the African continent in Benin, Liberia, and the South African savannas.\n\nIn the international soil classification system World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) \"Terra preta\" is called Pretic Anthrosol. The most common original soil before transformed into a terra preta is the Ferralsol. Terra preta has a carbon content ranging from high to very high (more than 13–14% organic matter) in its A horizon, but without hydromorphic characteristics. \"Terra preta\" presents important variants. For instance, gardens close to dwellings received more nutrients than fields farther away. The variations in Amazonian dark earths prevent clearly determining whether all of them were intentionally created for soil improvement or whether the lightest variants are a by-product of habitation.\n\n\"Terra preta\"'s capacity to increase its own volume—thus to sequester more carbon—was first documented by pedologist William I. Woods of the University of Kansas. This remains the central mystery of terra preta.\n\nThe processes responsible for the formation of \"terra preta\" soils are:\n\n\nThe transformation of biomass into charcoal produces a series of charcoal derivatives known as pyrogenic or black carbon, the composition of which varies from lightly charred organic matter, to soot particles rich in graphite formed by recomposition of free radicals.\n\nIndigenous people added low temperature charcoal to poor soils. Up to 9% black carbon has been measured in some \"terra preta\" (against 0.5% in surrounding soils). Other measurements found carbon levels 70 times greater than in surrounding ferralsols, with approximate average values of 50 Mg/ha/m.\n\nThe chemical structure of charcoal in \"terra preta\" soils is characterized by poly-condensed aromatic groups that provide prolonged biological and chemical stability against microbial degradation; it also provides, after partial oxidation, the highest nutrient retention. Low temperature charcoal (but not that from grasses or high cellulose materials) has an internal layer of biological petroleum condensates that the bacteria consume, and is similar to cellulose in its effects on microbial growth. Charring at high temperature consumes that layer and brings little increase in soil fertility. The formation of condensed aromatic structures depends on the method of manufacture of charcoal. The slow oxidation of charcoal creates carboxylic groups; these increase the cations' exchange capacity of the soil. The nucleus of black carbon particles produced by the biomass remains aromatic even after thousands of years and presents the spectral characteristics of fresh charcoal. Around that nucleus and on the surface of the black carbon particles are higher proportions of forms of carboxylic and phenolic carbons spatially and structurally distinct from the particle's nucleus. Analysis of the groups of molecules provides evidences both for the oxidation of the black carbon particle itself, as well as for the adsorption of non-black carbon.\n\nThis charcoal is thus decisive for the sustainability of \"terra preta\". Amending ferralsol with wood charcoal greatly increases productivity. Globally, agricultural lands have lost on average 50% of their carbon due to intensive cultivation and other damage of human origin.\n\nFresh charcoal must be \"charged\" before it can function as a biotope. Several experiments demonstrate that uncharged charcoal can bring a provisional depletion of available nutrients when first put into the soil, that is until its pores fill with nutrients. This is overcome by soaking the charcoal for two to four weeks in any liquid nutrient (urine, plant tea, etc.).\n\nBiochar is charcoal produced at relatively low temperatures from a biomass of wood and leafy plant materials in an environment with very low or no oxygen. Amending soil with biochar has been observed to increase the activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Tests of high porosity materials such as zeolite, activated carbon and charcoal show that microbial growth substantially improves with charcoal. It may be that small pieces of charcoal migrate within the soil, providing a habitat for bacteria that decompose the biomass in the surface ground cover. This process may have an essential role in \"terra preta\"'s self-propagation; a virtuous cycle develops as the fungus spreads from the charcoal, fixing additional carbon, stabilizing the soil with glomalin and increasing nutrient availability for nearby plants. Many other agents contribute, from earthworms to humans as well as the charring process.\n\nShould biochar become widely used for soil improvement, a side-effect would produce globally significant amounts of carbon sequestration, helping mediate global warming. \"Bio-char soil management systems can deliver tradable C emissions reduction, and C sequestered is easily accountable, and verifiable.\"\n\nBiochar is shown to increase soil cation exchange capacity, leading to improved plant nutrient uptake. Along with this it was particularly useful in acidic tropical soils as it is capable of raising pH due to its slightly alkaline nature. Biochar shows that, in relation to a soil, productivity of oxidised residue is particularly stable, abundant and capable of increasing soil fertility levels.\n\nThe stability of biochar compared to other forms of charcoal is due to its formation. The process of burning organic material at high temperatures and low oxygen levels results in a porous char-rich and ash-poor product. Biochar has potential to be a nutrient-dense long-term contributor to soil fertility.\n\nCharcoal's porosity brings better retention of organic matter, of water and of dissolved nutrients, as well as of pollutants such as pesticides and aromatic poly-cyclic hydrocarbons.\n\nCharcoal's high absorption potential of organic molecules (and of water) is due to its porous structure. \"Terra preta\"'s high concentration of charcoal supports a high concentration of organic matter (on average three times more than in the surrounding poor soils), up to 150 g/kg. Organic matter can be found at deep.\n\nBechtold proposes to use \"terra preta\" for soils that show, at depth, a minimum proportion of organic matter over 2.0-2.5%. The accumulation of organic matter in moist tropical soils is a paradox, because of optimum conditions for organic matter degradation. It is remarkable that anthrosols regenerate in spite of these tropical conditions' prevalence and their fast mineralisation rates. The stability of organic matter is mainly because the biomass is only partially consumed.\n\n\"Terra preta\" soils also show higher quantities of nutrients, and a better retention of these nutrients, than surrounding infertile soils. The proportion of P reaches 200–400 mg/kg. The quantity of N is also higher in anthrosol, but that nutrient is immobilized because of the high proportion of C over N in the soil.\n\nAnthrosol's availability of P, Ca, Mn and Zn is higher than ferrasol. The absorption of P, K, Ca, Zn, and Cu by the plants increases when the quantity of available charcoal increases. The production of biomass for two crops (rice and \"Vigna unguiculata\") increased by 38–45% without fertilization (P < 0.05), compared to crops on fertilized ferralsol.\n\nAmending with charcoal pieces approximately in diameter, instead of ground charcoal, did not change the results except for manganese (Mn), for which absorption considerably increased.\n\nNutrient leaching is minimal in this anthrosol, despite their abundance, resulting in high fertility. When inorganic nutrients are applied to the soil, however, the nutrients' drainage in anthrosol exceeds that in fertilized ferralsol.\n\nAs potential sources of nutrients, only C (via photosynthesis) and N (from biological fixation) can be produced \"in situ\". All the other elements (P, K, Ca, Mg, etc.) must be present in the soil. In Amazonia, the provisioning of nutrients from the decomposition of naturally available organic matter fails as the heavy rainfalls wash away the released nutrients and the natural soils (ferralsols, acrisols, lixisols, arenosols, uxisols, etc.) lack the mineral matter to provide those nutrients. The clay matter that exists in those soils is capable of holding only a small fraction of the nutrients made available from decomposition. In the case of \"terra preta\", the only possible nutrient sources are primary and secondary. The following components have been found:\n\n\nSaturation in pH and in base is more important than in the surrounding soils.\n\nBacteria and fungi (myco-organisms) live and die within the porous media of charcoal, thus increasing its carbon content.\n\nSignificant biological black carbon production has been identified, especially under moist tropical conditions. It is possible that the fungus \"Aspergillus niger\" is mainly responsible.\n\nThe peregrine earthworm \"Pontoscolex corethrurus\" (Oligochaeta: Glossoscolecidae) ingests charcoal and mixes it into a finely ground form with the mineral soil. \"P. corethrurus\" is widespread in Amazonia and notably in clearings after burning processes thanks to its tolerance of a low content of organic matter in the soil. This as an essential element in the generation of \"terra preta\", associated with agronomic knowledge involving layering the charcoal in thin regular layers favorable to its burying by \"P. corethrurus\".\n\nSome ants are repelled from fresh terra preta; their density is found to be low about 10 days after production compared to that in control soils.\n\nA newly coined term is ‘synthetic \"terra preta\"’. STP is a fertilizer consisting of materials thought to replicate the original materials, including crushed clay, blood and bone meal, manure and biochar is of particulate nature and capable of moving down the soil profile and improving soil fertility and carbon in the current soil peds and aggregates over a viable time frame. Such a mixture provides multiple soil improvements reaching at least the quality of \"terra mulata\". Blood, bone meal and chicken manure are useful for short term organic manure addition. Perhaps the most important and unique part of the improvement of soil fertility is carbon, thought to have been gradually incorporated 4 to 10 thousand years ago. Biochar is capable of decreasing soil acidity and if soaked in nutrient rich liquid can slowly release nutrients and provide habitat for microbes in soil due to its high porosity surface area.\n\nThe goal is an economically viable process that could be included in modern agriculture. Average poor tropical soils are easily enrichable to \"terra preta nova\" by the addition of charcoal and condensed smoke. \"Terra preta\" may be an important avenue of future carbon sequestration while reversing the current worldwide decline in soil fertility and associated desertification. Whether this is possible on a larger scale has yet to be proven. Tree Lucerne (tagasaste or \"Cytisus proliferus\") is one type of fertilizer tree used to make \"terra preta\". Efforts to recreate these soils are underway by companies such as Embrapa and other organizations in Brazil.\n\nSynthetic \"terra preta\" is produced at the Sachamama Center for Biocultural Regeneration in High Amazon, Peru. This area has many \"terra preta\" soil zones, demonstrating that this anthrosol was created not only in the Amazon basin, but also at higher elevations.\n\nA synthetic \"terra preta\" process was developed by Alfons-Eduard Krieger to produce a high humus, nutrient-rich, water-adsorbing soil.\n\n\"Terra preta\" sanitation (TPS) systems have been studied as an alternative sanitation option by using the effects of lactic-aid conditions in urine-diverting dry toilets and a subsequent treatment by vermicomposting.\n\n\n"}

His books include \"\" (Broadway Books, 2002), \"2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl\" (Tarcher/Penguin, 2006), and \"Notes from the Edge Times\" (Tarcher/Penguin, 2010). He is a co-founder of the web magazine \"Reality Sandwich\" and of the website Evolver.net, and edited the North Atlantic Books publishing imprint Evolver Editions. He was featured in the 2010 documentary \"2012: Time for Change\", directed by Joao Amorim and produced by Mangusta Films. He is the founder of the think tank Center for Planetary Culture, which produced the Regenerative Society Wiki.\n\nPinchbeck’s father, Peter Pinchbeck, was an abstract painter, and his mother, writer and editor Joyce Johnson, was a member of the Beat Generation who dated Jack Kerouac as \"On the Road\" at the time was published in 1957 (chronicled in Johnson's book, \"Minor Characters \").\n\nPinchbeck was a founder of the 1990s literary magazine \"Open City\" with fellow writers Thomas Beller and Robert Bingham. He has written for many publications, including \"Esquire\", \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"The Village Voice\", and \"Rolling Stone\". In 1994 he was chosen by \"The New York Times Magazine\" as one of \"Thirty Under Thirty\" destined to change our culture through his work with \"Open City\". He has been a regular columnist for a number of magazines, including \"Dazed & Confused\".\n\nIn \"Breaking Open the Head\", Pinchbeck explored shamanism via ceremonies with tribal groups such as the Bwiti of Gabon, who eat iboga, and the Secoya people in the Ecuadorean Amazon, who take the psychedelic tryptamine brew ayahuasca in their ceremonies. He also attended the Burning Man festival in Nevada, and looked at use of psychedelic substances in a de-sacralized modern context. Philosophically influenced by the work of anthroposophist Rudolf Steiner, through his direct experience and research Pinchbeck developed the hypothesis that shamanic and mystical views of reality have validity, and that the modern world had forfeited an understanding of intuitive aspects of being in its pursuit of rational materialism.\n\nDrawing heavily, and somewhat controversially, from material shared on the Breaking Open the Head forums, Pinchbeck's second volume, \"2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl\", chronicles Mayan and Hopi prophecies, and follows Pinchbeck's travels and travails as he responds to leads, both physical and intellectual, he receives via this forum. Examining the nature of prophecy during this period, Pinchbeck investigates the New Age hypothesis of Terence McKenna that humanity is experiencing an accelerated process of global consciousness transformation, leading to a new understanding of time and space. The book details the psi or extra-sensory perception research of Dean Radin, the theories of Terence McKenna, the phenomena of crop circles, and a visit to calendar reform advocate José Argüelles. Pinchbeck concludes with an account of receiving a transmission of prophetic material from the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl. This claim was enough to get the book dropped by its planned publisher, delaying its release for the greater part of a year. While acknowledging that the validity of such an experience is unknown, Pinchbeck describes how a voice identifying itself as Quetzalcoatl began speaking to him during a 2004 trip to the Amazon. At the time, he was participating in the ceremonies of Santo Daime, a Brazilian religion that includes sacramental use of ayahuasca. Through its references to 2012 and the Maya calendar in the context of New Age beliefs, Pinchbeck's book has contributed to Mayanism.\n\nIn May 2007, Pinchbeck launched \"Reality Sandwich\". He is the executive producer of Postmodern Times, a series of web videos presented on the iClips Network, and co-founder of Evolver.net, an online social network. His life and work are featured in the documentary \"2012: Time for Change\", featuring interviews with Sting, David Lynch, Barbara Marx Hubbard, and others.\n\nIn August 2013, Pinchbeck became the host of \"Mind Shift\", a new talk show, filmed in New York City, produced by Gaiam TV.\n\nPinchbeck's \"How Soon Is Now?\" (2017) explores the idea that the ecological crisis is a rite of passage or initiation for humanity collectively, forcing us to reach the next level of our consciousness as a species. The book outlines the changes to our technical infrastructure - agriculture, energy, industry - and our social, political, and economic system that Pinchbeck believes necessary to avoid the worst consequences of global warming and species extinction.\n\nOn October 22, 2017, Pinchbeck published a lengthy essay on Facebook that responded to accusations that he is a sexual predator that emerged through the #metoo movement. Pinchbeck conceded to many of the things he was accused of and sought to explain them in terms of his childhood traumas.\n\nIn a 1973 article about the \"Wacky Packs\" parodies of consumer packaging, seven-year-old Pinchbeck told a reporter for \"New York Magazine\", \"I think they're bringing out the truth about foods.\"\n\nOn 14 December 2006, Pinchbeck appeared on the television program \"The Colbert Report\" to discuss his book, \"2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl\".\n\nPinchbeck was featured in the 2006 video \"Entheogen: Awakening the Divine Within\", a documentary about rediscovering an enchanted cosmos in the modern world.\n\nPinchbeck was also featured in the 2008 video \"2012: Science or Superstition\", a documentary describing how much of what we are hearing is science and how much is superstition.\n\nHe interviewed Alejandro Jodorowsky for the German/French art television network Arte in a very personal discussion, spending a night together in France, continuing the interview in different locations like in a park and in a hotel.\n\nPinchbeck appears in the documentary film \"\", directed by João G. Amorim, which was released in October 2010.\nHe also appeared in the documentary film \"Electronic Awakening\", directed by AC Johner, released in 2011.\n\nPinchbeck appeared on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, recorded on 8 September 2011.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1862461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862461", "title": "Heavy machine gun", "text": "Heavy machine gun\n\nA heavy machine gun or HMG is a class of machine gun implying greater characteristics than general purpose or medium machine guns.\n\nThere are two generally recognized classes of weapons identified as heavy machine guns. The first are weapons from World War I identified as \"heavy\" due to the weight and encumbrance of the weapons themselves. The second are large-caliber (12.7x99mm, 12.7×108mm, 14.5×114mm, or larger) machine guns, pioneered by John Browning with the M2 machine gun, designed to provide increased range, penetration and destructive power against vehicles, buildings, aircraft and light fortifications beyond the standard rifle calibers used in medium or general-purpose machine guns, or the intermediate cartridges used in light machine guns.\n\nThe term was originally used to refer to the generation of machine guns which came into widespread use in World War I. These fired standard rifle cartridges such as the 7.92 Mauser, .303 British or 7.62×54mmR, but featured heavy construction, elaborate mountings, and water-cooling mechanisms that enabled long-range sustained automatic fire with excellent accuracy. However, these advantages came at the cost of being too cumbersome to move quickly, as well as requiring a crew of several soldiers to operate them. Thus, in this sense, the \"heavy\" aspect of the weapon referred to the weapon's bulk and ability to sustain fire, not the cartridge caliber. This class of weapons was best exemplified by the Maxim gun, invented by the American inventor Hiram Maxim, who had traveled to England to market his design and became a British subject in 1900. The Maxim was the most ubiquitous machine gun of World War I, variants of which were fielded simultaneously by three separate warring nations (Germany with the MG 08, Britain with the Vickers, and Russia with the PM M1910).\nThe modern definition refers to a class of large-caliber (generally .50 or 12.7mm) machine guns, pioneered by John Moses Browning with the M2 machine gun. These weapons are designed to provide increased range, penetration and destructive power against vehicles, buildings, aircraft and light fortifications beyond the standard rifle calibers used in medium or general-purpose machine gun, or the intermediate cartridges used in light machine guns. In this sense, the \"heavy\" aspect of the weapon refers to its superior power and range over light- and medium-caliber weapons, in addition to its weight. This class of machine gun came into widespread use during World War II, when the M2 was used widely in fortifications, on vehicles and in aircraft by American forces. A similar HMG capacity was later fielded by the Soviets in the form of Vasily Degtyaryov's DShK in 12.7×108mm. The ubiquitous German MG42 general-purpose machine gun, though well-suited against infantry, lacked the M2's anti-fortification and anti-vehicle capability, a fact that was noted and lamented by the Germans. The continued need for a longer-range machine gun with anti-materiel capability to bridge the gap between exclusively anti-infantry weapons and exclusively anti-materiel weapons has led to the widespread adoption and modernization of the class, and most nations' armed forces are equipped with some type of HMG.\n\nCurrently, machine guns with calibers smaller than 10mm are generally considered medium or light machine guns, while those larger than 15mm are generally classified as autocannons instead of heavy machine guns.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Gatling guns and other externally powered types such as the Nordenfelt were often made in a variety of calibers, such as 0.5-inch and 1-inch. Due to their multiple barrels, overheating was not so much of an issue, but they were also quite heavy.\n\nWhen Maxim developed his recoil-powered machine gun using a single barrel, his first main design weighed a modest 26 pounds (11.8 kg) and fired a .45-inch rifle-caliber bullet from a 24-inch barrel. A famous photo of Maxim showed him picking it up by its 15-pound tripod (6.8 kg) with one arm. It was similar to present-day medium machine guns, but it could not be fired for extended periods due to overheating. As a result, Maxim created a water jacket cooling system to enable it to fire for extended periods. However, this added significant weight, as did the change to more powerful rifle cartridges.\n\nThere were thus two main types of heavy, rapid-fire weapons: the manually powered, multiple-barrel machine guns and the single-barrel Maxim guns. By the end of the 19th century, many new designs such as the M1895 Colt–Browning and Hotchkiss were developed, powered by gas operation or recoil operation. Also, rather than the heavy water jacket, new designs introduced other types of barrel cooling, such as barrel replacement, metal fins, heat sinks or some combination of these.\n\nMachine guns diverged into heavier and lighter designs. The later model water-cooled Maxim guns and its derivatives the MG 08 and the Vickers, as well as the American M1917 Browning machine gun, were all substantial weapons. The .303 Vickers, for example, weighed 33 lb (15 kg) and was mounted on a tripod that brought the total weight to 50 lb (23 kg). The heavier designs could, and in some cases did, fire for days on end, mainly in fixed defensive positions to repel infantry attacks. These machine guns were typically mounted on tripods and were water-cooled, and a well-trained crew could fire nonstop for hours, given sufficient ammunition, replacement barrels and cooling water. Carefully positioned heavy machine guns could stop an attacking force before they reached their objectives.\n\nHowever, during the same period a number of lighter and more portable air-cooled designs were developed weighing less than 30 lbs (15 kg). In World War I they were to be as important as the heavier designs, and were used to support infantry on the attack, on aircraft, and on many types of vehicles.\n\nThe lightest of the new designs were not capable of sustained automatic fire, as they did not have water jackets and were fed from comparatively small magazines. Essentially machine rifles with a bipod, weapons like the Lewis Gun, Chauchat and the Madsen were portable by one soldier, but were made for single and burst fire.\n\nThe medium designs offered greater flexibility, either being fitted with a bipod in the light machine gun role or on a tripod or other weapon mount as medium machine guns. An example was the Hotchkiss M1909 machine gun weighing 27.6 lb (12.2 kg) fitted with a mini-tripod and using linkable 30-round ammunition strips, but there was also a belt-fed version.\n\nThis type of multipurpose machine gun would be further developed, and later given names such as \"universal machine gun\", and later \"general-purpose machine gun\", and would eventually supplant the water-cooled designs. These later designs used quick-change barrel replacement to reduce overheating, which further reduced the weapon's weight, but at the cost of increasing the soldier's load due to the extra barrels. Some earlier designs like the Vickers had this feature, but it was mainly for barrel wear, as they normally used water cooling. It was in the 1920s and 1930s that quick barrel replacement for cooling purposes became more popular in weapons such as the ZB vz. 30, the Bren, the MG34 and the MG42.\n\nThe heavier designs continued to be used throughout World War II and into the 1960s, but were gradually phased out in favor of air-cooled designs. The mediums were now used both as medium machine guns while mounted on tripods and as light machine guns while mounted on bipods. This was possible in part because a heavy, static MG position was not a very effective tactic in vehicle-centered warfare, and the significantly lighter air-cooled designs could nearly match the capabilities of the water-cooled versions.\n\nGatling-type machine guns such as the Minigun and GShG-7.62 reappeared after World War II. These are typically mounted on ships and helicopters because of their weight and large ammunition requirements (due to their extremely high rate of fire.) The need for sustained automatic fire on the ground, however, is now nearly entirely filled by air-cooled medium machine guns.\n\n\n"}

It produces 27–28 TWh of electricity per year, or 20% of the total power generation in Poland. The power station is owned and operated by PGE GiEK Oddział Elektrownia Bełchatów, a subsidiary of Polska Grupa Energetyczna.\nIn 2011, a new 858 MW unit was commissioned and the total capacity of the power has risen to 5,053 MW. The new unit has an efficiency rating of approximately 42%, which is contributing to reduction of both fuel consumption and emissions compared to the existing units. The unit was built by Alstom. Alstom has also carried out the modernization of the low pressure parts in all 12 turbines and, on 8 April 2009, PGE and Alstom signed a contract to modernise unit 6. After modernization of other units, the total installed capacity reached 5,420 MW in September 2015. In March 2017, the electrical capacity of Elektrownia Bełchatow was increased to 5,472 MW. The plant's current achievable capacity is 5,102 MW.

Ramachandran to help alleviate phantom limb pain, in which patients feel they still have a limb after having it amputated. The wider use of mirrors in this way is known as mirror therapy or mirror visual feedback (MVF).\n\nIn a mirror box the patient places the good limb into one side, and the residual limb into the other. The patient then looks into the mirror on the side with the good limb and makes \"mirror symmetric\" movements, as a symphony conductor might, or as a person does when they clap their hands. Because the subject is seeing the reflected image of the good hand moving, it appears as if the phantom limb is also moving. Through the use of this artificial visual feedback it becomes possible for the patient to \"move\" the phantom limb, and to unclench it from potentially painful positions.\n\nMirror therapy has expanded beyond its origin in treating phantom limb pain to treatment of other kinds of one-sided pain, for instance in stroke patients suffering from hemiparesis and limb pain in patients with chronic regional pain syndrome.\n\nBased on the observation that phantom limb patients were much more likely to report paralyzed and painful phantoms if the actual limb had been paralyzed prior to amputation (for example, due to a brachial plexus avulsion), Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran proposed the \"learned paralysis\" hypothesis of painful phantom limbs Their hypothesis was that every time the patient attempted to move the paralyzed limb, they received sensory feedback (through vision and proprioception) that the limb did not move. This feedback stamped itself into the brain circuitry through a process of Hebbian learning, so that, even when the limb was no longer present, the brain had learned that the limb (and subsequent phantom) was paralyzed.\n\nRamachandran created the mirror box to relieve pain by helping an amputee imagine motor control over a missing limb. Mirror therapy is now also widely used for treatment of motor disorders such as hemiplegia or cerebral palsy. As Deconick et al. state in a 2014 review, the mechanism of improved motor control and pain relief may differ from the mechanism of pain relief. Deconick et al., who reviewed only the effects of MVF on sensorimotor control, found that MVF can exert a strong influence on the motor network, mainly through increased cognitive penetration in action control. \n\nDespite considerable research, as of 2016 the underlying neural mechanisms of mirror therapy (MT) are still unclear.\n\nAlthough there has been much research on MVT, authors of many review articles complain about the poor methodology often used, for example, small sample sizes or lack of control groups. For this reason, one 2016 review (based on a review of 8 studies) concluded that the level of evidence was insufficient to recommend MT as a first intention treatment for phantom limb pain. \n\nA 2018 review, (based on 15 studies conducted between 2012 and 2017, out of a pool of 115 publications) also criticized the quality of many reports on mirror therapy (MT), but concluded that \"MT seems to be effective in relieving PLP, reducing the intensity and duration of daily pain episodes. It is a valid, simple, and inexpensive treatment for PLP.\" \n\nTreatment with mirror therapy has expanded beyond its origin in treating phantom limb pain to treatment of other kinds of one-sided pain and loss of motor control, for example in stroke patients suffering from hemiparesis. A review article published in 2016 concluded that \"Mirror therapy (MT) is a valuable method for enhancing motor recovery in poststroke hemiparesis.\" A 2018 review based on 1685 patients recovering from hemiplegic stroke found mirror therapy provided significant pain relief, while improving motor functions and activities of daily living (ADL). \n\nMirror therapy is also a recommended therapy for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).\n\nThe effectiveness of mirror therapy continues to be evaluated.\n\nSince the 2000s, mirror therapy has also been available through virtual reality or robotics. So far, these expensive technologies have not proven to be more effective than conventional mirror boxes.\n\n\n"}

He had a brother, Ákos. A maternal relative was the photographer László Moholy-Nagy, and another was the conductor Georg Solti. He started to play the piano at age five, and later took piano lessons. At the age of 11, he wrote his first opera, \"Christmas in the Trenches\". After completing his education at the Gymnasium Franz-Josef, he attended the Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied with Leo Weiner. He also studied with Béla Bartók at the Liszt Academy, receiving diplomas in composition and conducting. He won a grant to study in Berlin in 1928, where he met Lilli Apel, another musician, whom he later married. Kosma also met and studied with Hanns Eisler in Berlin. He became acquainted with Bertolt Brecht and Helene Weigel.\n\nKosma and his wife emigrated to Paris in 1933. Eventually, he met Jacques Prévert, who introduced him to Jean Renoir. During the 1930s Kosma teamed up with Prévert to set a number of Prévert's poems to music, and have them recorded by popular singers. Several of these were hits. Kosma also composed scores to Renoir's films including \"La Grande Illusion\" (1937), \"La Bête Humaine\" (\"The Human Beast\", 1938), and \"La Règle du jeu\" (\"The Rules of the Game\", 1939).\n\nDuring World War II and the Occupation of France, Kosma was placed under house arrest in the Alpes-Maritimes region and was banned from composition. However, Prévert managed to arrange for Kosma to contribute music for films with other composers fronting for him. Under this arrangement, he wrote the \"pantomime\" of the music for \"Les Enfants du Paradis\" (1945), made under the occupation but released after the liberation. Among his other credits are the scores to \"Voyage Surprise\" (1946) and \"Le Testament du docteur Cordelier\" (\"The Doctor's Horrible Experiment\", 1959), the last of which was made for television. He was also known for writing the standard classical-jazz piece \"Les feuilles mortes\" (\"Autumn Leaves\"), with French lyrics by Prévert and later English lyrics by Johnny Mercer, which was derived from music in Marcel Carné's film \"Les Portes de la Nuit\" (1946). The song was featured in the eponymous 1956 film starring Joan Crawford.\n"}
{"id": "1862510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862510", "title": "Nea Anchialos", "text": "Nea Anchialos\n\nNea Anchialos () is a town and a former municipality in Magnesia, Thessaly, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Volos, of which it is a municipal unit. It is situated southwest of Volos and north of Almyros, on the coast of the Pagasetic Gulf. It is located on the national highway Athens-Lamia-Volos. The area of the municipal unit is and its population 6,819 people (2011).\nThe modern town is built on the ruins of the ancient city of Pyrasos (Πύρασος), and is associated with the nearby city of Thessalian or Phthiotic Thebes, near the modern village of Mikrothivai.\n\nHomer mentions Pyrasos in his list of ships (\"Iliad\" B.695) together with Phylace and Itona, which belonged to the kingdom of Protesilaus. According to Strabo (IX.435), who discusses its topography, \"well-harboured Pyrasos\" (εὑλίμενος Πύρασος) was 20 \"stadia\" from Phthiotic Thebes.\n\nPyrasos is scarcely known from historical sources, except that it was an active harbour and featured a famous temple of Demeter and Kore, after which the harbour was later known as Demetrion. The only excavation which took place on the hill of Magoula, the old acropolis, southeast of Nea Anchialos, proves that the site was peopled since the earliest Neolithic period (6th millennium BC) by fishermen and agriculturalists. Archaeologically, the remains of Pyrasos are scant, and the city is barely known in historical times. An arm from an oversized statue, which came into light in 1965, was attributed to Demeter. Possibly the most identical finding is a small fragment of an ancient epigraph, discovered in the debris of the big Basilica D with the name Pyrasos, confirming the location of the city.\n\nIn the late 4th century BC, Pyrasos was joined (synoecism) with the neighbouring cities of Phylake and Phthiotic Thebes. The new conurbation took the name of Phthiotic or Thessalian Thebes. The city remained prosperous under Roman rule, but it was moved from the inland site of the old Phthiotic Thebes back to Pyrasos near the sea. The city's prosperity from the 4th through the 6th centuries is attested by the number of its Early Christian monuments, but was brought to an end in a great fire in the late 7th century that destroyed the city. The city was rebuilt and apparently continued to be of some note in the early Byzantine period—its bishop is last mentioned in the 8th/9th century—but never recovered and was eventually eclipsed by the nearby port city of Halmyros.\n\nNea Anchialos was founded in 1906 by Greeks who fled the Black Sea town of Anchialos (modern Pomorie in Bulgaria) after massive anti-Greek riots, provoked by the Greek-Bulgarian struggle in Macedonia.\n\n"}

Its inhabitants are called \"Saintaises\" and \"Saintais\". Saintes is the second-largest city in Charente-Maritime, with inhabitants in 2008. The city's immediate surroundings form the second-most populous metropolitan area in the department, with inhabitants. While a majority of the surrounding landscape consists of fertile, productive fields, a significant minority of the region remains forested; its natural state.\n\nIn Roman times, Saintes was known as \"Mediolanum Santonum\", and during much of its history, the name of the city was spelled Xaintes and Xainctes.\n\nPrimarily built on the left bank of the Charente, Saintes became the first Roman capital of Aquitaine, and later, the capital of the province of Saintonge under the Ancien Régime. Following the French Revolution it briefly became the prefecture of the department (then called \"Charente-Inférieure\") during the territorial reorganization of 1790, until La Rochelle took its place in 1810. Even though it was but a subprefecture, Saintes was allowed to remain the judicial center of the department. In the late 19th century, Saintes was chosen as the seat of the VIIIth \"arrondissement\" of the Chemins de Fer de l'État, railways, which enabled an era of economic and demographic growth.\n\nToday, Saintes remains the economic heart of the center of the department and it is an important transportation hub. A few major industrial business operate (in electronics, rail repair, construction of hoists). The city's commerce and service sector is large with the headquarters of Coop Atlantique, administrative functions of state, courts, legal services, banks, schools and a hospital. Beyond this, property maintenance, retail and tourism sectors provide large numbers of jobs.\n\nBecause of its noteworthy Gallo-Roman, medieval and classical heritage, Saintes is a tourist destination and a member of the French Towns and Lands of Art and History since 1990. It has several museums, a theater, cinemas, and organizes numerous festivals. A European center of musical research and practice is in its Abbaye aux Dames.\n\nSaintes is on the banks of the Charente River, in the center-eastern part of the department. The city is centred 60 km southeast of La Rochelle, 33 kilometers northeast of Royan and about 100 km north of Bordeaux (to which it is linked by the A10 autoroute).\n\nA chronostratigraphic stage of sedimentary rock (in stratigraphy) has been named after the former name for inhabitants, the Santones, the Santonian (approximately 84 Ma ago, after the Coniacian Age and before the Campanian Age in the Cretaceous Period). Saintes is built on its eponymous subset of mainly limestone that consists of particular flint nodules of quartz geodes and nodules of iron. Ancient stone quarries in its 'Colline de la Capitole' (Capitol Hill) and Bellevue, partially filled or converted to permit fungiculture, are evidence for Santonian stone's use in the construction of various buildings, where unimproved quite vulnerable to frost.\n\nNearer to the river, the Cretaceous plateau gives way to more or less recent alluvial grasslands composed of \"bri\", a type of clay.\n\nThe uplifting of Alps and Pyrenees began during the Maastrichtian, 65 Ma ago, and continued for a part of the Paleogene.\n\nThe town is divided into 14 administrative areas : Les Boiffiers, Les Tourneurs, L'Ormeau de Pied, Recouvrance, La Fenêtre, Saint-Rémy, Saint-Vivien, Saint-Eutrope, Saint-Pierre, Saint-Pallais, Saint-Sébastien de Bouard, La Récluse, Le Maine-Saint-Sorlin and Bellevue.\n\nThe neighborhood of Saint-Pierre lies between the hill of the Capitole and the river Charente. It possesses a significant number of historic monuments justifying its forming of the core of a conservation area that spans over . Built around the cathedral Saint-Pierre, the \"place du marché\" and the \"place du Synode\", it is crossed by pedestrian alleys around which can be found numerous medieval, renaissance and classic buildings.\n\nAlmost immediately west lies the neighbourhood of Saint-Eutrope, that has developed over the centuries around a rocky elevation bounded by two small valleys at right angles to the river. Dominated by the Saint-Eutrope basilica, it also contains the remains of a Clunian priory and several hillside houses. Little valleys lead to the \"vallon des Arènes\" (meaning arenas vale) below, where a Roman amphiteatre survives, in a park named \"\"Parc des Arènes\"\".\n\nThe \"cours Reverseaux\" and \"cours des Apôtres de la liberté\" separate Saint-Eutrope (and its hill) in the west from the \"faubourg Berthonnière\". These partly separate the hill of the Capitole to the north. Once outside-of-the-walls, the faubourg included some hostelries and inns for pilgrims. The streets of the \"faubourg\" converge toward the \"place Saint-Louis\", the \"place de l'Aubarrée\" and the \"place Blair\", dominated by a column of Liberty (in France popularised as fictional Marianne at the time) erected during the Revolution. The \"square Goulebenéze\" stands between the \"place Blair\" and the river.\n\nThe neighbourhoods of \"les Boiffiers\" and \"Bellevue\" are separated from the rest of the city by the \"avenue de Saintonge\"; they consist mainly in low-rent housing (HLM) and suburban housing standing on a plateau bounded by the Charente. Bellevue has inhabitants and spans ; it is listed as a zone urbaine sensible (ZUS).\n\nLa Recouvrance, in a triangle formed by the \"cours du maréchal Leclerc\", the \"cours Genet\" and the \"rocade ouest\" (bypass), contains a lycée, the former seminary, the Yvon Chevalier stadium and a shopping mall. The water tower of Recouvrance is decorated with frescoes by contemporary artist Michel Genty.\n\nThe north of the urban area, the Saint-Vivien neighborhood has an old faubourg (exurb) inhabited since antiquity where the \"thermes de Saint-Saloine\", ancient Roman baths are found.\n\nThe neighborhood of Saint-Pallais was probably urbanized in antiquity. Structured around the main access way of the Roman city, it was then linked to the town center by a bridge with a monumental entrance, the Arch of Germanicus. During the Middle Ages, a funeral basilica, dedicated to the bishop Palladius, was established (and later replaced by the église Saint-Pallais, which gives its name to the neighborhood), then a Benedictine abbey of women amongst the largest in the region, the Abbaye aux Dames de Saintes. The presence of this monumental heritage led to the integration of part of the neighborhood in a conservation area. It was during the 19th century that the neighborhood began to develop. The antique bridge was destroyed and replaced in 1879 by the \"pont Bernard-Palissy\", a few meters upstream ; the \"avenue Gambetta\" and the \"place Bassompierre\" are created ; the train station, the Gare de Saintes, the prison, the Haras national de Saintes, the \"parc Pierre-Mendès France\", the \"Jardin public Fernand Chapsal\" and the protected area of the \"prairie de la Palu\" were subsequently created.\n\nSaintes is a transportation hub of some importance, connected by two motorways and several secondary roads, national and departmental, that converge towards the \"rocade\" (partly a 2x2) that bypasses the city on its western and southern sides.\n\nThe A10 autoroute (France), operated locally by Autoroutes du Sud de la France, passes through the commune in its western part, in a north-south axis. It can be accessed by the interchange 35. By the A10, Saintes is 125 km from Bordeaux, 140 km from Poitiers, 470 km from Paris.\n\nThe A837 autoroute is a spur road of the A10 linking the area to Rochefort, the third city in the department.\n\nSaintes is on the Route Centre-Europe Atlantique, an expressway that links it to Limoges and Lyon in the east — its dualled western section Saintes-Saujon opened to traffic in 2008 making the two 25 minutes apart by car. An extension towards Royan on the coast completed in the following decade.\n\nThe \"rocade\" is formed in its western part by the national road 137, that meets two key roads, the departmental road 728 (that links Saintes to the Island of Oleron by Marennes) and the departmental road 150 that intersects near the locality of Diconche. In its southern part, the rocade integrates the national road 141, that runs east towards Cognac, Angoulême and Limoges. The departmental road 150, at the end of the east part, runs towards Niort by Saint-Hilaire-de-Villefranche et Saint-Jean-d'Angély. The town center of Saintes is bypassed by the \"avenue de Saintonge\" or departmental road 24, that crosses the Charente with the bridge de Saintonge, opened in 1969.\n\nThe Gare de Saintes (train station) is at the focal point of five railways that link the agglomeration to Nantes (by La Rochelle), Bordeaux, Angoulême, Niort and Royan ; the trains are mainly part of the regional rail network TER Nouvelle-Aquitaine and the network Intercités.\n\nIn 1894, the station was the starting point of a 3 km long network of tramways that was stopped in 1934. In 1894 was also founded a secondary railway 42 km long linking Saintes to Mortagne-sur-Gironde, by Gémozac, then a somewhat important economic center ; however, this railway was dismantled in 1947.\n\nThe importance of this railway network is explained by the designation of Saintes as the seat of the Compagnie des chemins de fer des Charentes in 1867, then as the regional seat of the VIIIth arrondissement of the Chemins de fer de l'État from 1911 to 1971. The SNCF is still a major employer in the city, and new depots and workshops have been opened in 2009 and 2010.\n\nFrom 1793 to 2007\n\nThe hospital of Saintes is the most important hospital center of the department of Charente-Maritime\n\nSaintes is in the catchment of and under the auspices of the académie de Poitiers.\n\n\nSaintes is served by France 3 Nouvelle-Aquitaine. \n</ref>\n\nSaintes is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

He obtained his licence to practice medicine in 1926, having completed all courses throughout his studies with top marks.\n\nIn 1933, Heyde made the acquaintance of Theodor Eicke, and became a member of the NSDAP. One year later, he was appointed director of the polyclinic in Würzburg. In 1935, he entered the SS as medical officer with the rank of \"SS-Hauptsturmführer\", and became commander of the medical unit in the \"SS-Totenkopfverbände\". There he was responsible for establishing a system of psychiatric and eugenic examinations and research in concentration camps, and for the organisation of the T-4 Euthanasia Program. Additionally, he also worked as a psychiatric consultant for the \"Gestapo\". He also was leader of the Rassenpolitisches Amt in Würzburg, Seelbergstraße 8, 97080 Würzburg.

In modern times the ruler is known by a variety of names in various historiographies, including Lithuanian \"Švarnas\", Ukrainian Шварно Данилович, Russian and Belarusian Шварн, and Polish \"Szwarno Daniłowicz\". All of them are versions of the name of Shvarn, which is likely to be a diminutive of the Slavic name of \"Svaromir\".\n\nOne of the sons of king Daniel I of Galicia of the house of Romanovich, Shvarn inherited the north-western parts of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, his fathers' domain. This land included the town of Halicz itself, as well as the land across the Bug River, that is Red Ruthenia with the towns of Bełz, Czerwień, Mielnik, Drohiczyn and eventually also Kholm (since 1264). His brother Lev I inherited the southern part of the land, with the cities of Lviv and Przemyśl, while Roman became the heir of duchies of Lutsk and Terebovl.\n\nDuring the times of king Daniel's reign, the Galician lords were allied with their Polish neighbours against a common threat, the Lithuanian tribes that often raided the neighbouring lands for loot and plunder. However, in 1255 (or the previous year) Shvarn married an unnamed daughter of Mindaugas, since 1253 the first (and only) king of Lithuania. This allied him to Lithuania and together the two rulers undertook numerous military campaigns against the Kingdom of Poland. Already in 1255 they raided Lublin, in 1262 a major campaign against Masovia was started. Shvarn and Treniota captured the city of Płock and besieged Shvarn's brother-in-law, Siemowit I of Masovia in Jazdów (modern Warsaw). In the end Siemowit was killed by Shvarn's troops and his son Konrad II was taken prisoner. The Polish relief force did not arrive in time and was later defeated in a battle at Długosiodło on August 5, 1262.\n\nIn 1264 king Daniel of Galicia died and Shvarn received nominal overlordship over all of Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia as its duke. Immediately he mounted a major campaign against Poland, this time aiming for Lesser Poland. However, although joint armies managed to plunder Skaryszew, Tarczek and Wiślica, this time the campaign was less successful and the allied Ruthenian and Lithuanian armies were repelled. The Yotvingian auxiliaries were defeated by Bolesław V the Chaste at the Battle of Brańsk. The following year Bolesław mounted a counter-offensive against Shvarn and his uncle Vasilko Romanovich, and defeated the earlier on June 19, 1266 at Wrota. This weakened Shvarn's position in his own domain.\n\nIn the meantime in 1263 Mindaugas of Lithuania was murdered. In the chaos that followed Mindaugas' assassination, the lands of the Grand Duchy were in disarray, with both local and foreign rulers struggling for power. Shvarn gave his support to Vaišvilkas, one of Mindaugas' sons and his brother-in-law. Together they managed to depose Treniota and expel Dovmont all the way to Pskov. After Vaišvilkas returned to monastic life in 1267, Shvarn became the new Grand Duke. No details are known about Shvarn's rule over Lithuania and he probably did not gain a strong foothold in that country. However, he was apparently fairly successful in expanding his borders. Following successful military campaigns, in 1267 he defeated his brother Mstislav in the battle of the Yaselda River and captured Turov and Pinsk. He then campaigned against the Volga Tatars and defeated khan Balaklay in the battle of Kojdanow (modern Dzyarzhynsk, Belarus), which allowed Shvarn to capture the towns of Mozyr, Chernigov, Karachev and Starodub. The struggle for power within Lithuania however continued. Before a clear winner could emerge, Shvarm died in Kholm (nowadays Chełm, Poland) some time between 1269 and 1271. He was buried in an Orthodox Cathedral that once stood on a place now occupied by the Basilica of the Birth of the Virgin Mary. After his death most of his lands reverted to Lithuania and came under the control of Traidenis, a noble from Aukštaitija.\n\n"}

A \"fidalgo\" is comparable in some ways to the French \"\" (the word also implies nobility by birth or by charge) and to the Italian \"nobile\". The title was abolished after the overthrow of the Monarchy in 1910. It is also a family surname.\n\nThe word has the same etymological and historical roots as its Spanish cognate, \"hidalgo\". Although \"algo\" generally means \"something\", in this expression the word specifically denotes \"riches\" or \"wealth\" and thus was originally synonymous with \"rico homem\" (literally, \"a rich man\").\n\nAs late as the reign of Afonso III (1248–1279), who completed the reconquest of the Algarve, the nobility was not differentiated as it would be later. All nobles, who were the large landowners, were referred to simply by two synonyms, \"fidalgo\" and \"ricos homens\". Originally, \"rico homem\" referred to the administrative duties entrusted to a noble and \"fidalgo\" referred to the inherited status of nobility (in an older parlance, \"the nobility of blood\"). Below the \"ricos homens\" was a descending category of their vassals: the \"infanções\", the knights (\"cavaleiros\"), and the squires (\"escudeiros\").\n\n\"Rico homem\" and \"fidalgo\" reached their current meanings during the reign of John I (1385–1433). Large segments of the nobility did not side with John I in the crisis of 1383–1385 and the subsequent war with Castile; they lost their lands after the new king secured his claim to the throne and were replaced by a new nobility, elevated from previously non-noble families and modeled on the English system. \"Fidalgo\" came to be applied to a category analogous to the English \"gentleman.\"\n\nBy the start of the fifteenth century, the term \"infanção\" fell out of use and \"knight\" came to mean all those below the \"ricos homens\". \"Fidalgo\" began to be emphasized because, in its sense of someone who had inherited nobility, it differentiated the older knights from the growing \"bourgeoisie\" that continued to gain access to knighthood through accomplishments in the service of the state.\n"}

He taught the Jesuit seminarians at Dillingen as professor of rhetoric, and then for 23 years he was a court preacher to Maximilian I, the prince-elector of Bavaria in the Holy Roman Empire. It is said that his voice was strong enough to be heard in every corner of the church and that his sermons were such that an hour would seem like a few minutes.

{"id": "1862580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862580", "title": "Eruv", "text": "Eruv\n\nAn eruv (; , , also transliterated as eiruv or erub, plural: eruvin ) is a ritual halakhic enclosure made for the purpose of allowing activities which are normally prohibited on Shabbat (due to the prohibition of \"hotzaah mereshut lereshut\"), specifically: carrying objects from a private domain to a semi-public domain (\"carmelit\"), and transporting objects four cubits or more within a semi-public domain. The enclosure is made within some Jewish communities, especially Orthodox Jewish communities. \n\nAn eruv accomplishes this by symbolically integrating a number of private properties and spaces such as streets and sidewalks into one larger \"private domain\" by surrounding it with \"mechitzas\", thereby avoiding restrictions of transferring between domains. Often a group constructing an eruv obtains a lease to the required land from a local government.\n\nAn eruv allows Jews to carry, among other things, house keys, tissues, medication, or babies with them, and to use strollers and canes. The presence or absence of an eruv thus especially affects the lives of strictly observant Jews with limited mobility and those responsible for taking care of babies and young children.\n\nIn Jewish tradition it is commonly said that \"carrying\" is forbidden on Shabbat. Specifically, \"transferring between domains\" () is considered one of the 39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat.\n\nThe halacha of Shabbat divides spaces into four categories:\n\nA domain is defined as public or private based on its degree of enclosure, not its ownership. The rules here are complex, and expertise is needed to apply them.\n\nOn Shabbat, it is forbidden to transfer an object from one domain to another, including from one person's house to another adjacent house. The only exception is transferring to or from a neutral domain (which is rarely relevant).\n\nIn addition, it is also forbidden to transfer an object for a distance of 4 cubits (approximately 2 metres) within a public domain or \"carmelit\".\n\nWhile biblical law prohibits carrying objects between private and fully public domains on Shabbat, rabbinic law extends this restriction to carrying between a private domain and a semi-public \"carmelit\" as a safeguard of the biblical law. The rabbinic prohibition of carrying between a private domain and a \"carmelit\" is relaxed whenever an eruv is in place.\nThe term eruv is a shortening of \"eruv chatzerot\", literally a \"merger of [different] domains\" (into a single domain). This makes carrying within the area enclosed by the eruv no different from carrying within a single private domain (such as a house owned by a single person), which is permitted.\nThe eruv typically includes numerous private homes, as well as a semi-public courtyard whose ownership is shared by them. To enact the merger of the homes and courtyard into a single domain, all home owners as well as owners of the courtyard must pool together certain foodstuffs, which grants the area of the eruv the status of a single private domain. As a precondition for this merger, the area must be surrounded by a wall or fence.\n\nIn many cases (for example, within an apartment complex or walled city) the demarcation of the shared area consists of real walls or fences. Building walls may also be used, and in some cases so may a natural wall such as a river bank or steep hill.\n\nWalls may include doors and windows. As such, the wall may even consist of a series of \"doorframes\" with almost no wall between them. Poles in the ground form the \"doorposts\" of the doorframe, and rope or wire between the poles forms the \"lintel\" of the doorframe. In modern cities, it is typical for the majority of an eruv to consist of such doorframes, using utility poles and wires.\n\nWhen a \"doorframe\" is used as part of an eruv, it is required that the \"lintel\" rest on top of the \"doorpost\", rather than being attached to the side of the \"doorpost\". Since the \"lintel\" is frequently a utility wire which runs along the side of the utility pole, the pole cannot be used as \"doorpost\". In this case, an additional \"doorpost\", known in Hebrew as a \"lechi\" (pl. \"lechai'in\"), is attached to the side of the utility pole. This typically takes the form of a thin plastic pipe attached to the side of the utility pole, and the wire runs directly overhead of this pipe.\n\nWithin the walled area, a property transfer is needed to create the shared domain. This is formally effected today by having one resident give some \"bread\" to another resident to keep, to create a joint ownership of food for the whole community. This is usually done by the rabbi of the community to ensure that it is done correctly, and the bread is usually matzo to ensure that it will be edible and usable for a long time. (It is usually replaced once each year.) In the Talmud and other classic rabbinic sources, the term eruv refers to the bread itself.\n\nA typical modern eruv encloses public streets as well as private houses, and thus requires agreement from the government authorities controlling those streets. Creating an eruv that involves public property requires a government entity to grant permission in order to be valid. This is often done by issuing a symbolic proclamation which has no weight in secular law (see Legal status).\n\nIn the Bible, calls on Jews \"not to bring any burden into the gates of this city\", suggesting that carrying a \"burden\" \"within\" the city was permissible, even though the city consisted of numerous separate private domains. The commentary of Radak suggests that such carrying was permitted because Jerusalem had an eruv and its walls formed the boundary, so carrying within the city was permitted. This view that an entire city could have an eruv influenced later views that an eruv could encompass a \"courtyard\" covering a wide area.\n\nIn general, authorities agree that eruvin are subject to certain restrictions. For example, they can be located in only certain places, and may not be of indefinite size. A prohibition against walking too far outside city boundaries (\"techum\", see Eruv techumin) limits the possible size of an eruv. Also, the eruv walls or doorways must be at least ten \"tefachim\" (about 1 meter) in height.\n\nThe laws of eruv differ depending on whether the eruv contains only private domains and \"carmelit\", or else public domains (\"reshut harabim deoraita\") as well. If public domains are not included, the eruv wall may include \"doorways\" constructed out of wire and posts, with no actual door in them. If public domains are included, the wall must be an actual wall – every \"doorway\" must have a door in it, and these doors must be closed each night. This situation was common in ancient walled cities, but is rare nowadays. So in practice, eruvin are only built in areas that do not include a public domain.\n\nWhat constitutes a \"public area\" is debated. The strict opinion holds that any road more than 16 cubits wide is a public domain, while the lenient opinion holds that a public domain must have both 16 cubits of width and 600,000 people passing through the road on a single day. In practice, communities that build eruvin accept the lenient opinion. However, in a few large cities such as New York City, it is possible that more than 600,000 people pass through certain roads in a single day. This would prevent building an eruv there even according to the lenient opinion. This possibility is the source of debates in New York City over whether a particular eruv, or any eruv is valid.\nIn addition, the size of an eruv can be limited by a number of practical considerations. For example, the requirement that the eruv boundary be thoroughly checked each week and any needed repairs made before sunset on Friday limits the area that can be practically covered by a manageable eruv. The sensitivity of utility and public works crews about disturbing eruv-related attachments when making repairs can vary widely. Political and institutional differences, or differences about the correct interpretation of the relevant Jewish law, can also result in separate areas maintained by separate organizations.\n\nThe boundaries of an eruv must be checked regularly. If the boundary is not complete and contiguous in every element (i.e., one of the elements of the boundary is missing or broken), no valid eruv can exist that shabbat, and carrying remains prohibited. Eruv associations generally maintain hotlines or web sites informing communities of the status of the eruv on Friday afternoon.\n\nThough a valid eruv enables people to carry or move most items outdoors on Shabbat, all other Shabbat restrictions still apply. These prohibitions include:\n\nThere exists disagreement between rabbis about some of the technical requirements of a valid eruv. Thus, there are instances where Orthodox rabbis dispute the validity of a particular eruv (and therefore instruct their followers not to use it), or even dispute whether any eruv can be built in a certain location.\n\nOne of the oldest halakhic disputes in the United States revolves around the issue of an eruv in Manhattan, New York. In 1905, Rabbi Yehoshua Seigel created an eruv on Manhattan's Lower East Side, bounded by seawalls which once protected the island as well as the Third Avenue El; however, some other rabbis ruled the eruv to be invalid.\n\nIn the 1950s, a proposal by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Kasher to establish an eruv in Manhattan gained the support of many prominent rabbis, including Rabbis Yosef Eliyahu Henkin, Dovid Lifshitz, and Ephraim Oshry, and the Kopishnitzer, Novominsker and Radziner Rebbes. Other authorities, such as Rabbis Aharon Kotler and Moshe Feinstein, raised objections, and a major controversy ensued. In the end, the opponents Agudas Horabonim issued a declaration opposing it.\n\nIn June 2007, the East Side portion of the internal Manhattan Eruv was completed, offering an eruv within Manhattan to Orthodox Jews living on the East, Upper East, and Upper West Sides. There are also two eruvin in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood, one covering the Yeshiva University area and another that is part of Mount Sinai Jewish Center and covers the Fort Washington area.\n\nAnother ongoing dispute is the status of two inter-connected eruvin in Brooklyn: the Flatbush and Boro Park eruvin. The Boro Park eruv, from its initial construction, was rejected by most of the Hasidic community (though acceptance there has increased over time), and was rejected by most of the non-Hasidic \"Lithuanian yeshiva\" communities. The Flatbush eruv was originally built with the support of the Modern Orthodox community, and was later enhanced with the support of some local \"non-Modern Orthodox\" families. It was totally rejected by the many \"Lithuanian yeshiva\" communities led by the rosh yeshivas (\"deans\") of the large yeshivas Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, Mir Yeshiva, and Yeshiva Torah Vodaas that are based in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. In the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, there is some dispute over the making of an eruv, with Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, the Satmar Rebbe of Williamsburg leading the opposition to an eruv.\n\nAlthough Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards enacted an exception to the general rules of Sabbath observance to permit driving to attend a synagogue, it otherwise formally requires the same rules of Shabbat observance as Orthodox Judaism with respect to carrying a burden. Therefore, Conservative Judaism's rabbinate requires the use of an eruv for ordinary carrying outside this exception. Compliance with the formal requirements varies. In general, Conservative authorities and organizations have not attempted to build or develop rules for eruvin distinct from ones established by Orthodox authorities and organizations.\n\nReform, Reconstructionist, and other more liberal branches of Judaism do not call for observance of the underlying traditional rules against carrying, and hence the issue of an eruv is not relevant.\n\nMany of those living in areas without an eruv are accustomed to life without one and have adapted their Shabbat practices accordingly. However, those who live in a place that has an eruv and are visiting a place without one, or if the eruv is temporarily out of service (perhaps due to wind or snow damage), may have difficulty making adjustments. Equally, those with young children, certain medical complaints and certain disabilities often feel trapped during Shabbat.\n\nEven without an eruv, there is no problem with wearing clothing outside, provided that it is normal clothing and being worn in its normal manner, as it is considered secondary to, and \"part of,\" the person themselves. The same is true for most medical items that are attached to the body and can be considered secondary to it, such as a cast, a bandage, or eyeglasses.\n\nRabbinic authorities historically have differed about the use of a cane, wheelchair, or other similar devices by the less-able-bodied. Some have allowed their use even without an eruv and others have not. In recent years, however, the majority of poskim have leaned toward allowing these devices, since, if they were prohibited, disabled individuals might attempt to leave their homes on Shabbat without the device(s) and therefore risk serious injury.\n\nLoose medicines may not be carried; most authorities have agreed that it is preferable that one who constantly needs medication remain at home rather than transgressing Shabbat by carrying medication. But, if such a person leaves home, then comes in need of medication, it is permissible under the laws of Pikuach nefesh to break Shabbat and bring the medication to the person. A small number of authorities in recent years have been permitting carrying the medication, however, since such a person may be tempted to leave home without it, and then his/her life may be endangered thereafter.\n\nMany authorities allow the wearing of jewelry by women. As for a wristwatch, it could be seen either as an adornment (permitted to wear) or as a tool (forbidden to carry); therefore opinions are divided on whether men may wear wristwatches.\n\nIn communities without an eruv, it is customary to create belts, bracelets, necklaces, or similar wearable objects incorporating housekeys so that the keys can be worn rather than carried when going outdoors. To be validly \"worn\" rather than \"carried\", the key needs to be an integral part of the belt, bracelet, or other item rather than simply attached to it. It may be either an adornment if worn in a manner visible to others or a component needed to keep the wearable object fastened. Special \"shabbos belts\" and similar items that incorporate this property are sold in religious stores.\n\nA tallit may be worn while walking to/from the synagogue, as it is considered clothing. Prayer books and other books may not be carried; either they must be brought to the synagogue prior to Shabbat or else the congregation's prayer books must be used.\n\nIn Israel, almost every Jewish community is enclosed by an eruv. Outside Israel, there are over 150 community eruvin, as well as thousands of private ones enclosing only a few homes, or linking a synagogue to one or more nearby homes. Most major cities in North America have at least one, often surrounding only the Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods rather than the entire city. Outside North America, there are eruvin in Antwerp; Amsterdam; Bury, Greater Manchester (Whitefield); Gibraltar; Johannesburg; London; Melbourne; Perth; Rio de Janeiro; Strasbourg; Sydney; Venice and Vienna.\n\nThe installation of eruvin has been a matter of contention in many neighbourhoods around the world, with notable examples including the London Borough of Barnet; Outremont, Quebec; Tenafly, New Jersey; Agoura Hills, California; Westhampton Beach, New York; and Bergen County, New Jersey.\n\nAs the property-owner is the owner of the public streets, sidewalks and the utility poles on which symbolic boundaries are to be strung, some authorities have interpreted Jewish law as requiring the local government to participate in the process as one of the property owners by agreeing to the creation of the eruv, and to give permission for the construction of a symbolic boundary on its property. In addition, because municipal law and the rules of utility companies, in general, prohibit third parties from stringing attachments to utility poles and wires, the creation of an eruv has often necessitated obtaining permissions, easements, and exceptions to various local ordinances. These requirements that government give active permission for an eruv have given rise to both political and legal controversy.\n\nIn Oak Park, California, three hawks may have been injured by an eruv. However, there have been no reports of bird injuries associated with any other eruv.\n\nJewish people who are not in favor of an eruv may feel that after an eruv is created they live in a symbolically segregated community. \"It's like social engineering,\" said Arnold Sheiffer, founder of the opposition group Jewish People for the Betterment of Westhampton Beach. \"We [the Jewish people] fought like hell to get out of the ghetto and now they want to create that again. The opposition in the village here is very, very high.\"\n\nIn the United States, legal controversies about an eruv in a community often focus on provisions of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which addresses relations between government and religion. Opponents of an eruv typically take the view that the government participation in the eruv process necessary to approve its construction violates the First Amendment's prohibition of governmental establishment of religion. Proponents take the view that it constitutes a constitutionally permissible accommodation of religion rather than an establishment. Proponents have also argued that the Free Exercise Clause affirmatively requires government acceptance, on the grounds that government interference with or failure to accommodate an eruv constitutes discrimination against or inhibition of the constitutional right of free exercise of religion.\n\nIn the 2002 decision on \"Tenafly Eruv Association v. Borough of Tenafly\", Judge Ambro, writing for the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals, held that Eruv Association members had no intrinsic right to add attachments to telephone poles on Borough property and that the borough, if it wished, could enact a general, neutral ordinance against all attachments to utility poles that could be enforced against the eruv. However, Judge Ambro held that in this case, the Borough had not enacted a genuinely general or neutral ordinance because it permitted a wide variety of attachments to utility poles for non-religious purposes, including posting signs and other items. Because it permitted attachments to utility poles for secular purposes, the court held, it could not selectively exclude attachments for religious purposes. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case. It was subsequently cited as precedent by a number of other federal courts deciding disputes between an eruv association and a local government.\n\nIn Outremont, a neighbourhood in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the city adopted a policy of removing eruv wires. In 2001, the Hasidic community obtained an injunction preventing such action by the city authorities.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, there were ongoing issues with eruv markings extended on utility poles in a section of New Jersey. The adjoining municipalities of Mahwah, Upper Saddle River and Montvale, all border the state line on the other side of which is Rockland County, New York, where there are large communities of Orthodox Jews. After some eruvin were extended into Bergen County, allowing travel in the area, the municipalities took action in 2017 to dismantle the lechi markings. The matter was taken to court, and in January 2018 the presiding judge in the lawsuits made it clear he felt the municipalities did not have a strong case, and urged them to settle. The three municipalities have settled with the eruv association, allowing the eruv borders to remain in New Jersey, reimbursed the association's legal fees, received agreement from the association to adjust the color of the lechi mounted on local utility poles, and agreed to work through a few remaining route details. \n\nIn general, state law has dealt with whether and to what extent government can permit or assist the erection and maintenance of boundary demarcations on public property. It has not dealt with the nature of the aggregation agreement or recognized an eruv as having legal effect or as implementing a meaningful change in real property ownership or tenancy. For purposes of accident liability, trespass, insurance, and other secular matters occurring on Shabbat, state law treats the properties within an eruv as continuing to be separate parcels.\n\nThe term eruv is also used to refer to other, unrelated concepts in halakha. These include the \"eruv techumin\" which enables one to travel beyond the normal travel restrictions on Shabbat or holidays, and the \"eruv tavshilin\" which enables one to cook for Shabbat on a holiday which immediately precedes that Shabbat.\nAn \"eruv techumin\" (Hebrew: עירוב תחומין \"mixing of borders\") for traveling enables a traditionally observant Jew to travel by foot on Shabbat or a Jewish holiday beyond the 2,000-cubit (one biblical mile) limit imposed by rabbinic restriction.\n\nAn \"eruv tavshilin\" () is made in the home on the eve of a holiday with a work prohibition, if the holiday happens to fall on Friday. Since food cannot be cooked on Shabbat, the only way to eat freshly cooked food on Shabbat is to cook it on Friday, which in this case is a holiday. The \"eruv tavshilin\" allows this cooking to be done in a way that does not violate the holiday work restrictions.\n\nGeneral\n\nTextual resources\n"}

FC Nürnberg for an alleged transfer fee of €100,000 and an agreement that should Mintál be transferred again, MŠK Žilina would receive a portion of the transfer fee. His new club was playing in the 2. Bundesliga at this time. He continued his scoring run by scoring 18 goals and becoming the German second division's leading scorer and was a crucial part of Nürnberg's immediate promotion. During that season, Mintál, an offensive midfielder, became widely regarded for his inconspicuous style of play, which has led to him being called \"stealth bomber\", \"Sniper\" or \"Phantom\". In the following year, Mintál led the Bundesliga in scoring with 24 goals, and helped Nürnberg stave off relegation.\n\nHis continuous success in scoring goals sparked rumours that he might move to a bigger club during the 2005 summer break. He had been linked in transfer speculation with Liverpool, Beşiktaş, Villarreal and VfB Stuttgart. These rumours did not lead to a transfer and Mintal decided to stay at Nürnberg. However the following season turned out to be disastrous for the Slovak striker who broke his foot twice in the span of five months. Thus, the offensive midfielder only played in four games and scored just a single goal.\n\nHe celebrated his competitive comeback against Borussia Mönchengladbach when coming on as a substitute after 60 minutes. Two weeks later, he also played for his country again, scoring two goals against Cyprus. Later the same year, he was troubled again by his broken foot and had to undergo surgery for a second time.\n\nMintál won the DFB-Pokal with 1. FC Nürnberg in the year 2007. In this game, he also scored a goal, during this match, he was injured by Fernando Meira, a Portuguese defender from VfB Stuttgart. 1. FC Nürnberg won the game 3–2 after extra time. He scored a brace in a UEFA Cup match against AZ to keep their European dreams alive.\n\nHis player career ended in 2013.\n\nFor the 2013–14 season until October 2014, he assisted his former team 1. FC Nürnberg in coaching before transferring to Slovakia to complete his coaching license. Mintál returned to Nürnberg as assistant coach for the 2015–16 season and is currently also assistant coach of its U19 team. On 12 February 2019 he was named interim assistant coach of the first team. He was promoted as the head coach on 4 November 2019 for one game.\n\n\"As of 15 January 2011\"\n\nMŠK Žilina\n\n1.

Dick. First published in \"Fantasy and Science Fiction\" magazine, January 1959. \"Explorers We\" was reprinted as a limited edition booklet to commemorate Dick's appearance at the Second International Festival of Science Fiction at Metz, France, September 1977. It was written in 1958, one of only two short stories that Dick wrote in the seven years between 1956 and 1962.\n\nIn this story some aliens come to Earth as perfect replicas of a group of astronauts who died during a mission to Mars. The astronauts seem to be utterly convinced they are humans and they do not understand why the FBI chases them after they have 'come back' to Earth. Humans only know that these astronauts are not the same as those who originally left for Mars, and nothing more. The original astronauts could have been saved and/or cloned by the aliens. The disguise could be a way to try to communicate more easily with the earthlings. Still other factors could explain these perfect copies of human beings, but the earthlings have no intention of investigating them. Above all, the possible threat must be eliminated, and only then questions can be asked. At the end of the story, Wilks, an FBI agent, poses the central question raised by the story:\n\nAfter this brief meditation Wilks goes on to kill the last of the six astronauts, but he soon realizes that he did it only because he was afraid of an alien invasion: \"That's what we are told... they are plotting against us, are inhuman, and will never be more than that\". He also realizes that the cycle will only continue. At the end of \"Explorers We\" the beginning is repeated. Another spaceship with the same six astronauts aboard lands on Earth.\n\n<br>\n"}

He attended Cannstatt Gymnasium, one of the oldest Latin schools in Stuttgart area. From 1906 to 1912 he studied theology, medicine, and philosophy at the universities of Tübingen, Munich and Hamburg. From 1913 he was assistant of Robert Gaupp in Tübingen, where he received his habilitation in 1918. He continued as assistant medical director until 1926.\n\nIn 1926 he became the director of the psychiatric clinic at Marburg University.\n\nKretschmer was a founding member of the International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy (AÄGP) which was founded on January 12, 1927. He was the president of AÄGP from 1929. In 1933 he resigned from the AÄGP for political reasons.\n\nFrom 1946 until 1959, Kretschmer was the director of the psychiatric clinic of the University of Tübingen. He died, aged 75, in Tübingen.\n\nAfter he resigned from the AÄGP, he started to support the SS and signed the \"Vow of allegiance of the professors of the German universities and high-schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic state.\" ().\n\nKretschmer was the first to describe the persistent vegetative state which has also been called \"Kretschmer's syndrome\". Another medical term coined after him is \"Kretschmer’s sensitive paranoia.\" This classification has the merit of singling out \"a type of paranoia that was unknown\" prior to Kretschmer, and which \"does not resemble the stereotypical image [...] of sthenic paranoia\". Furthermore, between 1915 and 1921 he developed a differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and manic depression.\n\nKretschmer is also known for developing a classification system that can be seen as one of the earliest exponents of a constitutional (the total plan or philosophy on which something is constructed) approach. His classification system was based on four main body types:\n\nThe concept of two great psychopathological types of manic-depressive or 'circular' insanity and dementia praecox (i. e. schizophrenia) was developed by Emil Kraepelin.\n\nEach of these body types was associated by Kretschmer with certain personality traits and, in a more extreme form, mental disorders. He wrote that there is only a weak relation between Schizophrenics and pyknic body type on the one hand, and between Circulars (with the tendency to circular type of manic-depressive psychosis) and asthenics, athletics, and dysplastics on the other. Among the schizophrenics also the asthenico–athletic types are very prevalent. Kretschmer believed that pyknic persons were friendly, interpersonally dependent, and gregarious. In a more extreme version of these traits, this would mean for example that the obese are predisposed toward manic-depressive illness. Thin types were associated with introversion and timidity. This was seen as a milder form of the negative symptoms exhibited by withdrawn schizophrenics. However, the idea of the association of body types with personality traits is no longer influential in personality psychology.\n\nThe essential characteristic of the asthenic type, in Kretschmer's words, \"a deficiency in thickness combined with an average unlessened length\". The deficiency is present in all parts of body: muscle, bone, neck, face, trunk, extremities, and in all the tissues skin. The average weight as well as the other body measurements are below the general value for males.\n\nWe have, consequently, in the clearest cases a lean narrowly-built man: with narrow shoulders, with thin muscles, delicately boned hands, with a narrow, long, flat chest, on which we can usually see the ribs.\n\nThe asthenic female are not only thin, but also of very small height. In their general appearance they're the same as asthenic men.\n\nThe male athletic type is characterized by the strong development of the musculature, skeleton, and also the skin.\n\nWe have, therefore, in the clearest cases the following general impression: a man with a middle-sized to tall man, with a superb chest, wide projecting shoulders (\"particularly the hypertrophied shoulders\" as Kretschmer said), firm stomach, magnificent legs. The expression \"hypertrophied\" meaning a development which oversteps the average, not in the sense of a pathological disturbance.\n\nThe athletic type among female corresponds to the male form. The certain characteristic deviation is the development of fat, it's rich, but not electively abnormal as with pyknics. Besides of these athletic type women with feminine rounded figure, there are also those women which have outstanding musculature in body face and face. In many cases, athletic type women are actually masculine in muscle relief.\n\nThe pyknic type is characterized by the peripheral development of the body cavities (breast, head, and stomach), and a tendency to a distribution of fat about the torso. They also have a more graceful construction of the motor apparatus (limbs and shoulders).\n\nThe characteristics of the well-developed cases: rounded figure, middle height, a soft broad face on a short massive neck, sitting between the shoulders, shoulders are not broad; soft, rounded, and displaying little muscle relief limbs, the hands soft, rather wide and short.\n\nThe pyknic type tend emphatically to a covering of fat. The obesity of the pyknic is restricted within moderate limits for the most part. The female pyknics covering of fat is more strongly concentrated over the hips and chest.\n\nThe ratio of chest to shoulder of the female pyknics is the same as in the male pyknics.\n\nKretschmer divided the temperaments into the two \"constitutional groups\": schizothymic, which contain a \"psychæsthetic proportion\" between sensitive and cold poles, and cyclothymes which contain a \"diathetic\" proportion between raised (happy) and sad. The modern term for light version of 'circular' insanity is cyclothymia. Psychic tempo of schizothymic people is between unstable and tenacious and they have alternation mode of feeling and thought, and cyclothymes psychic tempo is between mobile and comfortable. Schizothymic's psychomotility is often inadequate to stimulus: inhibited, restrained, lamed, stiff, etc., and psychomotility of cyclothymes is adequate to stimulus and natural. Cyclothymes are often pyknics, schizothymes – athletic, asthenic, dysplastic, and their mixtures.\n\nThe Schizoids consist of the hyperæsthetic (sensitive) and anæsthetic (cold) characters.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its construction started in 1604. It was the first summit level canal in Europe that was built using pound locks, connecting the Loire and Seine valleys. It is long and is part of the Bourbonnais route from Saint-Mammès on the Seine to Chalon-sur-Saône on the Saône.\n\nFrom Briare to Buges, the canal rises through the first 12 locks some and then falls through the remaining 24 locks.\n\nThe canal was initiated by Maximilien de Béthune, duc de Sully, with support from Henry IV in order to develop the grain trade, and to reduce food shortages. Its construction started in 1604 and was completed in 1642. Between 6,000 and 12,000 labourers worked on this canal which connects the basins of the River Loire and the River Seine. Hugues Cosnier obtained the contract to build the second canal crossing a watershed in Europe, involving many more locks than on the first\" It was thus necessary to use locks. A staircase of seven locks was built in Rogny-les-Sept-Écluses. (This was bypassed in 1887 but is preserved as an ancient monument and floodlit at night.)\n\nAfter Henri IV's assassination, Hugues Cosnier had to give up work in 1611. In 1638, Guillaume Boutheroue and Jacques Guyon applied to resume work, and received letters patent from Louis XIII for this purpose. They created with other nobles the \"Compagnie des seigneurs du canal de Loyre en Seine\" and work was completed by 1642.\n\nReservoirs were dug to supply the approximately 2000 cubic meters of water displaced at each lock. They include the reservoirs of Turfs, Chesnoy, Grand-rû, Tilery, Du Chateau, Cahauderie, Beaurois, the Bourdon reservoir, and the Moutiers reservoir on the Loing. The original source of water was the Étang de la Gazonne.\n\nBy the mid 18th century more than 500 wine barges were in use bringing wines from the Auvergne, Mâcon, Beaujolais, Sancerre, and Languedoc regions. Other cargoes included firewood, timber, coal and iron, faïence from Nevers and fruit from the Auvergne. All hauling was done by men, generally two to a boat.\n\nShortages of water in the reservoirs and Loire valley often resulted in 2–3 months closure per year.\n\nThe canal was repurchased by the State in 1860.\n\nIn periods of drought the canal's reservoirs were insufficient to keep the canal full of water, therefore in 1894 and 1895 a pumping station was built to pump water into the summit pound.\n\nThe Briare aqueduct built over the Loire in Briare between 1890 and 1896 by the engineer Abel Mazoyer is part of the Canal latéral à la Loire, and replaced the old line of that canal, built between 1820 and 1830.\n\n\n\n"}

MSSS is headed by chief scientist and CEO Michael C. Malin.\n\nFounded in 1990, their first mission was the failed 1993 Mars Observer for which they developed and operated the Mars Observer Camera Ground Data System. After this mission they were selected to provide the main camera for Mars Global Surveyor. They also developed the cameras that were carried on Mars Polar Lander, Mars Climate Orbiter, 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and \"\"Phoenix\" lander.\n\nOne of the most successful of their instruments to date was the Mars Observer Camera (MOC), on board the Mars Global Surveyor placed into orbit around Mars in September 1997. From that date until November 2006, the MOC took more than 243,000 images of Mars, some at very high resolution. Among the MOCs notable successes was the imaging of the landing sites of the two Mars Exploration Rovers (the discarded heatshield of one of the rovers was located). Even before they landed, images from the MOC were very useful in picking the destinations of the two rovers.\n\nAfter more than nine years of active duty, the Mars Global Surveyor ceased sending data back to Earth and it is now lost along with all its instruments, including the MOC.\n\nFor the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched on August 12, 2005, MSSS built the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) which takes wide angle, daily global views of Mars and the Context Imager (CTX) which has a six-metre resolution.\n\nThe Mars Science Laboratory was launched in 2011 and it carries three MSSS cameras. The MastCam is the main camera on board taking still and motion images of the surroundings. The 'HandLens Imager' is on the instrument arm and provides close up images of martian soil and rocks. Finally the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) provided high resolution images of the ground during descent.\n\nIn December 2004, MSSS was selected to provide three cameras for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (2008) mission, under contract to Northwestern University. Recently, The MSSS has developed JunoCam for the \"Juno\" Jupiter Mission, which launched in 2011.\n\nIn July 2014, NASA announced the selection of the Mastcam-Z proposal for the upcoming Mars 2020 rover mission, to be provided by MSSS. It is an improved zoom version of the original MastCam.\n\nIn June 2000, evidence for water currently under the surface of Mars was discovered in the form of flood-like gullies. The question that was immediately asked was: is this an ongoing process or is this ancient and simply well preserved evidence of water/liquid flow? Most scientists agree that it is highly likely that water did flow on Mars in the distant past.\n\nMalin's camera controllers attempted to answer this question by taking photos of the same locations and in 2005 observation showed two areas where change had clearly occurred within the time of the photos (in other words, the activity was happening in present time and was not ancient).\n\nOn December 6, 2006, MSSS announced that it had discovered evidence that liquid water had likely flowed on Mars within the past five years. At a press conference, NASA showed images taken by the Mars Global Surveyor that suggested that water occasionally flows on the surface of Mars. The images did not actually show flowing water. Rather, they showed changes in craters and sediment deposits, providing the strongest evidence yet that water coursed through them as recently as several years ago, and is perhaps doing so even now. The findings were published in the December 8, 2006 issue of the journal \"Science\".\n\nMalin Systems published several documents which describe what they found:\n\nBefore the December 2006 paper, some researchers were skeptical that liquid water was responsible for the surface features seen by the spacecraft. They said other materials such as sand or dust can flow like a liquid and produce similar results. At this stage, (late 2006) the flowing water hypothesis looks strong, however more evidence is needed. For more, see Life on Mars.\n\nThe MSSS cameras on board the Mars Global Surveyor, produced high resolution images that were also processed by Malin Space Science Systems, and discovered the intriguing polar features informally known as 'dark dune spots' and 'spiders'. The origin of dark dune spots and the dark slope streaks emanating from them is yet uncertain, and various hypotheses have been put forward on their origin and formation process. The current model proposed by NASA and European teams propose cold geyser-like systems that eject CO and dark basaltic sand. The seasonal frosting of some areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent 1 metre thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a growth rate rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spider-like pattern of radial channels under the ice.\n\nMalin manufactured the following cameras for NASA spacecraft:\n\n"}

{"id": "1862647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862647", "title": "MonetDB", "text": "MonetDB\n\nMonetDB is an open-source column-oriented database management system developed at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.\nIt was designed to provide high performance on complex queries against large databases, such as combining tables with hundreds of columns and millions of rows.\nMonetDB has been applied in high-performance applications for online analytical processing, data mining, geographic information system (GIS), Resource Description Framework (RDF), text retrieval and sequence alignment processing.\n\nData mining projects in the 1990s required improved analytical database support. This resulted in a CWI spin-off called Data Distilleries, which used early MonetDB implementations in its analytical suite. Data Distilleries eventually became a subsidiary of SPSS in 2003, which in turn was acquired by IBM in 2009.\n\nMonetDB in its current form was first created in 2002 by doctoral student Peter Boncz and professor Martin L. Kersten as part of the 1990s' MAGNUM research project at University of Amsterdam. It was initially called simply Monet, after the French impressionist painter Claude Monet. The first version under an open-source software license (a modified version of the Mozilla Public License) was released on September 30, 2004. When MonetDB version 4 was released into the open-source domain, many extensions to the code base were added by the MonetDB/CWI team, including a new SQL front end, supporting the standard.\n\nMonetDB introduced innovations in all layers of the DBMS: a storage model based on vertical fragmentation, a modern CPU-tuned query execution architecture that often gave MonetDB a speed advantage over the same algorithm over a typical interpreter-based RDBMS. It was one of the first database systems to tune query optimization for CPU caches. MonetDB includes automatic and self-tuning indexes, run-time query optimization, and a modular software architecture.\n\nBy 2008, a follow-on project called X100 (MonetDB/X100) started, which evolved into the VectorWise technology. VectorWise was acquired by Actian Corporation, integrated with the Ingres database and sold as a commercial product.\n\nIn 2011 a major effort to renovate the MonetDB codebase was started. As part of it, the code for the MonetDB 4 kernel and its XQuery components were frozen. In MonetDB 5, parts of the SQL layer were pushed into the kernel. The resulting changes created a difference in internal APIs, as it transitioned from MonetDB Instruction Language (MIL) to MonetDB Assembly Language (MAL). Older, no-longer maintained top-level query interfaces were also removed. First was XQuery, which relied on MonetDB 4 and was never ported to version 5. The experimental Jaql interface support was removed with the October 2014 release. With the July 2015 release, MonetDB gained support for read-only data sharding and persistent indices. In this release the deprecated streaming data module DataCell was also removed from the main codebase in an effort to streamline the code. In addition, the license has been changed into the Mozilla Public License, version 2.0.\n\nMonetDB architecture is represented in three layers, each with its own set of optimizers.\nThe front end is the top layer, providing query interface for SQL, with SciQL and SPARQL interfaces under development. Queries are parsed into domain-specific representations, like relational algebra for SQL, and optimized. The generated logical execution plans are then translated into MonetDB Assembly Language (MAL) instructions, which are passed to the next layer. The middle or back-end layer provides a number of cost-based optimizers for the MAL. The bottom layer is the database kernel, which provides access to the data stored in Binary Association Tables (BATs). Each BAT is a table consisting of an Object-identifier and value columns, representing a single column in the database.\n\nMonetDB internal data representation also relies on the memory addressing ranges of contemporary CPUs using demand paging of memory mapped files, and thus departing from traditional DBMS designs involving complex management of large data stores in limited memory.\n\nQuery recycling is an architecture for reusing the byproducts of the operator-at-a-time paradigm in a column store DBMS. Recycling makes use of the generic idea of storing and reusing the results of expensive computations. Unlike low-level instruction caches, query recycling uses an optimizer to pre-select instructions to cache. The technique is designed to improve query response times and throughput, while working in a self-organizing fashion. The authors from the CWI Database Architectures group, composed of Milena Ivanova, Martin Kersten, Niels Nes and Romulo Goncalves, won the \"Best Paper Runner Up\" at the ACM SIGMOD 2009 conference for their work on Query Recycling.\n\nMonetDB was one of the first databases to introduce Database Cracking. Database Cracking is an incremental partial indexing and/or sorting of the data. It directly exploits the columnar nature of MonetDB. Cracking is a technique that shifts the cost of index maintenance from updates to query processing. The query pipeline optimizers are used to massage the query plans to crack and to propagate this information. The technique allows for improved access times and self-organized behavior. Database Cracking received the ACM SIGMOD 2011 J.Gray best dissertation award.\n\nA number of extensions exist for MonetDB that extend the functionality of the database engine. Due to the three-layer architecture, top-level query interfaces can benefit from optimizations done in the backend and kernel layers.\n\nMonetDB/SQL is a top-level extension, which provides complete support for transactions in compliance with the standard.\n\nMonetDB/GIS is an extension to MonetDB/SQL with support for the Simple Features Access standard of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).\n\nSciQL an SQL-based query language for science applications with arrays as first class citizens. SciQL allows MonetDB to effectively function as an array database. SciQL is used in the European Union PlanetData and TELEIOS project, together with the Data Vault technology, providing transparent access to large scientific data repositories. Data Vaults map the data from the distributed repositories to SciQL arrays, allowing for improved handling of spatio-temporal data in MonetDB. SciQL will be further extended for the Human Brain Project.\n\nData Vault is a database-attached external file repository for MonetDB, similar to the SQL/MED standard. The Data Vault technology allows for transparent integration with distributed/remote file repositories. It is designed for scientific data data exploration and mining, specifically for remote sensing data. There is support for the GeoTIFF (Earth observation), FITS (astronomy), MiniSEED (seismology) and NetCDF formats.\nThe data is stored in the file repository in the original format, and loaded in the database in a lazy fashion, only when needed. The system can also process the data upon ingestion, if the data format requires it.\n\nAs a result, even very large file repositories can be efficiently analyzed, as only the required data is processed in the database. The data can be accessed through either the MonetDB SQL or SciQL interfaces. The Data Vault technology was used in the European Union's TELEIOS project, which was aimed at building a virtual observatory for Earth observation data. Data Vaults for FITS files have also been used for processing astronomical survey data for The INT Photometric H-Alpha Survey (IPHAS) \n\nMonetDB has a SAM/BAM module for efficient processing of sequence alignment data. Aimed at the bioinformatics research, the module has a SAM/BAM data loader and a set of SQL UDFs for working with DNA data. The module uses the popular SAMtools library.\n\nMonetDB/RDF is a SPARQL-based extension for working with linked data, which adds support for RDF and allowing MonetDB to function as a triplestore. Under development for the Linked Open Data 2 project.\n\nMonetDB/R module allows for UDFs written in R to be executed in the SQL layer of the system. This is done using the native R support for running embedded in another application, inside the RDBMS in this case. Previously the MonetDB.R connector allowed the using MonetDB data sources and process them in an R session. The newer R integration feature of MonetDB does not require data to be transferred between the RDBMS and the R session, reducing overhead and improving performance. The feature is intended to give users access to functions of the R statistical software for in-line analysis of data stored in the RDBMS. It complements the existing support for C UDFs and is intended to be used for in-database processing.\n\nSimilarly to the embedded R UDFs in MonetDB, the database now has support for UDFs written in Python/NumPy. The implementation uses Numpy arrays (themselves Python wrappers for C arrays), as a result there is limited overhead - providing a functional Python integration with speed matching native SQL functions. The Embedded Python functions also support mapped operations, allowing user to execute Python functions in parallel within SQL queries. The practical side of the feature gives users access to Python/NumPy/SciPy libraries, which can provide a large selection of statistical/analytical functions.\n\nFollowing the release of remote driver for R (MonetDB.R) and R UDFs in MonetDB (MonetDB/R), the authors created an embedded version of MonetDB in R called MonetDBLite. It is distributed as an R package, removing the need to manage a database server, required for the previous R integrations. The DBMS runs within the R process itself, eliminating socket communication and serialisation overhead - greatly improving efficiency. The idea behind it is to deliver an SQLite-like package for R, with the performance of an in-memory optimized columnar store.\n\nA number of former extensions have been deprecated and removed from the stable code base over time. Some notable examples include an XQuery extension removed in MonetDB version 5; a JAQL extension, and a streaming data extension called \"Data Cell\".\n\n\n"}

They regularly brawl with members of other gangs. Ben becomes engaged to his girlfriend Jane and Frank takes out a loan to pay for the reception. He is attacked by the leader of another gang, Ringo, and they fight over the money. After the wedding Ben and Frank attack Ringo in retaliation and Frank gets carried away and kills him. They meet with Paul and decide to flee Hong Kong to escape the police. They decide to go to Vietnam, as they have heard that there is money to be made as smugglers due to the war.\n\nBen, Paul, and Frank get a load of contraband goods from a Hong Kong smuggler and agree to take them to a Vietnamese gangster named Leong. The three friends leave and reach Saigon by boat, only to have a Vietcong suicide bomber destroy all of their goods in an attempt on an officer of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. They are arrested as suspects in the bombing and beaten, until the real bomber is discovered and executed in front of them. They meet Luke, a hitman working for Leong, who dreams of escaping Vietnam with Sally, a nightclub singer Leong has kidnapped and forced into prostitution. The four men attempt to save her, a plan which goes wrong and culminates in a shootout in the nightclub. During the altercation Paul discovers a box of gold in Leong's office and steals it. They escape the nightclub, but Sally is shot in the back and injured.\n\nThe next morning, the five of them wait by the river for a boat that is supposed to pick them up. Ben and Frank are concerned with Sally and Paul guards the gold. They are attacked by gangsters and the ARVN as the boat arrives, and Sally dies just as they board it. Luke lets her body drift down the river. As they escape, the boat breaks down, and Paul becomes distressed over losing the gold. The three friends fight over Paul's preoccupation with the gold, and Ben and Frank tell him that the friendship is over. The boat is attacked by gangsters and sunk. Luke, Ben, and Frank escape, but Paul goes back for the gold, almost drowning before Ben and Frank save him and the gold.\n\nBen, Paul, and Frank are captured by the Vietcong and taken to a concentration camp. The Vietcong take the gold, and find intelligence documents in the box that Leong was going to sell to the North Vietnamese. The three friends are brutally interrogated, and Paul claims to work for the CIA to save the others. Frank is forced to kill other prisoners, which distresses him, but Ben asks to join in. When he is told to kill Frank he turns on their captors and they escape, aided by the arrival of a squad of Americans led by Luke. Paul escapes from the Vietcong as well and takes the gold into a field. Frank, who is wounded, follows him and begs for help. They hide from the Vietcong and Paul urges Frank to be quiet, but he continues to scream in pain and fear, and Paul finally shoots him in the back of the head to silence him. Luke rushes to Frank's side, finding him still alive, and loads him into a helicopter.\n\nBen chases Paul, who finds his way to a peaceful river village and steals a boat, massacring the villagers in the process. Ben witnesses this, and when he tries to save a child Paul shoots them both and escapes. Ben is saved by some monks, and eventually makes his way back to Saigon, where a badly disfigured Luke tells him that Frank is still alive, but that his head injury has changed him; he is now addicted to heroin and works as a contract killer. Luke takes Ben to see him, and after a brief altercation, Ben shoots Frank to put him out of his misery.\n\nBen travels back to Hong Kong and is reunited with Jane, who has given birth to a child. Meanwhile, Paul has become a successful businessman. Ben confronts him over his actions, showing him Frank's skull and blaming him for what happened to him. Paul is indifferent and kicks Ben out. Later, Ben attacks Paul on the street and they engage in a car chase. They find themselves on the pier where they played together as children. They crash their cars, and continue to fight. Eventually Ben shoots Paul fatally, then tosses his gun away and limps from the scene.\n\n\n\"Bullet in the Head\" was originally planned to be a prequel to \"A Better Tomorrow\" but a falling out between Woo and producer Tsui Hark prevented this from happening. Woo reworked the script into what it is today, and Tsui made his own prequel, \"A Better Tomorrow III\". After the breakup with his partnership with Tsui, Woo was having trouble finding backing for his films; stories have circulated that Tsui (one of the most powerful men in Hong Kong cinema) said Woo was hard to work with, and this led to his virtual blacklisting. At any rate, Woo financed almost all of the cost of the movie out of his own pocket.\n\nWoo rewrote much of the script to incorporate his reaction to the 1989 incident in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Woo has described this project as his equivalent of \"Apocalypse Now\", as it had the same exhausting and draining effect on him as that film had on Francis Ford Coppola. The cost of the film was around US$3.5 million, the highest budget for a Hong Kong film at the time. Like Woo's previous film, \"The Killer\", this film did not do well in Hong Kong because audiences didn't like the allusions to the Tiananmen Square protests during the riot scenes. Woo was deeply affected by the shootings and felt bad that he touched such a raw nerve in people, but at the same time he felt the Chinese people should react and not hide from it.\n\nThe Vietnam exteriors were shot in Thailand, and the interiors were shot in Hong Kong at the Cinema City Studio. It was deemed too expensive to shoot the nightclub shootout in Thailand. The helicopter footage used in the camp raid was a mixture of stock footage from the Vietnam War, as well as scenes from another Vietnam film.\n\nDuring the filming of some of the riot sequences, things got so chaotic on the set that John Woo panicked and ran into several shots. Once, he actually ran into an explosion, which caused large cuts on his head. Simon Yam actually burnt his face during the POW camp sequence.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the film grossed HK$8,545,123 – a disaster when considering its large budget. John Woo is quoted in Jeff Yang's book \"Once Upon a Time in China\" as saying that Tsui Hark's \"A Better Tomorrow III\" was rushed into theatres to beat \"Bullet in the Head\" at the box office.\n\nIn his book \"The Hong Kong Filmography: 1977–1999\" John Charles gave the film a nine out of ten rating, declaring it as John Woo's \"most emotionally powerful film\" that \"comes close to being a masterpiece\" The review compared the film to \"The Deer Hunter\", stating that its influence was \"obvious\" but that one could miss the first half an hour of the aforementioned film and not miss any important information. The review praised Romeo Diaz and James Wong's score as \"superb\".\n\nIn 2014, \"Time Out\" polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. \"Bullet in the Head\" was listed at 93rd place on this list.\n\nWoo's original cut of the film ran over three hours long. Golden Princess demanded that Woo cut the film down to a commercially viable length; however, the original theatrical version still remained massively edited from Woo's final cut. As a result, the film exists in many different cuts due to local/market censorship. The longest version available now is the 2 disc-set edition by Joy Sales with a runtime of 135 minutes. The longer 136-minute version was screened at a festival and was released on a bootleg VHS.\n\nOn 5 July 2004, a DVD was released on a two-disc platinum edition by Hong Kong Legends in the United Kingdom in Region 2. One year later, The John Woo Collection DVD was released on 5 September 2005, as a four-disc set including two Chow Yun-fat films: \"The Killer\" and \"Once a Thief\". All three films were directed by John Woo.\n\nA director's cut lasting 136 minutes screened at some festivals. It has been illegally released on a bootleg VHS. Another 135-minute version released on DVD has been sold to the public legally. It is distributed by Joy Sales; this disc has seamless branching which can be shown in its Theatrical Version, Alternate Ending version and the Festival Print version but the deleted scenes maintain a blue tint (possibly from the chemicals of the film reacting badly) and also frame jumping (film preservation done too late by the director himself).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1862675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862675", "title": "Shōen", "text": "Shōen\n\nA was a field or manor in Japan. The Japanese term comes from the Tang dynasty Chinese term \"莊園\" (Mandarin: \"zhuāngyuán\", Cantonese: \"zong1 jyun4\").\n\nShōen, from about the 8th to the late 15th century, describes any of the private, tax-free, often autonomous estates or manors whose rise undermined the political and economic power of the emperor and contributed to the growth of powerful local clans. The estates developed from land tracts assigned to officially sanctioned Shintō shrines or Buddhist temples or granted by the emperor as gifts to the Imperial family, friends, or officials. As these estates grew, they became independent of the civil administrative system and contributed to the rise of a local military class. With the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate, or military dictatorship, in 1192, centrally appointed stewards weakened the power of these local landlords. The shōen system passed out of existence around the middle of the 15th century, when villages became self-governing units, owing loyalty to a feudal lord (\"daimyō\") who subdivided the area into fiefs and collected a fixed tax.\n\nAfter the decay of the ritsuryō system, a feudal system of manors developed. Landowners or nameholders commended shares of the revenue produced (called \"shiki\") to more powerful leaders often at the court, in order to be exempted from taxes and to subvert the Chinese-style \"equal fields\" system, whereby land was redistributed after certain periods of time. In the Kamakura period a hierarchy of nameholder, manor stewards (\"jitō\"), \"shugo\" (military provincial governor), and the \"shōgun\" in Kamakura had evolved. These \"shōen\" were completely free from interference from the government, which therefore had no say or control of what occurred within the \"shōen\"s boundaries.\n\nBy the end of the Heian period virtually all Japanese land had become \"shōen\" and continued to be through the Ōnin War until the Sengoku period.\n\nShōen appeared in the 6th century and disappeared in the 16th century. They can be distinguished by historical period, and a shōen of each period had specific features in its formation and relationships with the cultivators of its fields. There are two primary periods of shōen development, although in fact smaller and more detailed categorizations exist. The first type; which developed in the middle of the Nara period, are now called shoki-shōen (初期庄園, lit. \"early Shōen\"). Shōen of the second type, which continued from the middle of Heian period to the Sengoku period, are called chūsei-shōen (中世荘園, lit. \"medieval Shōen\"). Note that these names and the distinction between the two are modern concepts, and were not used historically and cannot be found in the historical record.\n\nThe earliest antecedent of the shōen are \"tatokoro\" or \"naritokoro\" (田庄); which is thought to be one of the etymologies of the term \"shōen\". Before the \"ritsuryō\" system or taika reform, land was divided up between powerful families historically called \"gōzoku\" (豪族) or influential Buddhist temples, and they placed facilities called \"yake\" (宅) in those lands in order to preside over agricultural management, armament, traffic, and trades. In early documents, the terms \"yake\" and \"tatokoro\" were used almost interchangeably to refer to those administrative facilities, and so \"tatokoro\" are thought to have had functions similar to \"yake\". Before long, however, the meaning of \"tatokoro\" was extended to represent not only the originally indicated administrative facilities but also the cultivated land which they administrated.\n\nNew policies of the central government during the Nara period, initially designed to encourage reclamation, played an important role in the development of \"shōen\". The land policy of the ritsuryō was called handen-shūju-sei (班田収受制), and was similar to Chinese equal-field land system (均田制), but there was a difference in the treatment of reclaimed fields. If someone reclaimed wasteland in Japan at that time, the field would be dispossessed and he could not cultivate the field; while if someone reclaimed a field in China, he could cultivate the land providing that the field was smaller than legally prescribed dimensions. Therefore, there was no incentive to reclaim land and develop new fields, and little land was reclaimed although the population was steadily increasing. The shortage of fields thus became a social and economic problem. To solve this, in 723 the central government promulgated the law of \"sanze-isshin-hō\" (三世一身法), which promoted reclamation. This law allowed one to cultivate any field one reclaimed, and if certain conditions were satisfied, the fields reclaimed by one's parents or grandparents. Twenty years later, in 743 the central government promulgated a further law promoting reclamation, called \"konden-einen-shizai-hō\" (墾田永年私財法) which provided for the succession of the right to cultivate reclaimed fields in perpetuity. This law resulted in massive reclamation by wealthy people, and this reclamation in turn had a significant impact on the development of \"shōen\".\n\nOne feature that distinguishes early or shoki-shōen from medieval shōen is their manner of formation. Most shoki-shōen were established by a Buddhist temple or a central noble by obtaining ownership of either of two kinds of paddy fields: those that had existed prior to the temple's or noble's ownership; and those that were reclaimed under the order of the temple or the noble which ruled a shōen. Shōen composed primarily of newly reclaimed land characterized shoki shōen, and accordingly shoki-shōen are sometimes called kondenchi-kei-shōen (墾田地系荘園, lit. 'estates of reclaimed fields.').\n\nAnother feature of shoki-shōen is annual rental system of paddy fields. There were no permanent inhabitants of shoki-shōen and the fields of shoki-shōen did not have regular cultivators, so cultivation rights were rented out on a contract of a year to peasants who inhabited the neighborhood around the shōen. Therefore, it was indispensable to recruit help of peasants, who did nearly all the work of cultivation, in order to ensure stable labor force for cultivation and reclamation of new fields. An owner of a shoki-shōen often utilized the local government system of \"Daijō-kan\", \"kuni\" and \"kōri\" to meet this need; an owner of shoki-shōen who usually had been assigned by the central government as a \"kokushi\" (国司, a head or officer of \"kuni\") appointed a local chief of the peasants to be a \"gunji\" (郡司, a head or officer of kōri) to recruit and administer labor for the shōen.\n\nMedieval or chūsei-shōen are different from shoki-shōen mainly in existence of \"shōmin\" (荘民, peasants permanently residing on shōen land) and in the power the owner of the shōen had over the shōmin. While shoki-shōen did not have any shōmin and the owner's rule of cultivators was weaker than that of the government, chūsei-shōen had shōmin and most of the cultivators were shōmin, and the shōen owner's rule became more powerful than that of the government. The owner of a shōen could expel peasants who were not obedient to him from the shōen, and could promulgate his own penal codes for criminal offenses or treason in order to ensure this control over the shōmin. That is to say shōen owners, who originally cultivated influence with the government in the capital during the Nara period, came to discard the connection with the central government and to cultivate their power over local peasants.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of chūsei-shōen are their exemptions from some kinds of tax imposed by the central government. In the middle or the end of the Heian period there were two types of tax. One type of tax was corvee labor under the supervision of \"kuni\", and the other was a tax on farm products (about three percent of rice or other farm products). To evade these taxes, peasants wanted to be ruled and protected by the shōen owners, which was usually a politically influential Buddhist temple, Shinto shrine or court noble. To achieve this protection by the shōen owners, peasants donated the nominal land ownership of the fields they cultivated to shōen owners. These fields, nominally donated to the ownership of a shōen were historically called . Then the \"shōen\" owners who received \"donated lands\" from the \"shōmin\" peasant populace negotiated with the \"kokushi\" or directly with the central government and achieved tax exempt status. Most chūsei-shōen gathered vast amounts fields through the process of receiving donated lands from peasants as kishinchi. In this sense, chūsei-shōen is sometimes called kishinchi-kei-shōen (寄進地系荘園, lit. \"estates of donated fields\").\n\nMeanwhile, there also appeared shōen which gathered territory by depriving peasants of land ownership. In some cases, shōen owners would demand tribute from peasants cultivating neighboring fields and if the peasants could not pay that tribute, the shōen confiscated the fields. In other cases, a peasant could not repay the rent for cultivation rights of shōen land, and the shōen owner who was the cultivator's creditor foreclosed on the cultivator's land rights as substitution of the credit, in which case the peasant became bound to the shōen as a shōmin, rather than a tenant cultivator. This kind of shōen is sometimes called konden-shūseki-shōen (墾田集積荘園, lit, \"estates of accumulated fields\").\n\nThere were several kinds of chūsei-shōen, and each kind of shōen had particular process of achieving exemption from tax:\n\n is shōen where exemption from \"so\" (租, a kind of tax, three percent of total harvest of rice) was allowed in official procedures. In the ritsuryō system, powerful Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples had the right to receive rice as support from the central government. Each shrines or temples were allotted particular fields to, and the rice was levied as \"so\" from peasants cultivating the allotted fields. In the 8th century in some shōen, semi-permanent land ownership of the fields and exemption from \"so\" in the fields was permitted by Daijō-kan, which administered exemption of tax, and the notified the owner of the fields about the permission using the document called the or \"charter\". Later the permission by \"Daijō-kan\" not for temples or shrines but for powerful noble was gradually increased.\n\n is shōen allowed exemption from \"so\" or other tribute in bempo or binho (便補) system. At that time \"kuni\" had an obligation to pay to shōen owner the benefits the amount of which was determined as to his dignity by the central government. Bempo system is a means usually used when \"kuni\" could not prepare the benefits since the taxation from peasants cultivating public fields did not function well; \"kuni\" transferred shōen owner its right of taxation from fields the dimensions of which was corresponding to the amount of the benefits. This field was usually selected, according to shōen owner's request, from fields which shōen owner had received from peasants as \"kishinchi\", and this means practical exemption from tax. This system was not admitted by the central government and a contract of bempo became invalid when the term of tenure of the kokushi who contracted was over. However, in most case the new kokushi could not refuse shōen owner's request of continuation of a contract because they felt sorry for accumulated debt of the delinquent benefits, which had not paid while bempo was performed as substitution of payment. Consequently, these fields were established as an area exempt from \"so\" or other tribute imposed by the central government.\n\nIn the 10th and 11th century kokumen-shō was rapidly increased, and in 1040 the central government was not able to continue ignoring kokumen-shō and finally explicitly prohibited \"kuni\" 's new permission of exemption of tax. This ordinance is now called \"chōkyū-shōen-seiri-rei\" (\"The Order for Disposal of Shōen in Chōkyū Era\" in Japanese).\n\n is a general term of variant labor imposed to peasants as tax by the government from the middle to the end of the Heian period, and is shōen allowed exemption of rinjizōyaku. There were two main processes of formation of rinjizōyaku-menjo-shōen. One was the process of shōen owner's negotiation with kokushi; shōen owner abandoned the right of using a part of labor force of rinjizōyaku and instead achieved exemption from rinjizōyaku of peasants living in particular area. The other is the process of bempo system. However, repeated exemption of rinjizōyaku resulted in the shortage of kishinchi of some shōen owners which was remained not exempt from rinjizōyaku. While practicing bempo, if all the kishinchi of the shōen owner was exempt from rinjizōyaku, shōen owner was provided with the right of using labor force of particular public fields. This resulted in absorption of public fields into shōen territory, and in the 11th century new exemption from rinjizōyaku of fields which had neither exemption of \"so\" nor that of other tributes was prohibited.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Ōnin War, the power of the \"shōen\" disappeared as new \"daimyō\" came in control of the court. These daimyo dissolved or destroyed the \"shōen\", preferring to keep the peasants under their direct control, and effectively making them serfs in return for their protection.\n\n\n"}

The influence of Indian culture into these areas was given the term \"indianization\". French archaeologist, George Coedes, defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, Hinduism and Buddhism and the Sanskrit dialect. \n\nThere was pan-Southeast Asia sanskritisation directly due to marine silk route trade with Indian traders as well as via the Indianised Indonesian-Malay Srivijaya and Madjapahit empires. These were Hindu-Buddhist empires, which towards the end were Islamized in a gradual process of series of wars waged by Brunei Sultanate's princes. This led to introduction of Arabic loan words during the Indianised polities era though most of Islamic sultanate remained culturally more Indianised than Arabized. Brunei sultanate itself shrunk dramatically during the european colonial era. This resulted in a stoppage and reduction of arabization (language transmission) of Philippines due to the replacement of Islam and the remnants of Hindu-Buddhist polities with the christianization during Spanish-Catholic colonial era.\n\nLaguna Copperplate Inscription (LCI) is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines. The copperplate indicate the presence of writing and of written records at the time, and the earliest proof of Philippines language. The subject matter proves conclusively that a developed society with traders, rulers and international trading existed in the Philippines prior to the Spanish colonization. The references to the Chief of Medang Kingdom in Indonesia imply that there were cultural and trade links with empires and territories in other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, particularly Srivijaya. Prior to the deciphering of the LCI, Philippine history was traditionally considered to begin at 1521, with the arrival of Magellan and his chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta. The words are a mixture of mostly Sanskrit along with some Old Malay, Old Javanese and Old Tagalog. History could not be derived from pre-colonial records because such records typically did not survive: most of the writing was done on perishable bamboo or leaves. Because the deciphering of the LCI made it out to be the earliest written record of the islands that would later become the Philippines, the LCI moved the boundary between Philippine history and prehistory back 600 years. It is a legal document with the inscribed date of Saka era 822, corresponding to April 21, 900 AD. Antoon Postma deciphered the text and discovered that it identified the date of its creation as the \"\"Year of Sakya 822, month of Vaisakha.\"\" According to Jyotisha (Hindu astronomy), this corresponded with the year 900. It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of Old Malay containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between Old Javanese and Old Tagalog.\n\nSanskritization process saw the transmission of sanskrit as well as tamil loanwords which led to the emergence of Old Tagalog as a distinct language as well as the development of Indianised native scripts such as Baybayin various Indianised Suyat scripts. Modern Indianised Suyat scripts include Buhid script, Hanunoo script and Tagbanwa script. Earlier Kawi script also had the influence of Indianised Brahmi script.\n\nThis era of Christianization saw two major drivers of native language and script destruction, loanword borrowing from colonial languages ÷History added,and eventual replacement (of Old Tagalog). These were:\n\nForced or otherwise religion conversion and colonization have a double-edged direct impact on the development of anti-native sentiment among natives (disdain for own language, religion and culture), the adoption of sacred language of new faith and colonizers, and the abandonment of own language (e.g. Old Tagalog langage as well as the Indianised native scripts like Baybayin and Suyat scripts). This phase was also mired in the Spanish–Moro conflict and the History of Spanish slavery in the Philippines.\n\nAs in most Austronesian languages, the Sanskrit vocabulary incorporated into Tagalog are mostly borrowed indirectly via Malay or Javanese. Examples include:\n\nExamples:\n\nMany Malay loanwords entered the Tagalog vocabulary during pre-colonial times as Old Malay became the lingua franca of trade, commerce and diplomatic relations during the pre-colonial era of Philippine history as evidenced by the Laguna Copperplate Inscription of 900 AD and accounts of Pigafetta at the time of the Spanish arrival in the country five centuries later. Some Malay loanwords, such as \"bansa\" and \"guro\", are later additions to the Tagalog language during the first half of the 19th century. Said words were proposals by the late linguist Eusebio T. Daluz to be adopted for further development of the Tagalog language and eventually found widespread usage among the lettered segment of the Tagalog-speaking population. \n\nThere are very few words in Tagalog that are identified as Arabic or Persian in origin. According to Jean-Paul Potet, there are 60 Tagalog words that are identified with reasonable confidence as derived from Arabic or Persian, half of which are probably (roughly 23%) or unquestionably (roughly 26%) borrowed indirectly through Malay. The other half of the identified loanwords are directly derived from Arabic or Persian, like for example the word \"gumamela\" (the local Tagalog term for the \"Hibiscus\" flowers, derived from Arabic جميلة meaning \"beautiful\"). The table below shows the different Arabic loanwords, including the archaic and poetic ones, incorporated into the Tagalog lexicon. If an Arabic loanword is considered to be borrowed through the mediation of Malay, the intermediate Malay term is also specified.\n\nSeveral Spanish loanwords incorporated into Tagalog have origins in the Arabic language. Examples include \"alahas\" (meaning \"jewel\", from Sp. \"alhaja\" and ultimately from Arabic حاجة meaning \"necessary or valuable thing\"), \"albayalde\" (meaning white lead, from Sp. \"albayalde\" and ultimately from Arabic بياض meaning \"white\" or \"whiteness\"), \"alkansiya\" (meaning \"piggy bank\", from Sp. \"alcancía\" and ultimately from Arabic كنز meaning \"treasure\"), \"alkatsopas\" (meaning artichoke, from Sp. \"alcachofa\" and ultimately from Arabic الخُرْشُوف‎), \"almires\" (meaning \"small mortar\", from Sp. \"almirez\" and ultimately from Arabic مهراس), \"asapran\" (meaning saffron, from Sp. \"azafrán\" from Persian \"zarparan\" meaning \"gold strung”), \"baryo\" (meaning \"village\", from Sp. \"barrio\" and ultimately from Arabic بَرِّي), \"kapre\" (a Filipino mythological creature, from Sp. \"cafre\" and ultimately from Arabic كَافِر), \"kisame\" (meaning \"ceiling\", from Sp. \"zaquizamí\" and ultimately from Arabic سقف في السماء meaning \"ceiling in the sky\"), etc. The table below does not include these numerous Hispano-Arabic terms as it will only focus on those loanwords which are directly borrowed from Arabic or Persian, or indirectly borrowed through Malay.\"\n\nMany of the Chinese loanwords in Tagalog are derived from Hokkien, the Southern Chinese variety spoken in the Philippines. Most of the 163 Hokkien-derived terms collected and analyzed by Gloria Chan-Yap are fairly recent and do not appear in the earliest Spanish dictionaries of Tagalog. Many of the Hokkien-derived loanwords like \"pancit\" entered the Tagalog vocabulary during the Spanish colonial era when the Philippines experienced an increased influx of Chinese immigrants (mostly from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong in Southern China) as Manila became an international entrepôt with the flourishing of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade. Attractive economic opportunities boosted Chinese immigration to Spanish Manila and the new Chinese settlers brought with them their skills, culinary traditions and language, with the latter then influencing the native languages of the Philippines in the form of loanwords, most of which are related to cookery.\n\nPhilippines have colonized or occupied by Spanish, Japanese and then USA. Following sections have been listed in the chronological order of the occupation because the colonization was the most expedient facilitator of the loanwords transmission. \n\nThe Filipino language incorporated Spanish loanwords as a result of 333 years of contact with the Spanish language. In their review of a Pilipino-English dictionary, Llamzon and Thorpe (1972) point out that 33% of word roots are of Spanish origin. An example is the sentence below in which Spanish–derived words are in italics (original in parentheses):\n\nThe adoption of the Abakada alphabet in 1940 changed the spelling of most of the Spanish loanwords present in the Filipino language. The loanwords derived from the Spanish language have their original spellings indigenized according to the rules of the Abakada alphabet. Examples include:\n\nOther loanwords derived from the Spanish language underwent spelling and pronunciation changes. Vowel changes can be observed to some of the Spanish words upon adoption into the Filipino language. For example, an /i/ to /a/ vowel shift can be observed in the Filipino word \"paminta\", which came from the Spanish word \"pimienta\". A rare vowel change from /e/ to /u/ can be observed in the words \"unano\" (from Sp. \"enano\") and \"umpisa\" (from Sp. \"empezar\"). Other words derived from Spanish underwent vowel deletion upon adoption into the Filipino language, such as the words \"pusta\" (from Sp. \"apostar\"), \"tarantado\" (from Sp. \"atarantado\"), \"kursonada\" (from Sp. \"corazonada\"), \"Pasko\" (from Sp. \"Pascua\") and \"labi\" (from Sp. \"labio\"). Consonant shifts can also be observed to some of the Spanish words upon their adoption into the Filipino language. The [r] to [l] consonant shift can be observed in the following words:\n\nThe loss of the /l/ phoneme can be observed in the Filipino word \"kutson\" derived from the Spanish \"colchón\". The loss of the /t/ phoneme can be observed in the Filipino words \"talino\" (intelligence or wisdom, from Sp. \"talento\") and tina (dye, from Sp. \"tinta\"). Some Spanish-derived words have also undergone consonant or syllable deletion upon introduction to Tagalog like in the case of \"limos\" (from Sp. \"limosna\"), \"masyado\" (from Sp. \"demasiado\"), \"posas\" (from Sp. \"esposas\"), \"restawran\" (from Sp. \"restaurante\"), \"riles\" (rail, railway or railroad; from Sp. \"carriles\"), \"sindi\" (from Sp. third-person singular present tense conjugation of the verb \"encender\") and \"sintunado\" (from Sp. \"desentonado\").\n\nThe Spanish digraph [ll] is pronounced by the Spaniards as /j/ during the Renaissance era and this reflected on the pronunciation and the spelling of Spanish-derived loanwords in Tagalog introduced before the 19th century, where the digraph [ll] becomes [y] in Tagalog. Such is the case of the words \"barya\" (from Sp. \"barilla\"), \"kabayo\" (from Sp. \"caballo\"), \"kutamaya\" (from. Sp. \"cota de malla\"), \"lauya\" (a stew of meat and vegetables, from Sp. \"la olla\"), \"sibuyas\" (from Sp. \"cebollas\") and \"tabliya\" or \"tablea\" (from Sp. \"tablilla de chocolate\"). Spanish loanwords in which the digraph [ll] is pronounced as /lj/ in Tagalog were probably introduced (or reintroduced) during the 19th century by educated Peninsulares. Examples include \"apelyido\" (from Sp. \"apellido\"), \"balyena\" (from Sp. \"ballena\"), \"kalye\" (from Sp. \"calle\"), \"kutsilyo\" (from Sp. \"cuchillo\"), \"makinilya\" (from Sp. \"maquinilla de escribir\"), \"sepilyo\" (from Sp. \"cepillo de dientes\"), \"silya\" (from Sp. \"silla\") and \"sigarilyo\" (from Sp. \"cigarrillo\"). There are also rare cases of Tagalog doublets coming from the same Spanish etymological root which exhibit both the influences of the Renaissance /j/ and the latter /λ/ sounds, like in the case of the Tagalog word pair \"laryo\" and \"ladrilyo\", both from Sp. \"ladrillo\". There are also instances of the Spanish digraph [ll] being transformed into [l] upon adoption by Tagalog. Such is the case of the following words: \"kulani\" (lymph node, from Sp. \"collarín\"), \"kursilista\" (from Sp. \"cursillista\") and \"úling\" (coal, soot or charcoal; from Sp. \"hollín\").\n\nVestigial influences of Old and Middle Spanish voiceless palato-alveolar fricative /ʃ/ are evident in some of the Spanish-derived loanwords in Tagalog, where the /ʃ/ sound is transformed into the Tagalog /s/. Examples include \"sabon\" (from Sp. \"jabón\", pronounced as /ʃaˈbon/ in Middle Spanish), \"sugal\" (to gamble, from Sp. \"jugar\", pronounced as /ʃuˈgar/ in Middle Spanish) and \"tasa\" (to sharpen, from Sp. \"tajar\", pronounced as /taˈʃar/ in Middle Spanish). Loanwords which have the pronunciation that reflects the transition from Middle Spanish /ʃ/ to Modern Spanish /x/ are also present in Tagalog. The Modern Spanish /x/ sound is rendered in Tagalog as [h]. Example cases include \"ahedres\" (from Sp. \"ajedrez\"), \"anghel\" (from Sp. \"ángel\"), \"halaya\" (from Sp. \"jalea\"), \"hardin\" (from Sp. \"jardín\"), \"hepe\" (police chief, from Sp. \"jefe\"), \"kahera\" (female cashier, from Sp. \"cajera\"), \"kahero\" (male cashier, from Sp. \"cajero\") and \"kahon\" (from Sp. \"cajón\"). There are also rare cases of doublets that exhibit influences of both the Middle Spanish /ʃ/ and Modern Spanish /x/ like for example in the case of Tagalog \"muson\" and \"muhon\" (both from Sp. \"mojón).\"\n\nAnother one is \"maámong kordero\" (from Sp. \"amo\" & \"cordero\"). Combined together, it conveys the description of a meek, tame, harmless human with Tagalog adjective prefix and suffix added. The compound word \"batya't palo–palo\", a must word in the laundry business where many Spanish words proliferate. The words were taken from the Spanish \"batea\" for \"washing tub\" and \"palo\" for \"stick\" or \"beater\", something a typical Filipino might think had no Spanish provenance at all. Others are \"umpisa\" (\"empieza\"), \"pulubi\" (\"pobre\"), \"pader\" (\"pared\").\n\nSome have acquired an entirely new meaning, such as \"kursonada\" (\"corazonada\", originally meaning '\"hunch\"), which means \"object of desire\"; \"sospetsoso\" (\"sospechoso\") is the \"suspicious person\" and not the \"suspect\" as in the original; \"insekto\" (\"insecto\"), which still means \"insect\" but also refers to a \"pesty clownish person\"; or even sige (\"sigue\"), a Spanish word for \"continue\" or \"follow\", which is now widely understood to mean \"all right\" or \"go ahead\".\n\nOthers use Spanish prefixes and/or suffixes, combined from Tagalog or other languages, without which the word can not be completed and convey its meaning. For example, \"pakialamero\" (from Tag. \"pakialam\", \"to meddle\" and the Sp. suffix \"–ero\", masculine subject); same as \"majongero\" (\"mahjong\", a Chinese word and the Sp. suffix \"–ero\"). \"Daisysiete\" is a corruption and portmanteau of the English \"daisy\" and the Spanish \"diecisiete\" (\"seventeen\"), now meaning a sweet and sexually desirable underaged (below 18, hence the number) female. \"Bastusing katawán\" (Sp.: \"basto\" & Tag.: \"katawan\") is an example of a two-word term for a bombshell body\n\nEven after the Spanish era, Tagalog is still being influenced by Spanish as new words are coined, albeit along its own terms, viz., \"alaskadór\" (\"Alaska\" + Sp. suffix '–ador'); \"barkada\" (from Sp.: \"barca\",\"boat\" to \"clique\"); \"bérde\" (\"verde\"=\"green\", nuanced to \"toilet humour\" or \"blue joke\"); which are not readily understood in Spain or any Latin American country. In a strange twist, even if Filipinos have a chance to Tagalized words using foreign words, currently English—their most accessible influence—they coin words in a uniquely Hispanizing way i.e. \"boksingero\" (from Eng. \"boxing\") instead of using the Spanish \"boxeador\". Or \"basketbolista\" (from Eng. \"basketball\"), instead of borrowing from Spanish \"baloncesto\" to make it say \"baloncestista\" or \"baloncestador\" (although \"basketbolista\" and \"basketbolero\" are often used in Latin America due to the local influence of American English).\n\nHere are some examples of Spanish–derived Tagalog words in the following format:\nWord (Etymology – Original Definition/s if different from Nuanced Definition. = Derivative Definition if Compound Words) – Nuanced Definition. Shared Definition precedes Nuanced Definition if both exist.\nNote that the first syllable of loanwords from Spanish that start with /aw/ are also sometimes pronounced and spelled /o/ (e.g. 'otonomiya' rather than 'awtonomiya') due to the predominance of pronunciation of loanwords from English.\n\nAlthough the overall influence of Spanish on the morphosyntax of the Tagalog language was minimal, there are fully functional Spanish-derived words that have produced syntactic innovations on Tagalog. Clear influences of Spanish can be seen in the morphosyntax of comparison and the existence of Spanish-derived modals and conjunctions, as will be discussed in more detail below.\n\nAll of the interrogative words used in Tagalog are non-Spanish in origin, with the exception of \"kumusta\". The word \"kumusta\" is derived from the Spanish \"¿cómo está?\" and it functions as a Tagalog interrogative word used as a substitute for an adjective of quality or condition equivalent to the English \"how\". \"Kumusta\" can also be used as a greeting (similar to English \"Hello!\") or as a verb with the meaning of \"to greet\" or \"to say hello\".\n\nTagalog has several comparative markers that are etymologically derived from Spanish. The particle \"mas\" (meaning \"more\", from Sp. \"más\"), in conjunction with the various Tagalog counterparts of the English \"than\" (\"kaysa\" + \"sa\"-marker, \"sa\", \"kay\"), is used as a comparative marker of non-equality. Another comparative marker of non-equality is \"kumpara\" (from Sp. \"comparado\"), usually followed with the appropriate \"sa\"-marker and used as the Tagalog equivalent of the English \"compared to\". Lastly, the word \"pareho\" (from Sp. \"parejo\"), commonly employed with the Tagalog linker \"-ng\", is used as a comparative marker of equality.\n\nThere are several Spanish-derived words that have acquired function as modals upon adoption in Tagalog. Tagalog modals, including those that are etymologically derived from Spanish, can be classified into two main groups: words realizing \"deontic modality\" (\"i.e\" modals concerned with expressing inclination, obligation and ability) and words realizing \"epistemic modality\" (\"i.e.\" modals concerned with degrees of reality).\n\nDeontic modality in Tagalog is realized through words which are grammaticized by Paul Schachter and Fe T. Otanes as \"pseudo-verbs\". An example of a Spanish-derived Tagalog deontic modal is \"gusto\" (from Sp. \"gusto\"), which is used to denote preference or desire. \"Gusto\" is considered to be more commonly used than its other counterparts such as \"nais\" or \"ibig\", since the latter two are both perceived as more formal than \"gusto\" and are more frequently used in writing than in speech. Another example is \"puwede\" (from Sp. \"puede\"), which can be translated in English as \"can\" and is thus used to express permission or ability. The word \"puwede\" co-exists with its non-Spanish-derived equivalent \"maaari\" and the two pseudo-verbs are deemed to have little semantic difference, with \"puwede\" only being considered usually as more colloquial and less formal than \"maaari\".\n\nEpistemic modality in Tagalog is realized through words functioning as adverbials. These words, when used as modals, are typically linked to the clause that they modalize through the Tagalog linker \"-ng\" or \"na\". An example of a Spanish-derived epistemic modal used for expressing high degree of probability is \"sigurado + -ng\" (from Sp. \"seguro\" + \"-ado\"), with the meaning of \"surely\" or \"certainly\", and is considered as a synonym of Tagalog \"tiyak\". The word \"siguro\" (from Sp. \"seguro\") is an epistemic modal marking moderate degree of probability, with the meaning of \"maybe\", \"probably\" or \"perhaps\". The word \"siguro\" is also identified by the linguist Ekaterina Baklanova as a Spanish-derived discourse marker in Tagalog, thus contrasting the claims of other scholars such as Patrick Steinkrüger that none of the numerous discourse markers in Tagalog are of Spanish origin. Similarly to Tagalog, the word \"siguro\" is also considered as an adverbial clitic in Cebuano and in Masbateño. \"Posible + -ng\" (from Sp. \"posible\"), which can be translated to English as \"possibly\", is a Tagalog epistemic modal marking low degree of probability. Examples of Spanish-derived Tagalog epistemic modals marking excessive degree of intensity include \"masyado + -ng\" (from Sp. \"demasiado\") and \"sobra + -ng\" (from Sp. \"sobra\") while \"medyo\" (from Sp. \"medio\") marks moderate degree of intensity.\n\nSeveral conjunctions in Tagalog have Spanish-derived etymological roots. The Tagalog disjunctive conjunction \"o\" (from Sp. \"o\", meaning \"or\") has completely substituted the old Tagalog equivalent \"kun\", rendering the latter obsolete. Two Spanish-derived counter-expectational adversative conjunctions used in Tagalog are \"pero\" (from Sp. \"pero\") and \"kaso\" (from Sp. \"caso\"), both of which are considered as synonyms of the Tagalog counterparts \"ngunit\", \"subalit\", etc. The Tagalog \"ni\" (from Sp. \"ni\") can be used as a negative repetitive conjunction, similar to the English \"neither...nor\" construction. When not repeated, \"ni\" assumes a scalar focus value stripped off of all its conjunction function, translatable to English as \"not even\". \"Basta\" (from Sp. \"basta\"), when used as a conditional conjunction, assumes a meaning similar to English \"as long as\" or \"provided that\". \"Maski\" (from Sp. \"mas que\") is a synonym of Tagalog \"kahit\" and both are used as Tagalog concessive conjunctions. \"Porke\" (from Sp. \"porque\") assumes the function of emphatic causal conjunction in Tagalog and it is used to express an ironic or critical attitude, translatable to English as \"just because\" or \"only because\". The Tagalog \"puwera kung\" (from Sp. \"fuera\") is used as a negative exceptive conditional conjunction, translatable in English as \"unless\" or \"except if\". The Tagalog \"oras na\" (from Sp. \"hora\") is a temporal conjunction which can be translated in English as \"the moment that\". The Tagalog \"imbes na\" (from Sp. \"en vez\") is used as an implicit adversative conjunction and it can be translated in English as \"instead of\". The Tagalog \"para\" (from Sp. \"para\"), when used to introduce verb-less or basic-form predicates, assumes the role of a purposive conjunction. However, if followed by the appropriate dative \"sa\"-marker, \"para\" assumes the role of a benefactive marker in Tagalog.\n\nUpon adoption into Tagalog, a number of Spanish-derived terms underwent a process of semantic shift or change in meaning. A loanword is said to have undergone a semantic shift if its meaning in Tagalog deviates from the original meaning of the word in the source language (in this case, Spanish). A type of semantic shift is the so-called \"semantic narrowing\", which is a linguistic phenomenon in which the meaning of a Spanish-derived word acquires a less general or inclusive meaning upon adoption into Tagalog. Semantic narrowing occurs when a word undergoes specialization of usage. For example, the word \"kuryente\" (meaning \"electricity\" or \"electric current\") comes from the Spanish word \"corriente\", which is a general term to refer to any current, whether electric or not. Upon adoption of the word \"corriente\" into Tagalog as \"kuryente\", it underwent a semantic narrowing and its usage became restricted to refer only to an electric current, unlike its Spanish counterpart. Another example of a semantic narrowing is the Tagalog word \"ruweda\" (meaning \"Ferris wheel\"), a term derived from the Spanish word \"rueda\" which refers to any kind of wheel. Upon adoption into Tagalog, \"ruweda\" underwent usage specialization and its meaning became restricted to the Ferris wheel.\n\nSemantic shift may also occur through semantic interference by another language, usually the English language. This phenomenon can result into reinterpretation of a Spanish-derived term by attributing to it an English meaning upon assimilation into Tagalog. An example is the Tagalog word \"libre\", which is derived from the Spanish translation of the English word \"free\", although used in Tagalog with the meaning of \"without cost or payment\" or \"free of charge\", a usage which would be deemed incorrect in Spanish as the term \"gratis\" would be more fitting. Another example is the Tagalog word \"iskiyerda\", derived from the Spanish term \"izquierda\" meaning \"left\" as opposed to \"right\", although used in Tagalog with the meaning of \"to leave\".\n\nHere is the list of Spanish-derived words which underwent semantic shift upon assimilation into Tagalog:\n\nSome of the Spanish loanwords in Tagalog appear in their pluralized form, marked with -s or -es. However, in Tagalog, such words are not considered as plural and when they are pluralized in Tagalog, they need to be pluralized in the way that Tagalog pluralizes native words, i.e., by placing the pluralization marker \"mga\" before the word. For example, the word \"butones\" (meaning button used in clothing, from Sp. \"botones\") is considered singular in Tagalog and its plural form is \"mga butones\".\n\nSeveral Spanish verbs are also adopted into Tagalog. Most of them are in their infinitive form characterized by the deletion of their final /r/, like for example in the case of the Tagalog \"intindi\" (to understand) derived from the Spanish verb \"entender\". This feature is also found in Chavacano verbs which have a Spanish origin and it can be argued that an already restructured form of Spanish (Chavacano or a pidgin) was the origin of these Tagalog words. A list of these loanwords can be viewed below.\n\nAlternatively, upon adoption into Tagalog, the final /r/ of the Spanish verbs in their infinitive form becomes /l/. Such is the case of the following loanwords: \"almusal\" (to have breakfast, from Sp. \"almorzar\"), \"dasal\" (from Sp. \"rezar\"), \"dupikal\" (from Sp. \"repicar\"), \"kasal\" (from Sp. \"casar\"), \"kumpisal\" (from Sp. \"confesar\"), \"minindal\" (from Sp. \"merendar\"), \"pasyal\" (from Sp. \"pasear\") and \"sugal\" (from Sp. \"jugar\"). In some cases, the final /r/ remains unaltered in the Tagalog form like in the case of \"andar\" (to set in action or motion; from Sp. \"andar\"), \"asar\" (to annoy or to verbally irritate; from Sp. \"asar\") and \"pundar\" (to establish or to save money for something; from Sp. \"fundar\").\n\nConjugated Spanish verbs are also adopted into Tagalog. Examples include: \"pára\" (from Sp. \"parar\"), \"pása\" (from Sp. \"pasar\"), \"puwede\" (from Sp. \"poder\"), \"tíra\" (from Sp. \"tirar\") and \"sige\" (from Sp. \"seguir\"). \"Imbiyerna\" (meaning to annoy or to irritate someone) is derived from the Spanish verb \"infernar\" (meaning to irritate or to provoke) and was allegedly coined by Ricardo \"Rikki\" Dalu, originally to describe the hellish feeling and the frustration he experienced when attending Spanish classes. In some cases, the conjugated verbs are combined with another word to form Tagalog morphemes like in the case of the following words: \"asikaso\" (from the combination of Sp. \"hacer\" and Sp. \"caso\"), \"balewala\" or \"baliwala\" (from the combination of Sp. \"valer\" and Tag. \"wala\"), \"etsapwera\" (from the combination of Sp. \"echar\" and Sp. \"fuera\") and \"kumusta\" (from the combination of Sp. \"cómo\" and Sp. \"estar\").\n\nSome Tagalog compound terms are actually formed through a combination of a native Tagalog term and an etymologically Spanish term, like in the case of the idiomatic expression \"balat-sibuyas\" (a term referring to a person's easiness to be offended), which is a combination of the Tagalog \"balat\" and Spanish \"cebolla\". The linguist Ekaterina Baklanova distinguishes at least two types of Spanish-Tagalog compound terms: \"hybrid loanwords\" or \"mixed-borrowings\" are partially translated Spanish terms which are adopted into Tagalog, \"e.g.\" \"karnerong-dagat\" (derived from the Spanish term \"carnero marino\", meaning \"seal\") and \"anemonang-dagat\" (derived from the Spanish term \"anémona de mar\", meaning \"sea anemone\"), while \"hybrid neologisms\" are new terms invented by Filipinos with use of some native and already assimilated Spanish-derived material, \"e.g.\" \"pader-ilog\", meaning \"embankment\", derived from the combination of the Tagalog word \"ilog\" (meaning \"river\") and Spanish word \"pared\" (meaning \"wall\" and adopted in Tagalog as the word \"pader\").\n\nBelow is the list of some Spanish-Tagalog hybrid compound terms. Because of the lack of standardization, some of the compound terms listed below are written differently (\"i.e.\" without the hyphen) in other Tagalog-based literature. For example, while the term \"sirang-plaka\" is usually encountered in many Tagalog-based works without the hyphen, there are also some instances of the term being written with the hyphen like in the case of one of the books written by the Chairman of the Commission on the Filipino Language Virgilio Almario, entitled \"Filipino ng mga Filipino: mga problema sa ispeling, retorika, at pagpapayaman ng wikang pambansa\". Another example is the term \"takdang-oras\", which can also be encountered in the literature without the hyphen. As a rule, a hybrid compound term below will be hyphenated if it has at least one instance of it being written with the hyphen in Tagalog-based literary works.\n\nAmerican occupation of Philippines was a key driver of adoption of English language and loan words.\n\nEnglish has been used in everyday Tagalog conversation. This kind of conversation is called Taglish. English words borrowed by Tagalog are mostly modern and technical terms, but English words are also used for short usage (many Tagalog words translated from English are very long) or to avoid literal translation and repetition of the same particular Tagalog word. English makes the second largest vocabulary of Tagalog after Spanish. In written language, English words in a Tagalog sentence are written as they are, but they are sometimes written in Tagalog phonetic spelling. Here are some examples:\n\nThere are very few Tagalog words that are derived from Japanese, transmission of which mainly commenced from the Japanese occupation of Philippines. Many of them are introduced as recently as the twentieth century like \"tansan\" (bottle cap, from the Japanese 炭酸 which originally means refers to soda and carbonated drinks) and \"karaoke\" (from the Japanese カラオケ, literally means \"empty orchestra\") although there are very few Japanese words that appear in the earliest Spanish dictionaries of Tagalog such as \"katana\" (Japanese sword, from the Japanese かたな with the same meaning).\n\nSome Filipino jokes are based on comical reinterpretation of Japanese terms as Tagalog words like for example in the case of \"otousan\" (from the Japanese お父さん meaning \"father\") which is reinterpreted as \"utusan\" (meaning \"servant\" or \"maid\") in Tagalog. As for the Tagalog word \"Japayuki\", it refers to the Filipino migrants who flocked to Japan starting in the 1980s to work as entertainers and it is a portmanteau of the English word \"Japan\" and the Japanese word \"yuki\" (or 行き, meaning \"going\" or \"bound to\").\n\nTagalog gained Nahuatl words through Spanish from the Galleon trade with Mexico during the Hispanic era.\n\nHere are some examples:\n"}

Although he was most associated with football, he covered a number of other sports for ITV, notably golf.\n\nMontford was raised in Greenock and was a lifelong supporter of local football club Greenock Morton.\n\nMontford worked as both a print journalist and radio broadcaster before joining Scottish Television in August 1957 as a continuity announcer. He was then chosen to present STV's new sports programme, \"Scotsport\" (originally \"Sports Desk\"), where he remained as anchorman for 32 years. In all, he hosted over 2,000 editions of the programme. During his time on \"Scotsport\", Montford became famous for his trademark checkered pattern sports jackets, and some classic lines of football commentary, including \"What a Stramash!\" and \"Disaster for Scotland!\" \n\nHe also presented the Scottish version of \"World of Sport\" which was broadcast under the \"Scotsport\" banner.\n\nDuring the 1978 FIFA World Cup, a technical fault with the feed from Argentina prevented ITV from broadcasting Hugh Johns' commentary on the Scotland-Peru game, so Montford's commentary, originally only intended for Scottish viewers, was used on the entire network (the same fault affected the BBC in reverse, with Scottish viewers having to listen to David Coleman instead of Archie MacPherson).\n\nMontford's last \"Scotsport\" programme was live coverage of the 1989 Scottish Cup Final. After retiring from television, Montford continued to comment on Scottish football, both in the national press and in the matchday programme at Morton. In 1990, he narrated the film documentary \"Scotland: The World Cup Story\". In late 2010, Montford served as an occasional commentator on the Greenock Morton webcast.\n\nIn May 2010, Montford received the SPFA Special Merit award for his services to football broadcasting and journalism alongside fellow broadcaster Archie Macpherson. He died aged 85 on 26 November 2014.\n\nHe served as a director of Greenock Morton for several years under the chairmanship of his close friend Douglas Rae. After stepping down as a director, Montford continued his affiliation with the club as an Honorary Vice-President.\n\nIn 1974, Montford was elected as Rector of the University of Glasgow, the first sports journalist to receive the honour. He remained in the position until 1977.\n\nMontford wrote a column for Scottish golf magazine, \"Bunkered\". His recollections of some of golf's greatest players, moments, and tournaments were popular with the magazine's readers and he was the title's longest-serving regular contributor.\n"}

{"id": "1862715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862715", "title": "Pereskia", "text": "Pereskia\n\nPereskia, as traditionally circumscribed, is a genus of 17 tropical species and varieties of cacti that do not look much like other types of cacti, having substantial leaves and thin stems. They originate from the region between Brazil and Mexico. Members of this genus are usually referred to as lemon vines, rose cacti or leaf cacti, though the latter also refers to the genus \"Epiphyllum\". The genus is named after Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, a 16th-century French botanist.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies have shown that species traditionally assigned to \"Pereskia\" fall into two clades, so that the genus is paraphyletic (i.e. it does not comprise all the descendants of a common ancestor). In 2013, it was suggested that eight species be moved to the genus \"Leuenbergeria\", with the other nine species remaining in \"Pereskia\". This has been accepted by sources such as Plants of the World Online.\n\nSpecies of \"Pereskia\" generally resemble other types of plants, such as roses. \"Pereskia\" species have large, bright green, privet-like leaves and long spiny stems. Not always succulent plants, they can be classified as shrubs, climbing plants or slightly succulent trees. However, close examination shows spines developing from areoles, and the distinctive floral cup of the cactus family. Unlike \"Pereskiopsis\", \"Maihuenia, Quiabentia\" and \"Austrocylindropuntia\" which have persistent succulent leaves, when defined broadly \"Pereskia\" is the only cactus genus that has persistent non-succulent leaves. It is believed that the ancestor of all cacti resembled \"Pereskia\".\n\nPlants are leafy and spiny, treelike, shrubby, and often scrambling. Many species may be treelike or shrubby, 2–7 m high, but occasionally at 10 m. \"Pereskia aculeata\" forms clambering shrubs or climbing vines 3–10 m long. Roots are sometimes thickened and tuberous. Leaves are generally alternate, broad, flattened, deciduous, usually with petioles, 2–20 cm long. Areoles exist on the axils of the leaves, usually with wool, and bear spines and leaves. The young primary areoles on twigs normally have up to eight spines, while areoles on trunks usually have more (15 to 40, up to 120) straight, usually black spines of unequal length. Flowers are solitary, or sometimes in inflorescences of 2–15 flowers (\"P. aceulata\" can have 70, while \"P. grandiflora\" can have 10–30); the flowers are 2–8 cm in diameter, usually pink, rose, or purple, but sometimes orange, yellow, white, or cream. Fruits, 2–7 (or up to 10 cm) long, are solitary or in clusters. They are variable in shape, but generally oblong and/or pear-shaped. When mature, fruits usually become green or yellow-green but also orange, reddish, or brownish. Three species have very small, glossy black, and globose fruits, at 0.5 to 1.5 cm. Seeds are 2–7 mm large, obovate to kidney shaped, and glossy black.\n\nMost likely Charles Plumier collected the first \"Pereskia\" specimens from the Caribbean between 1689 and 1695, but none of these have survived. Although Plumier described \"Pereskia\" in 1703, Linnaeus placed Plumier's two species in his \"Cactus\", as \"C. pereskia\" and \"C. portacifolius\". Philip Miller brought the original name back in 1754, and so by the rules of botanical nomenclature, he is credited as the author.\n\nThe genus \"Rhodocactus\" has been brought into synonymy with this genus, as well as different orthographic variants: \"Peirescia\" (orth. var.), \"Peireskia\" (orth. var.) and \"Perescia\" (orth. var.).\n\nA 2005 study suggested that the genus \"Pereskia\" was basal within the Cactaceae, and confirmed earlier suggestions that it was paraphyletic, i.e. did not include all the descendants of a common ancestor. The Bayesian consensus cladogram from this study is shown below.\n\nThe species studied divide into the two clades as shown below.\n\nA more recent 2011 study using fewer genes also found that \"Pereskia\" was divided into these two clades. In 2013, it was suggested that the two clades be recognized as distinct genera, \"Pereskia\" Clade A becoming \"Leuenbergeria\" and \"Pereskia\" Clade B becoming a more tightly circumscribed \"Pereskia\" sensu stricto.\n\nThe two clades of \"Pereskia\" sensu lato differ in their geographical distribution: with one exception, \"Leuenbergeria\" (Clade A) is found around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea whereas \"Pereskia\" s.s. (Clade B) occurs south of the Amazon Basin. Species of \"Leuenbergeria\" always lack two key features of the stem present in most of the remaining \"caulocacti\": like most non-cacti, their stems begin to form bark early in the plant's life and also lack stomata – structures which control the admission of air into a plant and hence control photosynthesis. By contrast, species of \"Pereskia\" s.s. typically delay forming bark and have stomata on their stems, thus giving the stem the potential to become a major organ for photosynthesis.\n\nThe two genera have been placed in separate subfamilies of the Cactaceae: \"Leuenbergeria\" being the sole genus in the subfamily Leuenbergerioideae, and \"Pereskia\" s.s. the sole genus in the subfamily Pereskioideae.\n\nSpecies recognized by International Cactaceae Systematics Group. (\"Anderson E. F.\", 2001)\n\nThe following species are now placed in the segregate genus \"Leuenbergeria\", for example by Plants of the World Online:\n\n\nMost of the species are found in dry forests or thorny scrub, in tropical climates with a dry season of two to five months. The two clades of \"Pereskia\" s.l. differ in their geographical distribution, with one exception.\n\nSpecies placed in \"Leuenbergeria\" (Clade A) are found on Pacific coastal area, around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.\n\n\"Pereskia lychnidiflora\" Pacific coastal area from southern Mexico to Costa Rica in lowland dry forest from sea level to 1000 m (3300 ft).\n\n\"Pereskia bleo\" Panama and Colombia along rivers and in secondary forests, from sea level to 500 m (1600 ft).\n\n\"Pereskia guamacho\" Drier regions of Colombia and Venezuela, from sea level to 800 m (2600 ft); possibly also the Dutch Antilles.\n\nCaribbean islands species.

Caatinga formation, Brazil, northeastern Minas Gerais and southern Bahia, at elevations of 300–700 m (980–2300 ft).\n\nSpecies remaining in \"Pereskia\" s.s. (Clade B) occur south of the Amazon Basin, in eastern part of Brazil, south to northern Uruguay and Argentina, Gran Chaco region, and lowlands and dry walleys on the Andes in Peru and Bolivia, though not on the Pacific side.\n\nBrazil lowlands, caatinga formation:\n\n\"Pereskia nemorosa\" Drier forests and woodlands in lowlands in southern Brazil, Paraguay, northeastern Argentina, and northwestern Uruguay region.\n\n\"Pereskia sacharosa\" The Gran Chaco including Mato Grosso region (Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay), and lowlands of the Andes in northwestern Argentina at elevations of 1000–2500 m.(3300–8200 ft).\n\n\"Pereskia diaz-romeroana\" Dry mountain valleys of central Bolivia at elevations of 1300–2000 m (4300–6600 ft).\n\n\"Pereskia weberiana\" Dry forests in the Bolivian Andean valleys of the Rio Beni, at elevations of 1100–1900 m (3600–6200 ft)\n\n\"Pereskia horrida\" Dry forest and brushland in the Peruan mountain valleys of the Maranon at elevations of 500-2100 (1600–6900 ft).\n\n\"Pereskia aculeata\" Northern, eastern, and southeastern South America, and Caribbean. From sea level to 1000 m (3300 ft). Introduced in United States, Mexico, South Africa and Australia.\n\nAccording to Anderson, Edward F. (2001) and Edwards, Erika J.; Nyffeler, Reto & Donoghue, Michael J. (2005).\n\nThe genus is not of great economic importance.\n\n\"Pereskia aculeata\" The fruit are edible, widely cultivated. Fruits containing numerous small seeds. It somewhat resembles the gooseberry in appearance and is of excellent flavor. This plant is a declared weed in South Africa.\n\n\"Pereskia guamacho\" The fruit are edible, collected from wild plants.\n\n\"Pereskia bleo\" The crushed leaves have been used to clarify drinking water.\n\n\"Pereskia lychnidiflora\" The spines are 12 cm long and have been used as needles in Guatemala.\n\n\"Pereskia grandifolia\" Cultivated for flowers.\n\nThe most common usage being as hedges; they are easily transplanted and quickly grow into an impenetrable thicket, as well as flowering prolifically.\n\n\"Pereskia aculeata\" In horticulture being more tolerant of moisture than more succulent cacti, they can be used as rootstock for grafting of \"Zygocactus\" to create miniature trees.\n\nAccording to Anderson, Edward F.

His great-great-grandfather was Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal, Lord Chief Justice (1829–1843), through whom Bosanquet was senior lineal representative of the ancient Scales barony, although he never sought to establish his claim to the title and a seat in the House of Lords.\n\nBosanquet was educated at several independent boarding schools: at Ashbury College in Rockcliffe Park in the city of Ottawa; Wellesley House School, in the seaside town of Broadstairs in Kent; and Winchester College, before going up to New College at the University of Oxford, where he read History.\n\nBosanquet was on the staff of ITN from its earliest days, initially as a sub-editor. He later reported from many parts of the world and was diplomatic correspondent for four years, before becoming one of its lead anchors during the late 1960s and 1970s, often working alongside Andrew Gardner, Leonard Parkin, Sandy Gall and, mostly late in his tenure, Alastair Burnet.\n\nHis partnership with Anna Ford on \"News at Ten\" was popular with viewers in the late 1970s. As Ford has since revealed, this rapport could prove distressing: on one occasion Bosanquet, having somehow discovered the birth-date of Ford's mother, wished her a \"happy birthday\" at the end of the broadcast, unaware that she had died some time previously. Ford recalled in 2007: \"Reggie was a dear. I mean, you wouldn't have chosen a man who had epilepsy, was an alcoholic, had had a stroke and wore a toupée to read the news, but the combination was absolute magic.\"\n\nAlthough held in considerable affection by the public (he was commonly addressed by family, friends and the media as \"Reggie\"), Bosanquet was not without his critics as a newsreader. At times he could appear puzzled by unfamiliar foreign names while his trademark slurred delivery fed contemporary suspicions that he was a heavy drinker. Such rumours became raw material for wags and comedy writers: Bosanquet acquired such nicknames as \"Reginald Beaujolais\", \"Reginald Boozalot\" and \"Reginald Boozatten\".\n\nBosanquet was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow in 1980, serving until 1984. He was a controversial choice; shortly after his election he hit the headlines when he turned up at an official reception late and drunk, and insulted various guests, including the Lord Provost of Glasgow (and his eventual successor as Rector) Michael Kelly.\n\nIn 1980, Bosanquet \"sang\" (or, more accurately, narrated the lyrics in the style of a newscast) on the disco single \"Dance with Me\". It was voted #1 in the Bottom 30 by listeners of British DJ Kenny Everett.\n\nBosanquet married three times and had two daughters, Abigail and Delilah. He died from pancreatic cancer on 27 May 1984, aged 51 and is buried at Putney Vale Cemetery. Bosanquet's death was overshadowed by that of comedian Eric Morecambe, who died the following morning, aged 58.\n\n"}

Their elder daughter Twinkle Khanna is an actress and a best selling author who is married to actor Akshay Kumar, while they also have a younger daughter Rinke Khanna.\n\nKhanna died on 18 July 2012, after a period of illness. He has been posthumously awarded India's third highest civilian honour, Padma Bhushan. He has also been honoured with a stamp and statue in his likeness, and a road renamed after him by the Prime Minister of India. In 2014, his biography \"Rajesh Khanna – The untold story of India's first Superstar\" by Yasser Usman was published by Penguin Books. In 2018, a one kilometre fitness trail in Lajpat Nagar National Park was named after Khanna, which was inaugurated by his wife Dimple Kapadia.\n\nRajesh Khanna was born on 29 December 1942, in Amritsar in the present-day state of Punjab, as Jatin Khanna. He was adopted and raised by Chunnilal Khanna and Leelawati Khanna, who were relatives of his biological parents. His father had migrated from West Punjab to Gali Tiwarian in Amritsar. His biological parents were Lala Hiranand Khanna and Chandrani Khanna. Lala worked as headmaster of the MC High School in Burewala (in present-day Vehari District, Punjab, Pakistan). His adoptive parents belonged to a family of railway contractors who had moved from Lahore to Bombay in 1935. Khanna lived in Saraswati Niwas, in Thakurdwar near Girgaon, Mumbai.\n\nHe attended St. Sebastian's Goan High School with his friend Ravi Kapoor, who later took the stage name Jeetendra. Khanna gradually started taking interest in theatre, did many of stage and theatre plays in his school and college days, and won many prizes in inter-college drama competitions.\n\nIn 1962 Khanna played a wounded mute soldier in the play \"Andha Yug\" and impressed with his performance; the chief guest suggested that he get into films soon. Khanna became a rare newcomer who had his own MG sports car, who once struggled to get work in theatre and films in the early 1960s.\n\nKhanna did his first two years of Bachelor of Arts in Nowrosjee Wadia College in Pune from 1959 to 1961. Khanna later studied in K. C. College, Mumbai and Jeetendra studied from Siddharth Jain College. Khanna tutored Jeetendra for his first film audition. Khanna's uncle KK Talwar changed Khanna's first name to Rajesh when he decided to enter films. His friends and his wife called him \"Kaka\" (meaning a baby faced boy in Punjabi).\n\nRajesh Khanna was one of eight finalists from more than 10,000 contestants in the 1965 All India Talent Contest, organised by United Producers and Filmfare, along with FTII students Subhash Ghai and Dheeraj Kumar.\n\nHe made his film debut in the 1966 film \"Aakhri Khat\", directed by Chetan Anand, followed by \"Raaz\", directed by Ravindra Dave, both of which were a part of his predetermined prize for winning the All-India United Producers' Talent Competition. G.P. Sippy and Nasir Hussain were the first to sign Rajesh Khanna after he won the contest. \"Aakhri Khat\" was India's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 40th Oscar Academy Awards in 1967. Khanna in an interview to the newspaper The Hindu said:\n\nThough 'Aakhri Khat' is my first film, I received my first break as a leading actor in Ravindra Dave's, 'Raaz', in 1967. My heroine was Babita, already a popular actress then. Though I had lots of confidence, I was shy in facing the camera initially. In my first three shots, I had to perform with stress on my body language and dialogue delivery. Though I was right with my dialogues, my movements were not up to the mark. Ravindra Dave explained me my scenes and movements very clearly correcting my way of walking.\n\nBeing under contract with United Producers, he got projects such as \"Aurat\", \"Doli\" and \"Ittefaq\". He was then noticed for his performances in films such as \"Baharon Ke Sapne\", \"Aurat\" (1967), \"Doli\", \"Aradhana\" and \"Ittefaq\". In \"Bahraon Ke Sapne\", the response from the public in the first week of run forced the film's ending to be changed from a tragic one to a happier one from the second week. Later, Waheeda Rehman suggested to Asit Sen to take Khanna for the lead role in \"Khamoshi\". Through \"Aradhana\" he rose to \"instant national fame\" and film critics referred to him as the \"First Superstar of India\". Rajesh Khanna was cast in a double role (father and son) opposite Sharmila Tagore and Farida Jalal. It also saw the resurgence of Kishore Kumar, who eventually became the official playback voice of Rajesh Khanna. They worked together until Kishore's death in 1987 and songs of their combination were released until 1991.\n\nIn 1971, he acted in \"Haathi Mere Saathi\", which became that year's highest-grossing film and the biggest grosser ever till then. Khanna is credited with giving Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar their first chance to become screenplay writers by offering them work in \"Haathi Mere Saathi\". Javed Akhthar accepted and said in an interview: \"One day, he went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow Aashirwad. But the film's script was far from being satisfactory. He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit.\" Rajesh bought Rajendra Kumar's bungalow named Dimple in Carter Road Promenade for 31 lakhs in 1970 and renamed it Ashirwaad.\n\nRajesh Khanna had 15 consecutive solo hit films between 1969 and 1971. These were \"Aradhana\", \"Doli\", \"Bandhan\", \"Ittefaq\", \"Do Raaste\", \"Khamoshi\", \"Safar\", \"The Train\", \"Kati Patang\", \"Sachaa Jhutha\", \"Aan Milo Sajna\", \"Mehboob Ki Mehendi\", \"Choti Bahu\", \"Anand\" and \"Haathi Mere Saathi\". He had 17 consecutive hit films as the lead hero from 1969 to 1971 which included 15 solo hero films and 2 non-solo hero films; \"Andaz\" and \"Maryada\".\n\n\"Badnam Farishte\" in 1971 was unsuccessful at the box office. In 1972, Khanna acted in 11 releases including the Telugu film \"Bangaru Babu\". That year, his films, \"Amar Prem\", \"Apna Desh\" and \"Mere Jeevan Saathi\" earned more than Rs.5 crore together. His other films of 1972 such as \"Dil Daulat Duniya\", \"Bawarchi\", \"Joroo Ka Ghulam\" and \"Shehzada\" earned more than Rs.4.5 crores. His next release \"Anuraag\" was a hit. The film \"Maalik\" released in end of 1972 was unsuccessful. He made a guest appearance in a Telugu movie called \"Bangaru Babu\", directed by V.B. Rajendra Prasad in 1973, which was a hit at the box office.\n\nAs per the review of \"Raja Rani\" written in 2014 by \"The Hindu\" newspaper, the film did well at the box office and, taking into consideration the inflation as of 2014, the film would have grossed more than 100 crores. The attire worn by Khanna was a sleeveless shirt and trousers, thick leather belt, shoes without socks and a black cap.\"The Hindu\" review noted \"On a lesser actor, the attire would have fallen flat, but Khanna, as a small time thief, carries it with characteristic élan.\"\n\nRajesh acted alongside Mumtaz in eight films. They were neighbours and got along very well, which translated onto the screen. Mumtaz stated \"I would pull his leg and tease him about his fan following. Whenever Rajesh entered a hotel in Madras, there was a queue of 600 girls waiting to see him at midnight. As a result, even I would get some importance, as people would ask for my autograph as well. He was very generous with his associates, and would party a lot.\"\n\nDuring the peak of his career he would be mobbed during public appearances. Fans kissed his car, which would be covered with lipstick marks, and lined the road, cheering and chanting his name. Female fans sent him letters written in their blood. There used to be a line of cars of his producers and hysterical fans outside his bungalow every day. Actor Mehmood parodied him in \"Bombay to Goa\" where the driver and conductor of the bus were called 'Rajesh' and 'Khanna' respectively. Even today, he remains the favourite of mimicry artists, who copy his trademark style and dialogue delivery.\n\nDuring the filming of \"Amar Prem\" there was a scene that needed to be shot at Howrah Bridge with a boat carrying Khanna and Sharmila under the bridge. The authorities ruled this scene out as they realised that if the public found out that the star would be there, it may create problems on the bridge and that it might collapse due to the number of people trying to get a glimpse of their favourite actor. Film critic Monojit Lahiri remembers \"Girls married themselves to photographs of Rajesh Khanna, cutting their fingers and applying the blood as sindoor. Rajesh was God, there has never been such hysteria.\"\n\nIn the year 1974, the Filmfare Awards were held honouring the films released in the year 1973. Khanna was nominated for his performance in a complicated role in \"Daag\". However, since Rishi Kapoor had paid Rs.30,000 to receive the Best Actor award for his role in \"Bobby\", Khanna did not win the award for his performance in \"Daag\".\nSeveral songs sung by Kishore Kumar in the 1970s were based on Rajesh Khanna. During the filming of the song \"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani\" in Aradhana, Sharmila Tagore was shooting for a Satyajit Ray film and director Shakti Samanta had to shoot their scenes separately and then join the scenes together. In the 1970s, his chemistry with Sharmila Tagore, Mumtaz, Asha Parekh, Zeenat Aman, Tanuja and Hema Malini were also popular with audiences.\n\nIn 1973, BBC also made a documentary on him named as \"Bombay Superstar\" as a part of their \"Man Alive\" series. Shooting began when he got married and his film \"Daag\" premiered. In the video it can be noticed that Khanna was shooting for \"Aap Ki Kasam\". A textbook prescribed by the Mumbai University contained an essay, \"The Charisma of Rajesh Khanna!\"\n\nSharmila Tagore said in an interview to \"The Indian Express\" that \"women came out in droves to see \"Kaka\". They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse, they would marry his photographs, they would pull at his clothes. Delhi girls were crazier for him than Mumbai girls. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen anything like this before or since.\"\n\nMusic remained one of the biggest attractions of all Rajesh Khanna films throughout his career. His films were always known for the music with chartbuster soundtracks. The reason for this was that Khanna used to personally sit in music sessions with music directors such as Kalyanji Anandji, R. D. Burman, Shankar Jaikishen, Lakshmikant Pyarelal, S.D. Burman, Bappie Lahiri and select tunes for duets and solo songs in his films. He used to be personally present for recording of the solo songs to be picturised on him.\n\nMany of the musical scores for Khanna's films were composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Sachin Dev Burman and R. D. Burman. The trio of Rajesh Khanna, Kishore Kumar and R.D. Burman went on to make a number of popular films, including \"Kati Patang, Amar Prem, Shehzada, Apna Desh, Mere Jeevan Saathi, Aap Ki Kasam, Ajnabee, Namak Haraam, Maha Chor, Karm, Phir Wohi Raat, Aanchal, Kudrat, Ashanti, Agar Tum Na Hote, Awaaz, Hum Dono\" and \"Alag Alag\".\n\nKhanna considered Guru Dutt, Meena Kumari and Geeta Bali to be his idols. Khanna said in an interview: \"My inspirations include Dilip Kumar's dedication and intensity, Raj Kapoor's spontaneity, Dev Anand's style and Shammi Kapoor's rhythm.\"\n\nBetween 1976 and 1978, Khanna acted in several films that were not commercially successful. These films included \"Mehbooba\", \"Bundal Baaz\", \"Tyaag\", \"Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein\", \"Naukri\", \"Chakravyuha\" and \"Janta Hawaldar\", which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, Meraj, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and Mehmood Ali, respectively. Khanna persuaded Samanta to cast his sister-in-law Simple Kapadia opposite him in \"Anurodh\". Films starring Rajesh Khanna and directed by Shakti Samanta tended to be commercially successful, but \"Mehbooba\" was an exception. The change from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers caused some decline of Khanna's career in terms of box office ratings. The declaration of emergency in India had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption to become successes. Actor Joy Mukherjee made \"Chhailla Babu\", a suspense thriller in 1977, which became the only successful film of his as a director, and the unexpected success of \"Chhailla Babu\" gave a boost to the career of Khanna. However, Khanna continued basically in solo-hero socially sober household meaningful films during this era and played a variety of characters in films of various genres. During this phase too he had box office hits like \"Maha Chor\", \"Anurodh\", \"Bhola Bhala\", \"Tinku\" and \"Karm\".\n\nKhanna was the first choice of director Raj Kapoor for the lead role in Satyam Shivam Sundaram, however, but since few members from the Raj Kapoor camp vehemently opposed Khanna being the lead, particularly Rishi Kapoor, the role went to Shashi Kapoor.\n\nAfter 1978, Khanna starred in films like such as \"Amar Deep\", \"Phir Wohi Raat\", \"Bandish\", \"Thodisi Bewafaii, Dard, Kudrat, Dhanwan, Ashanti (1982 film), Avtaar, Agar Tum Na Hote, Souten, Jaanwar, Asha Jyoti, Awaaz\", \"Naya Kadam\", \"Hum Dono, Babu, Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar\", \"Shatru\", \"Insaaf Main Karoonga, Anokha Rishta, Nazrana, Angaarey, Adhikar, Amrit, Awam\" and \"Rupaye Dus Karod\". Director Bharathiraja decided to remake his 1978 Tamil box office hit film \"Sigappu Rojakkal\" in Hindi with Khanna playing a psychopath. Kamal Haasan who played the same role in Tamil won South Filmfare Best Actor Award for his portrayal. But the Hindi movie was seen as controversial by traditional and orthodox Hindi moviegoers and was not a commercial success.\n\nTina Munim and Rajesh Khanna became an on and off screen couple of the eighties with movies such as \"Fiffty Fiffty\", \"Souten\", \"Suraag \", \"Aakhir Kyon?\", \"Bewafai\", \"Insaaf Main Karoonga\", \"Alag Alag\" and \"Adhikar\". Ram Awatar Agnihotri wrote that Tina Munim showed the first sparks of the dedicated actress she would become in the films \"Alag Alag\" and \"Adhikar\", both with Khanna. His on-screen pairings with Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil, Padmini Kolhapure and Poonam Dhillon were also popular in the eighties. He also acted in the Marathi hit film \"Sundara Satarkar\" in 1981.\n\nKamal Haasan was a close friend of Khanna. Khanna starred in Hindi remakes of 3 Tamil films originally starring Kamal, and Kamal acted in 2 remakes of Khanna's films. Kamal quoted in an interview, to narrate how he experienced Khanna's stardom in an incident in 1985 – \"He probably hadn't been to a public theatre since he became a star. When we reached, things were okay. He enjoyed the mediocre film (\"The Swarm\") thoroughly and refused to leave until the end titles. That's when I panicked. This was Rajesh Khanna, the star of the millennium. If audiences got to know he was present there would be a stampede and blood on my hands. But Mr Khanna refused to listen. He stayed on till the end. The inevitable happened after the show. All hell broke loose as audiences realised he was there. I became Rajesh Khanna's bodyguard and security officer as I took him through the crowd. His shirt was torn, but he was enjoying himself thoroughly. He giggled and chuckled like a child.\"\n\nKhanna performed in successful multi-star films including \"Rajput, Dharm Aur Qanoon\", \"Paapi Pet Ka Sawaal Hai, Zamana, Dil-E-Nadaan\" and \"Ghar Ka Chiraag\". He did three movies with Jeetendra: \"Dharam Kanta\", \"Nishaan\" and \"Maqsad\". In 1984, \"Maqsad\" was the second-highest ranked film in terms of box office results, earning gross 8.5 crores. In \"Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar\", Khanna played the character of a corrupt politician. Viewers praised his role in the film. In 1985 he produced \"Alag Alag\". According to \"The Guardian\" (UK), he had 11 releases as solo lead hero in the year 1985 and eight of them were hits. In 1985, the film \"Bewafai\", with Khanna as the lead hero and Rajinikanth in a negative role, released and became a success and grossed Rs 11.95 crore at the box office that year. Before joining politics, one of his last films as the lead hero was \"Swarg\", released in 1990. David Dhawan regards \"Swarg\" as his favourite directorial venture. In the year 1991, he starred in films - \"Ghar Parivaar\", \"Rupaye Dus Karod\" and \"Begunaah\" as the lead hero.\n\nHe worked in films of different genres: tragedy in \"Babu\" as a rickshaw puller, thriller in \"Red Rose\" as a psychopath, political adventure in \"Awam\", fantasy in \"Bundalbaaz\" and \"Jaanwar\", crime in \"Phir Wohi Raat\" and \"Angarey\", suspense in \"Chakravyuha\" and \"Ittefaq\", comedy in \"Joru Ka Ghulam\", \"Bawarchi\", \"Hum Dono\" and \"Masterji\", action in \"Ashanti\" and \"Zamana\", and family dramas addressing different issues in \"Aanchal\", \"Amrit\" and \"Agar Tum Na Hote\" and films addressing issues of social concerns; \"Avtaar\", \"Naya Kadam\" and \"Akhir Kyun\". He did films of different themes such as reincarnation in \"Kudrat\", spiritualism in \"Maalik\" and immaturity while falling in love in \"Anokha Rishta\", \"Nazrana\" and \"Dil E Nadan\". He played a variety of characters as the lead hero: a postman in \"Palkon Ki Chaon Mein\", a lawyer who proves that his senior has committed a rape 25 years earlier in \"Kudrat\", a politician in \"Aaj Ka MLA Ram Avtaar\", a young musician forced by fate to marry two women in \"Asha Jyoti\", a professional advocate in \"Awaaz\", a fisherman in \"Prem Bandhan\", a patriot in \"Prem Kahani,\" a righteous farmer in \"Bandhan\" and a Muslim who falls in love with a prostitute's daughter in \"Mehboob Ki Mehendi\".\n\nThe main difference between him and his predecessors, successors, contemporaries was that Khanna's films ran successfully in whole of India and not just Hindi speaking areas and he did films of every genre simultaneously and has more critically acclaimed films to his credit than all other Hindi Actors of every generation.\n\nHe shared close relationships with R. D. Burman and Kishore Kumar. The trio were friends and have worked together in thirty-two films. Kishore Kumar had even credited Rajesh Khanna for his resurgence, so much so that he sang for \"Alag Alag\", the first film produced by Rajesh Khanna without charging anything. In 1985 Pancham found himself being sidelined after failures of a few films, but Rajesh Khanna was among the few who continued to stand by him. Rajesh and Pancham worked together even after the death of Kishore in the films \"Jai Shiv Shankar\", the unreleased film \"Police Ke Peechhe Police\" (both produced by Khanna) and \"Sautela Bhai\". Khanna even helped Leena Gangully and Amit Kumar in completing \"Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein\", the last film directed by Kishore, who died before the completion of the film. R.D. Burman had quoted in an interview – \"I have always reserved the best music tunes for Kaka and I dont feel guilty about it, as he deserves it. Although Amitabh Bachchan was a fine actor, it will be Kaka who would be remembered forever and stay immortal\".\n\nPyarelal of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo quoted in an interview that \"Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 film \"Do Raaste\" to the 1986 film \"Amrit\", we gave hits together both as films and as music scores... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout \"Wah! Wah!\" in appreciation... It was God's blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions \"Roti\" and films like \"Sachaa Jhutha\", \"Chhailla Babu\", \"Chakravyuha\", \"Fiffty Fiffty\", \"Amar Deep\", \"Bandish\", \"Asha Jyoti\" and \"Anurodh\". Incidentally, he had a stake in \"Mehboob Ki Mehndi\" too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta's \"Anurodh\" only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then, and did not want to work with him.\" Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishore was very reluctant to sing \"Waada Tera Waada\" in \"Dushman\" and suggested to Laxmikant-Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishore meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishore that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this, Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.\n\nActors who were part of the cast of most of his films include Ashok Kumar, Sujit Kumar, Prem Chopra, Madan Puri, Asrani, Bindu, Vijay Arora, Roopesh Kumar, Dina Pathak and A. K. Hangal, who remained part of his \"working team\" from the start until the late eighties. The lyricist whom he preferred for his movies was Anand Bakshi. Films by Shakti Samanta with Khanna in the lead, music by Pancham and lyrics by Anand Bakshi had people swooning. The films Samanta directed without Khanna in the eighties were duds. His other close friends from the film industry include Raj Babbar, J. Om Prakash, Prem Chopra and D. Rama Naidu and Jeetendra.\n\nCelebrities of the post-2000 era, like Madhur Bhandarkar, say that they take at least three or four turns in Carter Road at that time, just to see Khanna. The younger generation stars like Imran Khan still regard Rajesh Khanna as someone who would take the top slot as the most romantic hero of all time. Shah Rukh Khan idolises Rajesh Khanna and has opined; \"Rajesh Khanna, you can't touch\". Anupam Kher said \"Kishore Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar, S. D. Burman, R. D. Burman, Rajesh Khanna and Smita Patil changed the face of Indian cinema. They're remembered by the films that they did.\" Actor Tom Alter confessed \"I still dream of being Rajesh Khanna. For me, in the early 1970s, he was the only hero – romantic to the core, not larger than life, so Indian and real – he was my hero; the reason I came into films and he still is.\" Actor Irrfan Khan stated in an interview, \"The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality.\" The trend of wearing guru kurtas and belts on shirts became famous in the seventies and eighties because of Khanna. Javed Akhthar, in an interview, told about his experience with Khanna's stardom: \"Bangalore used to have a state lottery and the government asked him to draw the lucky number. They organised it in a stadium. I was with him as we were discussing some scripts. I don't know if I will experience that again, the sound of 50,000 people gasping (when they saw him). He was like Caesar. It was unbelievable\". Actor Salman Khan has told in many interviews that he or Aamir or Shahrukh have not even achieved 10 percent of kind of achievements Khanna had in field of acting or his stardom.\n\nWhile serving as Congress M.P. from 1991 to 1996, he returned to acting, playing the lead in \"Khudai\" (1994), which was about a father and son both falling in love with the same woman. After 1992, he appeared in only 10 films and declined most film offers. He made a comeback as an NRI in \"Aa Ab Laut Chalen\" (1999), and \"Kyaa Dil Ne Kahaa\" (2002) and played the solo lead in the films \"Sautela Bhai\" in 1996, \"Pyar Zindagi Hai\" in 2001, \"Kaash Mere Hote\" in 2009, \"Wafaa\" in 2008 and \"Riyasaat\" in 2010. He did 4 television serials in the period 2000–2009.\n\nHe appeared in a rare interview in the show \"Aap Ki Adalat\" in 1992, where he quoted to the interviewer Rajat Sharma, \n\"I would just ask if I am arrogant, how come all these producers made so many films with me. My fans who turned this actor into a superstar would have never accepted me if I was arrogant. If I was arrogant people would not have made me a Lok Sabha member because if someone is arrogant, that arrogance is visible. And this public knows everything and understand everything,\"\n\nKhanna was a life member of the International Film And Television Research Centre, the International Film And Television Club and the Asian Academy of Film & Television. He was Faculty Guest of \"Specialised Cinema Courses At Asian School Of Media Studies\". On 10 April 1999 Khanna inaugurated the live concert of S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, held at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad as a tribute to R. D. Burman. In 2001 and 2002, Rajesh played the lead in two television serials: \"Aapne Parai\" (B4U & DD Metro) and \"Ittefaq\" (Zee TV). He performed in a video album based on Tagore's songs (Rabindra Sangeet) without payment. He also endorsed \"Star se Superstar tak\" – a talent hunt programme in 2007 and donated a Gold Trophy of Rs.1 crore. In its Silver Jubilee Episode on 14–15 March 2008, \"K for Kishore\" aired a Rajesh Khanna special. He signed on to star in a TV serial with Creative Eye Banner, (Dhiraj Kumar) in 2007, and in 2008 performed in a TV serial, \"Bhabhima\", with Leena Ganguly as his co-star. His successful TV serial \"Raghukul Reet Sada Chali Aayi\" began in November 2008 and ended in September 2009. Khanna cited the lack of good roles for actors like him in films as the reason for him not appearing much in films after 2001. He said in an interview on being queried about his decision to do TV serials: \"The reach of TV is much more than cinema today and one episode of my serial is likely to be watched by more people than a super-hit film\". In 2009, on his 67th birthday, Shemaroo Entertainment released his films and a song collection titled \"Screen Legends-Rajesh Khanna-the Original Superstar\". In May 2012, Havells, the fan making company endorsed Khanna as Brand Ambassador for their new ad campaign featuring him in solo advertisements.\n\nAt the insistence of Rajiv Gandhi, he started campaigning for Congress after 1984. In the election for New Delhi seat in the 1991 Lok Sabha election, Khanna lost to L.K. Advani by a narrow margin of 1589 votes, after which Khanna stood on the grounds at the counting station insisting that he had been cheated of a win. In 1992, a by-election was called after the resignation of the incumbent Member of Parliament L.K. Advani. Khanna contested the seat again, won the by-election by defeating Shatrughan Sinha by 25,000 votes. Rajesh Khanna was a member of Parliament for the Indian National Congress, from the New Delhi constituency, where he won the 1992 by-election, retaining his seat until 1996 after which he was not interested in active politics. When Khanna was MP, he did not accept new acting assignments, but only acted in the film \"Khudai\" (1994). After leaving parliament, he was a political activist for the INC and campaigned for the party till the 2012 Punjab election.\n\nKhanna and a group of foreign investors bought land in Shirdi in which built a religious resort for disciples of Sai Baba of Shirdi.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Khanna fell in love with the then fashion designer and actress Anju Mahendru. They were in a relationship for seven years. Khanna's sudden stardom and his insistence that Mahendru quit her acting career eventually ended their relationship. Mahendru states that the couple did not speak to each other for 17 years after the break-up. Later Khanna married the budding actress Dimple Kapadia in March 1973, before Kapadia's debut film \"Bobby\" released in November of that year. Khanna and Kapadia have two daughters from the marriage; Twinkle and Rinke. Khanna and Kapadia separated in 1984, but did not complete the divorce proceedings. According to Yasser Usman's biography of Khanna, the couple separated because Kapadia wished to return to acting. She had quit acting when she married Khanna since the latter wanted his partner to be a housewife. A few years after their marriage Kapadia decided to resume her career. However, Khanna remained adamant that his wife will not work. Kapadia eventually left Khanna and started her career in films. In the 1980s, Tina Munim was in love with Rajesh Khanna. Munim had been a fan of Rajesh since her school days. They appeared in ten films together between 1981 and 1986. According to website Bollywood Mantra reporter, Khanna refused to marry her as their marriage would have a bad impact on his daughters. Khanna and Kapadia however maintained an amicable relationship where they both were seen together at parties and family functions. Kapadia also campaigned for Khanna's election and worked in his film \"Jai Shiv Shankar\" (1990), although the film never got released. After Tina Munim's exit, Khanna resumed his friendship with Anju Mahendru.\n\nKhanna's elder daughter Twinkle Khanna, an interior decorator and a former film actress, is married to actor Akshay Kumar, while his younger daughter Rinke Khanna, also a former Hindi film actress, is married to a London-based investment banker Samir Saran. On 17 July 2012, a woman named Anita Advani claimed that she had been Khanna's live-in partner, and sent a legal notice to his family members asking for compensation. The family denied the claims.\n\nHis closest friends from the industry included Raj Kapoor, Mumtaz, Shashi Kapoor, Sanjeev Kumar, Kishore Kumar, R.D. Burman, Anand Bakshi, Sharmila Tagore, D. Rama Naidu, Prem Chopra, Manoj Kumar, Ashok Kumar and Jeetendra. He also maintained cordial relationships with Asha Parekh, Zeenat Aman, Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar, Yash Chopra, Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Rishi Kapoor and Rakesh Roshan. In his later years, he became friendlier with Amitabh Bachchan, who was billed as his main rival in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn June 2012, it was reported that Rajesh Khanna's health had been deteriorating for some time. On 23 June he was admitted to Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai due to health complications. He was discharged on 8 July from the hospital and was reportedly fine.\n\nOn 14 July, Khanna was readmitted to the Lilavati Hospital, but was discharged on 16 July. He died on 18 July 2012, at his bungalow, Aashirwad, in Mumbai. Sources confirmed that his health had been deteriorating since July 2011 as he was diagnosed with cancer. After his death his co-star Mumtaz said that he was suffering from cancer for the duration of the prior year and had undergone chemotherapy sessions. His funeral took place on 19 July at 11:00. His funeral was attended by 9 lakh people and his fans had come from places like Surat, Ahmedabad, and even from foreign countries as well.

He died in the presence of his wife Dimple Kapadia, daughters Rinke Khanna and Twinkle Khanna, son-in-law Akshay Kumar, Grandchildren, Anju Mahendru and other close relatives. His pyre was lit by his grandson, Aarav, with the assistance of Akshay Kumar.\n. On 25 July 2012, his ashes were immersed in the Ganges at Rishikesh, Uttarakhand by his wife Dimple Kapadia and daughter Rinke Khanna.\n\nThe President of India, Pratibha Patil lamented the passing away of the actor. In a press release she said \"I am saddened to learn about the passing away of Rajesh Khanna. In his prime as an actor he was the heartthrob of the young generation of 1970s, who tried to model themselves on him and his style.\" Many celebrities also paid homage to him after his death. His prayer meeting, organised in a grand way at the Taj Land's End hotel in Bandra, Mumbai on 21 July 2012, was attended by many.\n\nShah Rukh Khan reacted by saying: \"To live with intention and walk to the edge. Play with abandon, choose with no regret. Smile and made us do the same. Sir, you defined our era. Whenever life felt tough you made us feel how love could change it all. RIP \" . Mumtaz also added that she had memories of having worked with him and said that she had been crying the whole morning, but was happy that she had met the ailing Rajesh Khanna in Mumbai in June 2012, when the two discussed their respective battles with cancer. While Shahid Kapoor quoted: \"RIP to the First King of Romance ... Rajesh Khanna.\" Subhash Ghai added that Khanna \" was the powerhouse of the Hindi film industry. I met him on the set of Aradhana, he had some kind of energy and you will be charged when he is around you. His name will be written in golden words.\" Amitabh Bachchan was quoted as saying: \"The word 'Superstar' was invented for him, and for me it shall ever remain his, and no others .. !! His generation and the generations that follow, shall never be able to describe, or understand his phenomena .. !!\". His son-in-law Akshay Kumar told reporters about his death and added that \"he has gone to a nice and heavenly place. I am happy that he has gone there and hope that everyone will pray for him.\" Kumar also said on a Facebook post \"To Mr. Rajesh Khanna, they make very few like you, you are a father, a Legend & a very treasured man, who will never be forgotten.\"\n\nVyjayanthimala commented that \"His death is a big loss to the industry. It's my bad luck that I didn't have the chance to work with him because he came much later. I remember when he came to Chennai for some film shoot, the college girls went crazy to catch a glimpse of him when he was going to his studio.\" Manna Dey said: \"He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him. I have worked for him in several movies, and actors like him are a rarity.\" Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. \"We had met several times. Once I had wanted to cast him in one of my films, but somehow that didn't work out due to his date problems.\"\n\nBuddhadeb Dasgupta said Khanna's acting would continue to inspire young actors in the future. \"He was a great actor and was the first superstar. He was a much bigger star than Amitabh Bachchan. His acting will continue to inspire young actors of the coming generations.\" Rituparno Ghosh said: \"In the film 'Anand', he delivered some of Indian cinema's most memorable dialogues. The use of the word 'Babu Moshai' by Rajesh Khanna to Amitabh Bachchan, who played a Bengali doctor in the film, is so deeply etched in the minds of Indians that it has almost become a synonym for Bengalis for the rest of the countrymen. \"In a dhoti and kurta, you showed the rest of India how truly elegant Bengal was\" Madhur Bhandarkar said, \"The epitome of superstardom is no more amongst us. There was none, there is none and there won't be any like you, Kakaji.\"\n\nFilm historian S. M. M. Ausaja added: \"He never acted in a Bengali cinema. But right from the late 1960s to the 70s he was the top star and worked with the top directors of his era, most of whom were Bengalis.\" There were also reactions from the \"Gali Tiwaria\" where his ancestral house was, and had since been converted to a temple through his donation. Songs from his movies were played as the news of his death became known. His foster brother Muni Chand Khanna said that \"he used to love to play Cricket when he lived here. He was a simple boy when he lived here and led a simple life even after achieving so much.\" As were the residents of Burewala, Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, those within the political spectrum that offered their condolences included Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who said that he \"convey[s] my heartfelt condolences to the members of the bereaved family and countless fans and admirers of Shri Rajesh Khanna.\" INC President Sonia Gandhi also expressed her sorrow. Regional political leaders who offered their condolences included Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee, who said: \"Rajesh Khanna was always a symbol of romance. His smiling face and the ability to connect with people at ease had made him popular. We lost a big pole star in the film world today.\" As well as Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who added that \"his death has caused irreparable loss to Hindi cinema.\"\n\nCondolences also came from Pakistan where Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf called Khanna a \"great actor whose contribution to the field of films and arts would be long remembered. [He had a] large fan following across the borders and captivated audiences with his excellent acting skills.\" Ali Zafar wrote on \"Twitter\": \"Rajesh Khanna – RIP. So many fond memories from his movies and songs.\", while Syed Noor said: \"Rajesh Khanna was such a huge actor of the subcontinent that he will be remembered by the people for many years to come. The era he reigned over is unlikely to be experienced by any other actor of this subcontinent.\" \"Geo TV\" also aired a nearly hour-long tribute with contributions from actors, filmmakers and musicians.\nA postage stamp featuring Khanna was released by the India Post on 3 May 2013. On his first death anniversary, a bronze statue of Rajesh Khanna was unveiled at Bandra Bandstand, Mumbai. A chowk (intersection) in Girgaon has been named \"Superstar Rajesh Khanna Chowk\" in his memory. A Park at Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi has been renamed as Superstar Rajesh Khanna Park in his memory.\n\nKhanna won seven All-India Critics Association (AICA) Best Actor Awards, and received 10 nominations. He won four Best Actor Awards in the Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, and received 25 nominations.

He was a top-ten doubles player and a runner-up at the 1999 French Open men's doubles tournament. He is now the Director of Tennis at the Jack Kramer Club, which is just south of Los Angeles. In 2018, he was the tournament director of a $30,000 men's California championships. Andras Cruz-Aedo was his and UTR Powered by Oracle's digital marketing consultant and assistant for this event. At that championships, ATP world-ranked No. 11, Sam Querrey, beat Davis Cup captain Mardy Fish to win this event.\n\nTarango now resides in Manhattan Beach, California with his wife and children. He is married to Jessica Balgrosky and they have five children (Nina Rose, Katherine, Jackson, Ace, and Jesse).\n\nTarango turned professional in 1989, after completing his junior year at Stanford University, where he won two NCAA team titles. During his career, he won two top-level singles titles and 14 doubles titles. Tarango reached two Super 9 quarterfinals, Rome in 1995 and Miami in 1998. His career-high world rankings are No. 42 in singles and No. 10 in doubles. He was runner-up in the men's doubles at the 1999 French Open, partnering with Goran Ivanišević.\n\nIn the third round trailing 6–7, 1–3 to Alexander Mronz, Tarango became infuriated with French umpire Bruno Rebeuh, who had ruled against Tarango several times. During the match, when preparing to serve, the crowd heckled Tarango and he responded \"Oh, shut up!\" Rebeuh immediately issued a code violation to Tarango on the grounds of audible obscenity. Tarango protested this and called for the tournament referee calling for Rebeuh to be removed. No relief was given to Tarango and he was instructed to continue to play. He then accused Rebeuh of being \"one of the most corrupt officials in the game\" – to this Rebeuh gave Tarango another code violation, this time for unsportsmanlike conduct. Tarango took umbrage, packed up his rackets and stormed off the court. To add to the controversy, Tarango's wife at the time then slapped Rebeuh twice in the face.\n\nTarango was eventually banned by the ITF from the 1996 Wimbledon tournament.\n\nTarango was also the beneficiary of a default in the men's doubles tournament earlier at the same championship. He and partner Henrik Holm were at two sets to one down against the team of Jeremy Bates and Tim Henman when Henman angrily smashed a ball which inadvertently hit ball girl Caroline Hall, resulting in their disqualification. Coincidentally, Hall was also a ball girl in Tarango's match against Mronz.\n\nTarango retired from the main tour in 2003 and now devotes his time to coaching, broadcasting for BBC, ESPN, Tennis Channel, Fox Sports and DirecTV.

Jackson served as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Peterborough from 2005 to 2017. After being ousted by Labour's Fiona Onasanya at the 2017 general election, he served as Chief of Staff, and Special Adviser to David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, until July 2018 when Davis resigned his position.\n\nJackson was born in Woolwich and brought up in south-east London. He was educated at the London Nautical School in Lambeth, and Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate, Kent, followed by Royal Holloway, University of London, where he was awarded a BA (Hons) degree in Economics & Public Administration, in 1988. Jackson was elected President of the University of London Union for the 1988–89 academic year. During his tenure as president, he faced a no-confidence motion in January 1989, and resigned before he was required to leave office.\n\nJackson served on Ealing Borough Council in west London from 1990 to 1998, during which time he was Conservative Party spokesman on planning and housing. He is Vice-President of the Local Government Association.\n\nJackson unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary constituency of Brent South at the 1997 general election. He was then selected as the Conservative candidate for the Peterborough seat in October 2000, and fought the 2001 general election, where he reduced the Labour Party's majority in the constituency from 7,323 votes to 2,854 votes, but lost to the incumbent Labour MP Helen Brinton. Jackson was re-adopted as the Conservative candidate for Peterborough in August 2002, and defeated Brinton at the 2005 general election to become the MP.\n\nIn the 2010 general election, held on 6 May, Jackson increased his majority to 4,861 votes over the Labour candidate, Ed Murphy; he was appointed the following month as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Owen Paterson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, but resigned as PPS on 24 October 2011, after voting against a three-line whip on an EU referendum.\n\nAfter Theresa May's selection as the new Conservative Prime Minister, following David Cameron's resignation, Stewart Jackson was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, in July 2016.\n\nFollowing the loss of his seat at the 2017 general election, Jackson was appointed Special Advisor and Chief of Staff to the Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union.\n\nTogether with other MPs on the Conservative right wing, such as Nadine Dorries, Jackson assisted in establishing the Conservative Voice parliamentary grouping led by David Davis (David Cameron's principal opponent in the contest to win the leadership of the Conservative Party) and Liam Fox (former Secretary of State for Defence). In explaining his decision to join the new right-wing grouping, Jackson said that he hoped it could \"get Cameron back on election-winning ground\" and away from the \"current social liberal mush\". He stated that he would vote against the government's legislation to introduce same-sex marriage, and accused his party leader of being \"arrogant\" for pressing ahead with it.\n\nIn 2014, Jackson, along with six other Conservative Party MPs, voted against the Equal Pay (Transparency) Bill, which would have required all companies with more than 250 employees to declare the gap in pay between the average male and average female salaries.\n\nJackson opposed the 2013 bill to allow gay marriage. In March 2015, he told a constituent: \"The feeling's fully mutual. Please feel free to never bother me again\" after she requested to be removed from his campaign mailing list because she disagreed with his position on the act.\n\nIn March 2015, Jackson attracted media attention for his response to a constituent which was subsequently circulated on social media. Jackson's email told the constituent “The feeling’s fully mutual. Please feel free to never bother me again” after she requested to be removed from his campaign mailing list because she disagreed with his opposition to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013.\n\nOn 26 June 2016, Rupert Myers, a political correspondent for \"The Times\", tweeted about the outcome of the Referendum of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union \"I can't get over the fact that the winning side lied about a whole bunch of stuff & yet expect us to live cheerfully with the result\". Stewart Jackson replied from his verified Twitter account \"Suck it up whiner...\".\n\nJackson attracted attention in October 2016, when he used Twitter to state that patriots should not subscribe to \"The Economist\", a liberal, free-market magazine, because of its arguments about the problems leaving the EU would entail.\n\nAfter losing his seat in 2017, Jackson contacted a former constituent who had been critical of him on Facebook to call him a \"thick chav\", and also wrote: \"If you print any shit about me on Facebook in the future you will regret it.\"\n\nIn October 2018, Jackson, who is known for his pro-Brexit views, was again criticised after tweeting: \"What a pathetic cretin\" in response to a picture of an ill child with a duvet depicting the European Union flag. The child was recovering from an operation at the Great Ormond Street Hospital. Jackson subsequently said, after deleting the initial tweet, that he was referring to the child's stepfather rather than the child himself. The Science Minister, Sam Gyimah, criticised the tweet, saying: \"No one can take credibly or seriously people who use that language.\" Heidi Allen, another Conservative MP, responded by describing Jackson as \"a pathetic, unkind and nasty man.\"\n\nArticles in the \"Daily Telegraph\" reported that Jackson had claimed more than £66,000 in three financial years for housing costs in his constituency: on 11 May 2009 the newspaper reported that he had claimed £11,000 in professional, legal and mortgage fees on buying a new constituency home. However, Jackson argued that there were legitimate 'one-off costs' relating to the purchasing of a home base in the constituency after his election as an MP, and claimed that until the house was purchased, he, his wife and infant daughter were renting one bedroomed accommodation in the constituency.\n\nOn 12 May 2009, both BBC \"Newsnight\", and a second article published by \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that Jackson had claimed £55,000 on housing costs for the constituency house, bringing the total sum to over £66,000. When asked about how MPs should be housed in their constituencies, Jackson was quoted in \"The Daily Telegraph\" as saying that any ban on the second home allowance would be \"draconian and unfair\".\n\nIn May 2013, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) issued a High Court action in an attempt to recover £54,000 in alleged notional Capital Gains arising from Jackson's Peterborough home. The case was settled when a Tomlin Order was sealed in the High Court in February 2014, permanently staying the civil proceedings which had allegedly cost IPSA over £20,000 in legal fees.\n\nIP addresses from inside the Houses of Parliament have often edited the Wikipedia biographies of politicians including Jackson in an attempt to remove details on the parliamentary expenses scandal, and attempts have been made to remove details of Jackson's interaction with a lesbian constituent. Ben Riley-Smith, a correspondent for \"The Daily Telegraph\", argues that it is impossible to prove that changes are made by staff of any particular MP.\n\nIn July 2012, Jackson attempted to tackle a vandal in Peterborough. Jackson, who was shopping with his wife and daughter, tried to perform a citizen's arrest after seeing a bus shelter being vandalised. The vandal got away, but only after kicking the MP. Cambridgeshire Constabulary subsequently arrested a twenty-year-old man in connection with the incident who was later found guilty of assault and criminal damage at Peterborough Magistrates Court.\n\n"}

He was also a candidate in 2013 presidential election and received 3,884,412 votes. He ranked fourth behind winner Hassan Rouhani, runner-up Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Saeed Jalili.\n\nRezaei was born in Masjed Soleyman on 9 September 1954 to a religious Bakhtiyari nomadic family. He spent his childhood and adolescence in the oil-rich city of Masjed Soleyman (Irsoleymān) in southwestern Iran. \n\nAlong with his close friends, he established the \"Religion and Science Association\". When he was to begin studying at a school run by National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in 1969, Rezaei moved to the city of Ahvaz. \n\nAt high school, he started his political and cultural struggle against the Shah's regime. In the last year of high school, he was arrested by the Shah Security service SAVAK in Ahvaz, and interrogated. He was 17 when he served five months in solitary confinement. He did not stop his political activities after he was released from prison. \n\nRezaei arrived in Tehran in 1974 to study mechanical engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology. He studied and worked at the same time. SAVAK intensified its crackdown on guerrilla groups to which he was a member. He had to abandon the university. \n\nHe launched provincial branches of Mansouroun guerrilla fighters in seven provinces. When Ruhollah Khomeini returned home from exile, the Mansouroun group was tasked with protecting the revolutionary leader. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, seven armed Muslim groups teamed up and established the Islamic Revolution Mujahideen Organization to safeguard the nascent Islamic Revolution.\n\nAlthough he studied mechanical engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Rezaee switched to economics after the Iran–Iraq War, studying at Tehran University and received his PhD in 2001.\n\nRezaei joined the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and later was appointed chief of its intelligence division. He was appointed as the IRGC commander by Ruhollah Khomeini, and after it grew in organizational complexity he assumed the office of IRGC's commander-in-chief on 11 September 1981, when he was 27 years old, and remained in the post until he announced his retirement from all of his military posts. He actively participated in the Iran–Iraq War. In 1986, he was named member of the Supreme Defense Council. \n\nRezaee was removed from the IRGC in 1997 due to pressures from the followers of the then president Mohammad Khatami. Another reason for his dismissal was his failure to respond to the perceived threat of attack from the US. He was replaced by Yahya Rahim Safavi.\n\nHe became a member of Expediency Discernment Council and then, its secretary in August 1997. He was also appointed chair of the commission for macroeconomics and commerce. In addition, he is a reviewer of Iran's 2025 versions development.\n\nRezaei founded the news website Tabnak, originally Baztab, in 2002 as a reaction to proliferation of reformist websites. He is also related to Wikirezaee. He also co-founded Imam Hossein University and teaches there.\n\nIt is reported that he returned to IRGC in 2015.\n\nRezaei was a candidate of the presidential election of 2005, but withdrew on 15 June 2005, only two days before the election. Rezaei mentioned he was withdrawing from the race for \"the integration of the votes of the nation\" and \"their effectiveness\". He did not endorse any candidate.\n\nOn 23 April 2009, he announced that he entered the 2009 presidential race, after trying to find another conservative to run against President Ahmadinejad which he lost. He was also a candidate in the 2013 election. Rezaei announced his run for presidency in October 2012.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, Rezaei announced that he \"has no decision to run for president\" in 2017 election. However, in February 2017 he told press that if asked by the Popular Front of Islamic Revolutionary Forces to stand, he \"will think about it\".\n\nIn 1988, Rezaei sent a letter to Ayatollah Khomeini in which he argued that the Iran–Iraq War could not be won.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2009 Iranian elections, Rezaei criticized opposing candidate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's public comments questioning the Holocaust as \"not useful\" for Iran's international standing. Rezaei stated on 2 August 2009 that the ongoing trials of so-called 'prisoners' was an unjust act, issuing a letter on behalf of the Expediency Council of which he is the secretary, condemning the government.\n\nIn September 2019, Rezaei expressed his hope that Iran would capture US President Donald Trump and place him on trial.\n\nA clash and the disagreement over strategy to be adopted in the Iran-Iraq war emerged between Ali Sayed Shirazi, commander of land forces, and Rezaei in July 1986. When this rivalry became public, Ayatollah Khomeini met them in his residence on 19 July 1986 and urged them to \"seek unity\", telling them \"You must endeavor, not to think in terms of being members of the Armed Forces or those of the Guards Corps or of the Basij forces. ... We must understand that if there were to be any disputes among you ... not only are we doomed here and now, but we also are guilty before God.\"\n\nIn November 2006, Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corra issued international arrest warrants for Rezaei, six other Iranians, and one Lebanese in connection with the AMIA bombing, the attacks on 18 July 1994, a suicide bombing of the Jewish cultural center (AMIA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which resulted in the deaths of 85 people and serious injuries to 151. The attack on the Jewish cultural center came two years after the 1992 terrorist bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. In 1998, Rezaei's son, Ahmad, defected to the United States, where he told officials that the attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was planned in Tehran. The son told U.S. authorities that he had accompanied his father to Lebanon to witness the training. Ahmad Rezaei returned to Iran after a short time and declared that his statements about his father's involvement in the bombing were baseless. Mohsen Rezaei has been on the official Wanted list of Interpol since March 2007, for allegations of \"Aggravated Murder and Damages\" related to the 1994 AMIA bombing case. Rezaei rejected the allegations, saying in June 2009 \"These charges were a sheer lie\".\n\nRezaei married in 1974. He has five children, two sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Ahmad, migrated to the United States in 1998 and sought political asylum.\n\nAhmad spoke against the policies of the Iranian Islamic government, and accused his father and others of supporting terrorist acts. He returned to Iran in 2005, recanting his statements, then migrated to the United Arab Emirates in 2011. On 13 November 2011, his body was found in a hotel in Dubai. It was reported that he was killed by a hotel servant, but the Dubai Police stated that he had died after taking a large quantity of antidepressants. His brother, Omidvar, is a member of the Parliament of Iran since 2008.\n\n\nIran Human Rights Documentation Center. \"Violent Aftermath: The 2009 Election and Suppression of Dissent in Iran\".

In the sport of rowing, the rowlocks are attached to outriggers (often just called \"riggers\"), which project from the boat and provide greater leverage. In sport rowing, the rowlocks are normally U-shaped and attached to a vertical pin which allows the rowlock to pivot around the pin during the rowing stroke. They additionally have a locking mechanism (properly known as \"the gate\") across the top of the \"U\" to prevent the oar from unintentionally popping out of the rowlock.\n\nOriginally, rowlocks were two wooden posts or thole pins that the shaft of the oar nestled between. Single thole pins may be used when the oars have holes cut into the loom, which then sits over/around the thole pin.\n\nIn sport rowing oarlocks were originally brass or bronze and open (no gate). With the advent of modern materials oarlocks are now injection moulded plastic and precision made to minimize play (slop) between the oar collar and the oarlock. The most recent sport racing oarlocks have a spring loaded feature to keeps the oar collar firmly against the pin at all times.\n\nOarlocks are technical pieces of equipment in sport rowing, holding the oar shaft and therefore the oar blade at the correct angle in the water to ensure optimum performance.\n\nThe Norwegian municipalities of Fosnes, Radøy and Tjøme have rowlocks in their coats-of-arms.\n"}

In the 1990s, he debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he managed wrestlers such as Sid Justice, Kamala, Giant Gonzalez and Bertha Faye. In 2000, he became the first and only man to win the WWF Women's Championship. Wippleman works backstage in WWE (formerly the WWF) and occasionally manages in the Memphis area as Downtown Bruno.\n\nIn 1979, Lauer attended an independent wrestling show at a circus in Pennsylvania. In exchange for helping to tear down the ring after the show, he was given free admission. He later joined the company and toured Ohio. During this time, The Royal Kangaroos' Jonathan Boyd became his mentor. Back in Pennsylvania, Geeto Mongol trained Lauer and gave him the ring name Dr. Lennerd Spazzinsky.\n\nHe then moved to Memphis, where he performed under the name Downtown Bruno. In 1986, he became the most prominent villainous manager in Memphis. In addition, wrestlers like Jerry Lawler and Sid Eudy helped his career. He continued to work in the Southern promotions for the rest of the late 1980s. In September 1989, he won the Continental Wrestling Federation's Southeastern United States Junior Heavyweight Championship and held it until the promotion closed in November. It was in Continental in 1987 that he first teamed with Eudy, while Eudy was under a mask as an incarnation of Lord Humongous.\n\nIn 1991, Sid Eudy helped bring Lauer to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He debuted as Harvey Wippleman, a Pee-Wee Herman-like character wearing a pin-striped suit with slacks cut at his shins, a red bow-tie, and a flat cap. He first managed Big Bully Busick. When Busick left the company and Slick turned face, Wippleman took over managing The Warlord. However, Wippleman's greatest acquisition was his real-life friend, Sid Justice. When Sid turned heel, working on a program with Hulk Hogan leading to Wrestlemania, Wippleman became Sid Justice's manager and became \"Dr. Harvey Wippleman\". Wippleman would begin carrying a doctor's bag to the ring containing medical equipment. After Sid's matches against jobbers, Wippleman would retrieve a stethoscope from his bag and listen to the defeated wrestler's hearts.\n\nAfter Sid left the company, Wippleman managed Kamala, who was feuding with The Undertaker. After Kamala was defeated by Undertaker in a Coffin match at Survivor Series in 1992, Kamala left Wippleman and Reverend Slick became his new manager. Afterwards, Wippleman dropped the Dr. gimmick. He continued to feud with the Undertaker and brought a new wrestler to the WWF, the nearly eight-foot-tall Giant González. The feud culminated in a Rest in Peace match at SummerSlam, which Undertaker won. During this period, Wippleman also briefly managed Mr. Hughes, who left the WWF after a few months. Wippleman was also the manager of Adam Bomb from October 1993 until June 1994, when Bomb turned face, and feuded with Kwang, who was also being managed by Wippleman. Wippleman also managed Well Dunn, who faced the Rock 'n' Roll Express in the RnR's WWF debut on October 10, 1993.\n\nSince debuting in the WWF, Wippleman was always at odds with ring announcer Howard Finkel, whom Wippleman believed introduced him in a condescending manner. At WrestleMania X, Wippleman tore up Finkel's tuxedo, and Finkel shoved him to the mat. The feud culminated in a tuxedo match on the January 9, 1995 edition of \"Monday Night RAW\", which Finkel won.\n\nWippleman's next high-profile storyline was later in 1995, when he managed his on-screen girlfriend Bertha Faye. Faye, with Wippleman in her corner, won the WWF Women's Championship by defeating Alundra Blayze at SummerSlam 1995. After losing the WWF Women's Championship in late 1995, Faye was dropped from the WWF roster and Wippleman disappeared from television. According to Lauer, he and Bertha didn't get along.\n\nBy spring 1996, Wippleman began making appearances on \"WWF Superstars\", critiquing the referees during the matches in preparation to make a full report to WWF President Gorilla Monsoon about the apparent lack of consistency amongst the officials. Monsoon rewarded Wippleman for his efforts by making him an official referee. One of Wippleman's last appearances as a regular WWF referee during this time came on the March 10, 1997 episode of \"Raw\" when Chyna gorilla pressed him into a group of referees.\nOn the May 19, 1997 episode of \"Raw\" Wippleman appeared in a backstage segment with Stone Cold Steve Austin telling Wippleman that he was going to be his tag team partner with Wippleman responding that he was scared. Wippleman also appeared as \"Handsome Harvey,\" introducing D-Generation-X on \"Raw\" on November 24, 1997. This was to make fun of Rick Rude. Rude had been a member of DX and had just left the company a week earlier to go to WCW. This resulted in Rude being on both \"Raw\" and \"WCW Monday Nitro\" on the same night. (At the time, \"Raw\" was taped every other week while \"Nitro\" was live every week).\n\nIn June 1999, after another period of absence from television broadcasts, Wippleman resurfaced on the June 13 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\" as a referee in a match between then-Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett and Test. Test won the match after outside interference, thus being named the new champion, but he was persuaded by Jarrett's valet Debra to overturn the result and return the belt. He also served as a scab official during the WWF referee strike in September 1999, including at the Unforgiven PPV, again refereeing a match with Jarrett defending the Intercontinental title against Chyna.\n\nOn January 31, 2000, Wippleman won the WWF Women's Championship from The Kat while he was in a disguise and used the name \"Hervina\" in a \"Lumberjill Snow Bunny\" match, which took place in a snow-filled pool surrounded by female wrestlers who kept the competitors from leaving the pool. The win made him the first male to hold the Women's Championship. He lost the title the following day (but broadcast on February 3) to Jacqueline in a match that lasted under a minute, thus ending the shortest reign in the title's history. Through the remainder of 2000, Wippleman appeared in backstage and non-match segments of the WWF's television programming, including a segment on the April 23, 2000 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\" where he appeared dressed up as a rabbit as part of a segment with Al Snow and Steve Blackman.\n\nAt WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, 2001, Wippleman managed Kamala during the gimmick battle royal.\n\nAt the point the Invasion storyline began in 2001, he had disappeared from WWF programming, and was then working as a road agent for the company.\n\nOn November 15, 2010, for WWE's old school episode of \"Raw\", Wippleman returned to WWE, managing the Brooklyn Brawler in a squash loss to Ezekiel Jackson.\n\nAs of 2011, Lauer was working with the WWE in backstage roles at television and pay-per-view events. In an interview with Jim Korderas, Lauer described his role as \"concierge\", taking care of details such as food, rental cars and the like.\n\nOn January 22, 2018, Harvey made a brief backstage appearance during Raw 25 Years.\n\nLauer grew up, in walls, Mississippi,near Memphis According to Lauer, he spent his teenage years \"sprawling on car hoods, smoking cigarettes, and drinking beer with no particular ambition in mind\". His drinking eventually caused Lauer to serve jail time in Memphis.\n\nIn 1994, Lauer was in a car accident with Joey Marella, which claimed Marella's life and injured Lauer. The crash occurred as a result of Marella falling asleep at the wheel while driving on the way to Newark. Marella was not wearing his seat belt, but Lauer–the passenger–was wearing his. Because of the severity of his injuries, however, Lauer incurred approximately $10,000 in medical expenses. He wrote an autobiography \"Wrestling with the Truth\", which was released in 2008. Lauer is Roman Catholic.\n\nContinental Wrestling Federation\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation\n"}

{"id": "1862827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862827", "title": "Chief mate", "text": "Chief mate\n\nA chief mate (C/M) or chief officer, usually also synonymous with the first mate or first officer, is a licensed mariner and head of the deck department of a merchant ship. The chief mate is customarily a watchstander and is in charge of the ship's cargo and deck crew. The actual title used will vary by ship's employment, by type of ship, by nationality, and by trade: for instance, \"chief mate\" is not usually used in the Commonwealth, although \"chief officer\" and \"first mate\" are; on passenger ships, the first officer may be a separate position from that of the chief officer that is junior to the latter.\n\nThe chief mate answers to the captain for the safety and security of the ship. Responsibilities include the crew's welfare and training in areas such as safety, firefighting, search and rescue.\n\nThe Chief Mate, who is the second in command of the vessel, is often equated, in corporate terms, to a senior manager for the operations on board, as the Mate is in charge of a number of departmental functions. In modern cargo vessels, the Mate holds appointments like Head of Deck Department, Head of Cargo/ Stowage Operations, Head of Safety/ Fire Fighting, Head of On-Board Security (Ship Security Officer), Head of Environment and Quality, and so forth.\n\nAs cargo officer, a chief mate oversees the loading, stowage, securing and unloading of cargoes. Moreover, the chief mate is accountable for the care of cargo during the voyage. This includes a general responsibility for the ship's stability and special care for cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful.\n\nEven under the best of conditions, a ship is balanced precariously upon the water and is subject to a number of forces, such as wind, swells, and storms, which could capsize it. The cargo officer uses tools like ballasting and load balancing to optimize the ship's performance for the expected type of environment.\n\nTraditionally, the chief mate stands a \"4-8\" watch: from 4 AM until 8 AM and 4 PM until 8 PM., in port and at sea, the chief mate is responsible to the captain for keeping the ship, crew, and cargo safe. On watch, the mate must enforce all applicable regulations, such as the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and pollution regulations. In port, the watch focuses on duties such as cargo operations, fire and security watches, monitoring communications and the anchor or mooring lines.\n\nIMO regulations require the officer be fluent in English. This is required for a number of reasons, such as ability to use nautical charts and nautical publications, to understand weather and safety messages, communicate with other ships and coast stations, and to be able to work with a multi-lingual crew.\n\nAt sea, the mate on watch has three fundamental duties: navigate the ship, safely avoid traffic, and respond to any emergencies that may arise. Mates generally stand watch with able seamen who act as helmsman and lookout. The helmsman executes turns and the lookout reports dangers such as approaching ships. These roles are often combined to a single helmsman/lookout and, under some circumstances, are eliminated completely. The ability to smartly handle a ship is key to safe watchstanding. A ship's draught, trim, speed and under-keel clearance all affect its turning radius and stopping distance. Other factors include the effects of wind and current, squat, shallow water and similar effects. Shiphandling is key when the need arises to rescue a man overboard, to anchor, or to moor the ship.\n\nThe officer must also be able to transmit and receive signals by Morse light and to use the International Code of Signals.\n\nCelestial, terrestrial, electronic, and coastal navigation techniques are used to fix a ship's position on a navigational chart. The officer directs the helmsman to keep to track, accounting for effects of winds, tides, currents and estimated speed. The officer uses supplemental information from nautical publications, such as Sailing Directions, tide tables, Notices to Mariners, and radio navigational warnings to keep the ship clear of danger in transit.\n\nSafety demands the mate be able to quickly solve steering control problems and to calibrate the system for optimum performance. Since magnetic and gyrocompasses show the course to steer, the officer must be able to determine and correct for compass errors.\n\nWeather's profound effect on ships requires the officer be able to interpret and apply meteorological information from all available sources. This requires expertise in weather systems, reporting procedures and recording systems.\n\nThe International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea are a cornerstone of safe watchkeeping. Safety requires that one live these rules and follows the principles of safe watchkeeping. Maximizing bridge teamwork, including the practice of Bridge Resource Management, is an emerging focus in watchkeeping.\n\nThe main purpose for Radar and Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) on a ship's bridge is to move safely among other vessels. These instruments help to accurately judge information about prominent objects in the vicinity, such as:\n\n\nThese factors help the officer apply the COLREGS to safely maneuver in the vicinity of obstructions and other ships.\n\nUnfortunately, radar has a number of limitations, and ARPA inherits those limitations and adds a number of its own. Factors such as rain, high seas, and dense clouds can prevent radar from detecting other vessels. Further, dense traffic and course and speed changes can confuse ARPA units. Finally, human errors such as inaccurate speed inputs and confusion between true and relative vectors add to the limitations of the radar/ARPA suite.\n\nUnder the best conditions, the radar operator must be able to optimize system settings and detect divergences between an ARPA system and actual conditions. Information obtained from radar and ARPA must be treated with scrutiny: over reliance on these systems has sunk ships. The officer must understand system performance, limitations and accuracy, tracking capabilities and limitations, and processing delays, and the use of operational warnings and system tests.\n\nEmergencies can happen at any time. The officer must be equipped to safeguard passengers and crew. The officer must be able to take initial action after a collision or a grounding. Responsibilities include performing damage assessment and control, understanding the procedures for rescuing persons from the sea, assisting ships in distress, and responding to any emergency which may arise in port.\n\nThe Chief Mate is in charge of the firefighting and damage control teams. He is scene leader and reports via radio to the Captain who is in command and coordinates the larger response from the bridge.\n\nThe officer must understand distress signals and know the IMO Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual.\n\nUnderstanding ship's stability, trim, stress, and the basics of ship's construction is a key to keeping a ship seaworthy. The mate must know what to do in cases of flooding and loss of buoyancy. Fire is also a constant concern. Knowing the classes and chemistry of fire, fire-fighting appliances, and systems prepares the officer to act fast in case of fire.\n\nAn officer must be expert in the use of survival craft and rescue boats. Expertise includes the vessels' launching appliances and arrangements, and their equipment including radio life-saving appliances, satellite EPIRBs, SARTs, immersion suits and thermal protective aids. It's important to be expert in the techniques for survival at sea techniques in case it's necessary to abandon ship.\n\nOfficers are trained to perform medical tasks, and follow instructions given by radio or obtained from guides. This training includes what to do in case of common shipboard accidents and illnesses.\n\nIt is usual for a chief/first officer to hold a master's certificate so that he can take over from the master if necessary. In the same way, a second officer usually holds a chief officer's certificate.\n\nTo become a chief mate (unlimited) in the United States, one must first accumulate at least 365 days of service while holding a second mate's license. Then, the candidate must attend approximately 13 weeks of classes or complete the assessments from NMC Policy Letter 04-02 and pass a series of examinations given by the United States Coast Guard. Similarly, one must have worked as a third mate for 365 days to have become a second mate. There are many special cases in license upgrades at the individual level, as licensing regulations change from time to time. A sizable portion of mates still working received their licenses before current laws went into effect.\n\nThere are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate \"sea time\" and take a series of training classes and examinations.\n\nTraining institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (deck curriculum), the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and U.S. Naval Academy with qualification as an underway officer in charge of a navigational watch, any of the state maritime colleges, the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, or a three-year apprentice mate training program approved by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nA seaman may start the process of attaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as able seaman, boatswain, or quartermaster. Then the seaman takes required training courses, and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a Third Mate's license.\n\nA master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license.\n\nIf approved the applicant must then successfully pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license. \"Hawsepiper\" is an informal maritime industry term used to refer to an officer who began his or her career as an unlicensed merchant seaman and did not attend a traditional maritime college/academy to earn the officer license.\n\nA ship's hawsepipe is the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through. Hawsepiper refers to climbing up the hawsepipe, a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. Hawsepiper is considered a positive term when said respectfully. Many hawsepipers are proud of their background and use the term to describe themselves.\n\nSeveral merchant seamen's unions offer their membership the required training to for career advancement. Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training.\n\nSince the requirements of STCW '95 have been enacted, there have been complaints that the hawsepiper progression path has been made too difficult because of the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. These critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals held that both practices violated the Constitution.\n\nDoes paying a chaplain for religious services using taxpayer dollars violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\n\nIn a 6–3 decision in favor of Marsh, Chief Justice Burger wrote the opinion for the majority. The Chief Justice noted that the position of chaplain has been closely tied to the work of state and federal legislatures. \"This unique history leads us to accept the interpretation of the First Amendment draftsmen who saw no real threat to the Establishment Clause arising from a practice of prayer similar to that now challenged.\"\n\nJustice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, wrote in a dissenting opinion,\n\nThe Court makes no pretense of subjecting Nebraska's practice of legislative prayer to any of the formal \"tests\" that have traditionally structured our inquiry under the Establishment Clause. That it fails to do so is, in a sense, a good thing, for it simply confirms that the Court is carving out an exception to the Establishment Clause, rather than reshaping Establishment Clause doctrine to accommodate legislative prayer. For my purposes, however, I must begin by demonstrating what should be obvious: that, if the Court were to judge legislative prayer through the unsentimental eye of our settled doctrine, it would have to strike it down as a clear violation of the Establishment Clause.\n\nCiting \"Lemon v. Kurtzman\" (1971), Justice Brennan points out that the circumstances in the present case clearly do not meet the three-point \"Lemon\" test:\n\nEvery analysis in this area must begin with consideration of the cumulative criteria developed by the Court over many years. Three such tests may be gleaned from our cases. First, the statute [at issue] must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster \"an excessive government entanglement with religion.\"\n\nJustice Stevens also wrote a dissenting opinion, where he essentially argues that religious minorities of any particular region will be disenfranchised by the majority ruling, stating:\n\nPrayers may be said by a Catholic priest in the Massachusetts Legislature and by a Presbyterian minister in the Nebraska Legislature, but I would not expect to find a Jehovah's Witness or a disciple of Mary Baker Eddy or the Reverend Moon serving as the official chaplain in any state legislature. Regardless of the motivation of the majority that exercises the power to appoint the chaplain, it seems plain to me that the designation of a member of one religious faith to serve as the sole official chaplain of a state legislature for a period of 16 years constitutes the preference of one faith over another in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\"\n\nIn \"Town of Greece v. Galloway\" (2014) the Court held that the Establishment Clause is not violated when a town board begins their sessions with a sectarian prayer, so long as the town does not discriminate against minority faiths in determining who may offer a prayer. The Court rejected the Fourth Circuit's opinion in \"Simpson v. Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors\", which cited \"Marsh\" and held that town boards may exclude prayers that do not fit within \"the Judeo-Christian tradition.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1862849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862849", "title": "Scrovegni Chapel", "text": "Scrovegni Chapel\n\nThe Scrovegni Chapel ( ), also known as the Arena Chapel, is a small church, adjacent to the Augustinian monastery, the \"Monastero degli Eremitani\" in Padua, region of Veneto, Italy. The chapel and monastery are now part of the complex of the Museo Civico of Padua.\n\nThe chapel contains a fresco cycle by Giotto, completed about 1305 and considered to be an important masterpiece of Western art.\n\nGiotto and his team covered all the internal surfaces of the chapel with frescoes, including the walls and the ceiling. The nave is 20.88 metres long, 8.41 metres wide, and 12.65 metres high. The apse area is composed of a square area (4.49 meters deep and 4.31 meters wide) and a pentagonal area (2.57 meters deep). The largest element is extensive cycles showing the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin. The wall at the rear of the church, through which the chapel is entered, has a large \"Last Judgement\". There are also panels in grisaille (monochrome) showing the Vices and Virtues.\n\nThe church was dedicated to \"Santa Maria della Carità\" at the Feast of the Annunciation, 1303, and consecrated in 1305. Much of Giotto's fresco cycle focuses on the life of the Virgin Mary and celebrates her role in human salvation. A motet by Marchetto da Padova appears to have been composed for the dedication on 25 March 1305. The chapel is also known as the Arena Chapel because it was built on land purchased by Enrico Scrovegni that abutted the site of a Roman arena. The space was where an open-air procession and sacred representation of the Annunciation to the Virgin had been played out for a generation before the chapel was built.\n\nThe Arena Chapel was commissioned to Giotto by the affluent Paduan banker, Enrico Scrovegni. In the early 1300s Enrico purchased from Manfredo Dalesmanini the area on which the Roman arena had stood. Here he had his luxurious palace built, as well as a chapel annexed to it. The chapel's project was twofold: to serve as the family's private oratory and as a funerary monument for himself and his wife. Enrico commissioned Giotto, the famous Florentine painter, to decorate his chapel. Giotto had previously worked for the Franciscan friars in Assisi and Rimini, and had been in Padua for some time, working for the Basilica of Saint Anthony in the Sala del Capitolo and in the Blessings's Chapel.\n\nA number of 14th-century sources (Riccobaldo Ferrarese, Francesco da Barberino, 1312–1313) testify to Giotto's presence at the Arena Chapel's site. The fresco cycle can be dated with a good approximation to a series of documentary testimonies: the purchase of the land took place on 6 February 1300; the bishop of Padua, Ottobono dei Razzi, authorised the building some time prior to 1302 (the date of his transferral to the Patriarcato of Aquileia); the chapel was first consecrated on 25 March 1303, the feast day of the Annunciation; on 1 March 1304 Pope Benedict XI granted an indulgence to whoever visited the chapel; one year later on 25 March 1305 the chapel received its definitive consecration. Giotto's work thus falls in the period from 25 March 1303 to 25 March 1305.\n\nGiotto, who was born around 1267, was 36–38 years old when he worked at Enrico Scrovegni's chapel. He had a team of about 40 collaborators, and they calculated that 625 work days (\"giornati\") were necessary to paint the chapel. A \"work day\" meant that portion of each fresco that could be painted before the plaster dried and was no longer \"fresh\" (\"fresco\" in Italian ).\n\nIn January 1305, friars from the nearby Church of the Eremitani filed a complaint to the bishop, protesting that Scrovegni had not respected the original agreement. Scrovegni was transforming his private oratory into a church with a bell tower, thus producing unfair competition with the Eremitani's activities. We do not know what happened next, but it is likely that, as a consequence of this complaint, the monumental apse and the wide transept were demolished. Both are visible on a model of the church painted by Giotto on the counter-facade (the \"Last Judgement\"). The apse was the section where Enrico Scrovegni had meant to have his tomb. The presence of frescoes dating to after 1320 supports the demolition hypothesis proposed by Giuliano Pisani. The apse, the most significant area in all churches, is where Enrico and his wife, Jacopina d'Este, were buried.\n\nThis apse presents a narrowing of the space which gives a sense of its being incomplete and inharmonious. When one observes the lower frame of the triumphal arch, right above Saint Catherine of Alexandria's small altar piece, Giotto's perfect symmetry is altered by a fresco decoration representing two medallions with busts of female saints, a lunette with Christ in glory, and two episodes from the Passion (the prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane and the Flagellation of Christ, which together give an overall sense of disharmony. The artist who painted these scenes also painted the greater part of the apse, an unknown artist called \"The Master of the Scrovegni Choir\" who worked at the Chapel about twenty years after Giotto's work was completed. The main focus of the unknown artist's work is constituted by six monumental scenes on the side walls of the chancel that depict the last period of Mary's earthly life. This choice is in tune with the iconographic program inspired by Alberto da Padova and painted by Giotto.\n\nThe chapel was originally connected with the Scrovegni palace, which was built on what remained of the foundations of the elliptical ancient Roman arena. The palace was demolished in 1827 in order to sell the precious materials it contained and to erect two condominiums in its place. The chapel was purchased by the Municipality of the City of Padua in 1881, a year after the City Council's deliberation of 10 May 1880 leading to a decision to demolish the condominiums and restore the chapel.\n\nIn June 2001, following a preparation study lasting over 20 years, the Istituto Centrale per il Restauro (Central Institute for Restoration) of the Ministry for Cultural Activities, in collaboration with Padua's Town Hall in its capacity of owner of the Arena Chapel, started a full-scale restoration of Giotto's frescoes under the late Giuseppe Basile's technical direction. In 2000 the consolidation and restoration of the external surfaces had been completed and the adjacent \"Corpo Tecnologico Attrezzato\" (CTA) had been installed. In this \"equipped technological chamber\" visitors wait for fifteen minutes to allow their body humidity to be lowered and any accompanying smog dust to be filtered out. In March 2002 the chapel was reopened to the public in its original splendor. A few problems remain unsolved, such as flooding in the crypt under the nave due to the presence of an underlying aquifer, and the negative effect on the building's stability of the cement inserts that replaced the original wooden ones in the 1960s.\n\nGiuliano Pisani's studies argued that a number of commonly held beliefs concerning the chapel are groundless, among them, the notion that Dante inspired Giotto. However, a posthumous portrait of Dante was included in the Paradise section of the frescoes. Another claim was that the theological program followed by Giotto is based on St Thomas Aquinas, whereas Pisani claims it to be wholly Augustinian. Pisani also argued against the conjecture that the Frati Gaudenti fraternity, of which Enrico Scrovegni was a member, influenced the content of Giotto's fresco cycle. He also argued against the belief that Enrico Scrovegni required that the iconography program have no emphasis placed on the sin of usury. Giuliano Pisani pointed out that Dante's condemnation of Scrovegni's father, Reginaldo, as a usurer in Canto 17 of the \"Inferno\" dates to a few years after Giotto's completion of the chapel, so it cannot be regarded as a motive behind any theological anxieties on the part of Enrico Scrovegni. It must be noted that Pisani's arguments have not yet been widely embraced by the scholarly community, and that debates persist regarding the impetus for the chapel's creation and the reasons behind its design.\n\nAccording to Pisani, Giotto painted the chapel's inner surface following a comprehensive iconographic and decorative project devised by the Augustinian theologian, Friar Alberto da Padova. Among the sources utilized by Giotto following Friar Alberto's advice are the Apocryphal Gospels of Pseudo-Matthew and Nicodemus, the Golden Legend (\"Legenda aurea\") by Jacopo da Varazze (Jacobus a Varagine) and, for a few minute iconographic details, Pseudo-Bonaventure's \"Meditations on the Life of Jesus Christ\", as well as a number of Augustinian texts, such as \"De doctrina Christiana\", \"De libero arbitrio\", \"De Genesi contra Manicheos\", \"De quantitate animae\", and other texts from the Medieval Christian tradition, among which is the \"Phisiologus\".\n\nMost Giotto scholarship believes that Giotto had made a number of theological mistakes. For instance, Giotto placed Hope after Charity in the Virtues series, and did not include Avarice in the Vices series, due to the usual representation of Enrico Scrovegni as a usurer. Giuliano Pisani asserts that Giotto followed a careful and deliberate theological programme based on Saint Augustine and devised by Friar Alberto da Padova. Avarice, far from being \"absent\" in Giotto's cycle, is portrayed with Envy, forming with it a fundamental component of a more comprehensive sin. For this reason Envy is placed facing the virtue of Charity, to indicate that Charity is the exact opposite of Envy, and that in order to cure oneself of the sin of Envy one needs to learn from Charity. Charity crushes Envy's money bag under her feet, while on the opposite wall red flames burn under Envy's feet.\n\nGiotto frescoed the chapel's whole surface, including the walls and the ceiling. The fresco cycle is organised along four tiers, each of which contains episodes from the stories of the various protagonists of the Sacred History. Each tier is divided into frames, each forming a scene. The chapel is asymmetrical in shape, with six windows on the longer south wall, and this shape determined the layout of the decoration. The first step was choosing to place two frames between each double window set on the south wall; secondly, the width and height of the tiers was fixed in order to calculate the same space on the opposite north wall.\n\nCycles of scenes showing the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin were the grandest form of religious art in the period, and Giotto's cycle is unusually large and comprehensive, showing the ambition of the commission. Allowing for this, the selection and iconography of the scenes is broadly comparable to other contemporary cycles; Giotto's innovation lies in the monumentality of his forms and the clarity of his compositions. \n\nThe cycle recounts the story of salvation. It starts from high up on the lunette of the triumphal arch, with the uncommon scene of God the Father instructing the Archangel Gabriel to perform the Annunciation to Mary. The narrative continues with the stories of Joachim and Anne (first tier from the top, south wall) and the stories of Mary (first tier from the top, north wall). After a return to the triumphal arch, the scenes of the Annunciation and the Visitation follow. The stories of Christ were placed on the middle tier of the south and north walls. The scene of Judas receiving the money to betray Jesus is on the triumphal arch. The lower tier of the south and north walls shows the Passion and Resurrection; the last frame on the north wall shows the Pentecost. The fourth tier begins at ground level with the monochromes of the Vices (north wall) and the Virtues (south wall). The west wall (counter-façade) presents the Last Judgment.\n\nThe scenes depicted are as follows:\n\nSacred stories:\n\nTriumphal arch (lunette):\n\nUpper tier, south wall:\n\nUpper tier, north wall:\nTriumphal arch:\n\nMiddle tier, south wall:\n\nMiddle tier, north wall:\n\nTriumphal arch:\n\nLower tier, south wall:\n\nLower tier, north wall;\n\nBottom tier, north wall: Vices:\n\nBottom tier, south wall: Seven virtues:\n\nCounter-façade:\n\nThe vault presents the eighth day, the time of eternity, God's time, with eight planets (the tondos which enclose the seven great prophets of the Old Testament plus John the Baptist) and two suns (which show God and the Madonna and Child), while the blue sky is studded with eight-point stars (8, sideways, symbolises infinity).\n\nThe bottom tiers of the side walls feature 14 personifications in \"grisaille\", representing single figures of Vices on the north wall and Virtues on the south wall. The Vices are \"Stultitia, Inconstantia, Ira, Iniusticia, Infidelitas, Invidia\", and \"Desperatio\". The Virtues are grouped as follows: the four cardinal virtues: \"Prudentia, Iustitia, Temperantia, Fortitudo\", followed by the three theological ones: \"Fides, Karitas, Spes\". Each virtue and vice is embedded within a mirror-like marble frame. The name of the vice or the virtue is written in Latin on top of each figure, indicating what these figures represent, namely, the seventh day (the time between Jesus's birth and the Final Judgement).\n\nAccording to the controversial theory of Giuliano Pisani, the Vices and Virtues read starting from the altar's side, going towards the counter-façade (Final Judgement), and the sequence is not \"Vices first, then Virtues\" as was long believed. It rather proceeds from Vice 1 (\"Stultitia\") (north wall, right hand side) to Virtue 1 (\"Prudencia\") (south wall, left hand side), to Vice 2 (\"Inconstantia\") (north wall) to Virtue 2 (\"Fortitudo\") (south side), and so on. Vices and Virtues symbolise humanity's progress toward bliss (heavenly happiness). With the aid of Virtues, humanity can overcome obstacles (Vices). This is the philosophical-theological itinerary designed by Giotto's theologian, a learned theologian who drew his inspiration from Saint Augustine. The Vice-Virtue section of the Arena Chapel illustrates the philosophical-theological message underlying the overall project and is key to clarifying several points previously considered to be either obscure or the result of Giotto's only approximate theological knowledge. For instance, in the Arena Chapel the vices are not the traditional capital vices or deadly sins (Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony and Lust), just like the \"corresponding\" virtues do not reflect the traditional order, consisting in four \"cardinal virtues\" (Prudence, Justice, Fortitude and Temperance) and three \"theological virtues\" (Faith, Hope and Charity). \n\nA twofold therapeutic path leading to salvation is presented. The first, composed of four virtues, brings a cure by means of the opposing force provided by the cardinal virtues. The arrival point in this first part of the itinerary is Justice, \"Iusticia\", who makes peace possible and therefore ensures Paradise on earth and earthly happiness. The first Vice in this first section is Stultitia, namely the incapacity to distinguish good and evil. Its cure (opposite wall) is \"Prudencia\", Prudence, which in classical and theological terms is not \"cautiousness\" but \"moral intelligence\" or the capacity to distinguish good and evil. The viewer is in the sphere of Knowledge. Next comes the pair \"Inconstantia\", Inconstancy, (north wall) and \"Fortitudo\", Fortitude, (south wall). Fortitude (moral and mental strength) triumphs over Inconstancy's lewd oscillations by means of will. \"Inconstancy\" is literally \"the lack of a stable seat\"; it is a mix of light-headedness, volubility, and inconsistency. \"Inconstancy\" is portrayed as a young woman rolling over a ball, ready to fall, on a motley marble floor signifying the lack of \"unity\" (\"constancy\") which characterizes an inconstant mind. Here is the sphere of Will. Wrath, the third vice, is \"tempered\" by \"Temperantia\", Temperance. According to Saint Augustine, \"Temperantia\" is the inner balance which ensures the will's stable dominion over instincts and keeps human desires within the boundaries of honesty. It is the therapy necessary to prevail over passions, which are symbolized by Wrath, because Wrath is the most perilous of all the passions: it is sudden and destructive, even against own's dearest ones, and is therefore the passion that human beings first need to learn how to control. This notion is a tenet of ancient Greek and (in its footprints) Roman philosophy, which Saint Augustine made his own and Giotto's theologian transmitted to him, fusing together a number of Saint Augustine's writings. \n\nPrudence, Fortitude and Temperance pertain to each individual's ethical sphere of action and have as their goal the cure of each individual \"self\". Ethical virtue takes form in practical application, through action and behaviour that pertain both to the personal and the social sphere and affect human relations. The notions of Justice and Injustice, the central \"pair\" in Giotto's Arena Chapel, emanate from this notion. Justice’ perfect centrality is visually emphasized by an architectural \"die\", a small cube that runs above each of the various personifications in a slightly slanted way, pointing either toward the apse or the counter-façade, everywhere but above the head of Justice (south wall) and Injustice (north wall), where the small die falls in a perpendicular line, marking at the same time the exact physical half of the chapel as well as Justice's curing function from a theological-philosophical viewpoint, without forgetting that Justice is what cures the soul of the sickening effects of Injustice (on the chapel's other side).\n\nThose who have successfully progressed in their therapeutic path have attained Justice. Those who have not, have attained Injustice. Those who have attained Justice have practiced a soul's therapy that can be defined as \"human\" and that led them to earthly happiness. They used as their therapy the \"medicina animi\", the \"soul’s medicine\" provided by the cardinal virtues (in the sequence Prudence-Fortitude-Temperance-Justice), namely the moral and intellectual virtues with whose \"medicine\" human beings can be cured of, and are able to prevail over, the opposing vices. \n\nNext come the theological virtues. In order to be able to aspire to heavenly Paradise one needs divine teaching, the revelation of truth, with which one overcomes and transcends human reason, and to practice the theological virtues. The \"divine therapy\" begins with the rejection of false beliefs (\"Infidelitas\") through Faith in God (\"Fides\"). Only with the \"medicine\" of Charity (Karitas) can man overcome Selfishness and Envy (\"Invidia\"), which lead him to look with malevolent eyes (Latin \"in-vidēre\") at his neighbour, who is also made by God in His likeness. Finally, with the aid (the medicine), Hope (\"Spes\") can be contrasted with Lack of Hope, or Desperation (\"Desperatio\"). Hope is an attitude consisting in actively waiting for God's future blessings which descend from trust in God and in His word, and also consisting in love, through the love of God, of the whole of humankind. \n\nThe sources of this extraordinary program were identified by Pisani in a number of passages of Saint Augustine's works. Everything finds a perfect correspondence with something else. It is the theme of the \"therapy of opposites\", the sequential order of the cardinal and theological virtues, and the centrality of Justice. \n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n"}

Data mapping is used as a first step for a wide variety of data integration tasks, including:\n\n\nFor example, a company that would like to transmit and receive purchases and invoices with other companies might use data mapping to create data maps from a company's data to standardized ANSI ASC X12 messages for items such as purchase orders and invoices.\n\nX12 standards are generic Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards designed to allow a company to exchange data with any other company, regardless of industry. The standards are maintained by the Accredited Standards Committee X12 (ASC X12), with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited to set standards for EDI. The X12 standards are often called ANSI ASC X12 standards.\n\nIn the future, tools based on semantic web languages such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and standardized metadata registry will make data mapping a more automatic process. This process will be accelerated if each application performed metadata publishing. Full automated data mapping is a very difficult problem (see semantic translation).\n\nData mappings can be done in a variety of ways using procedural code, creating XSLT transforms or by using graphical mapping tools that automatically generate executable transformation programs. These are graphical tools that allow a user to \"draw\" lines from fields in one set of data to fields in another. Some graphical data mapping tools allow users to \"auto-connect\" a source and a destination. This feature is dependent on the source and destination data element name being the same. Transformation programs are automatically created in SQL, XSLT, Java programming language, or C++. These kinds of graphical tools are found in most ETL (extract, transform, and load) tools as the primary means of entering data maps to support data movement. Examples include SAP BODS and Informatica PowerCenter.\n\nThis is the newest approach in data mapping and involves simultaneously evaluating actual data values in two data sources using heuristics and statistics to automatically discover complex mappings between two data sets. This approach is used to find transformations between two data sets, discovering substrings, concatenations, arithmetic, case statements as well as other kinds of transformation logic. This approach also discovers data exceptions that do not follow the discovered transformation logic.\n\nSemantic mapping is similar to the auto-connect feature of data mappers with the exception that a metadata registry can be consulted to look up data element synonyms. For example, if the source system lists \"FirstName\" but the destination lists \"PersonGivenName\", the mappings will still be made if these data elements are listed as synonyms in the metadata registry. Semantic mapping is only able to discover exact matches between columns of data and will not discover any transformation logic or exceptions between columns.\n\nData lineage is a track of the life cycle of each piece of data as it is ingested, processed, and output by the analytics system. This provides visibility into the analytics pipeline and simplifies tracing errors back to their sources. It also enables replaying specific portions or inputs of the data flow for step-wise debugging or regenerating lost output. In fact, database systems have used such information, called data provenance, to address similar validation and debugging challenges already.\n\n"}

Polypersonalism is a morphological feature of a language, and languages that display it are called polypersonal languages.\n\nIn non-polypersonal languages, the verb either shows no agreement at all or agrees with the primary argument (in English, the subject). In a language with polypersonal agreement, the verb has agreement morphemes that may indicate (as applicable) the subject, the direct object, the indirect or secondary object, the beneficiary of the verb action, etc. This polypersonal marking may be compulsory or optional (the latter meaning that some agreement morphemes can be elided if the full argument is expressed).\n\nPolysynthesis often includes polypersonalism, which in turn is a form of head-marking. Polypersonalism has also been correlated with ergativity.\n\nExamples of languages with polypersonal agreement are Basque, Georgian, Magahi, to a lesser extent Hungarian (see Definite conjugation) and several other Uralic languages such as Mansi, Mordvinic or Nenets, the Bantu languages, as well as most polysynthetic languages, like Mohawk, Inuktitut and many other Native American languages.\n\nIn Georgian, the verb consists of a root and several optional affixes. The subject and object markers might appear as suffixes or prefixes, according to the verb class, the person and number, the tense and aspect of the verb, etc.; they also interact with each other phonologically. The polypersonal verbal system of Georgian allows the verb compound to convey the meanings of subject, direct object, indirect object, genitive, locative and causative meanings. As examples of the extremely complicated Georgian verb morphology, these are some simple polypersonal verbs (hyphens indicate morpheme boundaries):\n\nAn example of a polypersonal verb that has the genitive meaning incorporated can be:\n\nHere, \"xelebi\" means \"hands.\" The second morpheme in the verb (-\"m\"-) conveys the meaning \"my.\" In Georgian this construction is very common with intransitive verbs; the possessive adjective (\"my, your\", etc.) is omitted before the subject, and the verb takes up the genitive meaning.\n\nBasque is a language isolate with a polypersonal verbal system comprising two sub-types of verbs, synthetic and analytical. The following three cases are cross-referenced on the verb: the absolutive (the case for the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct objects of transitive verbs), the ergative (the case for the subject of transitive verbs), and the dative (the case for the indirect object of a transitive verb). A dative (along with the absolutive) can also be cross-referenced on an intransitive verb without a direct object in a \"dative of interest\" type of construction (cf. English \"My car broke down on me\"), as well as in constructions involving intransitive verbs of perception or feeling. Synthetic verbs take affixes directly onto their stems, while analytical verbs use a non-finite form that carries the lexical meaning of the verb, along with a conjugated auxiliary which is either strictly transitive or intransitive. Some common auxiliaries used to conjugate analytical verbs are \"izan\" ‘be’, \"ukan\" ‘have’, and \"egin\" ‘do’. Unlike Georgian, Basque has only two really synthetic tenses able to take these affixes: present simple and past simple. Here are a few examples:\n\nSynthetic forms:\n\nAnalytical or semi-synthetic forms:\n\nIn Biblical Hebrew, or in poetic forms of Hebrew, a pronominal direct object can be incorporated into a verb's conjugation rather than included as a separate word. For example, \"ahavtikha\", with the suffix \"-kha\" indicating a masculine, singular, second-person direct object, is a poetic way to say \"ahavti otkha\" (\"I love you\"). This also changes the position of the stress; while \"ahavti\" puts the stress on \"hav\" (), \"ahavtikha\" puts it on \"ti\" ().\n\nThe same is true also of Arabic and Akkadian. A number of modern Arabic dialects incorporate both direct and indirect object pronouns, e.g. Egyptian Arabic \"he didn't write them to me\". (In Classical Arabic the equivalent would be three words: .)\n\nIn Ganda, direct and indirect pronominal objects may be incorporated into the verb as object infixes. For example:\n\nIn the second example, the applicative suffix \"-ira\" converts the (usually monotransitive) verb \"gamba\" to a ditransitive.\n\nWhile agreement with a verbal subject is compulsory, agreement with an object is required only when the object is omitted. Many other Bantu languages exhibit this feature.\n\nIn Hungarian the suffix \"-lak/-lek\" indicates a first person singular subject and a second person (either singular or plural) object. The most prominent example is \"szeretlek\" \"I love you\". The second person singular object may be omitted but the plural requires the pronoun (\"titeket\").\n\nPolypersonalism involves bound morphemes that are part of the verbal morphology and therefore cannot be found separated from the verb. These morphemes are not to be confused with pronominal clitics.\n\nSome have observed that the French pronominal clitics (common to all Romance languages) have evolved into inseparable parts of the verb in the colloquial use, and so, suggested that French could be analyzed as polypersonal.\n\n"}

{"id": "1862865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862865", "title": "Rosvall and Voutilainen", "text": "Rosvall and Voutilainen\n\nViljo Rosvall and Janne Voutilainen were two Finnish-Canadian unionists from Thunder Bay, Ontario and members of the Lumber Workers Industrial Union of Canada who mysteriously disappeared on November 18, 1929. The two were on their way to a bushcamp near Onion Lake to recruit sympathetic bushworkers for a large strike which was gaining momentum west of Thunder Bay in Shabaqua and Shebandowan.\n\nThe bodies of Rosvall and Voutilainen were found by a union search party, which included Aate Pitkanen, at Onion Lake the following spring. The men's funeral on April 28, 1930 was the largest ever held in Thunder Bay. Adding to the legendary status of the event, a solar eclipse darkened the sky as the funeral procession marched to Riverside Cemetery. The funeral events were regarded as the symbolic beginning of the Great Depression for local residents.\n\nThe official cause of death was ruled to be accidental drownings; however, the Finnish community in Thunder Bay suspected that the two were murdered by thugs employed by the bushcamp boss. Evidence that the two men had struggled before their deaths as well as the questionable matter that two experienced bushworkers had drowned in shallow water added to the feeling that foul play was involved. Furthermore, some community members claimed that they had gained knowledge that the hired thugs were in Finland, where they had been shipped after the murder.\n\nThe case of Rosvall and Voutilainen continues to be controversial. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate Rosvall and Voutilainen's role in Ontario's heritage. The plaque was erected in the memory of the two men in Centennial Park which has a small logging museum and is located approximately 20 kilometres downstream on Current River which flows out of Onion Lake where the bodies were found. The plaque reads\n\nOn November 18, 1929, Finnish-Canadians Viljo Rosvall and Janne Voutilainen left the Port Arthur area for Onion Lake, 20 kilometres upstream from here to recruit bushworkers for a strike. Their bodies were found at Onion Lake the following spring. Local unionists and many Finnish-Canadians suspected foul play, but coroner's juries ruled the deaths accidental drownings. The two men's funeral on April 28, 1930, is remembered as the largest ever held in Port Arthur. As thousands of mourners marched to Riverside Cemetery, an eclipse of the sun darkened the sky. The mystery surrounding the deaths of Rosvall and Voutilainen endures, sustaining them in public memory as martyrs to the cause of organized labour.\n\nAs an event that has seeped into more mainstream Canadian consciousness, the case of Rosvall and Voutilainen has aroused interest from academics, unionists, and authors. For instance, Michael Ondaatje's 1987 novel \"In the Skin of a Lion\" gives a fictionalized account of the murder of Rosvall and Voutilainen.\n\nHistorian Peter Raffo has carefully analyzed the oral and written evidence, and concluded, \"According to the contemporary historical record, the likelihood is that Rosvall and Voutilainen were not murdered. The oral record - the myth - does not stand up well to close examination. Practically none of its details are sustained by the facts of the case... Not martyrs so much as tragic and brave victims.\"\n\nRaffo's analysis, however, might be criticized from at least two different angles: firstly, the reliability of Raffo's access and interpretation of the oral record as a non-Finnish speaking academic; and secondly, as an interpretation based almost entirely on the \"oral record\" for evidence, largely neglecting other important elements in the case of Rosvall and Voutilainen.\n\nSatu Repo, for instance, observes in her article \"Rosvall and Voutilainen: Two Union Men Who Never Died\" that\n\nThe advances made by [social historians such as] E.P. Thompson in expanding historical writing about the working class to include the experienced, \"lived\" quality of history, the way the past felt to the contemporaries, are not easy to apply to Canadian working-class history. There are several reasons for this. Not only is it hard to find records from which to construct the subjective side of working-class lives, (this is presumably the case everywhere), but these\nrecords, even when they do exist, speak in the numerous languages of our ethnically fragmented population. The precondition to access to some of them requires a kind of double identity, an ability to be on intimate terms with some \"other\" Canadian experience, and at the same time the capability of communicating that experience to the mainstream culture. An additional problem, of course, is the highly selective nature of any such records. For obviously it is not some homogeneous working class, but certain self-conscious and articulate minorities who are likely to leave a record of any kind.\n\nRepo thus raises the question of how accurate Raffo's analysis could be, given that Raffo lacked direct access to Finnish-language sources. It could be charged further that Raffo's article is an inappropriate attempt to use a highly emotional and controversial event in Thunder Bay labour history as merely a case study in oral history.\n\nAs for the second criticism, the reliance on oral history does not address many of the facts of the case. Voutilainen was a trapper who had maintained trap lines in the Onion Lake area for several years, and thus, intimately familiar with the area. How could an experienced trapper with an intimate knowledge of the local environment fall through ice and drown in (at most) three and a half feet of water? The testimony of the official coroner, Dr. Crozier, also raises doubts. Not only was his testimony highly agitated and hostile, but Crozier also belonged to an anti-union \"citizens' group\" formed around the time of the Winnipeg General Strike. Other inconsistencies include contradictory statements from the camp boss, Maki, and evidence of injuries on the bodies suggesting a struggle before their drowning. That violent methods were used by employers, the authorities, and/or vigilantes to disrupt or discourage union activity around this time in North America is not unusual. Numerous instances such as the lynching of Frank Little, the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, the Everett Massacre, or the Estevan Riot, to name only a few, clearly show that violent and brutal means were common place in class conflict.\n\n"}

{"id": "1862874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862874", "title": "Junior commissioned officer", "text": "Junior commissioned officer\n\nJunior Commissioned Officer (JCO) is a term used for a group of military personnel which is higher than havlidars and lower than lieutenants; this term is only used by India and Pakistan. Senior havildars are promoted to JCO rank on the basis of merit and seniority, restricted by the number of vacancies. JCOs are treated as a separate class and hold many privileges. With good pay and privileges, it is an ambition of most enlisted men to attain such rank. Primarily the term was associated with armies but since 2000s India and Pakistan's navies and forces are using the term to indicate their Chief Petty Officers and Warrant Officers. The British Indian Army recruited Gurkha soldiers from Nepal since the 19th century and separate Gurkha Regiments were created for them, the Gurkha soldiers got same ranks as other Indian soldiers; the modern Nepal Army officially made the Indian Army rank system for their soldiers in 1960s through a series of reorganizations and the 'JCO' term is being used by them from then. After the secession of East Pakistan in 1971 the Bangladesh Army inherited the 'JCO' rank system from Pakistan Army though since early 2000s the army uses the Warrant Officer terms.\n\nIn the British Indian Army during the British Raj, JCOs were known as Viceroy's Commissioned Officers (VCOs) except in Nepal, which was never a British colony. Under the British, there was a clear colonial context, with the VCOs being the highest ranks that an Indian could attain while the full commissioned officers were British – a distinction which disappeared with Indian independence.\n\nA Junior Commission is signed and awarded by the Havildar's commanding officer. This type of commission is inferior to that held by full commissioned officers.\n\nIn the army, JCOs have a separate mess (the JCOs' mess), and are entitled to travel in AC 2 Tier on the railways and by air economy class (while on temporary duty or other movements). In the infantry, all JCO ranks have the word \"subedar\" in them, whereas the cavalry equivalent is \"risaldar\".\n\nThe JCO ranks in the Indian Army and the Pakistan Army (from highest to lowest) are:\n\nJCOs holding the rank of Naib Subedar or Subedar often serve as platoon commanders in an infantry company in place of lieutenants, with a major as the company commander and a captain as second-in-command. JCOs holding the rank of Subedar Major assist their battalion's commanding officer in the same way as a regimental sergeant major would, to the extent that the equivalent rank of regimental havildar major is now almost obsolete in the Indian Army. \n\nIn the Indian Army, due to their long years of service, officers accord JCOs great respect and JCOs have a great amount of influence, especially in cases involving the enlisted ranks, their welfare and morale. Another custom religiously followed is that a JCO is never addressed using just his name or rank. The word \"sahib\" (sir) is added as a suffix, e.g. a subedar named Pritam Singh would be addressed as either \"Subedar Sahib\" or \"Pritam Singh Sahib\".\n\nSailors receive a warrant on promotion to the rank of Chief Petty Officer and this is a certificate issued by the Commodore Bureau of Sailors on behalf of an admiral of India/Pakistan to authenticate the promotion of a sailor to the Chief Petty rank, as the CPO/MCPO II/MCPO I ranks are Junior Commissioned ranks. The Warrant is made on pre-printed stationery written by hand.\n\nThe JCO equivalent (or Chief Petty) ranks in the Indian Navy and Pakistan Navy are:\n\nThe JCO equivalent (or Warranted) ranks in the Indian Air Force and Pakistan Air Force are:\n\nThere is also a custom of giving honorary commissions to deserving JCOs. Every year a list of eligible JCOs is drawn up and honorary commissions awarded to them. This could be at the time of retirement, or when still in service. Honorary commissioned officers may wear the appropriate rank insignia, but they do not become members of the officers' mess. They do, however, receive the pay and pension of their honorary rank. The honorary ranks in the various forces are:\n\nIndian Army:\n\nIndian Navy:\n\nIndian Air Force:\n\nGenerally, in official documents the JCO rank held by the person is also added before the Honorary Commission rank.\n\n"}

{"id": "1862884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862884", "title": "Second mate", "text": "Second mate\n\nA second mate (2nd Mate) or second officer (2/O) is a licensed member of the deck department of a merchant ship holding a Second Mates Certificate of Competency, which is issued by the administration. The second mate is the third in command (or on some ocean liners fourth) and a watchkeeping officer, customarily the ship's navigator. Other duties vary, but the second mate is often the medical officer and in charge of maintaining distress signaling equipment. On oil tankers, the second mate usually assists the chief mate with the Cargo operations.\n\nThe Navigator's role focuses on creating the ship's passage plans. A passage plan is a comprehensive, step by step description of how the voyage is to proceed from berth to berth or one port to another. The plan includes undocking, departure, the en route portion of a voyage, approach, and mooring at the destination.\n\nThe GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System) officer role consists of performing tests and maintenance, and ensuring the proper log-keeping on the ship's Global Maritime Distress Safety System equipment. Safety equipment includes Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons, a NAVTEX unit, INMARSAT consoles, various radios, Search and Rescue Transponders, and Digital Selective Calling systems.\n\nA second mate is almost always a watchkeeper. In port and at sea, the second mate is responsible to the captain for keeping the ship, its crew, and its cargo safe for eight hours each day. Traditionally, the second mate stands a \"12-4\" watch: from midnight until 4 a.m. and noon until 4 p.m. On watch, he must enforce all applicable regulations, such as safety of life at sea and pollution regulations. In port, the watch focuses on duties such as cargo operations, fire and security watches, monitoring communications, and the anchor or mooring lines.\n\nIMO regulations require the officer be fluent in English. This is required for a number of reasons, such as to use charts and nautical publications, understand weather and safety messages, communication with other ships and coast stations, and to be able to work with a multi-lingual crew.\n\nAt sea, the mate on watch has three fundamental duties: to navigate the ship, to safely avoid traffic, and to respond to emergencies. Mates generally stand watch with able seamen who act as helmsman and lookout. The helmsman executes turns and the lookout reports dangers such as approaching ships. These roles are often combined to a single helmsman/lookout and, under some circumstances, can be eliminated completely. The ability to smartly handle a ship is key to safe watchstanding. A ship's draught, trim, speed and under-keel clearance all affect its turning radius and stopping distance. Other factors include the effects of wind and current, squat, shallow water, and similar effects. Shiphandling is key when the need arises to rescue a man overboard, to anchor, or to moor the ship.\n\nThe officer must also be able to transmit and receive signals by Morse light and to use the International Code of Signals.\n\nOn the ship the second officer is the officer that works under the Master, i.e. the Captain of the ship and shoulders the responsibility of checking the functionality of all the navigational equipment, such as the Echo-sounder, Radar, ECDIS, AIS, and on some vessels even the GMDSS radio equipment, however recently it has been observed that Companies tend to designate the responsibility of maintaining the GMDSS equipment to the third officer. These checks are made in according to the companies planned maintenance system. In addition these checks are usually made prior to arrival and departure ports. Often if any navigational equipment is suspected of being faulty then it should be checked that the equipment is in working order as per the given performance standards. \nCorrection of Navigation Charts and the duties of keeping the charts up to date rests on the Second mate. These corrections are received in the Weekly/Monthly/Annual Notices to Mariners, if Admiralty Charts are used on board. Corrections are to be made using the standard Symbols from Chart 5011. Admiralty Publication NP 294 How to Keep Charts Up to Date, should be used as a reference to maintenance of charts. However due to the introduction of the ECDIS in a phased manner that is due to be introduced on most Merchant Vessels by 2018, manual correction of charts is fast becoming obsolete. ECDIS has ushered in the age of SENC,Vector Charts these charts can be updated remotely by the broadcasts of the service provider, provided that the ship is connected to the Internet. Corrections may also be received via email, or Correction CD's depending on the service provider and your needs.\n\nCelestial, terrestrial, electronic, and coastal navigation techniques are used to fix a ship's position on a navigational chart. Accounting for effects of winds, tides, currents and estimated speed, the officer directs the helmsman to keep to track. The officer uses supplemental information from nautical publications, such as Sailing Directions, tide tables, Notices to Mariners, and radio navigational warnings to keep the ship clear of danger in transit.\n\nSafety demands the mate be able to quickly solve steering control problems and to calibrate the system for optimum performance. Since magnetic and gyrocompasses show the course to steer, the officer must be able to determine and correct for compass errors.\n\nWeather's profound effect on ships requires the officer be able to interpret and apply meteorological information from all available sources. This requires expertise in weather systems, reporting procedures, and recording systems.\n\nThe International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea are a cornerstone of safe watchkeeping. Safety requires that one live these rules and follow the principles of safe watchkeeping. Maximizing bridge teamwork, including Bridge Resource Management is an emerging focus in watchkeeping.\n\nThe main purpose for Radar and Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) on a ship's bridge are to move safely among other vessels. These tools help to accurately judge information about prominent objects in the vicinity, such as:\n\n\nThese factors help the officer apply the COLREGS to safely maneuver in the vicinity of obstructions and other ships.\n\nUnfortunately, radar has a number of limitations, and ARPA inherits those limitations and adds a number of its own. Factors such as rain, high seas, and dense clouds can prevent radar from detecting other vessels. Conditions such as dense traffic and course and speed changes can confuse ARPA units. Finally, human errors such as inaccurate speed inputs and confusion between true and relative vectors add to the limitations of the radar/ARPA suite.\n\nThe radar operator must be able to optimize system settings and detect divergences between an ARPA system and reality. Information obtained from radar and ARPA has to be treated with scrutiny: over reliance on these systems has sunk ships. The officer must understand system performance. Examples include limitations and accuracy, tracking capabilities and limitations, and processing delays, and the use of operational warnings and system tests.\n\nEmergencies can happen at any time, and the officer must be equipped to safeguard passengers and crew. After a collision or a grounding, the officer must be able to take initial action, perform damage assessment and control, and understand the procedures for rescuing persons from the sea, assisting ships in distress, and responding to any emergency which may arise in port.\n\nThe officer must understand distress signals and know the IMO Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual.\n\nThe ship's officer must be able to oversee the loading, stowage, securing and unloading of cargoes. Requirements include understanding the care of cargo during the voyage.\n\nOf particular importance is knowledge of the effect of cargo including heavy lifts on the seaworthiness and stability of the ship. The officer must also understand safe handling, stowage and securing of cargoes, including cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful.\n\nThe officer has special responsibilities to keep the ship, the people on board and the environment safe. This includes keeping the ship seaworthy during fire and loss of stability, and providing aid and maintaining safety during man overboard, abandoning ship, and medical emergencies.\n\nUnderstanding ship's stability, trim, stress, and the basics of ship's construction is a key to keeping a ship seaworthy. Competencies include knowing what to do in cases of flooding and loss of buoyancy. Fire is also a constant concern. Knowing the classes and chemistry of fire, fire-fighting appliances, and systems prepares the officer to act fast in case of fire.\n\nAn officer must be expert in the use of survival craft and rescue boats, their launching appliances and arrangements, and their equipment including radio life-saving appliances, satellite EPIRBs, SARTs, immersion suits and thermal protective aids. It's important to be expert in the techniques for survival at sea techniques in case it's necessary to abandon ship.\n\nOfficers are trained to perform medical tasks and to follow instructions given by radio or obtained from guides. This training includes what to do in case of common shipboard accidents and illnesses.\n\nTo become a second mate (unlimited) in the United States, one must have been a Third Mate and have at least 360 days of service while holding that license. Third mates who attained their licenses after the implementation of STCW 95 have passed all the examination topics required for the second mate's license, and can automatically claim the second mate's license after documenting the required service. Third mates who attained their licenses before STCW 95 must meet additional requirements.\n\nThere are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate \"sea time\" and take a series of training classes and examinations.\n\nTraining institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (deck curriculum), the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and U.S. Naval Academy with qualification as an under way officer in charge of a navigational watch, any of the state maritime colleges, the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, or a three-year apprentice mate training program approved by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nA seaman may start the process of attaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as able seaman, boatswain, or quartermaster. Then the seaman takes required training courses, and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a Third Mate's license.\n\nA master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license.\n\nIf approved the applicant must then successfully pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license. \"Hawsepiper\" is an informal maritime industry term used to refer to an officer who began his or her career as an unlicensed merchant seaman and did not attend a traditional maritime college/academy to earn the officer license. A ship’s hawsepipe is the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through. Hawsepiper refers to climbing up the hawsepipe, a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. Hawsepiper is considered a positive term when said respectfully. Most hawsepipers are proud of their background and use the term to describe themselves.\n\nSeveral merchant seamen’s unions offer their membership the required training to help them advance. Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for employee training. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training.\n\nThere have been complaints that the hawsepiper progression path has been made too difficult since the requirements of STCW 95 have been enacted. Issues include the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. Critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States.\n\nIn India the authority to issue licences rests with the Directorate General of Shipping. In order to be eligible to receive such a licence a cadet must have worked for the required amount of time and have work experience which should translate into the required amount of seatime prescribed by the administration in accordance with the STCW Code 2010. In addition he must possess various mandatory training in Life saving, Survival, Fire fighting, Bridge team Management etc. And lastly he must have cleared the 2MFG written and orals conducted by the various Mercantile Marine Departments, aka. MMD. The for the 2MFG orals a candidate may be examined by a Nautical Surveyor, Deputy Nautical Advisers or the Nautical Adviser of India.\n\nIn the 1840s personal narrative \"Two Years Before the Mast\", the author (Richard Henry Dana, Jr.) describes the role of a second mate on an American merchant trading brig as follows:\n\nThe second mate's is proverbially a dog's berth. He is neither officer nor man. The men do not respect him as an officer, and he is obliged to go aloft to reef and furl the topsails, and to put his hands into the tar and slush, with the rest. The crew call him the \"sailor's waiter,\" as he has to furnish them with spun-yarn, marline, and all other stuffs that they need in their work, and has charge of the boatswain's locker, which includes serving-boards, marline-spikes, etc. He is expected by the captain to maintain his dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great distance from the mate, and obliged to work with the crew. He is one to whom little is given and of whom much is required. His wages are usually double those of a common sailor, and he eats and sleeps in the cabin; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time, and eats at the second table, that is, makes a meal out of what the captain and chief mate leave.\n\nHowever, the role of the second mate officer (or any subordinate officer) was then very much determined by the Captain of a ship. So, as the author has described ,it is not necessarily the case with the officer in other ships. Nowadays, the role of a second officer on board any ship is that of a navigating officer; he is in charge of navigation, navigational equipment and navigational publications. He reports to the captain of the ship. Deck work charge is not expected on a second officer but he may do so. He is a licensed officer.\n\n"}

It entered into force on 6 November 1996, which was triggered by the succession of North Macedonia to the treaty giving it the requisite 15 parties.\n\nThe treaty has proven to be controversial largely because it distinguishes between \"newly independent states\" (a euphemism for former colonies) and \"cases of separation of parts of a state\" (a euphemism for all other new states). \n\nArticle 16 states that newly independent states receive a \"clean slate\", such that the new state does not inherit the treaty obligations of the colonial power, whereas article 34(1) states that all other new states remain bound by the treaty obligations of the state from which they separated. Moreover, article 17 states that newly independent states may join multilateral treaties to which their former colonizers were a party without the consent of the other parties in most circumstances, whereas article 9 states that all other new states may only join multilateral treaties to which their predecessor states were a part with the consent of the other parties.\n\nAs of February 2019, there are 23 state parties which have ratified the convention. A further 14 states signed the convention but have not ratified it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1862906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862906", "title": "Joseph McMoneagle", "text": "Joseph McMoneagle\n\nJoseph McMoneagle (born January 10, 1946, in Miami, Florida) is a retired U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer. He was involved in \"remote viewing\" (RV) operations and experiments conducted by U.S. Army Intelligence and the Stanford Research Institute. He was among the first personnel recruited for the classified program now known as the Stargate Project (1978–95). Along with colleague Ingo Swann, McMoneagle is best known for claims surrounding the investigation of RV and the use of paranormal abilities for military intelligence gathering. His interests also include near-death experiences, out-of-body travel, and unidentified flying objects.\n\nMcMoneagle describes a remarkable memory of very early childhood events. He grew up surrounded by alcoholism, abuse and poverty. As a child, he had visions at night when scared, and began to hone his psychic abilities in his teens for his own protection when he hitchhiked. He enlisted in the Army in 1964, at the age of 18, to get away from the family turmoil. McMoneagle subsequently became an experimental remote viewer while serving in U.S. Army Intelligence.\n\nMcMoneagle's early career was as an NCO and he retired after 20 years as a chief warrant officer. He was severely injured in a helicopter accident in Vietnam. He was involved in intelligence work for 15 years. From 1978, he was known as \"Remote Viewer No. 1\" at Project Stargate — the U.S. Army's psychic intelligence unit at Fort Meade, Maryland. At his retirement McMoneagle earned his Legion of Merit for his last ten years of service, including five years of work in SIGINT (SIGnals INTelligence) and five years in the RV program. He retired from the Army in 1984, but continued work as a consultant at Stargate until 1993.\n\nIn 1995, funding for Project Stargate was terminated and the unit was decommissioned after the official finding that \"no discernible benefit had been established\". McMoneagle became a speaker at the Monroe Institute, where he had previously been sent as part of his RV training. McMoneagle then ran an RV business aimed at the corporate world called Intuitive Intelligence Applications, Inc. His services included that \"he can help a wildcatter find an oil well or a quarry operator know where to mine\".\n\nAccording to McMoneagle, remote viewing is possible and accurate outside the boundaries of time. He believes he has remote-viewed into the past, present, and future and has predicted future events. Among the subjects he claims to have remote-viewed are a Chinese nuclear facility, the Iranian hostage crisis, the Red Brigades, and Muammar Qadhafi. He writes that he predicted the location and existence of the Soviet \"Typhoon\"-class submarine in 1979, and that in mid-January 1980, satellite photos confirmed those predictions. McMoneagle says the military remote viewing program was ended partly due to stigma: \"Everybody wanted to use it, but nobody wanted to be caught dead standing next to it. There's an automatic ridicule factor. 'Oh, yeah, psychics.' Anybody associated with it could kiss their career goodbye.\" Supporters of his claims include Charles Tart.\n\nAccording to author Paul H. Smith, McMoneagle predicted \"several months\" into the future, and McMoneagle's own accounts provide differing claims of accuracy of his remote viewing, varying from 5 to 95 percent to between 65 and 75 percent. McMoneagle claims that remote viewing is not always accurate but that it was able to locate hostages and downed airplanes. Of other psychics, he says that \"Ninety-eight percent of the people are kooks.\"\n\nMcMoneagle's future predictions included the passing of a teenager's \"Right to Work\" Bill, a new religion without the emphasis of Christianity, a science of the soul, a vaccine for AIDS, a movement to eliminate television, and a 'temporary tattoo' craze that would replace the wearing of clothing, all of which were supposedly to take place between 2002 and 2006.\n\nHe reports that he worked with Dean Radin at the Consciousness Research Laboratory, University of Nevada, Las Vegas to seek patentable ideas via remote viewing for a \"future machine\" Radin conceived. McMoneagle also says he has worked on missing person cases in Washington, San Francisco, New York and Chicago, as well as employing remote viewing as a time machine to make various observations such as the origin of the human species. According to McMoneagle, humans came from creatures somewhat like sea otters rather than primates and were created in a laboratory by creators who \"seeded\" the earth and then departed.\n\nMcMoneagle was featured on a National Geographic Channel episode of \"Naked Science\" along with parapsychologist Edwin C. May who tested McMoneagle's ability to \"remote view\" six locations in the San Francisco Bay area, with mixed results.\n\nIn 1994, McMoneagle appeared on an ABC network television special \"Put to the Test\" also with Edwin May who said that \"About 20 per cent of what Joe does is as close to spectacular as I can possibly wish. Scientists don't like to use the term \"miracle\" very often, but this is as close to one as you can imagine\". According to Dean Radin, \"The best psychic averages about 3 in 10, like the best baseball hitters .300, the rest of us bat about 1 or 2 in 10.\" According to paranormal researcher Brian Dunning \"The only thing I found impressive about McMoneagle's demonstration was their editing and narration job to make it look like the most amazing and miraculous psychic feat in history.\" The show took a 15-minute test and edited it down to 2 minutes leaving only what the producers felt were the best hits. After McMoneagle's vague pronouncements of a metallic sound, a pedestrian bridge, something tall that is not a building, a river or running water, something with a stripe on it and perpendicular lines.\n\nIn 1995, McMoneagle defended the Stargate program in an interview for the \"Washington Post\".\n\nMcMoneagle co-wrote an episode of the psychic science fiction show \"The Dead Zone\". In the episode, remote viewing was used in the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. USA Network, which aired \"The Dead Zone\", canceled the episode's initially scheduled broadcast because of concern about the subject matter, but did air the program a few months later, after the series returned from a mid-season hiatus.\n\nIn 2002, McMoneagle started receiving regular coverage on Nippon Television's prime-time Chounouryoku Sousakan show (roughly translated, \"FBI: Psychic Investigator\"), during which he performed remote viewings related to unsolved police cases.\n\nIn 2004, in Jon Ronson's \"Crazy Rulers of the World\" documentary (Episode 3, \"The Psychic Footsoldiers\", Channel 4), McMoneagle was interviewed and vividly described his technique for traveling \"out of body\" to Communist China to remotely view a trigger mechanism in a military nuclear weapons laboratory.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1862909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862909", "title": "Third mate", "text": "Third mate\n\nA third mate (3/M) or third officer is a licensed member of the deck department of a merchant ship. The third mate is a watchstander and customarily the ship's safety officer and fourth-in-command (fifth on some ocean liners). The position is junior to a second mate. Other duties vary depending on the type of ship, its crewing, and other factors.\n\nDuties related to the role of safety officer focus on responsibility for items such as firefighting equipment, lifeboats, and various other emergency systems.\n\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations require the officer be fluent in the English language.<ref name=\"a-ii/1\"></ref> This is required for a number of reasons. Examples include the ability to read charts and nautical publications, understand weather and safety messages, communicate with other ships and coast stations, and to successfully interact with a multi-lingual crew.\n\nEmergencies can happen at any time. The officer must be ready at all times to safeguard passengers and crew. After a collision or grounding, the mate must be able to take initial action, perform damage assessment and control, and understand the procedures for rescuing persons from the sea, assisting ships in distress, and responding to any emergency which may arise in port.\n\nThe officer must understand distress signals and know the IMO Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual.\n\nThe officer has special responsibilities to keep the ship, the people on board and the environment safe. This includes keeping the ship seaworthy during fire and loss of stability, and providing aid and maintaining safety during man overboard, abandoning ship, and medical emergencies.\n\nUnderstanding ship's stability, trim, stress, and the basics of ship's construction is a key to keeping a ship seaworthy. The mate must know what to do in cases of flooding and loss of buoyancy. Fire is also a constant concern. Knowing the classes and chemistry of fire, fire-fighting appliances and systems prepares the officer to act fast in case of fire.\n\nAn officer must be expert in the use of survival craft and rescue boats, their launching appliances and arrangements, and their equipment including radio life-saving appliances, satellite EPIRBs, SARTs, immersion suits and thermal protective aids. In case it is necessary to abandon ship, it is important to be expert in the techniques for survival at sea.\n\nOfficers are trained to perform medical tasks and to follow instructions given by radio or obtained from guides. This training includes what to do in case of common shipboard accidents and illnesses.\n\nAt sea, the mate on watch has three fundamental duties: to navigate the ship, to safely avoid traffic, and to respond to any emergencies that may arise. Mates generally stand watch with able seamen who act as helmsman and lookout. The helmsman executes turns and the lookout reports dangers such as approaching ships. These roles are often combined to a single helmsman/lookout and, under some circumstances, can be eliminated completely. The ability to smartly handle a ship is key to safe watchstanding. A ship's draught, trim, speed and under-keel clearance all affect its turning radius and stopping distance. Other factors include the effects of wind and current, squat, shallow water and similar effects. Ship handling is key when the need arises to rescue a person overboard, to anchor, or to moor the ship.\n\nThe officer must also be able to transmit and receive signals by Morse light and to use the International Code of Signals.\n\nCelestial, terrestrial, electronic, and coastal navigation techniques are used to fix a ship's position on a navigational chart. Accounting for effects of winds, tides, currents and estimated speed, the officer directs the helmsman to keep to track. The officer uses supplemental information from nautical publications, such as Sailing Directions, tide tables, Notices to Mariners, and radio navigational warnings to keep the ship clear of danger in transit.\n\nSafety demands the mate be able to quickly solve steering control problems and to calibrate the system for optimum performance. Since magnetic and gyrocompasses show the course to steer, the officer must be able to determine and correct for compass errors.\n\nWeather's profound effect on ships requires the officer be able to interpret and apply meteorological information from all available sources. This requires expertise in weather systems, reporting procedures and recording systems.\n\nThe International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea are a cornerstone of safe watchkeeping. Safety requires one lives these rules and follows the principles of safe watchkeeping. An emerging focus in watchkeeping is maximizing bridge teamwork, including the practice of Bridge Resource Management.\n\nThe main purpose for Radar and Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) on a ship's bridge is to move safely among other vessels. These instruments help to accurately judge information about prominent objects in the vicinity, such as:\n\n\nThese factors help the officer apply the COLREGS to safely maneuver in the vicinity of obstructions and other ships.\n\nUnfortunately, radar has a number of limitations, and ARPA inherits those limitations and adds a number of its own. Factors such as rain, high seas, and dense clouds can prevent radar from detecting other vessels. Moreover, dense traffic and course and speed changes can confuse ARPA units. Finally, human errors such as inaccurate speed inputs and confusion between true and relative vectors add to the limitations of the radar/ARPA suite.\n\nUnder the best conditions, the radar operator must be able to optimize system settings and detect divergences between an ARPA system and reality. Information obtained from radar and ARPA must be treated with scrutiny: over reliance on these systems has sunk ships. The officer must understand system performance, limitations and accuracy, tracking capabilities and limitations, and processing delays, and the use of operational warnings and system tests.\n\nIn port, the watch focuses on duties such as cargo operations, fire watches, security watches, monitoring communications, and monitoring the anchor or mooring lines.\n\nThe ship's officer must be able to oversee the loading, stowage, securing and unloading of cargoes. He must also understand the care of cargo during the voyage.\n\nOf particular importance is knowledge of the effect of cargo including heavy lifts on the seaworthiness and stability of the ship. The officer must also understand safe handling, stowage and securing of cargoes, including cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful.\n\nThe third mate is usually responsible for the upkeep of lifesaving and firefighting equipment. This includes a responsibility for some or all of the ship's boats, and particularly the lifeboats.\n\nThe third mate is also generally an active participant in fire and boat drills.\n\nMerchant mariners spend extended periods at sea. Most deep-sea mariners are hired for one or more voyages that last for several months. The length of time between voyages varies depending on job availability and personal preference.\n\nAt sea, these workers usually stand watch for 4 hours and are off for 8 hours, 7 days a week.\n\nPeople in water transportation occupations work in all weather conditions. Although merchant mariners try to avoid\nsevere storms while at sea, working in damp and cold conditions is inevitable. While it is uncommon nowadays for vessels to suffer disasters such as fire, explosion, or a sinking, workers face the possibility that they may have to abandon their craft at short notice if it collides with other vessels or runs aground. They also risk injury or death from falling overboard and hazards associated with working with machinery, heavy loads, and dangerous cargo. However, modern safety management procedures, advanced emergency communications, and effective international rescue systems place modern mariners in a much safer position.\n\nMost newer vessels are air-conditioned, soundproofed from noisy machinery, and equipped with comfortable living quarters. For some mariners, these amenities have helped ease the sometimes difficult circumstances of long periods away from home. Also, modern communications, especially email, link modern mariners to their families. Nevertheless, some mariners dislike the long periods away from home and the confinement aboard ship and consequently leave the occupation.\n\nInitial Officer of the Watch (OOW) Certification in the United Kingdom can be achieved through the various training programme options, these are;\n\nMNTB Deck Officer Cadet training programme (Degree Route), leading to the following qualifications:\nFoundation Degree (FdSc) in Marine Operations\nDirect pathway to BSc (Hons) Marine Operations Management\nMCA STCW’95 II/I OOW certification\n\nMNTB Deck Officer Cadet training programme (HND Route), leading to the following qualifications:\nHigher National Diploma (HND) in Nautical Science\nNVQ Level 3 in Merchant Vessel Operations\nMCA STCW’95 II/I OOW certification\n\nAlternative training programmes for Experienced Seafarers (Examination or NVQ Level 3 Routes), leading to the following qualifications:\nMCA STCW’95 II/I OOW certification\nHND Part I in Nautical Science\n\nAll entry routes require the UK candidate to have successfully undertaken STCW'95 safety and certification training in the following;\nPersonal Survival Techniques, Fire Prevention and Firefighting, Elementary First Aid, Personal Safety & Social Responsibilities, Proficiency in Medical First Aid Aboard Ship, Proficiency in Survival Craft & Rescue Boats, Advanced Firefighting, Efficient Deck Hand, MCA Signals Examination, GMDSS General Operator's Certificate and Navigation Radar & ARPA Simulation Training (Operational Level)\n\nThere are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate \"sea time\" and take a series of training classes and examinations.\n\nTraining institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (deck curriculum), or any of the other state maritime colleges. The Coast Guard Academy does not give licenses to its graduating cadets.\n\nA seaman may start the process of attaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as able seaman, boatswain, or quartermaster. Then the seaman takes required training courses and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a Third Mate's license.\n\nA master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license.\n\nIf approved the applicant must then successfully pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license. \"Hawsepiper\" is an informal term referring to an officer who did not attend a maritime college or academy and began his or her career as a seaman. The term derives from the ship’s hawsepipe: the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through. \"Coming up through the hawsepipe\" is a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. \n\nSome maritime unions offer their membership the required training for career advancement, such as the American Maritime Officers RTM-STAR Center and the Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training and Education administered by the Seafarers International Union of North America. Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training.\n\nSince the requirements of STCW '95 have been enacted, there have been complaints that the hawsepiper career path has been made too difficult. Examples include the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. Critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States.\n\nThe rate of unionization for these workers is about 36 percent, much higher than the average for all occupations. Consequently, merchant marine officers and seamen, both veterans and beginners, are hired for voyages through union hiring halls or directly by shipping companies. Hiring halls rank the candidates by the length of time the person has been out of work and fill open slots accordingly. Hiring halls typically are found in major seaports.\n\nMates employed on Great Lakes ships work 60 days and have 30 days off, but do not work in the winter when the lakes are frozen. Workers on rivers, on canals, and in harbors are more likely to have year-round work. Some work 8-hour or 12-hour shifts and go home every day. Others work steadily for a week or a month and then have an extended period off. When working, they usually are on duty for 6 or 12 hours and off for 6 or 12 hours. Those on smaller vessels are normally assigned to one vessel and have steady employment.\n\n\n\n"}

Ageia later acquired NovodeX, the company who created PhysX – a Physics Processing Unit chip capable of performing game physics calculations much faster than general purpose CPUs; they also licensed out the PhysX SDK (formerly NovodeX SDK), a large physics middleware library for game production.\n\nAgeia was noted as being the first company to develop hardware designed to offload calculation of video game physics from the CPU to a separate chip, commercializing it in the form of the Ageia PhysX, a discreet PCIe card. Soon after the Ageia implementation of their PhysX processor, \nATI and Nvidia announced their own physics implementations.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, AGEIA acquires Meqon, a physics development company based in Sweden. Known for its forward-looking features and multi-platform support, Meqon earned international acclaim in the games world for its physics technology incorporated in 3D Realms’ Duke Nukem Forever and Saber Interactive's TimeShift.\n\nOn February 4, 2008, Nvidia announced that it would acquire Ageia. On February 13, 2008, the merger was finalized.\n\nThe PhysX engine is now known as Nvidia PhysX, and has been adapted to be run on Nvidia's GPUs.\n\n"}
{"id": "1862923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862923", "title": "PhysX", "text": "PhysX\n\nPhysX is an open-source realtime physics engine middleware SDK developed by Nvidia as a part of Nvidia GameWorks software suite.\n\nInitially, video games supporting PhysX were meant to be accelerated by PhysX PPU (expansion cards designed by Ageia). However, after Ageia's acquisition by Nvidia, dedicated PhysX cards have been discontinued in favor of the API being run on CUDA-enabled GeForce GPUs. In both cases, hardware acceleration allowed for the offloading of physics calculations from the CPU, allowing it to perform other tasks instead.\n\nPhysX and other middleware physics engines are used in a large majority of today's video games because they free game developers from having to write their own code that implements classical mechanics (Newtonian physics) to do, for example, soft body dynamics.\n\nWhat is known today as PhysX originated as a physics simulation engine called NovodeX. The engine was developed by Swiss company NovodeX AG, an ETH Zurich spin-off. In 2004, Ageia acquired NovodeX AG and began developing a hardware technology that could accelerate physics calculations, aiding the CPU. Ageia called the technology PhysX, the SDK was renamed from NovodeX to PhysX, and the accelerator cards were dubbed PPUs (Physics Processing Units).\n\nThe first game to use PhysX was \"\" (2005). \n\nIn 2008, Ageia was itself acquired by graphics technology manufacturer Nvidia. Nvidia started enabling PhysX hardware acceleration on its line of GeForce graphics cards and eventually dropped support for Ageia PPUs.\n\nPhysX SDK 3.0 was released in May 2011 and represented a significant rewrite of the SDK, bringing improvements such as more efficient multithreading and a unified code base for all supported platforms.\n\nAt GDC 2015, Nvidia made the source code for PhysX available on GitHub, but required registration at developer.nvidia.com. The proprietary SDK was provided to developers for free for both commercial and non-commercial use on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS and Android platforms. \n\nOn December 3, 2018, PhysX was made open source under a 3-clause BSD license, but this change applied only to computer and mobile platforms.\n\nThe PhysX engine and SDK are available for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii, iOS and Android.\n\nPhysX is a multi-threaded physics simulation SDK. It supports rigid body dynamics, soft body dynamics (like cloth simulation, including tearing and pressurized cloth), ragdolls and character controllers, vehicle dynamics, particles and volumetric fluid simulation.\n\nA physics processing unit (PPU) is a processor specially designed to alleviate the calculation burden on the CPU, specifically calculations involving physics. PhysX PPUs were offered to consumers in the forms of PCI or PCIe cards by ASUS, BFG Technologies, Dell and ELSA Technology.\n\nBeginning with version 2.8.3 of the PhysX SDK, support for PPU cards was dropped, and PPU cards are no longer manufactured. The last incarnation of PhysX PPU standalone card designed by Ageia had roughly the same PhysX performance as a dedicated 9800GTX.\n\nAfter Nvidia's acquisition of Ageia, PhysX development turned away from PPU extension cards and focused instead on the GPGPU capabilities of modern GPUs. \n\nModern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating and displaying computer graphics, and their highly parallel structure makes them more effective than general-purpose CPUs for accelerating physical simulations using PhysX. \n\nAny CUDA-ready GeForce graphics card (8-series or later GPU with a minimum of 32 cores and a minimum of 256 MB dedicated graphics memory) can take advantage of PhysX without the need to install a dedicated PhysX card.\n\nNvidia APEX technology is a multi-platform scalable dynamics framework build around the PhysX SDK. It was first introduced in \"Mafia II\" in August 2010. Nvidia's APEX comprises the following modules: APEX Destruction, APEX Clothing, APEX Particles, APEX Turbulence, APEX ForceField and formerly APEX Vegetation which was suspended in 2011.\n\nFrom version 1.4.1 APEX SDK is deprecated.\n\nFleX is a particle based simulation technique for real-time visual effects. Traditionally, visual effects are made using a combination of elements created using specialized solvers for rigid bodies, fluids, clothing, etc. Because FleX uses a unified particle representation for all object types, it enables new effects where different simulated substances can interact with each other seamlessly. Such unified physics solvers are a staple of the offline computer graphics world, where tools such as Autodesk Maya's nCloth, and Softimage's Lagoa are widely used. The goal for FleX is to use the power of GPUs to bring the capabilities of these offline applications to real-time computer graphics.\n\nOn July 5, 2010, Real World Technologies published an analysis of the PhysX architecture. According to this analysis, most of the code used in PhysX applications at the time was based on x87 instructions without any multi-threading optimization. This could cause significant performance drops when running PhysX code on the CPU. The article suggested that a PhysX rewrite using SSE instructions may substantially lessen the performance discrepancy between CPU PhysX and GPU PhysX.\n\nIn response to the Real World Technologies analysis, Mike Skolones, product manager of PhysX, said that SSE support had been left behind because most games are developed for consoles first and then ported to the PC. As a result, modern computers run these games faster and better than the consoles even with little or no optimization.\nSenior PR manager of Nvidia, Bryan Del Rizzo, explained that multi-threading had already been available with CPU PhysX 2.x and that it had been up to the developer to make use of it. He also stated that automatic multithreading and SSE would be introduced with version 3 of the PhysX SDK.\n\nPhysX SDK 3.0 was released in May 2011 and represented a significant rewrite of the SDK, bringing improvements such as more efficient multithreading and a unified code base for all supported platforms.\n\nPhysX technology is used by game engines such as Unreal Engine (version 3 onwards), Unity, Gamebryo, Vision (version 6 onwards), Instinct Engine, Panda3D, Diesel, Torque, HeroEngine and BigWorld.\n\nAs one of the handful of major physics engines, it is used in many games, such as \"\", \"Warframe\", \"Killing Floor 2\", \"Fallout 4\", \"\", \"Borderlands 2\", etc. Most of these games use the CPU to process the physics simulations.\n\nVideo games with optional support for hardware-accelerated PhysX often include additional effects such as tearable cloth, dynamic smoke or simulated particle debris.\n\nOther software with PhysX support includes:\n\n\n"}

It is weaker than \"true\" hard-paste porcelain, and does not require either the high firing temperatures or the special mineral ingredients needed for that. There are many types, using a range of materials. The material originated in the attempts by many European potters to replicate hard-paste Chinese export porcelain, especially in the 18th century, and the best versions match hard-paste in whiteness and translucency, but not in strength. But the look and feel of the material can be highly attractive, and it can take painted decoration very well.\n\nThe ingredients varied considerably, but always included clay, often ball clay, and often ground glass, bone ash, soapstone (steatite), flint, and quartz. They rarely included the key ingredients necessary for hard-paste, china clay including kaolin, or the English china stone, although some manufacturers included one or other of these, but failed to get their kilns up to a hard-paste firing temperature. They were called \"soft paste\" (after the French \"pâte tendre\") either because the material is softer in the kiln, and prone to \"slump\", or their firing temperatures are lower compared with hard-paste porcelain, or, more likely, because the finished products actually are far softer than hard-paste, and early versions were much easier to scratch or break, as well as being prone to shatter when hot liquid was suddenly poured into them.\n\nThe German Meissen porcelain had developed hard-paste porcelain by 1708, and later German factories usually managed to find the secret out from former Meissen employees, beginning with Vienna porcelain in 1718. The other European countries had much longer to wait, but most factories eventually switched from soft to hard-paste, having discovered both the secret and a source of kaolin. In France kaolin was only found in Limousin in 1768, and Sèvres produced both types from 1769, before finally dropping soft-paste in 1804. In England there was a movement in a different direction, as Spode's formula for bone china, developed in the 1790s, was adopted by most other factories by about 1820. By that point little soft-paste porcelain was being made anywhere, and little hard-paste in England, with Nantgarw and Swansea in Wales among the last factories making soft-paste. \n\nThere were early attempts by European potters to replicate Chinese porcelain when its composition was little understood and its constituents were not widely available in the West. The earliest formulations were mixtures of clay and ground-up glass (frit). Soapstone (steatite) and lime are also known to have been included in some compositions. The first successful attempt was Medici porcelain, produced between 1575 and 1587. It was composed of white clay containing powdered feldspar, calcium phosphate and wollastonite (CaSiO3), with quartz. Other early European soft-paste porcelain, also a frit porcelain, was produced at the Rouen manufactory in 1673, which was known for this reason as \"Porcelaine française\". Again, these were developed in an effort to imitate high-valued Chinese hard-paste porcelain. As these early formulations slumped in the kiln at high temperatures, they were difficult and uneconomic to use. Later formulations used kaolin (china clay), quartz, feldspars, nepheline syenite and other feldspathic rocks. Soft-paste porcelain with these ingredients was technically superior to the traditional soft-paste and these formulations remain in production.\n\nSoft-paste formulations containing little clay are not very plastic and shaping it on the potter's wheel is difficult. Pastes with more clay (now more commonly referred to as \"bodies\"), such as electrical porcelain, are extremely plastic and can be shaped by methods such as jolleying and turning. The feldspathic formulations are, however, more resilient and suffer less pyroplastic deformation. Soft-paste is fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, typically around 1100 °C for the frit based compositions and 1200 to 1250 °C for those using feldspars or nepheline syenites as the primary flux. The lower firing temperature gives artists and manufacturers some benefits, including a wider palette of colours for decoration and reduced fuel consumption. The body of soft-paste is more granular than hard-paste porcelain, less glass being formed in the firing process.\n\nAccording to one expert, with a background in chemistry, \"The definition of porcelain and its soft-paste and hard-paste varieties is fraught with misconceptions\", and various categories based on the analysis of the ingredients have been proposed instead. Some writers have proposed a \"catch-all\" category of \"hybrid\" porcelain, to include bone china and various \"variant\" bodies made at various times. This includes describing as \"hybrid soft-paste porcelain\" pieces made using kaolin but apparently not fired at a sufficiently high temperature to become true hard-paste, as with some 18th-century English and Italian pieces.\nAt least in the past, some sources dealing with modern industrial chemistry and pottery production have made a completely different distinction between \"hard porcelain\" and \"soft porcelain\", by which all forms of pottery porcelain, including East Asian wares, are \"soft porcelain\".\n\nChinese porcelain, which arrived in Europe before the 14th century, was much admired and expensive to purchase. Attempts were made to imitate it from the 15th century onwards but its composition was little understood. Its translucency suggested that glass might be an ingredient, so many experiments combined clay with powdered glass (frit), including the porcelain made in Florence in the late 16th century under the patronage of the Medicis. In Venice there were experiments supposedly using opaque glass alone.\n\nGerman factories either made hard-paste from their foundation, like Meissen, Vienna, Ludwigsburg, Frankenthal and later factories, or obtained the secret and switched. France did in fact make hard-paste at Strasbourg in 1752-54, until Louis XV gave his own factory, Vincennes, a monopoly, at which point the factory moved to become the Frankenthal operation.\n\nEarly factories in France, England, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland and other countries made soft-paste, the switch to hard-paste generally coming after 1750, with France and England rather in the rear, as explained below. The American China Manufactory (or Bonnin and Morris) in Philadelphia, America's first successful porcelain factory, also made soft-paste from about 1770-72. \n\nExperiments at the Rouen manufactory produced the earliest soft-paste in France, when a 1673 patent was granted to Louis Poterat, but it seems that not much was made. An application for the renewal of the patent in 1694 stated, \"the secret was very little used, the petitioners devoting themselves rather to faience-making\". Rouen porcelain, which is blue painted, is rare and difficult to identify.\n\nThe first important French porcelain was made at the Saint-Cloud factory, which was an established maker of faience. In 1702, letters-patent were granted to the family of Pierre Chicaneau, who were said to have improved upon the process discovered by him, and since 1693 to have made porcelain as \"perfect as the Chinese\". The typical blue-painted Saint-Cloud porcelain, says Honey, \"is one of the most distinct and attractive of porcelains, and not the least part of its charm lies in the quality of the material itself. It is rarely of a pure white, but the warm yellowish or ivory tone of the best wares of the period is sympathetic and by no means a shortcoming; and while actually very soft and glassy, it has a firm texture unlike any other. The glaze often shows a fine satin-like pitting of the surface that helps to distinguish it from the brilliant shiny glaze of Mennecy, which is otherwise similar. The heavy build of the pieces is also characteristic and is saved from clumsiness by a finer sense of mass, revealed in the subtly graduated thickness of wall and a delicate shaping of edges.\"\n\nLouis Henry de Bourbon, prince de Condé established a soft-paste factory on the grounds of his château de Chantilly in 1730; Chantilly porcelain continued to be made after his death in 1740.\n\nA soft-paste factory was opened at Mennecy by François Barbin in 1750. The Vincennes porcelain factory was established in 1740 under the supervision of Claude-Humbert Gérin, who had previously been employed at Chantilly. The factory moved to larger premises at Sèvres in 1756. A superior soft-paste was developed at Vincennes, whiter and freer of imperfections than any of its French rivals, which put Vincennes/Sèvres porcelain in the leading position in France and throughout the whole of Europe in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nThe use of frit in this paste lent it the names \"\"Frittenporzellan\"\" in Germany and \"\"frita\"\" in Spain. In France it was known as \"\"pâte tendre\"\" and in England \"soft-paste\", perhaps because it does not easily retain its shape in the wet state, or because it tends to slump in the kiln under high temperature, or because the body and the glaze can be easily scratched. (Scratching with a file is a crude way of finding out whether a piece is made of soft-paste or not.)\n\nThe first soft-paste in England was demonstrated by Thomas Briand to the Royal Society in 1742 and is believed to have been based on the Saint-Cloud formula. In 1749, Thomas Frye, a portrait painter, took out a patent on a porcelain containing bone ash. This was the first bone china, subsequently perfected by Josiah Spode.\n\nRecipes were closely guarded, as illustrated by the story of Robert Brown, a founding partner in the Lowestoft factory, who is said to have hidden in a barrel in Bow to observe the mixing of their porcelain. A partner in Longton Hall referred to \"the Art, Secret or Mystery\" of porcelain.\n\nIn the fifteen years after Briand's demonstration, several factories were founded in England to make soft-paste table-wares and figures:\n\nUnlike the European product, Chinese porcelain began with hard-paste, and it is common to regard all Chinese production as hard-paste, until bone china began to be made there in the 20th century. However, a classification of \"Chinese soft-paste porcelain\" is often recognised by museums and auction-houses, though its existence may be denied by others. \n\nIt refers to pieces of Chinese porcelain, mostly from the first half of the 18th century, that are less translucent than most Chinese porcelain and have a rather milky-white glaze, which is prone to crackling. Some regard it as essentially made from a hard-paste body that did not reach a sufficiently high firing temperature, or uses a different glaze formula. It takes underglaze cobalt blue painting especially well, which is one of the factors leading it to be identified as the wares using a mineral ingredient called \"huashi\", mentioned by Father François Xavier d'Entrecolles in his published letters describing Chinese production. It used to be thought that the special ingredient was soapstone (aka \"French chalk\", a form of steatite), as used in some English porcelain. However chemical analsis of samples shows no sign of this.\n\nHard-paste porcelain was successfully produced at Meissen in 1708 by Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus, though Johann Friedrich Böttger who continued his work has often been credited with the discovery of this recipe. As the recipe was kept secret, experiments continued elsewhere, mixing glass materials (fused and ground into a frit) with clay or other substances to give whiteness and a degree of plasticity. Plymouth porcelain, founded in 1748, which moved to Bristol soon after, was the first English factory to make hard-paste.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1862934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862934", "title": "Inosinic acid", "text": "Inosinic acid\n\nInosinic acid or inosine monophosphate (IMP) is a nucleotide (that is, a nucleoside monophosphate). Widely used as a flavor enhancer, it is typically obtained from chicken byproducts or other meat industry waste. Inosinic acid is important in metabolism. It is the ribonucleotide of hypoxanthine and the first nucleotide formed during the synthesis of purine nucleotides. It can also be formed by the deamination of adenosine monophosphate by AMP deaminase. It can be hydrolysed to inosine.\n\nThe enzyme deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, encoded by YJR069C in \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" and containing (d)ITPase and (d)XTPase activities, hydrolyzes inosine triphosphate (ITP) releasing pyrophosphate and IMP.\n\nImportant derivatives of inosinic acid include the purine nucleotides found in nucleic acids and adenosine triphosphate, which is used to store chemical energy in muscle and other tissues.\n\nIn the food industry, inosinic acid and its salts such as disodium inosinate are used as flavor enhancers. It is known as E number reference E630.\n\nThe inosinate synthesis is complex, beginning with a 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). In the first step, an amino group given by glutamine is attached at carbon 1 of PRPP. The resulting molecule is 5-phosphoribosylamine, which is highly unstable, with a half-life of 30 seconds at physiologic pH. 5-Phosphoribosylamine gains an amino acid (glycine), becoming glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR). Then, N10-formyltetrahydrofolate (tetrahydrofolate) transfers a formyl group to glycinamide ribonucleotide to form formyl glycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR).\n\nUsing an ATP molecule, glutamine donates an NH group which is added to the compound by the enzyme PFAS, replacing an oxygen atom and forming formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide. Another ATP molecule causes an intermolecular reaction that produces an imidazole ring (5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide).\n\nThe next step of the pathway is adding bicarbonate to make carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide by using ATP (this only happens in fungi and bacteria; high eukaryotes add CO to form the ribonucleotide). Then, the imidazole’s carboxylate group phosphatises and adds aspartate.\n\nThis six-step process links glycine, formate, bicarbonate, glutamine, and aspartate to lead to an intermediate that contains almost all the required atoms to synthesize a purine ring. This intermediate loses fumarate, and then a second formyl group from tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) is added. The compound undergoes another ring closure to form inosinate. Inosinate is the first intermediate in this synthesis pathway to have a whole purine ring.\n\nEnzymes taking part in IMP synthesis constitute a multienzyme complex in the cell. Evidence demonstrates that there are multifunctional enzymes, and some of them catalyze non-sequential steps in the pathway.\n\nWithin a few steps inosinate becomes AMP or GMP. Both compounds are RNA nucleotides. AMP differs from inosinate by the replacement of IMP's carbon-6 carbonyl with an amino group. The interconversion of AMP and IMP occurs as part of the purine nucleotide cycle. GMP is formed by the inosinate oxidation to xanthylate (XMP), and afterwards adds an amino group on carbon 2. Hydrogen acceptor on inosinate oxidation is NAD+. Finally, carbon 2 gains the amino group by spending an ATP molecule (which becomes AMP+2Pi). While AMP synthesis requires GTP, GMP synthesis uses ATP. That difference offers an important regulation possibility.\n\nInosinate and many other molecules inhibit the synthesis of 5-phosphorybosilamine from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), disabling the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction: glutamine-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate-amidotransferase. In other words, when levels of inosinate are high, glutamine-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate-amidotransferase is inhibited, and, as a consequence, inosinate levels decrease. Also, as a result, adenylate and guanylate are not produced, which means that RNA synthesis cannot be completed because of the lack of these two important RNA nucleotides.\n\nInosinic acid can be converted into various salts including disodium inosinate (E631), dipotassium inosinate (E632), and calcium inosinate (E633). These three compounds are used as flavor enhancers for the basic taste umami with a comparatively high effectiveness. They are mostly used in soups, sauces, and seasonings for the intensification and balance of the flavor of meat.\n\n"}

It was first made in China around the 7th or 8th century, and has remained the most common type of Chinese porcelain. \n\nFrom the Middle Ages onwards it was very widely exported and admired by other cultures, and fetched huge prices on foreign markets. Eventually Korean porcelain developed in the 14th century and Japanese porcelain in the 17th, but other cultures were unable to learn or reproduce the secret of its formula in terms of materials and firing temperature until it was worked out in Europe in the early 18th century, and suitable mineral deposits of kaolin, feldspar and quartz discovered. This soon led to a large production in factories across Europe by the end of the 18th century. \n\nDespite the huge influence of Chinese porcelain decoration on Islamic pottery, historic production in the Islamic world was all in earthenware or fritware, the latter having some of the properties of hard-paste porcelain. Europeans also developed soft-paste porcelain, fired at lower temperatures (around 1200 °C), while trying to copy the Chinese, and later bone china which in modern times has somewhat replaced hard-paste across the world, even in China.\n\nChinese porcelain began to be exported to Europe by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch from the middle of the 16th century, creating vast demand for the material. The discovery in Europe of the secret of its manufacture has conventionally been credited to Johann Friedrich Böttger of Meissen, Germany in 1708, but it has also been claimed that English manufacturers or Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus produced porcelain first. Certainly, the Meissen porcelain factory, established 1710, was the first to produce porcelain in Europe in large quantities and since the recipe was kept a trade secret by Böttger for his company, experiments continued elsewhere throughout Europe. Vienna porcelain became the second European manufacturer in 1718, followed by Vezzi porcelain in Venice in 1720.\n\nIn 1712, the French Jesuit François Xavier d'Entrecolles described the Chinese process of manufacturing porcelain in his letters to Europe. In 1771, the comte de Milly published \"L'art de la porcelaine\", a detailed account of the processes of creating hard-paste porcelain, ending its prestige as a rare and valuable material.\n\nHard-paste now chiefly refers to formulations prepared from mixtures of kaolin, feldspar and quartz. Other raw materials can also be used and these include pottery stones, which historically were known as petunse although this name has long fallen out of use.\n\nHard-paste porcelain is now differentiated from soft-paste porcelain mainly by the firing temperature, with the former being higher, to around 1400°C, and the latter to around 1200°C. Depending on the raw materials and firing methods used, hard-paste porcelain can also resemble stoneware or earthenware. Hard-paste porcelain can also be used for unglazed biscuit porcelain. It is a translucent and bright, white ceramic. Hard-paste has the advantage over soft-paste that it is less likely to crack when exposed to hot liquids, but the higher firing temperature of hard-paste may necessitate a second \"glost\" firing for the decoration.\n\n"}

Presented at the 1993 Geneva Motor Show, the Guarà was initially available in coupé body-style. Later a roadster and an open-top barchetta bodystyle became available. The latter corresponds to the coupé but without roof and proper windscreen; a small air deflector protects the passenger and the driver from the passing wind and the car had to be driven while wearing a helmet.\n\nThe Guarà is based on the Maserati Barchetta Stradale prototype from 1991 which was meant to be the street-legal variant of the track-only car. A take-over of Maserati by Fiat prevented Alejandro de Tomaso from realising such a variant of the Barchetta manufactured by Maserati as Maserati ceased production of the Barchetta under its new owner. The car was thus manufactured by De Tomaso and was named Guarà. The Guarà was designed by Carlo Gaino of \"Synthesis Design\" who also designed the Maserati Barchetta.\n\nThe first cars (mainly Coupés) were sold in 1994 and with some interruptions the Coupé and the Barchetta still were available (prepayment in full required) in 2005/2006 in Italy, Austria and Switzerland. However, it seems there were no cars built after 2004 when the company went into liquidation. The last car, ordered by an Austrian in 2004, was only delivered in 2011 after De Tomaso's liquidation was completed.\n\nThough sources vary, approximately fifty two cars in total were built.

The suspension is a reminiscent of Formula 1 and IndyCar technology with independent upper and lower wishbone with pushrod front and rear end suspension having rose-joints designed by famed Formula 1 car engineer Enrique Scalabroni. The Guarà is known for its highly agile handling which makes it a bit too \"nervous\" for the average driver. The Guarà has no luggage space at all as the area under the front is utilised by the racing-style suspension. The large, distinct wheels are manufactured by Marchesini.\n\nEarly variants of the Guará used the 4.0-litre BMW M60 V8 engine shared with the BMW 840Ci. This was due to Ford's inability to supply engines for the car. The engine was modified by De Tomaso and had different timing belt routing. The engine has a power output of . A six-speed manual transmission made by Getrag was used to drive the rear wheels and it had a gated shifter for easier gear changes. The engine has a red-line of 7,000 rpm. Later variants switched to a 4.6-litre supercharged cast-iron block V8 engine from Ford primarily because BMW phased out the engine. The Ford engine has a power output of . The brakes are from Brembo and were non-servo assisted. The brakes were similar to those used on the Ferrari F40.

{"id": "1863001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863001", "title": "Bone china", "text": "Bone china\n\nBone china is a type of porcelain that is composed of bone ash, feldspathic material, and kaolin. It has been defined as \"ware with a translucent body\" containing a minimum of 30% of phosphate derived from animal bone and calculated calcium phosphate. Bone china is the strongest of the porcelain or china ceramics, having very high mechanical and physical strength and chip resistance, and is known for its high levels of whiteness and translucency. Its high strength allows it to be produced in thinner cross-sections than other types of porcelain. Like stoneware it is vitrified, but is translucent due to differing mineral properties.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, English potters had not succeeded in making hard-paste porcelain (as made in East Asia and Meissen porcelain) but found bone ash a useful addition to their soft-paste porcelain mixtures, giving strength. This became standard at the Bow porcelain factory in London (operating from around 1747), and spread to some other English factories. The modern product was developed by the Staffordshire potter Josiah Spode in the early 1790s. Spode included kaolin, so his formula, sometimes called \"Staffordshire bone-porcelain\", was effectively hard-paste, but stronger, and versions were adopted by all the major English factories by around 1815.\n\nFrom its initial development and up to the latter part of the 20th century, bone china was almost exclusively an English product, with production being effectively localised in Stoke-on-Trent. Most major English firms made or still make it, including Spode, Royal Crown Derby, Royal Doulton, Wedgwood, Mintons, and Worcester. In the 20th century it began to be made elsewhere, especially in China and Japan, and China is now the world's largest manufacturer. \n\nIn the UK, references to \"china\" or \"porcelain\" can refer to bone china, and \"English porcelain\" has been used as a term for it, both in the UK and around the world.\n\nThe first development of what would become known as bone china was made by Thomas Frye at his Bow porcelain factory near Bow in East London in 1748. His factory was located very close to the cattle markets and slaughterhouses of London and Essex, and hence easy access to animal bones. Frye used up to 45% bone ash in his formulation to create what he called \"fine porcelain\".\nLater, Josiah Spode in Stoke-on-Trent further developed the concept between 1789 and 1793, introducing his \"Stoke China\" in 1796. He died suddenly the year later, and his son Josiah II quickly rechristened the ware \"Bone china\". Among his developments was to abandon Frye's procedure of calcining the bone together with some of the other raw body materials, instead calcining just the bone. Bone china quickly proved to be highly popular, leading to its production by other English pottery manufacturers. Both Spode's formulation and his business were successful: his formulation of 6 parts bone ash, 4 parts china stone and 3.5 parts china clay, remains the basis for all bone china, and it was only in 2009 that his company, Spode, went into receivership before eventually being purchased by Portmeirion.\n\nThe production of bone china is similar to porcelain, except that more care is needed because of its lower plasticity and a narrower vitrification range. The traditional formulation for bone china is about 25% kaolin, 25% Cornish stone and 50% bone ash. The bone ash that is used in bone china is made from cattle bones that have a lower iron content. These bones are crushed before being degelatinised and then calcined at up to 1250 °C to produce bone ash. The ash is milled to a fine particle size. The kaolin component of the body is needed to give the unfired body plasticity which allows articles to be shaped. This mixture is then fired at around 1200 °C. The raw materials for bone china are comparatively expensive, and the production is labour-intensive, which is why bone china maintains a luxury status and high pricing.\n\nBone china consists of two crystalline phases, anorthite (CaAlSiO) and β-tricalcium phosphate/whitlockite (Ca(PO)) embedded in a substantial amount of glass.\n\nFor almost 200 years from its development bone china was almost exclusively produced in the UK. During the middle part of the 20th century manufacturers in other countries began production, with the first successful ones outside the UK being in Japan: Noritake, Nikko and Narumi. \n\nIn more recent years production in China has expanded considerably, and the country is now the biggest producer of bone china in the world. Other countries producing considerable amounts of bone china are Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Iran, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\nFrom the start of the first factory, Bengal Potteries, in 1964, bone china output from Indian factories had risen to 10,000 tonnes per year by 2009. Rajasthan has become a hub for bone china in India, with production in the state totaling 16-17 tonnes per day.\n\nIn Leningrad, USSR, the bone china recipe was invented independently, since it was not possible to get the finished recipe. The production of bone china at the Lomonosov Porcelain Factory (Leningradsky Farforovii Zavod - ЛФЗ (LFZ) (after the collapse of the USSR, the historical name IFZ was returned to it) began only in the 1960s. The recipe obtained by the plant’s specialists made it possible to create porcelain, the products from which were obtained thinner and whiter than English products from bone china. This was achieved thanks to the special regime of firing thin-walled products from bone china, and all formulation developers received USSR State Awards.\nUntil now, ЛФЗ (ИФЗ) in Saint-Petersburg, Russia)] remains the only company in Russia that produces bone china products.\n\nLenox was the only major manufacturer of bone china in the United States, and has supplied presidential services to the White House. It closed production in the US permanently in March 2020.\n\nIn the 21st century, \"Islamic bone china\" became available, using only bone ash from halal animals, as well as (more conventionally) clay and a high firing temperature. Due to the use of animal bones in the production of bone china, some vegetarians and vegans avoid using or purchasing it.\n"}

The rugby ground is the home of Gala RFC and was formerly used by the professional Border Reivers team. It hosted one match of the 1999 Rugby World Cup. It has also occasionally been used for rugby league matches. The football ground is home to Gala Fairydean Rovers and has a Category A listed grandstand.\n\nThe Netherdale complex is located on Nether Road towards the east end of Galashiels, near the River Tweed. The Gala rugby ground is in the north-west corner of the site, with the Gala Fairydean Rovers football ground in the south-west; the two grounds are joined end-to-end. The rest of the site is taken up by a number of undeveloped rugby and football fields known as the back pitches. Gala RFC moved to the area in 1912 from their previous ground at Mossilee, initially playing on what is now the football ground before the construction of their present ground – \"New Netherdale\" – in 1961-62.\n\nGala Fairydean F.C. arrived at Netherdale in 1929, initially playing on an undeveloped pitch called Raid Stane Park, before taking over the old rugby ground. Local amateur club Gala Rovers F.C. also played at the Netherdale complex before the two clubs merged to form Gala Fairydean Rovers in 2013. Since the installation of a 3G pitch in 2011, the Fairydean ground is officially known as the 3G Arena Netherdale and is also used as a community football and rugby facility.\n\nGala RFC had previously played at the Public Park and Mossilee before moving to Netherdale in 1912, where their new ground incorporating a pavilion and grandstand was built at a cost of £1,150. The first rugby match took place in September 1912, against local rivals Hawick. The rugby club continued to play on this part of the ground until the construction of the adjacent \"New Netherdale\" in 1961–62.\n\nThe football stadium has a capacity of around 2,000. The ground’s most striking feature is the main stand, which was opened in 1964. With a capacity of 500 it is the largest stand in the Scottish Borders. Designed by the renowned British architect Peter Womersley in the brutalist style, the concrete structure is sometimes sarcastically dubbed as “the San Siro of the Borders.” It was awarded a 'B' category listing by Historic Scotland in December 2006, which means the \"character and setting\" of the building must be preserved for \"future generations\". \n\nHistoric Scotland upgraded its listing to 'A' category in December 2013, stating that the stand is \"a significant work of late modernist architecture in Scotland\". The stand was closed during the 2018–19 season, pending works needed to repair water damage to the concrete.\n\nThe rugby stadium has a large grandstand which overlooks the pitch and the nearby Eildon Hills. While the professional Border Reivers club played, a second fully seated stand was installed, increasing the capacity to around 4,000 from the previous 2,000. New pitch protection systems were installed, which the Scottish Rugby Union continued to pay the maintenance costs for even after the Border Reivers club was closed. \n\nThe stadium hosted the 1999 Rugby World Cup Pool A match between Uruguay and Spain.\n\nNetherdale has also hosted rugby league international matches, firstly the match between Scotland and France on 31 October 2014 as part of the 2014 European Cup. France won that match 38-22. As part of the 2015 European Cup, Netherdale hosted the match between Scotland and Ireland on 23 October.\n"}
{"id": "1863017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863017", "title": "Cape Verdean Creole", "text": "Cape Verdean Creole\n\nCape Verdean Creole is a Portuguese-based creole language spoken on the islands of Cape Verde. It is also called or by its native speakers. It is the native creole language of virtually all Cape Verdeans and is used as a second creole language by the Cape Verdean diaspora.\n\nThe creole has particular importance for creolistics studies since it is the oldest (still-spoken) creole. It is the most widely spoken Portuguese-based creole language.\n\nThe correct designation of this creole is Cape Verdean Creole. However, in everyday usage the creole is simply called ('Creole') by its speakers. The names Cape Verdean ( in Portuguese, in Cape Verdean Creole) and Cape Verdean language ( in Portuguese, in the Sotavento dialect of Cape Verdean Creole and in the Barlavento dialect) have been proposed for whenever the creole will be standardized.\n\nThe history of Cape Verdean Creole is hard to trace due to a lack of written documentation and to ostracism during the Portuguese administration of Cape Verde.\n\nThere are presently three theories about the formation of Creole. The monogenetic theory claims that the creole was formed by the Portuguese by simplifying the Portuguese language in order to make it accessible to African slaves. That is the point of view of authors like Prudent, Waldman, Chaudenson and Lopes da Silva. Authors like Adam and Quint argue that Creole was formed by African slaves using the grammar of Western African languages and replacing the African lexicon with the Portuguese one. Linguists like Chomsky and Bickerton argue that Creole was formed spontaneously, not by slaves from continental Africa, but by the population born in the islands, using the grammar with which all human beings are born; this would explain how creoles located many miles apart have similar grammatical structures, even though they have a different lexical basis.\n\nAccording to A. Carreira, Cape Verdean Creole was formed from a Portuguese pidgin, on the island of Santiago, starting from the 15th century. That pidgin was then transported to the west coast of Africa by the \"lançados\". From there, that pidgin diverged into two proto-Creoles, one that was the base of all Cape Verdean Creoles, and another that was the base of the Guinea-Bissau Creole.\n\nCross referencing information regarding the settlement of each island with the linguistic comparisons, it is possible to form some conjectures. The spreading of Cape Verdean Creole within the islands was done in three phases:\n\nIn spite of Creole being the first language of nearly all the population in Cape Verde, Portuguese is still the official language. As Portuguese is used in everyday life (at school, in administration, in official acts, in relations with foreign countries, etc.), Portuguese and Cape Verdean Creole live in a state of diglossia. Due to this overall presence of Portuguese, a decreolization process occurs for all the different Cape Verdean Creole variants.\n\nCheck in this fictional text:\n\nIn this text, several situations of decreolization / Portuguese intromission can be noted:\n\nThe same text \"corrected\":\n\nAs a consequence there is a continuum between basilectal and acrolectal varieties.\n\nIn spite of Creole not being officialized, there exists a governmental directive that puts forth the necessary conditions for the officialization of Creole. This officialization has not yet occurred, mostly because the language is not yet standardized, for several reasons:\n\nThat is the reason why each speaker when speaking (or writing) uses their own dialect, their own sociolect, and their own idiolect.\n\nTo overcome these problems, some Creole advocates propose the development of two standards: a North (Barlavento) standard, centered on the São Vicente variant, and a South (Sotavento) standard, centered on that of Santiago. If so, Creole would become a pluricentric language\n\nThere exists no complete translation of the Bible. However, the \"Asosiason Kabuverdianu pa Traduson di Bíblia\" was established with the goal of translating the entire Bible in Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu and Kabuverdianu-Barlaventu (see https://web.archive.org/web/20180809164421/http://aktb.org/). They have translated approximately 40% of the New Testament in the Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu, and they have published Luke and Acts. The publication of Luke has won two awards in Cape Verde. Sérgio Frusoni translated Bartolomeo Rossetti's version of the Romanesco Italian poem \"Er Vangelo Seconno Noantri\", which is a poem based on the Four Gospels. Frusoni translated the poem in the São Vicente Creole, \"Vangêle contód d'nôs móda\".\n\nThe only writing system officially recognized by the authorities in Cape Verde is called ALUPEC. In spite of having been officially recognized by the government, the ALUPEC is neither officially nor mandatorily used, instead used only by enthusiasts.\n\nIn spite of being the only system officially recognized, the same law allows the use of alternative writing models, \"as long as they are presented in a systematic and scientific way\". As not all users are familiarized with ALUPEC or the IPA, in this article a slightly different system will be used to make it easier for the reader:\n\nThe vocabulary of Cape Verdean Creole comes mainly from Portuguese. Although several sources do not agree, the figures oscillate between 90 and 95% of words from Portuguese. The remaining comes from several languages from Western Africa (Mandingo, Wolof, Fulani, Temne, Balanta, Mandjak, etc.), and the vocabulary from other languages (English, French, Latin) is negligible.\n\nCape Verdean Creole's phonological system comes mainly from 15th-through-17th-century Portuguese. In terms of conservative features, Creole has kept the affricate consonants and (written \"j\" (in the beginning of words) and \"ch\", in old Portuguese) which are not in use in today's Portuguese, and the pre-tonic vowels were not reduced as in today's European Portuguese. In terms of innovative features, the phoneme (written \"lh\" in Portuguese) has evolved to and the vowels have undergone several phonetic phenomena.\n\nThere are eight oral vowels and their corresponding nasal counterparts, making a total of sixteen vowels:\n\n\nThe personal pronoun that represents the subject form of the first person singular has a variable pronunciation according to the islands.\n\nThis pronoun comes from the object form of the first person singular in Portuguese \"mim\", and it is phonetically reduced to the sound .\n\nThis pronunciation is nowadays found in the Barlavento variants. In the Sotavento variants that consonant was reduced to a simple nasality . For example: \"m' andâ\" ('I have walked'), \"m' stâ tâ sintí\" ('I am feeling'), \"m' labába\" ('I had washed'). Before plosive or affricate consonants this nasality becomes homorganic nasal of the following consonant. For ex.: \"m' bêm\" ('I came'), \"m' têm\" ('I have'), \"m' tchigâ\" ('I arrived'), \"m' crê\" ('I want').\n\nSpeakers who are strongly influenced by the Portuguese language tend to pronounce this pronoun as a nasal vowel \"úm\" instead of \"m\" .\n\nBefore some forms of the verb \"sêr\" this pronoun takes back its full form mí , in whatever variant: \"mí ê\" ('I am'), \"mí éra\" ('I was').\n\nIn this article, this pronoun is conventionally written \"m\", no matter the variant.\n\nEven though over 90% of Cape Verdean Creole words are derived from Portuguese, the grammar is very different, which makes it extremely difficult for an untrained Portuguese native speaker even to understand a basic conversation. On the other hand, the grammar shows a lot of similarities with other creoles, Portuguese-based or not (check syntactic similarities of creoles).\n\nThe basic sentence structure in Creole is SubjectVerbObject. Ex.:\n\nWhen there are two objects, the indirect object comes first while the direct object comes after, and the sentence structure becomes SubjectVerbIndirect ObjectDirect Object. Ex.:\n\nA feature that makes Cape Verdean Creole closer to other creoles is the possibility of double negation (ex.: \"Náda m' câ atchâ.\" liter. \"Nothing I didn't find.\"), or sometimes even triple negation (ex.: \"Núnca ninguêm câ tâ bába lâ.\" liter. \"Never nobody didn't go there.\"). Although double negation is common in Portuguese (e.g. \"Nunca ninguém foi lá\"), triple negation is a little bit uncommon.\n\nOnly the animated nouns (human beings and animals) have gender inflection. Ex.:\n\nIn some cases the distinction between sexes is made putting the adjectives \"mátchu\" \"male\" and \"fémia\" \"female\" after the nouns. Ex.:\n\nThe nouns in Creole have number inflection (plural marks) only when they are well determined or known in the context. Ex.:\n\nWhen the noun refers to something in general that noun does not have number inflection. Ex.:\n\nIf in a sentence there are several grammatical categories, only the first bears the plural marker. Ex.:\n\nAccording to their function, the pronouns can be subject pronouns or object pronouns. Furthermore, in each of these functions, according to the position within the sentence the pronouns can be unstressed or stressed.\n\nThe unstressed subject pronouns generally bear the function of the subject and come before the verb. Ex.:\n\nThe stressed subject pronouns bear the function of some kind of vocative and usually are separated from the verb (disjunctive pronouns). Ex.:\n\nThe object pronouns, as the name shows, bear the function of the object (direct or indirect). The unstressed object pronouns are used with the present-tense forms of verbs. Ex.:\n\nThe stressed object pronouns are used with the past-tense forms of verbs, when they are the second pronoun in a series of two pronouns, and after prepositions (prepositional pronouns). Ex.:\n\nWhen there are two object pronouns, the indirect pronoun comes first while the direct pronoun comes after, and the sentence structure becomes SubjectVerbIndirect PronounDirect Pronoun.\n\nThere are no reflexive pronouns. To indicate reflexivity, Creole uses the expression \"cabéça\" (\"head\") after the possessive determiner. Ex.:\n\nThere are no reciprocal pronouns. To indicate reciprocity, Creole uses the expression \"cumpanhêru\" (\"companion\"). Ex.:\n\nThe verbs have only minimal inflection (two forms). They have the same form for all the persons, and the notions of tense, mood and aspect are expressed through the presence (or absence) of certain morphemes (called \"verbal actualizers\" by Veiga), as in the majority of creoles.\n\nThe verbs are generally reduced to two base forms, one for the present, another for the past. The form for the present is the same as the form for the infinitive (exception: \"sêr\" \"to be\"), that in turn comes, in the majority of the verbs, from the infinitive in Portuguese but without the final \"r\". Ex.: \"cantâ\" (from Portuguese \"cantar\"), \"mexê\" (from Portuguese \"mexer\"), \"partí\" (from Portuguese \"partir\"), \"compô\" (from Portuguese \"compor\"), \"*lumbú\" (from Portuguese \"lombo\"). The form for the past is formed from the infinitive to which is joined the particle for the past \"~ba\". Ex.: \"cantába\" , \"mexêba\" , \"partíba\" , \"compôba\" , \"*lumbúba\" (in the Barlavento variants, the particle for the past \"~va\" (or \"~ba\") is joined to the imperfective actualizer, and not to the verb). It is noteworthy that the Upper Guinea creoles (Cape Verdean Creole and Guinea-Bissau Creole) put the past tense marker after the verbs, and not before like the majority of creoles (check syntactic similarities of creoles).\n\nIt is important to mention that in the Santiago variant, the stress goes back to before the last syllable in the present tense forms of the verbs. Therefore, we have: \"cánta\" instead of \"cantâ\" , \"mêxe\" or \"mêxi\" instead of \"mexê\" , \"pârti\" instead of \"partí\" , \"cômpo\" or \"cômpu\" instead of \"compô\" , \"búmbu\" instead of \"bumbú\" . In the pronominal forms, however, the stress remains on the last syllable: \"cantâ-m\" , \"mexê-bu\" , \"partí-'l\" , \"compô-nu\" , \"bumbú-'s\" .\n\nAs said before, the regular verbs are reduced to a form for the present tense and a form for the past tense, and the notions of mood and aspect are expressed through verbal actualizers.\n\nThe following table shows a paradigm of the indicative mood with the verb \"dâ\" \"to give\" in the first-person singular:\n\nThe perfective aspect of the present is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are finished, that are complete. Ex.:\n\nThe imperfective aspect of the present is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are not finished yet, that are incomplete. Ex.:\n\nThe progressive aspect of the present is used when the speech refers to present situations that are happening in a continuous, uninterrupted way. Ex.:\n\nThere is no specific form for the future. The future of the present may be expressed through three resources:\n\nThe perfective aspect of the past is used when the speech refers to past situations that were finished, or complete. Ex.:\n\nThe imperfective aspect of the past is used when the speech refers to past situations that were not finished yet, or incomplete. Ex.:\n\nThe progressive aspect of the past is used when the speech refers to past situations that were happening in a continuous and uninterrupted way. Ex.:\n\nThere is no specific form for the future. The future of the past may be expressed through three resources:\n\nThe remaining moodssubjunctive, conditional (not the same as \"conditional\" in English), eventualdo not have different aspects, only present and past tense, except the injunctive (imperative) mood which has only the present tense.\n\nThere is a group of verbs that do not follow the paradigmatic model presented above. They are the auxiliary verbs \"sêr\" \"to be\", \"stâ\" \"to be\", \"têm\" \"to have\" and \"tenê\" \"to have\", and the modal verbs \"crê\" \"to want\", \"sabê\" \"to know\", \"podê\" \"can\", \"devê\" \"must\" and \"mestê\" \"to need\".\n\nThere exist two registers for these verbs.\n\nIn the \"first register\" (in older speakers, in rural areas speakers or in speakers with little exposure to Portuguese) there are only two forms for the verbs: one for the present (\"ê\" , \"stâ\" , \"têm\" , \"tenê\" , \"crê\" , \"sabê\" , \"podê\" , \"devê\" , \"mestê\" ) and one for the past (\"éra\" , \"stába\" , \"têmba\" /tẽ, \"tenêba\" , \"crêba\" , \"sabêba\" , \"podêba\" , \"devêba\" , \"mestêba\" ). However, on the contrary of regular verbs, when the base form is used alone it represents the imperfective aspect and not the perfective aspect. Therefore, \"mí ê\", \"m' têm\", \"m' crê\", \"m' sabê\" mean \"I am, I have, I want, I know\", and not \"I've been, I've had, I've wanted, I've known\", as it would be expected. Parallelly, \"mí éra\", \"m' têmba\", \"m' crêba\", \"m' sabêba\" mean \"I was, I had, I wanted, I knew\", and not \"I had been, I had had, I had wanted, I had known\", as would be expected.\n\nIn the \"second register\" (among younger speakers, in urban areas or in speakers with more exposure to Portuguese) the system has been enriched with other forms influenced by Portuguese. Therefore, we have:\n\nThere is a parallelism between the pair of the verbs \"sêr\" / \"stâ\" \"to be\" and the pair of the verbs \"têm\" / \"tenê\" \"to have\".\n\nCape Verdean Creole has two voices. The active voice is used when the subject is explicit. The passive voice is used when the subject is indeterminate or unknown. There is also two forms for the passive. The form for the present is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle \"~du\". The form for the past is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle \"~da\". Ex.:\n\nTo negate a verb, the negative adverb \"câ\" is used after the subject and before any verbal actualizer. Ex.:\n\nIn the Santo Antão variant, the negative adverb is \"n\" . Ex.:\n\nIn imperative sentences the negative adverb \"câ\" is always in the beginning. Ex.:\n\nAnd in the Santo Antão variant:\n\nAdjectives in Creole almost always come after the noun. Only the animated nouns (human beings and animals) demand gender inflection in their adjectives. Ex.:\n\nThe adjectives for unanimated nouns have the same form as the masculine adjectives. Ex.:\n\nIn general the plural marker does not appear on adjectives since it comes in a preceding grammatical category.\n\nIn Creole there are no definite articles. If it is absolutely necessary to determine the noun, the demonstrative determiners are used instead.\n\nFor the indefinite articles there are two forms, one for the singular, another for the plural:\n\nThe possessive determiners have number inflexion, but the plural refers to the objects possessed, and not to the owners. Ex.:\n\nThe demonstrative determiners have only two degrees of proximity: close to the speaker (\"êss\" \"this, these\") and away from the speaker (\"quêl\" \"that\", \"quês\" \"those\").\n\nCreole possesses a special grammatical category for presenting or announcing something. It appears in two forms, one to present something near, (\"alí...\" ) and another to present something far (\"alâ...\" ). Ex.:\n\nIn spite of Cape Verde's small size, each island has developed its own way of speaking Creole. Each of these nine ways (there are 10 islands, one of which is uninhabited) is justifiably a different dialect, but the scholars in Cape Verde usually call them \"variants\". These variants can be classified into two branches: in the South there are the Sotavento Creoles, which comprise the Brava, Fogo, Santiago and Maio variants; in the North there are the Barlavento Creoles, which comprise the Boa Vista, Sal, São Nicolau, São Vicente and Santo Antão variants.\n\nSince some lexical forms of Cape Verdean Creole can be different according to each variant, the words and the sentences in this article will be presented in compromise model, a kind of \"middle Creole\", in order to ease the understanding and in order not to favor any variant. Whenever it will be necessary the phonemic transcription (or sometimes the phonetic transcription) will be shown immediately after the word.\n\nFor the writing system, check the section Writing system.\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view, the most important variants are the Fogo, Santiago, São Nicolau and Santo Antão ones, and any deep study of Creole should approach at least these four. They are the only islands that have received slaves directly from the African continent, that possess the most conservative linguistic features, and that are the most distinct from each other.\n\nFrom a social point of view, the most important variants are the Santiago and São Vicente ones, and any light study of Creole should approach at least these two. They are the variants of the two bigger cities (Praia and Mindelo), the variants with the greatest number of speakers, and the variants with a glottophagist tendency over the neighboring ones.\n\nThese variants have significant literature:\n\n\nThe Sotavento Creoles are spoken in the Sotavento Islands. Some characteristics:\n\nBrava Creole is spoken mainly on Brava Island. Speakers number 8,000. One of the least spoken being seventh place and one of the firsts to have written literature, in which Eugénio Tavares wrote some of his poems.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Sotavento Creoles, Brava Creole has the following:\n\nFogo Creole is spoken mainly in the Fogo of Cape Verde. It has around 50,000 speakers or nearly 5% of Cape Verdean Creole speakers including the diaspora's second language speakers. The rankings of this form of Cape Verdean Creole is fourth after Santo Antão and ahead of Sal.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Sotavento Creoles, Fogo has the following:\n\nMaio Creole is spoken mainly in the Maio Island. It numbers the entire island population which includes a small part which also speaks Portuguese.\n\nIt is one of the least spoken Cape Verdean Creole and is after Brava and ahead of Boa Vista.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Sotavento Creoles, Maio Creole has the following:\n\nSantiago Creole is spoken mainly on the Santiago Island of Cape Verde, including the capital of the country, Praia.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Sotavento Creoles, Santiago Creole has the following:\n\nThe Barlavento Creoles are spoken in the Barlavento Islands. Some characteristics:\n\nBoa Vista Creole is spoken mainly in the Boa Vista Island. Speakers number 5,000, and is the least spoken form of Creole in the language. Literature is rarely recorded but one of the speakers who was born on the island is Germano Almeida.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Barlavento Creoles, Boa Vista Creole has the following:\n\nSal Creole is spoken mainly in the island of Sal. Speakers number 15,000.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Barlavento Creoles, Sal Creole has the following:\n\nSanto Antão Creole is spoken mainly in the Santo Antão Island. It is ranked third of nine in the number of speakers and it is before Fogo and after the neighbouring São Vicente.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Barlavento Creoles, Santo Antão Creole has the following:\n\nSão Nicolau Creole is spoken mainly in the São Nicolau Island. There are 15,000 speakers, and is the fifth most spoken form of creole in the language. Literature is rarely recorded but the form of the Capeverdean Creole has been recorded in music, one of them is on caboverde.com on the page featuring this island.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Barlavento Creoles, São Nicolau Creole has the following:\n\nSão Vicente Creole is spoken mainly in the São Vicente Island. It has about 80,000 to 100,000 speakers, primarily in the São Vicente island, but also in a large segment of the Cape Verdean diaspora population. It is the second most widely spoken Cape Verdean dialect. It has produced literature from a lot of writers and musicians including Sergio Frusoni and many more.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Barlavento Creoles, São Vicente Creole has the following:\n\nFor more examples check the (in Portuguese).\n\nExcerpt of the lyrics of \"Dôci Guérra\" from Antero Simas.

Gordon was one of Famous' first directors, and he wrote and directed several \"Popeye the Sailor\" and \"Superman\" cartoons. Later, at Hanna-Barbera, Gordon worked on several cartoons featuring Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, and others.\n\nIn the late 1940s, \"funny animals\" and \"teen humor\" were two of the most popular categories in the ever-growing world of comic books. Gordon specialized in both genres and combined the two in the world's first funny-animal teen-humor title. When he created comic books, he used the pen name \"Dang\".\n\nDan Gordon began his animation career as a story man at New York's Van Beuren Studios, and by 1936 he was receiving a director's credit there. When Van Beuren went under, Gordon and many of his colleagues went to work for Paul Terry’s Terrytoons. It was here that Gordon worked with Joe Barbera (another Van Beuren alum) on \"Pink Elephants\", a cartoon that Barbera described as one of \"... the first cartoons I had a hand in actually creating from the beginning.”\n\nGordon and Barbera headed out west to MGM in 1937, but Gordon bolted back to the East shortly thereafter to help re-write the troubled \"Gulliver’s Travels\" animated feature film at Fleischer Brothers Studios. Gordon’s rewrites couldn’t save much of \"Gulliver\", but Gordon was instrumental in the success of the Fleischer Studios’ next hit: the 1941 Superman theatrical animated shorts.\n\nWhen Paramount seized control of the Fleischer studio in Miami, Gordon was one of four directors put in charge of production. Gordon stayed only a couple years at the newly dubbed Famous Studios, but the few \"Popeye\" shorts he directed are remarkable for their manic intensity. \"The Hungry Goat\", released in 1943, stands out as an attempt to bring a new, screwball character to the screen, heavily influenced by contemporary WB shorts. The fast-paced, hyper-kinetic, and over-caffeinated mayhem of those Popeye cartoons leads right into the comic book stories he crafted for The American Comics Group (ACG). Gordon was fired from Famous Studios in late 1943 or early 1944, presumably to alcohol-related problems.\n\nGordon was part of a group of animation pros led by Jim Davis (of \"Fox and Crow\" fame) that supplied original funny animal comic book stories to ACG and DC Comics. Gordon's work began appearing in \"Giggle Comics\" in 1944, and by \"Giggle\" #9, he introduced the long-running character Superkatt. Superkatt is a funny animal jab at the “long-underwear” genre of superhero comics. The title character does not have any super powers at all, but is a normal (talking) house cat that dresses in a diaper, a baby's bonnet, and a big blue bow to fight minor neighborhood injustices.\n\nIn 1949 came \"Funny Films\", a funny animal anthology title that tried to convince the reader that its stories were the filmed exploits of famous Hollywood cartoon characters.\n\nGordon's \"Puss and Boots\" was a dog-and-cat version of Tom and Jerry on crack, with unbridled cartoon violence its only delicious theme. Gordon's other \"Funny Films\" character was the comical rabbit inventor Blunderbunny. In La Salle Comics' \"Hi-Jinx\", he experimented with the hybrid idea of “teenage animal funnies”.\n\nGordon's final major character from this era is Cookie O’Toole, the teenage star of \"Cookie\" comics. Cookie began his run in 1945 when he and his whole gang (best friend/hipster Jitterbuck, heartthrob Angelpuss, sharp-dressed rival Zoot, and their egghead pal, “The Brain”) appeared fully formed in a one-shot issue of \"Topsy-Turvy Comics\". By the next year, Cookie had his own title, and began a run that lasted nine years and 55 issues.\n\nCookie is a rare example of a knock-off surpassing its inspiration. The explosive popularity of MLJ Comics’ “Archie” in the mid-1940s gave birth to an entire comics genre: the teen humor comic. While the Archie gang is clearly more iconic and enduring than Cookie and his pals ever hope to be, the Cookie comics are a much more entertaining read.\n\nGordon continued to make comics for ACG (and ACG imprints like La Salle) until he was called back into animation service by his old friend Joseph Barbera.\n\nBill Hanna and Joe Barbera had been creating the classic Tom and Jerry cartoons at MGM since 1940, but by 1957 the studio’s animation division was shut down. In a desperate bid to stay alive in the new TV era, Hanna and Barbera struck out on a foolhardy mission to make a weekly animated television series for a tiny fraction of their old Tom and Jerry budgets.\n\nGordon jumped on board to help out at Hanna-Barbera, and (with partner Charles Shows) was soon writing and drawing storyboards for most of the episodes of those earliest, foundational H-B cartoon classics: Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Pixie & Dixie, Quick Draw McGraw, and Augie Doggie. Emboldened by their early success in Saturday morning, Hanna and Barbera set their sights on producing a prime-time domestic comedy with a prehistoric twist. Gordon had some experience with cartoon cavemen, having worked on the “Stone Age” series of animated shorts for the Fleischer Brothers Studio back in 1940. Although many talented people had a part in creating what would become \"The Flintstones\", Bill Hanna generously points to Gordon. “Now you may not get the same response from anybody else, Bill Hanna recalls, ”but to me, Dan Gordon is responsible for \"The Flintstones\". He came up with the basic concept of doing it with cavemen in skins.” And Joe Barbera recounts in his autobiography that, ”the first two \"Flintstones\" were the work of Dan Gordon and myself; I controlled the content, and Dan did the storyboards.”\n\nDan Gordon continued to work for Hanna-Barbera until his death in 1970.\n\nOn August 13, 1970, exactly a month after Gordon's 68th birthday, Gordon passed away in a house fire while intoxicated. Some sources state his last known location was in Fulton County, Georgia, but the legitimacy of this information is unknown.\n\nGordon's cartoons live on through sales of DVD reissues featuring many of his \"Superman\" and \"Popeye\" cartoons, and deluxe DVD sets of \"Huckleberry Hound\" and \"The Flintstones\". Some of his work from the early Van Beuren Studios and Terrytoons days can be found on streaming video sites on the Internet. With the advent of eBay, online comic shops, and cartoon/comics blogs, today's Gordon fan has a decent chance of finding some of his comics at a reasonable cost. Well-worn back issues of \"Giggle\", \"Ha-Ha\", and \"Cookie\" comics are fairly easy to find, and many fans have been scanning and sharing these public-domain stories online.\n\n"}

HeatoN was the manager of NiP up until October 2018 when he decided to part ways with the organisation to focus on his own brand. He is widely considered one of the best \"Counter-Strike\" players of all time.\n\nThe name HeatoN comes from a brand of equipment, which is now owned by CCM, he used when he played ice hockey. Emil's first hobby was ice hockey, but he retired because of an injury. A friend (CS player fRa1L, from RevolutioN) told him to try Counter-Strike. Christensen was part of the original Ninjas in Pyjamas team of 2001 which won the Cyberathlete Professional League World Championship that year. He and the other members of Ninjas in Pyjamas went on to become the foundation to the highly successful SK Sweden, one of the most successful teams in electronic sports history. Christensen led SK Gaming to the World Cyber Games Counter-Strike championship in 2003 and to 4th place in 2004.\n\nHeatoN and NiP competed in the World Series of Video Games.\n\nChristensen was nominated for Best Counter-Strike Player of the Year in 2004, losing out to SK Gaming teammate, Tommy \"potti'\" Ingemarsson. He was selected for the Global Gaming League European Counter-Strike All-Star team in 2005.\n\nAt the beginning of 2005 he and the rest of SK Sweden chose not to renew their contracts with SK Gaming and re-formed NiP. Since then some of the NiP players moved back to SK Gaming but Christensen and others have stayed on at Ninjas in Pyjamas. NiP are now competing at professional LAN tournaments again, after a hiatus in which SpawN joined after HeatoN decided to take time off for personal reasons.\n\nChristensen, along with the other members of Ninjas in Pyjamas, assisted in the design of the SteelSound 5H (USB) Headphones produced by SteelSeries.\n\nIn December 2006 he travelled to New York and Dallas to provide support for his teammates as they competed in the World Series of Video Games (WSVG) world finals and CPL winter respectively. NiP were expected to be strong contenders in both tournaments, however bowed out uncharacteristically early.\n\nIn September 2007 HeatoN quit playing \"Counter-Strike\" to be coach of NiP but was then offered a chance to be a general manager for Stockholm in the Championship Gaming Series (CGS). HeatoN's CGS franchise was called the Stockholm Magnetik and had a \"\" team, one male and one female \"Dead or Alive 4\" player, a \"FIFA 08\" player, and two \"Forza Motorsport 2\" players.\n\nAfter the CGS's folding in late 2008 Christensen moved to promote a computer hardware company named Qpad, from his native country Sweden, for the first part of 2009. Later in the year however, he left Qpad to join with his former teammate Abdisamad \"SpawN\" Mohamed in product development at ZOWIE GEAR which is a manufacturer of competitive gaming gear, founded late 2008. In July 2010, ZOWIE GEAR announced HeatoN's first series of mice co-developed by himself called EC after player's initials. In March 2012 ZOWIE GEAR announced a new version of the EC series, named the EC eVo series which features an improved optical sensor and was released in April.\n\nIn 2012 Christensen returned to Ninjas in Pyjamas and became the organization's manager.\n\nIn September 2015 Christensen and two other formers NiP owners were charged with misleading an auditor about Ninjas in Pyjamas AB's finances during its sale to Diglife. Christensen was found guilty of fraud, and was sentenced pay a fine and perform community service.\n\nIn June 2016 HeatoN became the first person inducted into the ESL Hall of Fame.\n\nDuring the end of summer 2019 former and current players of Ninjas in Pyjamas stepped forward accusing Christensen and other leaders of the organisation of purposely withholding money from the players. According to players, the timeslot in which they were not paid was around the same time as the fraud took place 2013-2014 (sentenced 2015). The first player that stepped forward was Robin \"Fifflaren\" Johansson. Shortly there after a number of former NiP players further corroborated the allegations made by Johansson. Some of the other players among Johansson who stepped forward include Richard \"Xizt\" Landström, Adam \"friberg\" Friberg, Christopher \"GeT_RiGhT\" Alesund and Patrik \"f0rest\" Lindberg. Christensen uploaded a video to YouTube on the 22 of August 2019 where he claims that it was his companion, Niklas \"Fiskoo\" Fischier, who was responsible for players not getting their salaries, as well as a huge tax pay up that companies and organisations in Sweden pay to the Swedish tax body (Skatteverket). Fischier denied the allegations.\n\nChristensen has played professionally with the following teams:\n\n"}

{"id": "1863036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863036", "title": "Linkage (policy)", "text": "Linkage (policy)\n\nLinkage was a foreign policy that was pursued by the United States and championed by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1970s détente, during the Cold War. The policy aimed to persuade the Soviet Union to co-operate in restraining revolutions in the Third World in return for concessions in nuclear and economic fields. Despite the lack of Soviet intervention, many revolutions still occurred in Third World countries, undermining the policy.\nThe premise behind linkage, as a policy, was to connect political and military issues. This established a relationship making progress in area \"A\" dependent on progress in area \"B.\"\n\nAn important aspect of the policy was that deviations from respecting the rights and interests would go punished. The intent of the action was to bring home to the offending state the limitations of acceptable international behaviour and demonstrate that attempts at expansion (and upsetting international stability) would go punished. This meant that conflict itself would contribute to stabilising the international order.\n\nThe Nixon-Kissinger approach did not link foreign and domestic areas.\n\nSelective relaxation of tensions is an opposing policy to linkage. In that case, an issue of arms control could be addressed and tension diminished, with the status quo being maintained in other strategic areas.\n\nThere have been different uses of the term ‘linkage’ in reference to both domestic and international policy making. There is often debate over the true meaning of the term. Historians and academics have portrayed the meaning of ‘linkage’ in different lights. Common understandings of the term are that linkage means leverage – the linking of one event to another in order to maintain bargaining power or pressure on the opposing party involved. Another description of linkage comes from Marvin Kalb and Bernard Kalb. They describe linkage as “an up-to-date application of [Henry] Kissinger’s theories about balance of power.” Specific types of linkages can be coercive or cooperative. They can also be prospective, such as promises or threats, and they can be retrospective, such as rewards or retaliation.\n\nSince the 1970s, the term has been used to make reference to the influence and manipulation of US-Soviet and East-West connections. An example of coercive linkage policy would be the US seeking to tie arms control progress to what they thought was acceptable behaviour in the Third World. This was based on the assumption that the Soviet Union wanted arms control more than the US did.\n\nThere are multiple theories behind linkage politics. The basic differences behind these theories are that the parties involved are either different or similar – with respect to their issue positions.\n\nFor those parties that are different, the politics of linkage are based on the assumption that governments or parties involved make decisions as trade-offs. Linkage is \"established by the players’ beliefs that cooperative behaviour in one setting influences the prospects for cooperation in other settings.\" By connecting events or issues that are not necessarily connected in a particular way, governments can boost their political and economic situations by surrendering less important issues for those that have a greater, all-round importance.\n\nFor those parties that are similar, linkage politics are based on the observation that mutually beneficial exchange is more prevalent between similar countries. One country would link positive incentives (such as technology transfers and arms control) to the expectation of the other country’s cooperation requital. With similar issues, it becomes more about bargaining power and convincing the other country involved that they are receiving something worthwhile in return.\n\nLinkage policy became significant during the time of détente during the Cold War. This meant a relaxing of tensions, mainly between the East and the West. By 1971, the newly established Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was ready to accept US ideas about relaxing tensions. This was for a number of reasons. The Soviet Union had issues with the Czechoslovakian Communist party in 1968 when their leader, Alexander Dubček, created reforms encouraging free speech and democracy. This began a wave of demonstrations that promoted liberalisation, called the Prague Spring. On August 20, the USSR invaded Czechoslovakia to undo the reforms taking place. This created the Brezhnev Doctrine, which gave the Soviet Union its own right to intervene against counterrevolutionary behaviour. Fearing that this might apply to them, China provoked and engaged in conflict with the Soviets. Such conflicts forced the Soviets to scale back aggressiveness and \"repair [their] image in the wake of the Prague Spring.\" The fear of having poor relations with both the US and China was an incentive for the Soviets to seek detente. Other incentives included the need for agricultural imports and access to better Western technology.\n\nThe US and Soviet Union saw detente differently. The US saw detente as an encouragement of changes in Soviet Union domestic and foreign policy. The Soviets saw detente as influencing only foreign policy, not domestic issues. What they did have in common was a shared interest in avoiding a nuclear war. They were also in agreement that East-West competition would continue during this period of relaxed tensions. The problem arose when they was a lack of clarity in terms of how detente would affect Third World involvement. The US mainly had issues with Soviet foreign policy in these areas. Henry Kissinger (US Secretary of State at the time) believed there were areas of congruent interests which would help to regulate competition between the US and the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring the Presidencies of both Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, linkage diplomacy was used as a key foreign policy measure. It was particularly aimed at the Soviet Union. Henry Kissinger, who was Nixon’s National Security Advisor, said that the aim of this policy was to \"free [American] foreign policy from oscillations between overextension and isolation and to ground it in a firm conception of the national interest.\"\n\nFollowing the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) agreement in 1972, both the US and the Soviet Union agreed to practise mutual restraint. The terms of the agreement were vague. This meant that Nixon and Kissinger interpreted it as a justification of their own actions. As a result of this, part of this administrations perception of linkage was to convince Soviet leaders that they would have motivation for moderation, and also punishment for a contradiction of the previous agreements they had signed.\n\nNixon and Kissinger also wanted to tie linkage to trade. As trade ties between the US and the Soviet Union increased, Kissinger aimed to convert these connections into political advantages. They wanted to make economic cooperation contingent on the evidence of progress in US foreign policy matters. If the Soviet Union made exceptions to issues they had with US foreign policy, the United States would grant them the most favoured nation (MFN) status. This administration aimed to use the growing economic relationship with the USSR as a “carrot for Soviet political behaviour.”\n\nCongressional intervention made it difficult for Nixon and Kissinger to implement linkage policy in the way they wanted to. The trade agreement that Nixon and Kissinger established was amended in 1974 under the Jackson-Vanik amendment. This linked the granting of the MFN status, instead, with increased Jewish emigration from the USSR. Such terms were found to be humiliating and unacceptable on the part of the Soviet Union. This made it difficult to finalise the agreement. Raymond Garthoff (US treaty adviser and former US ambassador to Bulgaria) said that the intervention by Congress spoiled Soviet expectations of economic benefits that had been promised by the Nixon government by making them dependent on Soviet internal affairs. Kissinger objected the intervention from Congress as he believed foreign issues are better resolved quietly than publicly in Congress. The success of quiet diplomacy can be seen in the following fact: in 1968 only 400 Jews were allowed to emigrate, but in 1973, nearly 35,000 were allowed to emigrate.\n\nNixon and Kissinger were secretive in their policymaking. This was because they were suspicious of the bureaucracy. Decisions were made without the knowledge of William Rogers, who was the secretary of State at the time and responsible for the management of US diplomacy. Congress also grew suspicious and played a role in foreign policy as well. This secrecy and conflicting ideas made it difficult to gain concessions and make progress in foreign policy.\n\nWhile Nixon had the idea of championing Linkage policy during his time as president, Carter did not believe that linkage policy was the answer to cooling Soviet tensions early on in his presidency. He believed that the majority of his country’s international concerns stemmed from the confrontational relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. This view was backed by the US Secretary of state Cyrus Vance. Carter also had no desire to engage in issues related to Soviet engagement in the Third World. Carter’s National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, held a different view. He supported the employment of linkage diplomacy. Brzezinski believed that the correct answer to Soviet actions in the Third World was a \"carefully calibrated policy of simultaneous competition and cooperation of its own, designed to promote a more comprehensive and more reciprocal détente.\"\n\nIn 1978 Brzezinski strove to link developments in the SALT II negotiations to revised Soviet behaviour in Africa. The Ogaden War took place in 1977-78 between Ethiopia and Somalia. The US was allied to Ethiopia, and the Soviet Union was allied to Somalia. The Soviets had recently started constructing a military presence in Ethiopia, despite the US’ previously established relationship. After efforts of mediation from the Soviet Union failed, Somalia cut all ties and its friendship treaty with the USSR in 1977. The Soviet Union increased its presence by sending 10,000 soldiers into the country by early 1978. Soviet involvement in this conflict created a setback in the US attempts to deal with instability in the third world, especially Africa. Following this, Brzezinski called for the delay of SALT II negotiations in retaliation. This would continue until the USSR complied with what the US perceived as acceptable conduct in the Third World. \n\nVance tried to dampen the usage of linkage diplomacy. He suggested that a more suitable approach would be to accept that the US and the Soviet Union have competition, but not link Third World behaviour with important issues such as the SALT agreements. President Carter did not reject this, but said that the abuse of human rights and involvement in Africa would make it difficult to ratify the SALT agreement.\n\nIn December 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan. The intervention was considered a “blatant violation of accepted international rules of behaviour” by Carter. Another concern was the fall of the Shah in Iran in early 1979, and the perceived inability of the Carter administration to free the American hostages held there. This largely affected US policy and according to Brzezinski, led to the demise of detente.\n\nCarter’s national security advisor, Brzezinski, believed that the Soviet’s found a sense of confidence and were emboldened by the US failure to react strongly to the USSR intervention of the Horn in 1978. He mentioned that this allowed them to be more aggressive in their foreign policy without the risk of US punishment. He believed linkage policy should have been developed and used more consistently throughout Carter’s term as president. If this happened, the Soviet’s would have been less adventurous in their exploration of the Third World, and the SALT negotiations could have been saved. Following this, the US imposed sanctions on the Soviet Union including a grain embargo and a ban on the transfer of technology.\n\nThere are multiple arguments as to whether linkage diplomacy had achieved its objectives by the end of the Cold War. Samuel Makinda states three reasons against the success of linkage policy. These include conceptual problems, unsolicited interference in Soviet internal affairs, and Soviet intervention due to American disenchantment.\n\nThe Basic Principles agreement was the basis on which Linkage policy was first imposed. The agreement was vague and not very specific. This meant that each country interpreted the agreement in their own way. This was the conceptual problem. For example, the US wanted ‘unilateral advantage’ in the Middle East but did not involve the Soviet Union in the Egyptian-Israeli peace process. But when the Soviets wanted ‘unilateral advantage’ in Africa, the US wanted to punish them.\n\nThe US wanted to link their own issues with Soviet domestic policies. The SALT I agreement between the US and the Soviet Union in 1972 and the Basic Principles Agreement did not involve issues related to domestic policies. When the US did attempt to affect domestic policy in the Soviet Union, the Soviet leaders regarded it as interfering in their internal affairs in an attempt to undermine their leadership.\n\nThe US had disenchanted some countries in its attempt to deal with Soviet aggressiveness and expansion. For example, Ethiopia became disenchanted after developments in the Ogaden War. Angola also became disenchanted because they could not get US support due to their ideological inclinations. This meant that Soviet intervention in Africa was partly because these disenchanted countries invited them.\n\n\n"}

He soon went to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions, where he teamed up with Ron Garvin as a fan favorite. He had a short term in World Class Championship Wrestling as a villain named Tonga John.\n\nSeeing the monster villain potential in a huge, intimidating man with surprising agility, \nnow back in Crockett's territory Jim Crockett, Jr. changed Vailahi into Konga the Barbarian. He debuted in JCP on 29 December 1984 episode of \"WorldWide\" after a match between Assassin #1 and Kareem Mohammad as a member of Paul Jones' Army. He defeated Sam Houston in his first match later in the night. Vailahi was brought into the company to aid Jones in his rivalry with Jimmy Valiant. He was paired with Superstar Billy Graham under the management of Jones. At the inaugural The Great American Bash, Barbarian teamed with Graham and Abdullah the Butcher in a loss to Sam Houston, Manny Fernandez and Buzz Tyler in a six-man tag team match. Following the event, Barbarian occasionally teamed with Abdullah and turned on Graham by the end of the year. Barbarian lost to Graham in an arm wrestling contest and then in a singles match at Starrcade. At the \"NWA/AWA Star Wars\", Vailahi lost to Capitol Sports Promotions star Carlos Colón.\n\nVailahi frequently teamed with Black Bart, Shaska Whatley, Teijho Khan, as well as Baron Von Raschke throughout 1986. Vailahi teamed with Raschke to participate in the 1986 Crockett Cup, losing to Jimmy Valiant and Manny Fernandez in the opening round. It was during this time that \"Konga\" was dropped from his name and he became simply The Barbarian. Raschke left Jones' team and became a rival of the group. At Starrcade, Whatley and Barbarian lost to Hector Guerrero and Raschke in a tag team match.\n\nVailahi entered the 1987 Crockett Cup with Bill Dundee, beating Tim Horner and Mike Rotunda in the opening round and lost to The Super Powers (Dusty Rhodes and Nikita Koloff) in the second round. Vailahi teamed with the likes of Manny Fernandez and Vladimir Petrov throughout 1987. In 1987, he appeared in the movie \"Body Slam\", as Axe, of the tag team called The Cannibals. In late 1987, he formed a team with Ivan Koloff, who was also his coach. During this time, he formed The Powers of Pain with The Warlord and the team began feuding heavily with another team of big men, The Road Warriors (Animal and Hawk). Vailahi made his pay-per-view debut at the Bunkhouse Stampede Finals pay-per-view on 24 January 1988, as a participant in a Steel cage Bunkhouse Stampede. He was the runner-up, being eliminated by Dusty Rhodes. They injured Animal's eye in storyline during a weightlifting contest and soon after teamed with Ivan Koloff to beat Rhodes and Road Warriors to win the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship at a live event on 12 February. Koloff and Powers of Pain would lose to Rhodes and Road Warriors in a barbed wire match at \"Clash of the Champions I\" on 27 March. The following month, Powers of Pain entered the 1988 Crockett Cup, defeating Mark Starr and Chris Champion in the second round and Road Warriors in the quarter-final and lost to eventual winners Lex Luger and Sting in the semi-final.\n\nIn April 1988, Crockett decided he wanted the feuding tag teams to have a series of scaffold matches, which neither team wanted because they felt that they were too large to safely participate. This was especially so for the Powers of Pain, who were scheduled to lose the matches by falling off the scaffolding. Barbarian and Warlord decided to leave the company. The NWA announcers explained that the Road Warriors had run them off, even though they still held the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship.\n\nUpon their arrival in WWF, the Powers of Pain were fan favorites, initially managed by Tito Santana, They feuded with WWF World Tag Team Champions Demolition who had defeated Strike Force (Santana and Rick Martel) for the titles and then injured Martel (kayfabe). The Powers were introduced as mercenaries to help Martel and Santana gain revenge on Demolition for both the title loss and the injury to Martel. They made their debut at a live event on 18 June 1988 as a replacement for Strike Force where they beat Demolition by count-out. They made their televised debut on 16 July episode of \"Superstars\" where they defeated enhancement talents Iron Mike Sharpe and Tony Ulysses. The Powers had their first rivalry against The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov). They defeated Bolsheviks in their pay-per-view debut at the inaugural SummerSlam, where they introduced their new manager The Baron. At the Survivor Series, The Powers led a team of fan favorite tag teams against Demolition's team of villainous tag teams in a Survivor Series match, during which a double turn took place when Demolition's manager Mr. Fuji turned on Demolition by causing them to get eliminated by count-out. The Powers afterwards came to Fuji's aid and thus became villains and Demolition became fan favorites. The Powers of Pain then eliminated Los Conquistadores to win the match. On 12 December episode of \"Prime Time Wrestling\", Fuji was confirmed as the new manager of The Powers of Pain.\n\nBarbarian entered the Royal Rumble match at the 1989 Royal Rumble pay-per-view as the number 26 entrant. He and Ted DiBiase eliminated Brutus Beefcake and Hercules, before Barbarian was eliminated by Rick Martel. On 20 February episode of \"Prime Time Wrestling\", Powers of Pain received their first opportunity for the Tag Team Championship against Demolition, which they lost via disqualification. At WrestleMania V, Powers of Pain and Mr. Fuji competed against Demolition for the title in a handicap match, where Demolition retained the title by pinning Fuji. At Survivor Series, Powers of Pain and Demolition were on opposing teams as Powers of Pain were paired with Ted DiBiase and Zeus in the Million $ Team against Hulk Hogan's Hulkamaniacs (Demolition and Jake Roberts). Powers of Pain eliminated both members of Demolition before being disqualified for double teaming Hogan. Hulkamaniacs won the match. After coming up short in their title hunt, Powers of Pain feuded with tag teams such as The Hart Foundation, The Bushwhackers and The Rockers.\n\nBarbarian participated in the 1990 Royal Rumble match as the number 28 entrant. He was eliminated by Hercules. Powers of Pain faced Demolition for the last time in a tag team match on 10 February episode of \"Superstars\", which Demolition won by disqualification. Powers of Pain's last televised match as a team was on 19 February televised special on the MSG Network, where they teamed with Mr. Fuji against Jim Duggan and The Rockers in a match, which they lost. On 3 March episode of \"Superstars\", it was announced that Barbarian would face Tito Santana at WrestleMania VI. The following week on \"Superstars\", it was announced that Fuji had sold the contracts of Powers of Pain, thus splitting up the team. Powers of Pain had their last match as a team on 25 March, where they lost to Hulk Hogan and The Big Boss Man.\n\nOn 24 March episode of \"Superstars\", Bobby Heenan became the manager of Barbarian. As a member of Heenan's faction, Barbarian's image was tweaked: he grew out his Road Warrior-like mohawk and face paint, instead wearing a fur cloak, a helmet with reindeer-like antlers, and a skull to the ring. He briefly wrestled in singles competition, defeating Tito Santana at WrestleMania VI. He was a member of Natural Disasters (Earthquake, Dino Bravo and Haku) against The Hulkamaniacs (Hulk Hogan, Big Boss Man, Tugboat and Jim Duggan) at Survivor Series. Hulkamaniacs won.\n\nOn 22 December episode of \"Superstars\", it was announced that Barbarian would face Heenan Family's rival The Big Boss Man in a match at the 1991 Royal Rumble, which Barbarian lost. He would also lose a subsequent rematch to Boss Man on 18 February episode of \"Prime Time Wrestling\". Barbarian was paired with Heenan Family member Haku in a tag team on 23 February episode of \"Superstars\", where it was announced that the duo would face The Rockers at WrestleMania VII. Their first match as a team was on 9 March episode of \"Superstars\", where they defeated enhancement talents. Barbarian and Haku lost the match to Rockers at WrestleMania VII. Later in the event, Haku and Barbarian helped Mr. Perfect retain the Intercontinental Championship against Big Boss Man. Barbarian was utilized as a mid-carder throughout the year.\n\nDuring this time, Barbarian had only one major match, a loss to The British Bulldog at Battle Royal at the Albert Hall. Immediately after the match, Barbarian participated in a battle royal, in which he was eliminated by Tito Santana. On 1 December episode of \"Wrestling Challenge\", it was announced that Barbarian would challenge Bret Hart for the Intercontinental Championship at This Tuesday in Texas but no-showed the event and was replaced by Skinner. On 18 January 1992, Barbarian reunited with his Powers of Pain tag team partner The Warlord in a loss to New Foundation (Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart). Barbarian participated in the 1992 Royal Rumble match for the vacant WWF Championship as the number eight entrant. He was eliminated by Hercules. He left the WWF in February 1992 and returned to JCP, which had become World Championship Wrestling (WCW).\n\nBarbarian made his televised debut in WCW as a villain on 4 July episode of \"Saturday Night\", where he defeated Steve Pritchard. On 12 July episode of \"Main Event\", Barbarian and Dick Slater were booked to defeat The Fabulous Freebirds (Jimmy Garvin and Michael Hayes) for the United States Tag Team Championship. However, this was the last match for this title as the title was retired a month later. Barbarian was heavily pushed throughout the summer with a winning streak against the likes of Brian Pillman, Tom Zenk, Marcus Alexander Bagwell and Barry Windham. He was placed in an alliance with Tony Atlas, Cactus Jack, Jake Roberts and Butch Reed. Their main rival was Ron Simmons, whom Barbarian unsuccessfully challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship at the Halloween Havoc pay-per-view. Barbarian entered the King of Cable Tournament, losing to Dustin Rhodes in the quarter-final on 14 November episode of \"Saturday Night\". On 18 November \"Clash of the Champions XXI\", Barbarian, Cactus Jack and Tony Atlas lost to Simmons and his debuting partner 2 Cold Scorpio in a handicap match. Barbarian appeared at the company's premier pay-per-view Starrcade on 29 December, where he was randomly paired with Kensuke Sasaki against Big Van Vader and Dustin Rhodes in a Lethal Lottery qualifying match, which the latter duo won.\n\nOn 13 January 1993 \"Clash of the Champions XXII\", Barbarian was supposed to team with Vader, Paul Orndorff and Barry Windham against Sting, Dustin Rhodes and Ron Simmons in a Thundercage match but Barbarian was kicked out of his team by Harley Race for siding with Cactus Jack. As a result, Barbarian turned into a heroic character. On 17 January episode of \"Main Event\", Barbarian and Jack faced Vader and Orndorff in a match, which ended in a double disqualification. The two teams faced off in a no disqualification match on 23 January episode of \"Power Hour\" which Vader and Orndorff won. On 30 January episode of \"Saturday Night\", Barbarian lost to Orndorff in singles competition. Barbarian received a title match against Vader for the World Heavyweight Championship on 7 February episode of \"Main Event\", where Vader retained the title. Barbarian made his last televised appearance on 7 March episode of \"Main Event\", where he lost to Steve Regal in the first round match of a tournament for the vacant World Television Championship. He would compete on the house show circuit for the next few months and departed the company in June.\n\nOn 6 June 1994, Barbarian returned to the WWF at a house show to face Razor Ramon as a substitute for Diesel. He would wrestle numerous matches on house shows against the likes of Lex Luger, Tatanka and Typhoon for the next two months. On 1 September, Barbarian replaced an injured Samu and teamed with Fatu against Two Dudes with Attitudes (Shawn Michaels and Diesel) for the Tag Team Championship, just a few days after Michaels and Diesel had beaten The Headshrinkers (Fatu and Samu) for the titles. Later that month, he permanently replaced Samu and was renamed Seone, one half of the new version of The Headshrinkers with Fatu after Samu left the WWF. On 10 October episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", Vailahi made his televised return to WWF. The new combination made only one pay-per-view appearance as a team which was at the Survivor Series event as part of The Bad Guys (Razor Ramon, 1-2-3 Kid and The British Bulldog) against The Teamsters (Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart). New Headshrinkers were quickly eliminated but their team won the match after Michaels and Diesel broke up as a team. This resulted in Michaels vacating the Tag Team Championship and a tournament was set up to crown the new champions. New Headshrinkers participated in the tournament, beating Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart by disqualification in the quarter-final round on 31 December episode of \"Superstars\", before losing to Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka in the semi-final round on 14 January 1995 episode of \"Superstars\". Seone participated in the 1995 Royal Rumble match as the number six entrant. He eliminated Kwang and Rick Martel and then he and Eli Blu eliminated each other. This sparked a feud between New Headshrinkers and The Blu Brothers (Jacob and Eli), in which New Headshrinkers came up short. New Headshrinkers received an opportunity for the Tag Team Championship against Owen Hart and Yokozuna on 6 May episode of \"Superstars\", but lost the match. By July, the Headshrinkers dissolved, as Vailahi left the WWF for WCW.\n\nWhile WWE currently references Vailahi as Sione on their website, the character's name was actually spelt Seone on television and in WWF Magazine during his 1994-1995 run. \nIn late 1995, Vailahi returned to WCW, wearing a mask and teaming with his former Powers of Pain tag team partner, The Warlord. They were known as the masked \"Super Assassins\", managed by Col. Robert Parker. Super Assassins made their televised debut on 27 November episode of \"Prime\", with a win over The American Males. No mention was ever made on television of their former identities, and the team did not last long as Warlord left WCW in early 1996.\n\nLater on, he was added into Kevin Sullivan's Dungeon of Doom and was paired with Dungeon teammate Haku (now known as Meng) in a tag team called Faces of Fear on 29 January episode of \"Monday Nitro\", where they lost to the returning Road Warriors. Faces of Fear were part of Alliance to End Hulkamania against Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage in a Doomsday Cage match at Uncensored, which Hogan and Savage won. At the Slamboree pay-per-view, Barbarian was randomly paired with Diamond Dallas Page in a Lethal Lottery match, where they defeated Meng and Hugh Morrus in the first match and then Rick Steiner and The Booty Man in the second match to qualify for the Lord of the Ring battle royal, in which Vailahi was the runner-up, being eliminated by Page.\n\nDungeon of Doom were entered into a rivalry with Four Horsemen, stemming from The Taskmaster's rivalry with Horsemen member Chris Benoit over Woman. At the Halloween Havoc pay-per-view, Faces of Fear lost to Horsemen members Benoit and Steve McMichael in a tag team match. Faces of Fear began pursuing the World Tag Team Championship as they faced The Outsiders (Scott Hall and Kevin Nash) and Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags) in a triangle match for the title at World War 3, where Outsiders retained the title. Faces of Fear received another title match against Outsiders at Starrcade but failed to win the title.\n\nFaces of Fear competed in the tag team division throughout 1997 and failed to get any championship success. Dungeon of Doom disbanded after Taskmaster's retirement. Faces of Fear would then feud with Wrath and Mortis, whom they faced in a losing effort at Fall Brawl. On 29 September episode of \"Monday Nitro\", Barbarian lost to newcomer Goldberg, becoming one of the earliest victims of his undefeated streak. Faces of Fear had their next rivalry against Glacier and Ernest Miller, whom they defeated at World War 3. On 12 February 1998 episode of \"Thunder\", Barbarian tried to separate Meng from Hugh Morrus after Meng defeated Morrus and refused to release the \"Tongan Death Grip\". Meng then applied the hold on Barbarian as well, thus breaking up Faces of Fear. Barbarian formed a tag team with Morrus under the management of Jimmy Hart and feuded with Meng throughout the year. The former partners competed in the opening match of the Road Wild pay-per-view, where Meng defeated Barbarian.\n\nJimmy Hart reunited Faces of Fear in early 1999 and put them in a tournament for the vacated World Tag Team Championship. Barbarian turned on Meng during a tournament match against Bobby Duncum, Jr. and Mike Enos on 12 February episode of \"Thunder\" by striking Meng with the \"Kick of Fear\". Barbarian continued his rivalry with Meng throughout the year. He was then placed in Jimmy Hart's The First Family faction with, Hugh Morrus, Brian Knobbs and Jerry Flynn. The stable dissolved after only two months. Barbarian's last televised match in WCW was on 27 March 2000 episode of \"Thunder\", a loss to the World Television Champion Jim Duggan. WCW terminated Barbarian's contract in April 2000 in an effort of lowering budget costs.\n\nIn March 2004, The Barbarian won the NWA Virginia Heavyweight Championship, and feuded with David Flair for the title, until he was ruled ineligible to compete due to a lack of a valid Virginia wrestling license. In 2005, The Barbarian again teamed with The Warlord in Gladiator Championship Wrestling, and renewed his feud with Road Warrior Animal. In 2007, at the Annual Championship Wrestling/IRW Fun Fest Slam in Kingsport, Tennessee, The Barbarian wrestled 'Big' Steve Fury, the CW Heavyweight Champion, in front of 1,100 people. He also made an appearance in IWA Mid South, at the April Bloodshowers 2007 event, where he wrestled Jimmy Jacobs. In 2008, The Barbarian teamed with Demolition Ax (Bill Eadie), and managed by Ted DiBiase, in Seagrove North Carolina, defeating Cowboy Willie Watts and Leroy Greene. In 2009, The Barbarian teamed with the Iron Chief in the Ivan Koloff's tag team tournament in the Allied Independent Wrestling Federation (AIWF). In August 2012, Chikara announced that The Barbarian would be making his debut for the promotion in the following month's 2012 King of Trios tournament, where he will reunite with The Warlord and Meng as The Faces of Pain in reference to their previous team names Faces of Fear and Powers of Pain. On 14 September, the team was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by Team ROH (Mike Bennett, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Two days later, on the final day of the tournament, The Barbarian and The Warlord took part in a tag team gauntlet match, from which they eliminated their old WWF rivals, Demolition, before being eliminated themselves by 1-2-3 Kid and Marty Jannetty.\n\nSione has seven children with his wife, Seini Tonga. His youngest son, Peter, is a college football player, who signed with Brigham Young University in February 2005.

The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. In September 2018, the lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1863087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863087", "title": "Libertarian science fiction", "text": "Libertarian science fiction\n\nLibertarian science fiction is a subgenre of science fiction that focuses on the politics and social order implied by right libertarian philosophies with an emphasis on individualism and private ownership of the means of production—and in some cases, no state whatsoever.\n\nAs a category, libertarian fiction is unusual because the vast majority of its authors are self-identified as science fiction authors. This contrasts with the authors of much other social criticism who are largely academic or mainstream novelists who tend to dismiss any genre classification. The identification between libertarianism and science fiction is so strong that the U.S. Libertarian Party often has representatives at science fiction conventions and one of the highest profile authors currently in the subgenre of libertarian science fiction, L. Neil Smith, was the Arizona Libertarian Party's 2000 candidate for the President of the United States.\n\nAs a genre, it can be seen as growing out of the 1930s and 1940s when the science-fiction pulp magazines were reaching their peak at the same time as fascism and communism. While this environment gave rise to dystopian novels, in the pulps, this influence more often give rise to speculations about societies (or sub-groups) arising in direct opposition to \"totalitarianism\".\n\nAyn Rand's novel \"Atlas Shrugged\" is a strong (perhaps the strongest) influence with an anti-socialist attitude and an individualist ethic that echoes throughout the genre.\nOf more direct relevance to the science fiction end of this genre is Robert A. Heinlein's \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\", which is highly regarded even by non-libertarian science fiction readers. An award for libertarian science fiction, the Prometheus Award, is given out every year. Some winners of the award identify as libertarians (e.g., L. Neil Smith, Victor Koman, Brad Linaweaver), while others do not (Terry Pratchett, Charles Stross).\n\nSome other prominent libertarian science fiction authors include S. Andrew Swann and Michael Z. Williamson.\n\n\n\n"}

The airport serves as the main hub for Air Malta and Medavia besides being a base for Ryanair and its subsidiary Malta Air. It is also home to the Area Control Center and hosted the annual Malta Airshow until 2017. The airport is operated by Malta International Airport plc.\n\nThe first civil airfield was constructed at Ta' Qali, followed by others at Ħal Far (RAF Hal Far) and Luqa. During the Second World War, the airfields at Ta' Qali and Hal Far were severely battered and civil operations subsequently centred on Luqa Airport. \n\nThe increase in passenger handling and aircraft movements necessitated the construction of a civil air terminal. Preparations started in 1956 and the British Government mainly financed what was then a Lm 300,000 project. Malta's new passenger air terminal at Luqa was inaugurated on 31 March 1958 by the then Governor of Malta Sir Robert Laycock. The air terminal consisted of two floors including some basic facilities such as a restaurant, a post office, a cable and wireless office and a viewing balcony for the public. \n\nIn October 1977, a new and longer runway was launched and works commenced on the extension and refurbishment of the air terminal. An arrivals lounge and another lounge dedicated to VIPs were added and the original part of the terminal building was used for departures.\n\nThis refurbishment was not enough as it still lacked certain essential facilities. Immediately after a change in Government in 1987, the new administration decided that the 35-year-old terminal was past its time (Luqa Terminal) and therefore gave the green light for the construction of a new air terminal along Park 9 (Now located in Gudja). \n\nUntil the construction of the new air terminal was completed, the Government embarked on a further upgrade of the old air terminal. The facilities introduced included air conditioning, new baggage carousels, flight information monitors, computerised check-in desks, a new floor surface and new retail outlets including a larger duty-free area.\n\nThe foundation stone of the present air terminal in Gudja was laid in September 1989 and it was inaugurated in record time 29 months later, in February 1992. Malta International Airport became fully operational on 25 March 1992 and the old Luqa passenger terminal was effectively closed down after 35 years.\n\nOver the last several years, passenger numbers have been increasing, climbing from 3.5 million in 2011 to 6.0 million in 2017. The increase in passenger numbers is mainly due to the increased number of routes served by low-cost carriers. Ryanair based one aircraft in Malta from May 2010, increasing to two in May 2012, three in March 2016, four in March 2017, five in March 2018 and further to six in April 2019. The largest aircraft visiting Malta International Airport regularly is the daily Emirates Boeing 777-300. The airport has received occasional visits by the Airbus A380, usually for repainting at one of the local maintenance facilities.\n\nThe airport has a single passenger terminal which became fully operational on 25 March 1992. This replaced the old Luqa terminal which is by 2020 mostly used for cargo. Malta International Airport air terminal operations include general passenger services, and the operation of an extensive range of retail services at the airport, airside and landside shops, restaurants and other outlets, which are all operated on concession agreements. The airport offers one VIP lounge, the La Valette Club. The airport also hosts several maintenance facilities including those operated by Lufthansa Technik and SR Technics.\n\nThe head office of Medavia is on the airport property.\n\nLocated within the grounds of Malta International Airport, the Business Centre is the first building in Malta to have applied for BREEAM (BRE Environmental Assessment Method) to become the island's first Grade A office park. The head office of Air Malta is at Level 2 of the Skyparks Business Centre.\n\nThe Malta Airport MetOffice is part of the Malta International Airport and provides the function of a national meteorological service for Malta. Although they primarily serve aviation they also service the public sector. All equipment, other than the Doppler Weather Radar, is enhanced by automatic weather stations, of which eight are situated in Malta and Gozo. At the same time an aerodrome weather observation system is located at the airport. The MetOffice is able to get information from the Agencia Estatal de Meteorología in Madrid and the UK's Met Office along with numerical weather models such as those provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, England.\n\nThe Air Wing of the Armed Forces of Malta is based at Malta International Airport. The Air Wing terminal consists of six hangars. The Air Wing operates a total of 8 fixed-wing aircraft and 6 helicopters as well as manning a pair of Italian Air Force helicopters used for search-and-rescue.\n\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Malta:\n\nMalta International Airport is served also by several buses operated by private transportation groups and public transport operated by Malta Public Transport.\nMalta Public Transport buses serve the airport. A mixture of Express and local services are available.\n\nThe airport is located southwest of the capital, Valletta.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1863118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863118", "title": "Chatichai Choonhavan", "text": "Chatichai Choonhavan\n\nChatichai Choonhavan (, , ; 5 April 1920 – 6 May 1998) was a Thai army officer, diplomat and politician. From 1986 to 1991, he was the chairman of the Thai Nation Party and served as the Prime Minister of Thailand from August 1988 until the coup d'état of February 1991.\n\nChatichai was the only son of Field Marshal Phin Choonhavan and \"Khunying\" Wibunlak Choonhavan. He was of Thai Chinese descent with ancestry from Chenghai District of Shantou City, Guangdong Province, China. His father was the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army from 1948 to 1954 and exerted a strong influence on the country's politics and economy. Chatichai had four sisters. The eldest was married to General Phao Siyanon, who was one of Thailand's strongmen during the 1950s. Another sister married Pramarn Adireksarn, who later became Chatichai's political ally. Chatichai married Boonruen Sopoj, a relative and confidante of Princess Mother Srinagarindrathe mother of kings Ananda Mahidol and Bhumibol Adulyadej.\n\nChatichai and Boonruen had two children, daughter Wanee Hongpraphas, and their son political scientist, social activist, and former senator Kraisak Choonhavan.\n\nThe former deputy prime minister Korn Dapparansi is his nephew.\n\nChatichai studied at Debsirin School, a long-standing, prestigious, all-boys school in Bangkok, and at the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy. He entered active military service as second lieutenant and cavalry platoon leader in 1940. During World War II, he was assigned to the Phayap Army (\"Northwest Army\"), under the command of his father Phin, and participated in the invasion of the Shan States of Burma. After the war, he continued his training at the Thai Army Cavalry School and the United States Army Armor School in Fort Knox, Kentucky. In 1949, he was appointed military attaché in Washington, DC. At the age of 31, Chatichai was a major-general.\n\nIn 1951, the military, led by Chatichai's father and his brother-in-law, Phao Siyanon, effectively assumed power in Thailand in a \"silent coup\". They used their political influence to extend their activities to the economic sphere. Chatichai served in the Korean War as the commander of the 1st Cavalry Battalion. Then, he became director and commander of the Thai Army Armor School. In 1957, Field Marshal Sarit Thanarata rival of Chatichai's father and brother-in-lawstaged a coup d'état against the government of Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram. He ousted the Phin-Phao clique and filled the important political and military posts with his own followers. The new regime accused the Choonhavan clan (also known as the \"Soi Rajakru clan\", after the family's residence) of having embezzled millions of dollars of public funds and hiding them in Swiss bank accounts. This ended Chatichai's military career.\n\nChatichai was transferred to the diplomatic service and assigned to the relatively unimportant post of ambassador to Argentina. During the following years he consecutively served as the Thai ambassador to Austria, Switzerland, Turkey, Yugoslavia, the Holy See and the United Nations. In 1972, he returned to Bangkok to become the director of the Foreign Ministry's political department.\n\nIn the government of Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn, Chatichai was appointed deputy minister of foreign affairs in 1972. During the hostage-taking in the Israeli embassy by a terrorist commando of the Palestinian Black September organisation in December 1972, he and the Agriculture Minister Dawee Chullasapya negotiated with the terrorists. In exchange for the release of the Israeli diplomats, they lent themselves as guarantees and accompanied the terrorists on their freedom flight to Cairo. Chatichai continued as deputy foreign minister after the 1973 democratic uprising, serving in the interim cabinet of Sanya Dharmasakti. In December 1973, one and a half years before Thailand officially established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, Chatichai and Daweewho was then minister of defencewere the first Thai government officials to visit Beijing. There, they negotiated a contract for the supply of 50,000 tons of diesel oil at a \"friendship price\" and promised to remove trade barriers between the two nations.\n\nIn 1974, Chatichai and his in-laws Pramarn Adireksarn and Siri Siriyothinalso major generalsfounded the conservative and aggressively anti-communist Thai Nation Party (\"Chart Thai\"). It ran in the January 1975 general election, the first democratic election after the end of military dictatorship, and became the third-strongest party. Chatichai was elected member of parliament, representing a constituency in Nakhon Ratchasima Province. The Thai Nation Party joined a government coalition under Kukrit Pramoj. Chatichai served as minister of foreign affairs from 17 March 1975 to 21 April 1976. After the snap election in April 1976, in which the Thai Nation Party expanded its share of seats significantly, he was minister of industry in the government of Seni Pramoj until it was overthrown by a military coup d'état after the Thammasat University massacre of 6 October 1976. From 1980 to 1983, Chatichai served as industry minister under Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda. After three years of opposition, the party returned to government and Chatichai was deputy prime minister under Prem.\n\nThe Thai Nation Party won the most votes in the 1988 Thai general election, resulting in Chatichai being appointed prime minister on 4 August 1988. This made him the first democratically elected head of government after 12 years of dictatorship and \"semi-democracy\". His government improved relations with communist-ruled Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, which had been Thailand's enemies during the Cold War. It promoted international trade with these countries and others. Chatichai's slogan was to turn Indochina \"from a battlefield into a marketplace\". It also supported the Sihanouk-led Government of Cambodia. Chatichai's government initiated many infrastructure projects, including an expansion of the telecommunications network in partnership with the state-owned Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), development of the Eastern Seaboard of Thailand, and road and rail networks in partnership with the Mass Rapid Transit Authority (MRTA) in the Greater Bangkok Area. During Chatichai's premiership, Thailand's economy saw annual growth rates of up to 13 percent.\n\nUnder Chatichai's government, there was rampant corruption. The parties and politicians in Chatichai's coalition scrambled overtly over the distribution of public funds. The Thai press dubbed them the \"buffet cabinet\", referring to their \"take-what-you-like\" mentality. Chatichai's standard answer whenever he was confronted by the press with difficulties or corruption allegations against members of his government was \"no problem\". A parody variant, \"no plomplam\", became the title of a popular song by folk rock singer Aed Carabao and entered Thai common parlance. Chatichai was heavily criticised when he tried to downplay the damage caused by Typhoon Gay, which resulted in 360 deaths, in the same way.\n\nThe formerly right-wing Thai Nation Party had de-ideologized itself and now represented the interests of the rising class of provincial businessmen. It pursued policies that boosted their businesses and involved them in lucrative government contracts. It advocated a reinforcement of the role of parliament, in which politicians from the provinces were strongly represented, in contrast with the unelected power elites in the administration and military which had made political decisions during the tenure of Chatichai's predecessor, Prem Tinsulanonda. Chatichai's government emphasised the economic development of the periphery at the expense of Bangkok's big businesses and military expenditures, which it tried to cut. These policies challenged the country's traditional elites.\n\nOn 23 February 1991, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, General Sunthorn Kongsompong, and the generals of the Chulalongkorn Military Academy class 5, Suchinda Kraprayoon, Issarapong Noonpakdi, and Kaset Rojananil, formed the National Peace Keeping Council to depose Chatichai's government in a coup d'état. They accused the elected government of massive corruption and abuse of power for its own advantage. They charged several cabinet members, including Chatichai, with \"unusual wealth\". At the same time, they acted in the interest of the traditional elite of the bureaucracy, military and Bangkokian business circles, whose influence the Chatichai government had sought to curtail. The coup group called the form of governance under Chatichai \"parliamentary dictatorship\" and alleged a moral decline.\n\nChatichai temporarily went into exile in the United Kingdom. After his return, he continued his political activity. After the 1992 Black May, he founded the National Development Party and was again elected in his constituency in Nakhon Ratchasima.\n\nChatichai was known for his fondness of cigars, fine wines, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Even in old age, he practised several sports and visited parties and discothèques, earning him a reputation of being a playboy.\n\nOn 6 May 1998, at the age of 78, Chatichai died from liver cancer in a hospital in London.\n\n\n\n"}

With Corea's band he recorded five albums and shared two Grammy Award nominations. He spent twelve years as a member of Vital Information, led by Steve Smith. He reunited with the Elektric Band in 2002 and with Corea in 2011 when he joined Return to Forever IV with Stanley Clarke, Jean-Luc Ponty, and Lenny White.\n\nGambale has been head of the guitar department at the Los Angeles Music Academy. He joined the Isina mentorship program as head of the guitar department in 2014. During the next year, he started an online guitar school.\n\nGambale has become identified with sweep picking and economy picking. His interest grew out of a desire to transcend the physical limits of the guitar and borrow from other instruments, such as the piano and saxophone. One advantage of the technique is that it allows him to play faster. He can also approximate the way chords are played on piano by using his invented tuning, the Gambale Tuning, in which \"the whole guitar is tuned up a fourth, but the top two strings are down an octave\" (A, D, G, C, E, A, low to high).\n\nTo further explain the exact strings and tuning used in the Gambale Tuning, Frank posted this explanation on his Facebook page, June 10, 2019\n\n\"So, here is GAMBALE TUNING explained...and it only took me 40 years to invent this! ADGCEA. It's the same relative tuning as regular guitar but the lowest string is the 5th string A instead of the regular low E. Also, the 1st and 2nd strings are one octave lower. Here's the suggested string gauges. From low to high use strings from an electric 10 gauge standard set. Use only the A D G and B strings for the 6th, 5th, 4th and 3rd strings. The B string will be tuned up a half step to C. Then for the 1st and 2nd strings use a D and a G string from a standard 09 gauge set. These two strings are to be tuned up a whole step so the D will be tuned to E as the 2nd string wound, and the G will be tuned to A as the 1st string.\"\n\nGambale has been featured on the covers of many guitar and jazz-orientated magazines worldwide, while having been cited as an influence by many notable guitarists including Synyster Gates, Dweezil Zappa, Greg Howe, and Pat Metheny. In a 1991 interview with \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, guitarist Jerry Garcia stated that Gambale was one of his favorite players at the time, stating, \"My personal favorite lately is this guy Frank Gambale, who's been playing with Chick Corea for the past couple of years.\"\n\n\nWith Maurizio Colonna\n\nWith Chick Corea Elektric Band\n\nWith GHS\n\nWith GRP Super Live\n\nWith the Mark Varney Project\n\nWith Vital Information\n\n\n\n"}

It is the sequel to the 1988 Robert Altman-directed and Garry Trudeau-written miniseries about a failed presidential candidate, \"Tanner '88\". The sequel focuses mostly on Alex Tanner (Cynthia Nixon), a struggling filmmaker and the daughter of onetime presidential candidate Jack Tanner (Michael Murphy).\n\n\nAlex Tanner is working on a documentary about her father's run for president in 1988. After her documentary, \"My Candidate\", is met with an underwhelming response at an independent film festival, Robert Redford advises her that her film is lacking and that she should do follow-ups with all the people from the 1988 campaign to see what they are doing now, and get their reflections on their past roles.\n\nAlex does just this, interviewing most of the old campaign staffers and her father before going to the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston with her film crew to compare and contrast it with the 1988 Democratic National Convention where her father lost the nomination. Along the way, one of her crew members, Salim (Aasif Mandvi), is repeatedly stopped and frisked by police because of his Arab ethnicity. There she meets up with TJ, her father's old campaign manager, who is now advising John Kerry. While TJ provides assistance to Alex, she also advises Jack that he is being considered for a position in the administration, should Kerry win the election. She says he would need to make sure footage from Alex's documentary of him attacking the Iraq War is removed and destroyed, so as not to potentially embarrass Kerry. Jack asks Alex to remove and destroy the footage, which she considers the best part of her documentary. Alex becomes very upset and disillusioned with her father.

{"id": "1863125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863125", "title": "Cabinet of Singapore", "text": "Cabinet of Singapore\n\nThe Cabinet of Singapore forms the Government (executive branch) of Singapore together with the President of Singapore. It is led by the Prime Minister of Singapore who is the head of government. The Prime Minister is a Member of Parliament (MP) appointed by the President who selects a person that in his or her view is likely to command the confidence of a majority of the Parliament of Singapore. The other members of the Cabinet are Ministers who are Members of Parliament appointed by the President on the Prime Minister's advice. Cabinet members are prohibited from holding any office of profit and from actively engaging in any commercial enterprise.\n\nThe Cabinet generally directs and controls the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament. It also has significant influence over lawmaking. Ministers may be designated by the Prime Minister to be in charge of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Singapore's ministers are the best paid in the world. Prior to a salary review in 2011, the Prime Minister's annual salary was S$3.07 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers ranged between S$1.58 million and S$2.37 million. On 21 May 2011, a committee was appointed by the Prime Minister to review the salaries of the Prime Minister as well as the President, political appointment holders, and Members of Parliament. Following the recommended wage reductions by the committee which were then debated and subsequently accepted in Parliament, the Prime Minister's salary was reduced by 36% (includes the removal of his pension) to S$2.2 million (then about US$1.7 million). Nonetheless, the Prime Minister remains the highest-paid political leader in the world.\n\nThe earliest predecessor of the Cabinet was the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements, introduced in 1877 to advise the Governor of the Straits Settlements. It wielded no executive power. In 1955, a Council of Ministers was created, made up of three \"ex officio\" Official Members and six Elected Members of the Legislative Assembly of Singapore, appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Leader of the House. Following the general elections that year, David Saul Marshall became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. Constitutional talks between Legislative Assembly representatives and the Colonial Office were held from 1956 to 1958, and Singapore gained full internal self-government in 1959. The Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who had power to appoint to the post of Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. The executive branch of the Singapore Government remained unchanged following Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963, and subsequent independence in 1965.\n\nFollowing the 2011 general election, a Cabinet reshuffle took place effective 21 May 2011. Lim Hng Kiang and Lim Swee Say respectively retained their Trade and Industry and Prime Minister's Office portfolios, while other ministers were given new appointments to the remaining 11 ministries. Heng Swee Keat and Chan Chun Sing, both elected to Parliament for the first time, were respectively assigned the posts of Minister for Education, and Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports.\n\nA Cabinet Reshuffle took place in May 2018 with the stated purpose was to better prepare for a leadership transition to the \"4G\" leaders, Lim Hng Kiang who is the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Lim Swee Say who is Minister of Manpower & Yaacob Ibrahim who is Minister for Communications and Information all retired and were succeeded by Chan Chun Sing who is Ministry of Trade and Industry , Josephine Teo who is Minister of Manpower, and S. Iswaran who is Minister for Communications and Information respectively all of whom had previously held other cabinet appointments.\n\nUp to the outbreak of World War II, Singapore was part of the Crown colony known as the Straits Settlements together with Malacca and Penang. The earliest predecessor of the Cabinet was arguably the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements that was introduced in 1877 by letters patent issued by the Crown, though its function was very different from that of today's Cabinet. The Council, which was composed of \"such persons and constituted in such manner as may be directed\" by royal instructions, existed to advise the Governor of the Straits Settlements and wielded no executive power. The Governor was required to consult the Executive Council on all affairs of importance unless they were too urgent to be laid before it, or if reference to it would prejudice the public service. In such urgent cases, the Governor had to inform the Council of the measures he had taken.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the Straits Settlements were disbanded and Singapore became a Crown colony in its own right. The reconstituted Executive Council consisted of six officials and four nominated \"unofficials\". In February 1954, the Rendel Constitutional Commission under the chairmanship of Sir George William Rendel, which had been appointed to comprehensively review the constitution of the Colony of Singapore, rendered its report. Among other things, it recommended that a Council of Ministers be created, composed of three \"ex officio\" Official Members and six Elected Members of the Legislative Assembly of Singapore appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Leader of the House, who would be the leader of the largest political party or coalition of parties having majority support in the legislature. The recommendation was implemented in 1955. In the general election held that year, the Labour Front took a majority of the seats in the Assembly, and David Saul Marshall became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. Major problems with the Rendel Constitution were that the Chief Minister and Ministers' powers were ill-defined, and that the Official Members retained control of the finance, administration, and internal security and law portfolios. This led to confrontation between Marshall, who saw himself as a Prime Minister governing the country, and the Governor, Sir John Fearns Nicoll, who felt that important decisions and policies should remain with himself and the Official Members.\n\nIn 1956, members of the Legislative Assembly held constitutional talks with the Colonial Office in London. The talks broke down as Marshall did not agree to the British Government's proposal for the casting vote on a proposed Defence Council to be held by the British High Commissioner to Singapore, who would only exercise it in an emergency. Marshall resigned as Chief Minister in June 1956, and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock. The following year, Lim led another delegation to the UK for further talks on self-government. This time, agreement was reached on the composition of an Internal Security Council. Other constitutional arrangements were swiftly settled in 1958, and on 1 August the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the State of Singapore Act 1958, granting the colony full internal self-government. Under Singapore's new constitution which came into force on 3 June 1959, the Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State), who had power to appoint as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Legislative Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. The Constitution also created the post of the British High Commissioner, who was entitled to receive the agenda of each Cabinet meeting and to see all Cabinet papers. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. Nine other Ministers were appointed to the Cabinet.\n\nThe British High Commissioner's role became that of an ambassador following Singapore's independence from Britain and merger with Malaysia in 1963. Apart from that the executive branch of the Singapore Government remained largely unchanged, although now it governed a state within a larger federation. However, with effect from 9 August 1965, Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia and became a fully independent republic. On separation from Malaysia, the Singapore Government retained its executive authority, and the executive authority of the Parliament of Malaysia ceased to extend to Singapore and vested in the Singapore Government. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Supreme Head of State of Malaysia, also ceased to be the Supreme Head of Singapore and relinquished his sovereignty, jurisdiction, power and authority, executive or otherwise in respect of Singapore, which revested in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore. The Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 then vested the executive authority of Singapore in the newly created post of President, and made it exercisable by him or by the Cabinet or by any Minister authorized by the Cabinet.\n\nSingapore inherited a Westminster system of government from the British. In such systems, there is an overlap between the executive and legislative branches of government. The head of state, who is the President of Singapore, is a member of both the executive Government of Singapore and the Parliament of Singapore but plays a minimal role in them. Executive power lies in the hands of the Cabinet, which is made up of the Prime Minister of Singapore (the head of government) and other Ministers. At the same time, the Prime Minister and Ministers are also Members of Parliament (MPs).\n\nFollowing constitutional reforms in 1991, the office of President was transformed from an appointed to an elected post. Thus, both the President and MPs are elected to their posts by the citizens of Singapore in separate elections.\n\nThe President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament.\n\nThe President also appoints other Ministers to the Cabinet from among the MPs, acting in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice. Any MP, including a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) or a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), may be appointed a Minister. Thus it is possible for a person who was not elected by voters to be appointed by Parliament as an NMP, then by the President as a Minister. In 1990, then Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in Parliament: \"I would rather that a government has the flexibility to appoint the right person to be the minister for finance, than to compel that government to select from whoever is available in the House.\" However, he added that the Government had no intention to appoint a Cabinet minister from among the NMPs at that time. In May 2009, MP Hri Kumar proposed during a Parliamentary debate that this stand be reconsidered as the Prime Minister would be able to draw on the experience of many capable Singaporeans. He expressed the view that this would not offend democratic principles. Singapore's Parliamentary system placed more weight on the party in power rather than individual MPs, and \"Parliamentarians must still win the support from the ground and, ultimately, the PM and the ruling party and his Cabinet team will still be answerable to the electorate at elections.\" Critics have commented that adopting the practice would disenchant Singaporeans, deepen the already parochial political culture, and lead to a lack of accountability and legitimacy.\n\nBefore entering on the duties of their office, the Prime Minister and other Ministers must take and subscribe (sign) the Oath of Allegiance and an oath for the due execution of their offices before the President. The Oath of Allegiance reads as follows:\n\nThe oath for the due execution of the office of Prime Minister or a Minister is as follows:\n\nCabinet members are prohibited from holding any office of profit or actively engaging in any commercial enterprise. In addition, they are required to comply with a \"Code of Conduct for Ministers\". For example, to counter potential allegations of corruption and unexplained wealth and to avoid potential conflicts between private interests and public responsibilities, the Code requires every Minister, upon appointment to office, to disclose in confidence to the President through the Prime Minister all sources of income other than his salary as a Minister and as an MP. This must include all assets, such as financial assets, real property, interests in any company or professional practice, and any other substantial personal assets as well as financial liabilities, including mortgages and borrowings. A Minister must also \"scrupulously avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest between his office and his private financial interests\". Thus, a Minister is not permitted to accept any favour of any kind from persons in negotiation with, or seeking to obtain any licence or enter into any contractual relations with, the Government, or to use official information that comes to him as a Minister for his own private profit or the profit of any family member or associate.\n\nThe President must declare the office of Prime Minister vacant if the Prime Minister resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the MPs. In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the Prime Minister of his evaluation in this regard, and if the Prime Minister requests him to, the President may dissolve Parliament instead of making a declaration of vacancy. A general election must be held within three months after the dissolution of Parliament. This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls.\n\nAt present, it is not clear what evidence the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of \"Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg\", decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase \"ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament\" was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in \"Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah\" that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.\n\nOther Cabinet ministers must vacate their office if they resign, or if their appointments are revoked by the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister. A person who has vacated his or her office as Minister may, if qualified, be subsequently appointed again as a Minister.\n\nThe Prime Minister and other Ministers who make up the Cabinet do not vacate their offices upon a dissolution of Parliament, but continue in their posts until the first sitting of the next Parliament following a general election.\n\nThe executive authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him or by the Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet. However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role in the executive branch of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the Cabinet is collectively responsible to Parliament. In theory, Parliament acts as a check on the power of the Cabinet as Ministers are required to justify their actions and policies upon being questioned by MPs. However, in Singapore this is a weak check because the ruling People's Action Party holds a large Parliamentary majority, and party members who are MPs are required by party discipline to vote according to the party Whip's instructions.\n\nThe Cabinet may not be summoned except by the authority of the Prime Minister. As far as is practicable, the Prime Minister is required to attend and preside at Cabinet meetings, but in his absence he may appoint another Minister to preside.\n\nWhenever the Prime Minister is ill, absent from Singapore, or has been granted leave of absence from his duties, the functions conferred on him by the Constitution are exercisable by any other Minister authorized by the President. In general, the President must act in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice in appointing a Minister for this purpose. However, the President may act in his own discretion if in his opinion it is impracticable to obtain the advice of the Prime Minister due to his illness or absence.\n\nThe Prime Minister may, by giving written directions, charge any Minister with responsibility for any department or subject. In practice, this is done by issuing notifications that are published in the \"Government Gazette\". For instance, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Responsibility of Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security, Prime Minister's Office) Notification 2009 states:\n\nMinisters may be designated by the Prime Minister to be in charge of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Such Ministers were formerly known as Ministers without portfolio.\n\nThe Prime Minister may retain any department or subject in his charge.\n\nIn 1994, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong received a monthly salary of nearly S$96,000 (about $1.15 million a year), while other ministers earned about $48,900 a month ($586,800 a year). This made them among the highest paid government ministers in the world. In October that year, the Government issued a white paper entitled \"Competitive Salaries for Competent & Honest Government\" which proposed that the salaries of ministers and civil servants be pegged at two-thirds the average principal earned income of the top four earners in six professions: accounting, banking, engineering, law, local manufacturing firms and multinational corporations. These professions were chosen because their top members had general management skills which ministers also had to have. According to the white paper, the one-third \"discount\" would be \"a visible demonstration of the sacrifice involved in becoming a minister\". Although \"[s]alaries should never be the motivation for persons to become ministers\", the financial sacrifice had to be minimized if outstanding and committed Singaporeans were to be encouraged to take on the \"risks and public responsibilities of a political career\". The benchmark would also be used to determine the pay of the President, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Attorney-General, Chairman of the Public Service Commission and judges.\n\nFollowing Parliamentary approval of the white paper in November 1994, the Government established an independent panel to examine the benchmark for the Prime Minister's salary. The panel's report, released in January 1995, recommended that the benchmark be about $1.6 million a year, but said it would be reasonable for the Prime Minister to be paid $2.4 million in view of his heavy responsibilities. The Government said that in three years it planned to raise the pay of the Prime Minister to $1.46 million and that of ministers to 60% of the benchmark, and in the \"longer term\" to $1.6 million and two-thirds of the benchmark respectively.\n\nIn February 1996 it was reported that a survey of 19 countries by the World Economic Forum magazine \"World Link\" had found that political leaders and senior civil servants of Singapore had the highest salaries. The pay of the Singapore Prime Minister (S$1.1 million, or US$812,858) was almost five times the average pay of the chief political executives of the nations surveyed (US$168,291). Senior civil servants were paid US$292,714, almost three times their counterparts' average pay.\n\nIn August 2000, in view of the Singapore economy's growth of almost 10% led by a rapid increase in exports, the salary of the Prime Minister was increased by 14% and those of other ministers by 12%. In response to public disquiet, Goh Chok Tong said that, spread across the population, the rises amounted to about $11 per person, equivalent to \"about five plates of char kway teow [fried noodles with cockles] per Singaporean\". Subsequently, in late 2001, when Singapore experienced its worst recession in a generation, ministerial pay was reduced by more than 17%. Nonetheless, it was reported that the prime minister still earned a gross annual salary of about $1.03 million before the variable component was taken into account.\n\nIn April 2007, the Prime Minister's annual salary increased to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), about five times that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary. The pay increases were justified by the Government on the grounds that the salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: \"We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [the government]. But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us.\" The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: \"It would be a sad indictment of my generation if no one came forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed.\" On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: \"To make it quite clear why I am doing this, and also to give me the moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will hold my own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the way the system will have to work, but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes.\" The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.\n\nIn 2008, the annual salary for entry-level ministers was $1,924,300. In view of the worsening economic crisis in 2008–2009, as of January 2009 the Prime Minister's salary was cut to $3.04 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers was reduced by 18% to $1.57 million. In November 2009 the Public Service Division announced that pay increments would be deferred for a second time in 2010 because of the uncertain economic recovery. A minister's 2009 salary of $1,494,700 per year was therefore 22% lower than what he or she received in 2008.\n\nAs at 31 December 2010, the remuneration of ministers depended on which ministerial grade – from the lowest to the highest, MR4, MR3, MR2 or MR1 – they were at. Each minister's pay package was made up of fixed components (a monthly salary for 12 months, a non-pensionable annual allowance of one month's salary, a special allowance of one month's salary, and a public service leadership allowance of two months' salary) and variable components (an annual variable component, a performance bonus, and a gross domestic product (GDP) bonus). The annual variable component of up to one and a half-month's salary was paid based on Singapore's economic performance. In years where economic performance was exceptional, a special variable payment was also made. Each minister's performance bonus was determined by the Prime Minister and could be up to 14 months' salary, though most good performers received the equivalent of nine months' salary. The GDP bonus depended on the nation's GDP growth rate. No bonus was paid if the rate was below 2%, and a maximum bonus of eight months' salary was paid if the rate was 10% or greater. In addition, ministers received the same medical benefits as civil servants. In 2010, the benchmark annual remuneration for an MR4-grade minister was $2,598,004, while the actual salary paid was $1,583,900. An MR1-grade minister's salary was $2,368,500. The annual pay of the Prime Minister was set at a fixed ratio to the MR4 salary, and was $3,072,200 in 2010. This included a fixed service bonus in lieu of a performance bonus since there was no one to assess the Prime Minister's individual performance. The fixed service bonus was the same as the performance bonus paid to a good performer at the MR4 grade.\n\nOn 21 May 2011, following the 2011 general election, the Prime Minister announced that a committee would be appointed to review politicians' remuneration, and that revised salaries would take effect from that date. The Committee to Review Ministerial Salaries chaired by Gerard Ee rendered its report on 30 December 2011, and released it to the public on 4 January 2012. As regards ministerial pay, the Committee recommended benchmarking an MR4-grade minister's salary to the median income of the top 1,000 wage earners who are Singapore citizens, with a 40% discount \"to signify the sacrifice that comes with the ethos of political service\". It also recommended removing the special allowance and public service leadership allowance; capping performance bonuses at six months' salary (with good performers generally receiving three months' salary); and replacing the GDP bonus with a national bonus based on four equally weighted indicators: the real median income growth rate (that is, the growth rate taking inflation into account), the real growth rate of the incomes of the lowest 20th percentile earners, the unemployment rate, and the real GDP growth rate. As regards the latter, no bonus will be paid if the minimum targets for the indicators are not met. A bonus of three months' salary will be paid if the targets are met, and a maximum bonus of six months' salary if the targets are greatly exceeded. This would result in a reduction of an M4-grade minister's annual salary by 31% of the 2010 figure to $1.1 million.\n\nWhere the Prime Minister's remuneration was concerned, the Committee recommended that it be pegged to twice of a MR4-grade minister's salary and doing away with the fixed service bonus. Instead, the Prime Minister will receive a larger national bonus. His annual bonus where the targets for the indicators have been met will be six months' salary, and 12 months' salary where they have been greatly exceeded. This will lead to a reduction in the Prime Minister's annual salary of 28% to $2.2 million (about US$1.7 million). Lee Hsien Loong said that he accepted the Committee's recommendations. He remains the best-paid head of government in the world, his proposed annual pay package exceeding that of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Sir Donald Tsang, the political leader with the second-highest salary in the world (around US$550,000), by about three times; and that of the President of the United States Barack Obama (US$400,000) by over four times.\n\nThe Committee's report was discussed in Parliament from 16 to 18 January 2012. Setting out the position of the Workers' Party, Chen Show Mao said that the basic monthly salary of an MP should be $11,000, the pay of an MX9-grade director in the Management Executive Scheme of the Civil Service. A minister should be paid five times this sum ($55,000), and the Prime Minister nine times ($99,000). NCMP Gerald Giam said that ministers should obtain an average annual bonus of three months of their base salaries, and in any case no more than five months' bonus. Two-thirds of the bonus should be made up of the national bonus, and the remaining third based on the individual's performance, which should be determined according to key performance indicators fixed for each ministry at the start of a new government's term. Moreover, only a portion of bonuses should be paid at the end of each year. Payment of the remainder should be deferred till the end of the government's term. If the minister's performance is poor, some of the withheld bonus should be clawed back. The WP's proposal was criticized by a number of PAP MPs. Minister of State for Health Amy Khor expressed the view that \"[p]olitical service is much more than public service. Civil servants are not subject to the votes of citizens nor do they need to carry the ground in policymaking. ... Pegging ministerial salaries to civil service salaries is not an adequate mechanism to account for the burdens and responsibilities that come with the job.\"\n\nRounding up the debate, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said that under the WP's proposal for calculating ministerial salaries, the quantum achieved was similar to the sum proposed by the Committee, and that in his view the WP had approved the three principles of the new system: the requirement for the pay to be competitive, recognition of the ethos of political service, and the desirability of a \"clean wage\" system (that is, one in which ministers do not receive additional benefits such as housing and medical allowances). PAP MPs then voted to endorse the Committee's proposals.\n\nOn 26 March 2012, the Public Service Division of the Prime Minister's Office announced that the fixed component of the salary of a political appointment holder would be 13 months of his or her monthly salary. For 2011, the annual variable component of the salary would be 1.25 months plus $250, while the national bonus would be 2.625 months though appointment holders would receive a pro rata amount of 1.618 months' pay as the new salaries took effect from 21 May 2011 when the Cabinet was appointed following the general election. The targets for the four indicators making up the national bonus were 2–3% for real median income growth of citizens and real median income growth for the lowest 20th percentile of citizens, 3–5% for real GDP growth, and not more than 4.5% for the unemployment rate of citizens. Each appointment holder's performance bonus would be determined by the Prime Minister.\n\nAt present, persons who have reached the age of 50 years and retired as MPs and who have served in this capacity for not less than nine years may be granted a pension for the rest of their lives. The annual amount payable is of the person's highest annual salary for every completed year of service and for every uncompleted year, up to a ceiling of two-thirds of the Member's annual salary. In addition, a retired MP who is at least 50 years old and has for not less than eight years held the office of Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Senior Minister or Minister may receive an additional pension each year of of his or her highest annual salary for each completed year of service and for each uncompleted year, subject again to a ceiling of two-thirds of the office-holder's annual salary. Members who have reached the age of 55 years and have served not less than eight years as Ministers may be granted a pension even if they have not yet ceased to hold office. No person has an absolute right to compensation for past services or to any pension or gratuity, and the President may reduce or withhold pensions and gratuities upon an MP's conviction for corruption.\n\nThe Committee to Review Ministerial Salaries recommended that pensions for political appointment holders be abolished in favour of Central Provident Fund payments. Appointment holders appointed on and after 21 May 2011 will not receive any pension, while those appointed before that date will only be eligible for pensions accrued up to that date. Such pensions will be paid after they step down or retire from office. If the removal of pensions is taken into account, the Prime Minister's annual salary will be reduced from the 2010 figure by 36%, and that of MR4-grade ministers by 37%.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863128", "title": "Ryanodine receptor", "text": "Ryanodine receptor\n\nRyanodine receptors (RyRs) form a class of intracellular calcium channels in various forms of excitable animal tissue like muscles and neurons.\nThere are three major isoforms of the ryanodine receptor, which are found in different tissues and participate in different signaling pathways involving calcium release from intracellular organelles. The RYR2 ryanodine receptor isoform is the major cellular mediator of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) in animal cells.\n\nThe ryanodine receptors are named after the plant alkaloid ryanodine which shows a high affinity to them.\n\nThere are multiple isoforms of ryanodine receptors: \n\nRyanodine receptors mediate the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum, an essential step in muscle contraction. In skeletal muscle, activation of ryanodine receptors occurs via a physical coupling to the dihydropyridine receptor (a voltage-dependent, L-type calcium channel), whereas, in cardiac muscle, the primary mechanism of activation is calcium-induced calcium release, which causes calcium outflow from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n\nIt has been shown that calcium release from a number of ryanodine receptors in a ryanodine receptor cluster results in a spatiotemporally restricted rise in cytosolic calcium that can be visualised as a \"calcium spark\". Ryanodine receptors are very close to mitochondria and calcium release from RyR has been shown to regulate ATP production in heart and pancreas cells.\n\nRyanodine receptors are similar to the inositol trisphosphate (IP) receptor, and stimulated to transport Ca into the cytosol by recognizing Ca on its \"cytosolic side\", thus establishing a positive feedback mechanism; a small amount of Ca in the cytosol near the receptor will cause it to release even more Ca (calcium-induced calcium release/CICR). However, as the concentration of intracellular Ca rises, this can trigger closing of RyR, preventing the total depletion of SR. This finding therefore indicates that a plot of opening probability for RyR as a function of Ca concentration is a bell-curve. Furthermore, RyR can sense the Ca concentration inside the ER/SR and spontaneously open in a process known as store overload-induced calcium release (SOICR).\n\nRyRs are especially important in neurons and muscle cells. In heart and pancreas cells, another second messenger (cyclic ADP-ribose) takes part in the receptor activation.\n\nThe localized and time-limited activity of Ca in the cytosol is also called a \"Ca wave\". The building of the wave is done by \n\nRyRs form docking platforms for a multitude of proteins and small molecule ligands.\nThe cardiac-specific isoform of the receptor (RyR2) is known to form a quaternary complex with luminal calsequestrin, junctin, and triadin. Calsequestrin has multiple Ca binding sites and binds Ca ions with very low affinity so they can be easily released.\n\n\nA variety of other molecules may interact with and regulate ryanodine receptor. For example: dimerized Homer physical tether linking inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) and ryanodine receptors on the intracellular calcium stores with cell surface group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors and the Alpha-1D adrenergic receptor\n\nThe plant alkaloid ryanodine, for which this receptor was named, has become an invaluable investigative tool. It can block the phasic release of calcium, but at low doses may not block the tonic cumulative calcium release. The binding of ryanodine to RyRs is \"use-dependent\", that is the channels have to be in the activated state. At low (<10 micromolar, works even at nanomolar) concentrations, ryanodine binding locks the RyRs into a long-lived subconductance (half-open) state and eventually depletes the store, while higher (~100 micromolar) concentrations irreversibly inhibit channel-opening.\n\nRyRs are activated by millimolar caffeine concentrations. High (greater than 5 mmol/L) caffeine concentrations cause a pronounced increase (from micromolar to picomolar) in the sensitivity of RyRs to Ca in the presence of caffeine, such that basal Ca concentrations become activatory. At low millimolar caffeine concentrations, the receptor opens in a quantal way, but has complicated behavior in terms of repeated use of caffeine or dependence on cytosolic or luminal calcium concentrations.\n\nRyR1 mutations are associated with malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. RyR2 mutations play a role in stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (a form of cardiac arrhythmia) and ARVD. It has also been shown that levels of type RyR3 are greatly increased in PC12 cells overexpressing mutant human Presenilin 1, and in brain tissue in knockin mice that express mutant Presenilin 1 at normal levels, and thus may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease. \n\nThe presence of antibodies against ryanodine receptors in blood serum has also been associated with myasthenia gravis.\n\nRecently, sudden cardiac death in several young individuals in the Amish community (four of which were from the same family) was traced to homozygous duplication of a mutant RyR2 (Ryanodine Receptor) gene. Normal (wild type) ryanodine receptors are involved in CICR in heart and other muscles, and RyR2 functions primarily in the myocardium (heart muscle).\nRyR1 cryo-EM structure revealed a large cytosolic assembly built on an extended α-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture shares the general structure of the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the α-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca.\n\n"}
{"id": "1863129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863129", "title": "Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council", "text": "Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council\n\nStockport Metropolitan Borough Council is the local authority for the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. The council is currently in no overall control, as at the 2016 local elections the Liberal Democrats lost their majority. Currently, Labour and the Liberal Democrats both have 26 seats, and the Conservatives have 8. There are also 3 independent councillors that represent the Heald Green Ratepayers.\n\nStockport is currently covered by four constituencies: Cheadle, Stockport, Hazel Grove and Denton and Reddish.\n\nThere are 21 wards, each represented by three councillors.\n\nThe Cabinet of the Council consists of eight Councillors:\n\n\nStockport Metropolitan Borough Council (Stockport Council) uses a cabinet system. There are eight cabinet members, including the leader of the council; each has a separate portfolio containing responsibilities for different services and areas of the council. There are also six scrutiny committees which scrutinise decisions made by the cabinet.\n\nStockport Council has 63 elected members, belonging to three different parties. No party has overall control.\n\nIn the 2004 election, all councillors on the council were put up for election at the same time. This election was conducted exclusively by postal voting. Each elector was given three votes, and asked to pick three candidates. The number of votes each candidate received then determined when they would next stand for election.\n\nElections were then scheduled for 2006, 2007, and 2008.\n\nIn the council elections on Thursday 1 May 2008, in which one third of the seats were up for re-election, there were two main changes. In the Cheadle & Gatley ward, incumbent councillor Paul Carter of the Liberal Democrat party lost his seat to the Conservative candidate Mick Jones. Similarly in the Brinnington and Central Ward, Labour councillor Maureen Rowles lost her seat to the Liberal Democrat candidate Christian Walker. However, a short time after this election, he chose to serve as an Independent Councillor, then returned to the Liberal Democrats, then declared himself Independent again.\n\nDuring 2009, which was supposed to be a \"fallow year\" (one without elections), there were three by-elections following the deaths of serving councillors. Subsequently, Labour Councillor Anne Graham joined the Liberal Democrat group, bringing them to 36 Councillors of 63.\n\nOn 2 February 2011, Councillors David White, Roy Driver and Anne Graham all resigned from the Liberal Democrat Group. All three cited unhappiness with the national party's involvement with a \"Tory-led\" government. They became Independent Left Councillors, forming the Independent Left Group on the Council, whilst awaiting the result of membership applications to the Labour Party and subsequently joined the Labour Group after the 2011 elections. Roy Driver was not selected for a seat in the May 2011 and unsuccessfully contested Bredbury and Woodley for Labour in May 2012. He was eventually elected councillor for Reddish North in 2015.\n\nOn 21 January 2012, Patrick McAuley, Labour Councillor for Manor since May 2011, announced on Twitter that he had resigned from the Labour Party but that would continue to serve as a councillor; he subsequently joined the Liberal Democrat group in December 2012, but quit in April 2016, a month after being re-elected.\n\nIn October and November 2014, Stockport Labour lost 3 seats with Brian Hendley, Paul Moss and Laura Booth all leaving the party. Hendley was deselected without his knowing, Moss resigned due to house building on Reddish Vale Country Park and Booth quit over allegations of a \"culture of systematic bullying\".\n\nHeald Green Ratepayers are the only non-mainstream candidates to win seats.\n\n"}

From 1891 to 1895 he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became one of the Cambridge Apostles. He studied Classics and then law; his father wanted him to follow a career as a barrister, but his ambition was to be a poet.\n\nDescribed as a \"rumpled, eccentric poet\", and sometimes considered a rather ineffectual person, he was close to the Bloomsbury Group, who called him 'Bob Trevy'. He had a wide further range of social connections: George Santayana from 1905; Isaac Rosenberg; Bernard Berenson; Bertrand Russell; G. E. Moore; E. M. Forster with whom he and Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson travelled to India in 1912. His pacifist principles extended to sheltering John Rodker, \"on the run\" as a conscientious objector during World War I; when he became liable to conscription by the raising of the maximum age in 1918, he volunteered for the Friends' War Victims Relief Service, serving in France, August 1918-March 1919. \n\nHe married the Dutch musician Elizabeth van der Hoeven; the artist Julian Trevelyan was their son.\n\nTrevelyan wrote a number of verse plays; \"The Bride of Dionysus\" (1912) was made into an opera by Sir Donald Tovey.\n\n\n"}

In the 19th century, however, the aria was rediscovered and became one of Handel's best-known pieces. Handel adapted the aria from the setting by Giovanni Bononcini, who, in turn, adapted it from the setting by Francesco Cavalli. All three composers had produced settings of the same opera libretto by Nicolò Minato.\n\nOriginally composed to be sung by a soprano castrato (and sung in modern performances of \"Serse\" by a countertenor, contralto or a mezzo-soprano), it has been arranged for other voice types and instruments, including solo organ, solo piano, violin and piano, and string ensembles, often under the title \"Largo from \"Xerxes\"\", although the original tempo is marked \"larghetto\".\n\nIn the opera, the aria is preceded by a short \"recitativo accompagnato\" of 9 bars, setting the scene (\"Frondi tenere e belle\"). The aria itself is also short; it consists of 52 bars and typically lasts three to four minutes.\nThe instrumentation is for a string section: first and second violins, viola, and basses. The key signature is F major, the time signature is 3/4 time. The vocal range covers C to F with a tessitura from F to F.\n\nThe title translates from the Italian as \"Never was a shade\".

His infancy was marked by a bloody feud with the powerful family of the Araújos, causing many deaths in both families, following the tragic cycle of vengeance and honour which were so common in these regions. After the death of his mother in 1834, his father married again, and Antônio and his two sisters suffered with the father's alcoholism and maltreatment by their stepmother. Antônio went to study with his grandfather, Manoel Antônio Ferreira Nobre, who was a teacher in Quixeramobim. He developed well as a serious, quiet and hard-working pupil, studying Latin, French, Portuguese, mathematics, geography and history. In 1855 his father died and he assumed the family's business, striving to get his sisters married. In 1857, Antônio himself married Brasilina Laurentina de Lima and began working as a salesman, teacher and lay counselor (poorman's lawyer). Already with two children, he was betrayed by his wife in 1861, and disillusioned and depressed, he separated from them and retired to a farm, working as a rural teacher, and devoting himself more and more to Christian mysticism. Moving again to Santa Quitéria, Ceará, he had a third child, a son named Joaquim Aprígio, after a brief affair with a local artist named Joana Imaginária. He was restless, however, and started to wander around the country, from 1865 to 1869, and then from 1871 and afterwards.\n\nHe was tall and thin, with long black hair and beard, always dressed in a rough blue tunic, a straw hat and leather sandals, carrying a necklace with a wooden cross, Antônio Maciel cut an impressive figure, reminding people of Jesus Christ. Gradually he became a pilgrim, an itinerant benefactor and counsellor of the poor, as well a pious preacher and religious leader. He was called alternatively by the simple people of the region as \"Antônio Conselheiro\", \"Santo Antônio dos Mares\", \"Santo Antônio Aparecido\" or \"Bom Jesus Conselheiro\", and began to attract not only admirers, but fanatical followers, who started travelling with him.\n\nIn 1874, Antônio Conselheiro began to attract the attention of authorities and the Catholic Church, due to his preaching to the oppressed and poor peasants and common folk of small villages and farms. In 1876 he was arrested by the police in Itapicuru, Bahia, under the suspicion of being a wanted criminal. After being identified, he was sent by ship to Fortaleza. He was severely beaten, his hair and beard were cut and he was sent back for trial to his city of origin, Quixeramobim. The local judge, however, released Antônio Conselheiro due to the absence of any criminal charges against him. Antônio returned immediately to Bahia and restarted his wandering and preaching. He vowed to construct 21 churches and proceeded to do so in 12 cities in the backlands of the provinces of Bahia and Sergipe, as well as cemeteries and small dams. \n\nIn 1877, one of the periodical catastrophic droughts began in the Northeast. It would be two years long and kill more than 300,000 peasants by hunger and thirst, creating havoc with the predominantly semi-arid agrarian economy of the region. Many villages were entirely abandoned and instances of cannibalism even occurred. Antônio Conselheiro and his followers did what they could to diminish the extreme suffering of the poor people, adding more and more admirers and followers to his group. The sense of an impending end of the world and that the only salvation could come through religion were strong incentives to the surge of religious fanaticism. Conselheiro was widely regarded as a saint and a Messiah. Due to his increasing criticism of the official Church, and his open preachings in the small churches of the backlands, in 1882 the Archbishop of Bahia issued an order forbidding priests to allow him access to the flocks and characterising Antônio Conselheiro as an apostate and as a madman.\n\nIn 1888 and 1889, Brazil went through the most revolutionary and far-reaching social, economic and political changes of its history since Europeans settled in 1500. On May 13, 1888, slavery was abolished by the ruling Emperor, Dom Pedro II, by an act signed by his daughter, Princess Isabel. More than five million black people were suddenly out of work, abandoned the farms and swelled enormously the rural and urban ranks of extremely poor inhabitants. Tens of thousands of farmers went broke and agriculture almost stopped for a while, particularly for cash crops which required intensive labor, such as coffee, cotton, tobacco and sugarcane, the mainstays of the Brazilian economy at the time. On November 15, 1889, the Emperor was deposed by a military coup and the Republic was proclaimed, further adding instability and strife to the already torn-up country.\n\nAll this was important to the make-up of Canudos. Antônio Conselheiro was strongly against slavery, and had preached and written about it, incurring in the wrath of farmers and authorities. The number of his flocks increased dramatically, and it is estimated that over 80% were former slaves. In addition, he considered that monarchy was a grant of God, and that the Republic, with its separation between Church and State, was morally wrong and would wreck the country and family, a kind of new antichrist. Again he stepped up public criticism and rallied the social movement around these flags. General nervousness of farmers, priests and government increased to hysterical fear.\n\nFinally, in 1893, violence erupted. Protesting against taxes levied by the new Republican government in Masseté, state of Bahia, \"Conselhistas\" (as Antônio Conselheiro's organized following was named) were attacked by a small police force and retaliated.\n\nAntônio Conselheiro decided then to retreat and to establish in 1893 a permanent place for his growing band of now quasi-insurrectionaries. Near the city of Monte Santo, in the Northeast tip of Bahia, he founded the village of Bello Monte (\"Fair Hill\"), in an area named Canudos. It was set in an abandoned farm amid several mountain ranges, near the Vaza-Barris River. \n\nIn Canudos, Antônio Conselheiro, aided by a local government by committee, composed by 12 \"apostles\", or elders, established a communist-like social system, with division of labour and produce, common property, abolition of civil marriage and of the official currency, prohibition of taverns, liquor and prostitution, rigid control over crimes and mandatory religious activities. He also gave a measure of personal freedom from injustice and oppression by landlords and governmental authorities. The fame of Canudos spread rapidly throughout the Northeast, as being a promised land of \"milk and honey\". Former black slaves, uprooted indigenous people and impoverished and landless mestizos started to come in droves to Canudos. By one year later, Canudos already had 8,000 new residents; by 1895 its population had grown to more than 30,000 and more than 5,000 dwellings. Two churches and one school were also built and commerce and agriculture became more organised.\n\nThe massive presence of such kinds of people started to cause much fear and trouble in the region, since many of the new residents were not-so-peaceful \"jagunços\" (hired armed men who worked for farmers), leading to appeals to the government for repression and control. Fearing an invasion of the city of Juazeiro by the \"Conselhistas\", who had a dispute with a lumber merchant, its mayor appealed hysterically to the provincial government. A visit by two Capuchin friars to Canudos was insufficient to calm the population and one of them mistakenly accused Antônio Conselheiro of trying to raise a monarchist sedition.\n\nAll was set for the start of military aggression against the largely peaceful settlement.\n\nDuring the military siege that ensued, Antônio Conselheiro, anguished by the death, hunger and suffering of his followers, spent his time praying and severe fasting. He was no military leader. Due to his severe fasting, he died at the age 67, on September 22, 1897, probably of dysentery. His death was the beginning of Canudos' defeat, which eventually brought about the brutal death of probably more than 50% of the city's inhabitants during the military operations and ensuing atrocities committed against civilians by the victors.\n\nThe corpse of Antônio Conselheiro was located, disinterred and identified by military surgeons, his head was cut off and sent to Salvador, both as a proof and as a war spoil. It was examined by the noted forensic medicine expert, Dr. Raimundo Nina Rodrigues, and placed in permanent exhibition in the museum of the Escola Bahiana de Medicina (Medical School of Bahia), where it was destroyed in a fire in May 1905.\n\nBesides his written preachings, Antônio Conselheiro left only one religious treatise, written in May 1895 and titled \"Apontamentos dos Preceitos da Divina Lei de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo, para a Salvação dos Homens\" (\"Annotations on the Precepts of Our Lord Jesus Christ's Divine Law for the Salvation of Men\").\n\nThe story of Antônio Conselheiro and the War of Canudos has been dramatized in Euclides da Cunha's \"Rebellion in the Backlands\" (\"Os Sertões\"). He is also portrayed in \"The War of the End of the World\", a novel in Spanish by the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa. The story of Antônio Maciel, and the founding of, and war on, Canudos is also told in the novel \"The First Garment\", by Georgian writer Guram Dochanashvili. The Scottish author R. B. Cunninghame Graham wrote \"A Brazilian Mystic: Being the Life and Miracles of Antonio Conselheiro\".\n\n\"\"...a thousand flocks shall run from the seacoast to the backlands; and then the backlands will turn into seacoast and the seacoast into backlands.\"\" (\"\"...há de vir rebanhos mil correndo do centro da Praia para o sertão então o sertão virará Praia e a Praia virará sertão.\"\")\n"}
{"id": "1863143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863143", "title": "The Longest Journey (novel)", "text": "The Longest Journey (novel)\n\nThe Longest Journey is a bildungsroman by E. M. Forster, first published in 1907. It is the second of Forster's six published novels, following \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\" (1905) and preceding \"A Room with a View\" (1908) and \"Howards End\" (1910). It has a reputation for being the least known of Forster's novels, but was also the author's personal favourite and one of his most autobiographical. It is the only one of Forster's novels not to have received a film or television adaptation.\n\nRickie Elliot is a student at early 20th century Cambridge, a university that seems like paradise to him, amongst bright if cynical companions, when he receives a visit from two friends, an engaged young woman, Agnes Pembroke, and her elder brother, Herbert. The Pembrokes are Rickie's only friends from home. An orphan who grew up living with cousins, he was sent to a public (boarding) school where he was shunned and bullied because of his lame foot, an inherited weakness, and frail body. Agnes, as it happens, is engaged to Gerald, now in the army, who was one of the sturdy youths who bullied Rickie at school. Rickie is not brilliant at argument, but he is intensely responsive to poetry and art, and is accepted within a circle of philosophical and intellectual fellow-students led by a brilliant but especially cynical aspiring philosopher, Stewart Ansell, who refuses, when he is introduced to her, even to acknowledge that Agnes exists.\n\nWhen visiting the Pembrokes during his vacation, Rickie has an epiphanic vision of the sexual bond between Gerald, who is coarse but handsome and athletic, and Agnes, a bond he cannot imagine for himself. He takes these lovers' side in trying to speed their marriage, offering part of his own inheritance, an offer that insults Gerald. When Gerald is suddenly killed in a football match, Rickie finds a role consoling Agnes—he tells her she should \"mind\" what has happened, that is, that she should grieve—since her passion for Gerald has been the main event of her life. Rickie becomes Agnes' chief consolation and support, though he is in every way Gerald's opposite, and after a year or two, despite the failure of Rickie's stories to find a publisher, he and Agnes become engaged to marry.\n\nThe young couple pay a visit to Rickie's Aunt Emily Failing, a wealthy eccentric, the widow of a well-known essayist. On this visit they meet Aunt Emily's ward, Stephen, a quarrelsome and handsome semi-educated 19-year-old. For some reason—perhaps just to make malicious mischief—Aunt Emily wants Rickie and Stephen to get to know each other. The two young men do not take to each other at all, and quarrel. Yet it turns out that they are in fact half-brothers, a long-kept secret that Aunt Emily reveals to Rickie, mostly to shock him. Rickie assumes that Stephen is the illegitimate son of his father—a father he hated—who lived apart from Rickie's mother during Rickie's childhood. Illegitimacy in this period is considered to be a blight on the child, as well as the family, and Agnes, who is essentially conventional, considers Stephen's existence something to be deeply ashamed of and to be kept secret, and Stephen a person who deserves to be shunned.\n\nHer brother, Herbert, has received an offer to be the head of a dormitory at Sawston School, and can fill this post only if Agnes and Rickie marry quickly and join him, Agnes to be house mother, and Rickie to be a teacher of classics. Rickie's ambition to be a writer, and his freedom of thought, are suppressed by the dreary regimen of teaching, and his moral sense is suffocated by the influence of his wife and brother-in-law. He becomes a petty tyrant in the classroom, and an insensitive enforcer of school rules, though a part of him still sees and understands what he has lost, both as a writer and a man of refinement and sensitivity, since Cambridge. He is \"dead\" to his former friend, Stewart Ansell, who refuses to answer Rickie's letters. Ansell finally does pay a visit to Rickie, stopping at the house of another acquaintance, and by coincidence he meets Stephen, who (partly due to Agnes's scheming to get Aunt Emily's inheritance for Rickie and herself) has been expelled from Mrs. Failing's house. Stephen has discovered his identity at last, and now knows that Rickie is his half-brother. He wants to meet him again and see whether they might get on better. Ansell falls under the spell of Stephen's rustic honesty, physical vitality, and impulsiveness. Rickie, Agnes and Herbert assume Stephen has come to blackmail them and Agnes offers him money, but Stephen, who is in fact penniless, now wants nothing to do with them. In a horrifying blowout, in front of all the pupils, Ansell accuses Rickie and Agnes of wanting to deny Stephen's existence. Ansell reveals to Rickie that Stephen is, in fact, his mother's illegitimate child, not his father’s. Rickie faints at this revelation.\n\nRickie’s marriage has become loveless, as Ansell assumed it would, and with his brother's reappearance he realises that he has fallen under his wife's spell and denied his better nature. He leaves to find Stephen, dear to him now because he is the child of the same beloved mother, and he attempts unsuccessfully to assume the role of a brother, for example, to get him to stop drinking. The two of them go to Wiltshire to see his aunt. This brief period when they travel together restores to Rickie the sense of himself that has been lost ever since he fell under his wife's influence, and, as well, restores his sense of joy and playful love of life. Rickie is unable, however, to control his mercurial half-brother, who gets drunk despite his promise not to. Like his mother, and like Gerald, Rickie dies suddenly: his legs are severed when he tries to pull a drunken Stephen off some railway tracks.\n\nStephen survives, marries, and in a brief epilogue stands up to Herbert Pembroke for his right to money that is due him with the publication of his half-brother’s book of stories, now valuable since, after his death, Frederick Elliot has become a noted author. The \"longest journey\" which is the span of one’s life, or, in another sense, the development into one’s true self, has concluded successfully for Rickie, who has regained his sense of integrity. Though his life is cut short, he receives his vindication by coming to moral clarity at last, rejecting conventional hypocrisy, and acknowledging his bond to his brother. His uniqueness and worth are confirmed as well by his posthumous success as an artist.\n\nThe phrase \"the longest journey\" appears in Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"Epipsychidion\":\n<poem>\nI never was attached to that great sect\nWhose doctrine is, that each one should select\nOut of the crowd a mistress or a friend,\nAnd all the rest, though fair and wise, commend\nTo cold oblivion, though it is in the code\nOf modern morals, and the beaten road\nWhich those poor souls with weary footsteps tread,\nWho travel to their home among the dead\nBy the broad highway of the world, and so\nWith one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe,\nThe dreariest and longest journey go.\n</poem>\n\nForster mapped out a loose plot in July 1904 after meeting a shepherd boy whilst walking in Wiltshire. He spent the first half of 1906 working on the novel. Returning to Weybridge from abroad in October 1906, Forster worked to complete it.\n\nCritically \"The Longest Journey\" is the most polarizing of Forster's novels. The novel was well-reviewed but had disappointing sales when first released; it is most often viewed as a minor work compared to Forster's later novels. However, even in Forster's lifetime there was reassessment of the novel's quality, with literary critic Lionel Trilling calling it \"...perhaps the most brilliant, the most dramatic, and the most passionate of his works.\" According to Margaret Drabble both the structure and the uncharacteristically high death count which occurs later in the book confuse fans of Forster's. Gilbert Adair wrote that the greatest weaknesses for readers is its \"unrelenting intellectuality, its sublimation and even outright repression of the importance of the erotic in human relationships\" and the \"...not always intentional priggishness of its characters\", which he saw as constituting a poignant quality.\n\n\n"}

Studying abroad is determined in the United States by political rationales of national security and foreign policy. The number of students studying abroad represents only about 1% of all students enrolled at institutions of higher education in the United States.\n\nWhile the majority of foreign students who study in the United States are pursuing a full degree, most outgoing U.S. students study abroad for one or two academic terms. The majority of US students now choose short-term study abroad programs according to the most recent Institute of International Education Open Doors Report. In the 2008–09 academic year, the five countries US students chose to study abroad in most were the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France, and China. The total number of US students studying abroad during 2008–2009 was 260,327, compared to 262,416 the previous year, a modest decline of 0.8%. In the 2011–2012 academic year 283,332 US students opted to study abroad, a 0.9% increase from 2008–2009; however, US students who choose to study abroad represent only 1% of all students enrolled in higher education institutions. The Open Doors report is published annually by the Institute of International Education with funding from the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. However, the report found that there were notable increases in the number of U.S. students going to study in less traditional destinations. Fifteen of the top 25 destinations were outside of Western Europe and nineteen were countries where English is not a primary language.\n\nIn 2012, 764,495 international students studied in the United States. During the same time period, 274,000 US students studied abroad. This imbalance has been referred to as an \"international education deficit\".\n\nWhile the data from the Open Doors Report is still wide-ranging, it is not entirely inclusive of all study abroad student data that had previously been included in the annual reports. As of 2013, according to the Open Doors' FAQs regarding the question of 'Who is counted in the U.S. Study Abroad survey?': \"students who travel and take courses abroad that are not tracked by their home institution are not reported in Open Doors, nor are students who are enrolled overseas for full degrees from non-U.S. institutions.\"\n\nThe University of Delaware is credited with creating the first study abroad program designed for U.S. undergraduate students in the 1920s.\n\nA few decades later, Professor Raymond W. Kirkbride of the University of Delaware, a French professor and World War I veteran, won support from university president Walter S. Hullihen to send students to study in France in their junior year. UD initially refused to fund Kirkbride's travels, and he and Hullihen appealed to prominent public and private figures for support including then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover and businessman Pierre S. du Pont. Kirkbride set sail for on July 7, 1923, with eight students for six weeks of intensive language courses in Nancy, France, before moving on to Paris to study at The Sorbonne. The Delaware Foreign Study Plan, which came to be known as the Junior Year Abroad (JYA), was considered a success and was replicated by other U.S. institutions such as Smith College. In 1948, the Delaware Foreign Study Plan was discontinued due to post-war conditions in Europe and shifting priorities under a new university president. It has since been re-instated in the form of their current study abroad program.\n\nDespite flat overall study abroad numbers, there were notable increases in the numbers of U.S. students going to some of the less traditional destinations for study abroad in 2008/09. Double digit increases to host countries among the top 25 destinations include Argentina, Chile, Denmark, the Netherlands, Peru, South Africa and South Korea. Double-digit decreases among the top 25 host countries include Mexico (which experienced H1N1 virus outbreak that year), Austria and India.\n\nThe following table represented the top 25 studied abroad destinations for U.S. students seeking academic credited in 2007/08 and 2008/09, according to the Institute of International Education.\n\nIn 2013/14, 886,052 international students studied at U.S. colleges and Universities.\n\nAccording to NAFSAs website, \"the number of U.S. students studying abroad for credit during the 2013-2014 academic year grew 5.2 percent from 289,408 students to 304,467 students. This represents just under 1.5 percent of all U.S. students enrolled at institutions of higher education in the United States and about 10 percent of U.S. graduates. A recent survey found that almost 40% of companies surveyed missed international business opportunities because of a lack of internationally competent personnel. When 95% of consumers live outside of the United States, we cannot afford to ignore this essential aspect of higher education.\"\n\nSee the following chart displaying their most recent study done on the percentage of United States abroad students by their race/ethnicity.\n\nIt has been shown that through study abroad, students can gain a better understanding of themselves, and of their culture. They improve their ability to evaluate elements of their own culture in an unbiased manner. It has also been shown that students who study abroad are more appreciative of their own culture and not just the culture that they visited. Some even say studying abroad can become a \"reverse culture shock\" with the differences of students when they return to their own culture. In addition, multicultural interactions become smoother and more natural for the students for the rest of their lives. It has been shown that 96% have increased self-confidence, 97% feel more mature and 98% understand their own values more clearly. Research suggests that when paired together, the use of social media and study abroad programs make second language acquisition much less difficult. Michele Back, Assistant Professor of World Languages Education at the University of Connecticut, conducted research on the positive influence Facebook has on second language acquisition for students participating in study abroad programs. Her work demonstrated that students who used Facebook to interact with native speakers, before and after their study abroad experience, found it easier to maintain long term interactions in their target language—further enhancing their second language acquisition.\n\nDespite the slight decline in U.S. students studying abroad for credit in 2008–2009, study abroad is likely to continue to grow. The number of outgoing U.S. students pursuing overseas study has increased over fivefold since the late 1980s, from less than 50,000 students to more than 260,000 in 2008–09. Behind the numbers, though, has been the proliferation in the type study abroad programs. According to Lilli Engel of the American University Center of Provence, there are fundamental differences in the academic and cultural experience offered by study abroad programs today that suggest the need to create a level-based classification system for program types. In an influential Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad article, she compares \"a one-month summer term, requiring little or no host language proficiency, with subject-matter classes in English, collective housing and American roommates\" with \"a full-year program for students of advanced linguistic proficiency housed individually in a host family and directly enrolled in local university courses or engaged in a professional internship or service-learning project.\"\n\nMotivation, interaction and their connection to developing a second-language was examined by Todd A. Hernández of Marquette University. In terms of language acquisition, there is more to learning a language than just the assumption \"that study abroad is superior to home education...\". It is the interaction of the individual with the option of various opportunities, the exchange of language and ideas across cultures and the interpersonal connections established within various social settings. When these characteristics are pursued in Study Abroad, many researchers have found the \"this sustained interaction is an important improvement in a Study Abroad context... contributing to language gain.\"\n\nYet, within international education, a universally accepted method of classifying study abroad programs has proven elusive. U.S. students can choose from a wide range of study-abroad opportunities differentiated by program sponsor, curriculum, cost, program model, language and degree of integration, to name a few. While study abroad in the U.S. is by no means uniform, study abroad programs can reasonably be grouped according to (a) duration, (b) program model (c) program sponsor.\n\nStudy abroad programs are available to students throughout the year. However, the majority enroll in Semester or Summer programs (37.3% and 35.8%). Even though the total number of outbound U.S. students grew by over 100,000 from 2000/01 to 2008/09, the percentages of students studying abroad during a given term remained largely stable. However, the long-term trends of steadily relatively fewer students signing up for Academic Year programs in favor of growing enrollments in programs less than 8 weeks during the Academic Year. For working and community college students study abroad can also last as short as a week.\n\nDuration of U.S. Study Abroad (% of Total), 1999/00 - 2008/09\nFour basic models have been identified to refer to a study abroad program's structure. They consist of (a) Island, (b) Integrated, (c) Hybrid, and (d) Field-study programs.\n\n\nPrograms can also be grouped and classified by identifying a program's sponsor. Sponsors are the institutions and/or circumstances that led to a program's creation, as well as what the goal of a program is. The main study abroad program sponsors are (a) host university (direct exchange and direct enroll), (b) U.S. college or university (study centers and international branch campuses), and (c) study abroad organizations known as third-party providers.\n\nHost University Sponsor: direct exchange and direct enroll\n\nMany U.S. institutions have long-standing direct exchange partnerships with foreign institutions that allow their students to enroll in classes as a visiting student while still paying standard tuition at their home university. Direct exchanges are facilitated by agreements governing academic credit transfer and financial aid between the home university and host university. While individual agreements may vary, direct exchange typically involves a 1:1 where the number of inbound exchange must be equivalent to the number of outgoing study abroad students. Typically, students enroll in standard courses at the host institution and are fully integrated with host country students and are responsible for their own housing, airport transfer, etc. Programs are administered on-site by the host university, with pre-departure advising and assistance from a U.S. university study abroad office.\n\nLike direct exchange, direct enrollment programs are generally geared toward the more independent student, as participants enroll in courses directly alongside local students. Students are responsible for their housing and coordinating other logistics. Unlike direct exchanges, direct enrollment does not necessarily require an agreement between the U.S. institution and the foreign university. As such, credit transfer is not automatic and participants pay tuition and fees directly to the host university.\n\nSponsored by U.S. College and Universities: study centers and international branch campuses\n\nSome of the most popular study abroad programs include those sponsored by a student's home institution, by another U.S. college or university, or by a consortium of U.S. colleges or universities. These programs are designed to allow students to study in a foreign environment while remaining within a U.S. academic framework. Credit transfer is arranged by the sponsoring and programs typically align with traditional U.S. academic calendars. The U.S. sponsor institution will typically assist with housing arrangements, and may arrange cultural activities and excursions for participating students. Study center are known as \"island programs\" because create separate classes and spaces for U.S. and foreign students.\n\nParticipants may take classes at a study center or international branch campus run by the U.S. college or university sponsor. The curriculum of study centers are specifically designed for study abroad students. For example, students at Texas Tech University's Seville, Spain program study with TTU faculty, take TTU courses with other TTU students and earn TTU credit. International branch campuses, however, are distinct in that U.S. study abroad students enroll in classes alongside full degree-seeking students. As an example, Florida State University Panama Canal Branch offers a broad curriculum and the majority of its students are Panamanian or are from other countries in Latin America, notably Colombia and Costa Rica. Today, U.S. colleges and universities operate at least 80 international branch campuses worldwide.\n\nSponsored by third-party providers\n\nThird-party providers are private companies and organizations that sponsor study abroad programs. Both for-profit and non-profit third-party providers assist program participants with logistics like course registration and housing arrangements. While models differ, academic and social guidance is generally included throughout the duration of a program, as are built-in excursions and community service opportunities.\n\nThird-party providers of all stripes pursue relationships with U.S. universities in the form of affiliation agreements or membership consortia agreements. There are many third-party providers in operation in the United States.\n\nCosts for a study abroad program include, but are not limited to tuition and fees, room and board, medical insurance, passport and visa fees and transportation costs. While U.S. universities vary in terms of policies related to financing study abroad, financial aid for U.S. students who wish to study abroad may include a combination of scholarships, grants from the home university, government student loans, and private student loans.\n\nAn amendments made in 1992 to the Higher Education Act of 1965, TITLE VI, SEC. 601-604 in the U.S. ruled that students can receive financial aid for study abroad if they are enrolled in a program that is approved by their home institution and would be eligible to receive government funding without regard to whether the study abroad program is required as a part of the student's degree.\n\n\n\n\nStudy Abroad Scholarships from third party providers and host institutions are another common source of funding for students.\n\nIn mid-2007, New York's attorney general opened an inquiry into the relationships between universities and providers of foreign study. According to Benjamin Lawsky, former deputy counselor in the office of Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, the inquiry was to focus on whether cash incentives and other perks that foreign-study providers give universities influence their decisions about where students may study. Critics contend that the practices, rarely disclosed and largely unknown, limit study abroad options and drive up the price that is ultimately passed onto students. The investigation follows disclosures in The New York Times that providers of study abroad are offering colleges rebates, free and subsidized travel, unpaid seats on advisory boards, help with back-office services and marketing stipends. In some cases, perks are tied to the number of students universities send to a given provider's program. When asked, Lawsky said that the inquiry grew out of his office's inquiries into similar practices in the student loan industry.\n\nAs part of the investigation, Cuomo's office issued subpoenas for five of the major study abroad providers in August 2007. The first batch of providers were the Institute for Study Abroad at Butler University, the American Institute For Foreign Study, the Institute for the International Education of Students; the Center for Education Abroad at Arcadia University, and the Danish Institute for Study Abroad. Six months later, he issued subpoenas or requests for documents top 15 colleges in and out of New York State. In light of the unprecedented attention on the industry, drafted a report in early 2008 calling on U.S. university study abroad offices to be more open in their decision making and to demonstrate that their policies directly benefit students.\n\nAlso in response to Cuomo's investigation, The Forum on Education Abroad released a code of ethics in March 2008 that sought to be a \"compass\" for U.S. universities, study abroad providers and foreign host institutions. Unlike the NAFSA report, The Forum document offers a broad set of ethical principles and detailed guidance. It recommends, amongst other things, that U.S. institutions have specific procedures for reporting payments, like honoraria and consulting fees, for work done on behalf of providers; that agreements and criteria for selecting study abroad programs be disclosed fully; and that the goals and parameters for visits by campus officials to overseas program sites be clearly established in advance of the trips. The Forum is a consortium of American and overseas colleges and outside providers founded in 2001 to create standards of good practices for education abroad.\n\nWhile focus is often placed on the \"romantic\" experience of visiting another culture in discussions about the benefits of study abroad, there has been some research that shows that study abroad experience has a quantitatively positive net effect on students. A study conducted from 2006-2010 showed that—during a period when only 49% of the average population of college graduates found a job within one year of graduation—98% of students with study abroad experience had found employment within one year. Students with study abroad experience reported starting salaries 25% higher than the general student population.\n\nIn China, study abroad in United States is increasingly popular in the present society. Many of them carry on the purpose of acquiring higher and better education in American universities. The number of Chinese students has increased in recent years. In just three years, the number of Chinese students has tripled to near 40,000, making them the largest group of foreign students at American universities. According to Kun and David (2010), “Traditional Chinese culture places well-educated scholars in the highest social rank. Academic achievement is also an honour to the family. Dedication to scholarship becomes not only a personal goal but also a culture goal for Chinese international students. During 2014-2015, China was the first in the world from which students are coming to U.S for studying and china is by far the largest student exchange in U.S during these years. Chinese students prefer to study in the US because US education focuses on quality education instead of quantity education followed by Chinese system. The reason is that China is one of the developed countries in the world and mostly students from wealthy and middle-class families can easily fund their education and bear the expense of visa and education in the US. Hence they can easily settle there and carry out their education without problems.\n\nThe number of Indian students in the United States grew from 148,360 in March 2015 to 194,438 in March 2016, a jump of 31.1%, according to the latest 'SEVIS by the Numbers' report. This is second only to China. Also, Indian Students contributed $5.01 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015-16 according to the Open Doors data 2016.\n\n\n"}

The trunkline runs through a rural section of Leelanau County, connecting two villages with the county seat. Originally a gravel road in 1933, it was later paved within the first three years of existence. Segments were realigned to straighten curves in the late 1930s and early 1970s near the villages of Lake Leelanau and Suttons Bay.\n\nM-204 starts at an intersection with M-22 (Manitou Trail) south of Leland next to Duck Lake. From there it follows Duck Lake Road along the south shore of Lake Leelanau's northern lobe. The two-lane roadway runs eastward and then southeasterly through a mixture of woods and fields to the village of Lake Leelanau. One there, M-204 follows Phillip Street across the Narrows and turns northeasterly. The bridge that the trunkline uses is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Outside of town, the highway follows Duck Lake Road again past the county seat of Leelanau County. Near the intersection with Horn Road, M-204 turns southeasterly toward the village of Suttons Bay. As the trunkline descends a hill into the village, it passes through vineyards and woods. Inside town, M-204 follows Race Street and ends downtown at M-22 (St. Joseph Avenue).\n\nLike other state highways in Michigan, M-204 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 3,397 vehicles used the highway daily in Suttons Bay and 2,931 vehicles did so each day near the western terminus, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of M-204 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nM-204 was first designated on July 12, 1933 between Leland and Suttons Bay along what is today Duck Lake Road. The highway was paved by the middle of 1936. The road was realigned on July 13, 1939, across the narrows of Lake Leelanau in the village of the same name. Another realignment near Suttons Bay was completed on March 26, 1956, to smooth out a curve in the road. A second completed on May 4, 1956, straightened a curve by Sylt Road east of Lake Leelanau. The western section was completely rebuilt between Duck Lake Corner and the Lake Leelanau Narrows Bridge to smooth out curves in the roadway. Sections not obliterated by the reconstruction were turned over to local control as Main Street or Old M-204 in Lake Leelanau when the project was finished on July 1, 1970.\n\n"}

It tells the story of an introverted young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who is sent to live with his eccentric great-uncles (Robert Duvall and Michael Caine) on a farm in Texas.\n\n14-year-old Walter is left by his irresponsible mother, Mae, to live for the summer with his reclusive, bachelor great-uncles, Hub and Garth. Despite living on a ramshackle Texan farm, they are said to have a secret fortune and are made the target of every traveling salesman. They, in turn, sit on their porch with shotguns, shooting at the salesmen.\n\nWalter is given a room in the attic and is not welcomed at first, until they realize he annoys other gold-digging relatives who visit with their children. For his part, Walter persuades his uncles to try spending some of their money, generally with disastrous results. Packets of seeds to plant a vegetable garden turn out all to be corn. Then they order a lion for an animal target and end up with an aging, tame, retired circus lioness, which they turn over to Walter as a pet. Later, she is released by accident and takes to the cornfield, which becomes her new \"jungle\" home. While loading 50-pound bags of Lion Chow, Hub passes out and is taken to the hospital. On leaving, they encounter four greasers at a roadside store who draw switchblade knives on Hub, but are easily beaten by him in a fight.\n\nA subplot develops around the photograph of a beautiful woman that Walter finds in the attic. In a series of flashbacks, Garth tells Walter the story of their African past, during which Hub fell in love with an Arab princess named Jasmine (after whom Walter names the lioness) who was promised to a powerful Sheik. After Hub and Jasmine married, the Sheik put a price on Hub's head, keeping them in constant peril from assassins. Finally Hub won a duel against the Sheik but spared his life, warning him to cease the manhunt. When Walter asks to hear more from Hub, his uncle reveals that Jasmine and their baby died in childbirth. Hub then returned to the French Foreign Legion, until he retired with Garth to their farm, where they are resignedly waiting to die. Walter asks Hub for confirmation, since his mother always lies to him. Hub responds with a piece of his \"What Every Boy Needs to Know...\" speech, that the actual truth is not as important as \"belief\" in ideals. Walter then asks Hub to promise to be around to give him the rest of the speech when he's old enough and Hub grudgingly agrees.\n\nLate one evening, Walter trails Garth and discovers they have a room filled with money underneath the barn. On another night, Walter's mother and her current boyfriend, a supposed \"private investigator\" named Stan, arrive. While the uncles sleep, Stan and Mae demand that Walter reveal the location of his uncles' fortune, claiming they were actually bank robbers. When Walter chooses to believe in his uncles instead, Stan pins Walter down and begins beating him. Jasmine, sensing Walter in danger, emerges from the cornfield and attacks Stan. Awakened by the ruckus, Hub and Garth find the old lioness has died of heart failure defending her “cub”.\n\nThe next day, Walter leaves with his mother. Once on the road, Mae explains that Stan will be staying with them to recuperate, but Walter asks her instead to \"do something that's best for me for once\" and abandons her. While Hub and Garth are delighted to see him back, Walter insists there have to be changes: His uncles must involve themselves in his education and live carefully, as he wants them to die of old age.\n\nSeventeen years later, Walter is alerted by the sheriff of his uncles' deaths from a failed flying stunt with their biplane. Arriving at the farm, he is given his uncles' will, declaring \"The kid gets it all. Just plant us in the damn garden, with the stupid lion.\" A helicopter bearing the logo \"Sahara Petroleum\" then touches down near the homestead and a man steps out with his young son, explaining that he heard about Hub and Garth's deaths on the radio. He had recognized the names as the two Americans in tales told to him in his youth by his grandfather, \"a very wealthy sheik\". When the man's young son asks Walter if his uncles really lived, Walter confirms, \"Yeah. They \"really\" lived.\"\n\n\nDirector Tim McCanlies, who was an admirer of cartoonist Berkeley Breathed, wrote requesting work of his to feature in the film. Breathed sent the drawings of a strip called \"Walter and Jasmine\", which is presented as the work of the grown-up Walter, and they also accompany the final credits.\n\n"}
{"id": "1863170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863170", "title": "Clitic doubling", "text": "Clitic doubling\n\nIn linguistics, clitic doubling, or pronominal reduplication is a phenomenon by which clitic pronouns appear in verb phrases together with the full noun phrases that they refer to (as opposed to the cases where such pronouns and full noun phrases are in complementary distribution).\n\nClitic doubling is found in many languages, including Albanian, Aromanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Degema, Greek, Persian, Romanian, Somali, Italian, and Spanish.\n\nThe conditions on clitic doubling vary from language to language, generally depending on well-known properties of the objects along the animacy hierarchy (allowing, requiring, or forbidding clitic-doubling for different kinds of objects). In this regard, clitic doubling for objects can be viewed as a species of differential object marking.\n\nSpanish is one well-known example of a clitic-doubling language, having clitic doubling for both direct and indirect objects. Because standard Spanish grammatical structure does not draw a clear distinction between an indirect object and a direct object referring to a person or another animate entity (see Spanish prepositions), it is common but not compulsory to use clitic doubling to clarify. Compare:\n\nIn such constructions, the indirect object can be expressed both as a full noun phrase and as a clitic in order to note that the noun phrase beginning with \"a\" (to) should be understood as an indirect object:\n\nThe above, if literally translated into English, would be redundant:\n\nThis usage is highly preferred for many verbs, but for some verbs it is not compulsory, and it would also be valid to say: \"\"Siempre ofrezco café a mis invitados\"\", without clitic doubling.\n\nSimilarly, the direct object may also be doubled, with both the direct object pronoun and the full noun phrase, but this is not as common as indirect clitic doubling and is usually influenced by definiteness, animacy, and specificity.\n\nOne particular use is to clarify emphatic structures:\n\nIn Italian, clitic doubling can be used for emphasis, is often viewed as a colloquial pleonasm, and is considered \"incorrect\" by many prescriptive grammarians.\n\nExample: \"a me mi pare di sì\" (\"I [personally, for what I am concerned] think so\")\n\nIn Iloko, a third person pronoun must co-occur with the full noun phrase to which it refers when 1) the noun phrase is the agent of a transitive verb and a pronoun is the patient, or when 2) the noun phrase is the possessor and a pronoun is the thing possessed. The appropriate fused personal pronoun is used and the number of its third person component must agree with the noun phrase.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"NOT:\" *Nakitaak ni Maria.\n\n\"NOT:\" *Nakitaak da Maria ken ni Juan.\n\n\"NOT:\" *Anakka dagiti Rizal.\n\nIn Lombard, clitics are widely used with both nouns and pronouns.\n\nTe gh'el diset ti a la Rina che l'è staa luu?\nWill you tell OR Would you mind telling Rina it was him [who did it]?\n\nIn Venetian, clitics usually double the second singular person subject and third singular and plural subject.\n\nThe above, if literally translated into English, would be redundant:\n'My parents come tomorrow'\n'Marco comes tomorrow'\n'You come tomorrow'\n\nInterrogative subjects clitics double also other subjects. They attach to the verb:\n'Do you (pl.) sing as well?'\n\nAccusative clitics double first and second singular/plural direct object\nIn some varieties of the language, also dative clitics may double and indirect object, even of third person:\nIn the standard Macedonian language, clitic doubling is obligatory with definite direct and indirect objects, which contrasts with standard Bulgarian where clitic doubling is optional. Non-standard dialects of Macedonian and Bulgarian have differing rules regarding clitic doubling.\n\nClitic doubling occurs in Degema, as it does in Romance and Slavic languages. However, clitic doubling in Degema is not associated with the presence of a preposition as in Romance languages like Spanish nor is it associated with topicality or specificity as in Slavic languages like Bulgarian. Rather, what make clitic doubling in Degema possible are syntactic (movement and anaphoricity) and discourse (emphasis and/or familiarity) factors (Kari 2003) Consider (1) below:\n\n(1) Eni mo=sire\n\nIn (1) the subject noun phrase (NP) 'Eni' is doubled by the clitic 'mo='. The clitic agrees in person, number and case with the doubled subject NP.\n\nExample (2) shows that specific and non-specific subjects in Degema can be doubled by a clitic:\n\nExample (3) shows that both topicalized and non-topicalized NPs in Degema can be doubled by a clitic:\n\nIn Degema, the preposition does not feature in clitic doubling constructions in particular and in cliticization in general. Although there are object NPs such as indirect object NPs that can cooccur with a preposition, there are no corresponding object clitics to double them, unlike subject NPs.\n\nKari (2003: 135f) adds that \"syntactic factors are stronger than discourse factors in the licensing of clitic doubling in Degema. Discourse factors only ensure the expression or suppression of the doubled NP after syntactic operations have taken place\".\n\n\n"}

The final two (which have been renamed) are still in service, albeit in warmer waters.\n\nAn earlier ship named \"Innisfallen\" was built at Blyth, Northumberland, England, in about 1863. She sank with the loss of eight lives in the English Channel in the vicinity of the Goodwin Sands in a storm at the end of November 1897, on a voyage from South Shields to Cowes. She was carrying a cargo of gascoal when she sank.\n\nThe first \"Innisfallen\" was built in 1896. She was torpedoed and sunk, without warning, by German U-boat on 23 May 1918, east of the Kish Light Vessel. She was on her way from Liverpool to Cork. 10 died. She had been owned by City of Cork Steam Packet Company.\n\nThe City of Cork Steam Packet Company built the second \"Innisfallen\" in 1930. City of Cork Steam Packet Company, was taken over by the Coast Lines group. They set up their Cork – Fishguard operation as “B & I Lines” (British and Irish Lines). She sailed the Dublin – Liverpool route.\n\nLeaving Liverpool on 21 December 1940, she hit a mine off the Wirral shore near New Brighton. All the passengers survived, but four crewmen were lost.\n\nThe third \"Innisfallen\" was launched in 1948 by B&I. The B&I had an advertising slogan: \"Travel the Innisfallen Way\". She was sold in 1967, to Hellenic Maritime Lines and renamed \"Poseidonia\". She was broken up at Brindisi in 1985. In 1967 the Irish Government bought B&I Lines from the Coast Lines group.\n\nThe fourth \"Innisfallen\" was launched in 1969. She sailed the Cork-Swansea route, while her sister ship, \"Leinster\", sailed Dublin-Liverpool. In 1983 all sailings from Cork were closed, as there were not enough passengers.\n\n\"Innisfallen\" was sold to Corsica Ferries who renamed her \"Corsica Viva\". There were several more changes to her name. In 2003 she was sold to Sancak Lines, Turkey, who renamed her \"Derin Deniz\". She was broken up in 2004.\n\nThe B&I Line then renamed \"Leinster\", which was also launched in 1969, as the fifth \"Innisfallen\". The new 'Innisfallen', being a deeper draught than the previous ship, now sailed Cork-Pembroke Dock. In 1986 she was sold to Strintzis Lines and was renamed \"Ionian Sun\". In 2000 Strintzis Lines renamed themselves as Blue Ferries. In 2001 she was sold to Marco Shipping Agency, Dubai, and renamed \"Merdif\".\n"}

He designed stained glass windows, furniture, embroidery, and was an illustrator of books. Image was the first Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford from 1910 to 1916.\n\nSelwyn Image was born in Bodiam, Sussex on 17 February 1849 to the Reverend John Image (c. 1802–1878), vicar of Bodiam and Mary Maxwell (\"nee\" Hinds c. 1807–1857). He attended Marlborough College and the New College, Oxford in 1868 where he studied drawing under John Ruskin. Intending on entering the clergy and following his father as Vicar of Bodiam, Image took Holy Orders at the age of 24. He was ordained deacon in 1872, and priest the next year. He was a curate at Tottenham and later at St. Anne's, Soho. Image began studying art with A. H. Mackmurdo and Ruskin's assistant, Arthur Burgess in 1880. Image eventually abandoned the clergy in 1882.\n\nHe founded the Century Guild of Artists in London with prominent architect and designer A. H. Mackmurdo. With Mackmurdo, Image established the Guild's workshops which produced furniture, wallpaper, primarily domestic design such as furniture, stained glass, metalwork, and decorative painting. Image was co-editor of the Guild's magazine, \"The Hobby Horse\", from 1886 to 1892. He was an active member of the Art Workers' Guild in London and became a Master of the guild in 1900..\n\nOne of Image's first stained glass designs, \"The Seasons\", manufactured by James Powell & Sons, was exhibited at the Paris International Exhibition in 1878. Image's designs were influenced by the work of William Morris. Image's early designs, composed of individual figures against a floral background, was inspired by Morris's previous work. Image described one of Morris & Co. earliest stained glass commissions, one of a pair of two-light windows (1862) depicting the four archangels at St. Michael and All Angels church in Brighton 'as one of the finest modern windows I know of.'\" The early window, designed by Ford Madox Brown was the inspiraton for Image's \"Archangel\" window at Mortehoe.\n\nThe basis of Image's stained glass design was a \"simplicity of treatment, not only in figure drawing and ornament—which closely match his contemporary graphic work, such as for the Century Guild The Hobby Horse—but also in the use of leading. In an article published in The Hobby Horse in 1890, Image expounded his principles of stained glass design, emphasizing that qualities of 'richness and brilliance of effect...in no small measure depend upon the management of the leads'\".\n\nImage and well-known stained glass artist, Christopher Whall met in the 1880s and became lasting friends. Whall and Image were among the earliest pioneers and important contributors to the Arts and Crafts Movement. Image designed fewer than thirty windows during his career, but a number of cartoons (designs) were displayed at Arts and Crafts Exhibitions. Several of Image's designs were illustrated in books and magazines where Image acquired a wide following. Christopher Whall included one of Image's cartoons in his influential manual \"Stained Glass Work\" (1905), \"as an example of the 'simple and severe' style of drawing best suited to the medium.\"\n\nImage was influential in the work of a number of stained glass artists, including two women: Mary J. Newill (1860–1947) and Helen Coombe (1864–1937). Mary J. Newill was a talented artist-craftsman who trained at the Birmingham Municipal School of Art in the 1880s and 1890s. Helen Coombe (1864–1937) was a student of Image at the Slade School of Fine Art and her design for the \"Mary and Martha\" window was displayed at the 1896 Arts and Crafts Exhibition and showed the influence of Image as artistic mentor.\n\nImage was an influential writer on design and the first Slade Professor of Fine Arts at Oxford from 1910 to 1916.\n\nBetween December 1887 and February 1888, Image gave a series of four lectures on Modern Art at Willis' Rooms. Oscar Wilde attended at least one of this series, and reviewed the second lecture in the \"Sunday Times\" on 25 January 1888.\n\nImage published a number of essays, contributed introductions and chapters to scholarly publications, and published a poetry collection, \"Poems and Carols\" in 1894.\n\nImage's line-block design for the cover of the inaugural 1884 issue of the Hobby Horse, the Guild's publication, is widely known. Other celebrated works include the design of embroideries for the Royal School of Needlework and bookbindings such as that for the novel Stefania (1893)\".\n\nIn 1900, Image was hired as a designer for the Glasgow furniture manufacturer, Wylie and Lochead.\n\nImage died at Holloway on 21 August 1930. Two years after his death, selected poems and later his letters, edited by Mackmurdo was published.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863187", "title": "Rabbi Ishmael", "text": "Rabbi Ishmael\n\nRabbi Yishmael ben Elisha (Hebrew: רבי ישמעאל בן אלישע), often known as Rabbi Yishmael and sometimes given the title \"Ba'al HaBaraita\" (Hebrew: בעל הברייתא), was a rabbi of the 1st and 2nd centuries (third generation of tannaim).\n\nHe was a descendant of a wealthy priestly family in Upper Galilee. His year of birth was 90 CE. He was captured by the Romans as a young boy, but redeemed by R' Joshua ben Hananiah. R' Nehunya ben HaKanah became his teacher, and he remained a close colleague of Rabbi Joshua. He is likely the grandson of the high priest of the same name. He lived in Kfar Aziz, south of Hebron.\n\nSome suppose that he was among the martyrs of Betar. The more generally received opinion, however, is that one of the martyrs was a namesake (Rabbi Ishmael's death is mentioned in \"Nedarim\" ).\n\nAccording to tradition, his burial place is at Parod in the Galilee.\n\nYishmael's teachings were calculated to promote peace and goodwill among all: \"Be indulgent with the hoary head;\" he would say, \"and be kind to the black-haired [the young]; and meet every man with a friendly countenance\". \n\nWhat he taught he practised. Even toward strangers, he acted considerately. When a non-Jew greeted him, he answered kindly, \"Your reward has been predicted\"; when another abused him, he repeated coolly, \"Your reward has been predicted.\" This apparent inconsistency, he explained to his puzzled disciples by quoting : \"Cursed be one who curses you, and blessed be one who blesses you\".\n\nHe was fatherly to the indigent, particularly to poor and plain maidens, whom he clothed attractively and provided with means, so that they might obtain husbands. \n\nOne Friday night, while absorbed in the study of the Bible, he inadvertently turned the wick of a lamp; and he vowed that when the Temple was rebuilt, he would offer there an expiatory sacrifice.\n\nYishmael opposed the refusal of the ultra-patriotic to beget children under the Roman sway. Even under the conditions then existing, he recommended early marriage. He said, \"The Scripture tells us, 'Thou shalt teach them [the things thou hast seen at Horeb] to thy sons and to thy sons' sons;' and how may one live to teach his sons' sons unless one marries early?\"\n\nYishmael gradually developed a system of halakhic exegesis which, while running parallel with that of Rabbi Akiva, is considered the more logical of the two. Indeed, Yishmael established the principles of the logical method by which laws may be deduced from laws and important decisions founded on the plain phraseology of the Scriptures. Like Akiva, he opened up a wide field for halakhic induction, but, unlike Akiva, he required more than a mere jot or a letter as a basis for making important rulings.\n\nYishmael was of opinion that the Torah was conveyed in the language of man, and that therefore a seemingly superfluous word or syllable cannot be used as a basis for new deductions. In discussing a hypothetical case with Akiva, he once exclaimed, \"Wilt thou indeed decree death by fire on the strength of a single letter?\" He considered the plain sense of the Scriptural text, irrespective of its verbal figures, to be the only safe guide.\n\nTo consistently carry out his views in this direction, Ishmael formalized a set of 13 hermeneutic rules by which \"halakha\" was derived from the Torah. As a basis for these rules he took the seven rules of Hillel, and on them built up his own system, which he elaborated and strengthened by illustrating them with examples taken from the Scriptures. Even these rules, he would not permit to apply to important questions, such as capital cases in which no express Scriptural warrant for punishment existed; he would not consent to attach a sentence of death, or even a fine, to a crime or misdemeanor on the strength of a mere inference, however logical, where no such punishment is clearly stated in Scripture or to draw a rule from a law itself based on an inference. His rules were universally adopted by his successors, \"tannaim\", as well as \"amoraim\", although occasionally he himself was forced to deviate from them.\n\nHe had a reputation for greatness in aggadah. Yishmael laid the foundation for the halakhic midrash on Exodus, the Mekhilta; and a considerable portion of the similar midrash, the Sifre on Numbers, appears also to have originated with him or in his school, known as \"Debei R. Ishmael\".\n\nRegarding the question of whether future punishment will be limited to the spirit or to the body, or whether either one in fact merits punishment (since neither can sin when separated from the other), Ishmael draws the following parallel:\n"}

The original house was built by George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, in 1589, created in the Elizabethan style.\n\nIn 1643, the last Earl, Henry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland died. His only child, Lady Elizabeth Clifford, had married Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Cork, and thus the property passed to the Boyle family. In 1664, Richard Boyle was also created 1st Earl of Burlington. Robert Hooke was engaged to enlarge the house and lay out formal gardens, between 1679 and 1683. Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, who was the principal patron of the Palladian movement in England, and himself a noted architect, had alterations made to Londesborough, undertaken by William Kent in the 1720s.\n\nOn the 3rd Earl's death without a male heir, in 1753, Londesborough passed to the Dukes of Devonshire, along with all his other properties, as his daughter, Lady Charlotte Boyle, had married William Cavendish, soon to be the 4th Duke of Devonshire. In 1819, the 6th Duke of Devonshire, who had a superfluity of grand homes, a large running debt inherited from his father, and many other expensive interests to pay for, including his reconstruction of Chatsworth House, had Londesbrough demolished. He is said to have regretted this, and in 1839, he had a hunting box built on the estate, but in 1845, under mounting financial strain, he sold the whole Londesborough estate to the \"Railway King\", George Hudson. A private railway station (Londesborough Park) was built on the adjacent York to Beverley line for Hudson to use.\n\nHudson's questionable financial practices soon brought about his ruin, and in 1849, he sold Londesborough to the politician, Albert Denison, who was created Baron Londesborough in 1850. Denison enlarged the hunting box to create a country house in the Victorian style. His son, William Denison, later became the Earl of Londesborough.\n\nThe Victorian house survives in the ownership of Dr and Mrs Ashwin, who also own the Londesborough estate.

AmCham is the largest foreign business organization in Taiwan, with more than 1,000 members representing over 500 companies across a diverse array of sectors. Membership in AmCham Taipei does not require U.S. citizenship. AmCham is a founding member of APCAC. The Chamber's monthly journal is \"Taiwan Business TOPICS\".\n\nAn elected Board of Governors oversees AmCham, and chooses one of its members to serve as Chairman for a one-year term. The Board also hires a president to guide the overall direction and manage the day-to-day affairs of the Chamber. The current president is Bill Foreman.\n\nAmCham Taipei represents its diverse membership in government advocacy efforts, provides a forum for networking and access to information, and encourages civic-minded participation in the greater Taiwan community.\n\nMuch of AmCham's advocacy efforts begin in one of 24 committees, whose fields of activity range from Agro-Chemical, Banking, and Manufacturing to Education & Training, Public Health and Travel & Tourism. Most committees formulate a priority issues paper included in the \"Taiwan White Paper\".\n\nEach year, AmCham publishes a white paper that summarizes AmCham's recommendations to the government and public on legislative, regulatory and enforcement issues that have a major impact on the quality of the business environment. The primary purposes are information and advocacy. The paper assesses the Taiwan business climate on both the macro level and sector by sector. It provides a review of the status of last year's priority issues, states the current issues identified by AmCham's industry-specific committees, and offers recommendations to the U.S. government.\n\nThe Chamber's flagship publication provides year-round reporting and policy analysis in support of Chamber advocacy. First issued in 1969, TOPICS has become the definitive voice on the Taiwan business climate for executives, government officials, the media, and academics. The magazine appears monthly and enjoys widespread distribution to prominent officials, elected representatives, and think tanks in the United States and Taiwan. The June issue is devoted to the \"Taiwan White Paper\".\n\nAn AmCham tradition since 1970, the Hiseh Nien Fan banquet is an opportunity to thank Taiwan government officials for their assistance in the previous year. Customarily, the president of the country is the keynote speaker.\n\nOnce a year, an AmCham delegation meets with senior officials in the U.S. Administration and on Capitol Hill to discuss international business concerns regarding U.S.-Taiwan trade and commerce.\n\nAmCham registered with the Taipei City Government on 14 September 1951. The heads of five U.S. companies—three trading companies and the oil companies Caltex and Standard Vacuum (the precursor of both Exxon and Mobil)—joined together originally to lobby Washington to open Taiwan's procurement of equipment, raw materials, and commodities to U.S. private companies.\n\nAfter this early success, AmCham grew, with early members including Eli Lilly, Mattel, Timex, and distributors for U.S. motion pictures. By the 1960s, the Chamber was developing into an active professional organization: In 1967, it held its first formal breakfast meeting; in 1968, it became a founding member of the new Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers (APCAC); and in 1969, AmCham published the first issue of its bimonthly magazine, now called \"Taiwan Business TOPICS\".\n\nU.S. companies played an important role in laying the groundwork for Taiwan's later economic achievements in the consumer electronics, computer, semiconductor, and flat panel display industries.\nGeneral Instrument's decision in 1964 to set up a subsidiary on the island to make various electronic components was a pioneering investment that prompted other major U.S. electronics companies to follow suit and laid the groundwork for Taiwan's entry into consumer electronics, which eventually led to the production of computers, semiconductors, and flat panel displays. General Instrument grew into one of Taiwan's biggest employers; by 1980, it had 10,000 workers.\n\nAmerican firms also helped advance Taiwan's 10 Big Projects, which in the 1970s provided the infrastructure foundation for the island's future economic prosperity. For Taiwan's first international-standard freeway—the Sun Yat-sen Freeway stretching from Keelung to Kaohsiung—U.S. engineering companies helped to conduct feasibility studies, design several sections, and provide construction engineering and inspection. Numerous American companies, including Amoco Chemical, Mesta Machine, General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, and U.S. Steel Corp., provided Taiwan's first integrated steel mill and its new petrochemical complex with investment, procurement, training, and engineering consultation.\n\nAmerican firms like Texas Instruments and Varian Associates were early entrants into the Hsinchu Science Park. Established in 1980 and inspired by the Stanford Research Park that nurtured Silicon Valley, Hsinchu has helped foster the development of some renowned global technology companies.\n\nFollowing the shock of U.S. derecognition of Taiwan, AmCham Taipei's leadership played an instrumental role in determining the form of the continued U.S. relationship with Taiwan.\n\nIn 1976, under the chairmanship of Marinus “Dutch” van Gessel, AmCham made the strategic decision not to oppose the improvement of U.S. relations with mainland China—as long as it was not done at the expense of Taiwan. Van Gessel had previously served as Deputy Assistant Secretary in the U.S. Department of Commerce and by 1976 was heading up the Taiwan operations of Corning Glass. Concerned with giving due consideration to the potential impact on U.S. business interests of any change in U.S. diplomatic relations, in January 1977, van Gessel wrote a paper entitled \"The U.S. and the ROC: A Businessman’s View—A Position Paper of the American Chamber of Commerce in the ROC\". The document laid out many of the principles later incorporated in the Taiwan Relations Act, the law passed by Congress in 1980 that has formed the basis of U.S. relations with Taiwan ever since. \nVan Gessel also testified before a Congressional committee in 1977, and he organized a letter-writing campaign to Congressional offices and others in Washington to argue that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's security was not only a military and diplomatic issue, but also crucial to the stability of the business environment.\n\nThe Shanghai Communique of 1972 made clear that the U.S. and China intended to normalize relations. Nevertheless, the timing of President Carter's announcement of derecognition of the R.O.C. in December 1978 caught Taiwan, and the American business community there, by surprise. According to the Chamber, \"AmCham did not object to U.S. recognition of the PRC \"per se\", but strongly objected to the terms of the agreement and to the discourtesy of the lack of proper advance notice to Taiwan.\"\n\nRobert P. Parker (AmCham chairman in 1979 and 1980) played a key role in helping to reaffirm U.S. friendship with Taiwan. In February 1979, he represented AmCham in testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the “Omnibus Legislation” that had been drafted by the U.S. State Department and proposed by the Carter Administration as the basis for future unofficial relations with “the people of Taiwan.”\n\nIn his remarks, Parker emphasized that “normalization” jeopardized American economic interests in Taiwan and offered specific proposals for correcting the proposed legislation's failure to provide adequately for the security of Taiwan from threat or use of coercion from mainland China, as well as failure to offer a clear and sufficient legal framework for the continuation of U.S.-Taiwan relationships sufficient for continued trade and investment. \nParker noted that the prompt enactment of these specific proposals “would not only be in the interest of American business, [but also] necessary to meet our country’s moral responsibilities to Taiwan and its people.”\n\nThe final version of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) saw virtually all of AmCham's principal recommendations written into law.\n\nIn the wake of the official switch of U.S. diplomatic relations, uncertainty surrounded the potential impact on Americans and other foreign residents in Taiwan. As the U.S. embassy in Taipei wrapped up its operations, AmCham stepped in to serve as the main conduit for communication with the Taiwan authorities to preserve or establish needed expatriate community organizations.\n\nAmCham worked to establish International Community Radio Taiwan (ICRT) to replace the Armed Forced Network Taiwan (AFNT), which stopped broadcasting English-language news, entertainment, and vital emergency information on typhoons and earthquakes. The departure of the U.S. military also risked leaving a gap in social and recreational programs. The Chamber helped to create the Taipei Youth Program Association to provide recreational opportunities for expat children, and arranged for a new and larger location for the American Club in China (ACC). The Chamber also secured the legal status of the Taipei American School, then the sole large-scale institution of international education on the island.\n\nIn January 2002, Taiwan acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the name of Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. In 2008, Taiwan signed the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) under the WTO and began regularly scheduled cross-Strait direct air service. Committed to the easy flow of people, goods, services, and investment, AmCham lobbied hard for these developments.\n\n"}

WARH is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting and airs an Adult Hits radio format. The studios and offices are in Creve Coeur, Missouri (although a St. Louis address is used). The transmitter is located near Resurrection Cemetery off Mackenzie Road in St. Louis.\n\n\"106.5 The Arch\" using the primary slogan \"You never know what we're going to play next.\" The station's name pays tribute to the iconic Gateway Arch monument in Downtown St. Louis on the western bank of the Mississippi River. The format is musically similar to the syndicated Jack FM stations in the U.S. & Canada. However, \"The Arch\" uses a live and local DJ staff around the clock, whereas \"Jack\" stations are for the most part automated with no live voices.\n\nWARH broadcasts in HD. The HD1 signal carries the adult hits format. WARH-HD2 carries co-owned KTMY from Minneapolis, known as \"My Talk Radio.\" Before March 2017, it featured less familiar rock songs from the 1960s to the present, branded as \"106-5 The Deep.\" \n\nOn November 24, 1965, WGNU-FM first signed on. It was the FM counterpart of AM 920 WGNU, under the ownership of Chuck Norman. Both stations simulcast a country music format for Granite City and its surrounding communities. Norman sold the FM station to Doubleday Broadcasting in 1977. Doubleday boosted the station's signal to cover most of the St. Louis radio market. The call sign was changed to WWWK, with the station simulcasting the album oriented rock (AOR) format of AM 1380 KWK (now KXFN). The stations called themselves \"Stereo WK.\"\n\nIn November 1986, the two stations were bought by Chase Broadcasting. The simulcast ended in 1987, with AM 1380 becoming Oldies WGLD, while FM 106.5 (now with the call sign KWK-FM) moved to a Top 40/Hot AC format.\n\nIn 1988, KWK-FM became WKBQ-FM, retaining the Top 40/Hot AC format but switching to the handle \"Q106.5.\" In September 1991, WKBQ-FM brought the morning team of \"Steve & DC\" to St. Louis from Birmingham, Alabama. In 1993, \"Steve & DC\" and WKBQ-FM would face controversy over comments made during the May 10th morning show and was the subject of much local news coverage for weeks. Also in 1993, WKBQ-FM again was simulcast on AM 1380.\n\nIn late 1993, WKBQ-FM was purchased by Zimmer Radio Group of Cape Girardeau, Missouri. On January 20, 1994, it switched dial positions with sister station 104.1 FM WKKX (currently WHHL), which had a country format known as \"Kix 104\" (with the AM simulcast also moving with the swap). The station became \"New Country Kix 106.5,\" with the popular morning duo \"Steve & DC\" heard for the second time on the 106.5 MHz frequency. That led to the team scoring its biggest ratings in St. Louis. The \"Steve & DC\" morning show consistently ranked #1 in the all-important Persons 18-49 and Persons 25-54 demographics on WKKX.\n\nIn November 1996, Emmis Broadcasting bought Kix 106.5. But in 2000, Emmis swapped WKKX to Bonneville International Broadcasting for Los Angeles country music station KZLA (now KLLI). At 12:00 a.m. on October 4, 2000, the first day Bonneville owned the station, it changed call letters to WSSM and adopted a Smooth Jazz format as \"Smooth 106.5\" (later \"106.5 Smooth Jazz\"). The Smooth Jazz format lasted five years.\n\nOn April 10, 2005, after playing \"Thank You\" by Euge Groove, the station adopted its current adult hits format, branded as \"106.5 The Arch.\" The first song on \"The Arch\" was \"Roll With the Changes\" by REO Speedwagon. The station adopted its current WARH call letters on April 18. WARH was initially programmed by Jules Riley. The Program Director since 2016 is Scott Roddy, who also serves as the P.D. for sister station 92.3 WIL-FM.\n\nOn January 19, 2011, Bonneville announced the sale of WARH, as well as 16 other stations in four markets (St. Louis, Chicago, Cincinnati and Washington, D.C.), to Minneapolis-based Hubbard Broadcasting. The sale was completed on April 29, 2011. Hubbard has kept the adult hits format in place, which continues as one of St. Louis' top ten stations.\n\n"}

These properties are storativity (S), specific storage (S) and specific yield (S).\n\nThey are often determined using some combination of field tests (e.g., aquifer tests) and laboratory tests on aquifer material samples. Recently, these properties have been also determined using remote sensing data derived from Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar.\n\nStorativity or the storage coefficient is the volume of water released from storage per unit decline in hydraulic head in the aquifer, per unit area of the aquifer. Storativity is a dimensionless quantity, and is always greater than 0.\n\nFor a confined aquifer or aquitard, storativity is the vertically integrated specific storage value. Specific storage is the volume of water released from one unit volume of the aquifer under one unit decline in head. This is related to both the compressibility of the aquifer and the compressiility of the water itself. Assuming the aquifer or aquitard is homogeneous:\n\nFor an unconfined aquifer, storativity is approximately equal to the specific yield (formula_5) since the release from specific storage (formula_4) is typically orders of magnitude less (formula_11).\n\nThe specific storage is the amount of water that a portion of an aquifer releases from storage, per unit mass or volume of aquifer, per unit change in hydraulic head, while remaining fully saturated.\n\nMass specific storage is the mass of water that an aquifer releases from storage, per mass of aquifer, per unit decline in hydraulic head:\n\nwhere\n\nVolumetric specific storage (or volume specific storage) is the volume of water that an aquifer releases from storage, per volume of aquifer, per unit decline in hydraulic head (Freeze and Cherry, 1979):\n\nwhere\n\nIn hydrogeology, volumetric specific storage is much more commonly encountered than mass specific storage. Consequently, the term specific storage generally refers to volumetric specific storage.\n\nIn terms of measurable physical properties, specific storage can be expressed as\n\nwhere\n\nThe compressibility terms relate a given change in stress to a change in volume (a strain). These two terms can be defined as:\n\nwhere\n\nThese equations relate a change in total or water volume (formula_33 or formula_2) per change in applied stress (effective stress — formula_32 or pore pressure — formula_36) per unit volume. The compressibilities (and therefore also S) can be estimated from laboratory consolidation tests (in an apparatus called a consolidometer), using the consolidation theory of soil mechanics (developed by Karl Terzaghi).\n\nSpecific yield, also known as the drainable porosity, is a ratio, less than or equal to the effective porosity, indicating the volumetric fraction of the bulk aquifer volume that a given aquifer will yield when all the water is allowed to drain out of it under the forces of gravity:\n\nwhere\n\nIt is primarily used for unconfined aquifers, since the elastic storage component, formula_4, is relatively small and usually has an insignificant contribution. Specific yield can be close to effective porosity, but there are several subtle things which make this value more complicated than it seems. Some water always remains in the formation, even after drainage; it clings to the grains of sand and clay in the formation. Also, the value of specific yield may not be fully realized for a very long time, due to complications caused by unsaturated flow. Problems related to unsaturated flow are simulated using the numerical solution of Richards Equation, which requires estimation of the specific yield, or the numerical solution of the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation, which does not require estimation of the specific yield.\n\n\n\n"}

It was among the last offences that were punishable by execution in the United Kingdom. The crime was created by the Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 (12 Geo. 3 c.24) passed by the Parliament of Great Britain and was designed to protect Royal Dockyards and vessels from arson attacks.\n\nIt remained one of the few capital offences after reform of the death penalty in 1861, and remained in effect even after the death penalty was permanently abolished for murder in 1969. However, it was then eliminated by the Criminal Damage Act 1971.\n\nThe Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 was passed in order to protect Royal Navy ships, dockyards, and stores from damage. At the time, ships were built of flammable oak wood and tar, and the naval yards were full of these supplies. Punishment for violating the act was a death sentence. The first section created the offence of arson in the royal dockyards by making it an offence to burn or destroy Royal Navy ships, stores, or ammunition under penalty of death anywhere in the British Empire. The Act also provided that benefit of clergy was not an available defence for the crime. The second section also stated that offenders could be tried if the offence occurred anywhere outside of the realm. The act put a version of arson in statute law for the first time, as all arson previously had been under common law. Though Scotland had its own similar offence of wilful fire raising.\n\nAt the time of the Act's passage, the death penalty was common; at the turn of the 19th century, 220 offences carried the death penalty. In 1861, Parliament passed the Offences against the Person Act 1861, as part of a series of criminal law consolidation acts, which sharply limited the death penalty to only five civilian crimes: arson in royal dockyards, murder, treason, espionage, and piracy with violence.\n\nOnly one prosecution was brought under the Act. In that case, the Scottish saboteur John the Painter (also known as James Hill or John Aitken) was prosecuted and executed in 1777 for setting the rope house at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard on fire. He was hanged from the mizzenmast of the frigate , the highest gallows erected in British history, with the frigate moored at Portsmouth Royal Dockyards in view of the damage he had caused. A crowd of 20,000 gathered to witness the hanging.\n\nThe death penalty for murder was abolished in 1969, leaving the provisions of the Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 as one of the few crimes that retained the death penalty.\n\nIn 1970, the Law Commission proposed that the crime of arson in royal dockyards be abolished in its draft Criminal Damage Bill as part of an update of the law on criminal damage. The reasoning was that the law was no longer required for its original purposes, as warships were no longer made of flammable materials. The resulting Criminal Damage Act received royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II in 1971 and the offence of arson in royal dockyards was abolished. In a speech in the House of Lords in 1998, Lord Goodhart stated that the dockyard arson offence disappeared from the list of capital crimes in 1971 \"without, so far as I am aware, either comment or concern.\"\n\nThe Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998 abolished the death penalty for all remaining crimes.\n\nDespite abolition in the United Kingdom, a 2004 episode of the comedy quiz show \"QI\" asserted that it is still popularly and erroneously believed that arson in royal dockyards continues to exist as a capital offence. Though similar crimes have occurred since abolition, they are now dealt with under general laws relating to arson.\n\nA 1975 report for the Australian state of Victoria found that the Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 was still apparently in force, as the sections of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 that repealed the Dockyards Act explicitly applied only to the United Kingdom. However, the offence of arson in royal dockyards is considered obsolete in Victoria, as the provisions have been superseded by the Victorian Crimes Act 1958 and the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914–1973. New South Wales also retained it, as it was viewed as being \"ultra vires\" for the Parliament of New South Wales to amend it.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar had the act incorporated into its law in the English Law (Application) Act 1962. Thus, the offence was retained in Gibraltarian law; however, section two was repealed in 1972.\n\nUntil 2007, the act remained on the statute books in the Republic of Ireland, as British statutes formed a part of Irish law following the Kingdom of Ireland's absorption into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. It was fully repealed under schedules two and three of the Irish Statute Law Revision Act 2007.\n\n"}

The trials, which were held within the walls of the former Dachau concentration camp, were conducted entirely by American military personnel whose legal authority had been conferred by the Judge Advocate General's Department within the U.S. Third Army. Dachau was established on 10 March 1933 in Dachau, roughly 12 miles North of Munich, and was liberated on 29 April 1945. The Dachau trials were held at Dachau Concentration Camp due to the camp having the facilities to hold the trials, and also because many of those prisoners who had worked there were confined to the premises.\n\nThe Dachau Military Tribunal's chief prosecutor was 32 year-old William Denson, a U.S. Army lawyer. The chief defence counsel was Lieutenant Colonel Douglas T. Bates Jr., an artillery officer and lawyer from Centerville, Tennessee.\n\nThe trials started in November 1945 and were adjourned in December. They were held by the American Military Tribunal, without a jury, but instead by a panel of seven men, one of whom was versed in international military law. The prosecution was different from most trials, in that the burden of proof was on the defense. The charges to be carried out by the United States Military were against Germans such as camp guards, some SS units and medical personnel, who had taken part in war crimes against allied nationals. The Dachau Trials consisted of 465 trials from not only the Dachau concentration camp, but also Flossenbürg concentration camp, Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex, Nordhausen concentration camp, Buchenwald concentration camp, and Mühldorf concentration camp complex and consisted of four main categories of charges: main camp offense, subsidiary camp offenses, atrocities against downed fliers, and then a catchall category mainly consisting of details about the Malmedy Massacre. On December 13, 1947 when the trials adjourned, roughly 1200 defendants had been tried with roughly a 73% conviction rate. \n\nUnlike the International Military Trials in Nuremberg that prosecuted the major Nazi war criminals under the jurisdiction of the four Allied Occupying Powers, the Dachau tribunals were held exclusively by the United States military between November 1945 and August 1948. The proceedings were similar to the 12 post-1946 Nuremberg trials that were also conducted solely by the United States.\n\nAll the hearings were held within Dachau because it was, at the time, the best known of the Nazi concentration camps and it would act as a backdrop for the trials by underlining the moral corruption of the Nazi regime.\n\nDuring almost three years, the American military tribunals tried 1,672 German alleged war criminals in 489 separate proceedings. In total 1,416 former members of the Nazi regime were convicted; of these, 297 received death sentences and 279 were sentenced to life in prison. All convicted prisoners were sent to War Criminals Prison #1 at Landsberg am Lech to serve their sentences or to be hanged.\n\nTwo of the most highly publicised trials concerned the activities of German forces during the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944. In the Malmedy massacre trial, 73 members of the Waffen-SS were found guilty of summarily executing 84 American prisoners of war during the attack. In another trial, former German commando Otto Skorzeny and nine officers from the Panzer Brigade 150, were found not guilty of breaching the rules of war contrary to the Hague Convention of 1907 for wearing American military uniforms in a false flag operation, Operation Greif.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The onset of his breakdown was described as follows:\n\n'Men and beasts passed through the haze, black outlines; a troup of mules with Indian driver was a stately silhouette; shambling after them a bucket-carrying menial with tousled turban and bedraggled shirt flapping round flexed knees was an immortal grotesque, raised above the plane of human need and anxiety. The Platonic Idea, as interpreted by Schopenhauer, the basis of art. Removed from all appeal to the will, the horrible was transmuted into the beautiful. He was, in fact, a sanitary man staggering back from a punishment fatigue; constantly in trouble, he would incur more fatigues, with stoppages of pay, staggering in the bog of inefficiency under implacable authority. '\n\n'...I looked along the river banks - tents and incinerators, horses and mules, soldiers, native and European, a complex of endeavour in an enterprise as unreal as all the day-to-day needs and anxieties and discomforts, ambitions and humiliations of each individual, were real.'\n\n'Unreal? The word came back to me as a sudden illumination. That was it, it was all a staged show.'\n\nThe delusions which accompanied this insight were hardly more absurd than the futilities of war.\n\nHis other books were a biography of Martin Luther, a travel guide to Belgium and a history of the Rothschild family. \"Salvation Dynasty\" was Brian Lunn's account of the Salvation Army's founders.\n"}

The weapon was developed in the late 1990s and was first seen publicly in September 2001. It has been selected to replace the 7.62 mm MG3 general-purpose machine gun in the Bundeswehr at the squad support level; it will complement the MG3 in other roles. The MG4 will also be the secondary armament of the new Puma infantry fighting vehicle. Overall, it is designed to be light, provide maximum safety to the user and function reliably under adverse conditions using a wide range of ammunition from different manufacturers, without the need to adjust the gas system. The machine gun was initially known as the MG43 prior to its adoption by the Bundeswehr.\n\nThe MG4 is an air-cooled, belt-fed gas-operated light machine gun with a positively locked rotary bolt and is somewhat similar in concept to the Belgian Minimi light machine gun. Safety mechanisms on the machine gun includes a manual safety incorporated into the fire mode selector toggle; setting the fire selector lever on the \"safe\" position blocks the trigger mechanically and locks the bolt in the cocked position. When the bolt is not pulled back completely, accidental firing is prevented by an integral, automatic mechanism that prevents the bolt from traveling forward. In addition, the firing pin cannot reach the cartridge primer until the cartridge has been fully chambered.\n\nThe machine gun is fed from a disintegrating belt and is carried out in two stages from the top left using an enhanced pawl mechanism. As on the MG42 family of machine guns, the belt is expelled to the right and spent cases are ejected downwards, although sideways ejection to the right is an option.\n\nThe MG4 has a hammer-forged quick-change barrel that can be safely exchanged when hot without the need for protective gloves; the carrying handle serves as the barrel change grip. The barrel assembly weighs . To reduce the overall length of the weapon for transport, the butt stock can be folded to the left side of the receiver. With the buttstock folded the MG4 remains fully operable. A field cleaning kit is housed within the stock. The MG4 takes zero shifts between barrel assemblies into account by making the front sight of the assemblies mechanically adjustable. \nIn its standard form, the MG4 is equipped with closed type iron sights with range settings up to in increments. The folding front sight element is mounted on the barrel assembly and is adjustable mechanically for both windage and elevation. The sight line radius is . Optical or night sights or laser pointers can be mounted on a length of MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail located on the receiver feed tray cover. Bundeswehr models are equipped with telescopic sights with 3× magnification.\n\nA folding bipod weighing is provided. Supporting interfaces are integrated into the receiver to allow the MG4 to be mounted on the standard American M122A1 tripod for increased accuracy and stability.\n\nThe Heckler & Koch MG4 (HK123) light machine gun is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and has been adopted by the Bundeswehr.\n\nAn export variant of the MG4 that has been slightly modified and is slightly lighter. The letter \"E\" in the designation stands for \"Export\". It has a different gas assembly that reduces the cyclic rate of fire. In 2007, the Spanish Army adopted this variant as their standard light machine gun. The Spanish Military of Defence ordered 1,800–2,000 of these light machine guns.\n\nA variant of the MG4 configured for use as a vehicle or coaxial machine gun. It lacks a buttstock, rear sight, cartridge case deflector, handguard, and bipod mount. It can be fitted with a remote firing device and safety/fire selector lever. It can also be fitted for dismounted use.\n\nA variant of the MG4 with a shorter barrel.\n\nAn export variant of the MG4K.\n\nThe Heckler & Koch MG5 (HK121) general-purpose machine gun is chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge and has been adopted by the Bundeswehr. It is based on the MG4, however there are only few parts that are interchangeable due to the machine guns having different calibers and their size differences.\n\n\n\n"}

The Nintendo DS/Game Boy Advance version of this game, \"American Sk8land\", features Wi-Fi capabilities. It was the first third-party DS game to have online support.\n\nIn the additional Collector's Edition, two exclusive characters and two exclusive levels have been added, this also includes a \"Making of Tony Hawk's American Wasteland\" documentary.\n\n\"American Wasteland\" is the first game in the \"Tony Hawk's\" franchise that advertised and allowed the possibility for players to play in one vast level via story mode, which actually seamlessly connects a number of levels without loading times in between, along with also being the first game in the series that allows to freely commandeer stray bicycles and perform freestyle BMX techniques similar to skateboarding. A new maneuver, the Bert Slide, was added to skateboarding controls. In the September 2005 edition of \"Game Informer\", a map was shown displaying \"American Wasteland\"s Los Angeles with an insert of an overhead view of the Boston stage from \"Underground 2\" for comparison. The Boston level appeared to be about three quarters the size of one \"American Wasteland\" area, with the exception of the \"Vans Skatepark\" and \"Casino\" areas.\n\nThe game begins with the skater (one of five chosen pre-designed male skaters) boarding a bus to Los Angeles, hoping to get away from the sub-par life in his hometown. Upon arrival in Hollywood, skateboarding punks steal the player's bag after he gets off of the bus. A local skateboarding enthusiast named Mindy helps the player up and offers to help him change his look to fit in better. After a change in wardrobe, the player is quick to reclaim his bag, but Mindy insists that if he is to fit in, he needs to improve his skating skills, and has some local friends, Ian and Duane, teach him some tricks. Eventually, the player confronts one of the punks and challenges them to a skating contest for his bag, which the player wins. Still, the punk tries to run off, but the player beats them with his board and reclaims his bag. The player meets back up with Mindy, who reveals she is an artist working on creating her own skating zine, named \"American Wasteland\", that she hopes to publish someday. The player then sees a sketch of an awesome local skate park called the \"Skate Ranch\", and begs Mindy to take him there. Mindy explains that it's a \"local's only\" spot, but agrees to show the player anyway, and after clearing up a protest blocking their way, the two head to the ranch's entrance in Beverly Hills.\n\nThere, the player meets Mindy's skater friends: Boone, Useless Dave, and Murphy, who deny the player entrance due to being an outsider, but decide that if they can impress them, they'll allow the player entry. With help learning more skills from local skaters, the player proves his skills to the group and is let in. He meets the leader of the group, Iggy VanZandt, a rough type who isn't fond of outsiders. Iggy is also initially hostile to the player, but allows them to crash at the ranch after he gathers wood to help finish his half-pipe. While Iggy skates the half-pipe, the player notes Iggy's skating skills, with the group revealing that Iggy was a professional skater back in the day, but couldn't handle the publicity and dropped out of the public eye. After Iggy compliments the player's work on the half-pipe, Mindy comes up with an idea to fix the ranch up and make it into a full-on skatepark, which the rest of the group is enthusiastic about. With the help of Murphy's contacts, the group embark on obtaining skate-able pieces from all over L.A.\n\nFrom here on in, the overall task is to obtain pieces for the skate ranch, unlocking new areas in L.A. along the way. Eventually, the player participates in the Tony Hawk AmJam, an amateur skating contest taking place in the Vans Skatepark downtown. He wins the AmJam and is interviewed by Tony Hawk, who asks where he learned a unique trick he used during the contest. The player explains he learned it from Iggy VanZandt, prompting confusion from Tony who claims that, \"he's been M.I.A. for years\". When the player returns to the ranch, however, Iggy is being arrested. Iggy reveals he was living in secrecy to avoid the police for a number of minor offenses until the player publicly revealed at the contest he is still alive. Wanting to make amends for getting Iggy in jail, Mindy suggests the player seek out Iggy's old friends, the Z-Boys, for help. After making his way to Santa Monica, the player meets skating legend Tony Alva, who agrees to help them out if he can prove his old-school skating skills. After impressing Alva, the player learns of Iggy's history with the Z-Boys, and Alva shows the player an old photo of \"Green Pipes Point,\" a legendary snake run that got filled in many years ago. However, the player recognizes Green Pipes Point as being Iggy's ranch. When the player decides to have it dug up, Alva suggests meeting with his friend Mega, an oil rig worker, who is quick to assist in digging up the snake run. \n\nWhile Mega works on digging up GPP, the player learns from Mindy that Boone has been kidnapped by his old street gang and needs rescuing from East L.A., but the gang in question, the Black Widowz, controls passage through the only tunnel leading to the area, prompting the player to join the gang to be allowed entry. After passing the initiation tests, the player successfully joins the Widowz and makes his way to East L.A., eventually rescuing Boone and grabbing new pieces for the ranch once there. When Mega finishes digging up Green Pipes Point, the player gets a phone call from Iggy in jail. When the player explains the restoration of GPP, Iggy is furious; he explains that he doesn't own the land, nor does he have enough money to buy it himself, and that once publicity of GPP hits, the real owner will sell it. Sure enough, the real owner locks up the ranch and makes plans to sell it. Iggy returns to the now locked up skate ranch enraged, the player apologizing to no avail. Their tempers flare and Iggy punches out the player for the trouble they've caused, who then snaps at Mindy, claiming her desire to improve the ranch caused all of this to happen. Mindy storms off, but when the player tries to apologize as she leaves, Murphy, Dave, and Boone take him away to discuss something important.\n\nThe group informs the player that Tony Hawk is currently in the area, believing that if they can convince him and other local pros to be in a \"Save Green Pipes Point\" video, they can sell the video online, and use the proceeds to save the ranch from the auction block. The player then rounds up several pros throughout L.A., including pro BMX rider Mat Hoffman for the video. Iggy later catches up with the group and reconciles with the player about their argument, also assuring him that Mindy will eventually forgive them for their argument as well. The group then learns of a vacant casino in East L.A., and decide to trash it as the finale for the video. They eventually succeed, as Murphy informs the group that the video has made enough money to buy the ranch back through online pre-orders alone. Leaving the casino, the group are met by the police. The player manages to evade them, skating all the way through the city back to the ranch with the casino footage unscathed. The player arrives to the completed American Wasteland, which Iggy now owns thanks to the success of the video. To celebrate, he throws a party at the ranch, with everyone in town invited. At the party, the player apologizes to a returning Mindy, who accepts their apology and shows off the first edition of her newly published magazine, \"American Wasteland\", with the player on the cover. Iggy then reveals to Mindy that the player helped publish it using the funds for the video; she is flattered and the two kiss.\n\nThe \"American Wasteland\" soundtrack features a lineup of punk-based bands, each covering a song from a classic punk rock or hardcore punk group, the album features all 14 previously-unreleased covers that were recorded for the game. The soundtrack reached number 148 on The Billboard Top 200, number 4 on Billboard Top Soundtracks, and number 10 on Billboard Top Independent Albums. The cover art is a homage to the cover of the 1979 album \"London Calling\" by The Clash which, in turn, is a homage to the cover of Elvis Presley's first album. The back cover art is a homage to the back cover art of self-titled album of The Clash. IGN gave the soundtrack a 4.1/10, stating that the soundtrack is aimed towards emo-lovers instead of punk.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews, with the general consensus being that the advertisement of Los Angeles being \"one big level\" as opposed to the previous games' series of levels was false, since the \"one level\" was a series of levels accessible from one another via bland corridors that simply masked the necessary loading times. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot took note of how \"shockingly easy\" the game was compared to previous entries in the series, and how \"most of the game feels like a tutorial\", adding that \"the game really seems bent on holding your hand every step of the way.\" although others have viewed this in a light that showcased the game's hefty amount of possibilities, tricks, and techniques that the player character can perform in comparison to previous games. Many critics also noted the general lack of evolution in the series, although many saw this as a good thing since the original gameplay was so popular to begin with and didn't need unnecessary tampering.\n\nMany critics praised the game on its story. Chris Roper of IGN praised Neversoft's decision to \"go back to its roots and make a game about skating\" as opposed to \"the chaos and destruction of the Underground games.\" Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot stated \"the saving grace of the story mode is that the story it tells is actually pretty good. It follows the standard 'ragtag group of misfits' struggles to save the place they call home from evil real estate moguls' plot that drove such classic films as \"\".\" Adding that \"along the way, the characters become a little endearing\".\n"}
{"id": "1863251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863251", "title": "Athlon 64 X2", "text": "Athlon 64 X2\n\nThe Athlon 64 X2 is the first native dual-core desktop CPU designed by AMD. It was designed from scratch as native dual-core by using an already multi-CPU enabled Athlon 64, joining it with another functional core on one die, and connecting both via a shared dual-channel memory controller/north bridge and additional control logic. The initial versions are based on the E-stepping model of the Athlon 64 and, depending on the model, have either 512 or 1024 KB of L2 Cache per core. The Athlon 64 X2 is capable of decoding SSE3 instructions (except those few specific to Intel's architecture).\n\nIn June 2007, AMD released low-voltage variants of their low-end 65 nm Athlon 64 X2, named \"Athlon X2\". The Athlon X2 processors feature reduced TDP of 45 W. The name was also used for K10 based budget CPUs with two cores deactivated.\n\nThe primary benefit of dual-core processors (like the Athlon 64 X2) over single-core processors is their ability to process more software threads at the same time. The ability of processors to execute multiple threads simultaneously is called thread-level parallelism (TLP). By placing two cores on the same die, the X2 effectively doubles the TLP over a single-core Athlon 64 of the same speed. The need for TLP processing capability is dependent on the situation to a great degree, and certain situations benefit from it far more than others. Certain programs are currently written for only one thread, and are therefore unable to utilize the processing power of the second core.\n\nPrograms often written with multiple threads and capable of utilizing dual-cores include many music and video encoding applications, and especially professional rendering programs. High TLP applications currently correspond to server/workstation situations more than the typical desktop. These applications can realize almost twice the performance of a single-core Athlon 64 of the same specifications. Multi-tasking also runs a sizable number of threads; intense multi-tasking scenarios have actually shown improvements of considerably more than two times. This is primarily due to the excessive overhead caused by constantly switching threads, and could potentially be improved by adjustments to operating system scheduling code.\n\nIn the consumer segment of the market as well, the X2 improves upon the performance of the original Athlon 64, especially for multi-threaded software applications.\n\nHaving two cores, the Athlon 64 X2 has an increased number of transistors. The 1 MB L2 cache 90 nm Athlon 64 X2 processor is 219 mm² in size with 243 million transistors whereas its 1 MB L2 cache 90 nm Athlon 64 counterpart is 103.1 mm² and has 164 million transistors. The 65 nm Athlon 64 X2 with only 512 KB L2 per Core reduced this to 118 mm² with 221 million transistors compared to the 65 nm Athlon 64 with 77.2 mm² and 122 million transistors. As a result, a larger area of silicon must be defect free. These size requirements necessitate a more complex fabrication process, which further adds to the production of fewer functional processors per single silicon wafer. This lower yield makes the X2 more expensive to produce than the single-core processor.\n\nIn the middle of June 2006 AMD stated that they would no longer make any non-FX Athlon 64 or Athlon 64 X2 models with 1 MB L2 caches. This led to only a small production number of the Socket-AM2 Athlon 64 X2 with 1 MB L2 cache per core, known as 4000+, 4400+, 4800+, and 5200+. The Athlon 64 X2 with 512 KB per core, known as 3800+, 4200+, 4600+, and 5000+, were produced in far greater numbers. The introduction of the F3 stepping then saw several models with 1 MB L2 cache per core as production refinements resulted in an increased yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n'64' was omitted from the name of the Brisbane 'BE' series; the 64-bit marketing campaign initiated by AMD became insignificant once essentially all consumer CPUs became 64-bit processors.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863256", "title": "Tout Va Bien", "text": "Tout Va Bien\n\nTout va bien is a 1972 French-Italian political drama film directed by Jean-Luc Godard and collaborator Jean-Pierre Gorin and starring Jane Fonda and Yves Montand.\n\nThe film's title means \"everything is going well\". It was released in the United States under the title \"All's Well\" and internationally under the title \"Just Great\".\n\nThe Godard/Gorin collaboration continued with the featurette \"Letter to Jane\" as a postscript to \"Tout va bien\".\n\nThe film centers on a strike at a sausage factory which is witnessed by an American reporter and her French husband, who is a director of TV commercials. The film has a strong political message which outlines the logic of the class struggle in France in the wake of the May 1968 civil unrest. It also examines the social destruction caused by capitalism. The performers in \"Tout va bien\" employ the Brechtian technique of distancing themselves from the audience. By delivering an opaque performance, the actors draw the audience away from the film's diegesis and towards broader inferences about the film's meaning.\n\nThe factory set consists of a cross-sectioned building and allows the camera to dolly back and forth from room to room, theoretically through the walls. Another self-reflexive technique, this particular set was used because it forces the audience to remember that they are witnessing a film, breaking the fourth wall in a literal sense. This type of staging was appropriated from Jerry Lewis's film \"The Ladies Man\". Godard and Gorin use other self-reflexive techniques in \"Tout va bien\" such as direct camera address, long takes, and abandonment of the continuity editing system.\n"}
