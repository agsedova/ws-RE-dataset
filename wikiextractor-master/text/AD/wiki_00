The episode was written by executive producer Michael Piller and Jill Sherman Donner, and was directed by Corey Allen. \n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode, Tosk (Scott MacDonald) arrives on the station and befriends Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney), but is soon pursued by the Hunter (Gerrit Graham), who follows him through the wormhole.\n\nScott MacDonald would later appear in several further roles in the franchise as well as a recurring character during of \"\". Graham, who appears in a guest role as the Hunter, had previously been considered for the main cast role of Odo. Michael Westmore designed the make-up for Tosk to resemble an alligator; his initial design for the Hunters was changed for budgetary reasons. The episode was praised by the cast and crew, and received a Nielsen rating of 12.9, placing it as one of the four most watched episodes of the first season. Critical reception was mostly positive, with critics approving of Meaney and MacDonald's performances, but disliking the formulaic nature of the plot. The episode won an Emmy Award for best make-up for a series.\n\nA damaged, unidentified vessel from the Gamma Quadrant docks at Deep Space Nine for repairs. Its reptilian pilot, identified only as Tosk (Scott MacDonald), is the first known life-form from the Gamma Quadrant to visit the station. Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) suspects Tosk is running from something, due to evidence of weapons fire on his vessel. O'Brien befriends Tosk and tries to help him repair his ship. However, Tosk attempts to steal from a weapons locker and is put in a holding cell by Security Chief Odo (René Auberjonois).\n\nUniformed aliens arrive in the Alpha Quadrant through the wormhole, beam onto the \"DS9\" promenade, and start a phaser battle with a team led by Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks). The aliens fight their way into the brig where Tosk is being held. Sisko, O'Brien and Odo enter the room as one of the aliens, the Hunter (Gerrit Graham) removes his helmet and expresses his disappointment to Tosk for capturing him alive; Tosk, it transpires, is the aliens' quarry. He commands Sisko to lower the forcefield and release Tosk, but Sisko refuses. They discuss the issue and the Hunter agrees to place the Bajoran Wormhole out of bounds for future hunts. As much as he detests this practice, Sisko believes that under the Prime Directive he must release Tosk to the aliens.\n\nAfter talking to Quark (Armin Shimerman) in his bar, O'Brien realises that he can change the rules of the hunt before Tosk is taken away by the Hunters. He lies to Odo and convinces him to release Tosk into his care, claiming it is a Starfleet, not a Bajoran matter. O'Brien escorts the Hunter and Tosk to an airlock, but the Chief has it rigged to overload, knocking out the Hunter, allowing O'Brien to help Tosk escape. In Ops, Sisko is informed about the situation and tells Odo to pursue the duo at a leisurely pace, giving O'Brien time to help Tosk escape the station with the Hunters in pursuit. Later, an angry Sisko reprimands O'Brien for his actions; the Chief expresses his surprise at not being apprehended immediately by Odo. Sisko claims that he must have slipped up and smiles wryly after O'Brien has left his office.\n\nOriginally titled \"A Matter of Breeding\", director Corey Allen said the episode intended to move away from the \"squeaky clean\" plots of \"\". After the franchise's creator Gene Roddenberry banned disagreements between characters in \"The Next Generation\", this became one of the main elements that the producers wanted to include in the new series. In the episode, this was shown by O'Brien releasing Tosk, but originally, during the teaser segment at the beginning, it was intended to show dabo girl Miss Sarda propositioning Commander Sisko. \"We had long conversations on that and ultimately came down on the conservative side, but we'd never even had that kind of conference on \"TNG\"\", Allen explained. Executive producer Michael Piller wrote the episode with writer Jill Sherman Donner, who had previous credits on television shows such as \"Magnum P.I.\"\n\nMichael Westmore designed the make-up in the episode, drawing inspiration from an alligator he saw in National Geographic magazine to create Tosk's appearance. The Hunters were initially intended to appear more alien-like, with steam rising out of their masks as they opened to reveal a demonic face with huge eyes and scaly skin. However, due to budgetary restraints, the original costume and make-up plans were scrapped and the description was revised to become \"a rather mundane humanoid face, not far off human.\" The transporter effect used by the Hunters was inspired by the science fiction film \"Metropolis\" (1927), specifically by the scene in which the robot Maria undergoes a transformation.\n\n\"Captive Pursuit\" marked the first appearance in the \"Star Trek\" franchise for both Scott MacDonald and Gerrit Graham. MacDonald appeared a week later in \"The Next Generation\" episode \"\" as Subcommander N'Vek. He would also appear in the \"DS9\" episode \"\" and the \"\" pilot \"\". In \"\", he was cast in the recurring role of the Xindi-Reptilian antagonist Guruk Dolim through the . Graham was once considered, along with René Auberjonois and Andrew Robinson, for the role of Odo, which went to Auberjonois. Robinson was later cast as Elim Garak. Graham later gained the role of Quinn, the second Q in \"Voyager\", in the episode \"\".\n\nThe episode was positively received by the cast and crew. Meaney called \"Captive Pursuit\" a \"classic Star Trek story\" and praised MacDonald's performance, naming the episode his favourite of the first season. Michael Piller said it was one of his favourite episodes of the season, while Rick Berman said it was his favourite out of the first six episodes of the series and noted that the connection between Tosk and O'Brien was \"charming\".\n\n\"Captive Pursuit\" was first released in broadcast syndication on January 31, 1993. It received a Nielsen rating of 12.9 percent, placing third in its timeslot. This was the fourth highest rated episode of the season, behind , \"Past Prologue\" and \"\". It won the Emmy Award for outstanding individual achievement in make-up for a series.\n\nKeith DeCandido gave the episode a warp factor rating of 7/10 for Tor.com, calling it a \"good, solid, well-put-together episode anchored by two excellent performances,\" despite believing the first season of \"DS9\" was weak prior to the episode \"\". DeCandido noted that \"Captive Pursuit\" was a good Prime Directive themed episode with interesting alien cultures. He described Colm Meaney as \"magnificent\", and said that Scott MacDonald gave a \"superb performance\".\n\nZack Handlen, in his review for The A.V. Club, said that the episode was formulaic, lacked substance, and was simply designed to give Meaney something to do. He praised the dynamic between Meaney and MacDonald, but said that \"while not a classic, [the episode was] entertaining enough\" and it helped to set up O'Brien's character as one to balance the complexity of some of the newer characters introduced on the show.\n\nIn 2015, Geek.com suggested this episode as a \"recommended episode\" for their abbreviated \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" binge-watching guide.\n\nThe first home media release of the episode was on VHS cassette in the United States on September 10, 1996. It was part of the initial launch of cassettes by Paramount Home Video which saw the first six episodes released and was on a single episode cassette. It was released on DVD as part of the season one box set on June 3, 2003.\n\n\n"}

This article lists some of the famous rivalries in the NBA. Rivalries are classified into three primary groups; intradivisional, interdivisional, and interconference.\n\nInterconference rivalries comprise games between opponents in different conferences. A team plays each opponent from the other conference in one home game and one away game.\n\nIntradivisional rivalries comprise games between opponents in the same division. Since the 2004–05 NBA season, there are 30 teams in six divisions of 5 teams each. Each team plays each division opponent 4 times during the regular season (twice at home, twice away) for a total of 16 games out of 82 total regular season games.\nInterdivisional rivalries comprise games between opponents in different divisions but within the same conference. A team plays against each team from the other two divisions in its conference either three or four times. The total interdivisional games an NBA team plays is 36. Conference games are often important, as a team's record in common games, as well as its overall record against its conference, are sometimes used as tiebreakers for playoff seeding at the end of the regular season. Also, many regular season opponents have met again in the playoffs, and the result of a regular season game can affect where the playoff game will be played.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2182686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182686", "title": "Talbot (dog)", "text": "Talbot (dog)\n\nThe Talbot was a type of hunting hound common in England during the Middle Ages. It is depicted in art of the period as small to medium-sized, white in colour, with short legs, large powerful feet, a deep chest with slender waist, long drooping ears, and a very long curled tail. It is shown in one well-known example at Haddon Hall with a fierce facial expression. It is now extinct but is believed to be an ancestor of the modern beagle and bloodhound. It is uncertain whether it was a scent hound (bred for the quality of its nose), a sight hound (bred for the quality of sight and speed), or a dog used for digging out quarry. Nor is it known what type of quarry it hunted, whether deer, fox, boar, etc.\n\nThe breed is said to have originated in Normandy, perhaps to have been the white St. Hubert Hound, and to have been brought to England by William the Conqueror, but this is not supported by evidence. There are no known references to the talbot as a breed of hound in Medieval French, and none have been found in English before the mid-16th century.\n\nIn Medieval times, \"Talbot\" was a common name for an individual hound, as used before 1400 in Chaucer's \"The Nun's Priest's Tale\" (line 3383), and is used as an example of a hound name in George Turberville's 1575 work \"The Noble Art of Venerie or Huntyng\".\n\nBy the 17th century it clearly existed as a breed or type. Large, heavy, slow hounds were 'talbot-like', whatever their colour, though the 'milk white' was 'the true talbot'. In his poem \"The Chase\", published in 1735, William Somervile describes the use of \"lime-hounds\" (leash hounds) on the Scottish Borders to catch thieves, obviously referring to the bloodhound and the sleuth hound, but adds that the (white) talbot was the \"prime\" example of this type of hound.\n\nThe origin of both the name and the animal is uncertain. In a quotation from about 1449, the king referred to John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury as \"Talbott, oure good dogge\", perhaps as a play on his name, or in allusion to that family's heraldic badge. In a 1445 illuminated manuscript in the British Library John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury is depicted presenting a Book of Romances to Queen Margaret of Anjou, with a short-legged and long-eared white hound standing behind him, which serves to identify him symbolically. It is very similar to a 15th-century depiction on a ceiling at Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, made following the marriage of Sir Henry Vernon (1445-1515) to Ann Talbot, daughter of John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury.\n\nThe talbot and the greyhound were, apparently, the only hounds used in English heraldry, and it could be that the talbot originated as an emblematic or heraldic hound. References to this heraldic talbot seem to be earlier than any references to a real dog. The talbot appears in many coats of arms, for instance in later ones of the Earls of Shrewsbury, in which two talbots appear as supporters.\n\nIt is quite plausible that from these beginnings the name \"talbot\" was extended to any large heavy white scent hound, and from there helped to establish a breed or type. It was certainly similar to the bloodhound (\"white\" is given as one of the colours of the bloodhound in the 16th and 17th centuries) as regards size, and as regards use to a leash-hound.\n\nAs earliest references to this dog are much later than those to bloodhounds it cannot convincingly be regarded as an ancestor of the bloodhound.\nThe talbot seems to have existed as a breed, a little distinct from the bloodhound, until the end of the 18th century, after which, like two other large breeds to which it may have been related, the Northern Hound and the Southern Hound, it disappeared. Some early dog-shows apparently offered classes for talbots, but attracted no entrants so were dropped.\n\n\"The Talbot\" (or \"Talbot Arms\") is most familiar as a name of English public houses or inns and is usually depicted on the signs as a large white hound with hanging ears, sometimes with spots. Heraldic inn signs usually displayed the arms or heraldic badges of the lord of the manor in which they were situated, who was probably the owner of the freehold interest, together with that of most other houses in the village. As the Talbot family possessed countless manors throughout England, the sign would have been well known. Such signs helped to identify the inn for the illiterate. \nAn inn called \"The Talbot\" in Iwerne Minster, Dorset, UK, showed as its sign a \"black\" dog, apparently the crest of the Bower family, who owned the manor from the late Middle Ages till 1876. The \"Talbot Inn\" in Mells, Somerset is an allusion to the arms of the Horner family of Mells Manor: \"Sable, three talbots argent\", the arms being possibly a play on the surname as hunting hounds are controlled by the blowing of horns.\n\nThe mayor and corporation of the market town of Sudbury, Suffolk, has for arms: \"Sable, a talbot hound sejeant argent on a chief gules a lion passant guardant between two fleurs-de-lys or\" (a white hound sitting erect). The crest is \"A talbot head and neck erased\". Such a hound is also used as a logo for a local school and for many local sports clubs. The dog is always depicted with its tongue protruding. This refers to Simon de Sudbury (c.1316–1381), Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England, born in the town, whose coat of arms was \"A talbot hound sejeant within a bordure engrailed\", as is visible sculpted in stone on a wall in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nThe arms of the Carter family of Castle Martin (see Carter-Campbell of Possil) include a talbot. The arms of the Earls Waldegrave have supporters of two talbots. The Talbot hound was also the symbol of Weston Road High School in the county town of Stafford, Staffordshire. It used to be used in all school stationary and was displayed as white on a navy blue background on ties and jumpers in the school uniform. It was removed when Weston Road became an academy. The talbot also appears as a supporter in the arms of the Marquess of Sligo.\n\nHampton High School, a school from the township of Hampton, from the small town of Allison Park, Pennsylvania, is the only high school in the United States that has the Talbot as its mascot.\n\n"}

He is currently the competition director for JD Motorsports.\n\nDavis began racing in go-karts at the age of eight, competing in his hometown of Gaffney around various tracks. He raced in the karts for a number of years, and finished 3rd in the World Karting Association finals at the age of 17. In 1998, Davis began racing Late Model Stock Cars in various Southeastern tracks, gaining experience and a handful of top-five finishes. He mostly competed at Myrtle Beach Speedway, Greenville-Pickens Speedway, and Timmonsville Speedway. During the 1999 season, he made three starts in the USAR ProCup Series.\n\nHe competed for Rookie of the Year in 2000 in the USAR Pro-Cup Competing in 20 events, Davis finished the season 17th in points with top ten finishes. In 2001, he finished 11th in the Southern Division points standing with eight top-ten finishes. After a part-time USAR run in 2002, he joined Premiere Motorsports to run a full-time schedule 2003. He won his first race at Smithton, Pennsylvania and finished third in the Northern Division points, thirteenth for the entire sanctioning body.\n\nDavis made his NASCAR debut in 2001 at Nazareth Speedway for Jimmy Means. He qualified the No. 52 Broadway Motors Ford Taurus in 34th place, but finished 36th after an early engine failure. In the next two races, he finished 42nd at Dover International Speedway and 40th at the Milwaukee Mile. He made the switch over to the No. 77 Gestener Ford for Moy Racing at the second Dover race, where he finished 34th after a crash.\n\nDavis made five starts in 2002. He ran the No. 77 Docutech/Gestetner Ford in his first 2002 race at Richmond, and had the best weekend of his career at the time with a 29th place start and 26th-place finish. For the rest of the season, Davis only drove the No. 0 Chevrolet for his father's race team, Davis Motorsports. In four starts, his best finish was a 24th at Memphis Motorsports Park. Davis did not race at all in 2003, due to his USAR commitments, but he played a large role as Davis Motorsports began to run full-time in the series. He worked in the shop and every now and then on the pit box, as the team made its first full season.\n\nHe raced again in 2004, starting at Indianapolis Raceway Park for his father's team, where he had a 29th-place finish, followed by a 27th at Dover and a 34th at Darlington. Davis moved to the No. 0 full-time in 2005, with RaceGirl serving as sponsor. He failed to qualify for five races, but had a career-best tenth-place run at Talladega Superspeedway, and finished thirty-first in points. He also made one start in the No. 12 Supercuts/Hot Tamales Dodge at Texas Motor Speedway for FitzBradshaw Racing, but finished in 40th due to a transmission failure. For the 2006 season, Davis attempted to race full-time. The team used former Busch Series champion Randy LaJoie to get in the race at Mexico, and at Atlanta, MacDonald Motorsports aided the Davis team with MacDonald's pit crew. Davis also took one-race deals, driving the No. 34 Sport Clips Chevrolet for Frank Cicci Racing at Darlington, the No. 43 Ollie's Bargain Outlet Dodge for the Curb Agajanian Performance Group at Dover, and at Nashville, he prepared the No. 20 Rockwell Automation car for NEXTEL Cup driver Denny Hamlin. He returned to his own car at Milwaukee, where he finished out the season. He also attempted races for Morgan Shepherd, CJM Racing, and Front Row Motorsports at the Nextel Cup level, but did not qualify for any of those races.\n\nIn 2007, Davis signed to drive for Kevin Harvick Incorporated in the No. 77 Dollar General Chevy for 13 races, sharing the car with Bobby Labonte and Kevin Harvick. Davis ran at Fontana starting 33rd but collided with Eric McClure who ironically was driving the No. 0 car that Davis drove before. He recovered to finish 30th, last on lead lap. He then made his first road course start at Mexico where he started 37th and finished 31st one lap down. He was replaced by Ron Hornaday Jr. prior to the race at Milwaukee. Shortly after that, it was announced that Davis had been released by KHI, due to Dollar General wanting only Cup drivers in the car. He ran the rest of the season in the No. 01 car fielded by his family team.\n\nFor 2008, Davis began the season in the No. 0 car, but moved over to the No. 01 after one race with RaceGirl sponsoring. This came after his team in the opening race of 2008 was penalized due to an illegal oil tank. The team was penalized 25 driver & owner points, and crew chief Gene Allnut was suspended for 6 races. In the interim, Davis had the 1st ever female crew chief in NASCAR's top touring series at Las Vegas. Kertus at Talladega in 2008 avoided the \"Big One\" again like in 2005 and he finished 12th on the lead lap falling out of the top 10 in turn 4. Following the race at Nashville where he blew his engine, Davis left his father's team to pursue other racing options. He was 24th in points at the time. He spent the rest of the season driving the No. 49 for Jay Robinson. In 2009, Davis returned to Jay Robinson Racing in the No. 49 car. GetMoreVacations.com sponsored the car for a few races in the beginning of the season. After 14 races in 2009 with JRR, Davis went back to his father's team to drive the No. 04 Chevy. He did not race in 2010, but served as crew chief for the No. 0 JD Motorsports Chevrolet driven by Chrissy Wallace in the Aaron's 312 at Talladega;. in 2011 he became the team's competition director.\n\n"}
{"id": "2182690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182690", "title": "Chorda tympani", "text": "Chorda tympani\n\nThe chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve that originates from the taste buds in the front of the tongue, runs through the middle ear, and carries taste messages to the brain. It joins the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) inside the facial canal, at the level where the facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen.\n\nThe chorda tympani is part of one of three cranial nerves that are involved in taste. The taste system involves a complicated feedback loop, with each nerve acting to inhibit the signals of other nerves.\n\nThe chorda tympani exits the cranial cavity through the internal acoustic meatus along with the facial nerve, then it travels through the middle ear, where it runs from posterior to anterior across the tympanic membrane. It passes between the malleus and the incus, on the medial surface of the neck of the malleus.\n\nThe nerve continues through the petrotympanic fissure, after which it emerges from the skull into the infratemporal fossa. It soon joins the pathway of the larger lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve.\n\nThe fibers of the chorda tympani travel with the lingual nerve to the submandibular ganglion.\n\nHere, the preganglionic fibers of the chorda tympani synapse with postganglionic fibers which go on to innervate the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands.\n\nSpecial sensory (taste) fibers also extend from the chorda tympani to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue via the lingual nerve.\n\nThe chorda tympani carries two types of nerve fibers from their origin with the facial nerve to the lingual nerve that carries them to their destinations:\n\nThere are similarities between the tastes the chorda tympani picks up in sweeteners between mice and primates, but not rats. Relating research results to humans is therefore not always consistent.\nSodium chloride is detected and recognized most by the chorda tympani nerve. The recognition and responses to sodium chloride in the chorda tympani is mediated by amiloride-sensitive sodium channels. \nThe chorda tympani has a relatively low response to quinine and varied responses to hydrochloride. The chorda tympani is less responsive to sucrose than is the greater superficial petrosal nerve.\n\nThe chorda tympani nerve carries its information to the nucleus of the solitary tract, and shares this area with the greater superficial petrosal and glossopharyngeal nerves. When the greater superficial petrosal and glossopharyngeal nerves are cut, regardless of age, the chorda tympani nerve takes over the space in the terminal field. This takeover of space by the chorda tympani is believed to be the nerve reverting to its original state before competition and pruning. \nThe chorda tympani, as part of the peripheral nervous system, is not as plastic in early ages. In a study done by Hosley et al. and a study done by Sollars, it has been shown that when the nerve is cut at a young age, the related taste buds are not likely to grow back to full strength. \nIn a bilateral transection of the chorda tympani in mice, the preference for sodium chloride increases compared to before the transection. Also avoidance of higher concentrations of sodium chloride is eliminated. The amiloride-sensitive channels responsible for salt recognition and response is functional in adult rats but not neonatal rats. This explains part of the change in preference of sodium chloride after a chorda tympani transection.\nThe chorda tympani innervates the fungiform papillae on the tongue. According to a study done by Sollars et al. in 2002, when the chorda tympani has been transected early in postnatal development some of the fungiform papillae undergo a structural change to become more “filliform-like”. When some of the other papillae grow back, they do so without a pore.\n\nInjury to the chorda tympani nerve leads to loss or distortion of taste from anterior 2/3 of tongue. However, taste from the posterior 1/3 of tongue (supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve) remains intact.\n\nThe chorda tympani appears to exert a particularly strong inhibitory influence on other taste nerves, as well as on pain fibers in the tongue. When the chorda tympani is damaged, its inhibitory function is disrupted, leading to less inhibited activity in the other nerves.\n\n"}

It is the dominant genre of dance theatre in Cambodia that features the classical dance style ( - \"Robam Kbach Boran\").\n\nIt is performed during public occasions and ceremonies in Cambodia as well as among Cambodians in other countries. Performances entail elaborately dressed dancers performing a slow and figurative set of gestures and poses meant to entrance the viewer. The repertoire includes dances of tribute or invocation and the enactment of traditional stories and epic poems such as the \"Ramayana\".\n\nWestern names for this dance tradition, such as Cambodian court dance, often make reference to the royal court, as the tradition was performed and maintained by attendants of the royal palaces. As a performing art, it is formally referred to as the Royal Ballet of Cambodia (\"le Ballet royal du Cambodge\" in French) by UNESCO, Cravath, Brandon, and others in the academic field, although this term may also refer to the National Dance Company of Cambodia. The term Khmer classical dance is also used alongside \"Royal Ballet of Cambodia\" in publications by UNESCO and the above-mentioned authors.\n\nIn Khmer, it is formally known as \"Robam Preah Reach Trop\" (, lit. \"dances of royal wealth\") or \"Lakhon Preah Reach Trop\" (, lit. \"theatre of royal wealth\"). It is also referred to as \"Lakhon Luong\" (, lit. \"the king's theatre\"). During the Lon Nol regime of Cambodia, the dance tradition was referred to as \"Lakhon Kbach Boran Khmer\" (, lit. \"Khmer theatre of the ancient style\"), a term alienating it from its royal legacy.\n\nKhmer classical dancers, as a whole, are frequently referred to as \"apsara dancers\" by laymen; this usage would be incorrect with the modern form of the dance, as the \"apsara\" is just one type of character among others in the repertoire. Regardless, the tradition's romanticized affiliation with the \"apsaras\" and \"devatas\" of the ruins of Angkor still persists.\n\nAngkor and pre-Angkor era\n\nOne of the earliest records of dance in Cambodia is from the 7th century, where performances were used as a funeral rite for kings. In the 20th century, the use of dancers is also attested in funerary processions, such as that for King Sisowath Monivong. During the Angkor period, dance was ritually performed at temples. The temple dancers came to be considered as apsaras, who served as entertainers and messengers to divinities. Ancient stone inscriptions describe thousands of apsara dancers assigned to temples and performing divine rites as well as for the public. The tradition of temple dancers declined during the 15th century, as the Siamese kingdom of Ayutthaya raided Angkor. When Angkor fell, its artisans, Brahmins, and dancers were taken captive to Ayutthaya.\n\nFrench colonial era\n\nDancers of the court of King Sisowath were exhibited at the 1906 Colonial Exposition in Marseilles at the suggestion of George Bois, a French representative in the Cambodian court. Auguste Rodin was captivated by the Cambodian dancers and painted a series of water colors of the dancers. George Groslier, the French-colonial director of the Phnom Penh Musée Sarraut (today the National Museum), had 're-invented' large parts of the ballet through his studies of the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat.\n\nPost-independent Cambodia\n\nQueen Sisowath Kossamak became a patron of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia. Under the Queen's guidance, several reforms were made to the royal ballet, including choreography. Dance dramas were dramatically shortened from all-night spectacles to about one hour in length. Prince Norodom Sihanouk featured the dances of the royal ballet in his films. \nThe dance tradition suffered setbacks during the Khmer Rouge regime, during which many dancers were put to death in the genocide. Although 90 percent of all Cambodian classical artists perished between 1975 and 1979 after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, those who did survive wandered out from hiding, found one another, and formed \"colonies\" in order to revive their sacred traditions. Khmer classical dance training was resurrected in the refugee camps in eastern Thailand with the few surviving Khmer dancers. Many dances and dance dramas were also recreated at the Royal University of Fine Arts in Cambodia.\n\nIn 2003 it was inducted into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.\n\nDuring the era of the French Protectorate of Cambodia and before, it was customary for guests of the royal palace to receive a performance of the royal ballet. In propitiation ceremonies (, \"\"), it was performed at Wat Phnom and the Silver Pagoda and Throne Hall of the Royal Palace. For entertainment, performances were often staged inside the pavilions of royal palaces. In Phnom Penh, the Moonlight Pavilion was built for and is still used occasionally for classical dance performances. Nowadays, venues for performances by the Royal Ballet include the Chenla Theatre and the Chaktomuk Conference Hall, designed by architect Vann Molyvann during the Sangkum Reastr Niyum era. Tourist restaurants in Cambodia, notably in Siem Reap, also serve as venues for classical dance performances by amateur troupes.\n\nThe traditional stage for classical dance drama performances contains a table with a decorative pillow, sometimes laid on an Oriental rug or carpet. This table of low stature, called a \"krae\" (, lit. \"bed\"), is constant throughout the performance and thus is used as a prop that represents many places and things (a bed, a throne, living quarters, etc.).\n\nIn many dance dramas, characters often wield weapons such as bows, swords, staves, and clubs. In some dances, dancers hold items such as flower garlands, fans, and gold and silver flowers as a tribute (\"see \"). Performances of \" (the makara dance) entail devas dancing in leisure and using fans to represent the scales of the mythical makara while the goddess Manimekhala leads the mimicry with her crystal ball of magic.\n\nKhmer classical dancers use stylized movements and gestures to convey meaning and tell a story. These gestures are often vague and abstract, though some may be easily understood. Dancers do not sing or generally speak, except in some dance dramas where there are brief instances of speech by the dancers.\n\nHand gestures in Khmer classical dance are called \" (meaning \"style\"). These hand gestures form a sort of alphabet and represent various things from nature such as fruit, flowers and leaves. They are used in different combinations and transitions with accompanying movement of the legs and feet to convey different thoughts and concepts. The way gestures are presented, the position of the arm, and the position of the hand relative to the arm can affect their meaning. Gestures are performed in different manners depending on the character type.\n\nFour main types of roles exist in Khmer classical dance: ' (male), ' (female), ' (ogres or asuras), and the ' (monkeys). These four basic roles contain sub-classes to indicate character rank; a ', for example, would be a leading male role and a ' (or ') would be a maiden-servant. The sub-classes of the four main roles all perform in the same type of dancing style of the class they belong to. However, the ', or female ogre, is performed with a feminized dancing style of the male counterpart. Other female character types, such as the apsara, kinnari, or mermaid, follow the same dancing style as the ' role but with subtle differences in gestures; the main difference being costume. The ' character type, although male, is presented with a different dancing style than the \"\".\n\nMost roles are performed by female dancers, but the role of monkeys was transferred to men under the guidance of Queen Sisowath Kosssamak. Other roles performed by men include hermits and animals such as horses and mythical lions.\n\nClassical dance costumes are highly ornate and heavily embroidered, sometimes including sequins and even semi-precious gems. Most of the costumes are thought to be representative of what divinities wear, as reflected in the art style of the post-Angkor period. Various pieces of the costume (such as shirts) have to be sewn onto the dancers for a tight fit.\n\nThe typical female, or ', costume consists of a ' (or '), a type of woven fabric with two contrasting silk threads along with a metallic thread (gold or silver in color). The ' is wrapped around the lower body in a sarong-like fashion, then pleated into a band in the front and secured with a gold or brass belt. In the current style, part of the pleated brocade band hangs over the belt on the left side of the belt buckle, which is a clear distinction from Thai classical dance costumes where this pleated band is tucked into the belt to the right of the belt buckle. Worn over the left shoulder is a shawl-like garment called a ' (also known as the ', literally \"back cover\"); it is the most decorative part of the female costume, embroidered extensively with tiny beads and sequins. The usual embroidery pattern for the \"sbai\" these days is a diamond-shaped floral pattern, but in the past there were more variations of floral patterns. Under the \"sbai\" is a silk undershirt or bodice worn with a short sleeve exposed on the left arm. Around the neck is an embroidered collar called a \"\".\n\nJewelry for the female role includes a large, filigree square pendant of which is hung by the corner, various types of ankle and wrists bracelets and bangles, an armlet on the right arm, and body chains of various styles.\n\nMale characters wear costumes that are more intricate than the females, as they require pieces, like sleeves, to be sewn together while being put on. They are dressed in a ' like their female counterpart; however, it is worn differently. For the male, or \"neay rong\", the ' is worn in the ' fashion, where the front is pleated and pulled under, between the legs, then tucked in the back and the remaining length of the pleat is stitched to the ' itself to form a draping 'fan' in the back. Knee-length pants are worn underneath, displaying a wide, embroidered hem around the knees. For the top, they wear long-sleeved shirts with rich embroidering, along with a collar, or ', around their neck. On the end of their shoulders are a sort of epaulette that arches upwards like Indra's bow (known as '). Other components of the male costumes are three richly embroidered banners worn around the front waist. The center piece is known as a ' while the two side pieces are known as a '; monkeys and yaksha characters wear another piece in the back called a \".\n\nMale characters also wear an X-like strap around the body called a '; it may be made of gold-colored silk or chains of gold with square ornaments, the latter being reserved for more important characters. Males wear the same ankle and wrist jewelry as females, but with the addition of an extra set of bangles on the wrist and no armlets. They also wear a kite-shaped ornament called a ' (named after the bo tree leaf), which serves as a center point for their \".\n\nThere are several types of crowns that denote characters' ranks. Commonly worn by female characters of the lowest rank is the '; it is also worn by Brahmin characters with ornaments around a bun of hair. Divinities and royal characters of the highest ranks wear a tall single-spire crown called a ' for male characters and a ' for female characters. The ' (Groslier romanizes this as '), reserved for princes and generals ('), is a circlet-like crown with a faux knot in the back. The ' is worn by princesses and often by maidens of significance in a dance if they happen to not be of royal rank. Some characters' headdressings include ear ornaments as well as earrings. Characters such as ogres and monkeys wear masks. Ogres and monkeys of royal rank wear masks with a ' attached.\n\nDancers are traditionally adorned with fragrant flowers, although sometimes fresh flowers are substituted with faux flowers. The floral tassel is traditionally made of \"Jasminum sambac\" strung together with \"Michelia\" flowers, being either \"Michelia × alba\" or \"Michelia champaca\". The ' (female) role wears a rose above the right ear and a floral tassel attached to the left side of the crown while the ' (male) role wears a rose on the left ear and a floral tassel to the right side. Sometimes, dancers will wear jasmine garlands fit for the wrists. The \"apsara\" role is most often adorned with the flowers of either \"Plumeria obtusa\" or white cultivars of \"Plumeria rubra\"; sometimes plumerias are tied along the back of their hair.\n\nThe music used for Khmer classical dance is played by a pinpeat ensemble. This type of orchestra consists of several types of xylophones, drums, oboes, gongs, and other musical instruments. The chorus consists of several singers who mainly sing in the absence of music. The lyrics are in poetry form and are sung interspersed with the grammatical particles eu [əː], eung [əːŋ], and euy [əːj] in various patterns.\n\nKhmer classical dance uses particular pieces of music for certain events, such as when a dancer enters or leaves a scene, or performs certain actions, such as flying or walking. These musical pieces are arranged to form a suite. New pieces of music are rarely created.\n\nBelow is a select list of music pieces used in the repertoire:\n\n\nAccording to \"The Cambridge Guide to Asian Theatre\" (1997), the Royal Ballet's repertoire contained approximately 40 dances and 60 dance dramas. Since the restoration of the Royal Ballet in the 1979, some of the old repertoire was recreated and several new dances were also created, most notably \"robam monosanhchettana\" by the late Chea Samy. As of recent years, new dance dramas have been created by the Royal Ballet, such as \"Apsara Mera\". Sophiline Cheam Shapiro has also introduced new repertory to Khmer classical dance, although they are not part of the traditional royal repertoire and mainly have been performed in Western venues. Her works include dramas such as ', an adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Othello\" and ', an adaptation of Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\".\n\nThe repertoire of dance dramas (, ') consists of a myriad of stories, unlike the ', which is limited only to the \"Ramayana\". Many of the dance dramas have analogs in the \"lakhon nai\" dance genre of Thailand but do not share the same choreography or exact storyline. During the time of Queen Kossamak, several dance dramas were re-choreographed and shortened such as \"Roeung Preah Thong-Neang Neak\"; this drama, among others, would be recreated in 2003.\n\nThe plots of many dance dramas often concern a male character who rescues a damsel in distress or destined love presented with obstacles. The traditional repertoire portrays mythology or traditional tales and may sometimes include religious concepts such as karma.\n\nIn contrast to the dance dramas are shorter dances known as '. They can serve several purposes, such as honoring, ritualistic functions (e.g. securing the kingdom's fortune and prosperity), and blessing. Spanning several minutes or so, not all these dances have storylines, although many \"robam\" are indeed excerpts from dance dramas such as ' and ' (the latter being from the ').\n\nThe 'apsara dance' of today was created under the guidance of Queen Kossamak Nearireath. Its costume is based on the bas-relief of \"apsaras\" on temple ruins but much of it, including its music and gesture, is not unique from other classical Khmer dances that probably do not date back to the Angkor period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Notes in this section are referenced from the bibliography above.\"\n\"Notes in this section reference material produced by laymen or reference material not generally considered a legitimate source on the subject matter at hand.

{"id": "2182698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182698", "title": "Where the Streets Have No Name", "text": "Where the Streets Have No Name\n\n\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" is a song by Irish rock band U2. It is the opening track from their 1987 album \"The Joshua Tree\" and was released as the album's third single in August 1987. The song's hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect, played during the song's introduction and again at the end. Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person's religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast. During the band's difficulties recording the song, producer Brian Eno considered erasing the song's tapes to have them start from scratch.\n\n\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was praised by critics and became a commercial success, peaking at number thirteen in the US, number fourteen in Canada, number ten in the Netherlands, and number four in the United Kingdom. The song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour. The song was performed on a Los Angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video, which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video.\n\nThe music for \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed \"The Joshua Tree\" sessions. In an upstairs room at Melbeach House—his newly purchased home—he used a four-track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards, bass, guitar, and a drum machine. Realising that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs, he wanted to \"conjure up the ultimate U2 live-song\", so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan. After finishing the rough mix, he felt he had come up with \"the most amazing guitar part and song of [his] life\". With no one in the house to share the demo with, he recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration.\n\nAlthough the band liked the demo, it was difficult for them to record the song. Bassist Adam Clayton said, \"At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works\". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, \"that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard, as we call them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous.\" Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance.\n\nSo much time had been spent on \"screwdriver work\" that Eno thought it would be best to start from scratch. His idea was to \"stage an accident\" and have the song's tapes erased. He said that this was not to force abandonment of the song, but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance. At one point, Eno had the tapes cued up and ready to be recorded over, but this erasure never took place; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno.\n\nThe studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes. It was one of several songs mixed by Steve Lillywhite in the final months of recording \"The Joshua Tree\". Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. later said of the song, \"It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's not half the song it is live.\"\n\n\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" is played in the key of D major at a tempo of 126 beats per minute. The introduction and outro are played in a time signature, while the remainder of the song is in a common signature. The song opens with an instrumental section, starting with chorale-like sustained synthesiser notes. The guitar fades in after 40 seconds; this part consists of a repeated \"chiming\" six-note arpeggio. A \"dotted eighth\" delay effect is used to \"play\" each note in the arpeggio twice, thus creating a rich sound. The bass and drums enter at 1:10.\n\nThe introduction, following a I–IV–I–IV–vi–V–I chord progression, creates a \"wall of sound\", as described by Mark Butler, against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes. The guitar part played for the remainder of the song features The Edge strumming percussive sixteenth notes. The bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes, respectively, while Bono's vocal performance, in contrast, varies greatly in its timbre, (\"he sighs; he moans; he grunts; he exhales audibly; he allows his voice to crack\") as well as timing by his usage of rubato to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat.\n\nThis development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line \"burning down love\" (A–G–F–D); the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song, the A4 at \"burning\". In later choruses, Bono sings \"blown by the wind\" with the same melody, stretching the same note even longer. After the third chorus, the song's outro is played, the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction, with a six-note guitar arpeggio played against sustained synthesiser notes.\n\nThe lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about Belfast, Northern Ireland, where a person's religion and income were evident by the street on which they lived. He contrasted this with the anonymity he felt when visiting Ethiopia, saying: \"the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren't such divisions, a place where the streets have no name. To me, that's the way a great rock 'n' roll concert should be: a place where everyone comes together... Maybe that's the dream of all art: to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all.\" Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife, Ali; he first wrote them down on an airsickness bag while staying in a village.\n\nAccording to him, the song is ostensibly about \"Transcendence, elevation, whatever you want to call it.\" Bono, who compared many of his lyrics prior to \"The Joshua Tree\" to \"sketches\", said that \"'Where the Streets Have No Name' is more like the U2 of old than any of the other songs on the LP, because it's a sketch—I was just trying to sketch a location, maybe a spiritual location, maybe a romantic location. I was trying to sketch a feeling.\"\n\nThe open-ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send \"a message of hope\" and wish for a \"world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion\". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, \"I'm not sure, really, about that. I used to think it was Belfast...\" Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: \"I can look at it now and recognize that [the song] has one of the most banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with.\"\n\nIn a 2017 interview, Bono said he still felt that the song's lyrics were incomplete, stating \"lyrically it's just a sketch and I was going to go back and write it out\". He expressed regret for rhyming \"hide\" with \"inside\". However, the Edge disagreed with his comments, stating that he loves the song and that Bono is \"very hard on himself\". Eno responded by commending the \"incomplete\" lyrics because he feels \"they allow the listener to finish them\".\n\nOriginally, the third single from \"The Joshua Tree\" was meant to be the song \"Red Hill Mining Town\", but \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was released instead, in August 1987. The single was released on 7-inch, 12-inch, cassette and CD single formats. Three B-sides were featured on the single, including \"Race Against Time\", \"Silver and Gold\", and \"Sweetest Thing\", except for the 7-inch release, which only featured the latter two tracks. The 12-inch single featured \"Race Against Time\" on side A of the record (despite being a \"B-side\"), and the cassette single featured all four tracks on both sides of the tape. Although not as successful as the album's first two singles, the song did chart well. In the U.S., the song peaked at number 13 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 11 on the Album Rock Tracks charts. The song reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, and it topped the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nThe video begins with an aerial shot of a block in Los Angeles, and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc jockeys stating that U2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of 30,000 people. Police show up to the set and inform the band's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing, due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance. Two minutes into the video, U2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th St. and S. Main St., and perform \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building. Towards the end of the song, the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down, and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are booing the police.\n\nThe video for \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was directed by Meiert Avis and produced by Michael Hamlyn and Ben Dossett. The band attracted over 1,000 people during the video's filming, which took place on the rooftop of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on 27 March 1987. The band's performance on a rooftop in a public place was a reference to the Beatles' final concert, as depicted in the film \"Let It Be\".\n\nDuring the shoot U2 played an eight-song set, which included four performances of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". Prior to filming, a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be intruded by a group of fans. A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator, which happened during filming.\n\nThe depiction of the police attempting to shut down the filming due to safety concerns actually happened during filming, just as seen in the video. Hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police. According to Avis, the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day \"almost in real time\", and that \"getting busted was an integral part of the plan.\" Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video, but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video. In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel, which was rebuilt to create some interest, in case no one showed up at the film shoot. Although the video is of a live performance, the audio used is from the studio-recorded version of the song. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards.\n\n\"Race Against Time\" was released on the 12-inch, cassette, and CD versions of the single. The song developed from the band's interest in urban funk, and was described by The Edge as \"a kind of Afro-rhythmic piece\" and \"a study in rhythm.\" The bass riff in the song, inspired by the bodhrán, was played by The Edge, but stemmed from some of Clayton's unused bass parts. Mullen's drum part was recorded in a single take. The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase \"Race against time\". Bono said of the song, \"It reminds me of the desert. The desert is so empty, but it aches with a strange kind of fullness.\" John Hutchinson of \"Musician\" magazine described the song as having an \"African flavour\" and as being reminiscent of Peter Gabriel. The track was used in the \"Miami Vice\" episode \"Child's Play\",\nand is the only one of the single's B-sides that was never played live.\n\n\"Silver and Gold\" was written in support of the Artists United Against Apartheid project, which protested the South African apartheid. In 1985, Bono participated in Steven Van Zandt's anti-apartheid \"Sun City\" project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones. When Richards and Jagger played blues, Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. Bono realised that U2 \"had no tradition\", and he felt as if they \"were from outer space\". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song \"Silver and Gold\", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood. It was re-recorded by U2 for the \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" single while the band returned to Dublin in May 1987 during a break between the first and second legs of The Joshua Tree Tour. The song was described by \"Musician\" as \"tough and raw, with Bono in husky and confident voice, underpinned by a sinuous bass line, and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues-based guitar.\" \"Silver and Gold\" was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times, one performance of which was featured on the band's 1988 album and rockumentary, \"Rattle and Hum\". Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of \"The Joshua Tree\". The studio version was also included on the limited edition B-sides bonus disk of the band's first compilation album, \"The Best of 1980–1990\".\n\n\"Sweetest Thing\" was written by Bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday. The song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play. Some of Bono's lyrics have been described as reminiscent of John Lennon. The Edge described it as \"a beautiful song... which is pop as it should be—not produced out of existence, but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity\", also noting that \"It's very new for us.\" It was re-recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in 1998 as a single in its own right for \"The Best of 1980–1990\". \"Hot Press\" editor Niall Stokes stated that this track, along with \"Race Against Time\", is \"an indicator of what U2 might have made instead of \"The Joshua Tree\".\"\n\nUpon the release of \"The Joshua Tree\", critics praised \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". Steve Morse of \"The Boston Globe\" noted the \"bell-like tones from the Edge fram[e] a search for heaven\" and along with the subsequent track on the album, \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", these songs showed how the group were \"pilgrims still on a quest; not preachers who claim to have found answers\". \"The Bergen Record\" echoed these sentiments, saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest. \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"assertive rock\" in their review of \"The Joshua Tree\". The \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" said of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", \"the music charges, like someone fleeing for life\". \"The Washington Post\" said the track is \"a bit oblique lyrically, but the implications are clear in Bono's resolute delivery, Dave (the Edge) Evan's quavering guitar, Adam Clayton's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen's rolling thunder drums\".\n\n\"NME\" lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album \"starts by spitting furiously\". The publication praised Bono's impassioned singing and The Edge's guitar playing, which transformed the instrument into \"something more than an endlessly abused piece of wood\". The review commented that the \"last ten seconds are breathtakingly beautiful\". \"The Rocket\" wrote that the song builds a \"wall of sound\" that Bono's vocals cut through with a \"wail of desperation, as the lyrics agonize the need for personal spirituality\". The reviewer compared the opening riff to Simple Minds' \"Ghostdancing\". Reviewing \"The Joshua Tree\", Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an \"epic opener\". The service's Steve Huey, in a review of the song, praised its \"insistent, propulsive rhythmic drive and anthemic chorus\", qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite. He called the song the \"perfect album-opener\", crediting the \"slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak\". Huey also called Bono's delivery \"passionate and grandiose\" and \"his commitment to the material unshakable\". He believed the combination of his vocals and the band's \"sonic power\" is what gave U2 its \"tremendous force\".\n\n\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" made its concert debut on 2 April 1987 at Arizona State University Activity Center in Tempe, Arizona on the opening night of The Joshua Tree Tour. A version featuring an extended introduction was performed on the closing nights of the third leg of The Joshua Tree tour, again in Tempe, Arizona, on December 19 & 20, 1987, and footage from the performance was featured in the \"Rattle and Hum\" film. The song has since been played at nearly every full-length concert that U2 has headlined, totaling upwards of 900 performances . The song is widely regarded as one of the group's most popular live songs. Bono said of it, \"We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives, but when we go into that song, everything changes. The audience is on its feet, singing along with every word. It's like God suddenly walks through the room.\"\n\nOn The Joshua Tree Tour, \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was most often used to open concerts. Fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting. The \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" wrote that, \"From the lofty sonic opening strains of [the song], this audience was up, ecstatic and inflamed.\" \"NME\" wrote that the song is one such occasion where \"the power afforded their songs is scary\", noting that during the song's opening, \"the arena ERUPTS\". In other reviews, the song was called: \"uplifting\", \"exhilarating\", and \"powerful\". Out of the 109 shows during The Joshua Tree Tour, \"Streets\" was played at all except 12 of the concerts. During the Lovetown Tour which took place in 1989 and the beginning of 1990, \"Streets\" was only left out of the set list at one of the 47 concerts.\nThe song was performed at every show on the 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour. Concerts from this tour were elaborate multimedia spectacles that Bono performed as a variety of characters, but for the end of the main set, the group reverted to playing classics, including \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", straight. Some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from \"The Joshua Tree\" photo shoot. The video was speeded up for humorous effect—\"NME\" described the effect as giving it a \"silly, Charlie Chaplin quality\"—and Bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens. This video would make a return during performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the U2 360° Tour. Some of the Zoo TV performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the Pet Shop Boys' synthpop cover of the song (titled \"Where the Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take My Eyes off You)\"). Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys' interpretation. Critics welcomed the song in the group's set list: \"The Independent\" said the song \"induces instant euphoria, as U2 do what they're best at, slipping into epic rock mode, playing music made for the arena\". In two other local newspaper reviews, critics praised the song's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits.\n\nFor the PopMart Tour of 1997–1998, U2 returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the Zoo TV Tour. The set's massive video screen displayed a video that \"Hot Press\" described as an \"astonishing, \"\"-style trip into the heart of a swirling, psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal monolith\". Near the end of the song, peace doves were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set's golden arch were projected upwards. \"Hot Press\" said the effect transformed the stadium into a \"UFO landing site\".\n\nShortly before the third leg of the Elevation Tour, the September 11 attacks occurred in New York City and Washington D.C. During the band's first show in New York City following the attacks, the band performed \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", and when the stage lights illuminated the audience, the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans. The experience was one inspiration for the song \"City of Blinding Lights\". The band paid tribute to the 9/11 victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show on 3 February 2002. The performance featured the names of the September 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band, and concluded with Bono opening up his jacket to reveal the Star Spangled Banner. U2's appearance was later ranked number 1 on \"Sports Illustrated\"s list of \"Top 10 Super Bowl Halftime Shows\".\n\nFor the Vertigo Tour, the group originally considered dropping the song from their set lists, but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this. All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured a performance of the song, which were accompanied by the stage's LED video curtains displaying African flags. On the tour's opening night, this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village. He thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle, saying, \"And here it was, nearly twenty years later, coming back to Africa, all the stuff about parched lands and deserts making sense for the first time.\" The song was also played at the preview screening of the band's concert film \"U2 3D\" at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.

He competed in the NASCAR Busch North Series between 2000 and 2004, and in the Busch Series between 2003 and 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Wolfe was slated to drive the No. 6 Dodge Charger for Evernham Motorsports. In the first four events, Wolfe failed to finish in the top twenty-five once and did not qualify for a race at Mexico City's Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez. He was immediately replaced by Jeremy Mayfield and Kasey Kahne, with team owner Ray Evernham stating that the team \"felt it was necessary at this time to make some changes to ensure [it is] competitive.\" He remained under contract with the team and returned to race the car in three more events later in the year, finishing in the top-ten at Nashville Superspeedway in his final race with the team. Afterwards, he signed with FitzBradshaw Racing; he raced both the No. 40 and No. 12 Dodges in a combined five races, with his best finish being 23rd. He then worked with FitzBradshaw as crew chief on the #12 and No. 22 Dodge Chargers driven in the NASCAR Grand National Division and Busch East Series by 2006 ROTY Ruben Pardo and John Freeman.\n\nIn 2008, Wolfe worked with Braun Racing as crew chief of the No. 38 Toyota driven by Jason Leffler in the NASCAR Nationwide Series.\n\nIn 2009, Wolfe worked as crew chief for CJM Racing while Mike Bliss was driving CJM's No. 11 car.\n\nIn 2010, Wolfe joined Penske Racing as crew chief of Brad Keselowski's No. 22 Dodge. Paul Wolfe and Brad Keselowski won the Nationwide series championship in 2010, giving Roger Penske his first NASCAR title of any kind.\n\nIn 2011, Wolfe remained with Penske, reuniting with Keselowski in the Sprint Cup Series, replacing Jay Guy. Paul and Brad got their first victory together in the STP 400 at Kansas Speedway, edging Dale Earnhardt Jr. by stretching their fuel mileage. Later in the season, the duo also won at Pocono, and Bristol, propelling the No. 2 team into the Chase.\n\nIn 2012, Wolfe lead Penske Racing to its first ever NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship, and making Wolfe the first NASCAR Crew Chief to win championships in both the Nationwide and Sprint Cup Series.\n\nOn March 2, 2014, Wolfe's wife Aleah gave birth to their first child, Caden Paul. As a result, Wolfe did not serve as Keselowski's crew chief at The Profit on CNBC 500 that day.\n\nWolfe moved to Penske's No. 22 team with Joey Logano in 2020.\n\n"}

In addition, pregnenolone is biologically active in its own right, acting as a neurosteroid.\n\nIn addition to its role as a natural hormone, pregnenolone has been used as a medication and supplement; for information on pregnenolone as a medication or supplement, see the pregnenolone (medication) article.\n\nPregnenolone and its 3β-sulfate, pregnenolone sulfate, like DHEA, DHEA sulfate, and progesterone, belong to the group of neurosteroids that are found in high concentrations in certain areas of the brain, and are synthesized there. Neurosteroids affect synaptic functioning, are neuroprotective, and enhance myelinization. Pregnenolone and its sulfate ester may improve cognitive and memory function. In addition, they may have protective effects against schizophrenia.\n\nPregnenolone is an allosteric endocannabinoid, as it is a negative allosteric modulator of the CB receptor. Pregnenolone is involved in a natural negative feedback loop against CB receptor activation in animals. It prevents CB receptor agonists like tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active constituent in cannabis, from fully activating the CB. \n\nPregnenolone has been found to bind with high, nanomolar affinity to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the brain. In contrast to pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate did not bind to microtubules. However, progesterone did and with similar affinity to pregnenolone, although unlike pregnenolone, it did not increase binding of MAP2 to tubulin. Pregnenolone was found to induce tubule polymerization in neuronal cultures and to increase neurite growth in PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor. As such, pregnenolone may control formation and stabilization of microtubules in neurons and may affect both neural development during prenatal development and neural plasticity during aging.\n\nAlthough pregnenolone itself does not possess these activities, its metabolite pregnenolone sulfate is a negative allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor as well as a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor. In addition, pregnenolone sulfate has been shown to activate the transient receptor potential M3 (TRPM3) ion channel in hepatocytes and pancreatic islets causing calcium entry and subsequent insulin release.\n\nPregnenolone has been found to act as an agonist of the pregnane X receptor.\n\nPregnenolone has no progestogenic, corticosteroid, estrogenic, androgenic, or antiandrogenic activity.\n\nPregnenolone is synthesized from cholesterol. This conversion involves hydroxylation of the side chain at the C20 and C22 positions, with cleavage of the side chain. The enzyme performing this task is cytochrome P450scc, located in the mitochondria, and controlled by anterior pituitary trophic hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone, in the adrenal glands and gonads. There are two intermediates in the transformation of cholesterol into pregnenolone, 22\"R\"-hydroxycholesterol and 20α,22\"R\"-dihydroxycholesterol, and all three steps in the transformation are catalyzed by P450scc. Pregnenolone is produced mainly in the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the brain. Although pregnenolone is also produced in the gonads and brain, most circulating pregnenolone is derived from the adrenal cortex.\n\nTo assay conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, radiolabeled cholesterol has been used. Pregnenolone product can be separated from cholesterol substrate using Sephadex LH-20 minicolumns.\n\nPregnenolone is lipophilic and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. This is in contrast to pregnenolone sulfate, which does not cross the blood–brain barrier.\n\nPregnenolone undergoes further steroid metabolism in one of several ways:\n\n\nNormal circulating levels of pregnenolone are as follows:\n\n\nMean levels of pregnenolone have been found not to significantly differ in postmenopausal women and elderly men (40 and 39 ng/dL, respectively).\n\nStudies have found that pregnenolone levels are not significantly changed after surgical or medical castration in men, which is in accordance with the fact that pregnenolone is mainly derived from the adrenal glands. Conversely, medical castration has been found to partially suppress pregnenolone levels in premenopausal women. Similarly, an adrenalectomized premenopausal woman showed incompletely diminished circulating pregnenolone levels.\n\nPregnenolone is also known chemically as pregn-5-en-3β-ol-20-one. Like other steroids, it consists of four interconnected cyclic hydrocarbons. The compound contains ketone and hydroxyl functional groups, two methyl branches, and a double bond at C5, in the B cyclic hydrocarbon ring. Like many steroid hormones, it is hydrophobic. The sulfated derivative, pregnenolone sulfate, is water-soluble.\n\n3β-Dihydroprogesterone (pregn-4-en-3β-ol-20-one) is an isomer of pregnenolone in which the C5 double bond has been replaced with a C4 double bond.\n\nPregnenolone was first synthesized by Adolf Butenandt and colleagues in 1934.\n"}

The ions are trapped in a Penning trap (a magnetic field with electric trapping plates), where they are excited (at their resonant cyclotron frequencies) to a larger cyclotron radius by an oscillating electric field orthogonal to the magnetic field. After the excitation field is removed, the ions are rotating at their cyclotron frequency in phase (as a \"packet\" of ions). These ions induce a charge (detected as an image current) on a pair of electrodes as the packets of ions pass close to them. The resulting signal is called a free induction decay (FID), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of sine waves. The useful signal is extracted from this data by performing a Fourier transform to give a mass spectrum.\n\nFT-ICR was invented by Melvin B. Comisarow and Alan G. Marshall at the University of British Columbia. The first paper appeared in Chemical Physics Letters in 1974. The inspiration was earlier developments in conventional ICR and Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy. Marshall has continued to develop the technique at The Ohio State University and Florida State University.\n\nThe physics of FTICR is similar to that of a cyclotron at least in the first approximation.\n\nIn the simplest idealized form, the relationship between the cyclotron frequency and the mass-to-charge ratio is given by\n\nwhere \"f\" = cyclotron frequency, \"q\" = ion charge, \"B\" = magnetic field strength and \"m\" = ion mass.\n\nThis is more often represented in angular frequency:\n\nwhere formula_3 is the angular cyclotron frequency, which is related to frequency by the definition formula_4.\n\nBecause of the quadrupolar electrical field used to trap the ions in the axial direction, this relationship is only approximate. The axial electrical trapping results in axial oscillations within the trap with the (angular) frequency\n\nwhere formula_6 is a constant similar to the spring constant of a harmonic oscillator and is dependent on applied voltage, trap dimensions and trap geometry.\n\nThe electric field and the resulting axial harmonic motion reduces the cyclotron frequency and introduces a second radial motion called magnetron motion that occurs at the magnetron frequency. The cyclotron motion is still the frequency being used, but the relationship above is not exact due to this phenomenon. The natural angular frequencies of motion are\n\nwhere formula_8 is the axial trapping frequency due the axial electrical trapping and formula_9 is the reduced cyclotron (angular) frequency and formula_10 is the magnetron (angular) frequency. Again, formula_9 is what is typically measured in FTICR. The meaning of this equation can be understood qualitatively by considering the case where formula_8 is small, which is generally true. In that case the value of the radical is just slightly less than formula_13, and the value of formula_9 is just slightly less than formula_3 (the cyclotron frequency has been slightly reduced). For formula_10 the value of the radical is the same (slightly less than formula_13), but it is being subtracted from formula_13, resulting in a small number equal to formula_19 (i.e. the amount that the cyclotron frequency was reduced by).\n\nFTICR-MS differs significantly from other mass spectrometry techniques in that the ions are not detected by hitting a detector such as an electron multiplier but only by passing near detection plates. Additionally the masses are not resolved in space or time as with other techniques but only by the ion cyclotron resonance (rotational) frequency that each ion produces as it rotates in a magnetic field. Thus, the different ions are not detected in different places as with sector instruments or at different times as with time-of-flight instruments, but all ions are detected simultaneously during the detection interval. This provides an increase in the observed signal-to-noise ratio owing to the principles of Fellgett's advantage. In FTICR-MS, resolution can be improved either by increasing the strength of the magnet (in teslas) or by increasing the detection duration.\n\nA review of different cell geometries with their specific electric configurations is available in the literature. However, ICR cells can belong to one of the following two categories: closed cells or open cells.\n\nSeveral closed ICR cells with different geometries were fabricated and their performance has been characterized. Grids were used as end caps to apply an axial electric field for trapping ions axially (parallel to the magnetic field lines). Ions can be either generated inside the cell or can be injected to the cell from an external ionization source. Nested ICR cells with double pair of grids were also fabricated to trap both positive and negative ions simultaneously.\n\nThe most common open cell geometry is a cylinder, which is axially segmented to produce electrodes in the shape of a ring. The central ring electrode is commonly used for applying radial excitation electric field and detection. DC electric voltage is applied on the terminal ring electrodes to trap ions along the magnetic field lines. Open cylindrical cells with ring electrodes of different diameters have also been designed. They proved not only capable in trapping and detecting both ion polarities simultaneously, but also they succeeded to separate positive from negative ions radially. This presented a large discrimination in kinetic ion acceleration between positive and negative ions trapped simultaneously inside the new cell. Several ion axial acceleration schemes were recently written for ion–ion collision studies.\n\nStored-waveform inverse Fourier transform (SWIFT) is a method for the creation of excitation waveforms for FTMS. The time-domain excitation waveform is formed from the inverse Fourier transform of the appropriate frequency-domain excitation spectrum, which is chosen to excite the resonance frequencies of selected ions. The SWIFT procedure can be used to select ions for tandem mass spectrometry experiments.\n\nFourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry is a high-resolution technique that can be used to determine masses with high accuracy. Many applications of FTICR-MS use this mass accuracy to help determine the composition of molecules based on accurate mass. This is possible due to the mass defect of the elements. FTICR-MS is able to achieve higher levels of mass accuracy than other forms of mass spectrometer, in part, because a superconducting magnet is much more stable than radio-frequency (RF) voltage. Another place that FTICR-MS is useful is in dealing with complex mixtures, such as biomass or waste liquefaction products, since the resolution (narrow peak width) allows the signals of two ions with similar mass-to-charge ratios (\"m\"/\"z\") to be detected as distinct ions. This high resolution is also useful in studying large macromolecules such as proteins with multiple charges, which can be produced by electrospray ionization. For example, attomole level of detection of two peptides has been reported. These large molecules contain a distribution of isotopes that produce a series of isotopic peaks. Because the isotopic peaks are close to each other on the \"m\"/\"z\" axis, due to the multiple charges, the high resolving power of the FTICR is extremely useful. FTICR-MS is very useful in other studies of proteomics as well. It achieves exceptional resolution in both top-down and bottom-up proteomics. Electron-capture dissociation (ECD), collisional-induced dissociation (CID), and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) are all utilized to produce fragment spectra in tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Although CID and IRMPD use vibrational excitation to further dissociate peptides by breaking the backbone amide linkages, which are typically low in energy and weak, CID and IRMPD may also cause dissociation of post-translational modifications. ECD, on the other hand, allows specific modifications to be preserved. This is quite useful in analyzing phosphorylation states, O- or N-linked glycosylation, and sulfating.\n\n"}

{"id": "2182727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182727", "title": "Treaty of York", "text": "Treaty of York\n\nThe Treaty of York was an agreement between the kings Henry III of England and Alexander II of Scotland, signed at York on 25 September 1237, which affirmed that Northumberland (which at the time also encompassed County Durham), Cumberland, and Westmorland were subject to English sovereignty. This established the Anglo-Scottish border in a form that remains almost unchanged to modern times (the only modifications have been regarding the Debatable Lands and Berwick-upon-Tweed). The treaty detailed the future status of several feudal properties and addressed other issues between the two kings, and historically marked the end of the Kingdom of Scotland's attempts to extend its frontier southward.\n\nThe treaty was one of a number of agreements made in the ongoing relationship between the two kings. The papal legate Otho (also known as Oddone di Monferrato) was already in the Kingdom of England at Henry's request, to attend a synod in London in November 1237. Otho was informed in advance by Henry of the September meeting at York, which he attended. This meeting was recorded by the contemporary chronicler Matthew Paris, who disparaged both Alexander and Otho. Paris' untruthful allegations towards Alexander, portraying him as boorishly uncivil and aggressive, have been repeated uncritically in several historical accounts.\n\nHenry and Alexander had a history of making agreements to settle one matter or another, and related to this was their personal relationship. Alexander was married to Henry's sister Joan and Alexander's sister Margaret had married Hubert de Burgh, a former regent to Henry. On 13 August 1237 Henry advised Otho that he would meet Alexander at York to treat of peace. An agreement was reached on 25 September \"respecting all claims, or competent to, the latter, up to Friday next before Michaelmas A.D. 1237\".\n\nThe title of the agreement is Scriptum cirographatum inter Henricum Regem Anglie et Alexandrum Regem Scocie de comitatu Northumbrie Cumbrie et Westmerland factum coram Ottone Legato and the particulars of the agreement are:\n\nHistorians have shown little interest in the agreement, either mentioning it in passing or ignoring it altogether. Stubbs does not mention it in his \"Constitutional History of England\", nor does Hume in his \"History of England\". Skene's \"Celtic Scotland\" refers to it as an agreement in his background discussion for the reign of Alexander II's successor, Alexander III, while Burton's \"History of Scotland\" mentions that claims of land were discussed in 1237 and briefly describes some of them, but makes no reference to an agreement or treaty. James Hill Ramsay's \"Dawn of the Constitution\" gives a fuller discussion of the agreement, but does not give it any particular prominence.\n\nThe treaty gained additional prominence due to the chronicler Matthew Paris (c. 1200–1259), who is known for his rhetorical passion and his invectives against those with whom he disagreed. Paris describes the Papal legate Otho in negative terms, as someone who was weak and timid in the face of strength but overbearing in his use of power over others, and as someone who avariciously accumulated a large amount of money. He describes Alexander and Henry as having a mutual hatred in 1236, with Alexander threatening to invade England. He describes the 1237 meeting at York as the result of Henry's and Otho's invitation to Alexander, and that when Otho expressed an interest in visiting Scotland, Alexander claimed no legate had ever visited Scotland and he would not allow it, and that if Otho does enter Scotland he should take care that harm does not befall him. Paris goes on to say that in 1239 as Otho was leaving for Scotland, that when Alexander had previously met with Otho in 1237 he had become so excited in his hostility at the possibility of Otho's visit to Scotland that a written agreement had to be drawn up concerning Otho's visit.\n\nThere is nothing to recommend Paris' account as having any validity, as it is contradicted by known facts regarding dates and correspondences, and by knowledge of previous visits to Scotland by legates. Legates had visited Scotland in the reigns of Alexander's father William I, his uncle Malcolm IV, and his grandfather David I, and Alexander himself had seen a Papal legate hold a council at Perth for four days, making his alleged outrage and threats incongruous and highly improbable.\n\n"}

He was chairman of the board of the Postal Telegraph and Cable Corporation and president of the Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company.\n\nHe was born on April 17, 1874 in San Francisco, California to Louise Antoinette (née Hungerford) Bryant Mackay (1843–1928) and John William Mackay (pronounced MACK-ee). His father was a silver miner and telegraph mogul who had been born in Dublin and emigrated to America with his parents. After arriving in America, his father died soon after, and John sold newspapers and got a shipyard job to support his mother and sister. Eventually, he went west, and with three partners, formed a mining corporation and discovered the \"Big Bonanza\" in Virginia City, Nevada, which became the largest single deposit of gold and silver ever found. More than $100 million dollars worth of gold (over $2.5 billion in today's currency) was extracted from that mine before it was exhausted in 1898, making all of them unimaginably wealthy. His father then married his mother and adopted her daughter by an earlier marriage. They lived between Paris and New York, where they brought up this daughter and their two sons, John and Clarence.\n\nClarence sold his major source of income, the Postal Telegraph Company, to the new International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT) for an enormous amount of stock. The 1929 stock market crash wiped him out; he survived the Great Depression by selling his art and antiques. He was eventually reconciled with Ellin and her husband when he went to comfort her on the cot death of her baby; Irving Berlin always treated his father-in-law with respect and affection. Both Ellin Berlin and Clarence's granddaughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, were successful writers.\n\nAround 1897, Mackay met Katherine Alexander Duer (1880–1930), who was a beautiful debutante from an old, high society, New York family that he met on a steamship crossing between New York and England. She was a direct descendant of Lady Kitty Duer, daughter of Lord Stirling. They fell in love and were married on May 17, 1898. Harbor Hill in Roslyn, Long Island, the site of their future estate with the striking view of Hempstead Harbor, was Katherine's and Clarie's wedding present from the senior Mackays. Katherine oversaw much of the design and building of their mansion at Harbor Hill which was designed by Stanford White of McKim, Mead, and White and was the largest home White ever designed. Katherine was a suffragette and a champion of women's rights and became the first woman member of the Roslyn school board in 1905. Together, Clarence and Katherine were the parents of three children: \n\n\nIn 1910, Katherine left Clarence and her three children to run away with Dr. Joseph Blake, the doctor who had cured Clarence's throat cancer. Blake then cured her eye cancer, and he in turn ran away with her nurse. The marriage officially ended in divorce in Paris in 1914. Katherine returned to New York in 1930, the same year she died from cancer.\n\nBecause of religious convictions, he was a traditional Irish-American Catholic, Mackay would not remarry as long as his first wife, Katherine, lived. Therefore, Clarence and Anna Case (1888–1984) waited until after Katherine's death in 1930, and were subsequently married in 1931 at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Roslyn, New York. His wedding gift to Anna was a platinum-set emerald and diamond necklace. The emerald was mined in Colombia and the necklace designed by Cartier. Anna was a lyric soprano who sang with the Metropolitan Opera and as a concert soloist. \"Her life changed dramatically following an engagement to sing at a private musicale given in the home of Clarence H. Mackay (c. 1916). Taken with her beauty, he sent a carload of flowers to her at her next Carnegie Hall recital, enclosing a small diamond band with an enamel bluebird in the center.\"\n\nHe died of cancer on November 12, 1938. His funeral was at St. Patrick's Cathedral where the New York Philharmonic played. He was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery.\n\nAnna Case Mackay donated her diamond necklace to the Smithsonian Institution in 1984.\n\nClarence Mackay was a noted collector of medieval suits of armor, some of which he sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the early 1930s. An aviation trophy, administered by the United States National Aeronautic Association and awarded yearly by the United States Air Force for the \"most meritorious flight of the year\" by an Air Force person, persons, or organization, is named in Mackay's honor.\n\n"}

She was unknown until a cache of 26 votive offerings to her were discovered in 2002 in an undisclosed field at Ashwell End in Hertfordshire by metal detectorist Alan Meek. Her imagery shows evidence of syncretism between a pre-Roman goddess with the Roman Minerva (for a parallel, cf. Sulis Minerva, the Romano-British goddess worshipped at Bath).\n\nSenuna's shrine consisted of a ritual midden, onto which offerings were thrown, surrounded by a complex of buildings including workshops and accommodation for pilgrims. It was certainly no humble crossroads shrine. The dedicatory artefacts kept in the shrine were subsequently buried together on the edge of the midden, perhaps intended for temporary safe-keeping, in the late 3rd or 4th century CE.\n\nThe offerings to Senuna include silver plaques with gold highlights, seven gold plaques and a superb set of jewellery, including a brooch and cloak clasps. The plaques still have the metal tabs which allowed them to be set upright, and are so thin that they would then have shivered and glittered in any draught. Some votive plaques were punched out in tiny holes, some incised. The jewellery incorporated older gems and glass beads, including a superb carved cameo of a lion trampling an ox skull which was already old and worn before it was set into the brooch. All of the jewellery shared intricate decoration in minutely coiled wire, and the set may have been specially made as an offering. An exhibit of offerings to Senuna may be seen in Room 49 of the British Museum, labelled \"Near Baldock Hoard\".\n\nAs well as the jewellery, there were deposits of Celtic coins, mostly several centuries old at the time of deposition, and of Bronze Age metalwork, perhaps collected from local round barrows. There were also food offerings of piglets and small quantities of cremated human bone.\n\nThe Senuna hoard includes at least five inscriptions. One example reads,\n\nAnother inscription found on a votive offering of jewellery was left by a man named Servandus of Spain:\n\nThe silver figurine portrays Senuna as a graceful woman with hair coiled in a bun. The breast and face of the goddess rotted away in the soil centuries ago. Her arms have been reconstructed with pieces (No. A2 & A3) from the Ashwell-hoard. She appears to have been holding some ears of corn in her right hand and a \"phiale\" or \"placenta\" (a sacrificial cake) in her left hand. She is believed to have been originally positioned on a pedestal (No. A1a) bearing the inscription: \"\".\n\nAt least twelve of the votive plaques show classical images of Minerva, with spear, shield and owl; the five of these that carried an inscription were dedicated to Senuna rather than Minerva.\n\nSenuna's name appears in various forms on the votive plaques, namely Senuna, Sena, and Senua. Conceivably it might be related to the Proto-Celtic *\"seno-\" 'old'. In the Ravenna Cosmography \"senua\" forms part of one name located most likely in the Solent.\n\nThe discovery of offerings to Senuna has inspired various practitioners of modern Neopaganism in the United States and Britain.\n\n"}
{"id": "2182762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182762", "title": "William Clubb", "text": "William Clubb\n\nWilliam Reid (Billy) Clubb (October 7, 1884—August 11, 1962) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1941, and was a prominent cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken.\n\nClubb was born in Morris, Manitoba, the son of George Clubb and Alice Jix, and was educated at Manitoba public schools, the Winnipeg Business College and Manitoba Agricultural College. He worked as a farmer, and served on the Morris municipal council from 1916 to 1920. In 1913, he married Gertrude Barbara Kastner.\n\nHe was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1920. Clubb ran as an independent farmer candidate in the constituency of Morris, and defeated rival candidate Alex Ayotte by 165 votes. For the next two years, he sat with a small farmer's caucus led by William Robson.\n\nIn 1921, Clubb served with John Bracken on a special committee to review the prices of oil and gas for Manitoba's agricultural community. He was impressed with Bracken's knowledge of the province, and with his presence of mind in the discussions.\n\nHe later joined the United Farmers of Manitoba, and defeated Ayotte by a greater margin in the 1922 election. The United Farmers and their allies won an unexpected majority government in the 1922 election, and took office as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. As the UFM did not have a leader, the party caucus met on July 20, 1922 to choose a premier. Clubb recommended Bracken for the position, and his name was allowed to stand. At the end of the meeting, the only others candidates still under consideration were federal Members of Parliament Thomas Crerar and Bob Hoey.\n\nOn July 21, 1922, Clubb telephoned Bracken to inform him that he was one of three candidates under consideration for the job. Bracken, who had not previously considered a career in politics, allowed his name to stand after a brief discussion.\n\nThe next day, Crerar and Hoey both rejected the UFM offer. Bracken was non-committal, and but made a strong impression on the party caucus. He was persuaded to accept the position, and appointed Clubb as his Minister of Public Works. He was formally sworn into cabinet on August 8, 1922. The custom of the age required him to resign and contest a by-election; he was returned without opposition. Clubb was the only member of Bracken's cabinet with prior legislative experience, and was one of Bracken's most trusted confidantes in the government's early years.\n\nRe-elected by a landslide in the 1927 election, Clubb helped oversee a controversial leasing arrangement with the Winnipeg Electric Company (WEC) in the late 1920s. This arrangement provoked a scandal in 1929, when Clubb acknowledged before a royal commission that he had purchased WEC shares the previous year, when negotiations were still in progress. Bracken initially defended Clubb, but was pressured into accepting his resignation from cabinet on February 22, 1929.\n\nIn Clubb's defence, it may be noted that other legislators from various parties had also purchased shares while the negotiations were in progress. In fact, his share purchase was arranged by John Thomas Haig, a prominent Conservative legislator and personal friend. Clubb maintained that he did nothing improper in the transaction. Bracken never regarded Clubb's suspension from cabinet as permanent, and on May 18, 1929, he was returned to cabinet in his previous portfolio.\n\nIn late 1929, Clubb and other prominent ministers supported a policy of cooperation with the provincial Liberal Party. This policy of cooperation led to a formal alliance in 1932, and Clubb was re-elected in that year's provincial election as a supporter of the \"Liberal-Progressive\" government. The parties were effectively merged after the election, and government members became known as Liberal-Progressives.\n\nJust before the election, Clubb had been given additional cabinet responsibility as Manitoba's first Minister of Labour. He continued to hold both the Public Works and Labour portfolios throughout the 1930s.\n\nClubb faced a difficult re-election in the 1936 campaign, and resigned from cabinet in 1940 with the creation of an all-party coalition government. He did not seek re-election in 1941.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1956, he was commissioner of the Manitoba liquor board. Clubb was also an avid curler and flyer.\n\nHe died in Morris at the age of 77.\n"}

{"id": "2182776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182776", "title": "Thrift store chic", "text": "Thrift store chic\n\nThrift store chic refers to a style of dressing where clothes are cheap and/or used. Clothes are often bought from thrift stores such as the Salvation Army, Goodwill, or Value Village. Originally popular among the hippies of the late 1960s, this fashion movement resurfaced during the mid-1980s among teenagers, and expanded into the 1990s with the growing popularity of such music and style influences including the grunge band Nirvana. Thrift store chic can be considered as an anti-fashion statement because it does not follow fashion trends and does not attempt to look expensive or new.\n\nThrift store chic is often composed of vintage T-shirts (striped tees and anything with vintage graphics, in particular), sweaters, flannel ‘lumberjack’ shirts, and worn and torn jeans. This laid back, nonchalant, and aloof look became fashionable and trendy without attempting to. Originally worn for a variety of reasons, which include an homage, or attempt to resurrect earlier styles, or even in protest to the exploitation of third world child workers in sweat shops. By the late 2000s many of the younger indie kids wore thrift store clothes primarily for its ironic anti-fashion connotations, attempting to look like a homeless person who can afford expensive electronics.\n\nThrift store chic is also popular among people who enjoy creating their own outfits from pieces of used clothing. This DIY (do-it-yourself) approach creates original articles of clothing that can be very personalized. For example, in the 1986 movie \"Pretty in Pink\", Molly Ringwald’s character, Andie Walsh, is fond of taking clothing from thrift stores and creating a unique and eclectic wardrobe. One very memorable article is the prom dress she creates, made from merging two separate dresses.\n\nDuring the 1990s, singers such as Kurt Cobain, Courtney Love, and Eddie Vedder promoted the look. Kurt Cobain’s style included uncoordinated and non-brand-name items of clothing that created the look of a carelessly cool grunge rock star. Clothes often had holes or tears in them and were worn in many layers, which hid the body. Cobain’s modest style contrasted from the aggressive and glamorous style of bands such as Guns N’ Roses. Fans of Nirvana found it easy to emulate his style, thus identifying themselves and the grunge movement. His thrift store style also reflected an ironic stance against corporate culture. Ironic, because his band had signed with the corporate music label Geffen Records.\n\nEntering the 2000s, this look because associated with musical scenes including indie rock and emo gradually spreading to the hipster movement. The hipster movement is popular among people in their 20s and 30s whose style attempts to reject mainstream trends. The hipster movement embraced thrift store chic because of its love for vintage items, especially clothing. Items that became popular for indie girls included flowery cotton dresses, cardigans, keffiyehs, and eyeglasses chosen deliberately for their unfashionable connotations. Hipster-thrift-store-chic embraces nostalgia and irony by combining old trucker-caps and vintage bowling t-shirts with worn luxury goods like leather jackets, old military dress uniforms as a protest against the war in Iraq, or used business wear, such as tweed cloth sportcoats.\n\nWith the stock market crash of 2008, shopping at thrift stores became more widely accepted. Bragging about how much an item of clothing cost was no longer about how expensive it was, but rather how cheap it cost.\nShowing off a six-hundred-dollar pair of shoes when people were losing their jobs was no longer tactful. In the United States, resale stores experienced an average of 35% increase in sales. Purchasing used clothing has lost much of its stigma also due to the growing environmental movement towards consumption.\nBecause textiles can be difficult to recycle (especially mixed blends), reusing clothing is considered environmentally friendly because it makes use of material that would have otherwise potentially ended up in a landfill.\n\nIn 2013, the Macklemore and Lewis's single \"Thrift Shop\" reached number 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song glorifies shopping at thrift shops and denounces expensive brands, such as Gucci, as \"getting tricked by a business.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2182779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182779", "title": "First Rays of the New Rising Sun", "text": "First Rays of the New Rising Sun\n\nFirst Rays of the New Rising Sun is a compilation album by American rock musician Jimi Hendrix, featuring songs mostly intended for his planned fourth studio album. The 17-track album was one of the first releases overseen by Experience Hendrix, a family company that took over management of his recording legacy. MCA Records released the album in 1997 and it reached the album charts in the United States, United Kingdom, and four other countries.\n\nHendrix recorded most of the songs with former Jimi Hendrix Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Billy Cox, who had performed for \"Band of Gypsys\" (1970). Also, most were recorded in 1970 at Hendrix's new Electric Lady Studios in New York City. \n\nAll of the songs had been released previously on Hendrix's first posthumous albums \"The Cry of Love\" (1971), \"Rainbow Bridge\" (1971), and \"War Heroes\" (1972). \"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\" superseded \"Voodoo Soup\", the 1995 attempt by controversial interim Hendrix producer Alan Douglas to realize Hendrix's fourth album.\n\nAt the time of his death in 1970, Hendrix was working on enough songs for a double album, with one proposed title \"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\". The tracks were in varying stages of development, with only about six believed to be near completion. Long-time Hendrix recording engineer Eddie Kramer and drummer Mitch Mitchell selected 17 of what they felt were the best tracks, which were first released on \"The Cry of Love\", \"Rainbow Bridge\", and \"War Heroes\". From the 1970s through the 1990s, the songs also appeared on other posthumous compilations supervised by producer Alan Douglas, who wiped bass and drums performances by Mitchell, Cox and Miles and overdubbed them with newly recorded by session musicians. He also added female backing singers to one track, and claimed co-composer credit on several tracks. For the 1997 compilation, Kramer instead used the original master recordings and sequenced the songs to realize Hendrix's plans to the best of his abilities. He selected tracks based on their original level of completion and Hendrix's personal notes.\n\nAccording to Richie Unterberger in his \"Rough Guide to Jimi Hendrix\" (2009), \"Some Hendrix fans might take issue with \"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\" being classified as a compilation, rather than as a studio album, consisting as it does solely of studio recordings, most of them cut and/or polished shortly before his death in September 1970... Yet when all is said and done, [it] is not what Hendrix would have issued as his fourth album. No such record could be posthumously compiled, as nobody knows with absolute certainty what songs he would have included, and what additional production work he might have done on the ones he had laid down in the studio, no matter how complete they might have seemed to others.\"\n\nSeveral additional songs that appeared on Hendrix's proposed track listings for his fourth studio album were later released by Experience Hendrix: \"Valleys of Neptune\", \"Cherokee Mist\", \"Bleeding Heart\",\"Hear My Train A Comin'\" (also known as \"Getting My Heart Back Together Again\"), \"Lover Man\", \"Midnight Lightning\" (demo), and \"Send My Love to Linda\". Another three, \"Come Down Hard on Me Baby\", \"The Drifter's Escape\", and \"Burning Desire\", were issued on \"Loose Ends\" (1974).\n\nWhen \"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\" was released in 1997, it charted at number 49 on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States, and at number 37 on the UK Albums Charts in Britain. In 2010, the album was remastered and re-released by Sony Legacy, on March 8 in the UK and March 9 in the US.\n\nAccording to Robert Christgau in \"Blender\", \"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\" was Kramer's reimagination of Hendrix's projected double LP, which was not as remarkable musically as his last studio album \"Electric Ladyland\" (1968) and \"not too profound lyrically\". Nonetheless, Christgau deemed it a suitable successor to \"The Cry of Love\", as well as \"a powerful collection by a genius whose songwriting kept growing and whose solos rarely disappoint.\" Sean Murphy from \"PopMatters\" believed it was more successful than \"The Cry of Love\" in realizing Hendrix's vision. He highlighted the \"liberating presence\" of bassist Billy Cox, deeming him an improvement over Noel Redding. According to Murphy, Cox allowed the band to \"spread out and chase the guitarist as he soars above, around and beneath them\". \"Rolling Stone\" magazine called the album \"a cohesive cosmic missive\", writing that it \"illuminates what would have been a transitional phase for Hendrix\".\n\nFrom the original MCA Records \"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\" CD booklet:\n\nBand members\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nAdditional personnel\n"}

The Cup is awarded by the Brimstone Cup Committee to the team with the most points in games played between the two. If the two teams have the same points against each other at the end of the year (including MLS regular season and playoff games and the U.S. Open Cup), then the cup stays with the team holding it at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe cup was created during the 2001 season by the supporters' groups of both clubs, Section 8 from Chicago and the Inferno from Dallas. Its name came from a reference of the names of the two teams at the time, as FC Dallas was then known as the Dallas Burn. The name is reflected with a quote from Virgil's Aeneid engraved on the base: \"The more the kindled combat rises high'r, The more with fury burns the blazing fire.\" The two supporters groups contracted with the R.S. Owens Corporation, the makers of the Academy Awards since 1982, to craft the physical Brimstone Cup.\n\nThe Brimstone Cup remained in Chicago for the fourth season in a row following a 2–0 Chicago home victory at Toyota Park, now known as SeatGeek Stadium, on August 2, 2015. On July 16, 2016, FC Dallas regained the Cup for the first time in four years with a 3-1 home victory at Toyota Stadium.\n\nUnofficial results\n"}

They replaced the balloon idents, and spelled the end of the much recognised globe identity by the BBC, which had been used in various ways since 1963.\n\nThe presentational package featured numerous people of various backgrounds dancing in a predominantly red background to a soundtrack based around an upbeat central jingle. The BBC One logo is now located in a red box, similar in style to BBC Two's idents of the time, with the BBC logo stacked on top of an upper case 'ONE'. The music for all idents was written by Peter Lawlor of Water Music Productions in London. The look was also the first one not to feature a station clock. It has been reported that a station clock was designed for the new look, however BBC Marketing decided not to use it. The concerns with this stemmed around a lack of serious ident to link into the news, and indeed this problem famously occurred one day into the new look upon the death of The Queen Mother.\n\nPromotional style originally consisted of the BBC One box placed in the lower left corner of the screen throughout the promotion and an end board consisting of a translucent white strip along the bottom containing the box logo. This end board style was recreated for the, less frequently seen, static captions. This style was changed on 1 May 2004 to an orange background that would close shut over the end of a promotion to contain the programme title. The static slide was also updated, with the space for the programme image reduced to the top quarter of the screen.\n\nThe BBC continued its long tradition of using special idents at Christmas time throughout this branding period. The first ident, \"Snowflakes\" featured children dressed as snowflakes falling to earth and running around against a red sky background. This ident was used in 2002 and, for the first time in its history, was re-used again in 2003. BBC Two also followed suit the same year, although rather than re-using an ident, they were used alongside that year's newer one. This re-using of the previous years ident caused public controversy and, as a result a new ident, entitled \"Christmas Puddings\", was created the following year. The ident featured children dressed in red and bouncing on Space Hoppers that looked like Christmas puddings against a red background. The ident was designed by a young viewer of the children's programme \"Blue Peter\", as part of a competition. A new ident was commissioned for 2005 entitled \"Christmas Tree\". In this one included children, again dressed in red, walking round a giant Christmas tree, carrying brightly coloured balls. The background this time was green, and the look and music has often been compared to the 2005 film \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" directed by Tim Burton. On BBC One Wales, in 2005, an ident was shown to celebrate Wales' win in the 2005 Six Nations Championship. Played to the \"Festival\" music, it featured Wales supporters celebrating in a public house. The ONE in the BBC ONE box in the bottom-left corner of the screen was replaced with WON.\n\nThis look was unusual in that no special idents were produced for events or programmes. However, a way used to promote the third series of \"Little Britain\" was for the shows announcer, Tom Baker to provide the continuity announcements for the evening over the normal idents.\n\nThe idents were very quickly parodied by digital channel E4 in 2002 with spoofs of the Capoeira, Ballet and Acrobat idents.\n\nComedians French and Saunders also created spoof idents for their 2002 Christmas special in which, dressed as old women, they first copied the Acrobat ident yet came loose from their ribbons and fell to the ground while in a spoof of Hip-Hop, the pair drove around slowly in mobility scooters at the setting of the Salsa ident.\n\nComedian Peter Kay also made spoof editions of the Hip-Hop ident in 2003 in the guise of his \"Phoenix Nights\" character Brian Potter. The second version was shown minus the BBC One logo in 2005. This ident was used to introduce the Comic Relief of 2003.\n\nA further spoof featured Jon Culshaw as Tony Blair dancing in a fictional ident outside 10 Downing Street. This was shown on a July 2003 episode of \"Dead Ringers\", broadcast on BBC Two.\n\nSpoofs have also cropped up in BBC Three's animated adult comedy series \"Monkey Dust\", making use of the generic red theme of the normal idents to show short films such as a gangland killing and the resulting aftermath.\n\nIn August 2005, BBC One controller Peter Fincham had hinted that the dancers may be on their way out. He told the Edinburgh International Television Festival that \"It may well be that the time is coming to look at a new way of doing it. No date or direct decision has been made but it's under review\".\n\nIn September 2005, it was announced that the BBC were working on a new set of idents to replace the dancers. A spokeswoman said \"There is an idea for a change, but it is in very early days\".\n\nAccording to the \"Media Guardian\", Fincham then confirmed that in autumn 2006, the 'Rhythm and Movement' idents would be replaced with a new presentation package, along with a new schedule. As speculated, Red Bee Media would create the new presentation package. Red Bee created the new idents for the ITV channels that were introduced in January 2006. On 26 September the BBC confirmed that from 7 October 2006, the 'Rhythm and Movement' idents would be replaced by a new Circle ident collection, including kites, surfers and hippopotamuses.\n\nThe idents aired for the final time on 7 October 2006, at 1:10am, in which a montage of idents was aired together, ending with the rarely seen 'Ballet' ident. The new idents made their debut on 7 October 2006 at 9:58am BST, marking the end of the 'Rhythm and Movement' idents, which had defined the channel for four and a half years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2182788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182788", "title": "Shopgirl", "text": "Shopgirl\n\nShopgirl is a 2005 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Anand Tucker and starring Steve Martin, Claire Danes, and Jason Schwartzman. The screenplay by Steve Martin is based on his 2000 novella of the same title. The film is about a complex love triangle between a bored salesgirl, a wealthy businessman, and an aimless young man.\nProduced by Ashok Amritraj, Jon Jashni, and Steve Martin for Touchstone Pictures and Hyde Park Entertainment, and distributed in the United States by Buena Vista Pictures, \"Shopgirl\" was released on October 21, 2005 and received positive reviews from film critics. The film went on to earn $11,112,077 and was nominated for four Satellite Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nin 2003, Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes) is an aspiring artist from Vermont who works at the evening gloves counter at Saks Fifth Avenue, Beverly Hills. Her quiet, orderly existence filled with both the mundane – futon furniture and an aging pickup truck – and the serious – a large student loan and a supply of antidepressants – is disrupted by the sudden appearance of two disparate men.\n\nJeremy (Jason Schwartzman) is an immature, socially inept, penniless graphic designer for an amplifier manufacturer and an aspiring typographer who meets Mirabelle in a laundromat. Mirabelle, aching for meaningful contact, gives Jeremy a chance but it quickly fizzles after a halfhearted date, followed by a woefully underwhelming sexual encounter.\n\nRay Porter (Steve Martin) is an older, suave, wealthy, divorced logician who charms Mirabelle over several dates, one of which ends at his house. Mirabelle offers herself to him, and the morning after they have sex, Ray tells her that he does not intend for their relationship to be serious due to his constant travel between L.A. and Seattle. Each has a different understanding of this talk: Ray tells his psychiatrist that Mirabelle knows he will see other people, and Mirabelle tells her acquaintances that Ray wants to see her more.\n\nMirabelle and Ray embark on a lengthy affair, while Jeremy attempts to have one last liaison with Mirabelle before leaving as a roadie for the band Hot Tears, but she spurns him due to her relationship with Ray. While on tour, the band's lead singer introduces Jeremy to the world of self-improvement and how to better relate to the opposite sex. Mirabelle becomes increasingly devoted to Ray, who showers her with expensive gifts, such as paying off her student loans, instead of emotional affection. When Mirabelle's depression hits hard, as she has ceased taking her antidepressants because Ray makes her happy, he takes her to the doctor and cares for her, further deepening her reliance on him. Ray invites Mirabelle on a trip to New York, and has her fitted in the dress shop at Armani.\n\nDuring a business trip, Ray has dinner with an old girlfriend who propositions him and he accepts, confessing the liaison to Mirabelle. Devastated, Mirabelle ends the relationship, abandons her trip to New York, and visits Vermont instead. While she basks in the warmth and familiarity of home, Ray calls to apologize for hurting her and asks her to meet him in New York. There, he takes her to a large party where she is the youngest guest and feels alone and out of place. At the hotel room, Ray wants to be intimate but Mirabelle rejects him.\n\nReturning to California, Mirabelle encounters Jeremy on the way to an art show, and they arrive together. Her coworker Lisa, suspicious of Mirabelle’s new clothes, mistakes Jeremy for Ray, and Jeremy's self-improvement is obvious to everyone but Mirabelle. After the show, Mirabelle goes home with Ray, and Lisa goes home with Jeremy thinking he is Ray. In the morning, Ray devastates Mirabelle by announcing his plans to find a bigger house in case he meets someone and decides to have kids. Jeremy calls Lisa, but learns she has no interest in anything but Ray Porter and his money.\n\nMirabelle permanently ends her relationship with Ray and, after a brief period of mourning, quits her job at Saks to become a receptionist in an art gallery. Jeremy pursues her again, properly, and they fall in love. Mirabelle is invited to show her work at the gallery, and Ray attends the opening with his new girlfriend, a gynecologist. Jeremy is clearly proud of Mirabelle, and their relationship is in stark contrast to Ray and Mirabelle, whose conversation is full of recognition yet noticeably strained. Ray apologizes for how deeply he hurt her and admits that he did love her and Mirabelle is visibly touched by his admission, and runs lovingly into Jeremy's arms. Watching the healthy, openly loving couple, Ray remarks that he feels a loss even though he had kept Mirabelle \"at arm's length\" to avoid the pain of their inevitable breakup.\n\n\nIn Steve Martin's original novella, Mirabelle was employed by Neiman Marcus. According to \"Evolution of a Novella: The Making of Shopgirl\", a bonus feature on the DVD release, Saks Fifth Avenue actively pursued participation in the film by presenting a proposal to the producers and director and promising full cooperation with filming schedules. The gloves in the counter are not from Saks, but a boutique in Toronto, where some of the film was shot.\n\nAccording to Martin's book \"Born Standing Up\", there are many parallels to Martin's own life. Early in his career, he lost a girlfriend to an older, suave gentleman resembling Ray Porter, real-life Mason Williams. Williams had a house that matches the description of Ray Porter's, it overlooked Los Angeles from roughly the same vantage point and the descriptions of the two houses are the same. Williams was an actuary at one point, whereas Porter was a logician. Martin and Williams both vied for the attention of a girlfriend, Nina. The relationship ended when Martin, much like the Schwartzman character, goes on a cross-country tour as a roadie. These parallels make the novella somewhat autobiographical.\n\nIn addition, character Mirabelle is partially based on artist Allyson Hollingsworth who was a consultant to the movie, and who had a relationship with Martin in the '90s. Photographs and drawings attributed to Mirabelle in the movie are by Hollingsworth.\n\nMartin had Tom Hanks in mind for the role of Ray Porter at the time he was writing the screenplay, but director Anand Tucker felt that Martin was so close to the material and had such a strong understanding of the character that Martin should play the part himself. After auditioning numerous actresses, he knew Claire Danes was perfect for the role of Mirabelle as soon as she began reading lines with Martin. He found Jeremy much more difficult to cast, and remembered Jason Schwartzman (but not his name) from his performance in \"Rushmore\" only two weeks before filming was scheduled to begin.\n\nThe apartment building used for Mirabelle's residence is located at 1630 Griffith Park Boulevard in Los Angeles.\n\nThe songs \"Lily & Parrots\", \"Carry Me Ohio\" and \"Make Like Paper\" were written and performed by Mark Kozelek. Tucker remembered him from his appearance in \"Almost Famous\" and cast him as the lead singer of Hot Tears. Both \"Carry Me Ohio\" and \"Lily and Parrots\" were tracks on \"Ghosts of the Great Highway\", the first CD released by Kozelek's real-life band Sun Kil Moon. \"Make Like Paper\" was a track from \"Songs for a Blue Guitar\", an album by Kozelek's earlier band Red House Painters.\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005. It was shown at the Chicago International Film Festival and the Austin Film Festival before going into limited release in the US.\n\nThe film grossed $10,284,523 in the US and $1,303,682 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $11,588,205.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 6.27 out of 10. The site's consensus states: \"\"Shopgirl\" is precariously slight, but it has some intriguing moments, and Danes is luminous.\" On Metacritic it has a score of 62 out of 100 based on 37 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"B-\" on scale of A to F.\n\nIn his review in \"The New York Times\", A.O. Scott called the film \"elegant and exquisitely tailored . . . both funny and sweetly sad\" and added, \"[It] is a resolutely small movie, finely made and perhaps a bit fragile. Under the pressure of too much thought, it might buckle and splinter; the characters might look flimsy, their comings and goings too neatly engineered, their lovability assumed rather than proven. And it's true that none of them are perfect. From where I sit, though, the film they inhabit comes pretty close.\"\n\nMick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" described it as \"a film of wisdom, emotional subtlety and power . . . directed with a rare combination of delicacy and decisiveness.\"\n\nIn \"Variety\", Joe Leydon observed, \"Martin hits all the right notes while subtly conveying both the appealing sophistication and the purposeful reserve of Ray. But he cannot entirely avoid being overshadowed by Danes' endearingly vulnerable, emotionally multifaceted and fearlessly open performance. (In a few scenes, she appears so achingly luminescent it's almost heartbreaking to watch her.) The two stars bring out the very best in each other, particularly in a poignant final scene.\"\n\nCarina Chocano of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the film is \"like \"Pygmalion\" for the upper-middle-brow business class flier. Which isn't to say it's bad. On the contrary, it's smart, spare, elegant and understated . . . Danes can fill a scene with one wounded glance, and her body language alone conveys a richness of character that makes an otherwise not very expressive character mesmerizing.\"\n\nIn \"Rolling Stone\", Peter Travers rated it three out of four stars and commented, \"The May–December thing worked in \"Lost in Translation\" and it works here, thanks to the perceptive and gracefully romantic script that Martin has adapted from his novella. This is not the wild-and-crazy Martin of \"Bringing Down the House\", this is the Martin who writes for \"The New Yorker\" with erudition and wit.\"\n\nSteve Persall of the \"St. Petersburg Times\" graded the film C and called it \"too slight to be considered a movie yet padded enough to pose as a feature-length work . . . The blessing and curse of cinema is its ability to compress ideas into simple images. When the ideas are this simple, cinema crushes them to dullness. Mirabelle's unremarkable life simply doesn't deserve big screen treatment. Any author other than a Hollywood favorite like Martin likely wouldn't get it done.\"\n\nIn \"New York\", Ken Tucker stated, \"The challenge of the movie consists of making you believe that these two people, separated by age and status, could fall in love. \"Shopgirl\" succeeds in this with a confidence so sure and serene that you feel through much of the movie as though you’re listening to a fairy tale, an effect enhanced by the voice-over narration provided in soothing tones by Martin-as-Ray.\"\n\nSusan Wloszczyna of \"USA Today\" said, \"A serene luminescence surrounds Claire Danes [who] – reduced of late to action drivel (\"Terminator 3\") or bit roles (\"The Hours\") — finally fulfills the potent promise of her mid-'90s TV series \"My So-Called Life\". Los Angeles doesn't look half-bad, either. When director Anand Tucker isn't training his camera on the jewel-like traffic lights below or the sparkling cosmos above, he portrays the City of Angels as a haven of spare elegance and urbane stylishness, as if it were Woody Allen's Manhattan but with better weather and inviting outdoor pools. But save for savoring Danes and an L.A. cleansed of gaudy excess, there is little that is truly novel about \"Shopgirl\" . . . The film ultimately lets Mirabelle down and leaves the viewer dissatisfied. A \"Lost in Translation\" drained of its wryly observed humor, \"Shopgirl\" is worth a browse. But it isn't always easy to buy.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2182789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182789", "title": "Yali High School", "text": "Yali High School\n\nYali High School (), also known as Yali () is a senior high school located in Changsha, Hunan Province in the People's Republic of China, or a group of secondary schools containing Yali School itself and several branches. It is a first-tier key school in Hunan's public school system and is one of the most selective schools in the nation. Admission is competitive, based mainly on the score in city-wide or province-wide examinations as well as talent in science, music, sports, and the arts. The school and other three prestigious high schools in Changsha (including First High School of Changsha, Changjun High School and High School Attached to Hunan Normal University), are recognized \"the Famous Four\".\n\nIn 2007, Yali was included in the \"Top 100 Schools\" list published by the Top One-Hundred Schools website in China. It topped the list of the five schools that made to the top 100 from Hunan Province (This list published the schools by province and does not rank them nationally.)\n\nFounded in 1906 by Yale-in-China (), the Yali School () was an American-owned private school during the first half of the 20th century and has been a public school since then. The name Yali 雅礼 (pinyin: Yǎ Lǐ) comes from the Analects of Confucius, meaning elegance of expression (ya 雅) and propriety of conduct (li 礼), and is a transliteration of Yale in the early 20th century. Yali's school colors are blue, white (Yale colors) and red (China).\nBrownell Gage, Warren Seabury, Lawrence Thurston, and Arthur Williams, all graduates of Yale College in the 1890s, founded Yale-in-China, and brought the mission to Changsha between 1901 and 1905. In 1906, the mission's preparatory school, or the Yali School, began operations. During the same year, Edward H. Hume, M.D., commenced the medical work in Changsha. His experiences are described in his 1946 book \"Doctors East, Doctors West: An American Physician's Life in China\", (W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.). In 1912 Yali's first graduates received degrees.\n\nThe campus was expanded in 1914. By 1928, Yali started opening up its administrative and leadership roles to Chinese educators. While Yali students were known for their academic performance, they were also athletes, with the school's athletic teams - soccer, volleyball, track, for example - winning provincial and national tournaments.\n\nIn 1938, Yali students and faculty moved to Yuanling in western Hunan to avoid bombing in Changsha during the Japanese invasion of China. Teaching continued in Yuanling for seven years before the school returned to Changsha in 1946.\n\nIn November 1948, the US government started evacuating Americans in China. Dr. Dwight Rugh became the last Yale-China representative in China. In 1951, Dr. Rugh was brought to the new gym on the Yali campus in a school-wide meeting to condemn \"American Capitalist Invaders\"; he returned to America via Hong Kong soon after. During the same year, the municipal government of Changsha took over the administration of the Yali School and changed its name to Changsha Number Five Middle School to be integrated into the city's public school system. The School's tie with Yale-China was cut off. During the next few decades, Yali experienced political turbulence that swept much of China.\n\nDwight Rugh is the father of Betty Jean Rugh (now BJ Elder), who grew up in Changsha and later moved to the United States with her parents. BJ Elder published a book in 2003 titled \"The Oriole's Song - An American Girlhood in Wartime China\" (see cited sources below), describing her childhood in Changsha on the Yali campus and the various trips she made back to China in the decades following the family's forced departure.\n\nIn 1980, Yali, known at the time still as Changsha Number Five middle School, returned to operations from a whole decade of chaos. With the new \"reform and opening-up\" policy instituted by Deng Xiaoping, more freedom to connect with the outside world was realized. Yali alumni from the first half of the 20th Century started working between Changsha and New Haven, seeking to re-establish the Yale-China connection. In 1985, the school revived its relationship with the Yale-China Association and was once again known as Yali. The next year, Yale-China bachelors, now known as English Language Instructors (\"ELI\", also a nickname for Yalies), arrived on campus and resumed teaching responsibilities in the English Department.\n\nSince 1986, Yali has reinvented itself again as an institution of secondary education in China. While following a standard curriculum prescribed by the Ministry of Education, it expanded its education philosophy to include extracurriculars and specialty education. The school has received provincial and national recognitions for its high quality education to young minds.\n\nIn 1992, it was recognized as one of the first Provincial Key Schools in Changsha, establishing it as a premier institution in China's public school system. Yali has reached out to institutions in many other countries and established sister school relationships internationally. In 2001, the school received a delegation from Yale University led by Yale's president, Richard Levin, in celebration of both the Centennial of Yale-China Association as well as the Tercentennial of Yale University. In 2006, Yali celebrated its own Centennial, bringing back alumni and former teachers from all parts of the world.\n\nSince 1999,Yali School have established several branches, some are complete secondary schools and some only contain junior high school. In 2006, the junior department of Yali stopped enrollment owing to certain education policy. The teachers and other staffs were moved to different Yali branches.\n\nYali school, or called the \"Yali Headquarters\", is a day school located near the city-center (on Laodong Road between Furong Ave and Shaoshan Ave). The main teaching building is rebuilt in 2012. There are over 3000 students study there in 2018. The International Department which was founded in 2011 is also at Yali School.\n\nNanya Middle School (, literally \"\"South Yali Middle School\" \"), or \"Yali Boarding Middle School\" formerly, is a boarding school campus located in the southern Changsha (on Xiangzhang Road), with over 7000 students through Grade 7 to 12 in 2012. It was a private school at its establishment in 2002, but changed to public since 2012. It is one of the top schools in Hunan and is considered to be a second choice for students who prefer Yali. Its junior department is one of the major student sources of Yali: one-third of new students of Yali in 2013 are from Nanya.\n\nBeiya Middle School (, literally \"\"North Yali Middle School\" \"), is a public boarding school campus located in the northern Chansha, with about 3000 students within Grade 7 to 9 in 2012, which was established in 2009.\n\n\n\nYali graduates score among the highest in China's college entrance examinations and are accepted by the country's finest universities. Furthermore, numerous graduates from the school are accepted by various foreign institutions, either in North America or other countries. In recent years, many a graduates are admitted by first-tier universities, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Yale University, Cornell University, University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, etc., which is rare among Chinese high schools.\n\nFor all students, Chinese, Math, English, and physical education are required. Aside from these compulsory subjects, other curricular requirements include: \n\nAll science classes have lab sessions.\n\nCourses are also offered in computer science, graphic design, mechanics and robotics, research-oriented seminars, and others.\n\nWith its strength in science education, Yali has a long history of emphasizing and participating in science olympiads, for which purpose the \"01\" class of each grade is established to give students specialized education in the natural sciences. In recent years, Yali students are noted for their achievements in all five natural science subjects, and in particular informatics: Yali students have won 9 gold medals and 1 silver medal in International Olympiad in Informatics and dozens of medals in National Olympiad in Informatics, which ranked first in the whole country, while the medals in other subjects including 1 gold and 1 silver medal in IMO, 1 gold medal in IChO, 1 gold medal in IBO and 2 gold medals in APhO.\n\nThe school has also started a research-oriented seminar program for students to carry out group projects in the social sciences, the arts, and community engagement.\n\nThe school also started a partnership with China's Central Conservatory of Music, in which a Yali Center for the Arts was established between the two institutions located in Nanya. The purpose of the partnership is to bring high-quality music education and discover young talent.\n\nThe school has an annual Yali Cup soccer game; each class unit in the same grade organizes its own teams and compete with other teams. With soccer and basketball being the most popular sports, the men's soccer team and women's basketball team have repeatedly won provincial tournaments and are placed high in national rankings. Physical education is required for students in all grades.\n\nYali students participate in various extracurricular activities, including student newspaper, magazine, student union, radio station, TV station, orchestra, band, drama and traditional dance.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is composed of seven justices, who are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Maine Senate. From 1820 until 1839, justices served lifetime appointments with a mandatory retirement age of 70. Beginning in 1839, justices are appointed for seven-year terms, with no limit on the number of terms that they may serve.\n\nKnown as the Law Court when sitting as an appellate court, the Supreme Court's other functions include hearing appeals of sentences longer than one year of incarceration, overseeing admission to the bar and the conduct of its members, and promulgating rules for all the state's courts.\n\nThe Maine Supreme Judicial Court is one of the few state supreme courts in the United States authorized to issue advisory opinions, which it does upon request by the governor or legislature, as set out in the Maine Constitution.\n\nIt is also unusual for a state's highest appellate court in that its primary location is not that of the state's capital city, Augusta, partially because the Kennebec County Courthouse did not have a courtroom large enough for the Supreme Court's proceedings. The court did meet there from 1830 until 1970, when it permanently moved to the Cumberland County Courthouse. The renovation of the Kennebec County Courthouse in 2015, which included expansion of the bench in its largest courtroom to permit all 7 MSJC justices to sit there, will allow the court to meet there at least twice a year. It will also continue to meet in Portland, Bangor, and at high schools around the state.\n\nThe MSJC is also authorized to rule on the fitness of the Governor of Maine to serve in office, which it does upon the Maine Secretary of State certifying to the court that the governor is temporarily unable to carry out the duties of that office. The court must then hold a hearing and, if it agrees that the governor is unfit, declare the office of governor temporarily vacant and transfer its duties to the President of the Maine Senate, who would serve as acting governor. If the Secretary of State later certifies to the Supreme Court that the governor is fit to resume office, the court would then decide whether it agrees.\n\nAs of , the justices of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court are:\n\nThere are two active retired justices.\n\n"}

Branches of the OA supply all the structures in the orbit as well as some structures in the nose, face and meninges. Occlusion of the OA or its branches can produce sight-threatening conditions.\n\nThe OA emerges from the internal carotid artery usually just after the latter emerges from the cavernous sinus although in some cases, the OA branches just before the internal carotid exits the cavernous sinus. The OA arises from the internal carotid along the medial side of the anterior clinoid process and runs anteriorly passing through the optic canal with and inferolaterally to the optic nerve. The ophthalmic artery can also pass superiorly to the optic nerve in a minority of cases. In the posterior third of the cone of the orbit, the ophthalmic artery turns sharply and medially to run along the medial wall of the orbit.\n\nThe central retinal artery is the first, and one of the smaller branches of the OA and runs in the dura mater inferior to the optic nerve. About 12.5mm (0.5 inch) posterior to the globe, the central retinal artery turns superiorly and penetrates the optic nerve, continuing along the center of the optic nerve, entering the eye to supply the inner retinal layers.\n\nThe next branch of the OA is the lacrimal artery, one of the largest, arises just as the OA enters the orbit and runs along the superior edge of the lateral rectus muscle to supply the lacrimal gland, eyelids and conjunctiva.\n\nThe OA then turns medially, giving off 1 to 5 posterior ciliary arteries (PCA) that subsequently branch into the long and short posterior ciliary arteries (LPCA and SPCA respectively) which perforate the sclera posteriorly in the vicinity of the optic nerve and macula to supply the posterior uveal tract. In the past, anatomists made little distinction between the posterior ciliary arteries and the short and long posterior ciliary arteries often using the terms synonymously. However, recent work by Hayreh has shown that there is both an anatomic and clinically useful distinction. The PCAs arise directly from the OA and are end arteries which is to say no PCA or any of its branches anastomose with any other artery. Consequently, sudden occlusion of any PCA will produce an infarct in the region of the choroid supplied by that particular PCA. Occlusion of a short or long PCA will produce a smaller choroidal infarct, within the larger area supplied by the specific parent PCA.\n\nThe OA continues medially the superior and inferior muscular branches arise either from the OA directly or a single trunk from the OA subsequently divides into superior and inferior branches to supply the extraocular muscles.\n\nThe supraorbital artery branches from the OA as it passes over the optic nerve. The supraorbital artery passes anteriorly along the medial border of the superior rectus and levator palpebrae and through the supraorbital foramen to supply muscles and skin of the forehead.\n\nAfter reaching the medial wall of the orbit, the OA again turns anteriorly. The posterior ethmoidal artery enters the nose via the posterior ethmoidal canal and supplies the posterior ethmoidal sinuses and enters the skull to supply the meninges.\n\nThe OA continues anteriorly, giving off the anterior ethmoidal artery which enters the nose after traversing the anterior ethmoidal canal and supplies the anterior and middle ethmoidal sinuses, as well as the frontal sinus and also enters the cranium to supply the meninges.\n\nThe OA continues anteriorly to the trochlea, where the medial palpebral arteries (superior and inferior) arise and supply the eyelids.\n\nThe OA terminates in two branches, the supratrochlear (or frontal) artery and the dorsal nasal artery. Both exit the orbit medially to supply the forehead and scalp.\n\nBecause of the obvious importance of the ocular globe, branches of the ophthalmic artery often are subdivided into two groups: those that supply the eyeball (ocular group) and those that supply non-ocular orbital structures (orbital group).\n\nThe orbital group, distributing vessels to the orbit and surrounding parts, includes:\n\nThe ocular group, distributing vessels to the eye and its muscles, includes:\n\nBranches of the ophthalmic artery supply:\n\nSevere occlusion of the ophthalmic artery causes ocular ischemic syndrome. As with central retinal artery occlusions, ophthalmic artery occlusions may result from systemic cardiovascular diseases; however, a cherry-red spot is typically absent and the vision is usually worse. Amaurosis fugax is a temporary loss of vision that occurs in two conditions which cause a temporary reduction in ophthalmic artery pressure: orthostatic hypotension and positive acceleration.\n\nEven complete occlusion of the ophthalmic artery may possibly leave the eye without symptoms, probably because of circulatory anastomoses\n\n\n"}

Buffalo Airways was launched by Bob Gauchie and later sold to one of his pilots, Joe McBryan (aka \"Buffalo Joe\"). It operates charter passenger, charter cargo, firefighting, and fuel services, and formerly operated scheduled passenger service. Its main base is at Yellowknife Airport (CYZF). It has two other bases at Hay River/Merlyn Carter Airport (CYHY) and Red Deer Regional Airport (CYQF). The Red Deer base is the main storage and maintenance facility. The airline is also the subject of the History television reality series \"Ice Pilots NWT\".\n\nIn 2007, Buffalo Airways began producing a clothing line that included T-shirts, hoodies, and hats. With the introduction of the Canwest Global (now Shaw Media) television show \"Ice Pilots NWT\", Buffalo has expanded its clothing company to feature over 30 products and launched a full service product website called BuffaloAirWear.com. The show, which is produced by Omnifilm Entertainment and shown on History, features the day-to-day operations at Buffalo Airways.\n\nIn 2011, Buffalo Airways was involved in a recreation of the historic Dam Busters raids of World War II, flying the mission, with their own plane and pilots. Buffalo dropped an inert reproduction of the 'Upkeep' bouncing bomb from their Douglas DC-4. The project was documented in the television show \"Dambusters Fly Again\" in Canada, \"Dambusters: Building the Bouncing Bomb\" in the UK, and \"Nova\" season 39 episode \"Bombing Hitler's Dams\" in the US. A behind-the-scenes look was also filmed in the \"Ice Pilots NWT\" season 3 episode 2 show \"Dambusters\".\n\nIn 2012, \"Arctic Air\", a Canadian aviation drama, used Buffalo Airways hangar as a backdrop for scenes in the show. During a tour of Buffalo Airways' hangar, given by Director of Operations, Mikey McBryan, he explained how the TV show used tarps to cover the Buffalo Airways insignia.\n\nOn 27 July 2012, Bruce Dickinson, lead singer of Iron Maiden, flew up from Edmonton to Yellowknife with Buffalo Airways. On 28 July, Dickinson, who holds an airline transport pilot licence, flew a Douglas DC-3 to Yellowknife and spent a day as a guest star for a season five episode.\n\nIn August 2019, owner Joe McBryan was made a member of the Order of the Northwest Territories to honour his work in aviation.\n\nBuffalo operates a courier service as Buffalo Air Express which started in 1982-1983. It offers service throughout the Northwest Territories (NWT) and Northern Alberta. In association with Global Interline Network it can ship around the world from bases in Yellowknife, Edmonton and Hay River.\n\nUnder contract for the NWT Government, Buffalo Airways operate and maintain aircraft used in the aerial firefighting program. Aircraft include both bird dog and waterbombers. The waterbombers are assisted by smaller aircraft known as \"bird dogs\" which are used to help spot wildfires as well as guide waterbombers during operations\n\nCurrent water bomber aircraft include eight amphibious Air Tractor 802 Fireboss and two specially converted Lockheed L-188 Electra. Bird Dog aircraft include the Gulfstream/Rockwell 690, and the Beech King Air.\n\nFormer aircraft used include the amphibious Canadair CL-215, the Douglas C-54/DC-4, and the Canso PBY-5.\n\nBuffalo's aviation school offers an aircraft maintenance engineer program and several other courses. According to Transport Canada listings, it has three aircraft, two are single-engine fixed wing, an Aeronca Champion and a Fleet Canuck, the third a helicopter is a Robinson R22. The Buffalo website also lists a Bell 206 helicopter and a Beech 90 King Air.\n\nThe airline operated scheduled passenger services between Hay River and Yellowknife from August 1986 until November 2015. However, due to the suspension of the Air Operator Certificate scheduled service was replaced in December 2015, when the company chartered aircraft to make the run. The charter service was cancelled 24 December. As of Spring 2019 Buffalo has not resumed passenger service, and currently does not have trained flight attendants making passenger service unlikely in the near future. It carried over 186,000 passengers from 1986 to 2015. Scheduled cargo services transport supplies from Yellowknife to Deline, Fort Good Hope, Norman Wells, and Tulita under contract with the Government of the Northwest Territories. The service also includes an airport shuttle and a medical transfer bus. Buffalo also offers charters on their passenger aircraft across Canada and also offers cargo charters.\n\nAs of August 2019, according to Transport Canada the fleet numbered 57, with two more aircraft registered to the Buffalo School of Aviation. In addition the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had one aircraft registered to Buffalo Airways USA.\n\nThe Buffalo Airways web site lists a Canso and is listed, since 2013, by Transport Canada as being owned by Exploits Valley Air Services.\n\nThis Buffalo Airways DC-3 flew on D-Day dropping paratroopers over Normandy as part of 512 Squadron. KG330 left RAF Broadwell for Operation Tonga at precisely 23:15. It would have been part of 'C' flight as it crossed the English Channel towards its drop zone. The exact location for the drop was inland between Cabourg and Ouistreham just north of the heavily defended city of Caen. It would be dropping the 9th Parachute Battalion as part of the 6th Airborne Division. The paratroopers it was dropping were sent to destroy a heavy coastal battery and to position themselves on the canal between Caen and the port at Ouistreham. The coastal defence had earlier been successfully bombed by 100 Avro Lancaster bombers of RAF Bomber Command. The visibility is said to have been good, no casualties were reported and the aircraft returned to base at 03:35.\n\nOn 30 November 2015, Transport Canada suspended Buffalo Airways' Air Operator Certificate, citing the airline's poor safety record. This prohibited Buffalo Airways from operating commercial air services, until it could prove that it is capable of meeting all safety regulations on a consistent basis. Service was maintained using chartered aircraft. On 12 January 2016, the licence was reinstated.\n\nBuffalo Airways has nine accidents listed by the Aviation Safety Network, none of which had any fatalities. In addition to the Aviation Safety network, there are two more reported incidents that were investigated by the Transportation Board of Canada.

The first men's basketball game in the arena featured an 80–70 Ohio victory over the Indiana Hoosiers on December 3, 1968. The arena houses offices for the Ohio Athletics Department, numerous coaches' offices, team locker rooms, and athletic training rooms. Additionally it houses offices and classrooms for the computer science branch of the Russ College of Engineering. Over the years, there have been numerous renovations, some of the most recent being in 1997, where improved lighting, an expanded press row, and a wider camera deck were added to the arena. Also, The Vern and Marion Alden Basketball Suite which houses offices and meeting rooms for Ohio men's and women's basketball was completed. A few years later, the locker rooms for both basketball teams were expanded and given new furniture, carpeting, and individual wooden lockers. Following the 2004 season, more renovations occurred as a new playing surface was installed and two large Daktronics video boards were added to the venue.\n\nThe Convocation Center's atmosphere has helped the Bobcats to win over 75% of their home games since the opening of The Convo in 1968. At the beginning of the 2001–2002 season, a new student cheering section, dubbed the \"O Zone,\" was started for men's basketball games.\n\nThe Convocation Center brought in its largest crowd on February 28, 1970, when 14,102 fans were in attendance to watch the Bobcats men's basketball team defeat the Bowling Green Falcons 77–76. That year Ohio finished 20–5, winning the Mid-American Conference title and advancing to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn addition to Ohio basketball, volleyball, and wrestling contests, the Convo hosts numerous other events annually. The facility has held local high school basketball games as well as high school state tournament games as well as a variety of concerts, including a May 17, 1969 concert by Led Zeppelin, professional wrestling events, and special university events, most notably Ohio University's graduation ceremonies.\n\nThe Convocation Center was used for Thursday night rehearsals for The Ohio University Marching 110 when the weather caused temperatures to drop far too low for these late-night sessions. The band used these rehearsals to learn/polish dance routines for their home football games on the basketball court. The building was also used for several of the Marching 110's LP recording sessions in the 1970s, 80s and 90s.\n\nOhio University Athletics Director Jim Schaus announced plans to renovate the Convocation Center athletic training center by 2012 as part of the Bobcat Renaissance, which is an initiative geared toward improving OU's athletic programs.\n\nThe arena has also hosted some WCW events.\n\n\n"}

The center of this circular area is the fovea. The fovea and a small area surrounding it are not supplied by the central retinal artery or its branches, but instead by the choroid.\n\nThe central retinal artery is approximately 160 micrometres in diameter.\n\nIn some cases - approximately 20% of the population - there is a branch of the ciliary circulation called the cilio-retinal artery which supplies the retina between the macula and the optic nerve, including the nerve fibers from the foveal photoreceptors. If this artery is present, the central vision will be preserved even in case of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).\n\nThe central retinal artery is formed from the proximal part of the hyaloid artery after atrophy of its distal part has formed the hyaloid canal.\n\nThe central retinal artery supplies blood to all the nerve fibers that form the optic nerve, which carries the visual information to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, including those that reach over the fovea. Its blood flow can be revealed by fluorescein angiography or laser Doppler imaging .\n\nThus if the central retinal artery gets occluded, there is complete loss of vision in that eye even though the fovea is not affected. The entire retina (with the exception of the fovea) becomes pale and swollen and opaque while the central fovea still appears reddish (this is because the choroid color shows through). This is the basis of the famous \"Cherry red spot\" seen on examination of the retina on funduscopy of a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).\n\nHowever it should be remembered that the Cilio retinal artery itself is a branch of the Short Posterior Ciliary Arteries which is derived from the Ophthalmic Artery. Therefore, its possible for the cilio retinal artery itself to occlude causing significant visual loss in the perfused macula region (surrounding visual field will remain intact).\n\nIn dogs, it is the continuation of the long ciliary artery.\n\n"}

The manufacturing company, a subsidiary of the Croatian ARMA-GRUPA Corporation, has been manufacturing the ERO and Mini-ERO submachine guns (copies of the Israeli UZI and Mini-UZI respectively) since the mid-1990s. \n\nThe manufacturer tried to push the APS-95 on the international market for several years with no success.\n\nThe APS-95 was developed under request of the Croatian Army, which wanted to shift as soon as possible from the then-issued Yugoslavian-made 7.62×39mm Zastava M70 assault rifles to a service rifle chambered for the NATO-standard 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge. \n\nDuring the Croatian War of Independence, the Croatian side had been supplied by the Croatian businessman Antun Kikaš with several batches of the Vektor R4, a South African copy of the Israeli IMI Galil assault rifle. The Croatian fighters appreciated the weapon and wanted a locally manufactured version of it as the new standard Croatian Army rifle.\n\nThe APS-95 was officially adopted by the Croatian Army around 1993, acquired and distributed in very small quantities before budgetary constraints stopped procurement.\n\nWhile the APS-95 was not entirely adopted in the Croatian Army, some of them were used in the Yugoslav Wars.\n\nThe APS-95 was a conventional select-fire assault rifle operating via a gas-driven piston and employing a 35-rounds detachable magazine for 5.56mm ammunition, in all similar to the ones used in the Israeli \"Galil\" or South-African \"R4\" assault rifles. The APS-95 was made around a stamped receiver, rather than the refined milled receiver of the Galil and R4, thus achieving reduction in cost and manufacturing time. \n\nIts fire selector was based upon two distinct commands located on both sides of the rifle, similarly to the Galil and Vektor R4 but different in operation. They consist of P (Pojedinacno or semi-auto), R (Rafalno or full auto) and Z (Zakoceno or Safe).\n\nThe lever located on the right side of the receiver, based upon the AK-47 selector, consisted of three modes. \n\nThe small switch located over the grip on the left side of the receiver, at easy thumb reach, had two positions for semi-automatic and full-automatic fire. The folding stock was made out of stamped steel, and folded on the right side of the receiver; its profile didn't caused any hindrance to the handling of the weapon nor to the operation of the bolt - as such, the APS-95 could be safely fired with the stock folded.\n\nThe most prominent features of the APS-95 over the Galil and the R4 were its distinctive handguard and front sight, and its carrying handle integrating a 1.5× optical sight and optional backup back iron sights. The pistol grip was also different, featuring finger grooves, much in the style of the M16 rifle The use of polymer magazines issued with the weapon indicates that it's likely from South African sources.\n"}

{"id": "2182905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182905", "title": "Rocky Mountain Cup", "text": "Rocky Mountain Cup\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Cup is a soccer trophy contested between Real Salt Lake and the Colorado Rapids. The cup is awarded by the Committee of 10, a group of bi-partisan fans who run the competition, to the team with the most points in games played between the two. The teams are awarded 3 points for each win and 1 point for each tie in regular season MLS games against each other. The Cup is awarded at the conclusion of the deciding game of the series between the two teams.\n\nIf the teams end the season in a points tie, the team with the most goals on aggregate will win (for a two-team competition, this is equivalent to goal differential). If the teams are tied on aggregate goals, the current holders retain the Cup for another year.\n\nThe cup was created in 2005, the first year of play for Real Salt Lake.\n\nWhen it was officially announced that Salt Lake City would be awarded an MLS expansion club, fans from Utah and Colorado founded the bi-partisan Committee of 10 (5 supporters from each club) and began to outline the official rules of the competition. The contest was named the Rocky Mountain Cup after a vote from the fans, and a trophy was acquired.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Cup began on April 16, 2005 at Real Salt Lake's inaugural home game, in which Real earned their first-ever win with a 1–0 victory. Colorado eventually won the trophy in 2005 after besting Real in the three subsequent matches that season, officially clinching the Cup at their final meeting of the year at Rice-Eccles Stadium.\n\nPrior to the 2006 MLS season, the two clubs swapped players in a trade, exchanging forward Jeff Cunningham and midfielder Clint Mathis. The repercussions of the trade surfaced in an August 10 match in which RSL humiliated Colorado 4–1 at INVESCO Field, punctuated by a stellar performance by Cunningham in which he earned two goals and an assist.\n\nThe Rapids would have their revenge later that year during a very heated match in Salt Lake City on September 2. The affair saw numerous hard fouls and seven yellow cards. Fans showered the field with debris and missiles throughout the game. Colorado would grind out a 1–0 victory and secure the Rocky Mountain Cup for the second consecutive year. A myriad of controversy erupted after the game as the Rapids celebrated with the trophy. Rapids captain Pablo Mastroeni removed his shirt, stuffed it down his shorts, and began making gestures at the Salt Lake fans. RSL owner Dave Checketts then came on to the field and confronted Mastroeni in an angry verbal exchange which was later broken up by players and officials. Much to the ire of Real fans, the League did not take action for Mastroeni's controversial behavior.\n\nThe 2007 competition kicked off with the Rapids earning a comfortable 2–0 win on the road. After the match, Colorado midfielder Kyle Beckerman made remarks towards RSL supporters and their reaction towards the controversy of the previous September: \"It definitely comes from their fans. They run their mouths the whole game. If they don't want us to celebrate, win the game.\"\n\nThe next meeting between the teams, a 1-1 draw on May 10, finished with a bizarre distinction of being the only draw in MLS history in which only own-goals were scored. Later that year, on July 16, the two clubs exchanged Kyle Beckerman and Mehdi Ballouchy. This trade proved particularly controversial for Rapids supports and further deteriorated their relationship with Colorado head coach Fernando Clavijo.\n\nReal Salt Lake would then even the 2007 series in September, forcing the deciding match in Colorado a month later on the final game of the season. Both teams were all but mathematically ruled out of the MLS Cup Playoffs, leaving the October 20 contest largely a match for pride. The Rapids needed only a draw to secure the cup for a third year, but Real grabbed a late win when Robbie Findley scored in the 87th minute. The victory for Real Salt Lake won the club their first Rocky Mountain Cup, and also brought a painful end to one of Colorado's worst-ever seasons.\n\n2008 would play out in similar fashion to the previous year. The deciding match was again at Dick's Sporting Goods Park on the final day of the season. However, the stakes were higher, with a win for either side guaranteeing a playoff spot along with the Rocky Mountain Cup (Real could also prevail with a draw). Colorado pulled ahead and held a 1–0 lead into the closing seconds of the game, but Yura Movsisyan scored a clutch stoppage-time goal to end the game with a 1–1 draw. The result was quite possibly RSL's greatest moment in club history: retaining the Cup for a second year, clinching their first-ever postseason berth, and denying Rapids of the playoffs on their own turf. Salt Lake fans celebrated by throwing a number of smoke bombs onto the pitch after the final whistle, adding insult to injury for the stunned Colorado supporters.\n\nThe 2010 edition of the Rocky Mountain Cup played out as close and exciting as the previous three seasons. In the first leg, held September 27 at RSL's Rio Tinto Stadium, Real Salt Lake fielded a squad of mostly reserves in the middle of a busy stretch of their schedule including 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League group stage matches. Coach Jason Kreis rested most of the starters in anticipation of an opportunity to clinch a berth in the CCL knockout round three days later. Conor Casey gave Colorado a 1–0 lead in the 36th minute. The result looked like it would hold until former Rapids defender Nat Borchers headed in a service from Andy Williams in the 93rd minute for the 1–1 draw. The second leg would finish in an even more exciting fashion. The teams returned to Dick's Sporting Goods Park for the final match of the regular season on October 23. Both teams had already clinched playoff spots. RSL needed a win or tie to have a chance at winning the Supporter's Shield. Colorado appeared to dash those hopes with a 16th-minute goal by Omar Cummings and a 51st-minute header by Conor Casey. Rapids fans were ready to celebrate their first Rocky Mountain Cup in 4 years while carrying a 2–0 lead into stoppage time. RSL forward Alvaro Saborio scored twice in stoppage time – first on a blocked clearance from Colorado keeper Matt Pickens in the 91st minute, and second on a penalty in the 95th minute after Drew Moor pulled RSL defender Jamison Olave down in the box on an RSL free kick. The resulting 2–2 draw gave RSL the Rocky Mountain Cup for the 4th consecutive season due to being the previous year's winner. Conditions after the match became ugly when several RSL players made obscene gestures towards the Colorado supporter's terrace and were consequently showered with beer cups and other projectiles. The draw would prove to be beneficial for Colorado, as it put them in the easier Eastern Conference bracket for the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs in which Colorado won its first ever MLS Cup.\n\nTiebreakers: 1) Goal Difference, 2) Away Goals (prior to 2008, when teams played an equal number of home games; never used), 3) Previous Year Winners retain Cup\n\n\"The two sides have yet to meet in the MLS Cup Playoffs\"\n\n\"The two sides have yet to meet in the CONCACAF Champions League or Leagues Cup\"\n\n\nAs of 2017, nine players have played for both teams in the Rocky Mountain Cup. This was notably started by a trade between the two teams in 2007, in which Colorado's Kyle Beckerman was traded to Salt Lake for Mehdi Ballouchy, both of whom became regular contributors for their new clubs. The trade also corresponded with Salt Lake's control of the Rocky Mountain Cup for many years. In addition, Nat Borchers, Jeff Cunningham, Atiba Harris, Richie Kotschau, Clint Mathis, Chris Wingert, and Luis Gil have also faced off on both sides of the rivalry. \n\nThe Committee of 10, or C10, was initially formed through discussions between fans from both Real Salt Lake and the Colorado Rapids on BigSoccer.com and on the now defunct fan forums at RealSaltLake.org. It was decided that each team's fans would be represented by five individuals per side. These representatives would be responsible for creating the guidelines, design, and ultimately raising the funds to create the Rocky Mountain Cup. \n\nThe Original Committee of 10\n\n"}

His best known work is derived from interpretations of the music from Spaghetti Westerns, especially his cover version of Ennio Morricone's main theme from the 1966 film \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\". He composed the musical score for the 1969 Western \"Charro!\" which starred Elvis Presley.\n\nMontenegro was born in New York City in 1925. He served in the U.S. Navy for two years, mostly as an arranger for the Newport Naval Base band in Newport, Rhode Island. After the war he attended Manhattan College while studying composition and leading his own band for school dances.\n\nIn the middle 1950s, he was directing, conducting, and arranging the orchestra for Eliot Glen and Irving Spice on their Dragon and Caprice labels. It was he who was directing the Glen-Spice Orchestra on Dion DiMucci's first release when Dion was backed by Dragon recording artists, the Timberlanes. Released on Mohawk #105 in 1957, the songs were \"Out In Colorado\" and \"The Chosen Few\", which were soon issued on the Jubilee label for better distribution.\n\nHe was later hired by Time Records as a musical director producing a series of albums for the label, and moved to Los Angeles in the early 1960s where he began working for RCA Victor, producing a series of albums and soundtracks for motion pictures and television themes, such as two volumes of \"Music From The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\", an album of cover versions of spy music themes \"Come Spy With Me\" and an album of cover versions of Ennio Morricone's music for the Clint Eastwood \"The Man With No Name\" series of spaghetti Westerns that led to major chart hits.\n\nMontenegro began scoring motion pictures with the instrumental music from \"Advance to the Rear\" in 1964. Following the success of his albums, he was contracted by Columbia Pictures where he scored such films as \"Hurry Sundown\" (1967), \"Lady in Cement\" (1968), \"The Undefeated\" (1969), \"Viva Max!\" (1969) and the Matt Helm films \"The Ambushers\" (1967) and \"The Wrecking Crew\" (1968). He composed the musical score and conducted the recording sessions for the 1969 Elvis Presley Western film \"Charro!\" (1969), and he provided some incidental music for the cult 1970 British film \"Toomorrow\". His last film scores were for the exploitation film \"Too Hot to Handle\" and the cult action thriller \"The Farmer\", in 1977.\n\n\"The Farmer\" (1977) with Montenegro's chilling electronic music score earned an X rating until producer/director David Berlatsky had the review board review the film again without the music score and the rating was changed from X to R, which allowed Columbia pictures to distribute the film for 17 years. The music rights in order to release a DVD sale could not be obtained as the estate could not be found, the score is considered \"lost\".\n\nMontenegro was also contracted to Columbia's television production company Screen Gems where he is most famous for his theme from the second season of the television series \"I Dream of Jeannie\", his theme song \"Seattle\" and music from \"Here Come the Brides\" and \"The Outcasts\". He also composed the music for the long running \"The Partridge Family,\" (1970). During the mid‑1960s he started producing some of the most renowned works from the space age pop era, featuring electronics and rock in albums such as \"Moog Power\" and \"Mammy Blue\".\n\nMontenegro's electronic works were decisive and influential for the future generations of electronic musicians, giving a retro/futuristic edge by the use of the Moog synthesizer, and helped to push its popularity. He will be also remembered by his versions of classics such as the main theme to Sergio Leone's film \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\", originally composed by Ennio Morricone. This was Montenegro's biggest pop hit, reaching #2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, #3 in the Canadian RPM Magazine charts, and spending four weeks atop the UK Singles Chart in 1968. It sold over one and a quarter million copies and was awarded a gold disc.\n\nHis version of the main theme from \"Hang 'em High\" reached #59 in Canada. In 1968, his hit \"Aces High\" placed at #11 on the Billboard Year End Chart of the Top Hits of 1968.\n\nIn the late 1970s severe emphysema forced an end to his musical career, and he died of the disease in 1981. He is buried at Welwood Murray Cemetery in Palm Springs, California.\n\n\n"}

Silicides are structurally closer to borides than to carbides.\n\nSimilar to borides and carbides, the composition of silicides cannot be easily specified as covalent molecules. The chemical bonds in silicides range from conductive metal-like structures to covalent or ionic. Silicides of all non-transition metals, with exception of beryllium, have been described.\n\nSilicon atoms in silicides can have many possible organizations:\n\nA silicide prepared by a self-aligned process is called a salicide. This is a process in which silicide contacts are formed only in those areas in which deposited metal (which after annealing becomes a metal component of the silicide) is in direct contact with silicon, hence, the process is self-aligned. It is commonly implemented in MOS/CMOS processes for ohmic contacts of the source, drain, and poly-Si gate..\n\nGroup 1 and 2 silicides e.g. NaSi and CaSi react with water, yielding hydrogen and/or silanes.\n\nWhen magnesium silicide is placed into hydrochloric acid, HCl(aq), the gas silane, SiH, is produced. This gas is the silicon analogue of methane, CH, but is more reactive. Silane is pyrophoric, that is, due to the presence of oxygen, it spontaneously combusts in air:\n\nThese reactions are typical of a Group 2 silicide. MgSi reacts similarly with sulfuric acid. Group 1 silicides are even more reactive. For example, sodium silicide, NaSi, reacts rapidly with water to yield sodium silicate, NaSiO, and hydrogen gas. Rubidium silicide is pyrophoric, igniting in contact with air.\n\nThe transition metal silicides are, in contrast, usually inert to aqueous solutions of everything with exception of hydrofluoric acid; however, they react with more aggressive agents, e.g. melted potassium hydroxide, or fluorine and chlorine when red-hot.\n\nMercury, thallium, bismuth, and lead are immiscible with liquid silicon.\n\n\n"}

One critic wrote, “Stepping into The Hieroglyph of the Human Soul, the visitor is transported into a liminal space of consciousness that is at once a library and a temple, a stage and a studio, a cave painting and a cathedral. In this place of strange convergence, McCloskey performs the simultaneous roles of artist and critic, actor and director, shaman and prophet. Like Thoth-Hermes, McCloskey is both author and librarian of a living language.”\n\nHe began work on The Hieroglyph of the Human Soul in response to the September 11 attacks. He said, \"“The coming down of the Twin Towers is what triggered The Hieroglyph of the Human Soul… [It’s] the falling away of the old binary: the two brothers, the Piscean fish. One [is] the man of god, the [other is the] man of money. The two kings who grow higher and higher like the Tower of Babel, only in jealousy to fall back to earth—and we are left in the rubble.”\"\n\nSome interesting synchronicities have revealed themselves in \"The Hieroglyph of the Human Soul\". McCloskey discovered that the colors appear to be in 3D when viewed with ChromaDepth 3D glasses, creating an immersive multidimensional effect. He said, \"\"I wasn't expecting it to be 3D; I didn't figure out how to do it. It was inherent in the questions I was asking, as if consciousness itself is saying, 'You see, I'm far more clever than you think I am, because you think I'm as clever as you are, and you're not that clever.'\"\"\n\nAnother interesting synchronicity is that the acronym of \"The Hieroglyph of the Human Soul\" is T.H.O.T.H.S., alluding to the Thoth, the ancient Egyptian god of wisdom, writing, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art, judgment, and the dead. McCloskey has called the work \"Thoth's library.\"\n\n\"The Hieroglyph of the Human Soul\" is composed in what McCloskey calls \"Watcher Language.\" In 2003, the Watcher Language was granted copyright as a graphic language.\n\nHis painting Phoenix Arise was the focus of a 2012 TEDx talk that McCloskey presented in Malibu, CA.Images from McCloskey's Codex Tor were featured on the cover and sleeve of Flying Lotus’ 2010 multi-award-winning album \"Cosmogramma\".\n\nImagery from McCloskey’s Grimoire (itself an unused prop from the E. Elias Merhige horror film \"Shadow of the Vampire\") was prominently featured on The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour in the 2000s.\n\nIn 2003, McCloskey published the book \"Tarot ReVisioned\" through Olandar Press. It serves as an exegesis for his pen-drawn black-and-white interpretation of the Hermetic Tarot. In it, he discusses \"paths of initiation, myth of origins and the profound philosophical implications of symbolism, Hermeticism, alchemy and the Grail.\"\n\nUpon its publication, American occult historian Mitch Horowitz likened \"Tarot ReVisioned\" to Manly P. Hall's classic esoteric tome \"The Secret Teaching of All Ages\".\n\nMcCloskey has also published \"Codex Tor I & II\" (which served as the cover for Flying Lotus' \"Cosmogramma\"), \"Adam Reborn & Eve Restored\", and \"In the Splendor\".\n\nMcCloskey considers himself a “visual philosopher.”\n\nWhile speaking on aesthetics, McCloskey remarked, \"“True beauty is Saturnian… [S]he says, ‘You have earned me. You have not been entitled to me.’ Jupiter might have said, ‘Simply because you’re grand you can have me.’ But Saturn says, ‘No, I remain… the Devil, the Dweller at the Threshold, he who sees all of the weakness of your argument.’ [He] essentially torments you until you become worthy; no one can do it for you. You must become self-redeemed. [A]nd so doing you become honorable. You go from being a soldier—a coward of authority—to becoming a Grail Knight, worthy of great beauty because you honor not what you have taken but what you can finally see.”\"\n\nOn the subject of consciousness, McCloskey has said, \"\"The knowledge of the father is I think therefore I am, and the knowledge of the mother is I love therefore I am… That is the right angle of the human heart: When I think, I think I am not you. When I love, I know we are one.\"\"\n\nOf the human condition, McCloskey states, \"“Only when you return to what is intimate in your human heart can you find the truth that you are not alone, but that you are in all ages simultaneously, and you are woven of the entire whole and holy story of being human.”\"\n\nMcCloskey lives in Malibu, CA with his wife Carla. They host public events at their home including workshops, film screenings, and internationally recognized speakers. During these events, McCloskey gives personal tours of \"The Hieroglyph of the Human Soul\".\n\nFor the past 40 years, the McCloskeys have hosted weekly discussion groups at their home, with topics ranging from Theosophy to Jungian psychology.\n\nIn 2018, McCloskey's home was threatened during the Woolsey Fire. With the help of fellow soap opera star A Martinez, McCloskey was able to defend his home from destruction by the fire.\n\n"}

Ron Hubbard included space opera narratives in his writings, wherein thetans (the name given to human souls) were reincarnated periodically over quadrillions of years, retaining memories of prior lives, to which Hubbard attributed complex narratives about life throughout the universe. The most controversial of these myths is the story of Xenu, to whom Hubbard attributed responsibility for many of the world's problems. \n\nSome space opera doctrines of Scientology are only provided by the church to experienced members, who church leaders maintain are the only ones able to correctly understand them. Several former members of the church have exposed these secret documents, leading to lengthy court battles with the church, which failed to keep the secret. Critics of the church have noted that some of the narratives are scientifically impossible, and have thus assailed the church as untrustworthy for teaching them. The space opera teachings have also been satirized in popular culture. Scholars of religion have described the space opera narratives as a creation myth designed to encourage reverence of Hubbard as a supreme messenger. Several academics have drawn attention to the similarity of the space opera myths to themes of the 1950s Cold War culture in which they were constructed.\n\n(Although this article regularly refers to Xenu, Hubbard in many of his lectures and writings actually uses the name Xemu).\n\nL. Ron Hubbard created a form of therapy known as Dianetics, which he promoted as a scientific, not religious, teaching. Until the early 1950s, he had a negative view of organized religions, but thereafter discussed spiritual topics. In these teachings, he identified subconscious memories of past events, which he called \"engrams\", as causes of human dissatisfaction. By 1950, he had begun to ponder past lives, believing that they could be recalled; he attempted to use these recollections to develop a comprehensive narrative of the universe. He founded the Church of Scientology in 1953, advancing his beliefs as religious doctrines. The church was distinct from Dianetics-based groups but incorporated some of their views. Hubbard saw Dianetics as focused on the physical body but viewed Scientology as a way to address spiritual matters.\n\nIn Hubbard's efforts to shift from a psychotherapeutic to a spiritual program, he introduced the concept of thetans: a set of godlike, non-corporeal entities capable of creating and shaping universes, later trapped in the MEST and confined, by reincarnation, to physical bodies. Hugh Urban of Ohio State University states that these teachings bear similarities to Gnosticism, although he doubts that Hubbard was well versed in Gnostic thought.\n\nIn the 1950s, as Hubbard's followers recalled their past lives, he recorded many details of these recollections. With this as his source, he constructed an intricate history of the universe, identified as \"space opera\". Although Hubbard believed that he had developed a comprehensive history, Urban cites the isolated and incomplete record of the statements, wherein Hubbard identified a thetan universe, separate from the material universe, created by its inhabitants. The material universe, in Hubbard's view, began when other universes created by thetans collided, from which they entered the material universe in six invasion groups roughly 60 trillion years ago. Hubbard also described a series of events, called the \"incidents\", that divorced the thetans from their self-knowledge, but maintained that thetans could regain their former divinity, and referred to thetans that freed themselves from the material world as \"operating thetans\".\n\nHubbard located his first 'incident' four quadrillion years ago, in which a thetan encountered 'loud cracks and brightness' and then observed a cherub and chariot before experiencing total darkness. In Scientology, this is known as \"Incident 1\". Another important event in Scientology's chronology of the universe occurred on a space city known as Arslycus, the inhabitants of whom brought about an incident when capturing thetans.\n\nThe most controversial portion of Scientology's space opera is the myth of Xenu, known as \"Incident 2\", in which Hubbard described a group of 76 planets, orbiting stars visible from Earth, organized in a Galactic Confederacy c. 75 million years ago, ruled by the dictator Xenu. The confederacy having become overpopulated, Xenu sent several billion of his citizens onto DC 8 planes to the planet Teegeeack (Earth), ostensibly for tax audition. There, hydrogen bombs were detonated inside volcanoes, killing the exiles, whose thetans were brainwashed on Hawaii and the Canary Islands, introducing various myths, such as the myth of Jesus, to conceal the thetans' origins. Eventually, officers of the Galactic Confederacy launched a rebellion against Xenu, which continued for six years before capturing him and placing him in an electrified prison in the center of a mountain. Hubbard taught that the thetans brainwashed by Xenu's forces remained on Earth, where the \"body thetans\", attached to human psyches, contribute to human problems; and that individuals could be freed from these brainwashed thetans and thus attain a type of salvation.\n\nHubbard also taught that, upon the deaths of humans, thetans continued to \"implant stations\", including locations on planets near Earth, where their memories were erased and new memories emplaced. On grounds that some \"implant stations\" were better than others, Hubbard advised his followers to avoid the one on Venus. After passing an implant station, he taught, the thetan returned to Earth, where it was incarnated. Hubbard taught the Christian concept of heaven was based on a physical location on another planet, which he claimed to have visited. He compared its appearance to Busch Gardens in Pasadena, California, (actual location Van Nuys, California), and noted it contained effigies of characters from the New Testament. Over time, he recalled, the location fell into disrepair. A town nearby contained an implant station, at which thetans were convinced to return there.\n\nAnother significant encounter in Hubbard's narrative occurred when a large group of planets formed the Marcab Confederacy, described as in search of slaves, and called a \"decadent\" society. The author related that this civilization caused a significant implant upon their encounter with thetans.\n\nHubbard discussed the history of human civilizations on Earth, and the lives of ancient sea monsters and fish people, as well. He also said humans could recover memories of previous lives, such as the experiences of clams and Neanderthals. In his mythos, Atlantis was a completely electronic civilization, whose inhabitants possessed disintegration technology; in contrast, Earth was invaded by multiple groups around 1200 BCE, including the \"fifth invader force from Martian Command\" against the \"fourth invasion force from Space Command\" in battle.\n\nOn premise that thetans are forced to believe various faulty ideas, the church teaches that their courses allow \"theta beings\" to be freed from these beliefs and regain their former abilities. Committed Scientologists pursue courses and procedures offered by the church in the hope of gaining freedom and enlightenment, allegedly permitting travel around the solar system. The author referred to the process of a thetan leaving its human body as \"exteriorization\", which he said allowed for space travel. Urban notes that this is similar to Aleister Crowley's teachings of astral projection, although he adds that Hubbard did not use that term.\n\nA glossary on the Scientology website defined the term \"space opera\" as a description of actual events:\n\n\"Space opera has space travel, spaceships, spacemen, intergalactic travel, wars, conflicts, other beings, civilizations and societies, and other planets and galaxies. It is not fiction and concerns actual incidents.\"\n\nThe Scientology publication \"Have You Lived Before This Life\" contains some space opera, describing past lives—including some on warlike planets—which were recalled through auditing. In the 1960s, Hubbard introduced a series of questions, known as \"security checks\", to verify members' loyalty. Mikael Rothstein, associate professor of religious history at the University of Copenhagen, sees the Xenu myth as building off of, and the culmination of, these accounts. The Xenu myth was released to Scientologists in the late 1960s, after teachings about thetans and their relationship to the physical body had been disseminated; its release provided the cause and origin of many of the group's teachings. Rothstein describes \"space opera\" as \"Hubbard's introduction of a new reality, and new foundation for everything\".\n\nAlthough Hubbard spoke openly about space opera in the 1950s, Scientology eventually became an esoteric faith: some teachings are withheld until followers reach a certain point in their spiritual development, and the mythological foundation of the courses are unknown to many members. Over a decade of auditing and study—and donations of tens of thousands of dollars—are required for a member to reach the highest echelons of hidden knowledge. Followers below a certain level () of growth are denied access to the church's cosmological teachings, and they are given different explanations for the church's teachings. German scholar Gerald Willms notes that in addition to the esoteric foundations, Scientology cites practical justifications for its rituals, so they can be pursued without knowledge of advanced teachings. The Church of Scientology has attempted to prevent the public release of their esoteric teachings, but, through the internet, their confidential aspects have been widely released. The church considers public discussion of their space opera teachings offensive and has asked academics not to publish their details. Scientologists maintain that the true meaning of these texts is only accessible to those who have progressed through their courses, and that those who read them prematurely risk damage to their spiritual and physical conditions. Church leaders have sometimes outright refused to discuss the subject with journalists. Rothstein observes that the church also has a strong financial motivation to keep members from accessing higher level courses, as devotees are required to make large payments to obtain them. Free Zone Scientologists, however, are sometimes more open about space opera. Some Free Zone Scientologists believe that the Church of Scientology has been hijacked by undercover agents of the Marcabian Confederacy.\n\nDuring auditing, Scientology members sometimes recall details of life in space. Rothstein states that this is part of a \"mythological paradigm\" that members initially partake of through Scientology's scriptures. He notes, however, that some Scientologists do not believe that there are space opera myths in the group's teachings, and that others have left the group after learning about the higher-level doctrines. Reitman relates that some members accept the space opera teachings by seeing them as similar to seemingly implausible stories of popular religions or simply remain quiet about their doubts.\n\nRothstein states that space opera is a \"part of the total fabric of Scientological thinking and narrative, but not of prime importance.\" He argues that these teachings are a \"second order belief\", in that they exist to support the group's core teachings about thetans. Mike Rinder, a former spokesman of the Church of Scientology, stated that extraterrestrial auditing is merely \"a small percent\" of their canon.\n\nScientology's space opera teachings were publicized in accounts given by former church members, most notably during court cases. One such case was filed by a former Scientologist, Larry Wollersheim, against the church in 1980. Five years later, Wollersheim offered confidential Scientology materials, including space opera teachings, to the court as evidence, a move that was vigorously protested by the church's attorneys. They were unable to prevent disclosure, however, and the documents were published by the \"Los Angeles Times\" in November 1985. This was the first time that some aspects of Scientology's space opera teachings were offered as public evidence about the church. In the mid-1990s, Wollersheim published some of the materials on a website, prompting the church to sue his organization, FACTNet. The Church attested that the space opera narratives were trade secrets; this claim was rejected by the court.\n\nIn 1990, after being sued for libel by the Church of Scientology, Steven Fishman, a former member turned critic, offered a large amount of the group's highly confidential teachings in court. The documents, contained in what is known as the Fishman Affidavit, included detailed accounts of the church's space opera narratives. This material was subsequently posted on alt.religion.scientology and a website of Dutch journalist Karin Spaink. The church filed suits against those who posted the documents, claiming copyright violations. Lengthy court battles ensued, but the church was unable to prevent the materials' dissemination over the internet.\n\nFormer Scientologists and members of the anti-cult movement often discuss Scientology's space opera teachings. They generally take a rationalistic approach to the narratives and see them as absurd, or even as drug-fueled delusions, using them as a source of humor. The doctrines have been satirized in popular culture, most notably in the \"South Park\" episode \"Trapped in the Closet\". The anti-Scientology website Operation Clambake prominently uses space opera doctrines in their criticisms of the church, casting the implausibility of the stories as a clear reason to reject the group. Anti-cult critics of Scientology argue that the content of these teachings demonstrates that Scientology misleads its followers; many aspects of the narratives, such as the age of the volcanoes that Xenu is said to have used, contradict scientific consensus. The space opera teachings are, in fact, incompatible with scientific consensus on the age of the universe: around 14 billion years. Rothstein notes that scholars of religion usually do not pursue this line of analysis because all myths contain unscientific content; he notes that cultural conditioning determines whether religious narratives appear reasonable.\n\nRothstein argues that in the construction of the space opera narratives, Hubbard drew from tropes common to his audience. The concept of a Galactic Confederation, Rothstein observes, was present in other UFO religions of the 1950s;\n\n\nGrünschloß speculates the UFO-contact narratives may have played a role in the group's development of space opera, specifically citing the resemblance of Hubbard's description of life in Xenu's time to statements by George Adamski, a UFO contactee of the 1950s. Rothstein notes the group's teachings about extraterrestrials varies greatly from most of the UFO movement, particularly in Hubbard's descriptions of demonic characters.\n\nHubbard was a science fiction writer before starting Scientology, and some aspects of the church's space opera bear similarities to his previous writings. Noting similarities between Hubbard's fiction writing and creation of religious myths, Rothstein argues; \"perhaps no division between such categories should be made\". Kent posits some of his cosmology, such as the priests and psychiatrists loyal to Xenu, were modeled after events in Hubbard's life, such as his distaste for Christianity and clashes with the psychiatric establishment. Hubbard theorized science fiction writers sometimes recalled portions of events from past lives and incorporated it into their works, and Urban writes Hubbard's science fiction writings \"contain more than a few seeds of Hubbard's religious movement, the Church of Scientology\".\n\nRothstein argues Scientology's space opera identify Xenu as the root of evil and Hubbard as the hero, for having uncovered the mysteries of the universe. Rothstein states the group's teachings about \"salvation\" may be a means to encourage reverence of Hubbard. In addition, Rothstein notes the space opera teachings also provide fundamental justifications for some practical aspects of Scientology, including the rejection of psychiatry and the formation of the Sea Org. He sees space opera as similar to most types of mythology, involving superhuman beings in the far distant past. Willms states the mythology of Scientology differs from many other religions because it focuses on material beings; but argues the Xenu myth is a religious narrative, although the Church of Scientology has never used this claim in their efforts to be recognized as a religion.\n\n\n"}

Heiligendamm is part of the town Bad Doberan in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and historically belongs to Mecklenburg.\n\nThe cluster of resort architecture mansions and spa buildings at the seafront are reminders of the glory days when this part of the Baltic Sea was one of the playgrounds of Europe's aristocracy. Due to the classicist white buildings lining the beach promenade, the town is also known as the \"White Pearl\" () or the \"White Town by the Sea\" ().\n\nToday, the area by the sea is occupied by a five-star hotel, the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm. A narrow-gauge steam railway, known as the \"Molli\", links Heiligendamm with Kühlungsborn and Bad Doberan.\n\nHeiligendamm was developed as an elegant meeting place for the nobility and high society. Among its most prominent guests were the German Emperors.\n\nIts founder and first guest in 1793 was the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg Friedrich Franz I; he made the resort fashionable. Between 1793 and 1870, Johann Christoph, Heinrich von Seydwitz, Carl Theodor Severin, and Gustav Adolph Demmler created a veritable Gesamtkunstwerk for bathing and lodging. Heiligendamm was always regarded as the most elegant seaside resort in Germany. Nobility from throughout Europe used it as a summer getaway well into the 20th century.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the buildings of Heiligendamm were used as sanatoria and recovery ward. When Mecklenburg became part of the communist GDR, some of Heiligendamm's famous buildings were demolished and replaced by more utilitarian structures. After the German reunification in 1989/1990, a group of investors bought most of the buildings and undertook a major programme of refurbishment. \n\nA new company, the Kempinski Grand Hotel, opened in spring of 2003 - it used six historical buildings including the historical \"Kurhaus\" at the beach of Heiligendamm. The development has led to some conflict with residents, as main streets and cycle paths have been removed or rerouted. Also again a famous building of the ensemble was demolished. The mansion next to the Grand Hotel was reconstructed until 2011, though. Renovations of other mansions are undergoing or planned.\n\nOn July 13, 2006, United States President George W. Bush stayed at Heiligendamm while on a state visit to see German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Stralsund.\n\nOn June 6 to 8, 2007, Heiligendamm's Grand Hotel hosted the 33rd summit of G8 leaders. During this time, thousands of anticapitalist activists from around the world blocked the roads to Heiligendamm and an estimated 25,000 anti-globalization protesters demonstrated in nearby Rostock.\n\nIn July 2013, the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm was bought by Hannover-based accountant Paul Morzynski, who intends to carefully extend and reorganize the hotel.\n\nThe resort architecture near the beaches of Heiligendamm, consisting of classicist and historicist mansions and spa buildings, is part of a unique heritage, as the first such buildings of the European continent can be seen here. The area of the Grand Hotel is partly accessible to visitors, but should be experienced respectfully to not disturb the hotel guests.\n\nThe narrow gauge railway known as \"Bäderbahn Molli\" (\"Molli Resort Railway\") runs through Heiligendamm from Kühlungsborn to Bad Doberan. The line between Bad Doberan and Heiligendamm was built in 1886. The \"Protestant Forest Church\" (\"Evangelische Waldkirche\") was renovated after die Wende, the \"Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart\" (\"Herz-Jesu-Kapelle\") is close by.\n\nHeiligendamm also has a 200-metre-long pier into the Baltic Sea that allows great views of the \"White Pearl Mansions\" at the beach.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2182993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182993", "title": "Shaped canvas", "text": "Shaped canvas\n\nShaped canvases are paintings that depart from the normal flat, rectangular configuration. Canvases may be shaped by altering their outline, while retaining their flatness. An ancient, traditional example is the \"tondo\", a painting on a round panel or canvas: Raphael, as well as some other Renaissance painters, sometimes chose this format for madonna paintings. Alternatively, canvases may be altered by losing their flatness and assuming a three-dimensional surface. Or, they can do both. That is, they can assume shapes other than rectangles, and also have surface features that are three-dimensional. Arguably, changing the surface configuration of the painting transforms it into a sculpture. But shaped canvases are generally considered paintings.\n\nApart from any aesthetic considerations, there are technical matters, having to do with the very nature of canvas as a material, that tend to support the flat rectangle as the norm for paintings on canvas. (See Departing from the rectangular below.)\n\nIn the literature of art history and criticism, the term \"shaped canvas\" is particularly associated with certain works created mostly in New York after about 1960, during a period when a great variety and quantity of such works were produced. According to the commentary at a Rutgers University exhibition site, \"... the first significant art historical attention paid to shaped canvases occurred in the 1960s...\"\n\nPeter Laszlo Peri created polychromatic “cut-out” paintings as part of the Constructivist movement between 1921 and 1924. These works which anticipate “shaped canvas” created after 1945 were exhibited widely in the 1920s, notably in two joint exhibitions with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy at Der Sturm Gallery, Berlin, 1922 and 1923, and at the International Exhibition of Modern Art assembled by Societe Anonyme Brooklyn Museum, New York, 1926.\nAbraham Joel Tobias made \"shaped canvases\" in the 1930s. Uruguayan artist Rhod Rothfuss began to experience with \"marco irregular\" paintings in 1942, late in 1944 publish in Arturo magazine your seminal text \"El marco: un problema de la plástica actual\" Munich-born painter Rupprecht Geiger exhibited \"shaped canvases\" in 1948 in Paris, France.\nPaintings exhibited by the New Orleans born abstract painter Edward Clark shown at New York's Brata Gallery in 1957 have also been termed shaped canvas paintings.\n\nBetween the late 1950s through the mid-1960s Jasper Johns experimented with shaped and compartmentalized canvases, notably with his 'Three Flags' painting – one canvas placed on top of another, larger canvas. Robert Rauschenberg's experimental assemblages and \"combines\" of the 1950s also explored variations of divided and shaped canvas. Argentine artist Lucio Fontana also began early on the experiment in shaped and compartmentalized canvases with his Concetto Spaziale, Attese series in 1959. Assigning a date to the origin of the postwar shaped canvas painting may not be possible, but certainly it had emerged by the late 1950s.\n\nFrances Colpitt (\"The Shape of Painting in the 1960s\"; \"Art Journal\", Spring 1991) states flatly that \"the shaped canvas was the dominant form of abstract painting in the 1960s\". She writes that the shaped canvas, \"although frequently described as a hybrid of painting and sculpture, grew out of the issues of abstract painting and was evidence of the desire of painters to move into real space by rejecting behind-the-frame illusionism.\" .\n\nFrank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, Barnett Newman, Charles Hinman Ronald Davis, Richard Tuttle, Leo Valledor, Neil Williams, John Levee, David Novros, Robert Mangold, Gary Stephan, Paul Mogenson, Clark Murray, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the shaped canvas during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Geometric abstract artists, minimalists, and hard-edge painters may, for example, elect to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. There is a connection here with post-painterly abstraction, which reacts against the abstract expressionists' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as their solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting.\nWhile the shaped canvas first challenged the formalized rectangular shape of paintings, it soon questioned the constraints of two-dimensionality. According to Donald Judd in his \"Complete Writings\": 'The main thing wrong with painting is that it is a rectangular plane placed flat against the wall. A rectangle is a shape itself: it is obviously the whole shape; it determines and limits the arrangement of whatever is on or in it\". In 1964, the Solomun R. Guggenheim Museum organised the definitive exhibition 'The Shaped Canvas\" curated by Lawrence Alloway. Lucy Lippard noted that this show focused exclusively on paintings with a \"one -sided continuous surface\" In 1965, Frank Stella and Frank Geldzahler confronted this definition of the shaped canvas by introducing three-dimensional shaped canvases by artists Charles Hinman and Will Insley in their seminal group show \"Shape and Structure\" at Tibor de Naguy in New York. The invasion of the third dimension by paintings was an important development of the shaped canvas as it questioned the frontier between painting and sculpture.\n\nThe apertured, superimposed, multiple canvases of Jane Frank in the 1960s and 1970s are a special case: while generally flat and rectangular, they are rendered sculptural by the presence of large, irregularly shaped holes in the forward canvas or canvases, through which one or more additional painted canvases can be seen. A student of Hans Hofmann, and sharing his concern for pictorial depth as well as his reverence for nature, she also favors colors, textures, and shapes that are complex, nuanced, and organic or earthen – giving her work a brooding or introspective quality that further sets it apart from that of many other shaped-canvas painters.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Trevor Bell, a leading member of the British St. Ives group introduced dynamic shaped-canvas paintings that combined radical, angular structures with an abstract expressionist sensibility. These works continued to evolve into the 1970s as Bell's works were exhibited in the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC and The Tate Gallery in London. The artist’s highly chromatic, color field surfaces on massive canvases merged shaped painting and the subsequent blank space surrounding the object into a state of equal importance. The Italian artist Luigi Malice also experimented with shaped canvases in the late 1960s.\n\nPop artists such as Tom Wesselmann, Jim Dine, and James Rosenquist also took up the shaped canvas medium. Robin Landa writes that \"Wesselmann uses the shape of the container [by which Landa means the canvas] to express the organic quality of smoke\" in his \"smoker\" paintings. According to Colpitt, however, the use of the shaped canvas by 1960s pop artists was considered at the time to be something other than shaped canvas painting properly speaking: \"At the same time, not all reliefs qualified as shaped canvases, which, as an ideological pursuit in the sixties, tended to exclude Pop art.\" (op. cit., p. 52)\n\nAmong shaped-canvas artists of more recent generations, Elizabeth Murray (1940–2007) produced playfully \"exploding\" canvases, in which exuberance of shape and color seems to force itself outside the normative rectangle – or, as a 1981 \"New York Times\" review put it: \"...the inner shapes blast off from their moorings and cause the whole painting to fly apart.\" \n\nSingapore's Anthony Poon (1945–2006) continued the tradition of cool, abstract, minimalist geometry associated with the shaped canvas in the 1960s. The analytical poise and undulating repetitions in his work somewhat recall the work of modular constructivist sculptors such as Erwin Hauer and Norman Carlberg.\n\nThe Filipino artist Pacita Abad (1946–2004) stuffed and stitched her painted canvases for a three-dimensional effect, combining this technique (which she called \"trapunto\", after a kind of quilting technique) with free-wheeling mixed media effects, riotous color, and abstract patterning suggestive of festive homemade textiles, or of party trappings such as streamers, balloons, or confetti. The total effect is joyously extrovert and warm – quite opposed to both the minimalist and pop art versions of \"cool\".\n\nIn reference to the shaped paintings of Jack Reilly (born 1950), Robin Landa emphasizes the power of the shaped canvas to create a sensation of movement: \"Many contemporary artists feel that the arena of painting can be greatly extended by the use of shaped canvases. Movement is established in the container (canvas) itself as well as in the internal space of the container.\" A 1981 review in \"Artweek\" stated \"These intricately constructed pieces are related to wall sculpture, bridging the gap between painting and sculpture, they have an illusionary sculptural presence.\" An additional function of the shaped canvas in Reilly's earlier work was to emphasize the ambiguity of pictorial space in abstract art.\n\nThe Argentine artist Ladislao Pablo Győri (born 1963) became interested in non-representative and rigorous geometry formulations in the 1990s. The study of the paintings of the aforementioned Rhod Rothfuss led him to work in the realization of Madí Turning Paintings-Relief (irregular frame) and 3D digital animations of those geometric structures. Gyula Kosice (sculptor, poet, theorist, and one of the founders of the Argentine avant-garde of the 1940s) wrote: \"He has rationally computerized the primordial ideas of Madi Art... I am convinced that his works radiate an undeniable quality and originality.\"\n\nArtists have often departed from the norm, especially in circumstances requiring special commissions, an example being the paintings Henri Matisse created for Albert C. Barnes and for Nelson Rockefeller.\n\nIn certain instances shaped canvas paintings can be seen as painting in relationship to sculpture and to wall relief. During the early to mid-1960s many young painters born in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s made the transition from painting flat rectangles to painting shaped canvases; some of those artists decided to make sculpture and some artists like Kenneth Noland, Frank Stella, and Ellsworth Kelly did both. Other materials can be used in place of canvas. More viable materials might obviate some of the drawbacks of shaped canvas.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2182999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182999", "title": "Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)", "text": "Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)\n\nDivine Service is the term used in the Eastern Orthodox Church to describe the daily cycle of public services celebrated in the temple (church building).\n\nThe word may be used also of the Divine Liturgy, though its normal connotation is the Daily Office. For Orthodox Christians, the serving of God in divine worship is an obligation of every Christian. This obligation involves both private and public worship. \n\nIn Orthodox theology, the first divine service was offered by Adam and Eve together in the Garden of Eden. In Paradise, divine worship consisted of freely glorifying God, which came naturally to them as a result of their unimpeded \"theoria\" (vision of God in his Divine Energies). After the Fall of man, this theoria became clouded, and worship required effort on the part of man. Now divine service was accomplished in the form of sacrificial offerings, penance and prayer. These sacrifices were later codified in the Law of Moses. Thence forward, only specific offerings were made, by specific persons (priests), in a specific manner, and at a specific place (eventually, the Temple in Jerusalem), and specific liturgical days and feasts were instituted. In Orthodox theology, any efficacy in these Old Testament sacrifices is dependent upon the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.\n\nAfter the Resurrection of Jesus and Pentecost, the Early Church originally continued to participate in the rites of the Jewish Temple (; ; , etc.), in addition to their own celebrations of the Eucharist and agape feasts. But after the Second Destruction of the Temple by the Romans in 70 AD, Christians began to develop their own distinct forms of worship. They did retain, however, some elements of Old Testament worship (chanting of the Psalms, use of incense, etc.) and the setting aside of specific times of the day for worship (; ). \n\nThese periods of prayer eventually developed into seven distinct services, held (a) during the three major periods of the day (evening, morning, and noonday) and (b) during the night watches.\n\nThe daily cycle begins with vespers and proceeds throughout the night and day according to the following table:\n\nThe typica is used whenever the divine liturgy is not celebrated at its usual time, \"i.e.\", when there is a vesperal liturgy or no liturgy at all. On days when the liturgy may be celebrated at its usual hour, the typica follows the sixth hour (or matins, where the custom is to serve the Liturgy then) and the Epistle and Gospel readings for the day are read therein; otherwise, on aliturgical days or when the Liturgy is served at vespers, the Typica has a much shorter form and is served between the ninth hour and vespers.\n\nAlso, there are Inter-Hours for the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours. These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the lenten alleluia replaces \"God is the Lord\" at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the ecclesiarch when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.\n\nIn addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, canons) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the Eucharist.\n\nThe full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other Katholika (sobors). In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the Prothesis ( Liturgy of Preparation); otherwise, the Prothesis is served during matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the Liturgy of the Catechumens commencing straightway after the troparion following the Great Doxology.\n\nThe Midnight Office is seldom served in parishes churches except at the Paschal Vigil as the essential office wherein the burial shroud is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.\n\nThe sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday.\n\nThe Divine Liturgy is not technically a part of the daily cycle of services, since theologically, the celebration of the Eucharist takes place in eternity. It is also not served daily in most parishes and smaller monasteries. However, when it is served, it is usually scheduled into the noonday aggregate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2183007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183007", "title": "Startle response", "text": "Startle response\n\nIn animals, including humans, the startle response is a largely unconscious defensive response to sudden or threatening stimuli, such as sudden noise or sharp movement, and is associated with negative affect. Usually the onset of the startle response is a startle reflex reaction. The startle reflex is a brainstem reflectory reaction (reflex) that serves to protect vulnerable parts, such as the back of the neck (whole-body startle) and the eyes (eyeblink) and facilitates escape from sudden stimuli. It is found across the lifespan of many species. A variety of responses may occur because of individual's emotional state,\nbody posture,\npreparation for execution of a motor task,\nor other activities. The startle response is implicated in the formation of specific phobias.\n\nA startle reflex can occur in the body through a combination of actions. A reflex from hearing a sudden loud noise will happen in the primary acoustic startle reflex pathway consisting of three main central synapses, or signals that travel through the brain.\n\nFirst, there is a synapse from the auditory nerve fibers in the ear to the cochlear root neurons (CRN). These are the first acoustic neurons of the central nervous system. Studies have shown a direct correlation to the amount of decrease of the startle to the number of CRNs that were killed. Second, there is a synapse from the CRN axons to the cells in the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis (PnC) of the brain. These are neurons that are located in the pons of the brainstem. A study done to disrupt this portion of the pathway by the injection of PnC inhibitory chemicals has shown a dramatic decrease in the amount of startle by about 80 to 90 percent. Third, a synapse occurs from the PnC axons to the motor neurons in the facial motor nucleus or the spinal cord that will directly or indirectly control the movement of muscles. The activation of the facial motor nucleus causes a jerk of the head while an activation in the spinal cord causes the whole body to startle.\n\nDuring neuromotor examinations of newborns, it is noted that, for a number of techniques, the patterns of the startle reaction and the Moro reflex may significantly overlap, the notable distinction being the absence of arm abduction (spreading) during startle responses.\n\nThere are many various reflexes that can occur simultaneously during a startle response. The fastest reflex recorded in humans happens within the masseter muscle or jaw muscle. The reflex was measured by electromyography which records the electrical activity during movement of the muscles. This also showed the latency response or the delay between the stimulus and the response recorded was found to be about 14 milliseconds. The blink of the eye which is the reflex of the orbicularis oculi muscle was found to have a latency of about 20 to 40 milliseconds. Out of larger body parts, the head is quickest in a movement latency in a range from 60 to 120 milliseconds. The neck then moves almost simultaneously with a latency of 75 to 121 milliseconds. Next, the shoulder jerks at 100 to 121 milliseconds along with the arms at 125 to 195 milliseconds. Lastly the legs responds with a latency of 145 to 395 milliseconds. This type of cascading response correlates to how the synapses travel from the brain and down the spinal cord to activate each motor neuron.\n\nThe acoustic startle reflex is thought to be caused by an auditory stimulus greater than 80 decibels. The reflex is typically measured by electromyography, brain imaging or sometimes positron electron tomography There are many brain structures and pathways thought to be involved in the reflex. The amygdala, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and anterior cingulate cortex are all thought to play a role in modulating the reflex. The anterior cingulate cortex in the brain is largely thought to be the main area associated with emotional response and awareness, which can contribute to the way an individual reacts to startle inducing stimuli. Along with the anterior cingulate cortex, the amygdala and the hippocampus are known to have implications in this reflex. The amygdala is known to have a role in the \"fight-or-flight response\", and the hippocampus functions to form memories of the stimulus and the emotions associated with it. The role of the BNST in the acoustic startle reflex may be attributed to specific areas within the nucleus responsible for stress and anxiety responses. Activation of the BNST by certain hormones is thought to promote a startle response The auditory pathway for this response was largely elucidated in rats in the 1980s. The basic pathway follows the auditory pathway from the ear up to the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (LLN) from where it activates a motor centre in the reticular formation. This centre sends descending projections to lower motor neurones of the limbs.\n\nIn slightly more detail this corresponds to ear (cochlea) → cranial nerve VIII (auditory) → cochlear nucleus (ventral/inferior) → LLN → caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC). The whole process has a less than 10ms latency. There is no involvement of the superior/rostral or inferior/caudal colliculus in the reaction that \"twitches\" the hindlimbs, but these may be important for adjustment of pinnae and gaze towards the direction of the sound, or for the associated blink.\n\nIn a 2005 study by Martina et al., at the Department of Aviation and Logistics, University of Southern Queensland, the performance of aircraft pilots following unexpected critical events, in relation to recent aircraft accidents, is examined. The deleterious effects of the startle response was identified as causal or contributory in these events. The authors argue that fear resulting from threat\npotentiates startle effects and has significant deleterious effects on cognition. This could contribute to poor performance following an unexpected critical event in aviation. They discuss training strategies for improved performance, which would expose pilots to unexpected critical events more often, and develop greater self-efficacy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2183011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183011", "title": "Ellen and William Craft", "text": "Ellen and William Craft\n\nEllen Craft (1826–1891) and William Craft (September 25, 1824 – January 29, 1900) were slaves from Macon, Georgia, in the United States, who escaped to the North in December 1848 by traveling openly by train and steamboat, arriving in Philadelphia on Christmas Day. She passed as a white male planter and he as her personal servant. Their daring escape was widely publicized, making them among the most famous of fugitive slaves. Abolitionists featured them in public lectures to gain support in the struggle to end the institution.\n\nAs the light-skinned quadroon daughter of a mulatto slave and her white master, Ellen Craft used her appearance to pass as a white man, dressed in male clothing, during their escape.\n\nAs prominent fugitives, they were threatened by slave catchers in Boston after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, so the Crafts emigrated to England. They lived there for nearly two decades and raised five children. The Crafts lectured publicly about their escape. In 1860 they published a written account, \"Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom; Or, The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery\". One of the most compelling of the many slave narratives published before the American Civil War, their book reached wide audiences in Great Britain and the United States. After their return to the US in 1868, the Crafts opened an agricultural school for freedmen's children in Georgia. They worked at the school and its farm until 1890. Their account was reprinted in the United States in 1999, with both the Crafts credited as authors, and it is available online at Project Gutenberg and the University of Virginia.\n\nEllen Craft was born in 1826 in Clinton, Georgia, to Maria, a mixed-race slave, and her wealthy planter master, Major James Smith. At least three-quarters European by ancestry, Ellen was very fair-skinned and resembled her white half-siblings, who were her master's legitimate children. Smith's wife gave the 11-year-old slave Ellen as a wedding gift to her daughter Eliza Cromwell Smith to get the girl out of the household and remove the evidence of her husband's infidelity.\n\nAfter Eliza Smith married Dr. Robert Collins, she took Ellen with her to live in the city of Macon where they made their home. Ellen grew up as a house servant to Eliza, which gave her privileged access to information about the area.\n\nWilliam was born in Macon, where he met his future wife at the age of 16 when his first master sold him to settle gambling debts. Before he was sold, William witnessed his 14-year-old sister and each of his parents being separated by sales to different owners. William's new master apprenticed him as a carpenter and allowed him to work for fees, taking most of his earnings.\n\nAt the age of 20, Ellen married William Craft, in whom her master Collins held a half interest. Craft saved money from being hired out in town as a carpenter. Not wanting to rear a family in slavery, during the Christmas season of 1848 the couple planned an escape.\n\nEventually they had five children together, who were mostly born and reared during their nearly two decades living in England. The Crafts went there after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, because, as a prominent fugitive slave couple, they were in danger of being captured in Boston by bounty hunters. Their children were Charles Estlin Phillips (1852–1938), William Ivens (1855–1926), Brougham H. (1857–1920), Ellen A. Craft (1863–1917), and Alfred G. (1871–1939), all born in England. When the Crafts returned to the United States after the American Civil War, three of their children came with them.\nEllen planned to take advantage of her appearance to pass as white while the pair traveled by train and boat to the North; she dressed as a man since at the time it was not customary for a white woman to travel alone, let alone with a slave. She also pretended illness to limit conversation, for she was uneducated. William was to act as her slave and personal servant. During that time period, domestic slaves frequently accompanied their masters during travel, so the Crafts did not expect to be questioned. To their surprise, they were detained but only temporarily. An officer had demanded proof that William was indeed Ellen's property. They were finally let on the train due to sympathy from passengers and the bus conductor. Their escape is known as the most ingenious plot in fugitive slave history, even more ingenious than \"Henry Box Brown\".\n\nDuring their escape, they traveled on first-class trains, stayed in the best hotels, and Ellen dined one evening with a steamboat captain. Ellen cut her hair and bought appropriate clothes to pass as a young man, traveling in a jacket and trousers. William used his earnings as a cabinet-maker to buy clothes for Ellen to appear as a white slaveholder. They carefully selected clothes that white male slaveholders would wear. Ellen's wardrobe included a top hat, cravat, jacket, tartan, and a tassel, all of which signified slaveholder status. William fixed her hair to add to her manly appearance. Ellen also practiced the correct gestures and behavior. She wore her right arm in a sling to hide the fact that she did not know how to write. They traveled to nearby Macon for a train to Savannah. Although the Crafts had several close calls along the way and neither could read nor write, they were successful in evading detection. On December 21, they boarded a steamship for Philadelphia, in the free state of Pennsylvania, where they arrived early on the morning of Christmas Day.\n\nTheir innovation was in escaping as a pair. Historians have noted other slave women who posed as men to escape, such as Clarissa Davis of Virginia, who dressed as a man and took a New England-bound ship to freedom; Mary Millburn, who also sailed as a male passenger; and Maria Weems from the District of Columbia. As a young woman of fifteen, she dressed as a man and escaped.\n\nSoon after the Crafts' arrival in the North, abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and William Wells Brown encouraged them to recount their escape in public lectures to abolitionist circles of New England. They moved to the well-established free black community on the north side of Beacon Hill in Boston, where they were married in a Christian ceremony. Ellen Craft posed in her escape clothes for a photograph (the basis for the engraving included with this article). It was widely distributed by abolitionists as part of their campaign against slavery. Like her actions, her image as a man challenged viewers' assumptions about the \"fixity of gender, race, normalcy, and class.\"\n\nDuring the next two years, the Crafts made numerous public appearances to recount their escape and speak against slavery. Because society generally disapproved at the time of women speaking to public audiences of mixed gender, Ellen typically stood on the stage while William told their story. An article of April 27, 1849, in the abolitionist paper \"The Liberator\", however, reported her speaking to an audience of 800–900 people in Newburyport, Massachusetts. Audiences were intensely curious about the young woman who had been so bold in the escape. In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which increased penalties for aiding fugitive slaves and required residents and law enforcement of free states to cooperate in capturing and returning such slaves to their owners. The act provided for a reward to officers and simplified the process by which people might be certified as slaves, requiring little documentation from slave catchers. Commissioners appointed to hear such cases were paid more for ruling that a person was a slave than not.\n\nA month after the new law was effective, Collins sent two bounty hunters to Boston to retrieve the Crafts. Willis H. Hughes and John Knight eagerly traveled north from Macon intending to capture William and Ellen Craft; upon arriving to Boston they were met with resistance by both white and black Bostonians. Abolitionists in Boston had formed the biracial Boston Vigilance Committee to resist the new Slave Bill; its members protected the Crafts by moving them around various \"safe houses\" (such as the Tappan-Philbrick house in the nearby town of Brookline) until they could leave the country. The two bounty hunters finally gave up and returned to the south. Collins even appealed to the President of the United States, Millard Fillmore, asking him to intervene so he could regain his property. The President agreed that the Crafts should be returned to their owners in the South, and authorized the use of military force if necessary to take them.\n\nThe Crafts and many other fugitive slaves were no longer safe in the North. That year the couple moved to Liverpool, England, a major port.\n\nBounty hunters and slave catchers sought fees for finding fugitive slaves. William Craft described the new law as \"an enactment too infamous to have been thought of or tolerated by any people in the world except the unprincipled and tyrannical Yankees\". Aided by their supporters, the Crafts decided to escape to England. They traveled from Portland, Maine overland to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they boarded the \"Cambria\", bound for Liverpool. As William later recounted in their memoir, \"It was not until we stepped ashore at Liverpool that we were free from every slavish fear\". They were aided in England by a group of prominent abolitionists, including Harriet Martineau. She arranged for their intensive schooling at the village school in Ockham, Surrey.\n\nHaving learned to read and write, in 1852, Ellen Craft published the following, which was widely circulated in the antislavery press in both Great Britain and the US. The anti-abolition press had suggested the Crafts regretted their flight to England. She said:\n\nSo I write these few lines merely to say that the statement is entirely unfounded, for I have never had the slightest inclination whatever of returning to bondage; and God forbid that I should ever be so false to liberty as to prefer slavery in its stead. In fact, since my escape from slavery, I have gotten much better in every respect than I could have possibly anticipated. Though, had it been to the contrary, my feelings in regard to this would have been just the same, for I had much rather starve in England, a free woman, than be a slave for the best man that ever breathed upon the American continent.\n\nThe Crafts spent 19 years in England, where they had five children together. Ellen participated in reform organizations such as the London Emancipation Committee, the Women's Suffrage Organization, and the British and Foreign Freedmen's Society. They earned speaking fees by public lectures about slavery in the US and their escape. William Craft set up a business again, but they still struggled financially. For most of their time in England, the Craft family lived in Hammersmith. After the end of the Civil War and emancipation of slaves, Ellen located her mother Maria in Georgia; she paid for her passage to England, so they were reunited.\n\nIn 1868, after the American Civil War and passage of constitutional amendments granting emancipation, citizenship and rights to freedmen, the Crafts returned with three of their children to the United States. They raised funds from supporters, and in 1870 they bought 1800 acres of land in Georgia near Savannah in Bryan County. There they founded the Woodville Co-operative Farm School in 1873 for the education and employment of freedmen. In 1876, William Craft was charged with misuse of funds, and he lost a libel case in 1878 in which he tried to clear his name. The school closed soon after. Although the Crafts tried to keep the farm running, dropping cotton prices and post-Reconstruction era violence contributed to its failure. Whites discriminated against freedmen while working to re-establish white supremacy in politics and economics. By 1876, white Democrats regained control of the state governments in the South.\n\nIn 1890, the Crafts moved to Charleston, South Carolina to live with their daughter Ellen, who was married to Dr. William D. Crum. He was appointed Collector of the Port of Charleston by President Theodore Roosevelt. The elder Ellen Craft died in 1891, and her widower William January 29, 1900.\n\nTheir book provides a unique view of race, gender, and class in the 19th century. It offers examples of racial passing, cross-dressing, and middle-class \"performance\" in a society in which each of these boundaries was thought to be distinct and stable. While originally published with only William's name as author, twentieth-century and more recent scholarship has re-evaluated Ellen's likely contribution, noting the inclusion of material about Sally Miller and other women slaves. Reprints since the 1990s have listed both the Crafts as authors.\n\nTheir escape, and particularly Ellen's disguise, which played on so many layers of appearance and identity, showed the interlocking nature of race, gender, and class. Ellen had to \"perform\" successfully in all three arenas simultaneously for the couple to travel undetected. Since only William's narrative voice tells their joint story in the book, critics say it is suggestive of how difficult it was for a black woman to find a public voice, although she was bold in action. Brusky says that, in the way that she used wrappings to \"muffle\" her during the escape to avoid conversation, Ellen in the book is presented through the filter of William's perspective.\n\nHistorians and readers cannot evaluate how much Ellen contributed to the recounting of their story, but audiences appreciated seeing the young woman who had been so daring. On one occasion, a newspaper notes, there was \"considerable disappointment\" when Ellen Craft was absent. Since they appeared over a period of 10 years, as William recounted their escape, they could respond to audiences' reactions to Ellen in person and to hearing of her actions. It is likely their published account reflects her influence.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This scandal arose from corruption in the Office of the Collector of the Port of New York.\n\nIn 1829, President Andrew Jackson appointed Samuel Swartwout to serve as Collector of the Port of New York. Nine years later, Swartwout left office at the expiration of his term in 1838, retaining $201,096.40 with which to pay any pending claims that might be brought against him. He then went to England to raise money on his coal property before ensuring that his account at the customhouse was closed. After he left the country, or perhaps before, his account was \"adjusted\" by a subordinate and possibly by his successor, through the instigation of President Martin Van Buren. It was then alleged that Swartwout had embezzled $1,225,705.09 (over $30 million in today's dollars) and fled. One of his assistants was indicted in 1841 for embezzling $609,525.71 of the sum, and, according to Swartwout's trustee, a federal court further reduced the amount by $435,052.21, leaving the remaining amount which Swartwout claimed he owed. Swartwout forfeited his personal property to meet the deficit and returned to the United States in 1841 after federal officials assured him that they would not prosecute him.\n\nPresident Martin Van Buren then appointed Jesse Hoyt to replace Swartwout and to take corrective measures to prevent any future problems in the Collector's office. However, in 1841, allegations began to circulate that Hoyt had also been embezzling, and Hoyt was removed by Van Buren on February 27.\n\nThere was also something of a \"scandal with the scandal.\" President John Tyler appointed a special three-person committee, headed by Senator George Poindexter of Mississippi, to investigate the allegations of fraud and embezzlement in the Collector's Office. The committee's report found overwhelming evidence of massive corruption. However, President Tyler had made the political mistake of failing to secure the approval of Congress for the creation of the Poindexter committee; the Congress, miffed at what it viewed as an usurpation of its powers, repudiated President Tyler's action in creating the commission.\n\nIt is believed that Swartwout's story is the origin of the term \"Swartwouted out\", which has since come to define the embezzlement of a large sum of money from the United States government and subsequent escape to a foreign nation to escape punishment.\n\n"}

Yuen later realises that \"wait for me\" corresponds to a phone number of a bank in Istanbul.\nIn Istanbul, Yuen uses the crucifix, which turns out to be a stamp, to retrieve the contents of Park's safety deposit box. Shortly after leaving the bank, he encounters several robbers trying to steal his briefcase full of money. He holds off the robbers until the police show up and the robbers flee. While touring Istanbul, Yuen meets a mysterious Chinese woman, Yong, who has \"wait for me\" embroidered on her scarf. When Yuen asks her where she got her scarf, she arranges to meet him at a later date and time.\n\nWhen Yuen is at a Turkish bath, he gets accosted by a group of thugs demanding that he hands over \"the thing\". After a long chase through the streets, Yuen finally escapes from them but shows up late for his meeting with Yong. Just then, Carmen and her colleague, Philip, approach Yuen and reveal to him that they are actually CIA agents. The \"thing\" that everyone is after is a biological weapon, Anthrax II, a more powerful version of anthrax. The weapon had already killed many people in Anatolia, which was chosen as a testing ground. Park developed brain cancer as a result of his involvement in the case. Yuen also learns that Zen, a crime lord, wants to buy the Anthrax II and had sent Yong to get close to Yuen to gather information.\n\nYuen meets up with Yong, who confirms she is working for Zen. Moments later, they are captured by a group of thugs and brought back to the Anatolian village. As the thugs are beating up Yuen to force him to tell them where the Anthrax II is, mercenaries attack the village and gun down all the thugs. In the ensuing chaos, Yuen escapes with Yong on a makeshift raft. They are picked up by Zen, who reveals that he sent the mercenaries to save them. Yuen also learns that Yong is a drug addict enslaved by Zen. Zen offers Yuen a new deal: more money and Yong's freedom in exchange for the Anthrax II. Although Yuen refuses, Zen still gives him time to find the Anthrax II.\n\nYuen recalls that there was a Bible in the safety deposit box so he makes his way to a nearby church and meets a priest who knows Park. The priest leads Yuen to the basement where Park temporarily stayed; Yuen finds two vials of Anthrax II there and a note saying \"game over\". Yuen then reluctantly hands over the Anthrax II to Zen in exchange for Yong. It turns out later that Zen had double-crossed Yuen by giving Yong a fatal dose of drugs. After Yong dies at the train station, Yuen gets arrested and thrown into prison but Carmen and Ashley bail him out. Carmen, feeling sorry for Yong's death, secretly reveals to Yuen that the CIA is meeting Zen the next day to discuss buying the Anthrax II from him.\n\nYuen takes matters into his own hands and tries to stop Zen at the airport. While Zen and his henchmen flee in a car, Yuen chases them, fights them and manages to get back the Anthrax II. However, the car gets stuck to the rear of a tanker, which soon catches fire. The tanker has to keep moving at a certain speed or else it will explode. After Yuen manages to save the driver and his son, the tanker is heading straight towards the edge of a disused bridge. Just then, Manny Liu appears in a helicopter and tries to pull Yuen out but fails. Yuen leaps from the tanker and grabs hold of the plastic bridge barrier as he swings down. He rolls down a slope, sustains severe injuries from the fall, and becomes unconscious. Liu searches Yuen for the Anthrax II, finds it and leaves.\n\nWhen Yuen regains consciousness in hospital later, he learns from Liu that his entire adventure was actually a CIA mission arranged to be performed by him as an informal, non-official agent (an \"accidental spy\"). He was chosen because of his background as an orphan, his sharp intuition and excellent fighting skills. The dream of his parents is actually an illusion created by Liu, who added drugs into Yuen's drink to put him into a hypnotic state.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Yuen, now officially a spy, delivers a briefcase to a drug dealer in Italy and tips off the police to arrest him.\n\n\nThe film grossed HK$30,009,076 during its theatrical run in Hong Kong, and was Hong Kong's third biggest domestic release of the year.\n\n\"The Accidental Spy\" holds a 29% \"rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 7 reviews.\n\nDimension Films (then a sub-set of Miramax, which was owned by The Walt Disney Company) acquired the international distribution rights to the film outside of Asia. Like many Jackie Chan films distributed by Disney, scenes were cut, foreign dialogue was dubbed, and the music score was changed.\n\nThe film was first released on DVD by Universe Laser in Hong Kong. The release contains a non-anamorphic picture and a \"making of\" feature section. On 19 March 2009, Kam & Ronson released a remastered DVD with an anamorphic picture, 5.1 and DTS sound, but with no special features.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray Disc on 4 May 2009. This film is the first Hong Kong production by Jackie Chan to be released on Blu-ray Disc.\n\nThe scene of Buck's disguising while escaping from thugs was reproduced in Bollywood movie \"Thank You\" (2011), wherein Akshay Kumar's character, detective Kishan, also hides by twisting hanging materials around himself.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2183033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183033", "title": "Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885", "text": "Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885\n\nThe Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 (48 & 49 Vict. c.69), or \"An Act to make further provision for the Protection of Women and Girls, the suppression of brothels, and other purposes\", was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the latest in a 25-year series of legislation in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland beginning with the Offences against the Person Act 1861 that raised the age of consent and delineated the penalties for sexual offences against women and minors. It also strengthened existing legislation against prostitution and homosexuality. This act was also notable for the circumstances of its passage in Parliament.\n\nUnder the Offences against the Person Act 1861, the age of consent was 12 (reflecting the common law), it was a felony to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 10, and it was a misdemeanour to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl between the ages of 10 and 12. In addition, the 1861 Act had made the penalty for indecent assault or attempted rape of a girl below the consensual age two years' imprisonment. Although the age of consent was subsequently raised to 13 upon amendments made to the 1861 act in 1875, these pieces of legislation were enacted to protect mainly the very young and the very wealthy. The reason for the latter was that the lawmakers at that time were concerned about the welfare of heiresses, meaning their own daughters and, by extension, those of their friends and patrons; this is why they imposed the most severe penalties on those who would seduce or abduct women without their parents' consent even though the perpetrator intended to marry his quarry. Girls over the age of 13 and the poor had little protection under this law.\n\nThis double standard extended to prostitution. While it was tolerated in the middle-class, concern about the spread of venereal disease, specifically syphilis, persuaded Parliament to pass a series of Contagious Diseases Acts in an effort to contain the disease. The law permitted the police to arrest suspected prostitutes to be submitted for examination for venereal disease. Its unintended consequence was that any woman who happened to look like a prostitute would be subject to this law. Men, however, were not subjected even though they were equally responsible for spreading the disease. These acts were later repealed due to public pressure over the double-standard nature of these laws.\n\nPublic opinion at the time was thus in favour of stricter legislation and harsher penalties for sexual offenders, and better treatment for women and children. Social purity groups like the Society for the Suppression of Vice and feminists led by Josephine Butler focused on the evils of child prostitution as the chief factor in the sexual exploitation of the young. In addition, during the 1860s and 1870s, child advocacy groups were concerned with child abuse and other forms of maltreatment. Furthermore, groups like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (SPCC) were concerned about the limitation of the testimony of young children. They investigated, reported and brought to court accusations of child abuse and neglect. It was in this socio-political climate that legislation to change this was introduced in 1881.\n\nThe bill for the amendment of the law took four years to bring to completion. It began when Benjamin Scott, the anti-vice campaigner and Chamberlain of the City of London, approached Lord Granville to enact legislation for the protection of young girls from transportation to the Continent for \"immoral purposes\". In response, the House of Lords formed a Select committee to investigate and confirmed an increase in child prostitution and white slavery. The committee's report made nine recommendations which became the basis for the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, including raising the age of consent to sixteen years as well as increased penalties for sexual offences.\n\nThe bill passed easily in the House of Lords in 1883, but was dropped in the House of Commons. It was reintroduced in 1884 but was again dropped during the struggle over parliamentary reform. In April 1885, the Earl of Dalhousie tempted fate by reintroducing the bill a third time. While the bill passed smoothly through the Lords in May—albeit with some revisions, most notably lowering the age of consent to fifteen—it again faced an uphill battle in the Commons, who were preparing to disband for the Whit Week bank holiday on 22 May 1885 and thus rather indifferent to the bill. In addition, many Members of Parliament were opposed to the measure, citing the curtailment of civil liberties through its increase of police powers.\n\nDespite the effort of the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt, to move for a second reading of the Bill, no vote was taken on the measure by the time Parliament was adjourned on 22 May 1885. Supporters of the bill by that time feared that it would again be put aside and decided to take drastic action.\n\nThese fears apparently became real when Gladstone's government resigned over the budget. A minority caretaker government was formed under Lord Salisbury pending the holding of the general election later that year. As a result, it was deemed that no time-consuming or controversial measure be undertaken until then.\n\nEven before the government crisis in June 1885, on 23 May, W.T. Stead, the editor of the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" was approached by Benjamin Scott, who called his attention to its being set aside again. Stead, one of those who had been opposed to the Contagious Diseases Acts since the 1870s, was convinced to agitate popular support for protective legislation. His subsequent investigations were published in the \"Gazette\" from 6–10 July 1885 under the title \"The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\". Not only did he base his investigations on interviews with the police, as well as those who were involved in the flesh trade, he went beyond it by setting an example: he \"purchased\" a girl and wrote about it.\n\nWith the assistance of Bramwell Booth of the Salvation Army, Stead bought 13-year-old Eliza Armstrong from her parents, who lived in the Lisson Grove area of west London, and went through the procedure of preparing her for export. She was examined to prove that she was still a virgin, then she was brought to a brothel and lightly drugged to wait for Stead, her purchaser. He entered Eliza's room and, having regarded this as confirmation that he had his way, withdrew to write his story. Eliza was turned over to the care of the Salvation Army.\n\nThe revelations caused an uproar. Copies of the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" were snapped up, often fetching premium prices. While many denounced Stead's exposé, it did what it was intended to do: it prompted Parliament to resume the debate over the Criminal Law Amendment Bill on 9 July 1885.\n\nThe SPCC, which celebrated its first anniversary on 13 July 1885, took advantage of the resumption of the debate to make its own recommendations to the bill, including the raising of the age of consent to 18 years and more severe measures to protect children from exploitation. These proposals were introduced through their representatives in Parliament. However, many members of Parliament, already infuriated by Stead's tactics, sought to obstruct any alterations to the laws.\n\nIn addition to the recommendations made by the SPCC, on 31 July 1885 Liverpool representative Samuel Smith presented to the Commons a clause to abolish the oath for child victims for sexual assault. However, longtime opponents of the bill fought against it and, despite the best efforts of its supporters, the SPCC's proposal was narrowly defeated 123–120.\n\nOutraged by this defeat, Stead condemned it in the \"Gazette\", listing the names of each member who voted against the clause. Congregationalist minister Benjamin Waugh, the leader of the SPCC, focusing on the fact that the proposal was defeated by only three votes, redoubled his efforts to lobby support. Along the way he managed to bring Henry James, the former Attorney-General, to his side and re-introduce Smith's amendment, which he did on 9 August. The Home Secretary, R.A. Cross, dropped his earlier opposition to the measure after consulting with a colleague as to the provisions of Scottish law on the subject. This was influential when the measure was once again put to a vote, and the SPCC's \"oath clause\" was included in the final version of the bill.\n\nEven before the SPCC's \"oath clause\" was passed, another clause was introduced by MP Henry Labouchere late in the evening of 6 August 1885. Labouchere wanted to expand its reach. The clause provided for a term of imprisonment \"not exceeding two years\", with or without hard labour, for any man found guilty of gross indecency with another male, whether \"in public or in private\". No definition was given of what, exactly, constituted \"gross indecency\", as Victorian morality demurred from giving precise descriptions of activity considered immoral. In practice, \"gross indecency\" was widely interpreted as any male homosexual behaviour short of actual sodomy, which remained a more serious and separate crime.\n\nThe Criminal Law Amendment Act was finally passed on 14 August 1885 and in its final form effectively repealed Sections 49 and 52 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and the whole of the Offences against the Person Act 1875. Its provisions were as follows:\n\nIt also had sections outlining the penalties for abduction and procuring for the purpose of prostitution for girls under the age of eighteen, as well as relaxing the rules on witness testimony: while children under the age of 12 were allowed to testify as proposed by the SPCC, it also gave the right of the accused to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe effect of the law became noticeable almost immediately. While few cases of sexual offences were reported before the passage of the law, the number of reported cases skyrocketed in the months afterwards, especially child molestation cases. It may be that the actual number of cases remained the same, but the fact that more cases were reported and brought to the courts was at the very least a reflection of how the law changed perceptions of how women and children should be treated. While the inclusion of Section 11 criminalised male homosexuality, nevertheless it was connected with notions of male lust, which many felt was the root cause of vice. More than 80 years would pass before decriminalisation would take effect.\n\nThe Act was repealed for England and Wales by section 51 of, and the fourth schedule to, the Sexual Offences Act 1956; and for Scotland by section 21(2) of, and Schedule 2 to, the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 1976.\n\nSections 3(3), 7 and 8 of this Act were repealed for the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.\n\nFollowing the Royal Pardon of Alan Turing, who was convicted of gross indecency under this Act for homosexual acts with another man, the government announced in 2016 its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical offences, through enacting what has been described as an \"Alan Turing law\".\n\n\n"}

He studied law, history of art, and literature at the Jagiellonian University of Kraków, but gave up his studies to join theatre. He moved to Poznań for yet another contract where he was drafted to the Austrian army in 1907. A year later he settled in Łódź where he performed until 1911. He moved to Warsaw in the Russian Partition and worked in \"Teatr Mały\" and \"Teatr Polski\" (1913). He was sent to Moscow by the Russians (1915). Upon his return to sovereign Poland in 1918 he embarked upon an energetic career in emerging national and experimental theatre, with guest performances in over ninety cities and towns until 1928. In 1930 he took over the Ateneum of Warsaw. He managed it until the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland, sharing the responsibilities with Leon Schiller in 1932–33 season.\n\nDuring World War II he was arrested and imprisoned at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Jaracz was released after numerous interventions on 15 May 1941. He died in Otwock, near Warsaw in 1945 due to his ailing health. The repertory Stefan Jaracz Theatre in Łódź, Poland is named after him, and so is the Ateneum Theatre in Warsaw since 1951.\n\nJaracz was endowed with a heavy, angular figure and a hoarse yet highly evocative voice. He earned the fame of the most perfect actor of roles of the disadvantaged and the humiliated. He approached them without sentimentality, conveying bitterness and coarseness as well as rebellion, even if they were deeply hidden. With his acting understated and free from affectation, he was able to create characters who were profoundly human, moving and simple. Jaracz was considered to bring to the theater a somewhat plebeian flavor that added verity to his roles. Sometimes he played bluntly, although over time his acting became more detached and would at times reveal a hint of mockery. Nevertheless he was regarded as an actor who empathized with, respected and defended his protagonists, and who conveyed their suffering. He worked hard on his roles, polishing them and sometimes introducing major changes to stagings in other theaters.\n\n\n\n"}

The airfield is located south of the central business district of Yuma, a city in Yuma County, Arizona, United States and east of San Diego International Airport. It is mostly used for military aviation, but is also served by one commercial airline and one aeromedical Medevac company as well as being used for general aviation activities.\n\nAlthough many U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and International Air Transport Association (IATA), this airport is assigned NYL by the FAA and YUM by the IATA (which has not assigned NYL to any airport). The airport's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier is KNYL.\n\nYuma International Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has four runways:\n\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2017, the airport had 179,838 aircraft operations, an average of 493 per day: 53% military, 38% general aviation and 9% air carrier. At that time there were 171 aircraft based at this airport:\n41% single-engine, 9% multi-engine, 2% jet, no helicopter, 1% ultralight and 47% military.\n\nYuma's history of flight dates to 1911 when Robert Fowler took off from Yuma to set a world's record for endurance and distance. He entered a Transcontinental Air competition sponsored by William Randolph Hearst. Originating in Los Angeles, he arrived in Yuma on October 25. Over 2,000 spectators watched the aircraft circle and make a landing. The next day he succeeded in setting a world's record.\n\nIn 1925, the Yuma Chamber of Commerce went to work to secure an airport for Yuma. After two years of negotiations, of land was secured from the federal government. The land was cleared, leveled, and the first hangar constructed. The of land was officially designated as an active airport and named Fly Field after Colonel Ben Franklin Fly. In the beginning, Fly Field had limitations, including loose sand and a lack of facilities. In 1925, the Chamber's Aviation Committee decided another was needed to create a first-class landing field in Yuma. Intense negotiations resulted in a public/private land trade, along with a promise by the government to provide Fly Field a steel frame hangar capable of housing 12 airplanes. Congressman Douglas of Arizona introduced a bill asking for the lease of of government land to Yuma County for 20 years at a cost of $1 per year, with the privilege of renewal for another 20 years at the same rate. President Calvin Coolidge signed the Yuma Aviation Bill on February 27, 1928. Almost immediately, the aviation committee started lining up activities for the airport. Yuma was selected to be a night stop for three transcontinental air races from New York to Los Angeles, and an international air race from Mexico to Los Angeles. The Chamber agreed to provide free gas and oil to the racers, at an estimated cost of $2,000. Yuma was also selected to be a stop-over for the first All American Tour of 25 Airplanes. In June of that year, the military announced that a United States Meteorological and Aerological station would be constructed at Fly Field at a cost of $30,000 and would be manned by four Army personnel, marking the first military presence at Yuma's airport.\n\nIn 1929, Yuma was selected as the first stop for the Women's Transcontinental Air Race. Amelia Earhart experienced landing problems and nosed her aircraft in the soft sand, destroying her propeller. A new propeller and mechanics were flown in from Los Angeles to make repairs so she could continue in the race. Fly Field experienced a downturn during the depression; but in the late 1930s it became clear that the United States faced a threat of conflict with the German Reich. The War Department needed facilities to train combat pilots and crews. Planning for the Yuma area, including a potential bombing range located between Yuma and Gila Bend, started in 1939 when a group of aeronautical experts toured the area. The Yuma County Board of Supervisors recommended Fly Field as a base for the Army Air Corps. Initially, Yuma County assumed the burden of airfield maintenance and limited the use exclusively to Army and Navy aircraft.\n\nMoney for the Fly Field expansion arrived early in 1941. Three separate government agencies pooled a total of $781,000 to initiate construction. By mid-year another $635,000 became available for re-paving the north-south runway. Between 1941 and 1942 two paved runways, each measuring , were completed under the command of the 403rd Army Air Force Base Unit, Army Air Forces West Coast Training Center. In June 1942, the War Department authorized an additional $3 million. The first class of cadets arrived in January 1943 when the field was used for advanced pilot and gunnery training.\n\nIn September 1946, Yuma Army Air Field was scaled back and declared a surplus. The civilian portion of the field was returned to County, who again referred to it as Fly Field. The Chamber of Commerce promoted the City of Yuma airplane's famous endurance flights, which highlighted the region's weather which was very conducive to flying. This was a topic of particular importance to the military. The Airport became very active as a military facility during the Korean War, and was used extensively by the U.S. Air Force. In early 1951 the County Supervisors received a Department of Defense proposal to lease the airfield as a civilian-operated military training base with specific military and civilian sides. The Yuma County Board of Supervisors gave the U.S. Air Force a right of entry and in 1956 the field was named Vincent Air Force Base.\n\nAt the same time, the United States of America issued a U.S. Government Patent from the Department of the Interior which conveyed specific airport land to Yuma County. The conveyed land was the general footprint within today's current Airport boundary. The patent also preserves the ability of Yuma County to collect and retain landing fees to provide for Airport operating expenses. In addition to the conveyance of land, the patent granted rights to unrestricted civil aviation use of the airfield's facilities, including all runways and taxiways, or as it is worded in the patent:\n\n\"\"There is also granted an easement for public airport purposes in and to the land area and facilities of the Yuma County Airport, granting to the County of Yuma, State of Arizona, its successors in functions or interest and assigns, the right to use for the landing, takeoff, and parking of civil aircraft, in common with aircraft; owned and controlled by the Government, the runways now located on the airport, those taxiways connecting the runways with the lands granted above, such runways as may be located on the airport as now constituted or as 'altered or expanded, and such future taxiways as are necessary for ingress and egress to the future runways…\"\"\n\nIn 1959, control of the base was given to the United States Navy and then, nine days later, to the U.S. Marine Corps. The base was renamed Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (MCAS Yuma) on July 20, 1962. In 1965, the Yuma County Board of Supervisors created the Yuma County Airport Authority in accordance with the provisions of section 10-451, of the Arizona Revised Statutes, to take over the airport and all associated activity. A board of directors was elected from the community to oversee the Airport Authority and all airport functions. In 2007, the board of directors passed a resolution declaring that Yuma International Airport was an \"Aviation Partner\" with MCAS Yuma. That partnership continues today, allows for unrestricted civil aviation use of the airfield facilities, including all runways and taxiways and promotes the security of the United States.\n\nThe airport's FAA location identifier was YUM (ICAO: KYUM) until June 2008, when it was changed to use MCAS Yuma's identifier of NYL (ICAO: KNYL). The IATA airport code, used for passenger travel, remains YUM.\n\nOn April 1, 2011, Southwest Airlines Flight 812 with 118 passengers en route from Phoenix to Sacramento diverted to the airport after a rapid decompression which was the result of a large tear in the plane's fuselage 40 minutes into the flight. The Boeing 737-300 series aircraft made an emergency landing at the airport (one flight attendant suffered minor injuries during the rapid descent), and a replacement aircraft was sent to the airport to board the passengers and complete the flight to Sacramento.\n\nWestern Airlines was serving the airport in the late 1940s with Douglas DC-3 flights to Los Angeles via stops at the Imperial County Airport (which serves El Centro), San Diego and Long Beach. Bonanza Air Lines, a \"local service\" air carrier as defined by the federal Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), began serving Yuma during the early 1950s. According to its March 1, 1953 system timetable, Bonanza was operating Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft into the airport with a daily westbound routing of Phoenix-Blythe-Yuma-El Centro-San Diego-Santa Ana-Los Angeles. At this same time, Bonanza was operating a daily eastbound DC-3 service with a routing of Los Angeles-Santa Ana-San Diego-El Centro-Yuma-Blythe-Phoenix-Prescott-Kingman-Las Vegas. By 1963, Bonanza had retired the DC-3 from its fleet and was operating all flights into the airport with new Fairchild F-27 turboprop aircraft. In 1964, the airline was operating nonstop F-27 propjet service to Phoenix with direct, no change of plane flights to San Diego and Los Angeles via an intermediate stop in El Centro. In 1968, Bonanza merged with Pacific Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which continued to serve the airport with the F-27 with nonstops to Phoenix as well as direct flights to Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Ana and Tucson. In late 1970, Air West was serving the airport with Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners with four flights a day including two nonstops to Phoenix (PHX) and two one-stop direct flights to Los Angeles (LAX) via an intermediate stop in El Centro (IPL). At this same time, one of the DC-9 jet flights to LAX operated continuing, no change of plane service to San Francisco, Portland, OR and Seattle via intermediate stops at other Air West destinations. Air West would then be renamed Hughes Airwest which in 1972 had ceased jet service into the airport but was still operating nonstop F-27 propjet flights to Phoenix with direct service to Los Angeles and San Diego via a stop in El Centro.\n\nBy 1980, Hughes Airwest had transitioned to an all-jet fleet and was no longer serving Yuma. Following the cessation of service by Hughes Airwest, a number of commuter and regional airlines operated flights over the years into the airport. America West Airlines served Yuma as well with nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet service to its hub in Phoenix prior to being merged into US Airways. The following is a list of airlines and aircraft that served Yuma from 1974 through 1999 primarily with flights to Phoenix (PHX) and/or Los Angeles (LAX) with this information being taken from various editions of the Official Airline Guide (OAG) over the years:\n\nAnother commuter airline that served Yuma was Air Cortez. In 1981, Air Cortez was operating nonstop service to Ontario, CA (ONT) with Beechcraft 18 prop aircraft. Air Cortez also operated international flights from the airport with service to Guaymas, Loreto and Mulege in Mexico.\n\nThe airport has been the location of flight testing of commercial jet airliners on several occasions in the past. In 1981, a wide body McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 in the livery of Continental Airlines was engaged in flight tests of new, retrofitted winglets. In 1990, McDonnell Douglas conducted flight tests with new McDonnell Douglas MD-11 wide body jetliners. In 1999, Boeing conducted flight tests with new Boeing 717-200 jetliners. Boeing then returned to the airport in 2011 and conducted flight tests of the new Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner.\n\nOver a span of many years the relationship between the airport and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (MCAS Yuma) deteriorated to an exceptional degree. In October 2006, the Yuma County Airport Authority (YCAA) brought in a new management team to solve the problem. On January 9, 2007, the new Airport Director presented a resolution to the YCAA board of directors which acknowledged that MCAS Yuma and YCAA share the use of the airfield, that MCAS Yuma was important to the Nation's security and that both MCAS Yuma and YCAA provide important economic benefits to the region through their respective aviation efforts.\n\nMost importantly, the resolution stated the YCAA identified itself as an \"Aviation Partner\" with MCAS Yuma and that the civilian Airport staff would work in a spirit of cooperation and goodwill with the military.\n\nThe Board unanimously approved the resolution. That first step initiated a transition between the two agencies. The term \"Aviation Partner\" became a focus of the airport in repairing the relationship. The result is what today is considered by many to be the best example of a Joint Use airfield between civilian and military operators in the nation.\n\nAeroCare/Guardian Flight and Air Methods/TriState CareFlight provide Air Ambulance services to Yuma and the surrounding region. Each company operates both fixed and rotary wing aircraft.\n\nOther tenants at Yuma International Airport include:\n\n"}

This colourless solid is of interest because it is more basic than pyridine, owing to the resonance stabilisation from the NMe substituent.\n\nBecause of its basicity, DMAP is a useful nucleophilic catalyst for a variety of reactions such as esterifications with anhydrides, the Baylis-Hillman reaction, hydrosilylations, tritylation, the Steglich rearrangement, Staudinger synthesis of β-lactams and many more. Chiral DMAP analogues are used in kinetic resolution experiments of mainly secondary alcohols and Evans auxiliary type amides.\n\nDMAP can be prepared in a two-step procedure from pyridine, which is first oxidized to 4-pyridylpyridinium cation. This cation then reacts with dimethylamine:\n\nIn the case of esterification with acetic anhydrides the currently accepted mechanism involves three steps. First, DMAP and acetic anhydride react in a pre-equilibrium reaction to form an ion pair of acetate and the acetylpyridinium ion. In the second step the alcohol adds to the acetylpyridinium, and elimination of pyridine forms an ester. Here the acetate acts as a base to remove the proton from the alcohol as it nucleophilically adds to the activated acylpyridinium. The bond from the acetyl group to the catalyst gets cleaved to generate the catalyst and the ester. The described bond formation and breaking process runs synchronous concerted without the appearance of a tetrahedral intermediate. The acetic acid formed will then protonate the DMAP. In the last step of the catalytic cycle the auxiliary base (usually triethylamine or pyridine) deprotonates the protonated DMAP, reforming the catalyst. The reaction runs through the described nucleophilic reaction pathway irrespective of the anhydride used, but the mechanism changes with the pKa value of the alcohol used. For example, the reaction runs through a base-catalyzed reaction pathway in the case of a phenol. In this case, DMAP acts as a base and deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenolate ion adds to the anhydride.\n\nDMAP has a relatively high toxicity and is particularly dangerous because of its ability to be absorbed through the skin. It is also corrosive.\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1932 to 1936.\n\nLawrence was born and educated in Burton upon Trent, England in 1887, and came to Canada in 1907. He worked as a railroad accountant for the Canadian National Railway, and became involved in the provincial labour movement in 1915. From 1917 to 1921, he served as general chairman of the Canadian Brotherhood Railroad Employees Western Lines.\n\nLawrence also became active in Manitoba's Independent Labour Party (ILP), and was first elected to the provincial legislature under its banner in the 1932 general election. Running in St. Boniface, he defeated longtime Conservative representative Joseph Bernier by 504 votes. Bernier actually defeated Lawrence by six votes on first preferences, but lost on transfers; the province was using the single transferable ballot at the time.\n\nFor the 1936 provincial election, the ILP ran candidates in an alliance with the newly formed Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).

President Ulysses S. Grant signed the act the day before his inauguration for a second term to double the salary of the president and those of Supreme Court Justices. The proposal for a salary increase was fueled by what was considered low pay for members in government, while the salary for the president was the same as it had been for George Washington. The bill subsequently included a 50 percent salary increase for the president and for members of Congress, retroactive to the beginning of their term, which was the most highly contested provision in the bill. Public outcry led Congress to rescind the congressional salary increase. As a protest against the act, Ohio ratified what later became the Twenty-seventh Amendment. The controversy surrounding the bill resulted in Republicans losing many seats, resulting in a Democratic majority in the House which began one of the most competitive two-party periods in American history.\n\nBefore legislation for an across the board increase in pay for government officials, officials in and out of government had complained that their salaries were insufficient to meet the expenses involved with their office and the high costs of living in Washington, D.C. The president's salary, at $25,000 a year, had not increased since George Washington was president, while the value of the dollar didn't have the same purchasing power. Congressional salaries had not been increased since 1852. While the government provided a house and a domestic staff for the president, Grant, like all presidents before him, paid for his own living expenses. Before passage of the act, salaries for members of Congress and Cabinet members were $5,000 and $8,000 respectively, significantly more than the wages for the average American. Members of Congress were also supposed to pay for their own residences while in Washington, where rents had increased as much as 25% since the Civil War. When President Grant abolished the franking privilege, a considerable yearly sum for government officials who frequently corresponded, their expenses increased further. Professional needs also prompted the effort to increase salaries for government officials. Members of Congress were not provided by the government with a professional staff. Thus any member who employed administrators or personal clerks had to pay them directly out of his own pocket. Any member who was not financially well-off and needed clerical assistance was faced with a financial hardship, as Washington was a very expensive place in which to live. To meet the cost of living many government officials were forced to take on other forms of employment on the side, often resuming their former professions, usually between Congressional sessions.\n\nThe idea of increasing the salaries for government officials with legislation that became known as the \"Salary Grab\" was conceived in the final days of the 42nd Congress, during the normal course of congressional business, and was first introduced on February 7, 1873, in the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Benjamin Butler, a Stalwart Republican from Massachusetts. The so called \"Salary Grab Act\" first attracted attention on February 7, 1873, put forth by Butler, from Massachusetts, who on that day stated that he had been directed by the Committee on the Judiciary to submit a bill lending itself to the subject of salaries in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, along with a report in writing from Butler, who stated, \"I desire to say that the report is not drawn by myself, but I present it by order of the committee, and I concur in its statements.\" The bill was received and read aloud twice, and submitted. On February 10, Butler motioned that the Committee on Appropriations be directed to include the salary increase in the Miscellaneous Appropriation Bill, for the committee's consideration. Butler also moved for a suspension of the rules in order to allow that this motion be entertained by the committee.\n\nThe amendment specified that the annual salary for Presidents, which at the time had remained unchanged since the presidency of George Washington, would double to $50,000, while the annual salaries of Supreme Court Justices and Cabinet members would increase to $10,000, and the annual salaries of civil servants would also increase. Moreover, members of Congress would receive a pay increase from $5,000 to $7,500 annually. The congressional increase would be retroactive to the beginning of the 42nd Congress, almost two full years earlier. This meant that all members of Congress would receive a lump sum payment of roughly $4,000 for \"services rendered\" when the session came to a close. The House, on 24 February 1873, assembled to conduct the routine procedure of working out a legislative appropriations bill.\n\nBoth Houses acted immediately and passed the conference bill; the House by a 102–95 vote, and the Senate by a 36–27 vote, whereafter President Grant signed the bill into law on March 3, 1873, the final day of the 42nd Congress. In little time the proposed salary increase in congressional salaries became a controversial issue in all branches of government as well as with much of the general public and the press. \nThe newspapers immediately characterized the pay raise as the \"Salary Grab Act\" and associated its promotion to the recent Crédit Mobilier scandal, and accused the governing Republican majority in Congress of perpetuating an atmosphere of corruption. Most of the criticism, especially from Liberal reformers, was aimed at Republicans. Along with the Crédit Mobilier scandal, the so-called Salary Grab Act or \"Salary steal\" fueled a widespread notion that the party in power was hopelessly corrupt. However, the connection of the Liberals with the \"salary grab\" was easily open to criticism. Four Liberal senators and one representative supported the salary increases, and never returned their back pay.\n\nElihu Washburne, Minister to France, who was a Republican himself and former ally of Grant, writing from Paris, characterized Congress as \"simply a gang of thieves...what a pity the President did not veto the salary steal\". President Grant reasoned that blocking the bill would have rendered all three branches of government underfunded, requiring the new 43rd Congress to conduct a special session to start the process all over again. Due to the large public outcry, and in an attempt to deflect criticism, a few of the Senators and Representatives returned their bonuses to the United States government Treasury Department, while others donated it to colleges or charities. However, the criticism persisted, and the Republicans lost ninety-six seats in the House, including Butler. The huge loss resulted in the Democratic party returning to prominence for the first time since before the Civil War. As a result, the 1874 election initiated one of the most competitive two-party periods in American history, lasting more than twenty years. During the opening of the next Congress, 20 January 1874, House members repealed the Appropriation Act, sustaining only the salary increases for the President and Supreme Court Justices, while all others abandoned any hope of a continuing salary increase. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2183065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183065", "title": "Hylton Castle", "text": "Hylton Castle\n\nHylton Castle ( ) is a stone castle in the North Hylton area of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England. Originally built from wood by the Hilton (later Hylton) family shortly after the Norman Conquest in 1066, it was later rebuilt in stone in the late 14th to early 15th century. The castle underwent major changes to its interior and exterior in the 18th century and it remained the principal seat of the Hylton family until the death of the last Baron in 1746. It was then Gothicised but neglected until 1812, when it was revitalised by a new owner. Standing empty again until the 1840s, it was briefly used as a school until it was purchased again in 1862. The site passed to a local coal company in the early 20th century and was taken over by the state in 1950.\n\nOne of the castle's main features is the range of heraldic devices found mainly on the west façade, which have been retained from the castle's original construction. They depict the coats of arms belonging to local gentry and peers of the late 14th to early 15th centuries and provide an approximate date of the castle's reconstruction from wood to stone.\n\nToday, the castle is owned by English Heritage, a charity which manages the historical environment of England. The surrounding parkland is maintained by a community organisation. The castle and its chapel are protected as a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. In February, 2016, plans were announced to turn the castle into a community facility and visitor attraction, with the Heritage Lottery Fund awarding £2.9 million, and Sunderland Council £1.5 million, to provide classrooms, a cafe and rooms for exhibitions, meetings and events.\n\nThe Hylton family had been settled in England since the reign of King Athelstan (c.895–939). At this time, Adam de Hylton gave to the monastery of Hartlepool a pyx or crucifix, weighing in silver and emblazoned with his coat of arms – argent, two bars azure. On the arrival of William the Conqueror, Lancelot de Hilton and his two sons, Robert and Henry, joined the Conqueror's forces, but Lancelot was killed at Faversham during William's advance to London. In gratitude, the king granted the eldest son, Henry, a large tract of land on the banks of the River Wear.\n\nThe first castle on the site, built by Henry de Hilton in about 1072, was likely to have been built of wood. It was subsequently re-built in stone by Sir William Hylton (1376–1435) as a four-storey, gatehouse-style, fortified manor house, similar in design to Lumley and Raby. Although called a gatehouse, it belongs to a type of small, late-14th-century castle, similar to Old Wardour, Bywell and Nunney castles. The castle was first mentioned in a household inventory taken in 1448, as \"a gatehouse constructed of stone\" and although no construction details survive, it is believed the stone castle was built sometime between 1390 and the early 15th century, due to the coat of arms featured above the west entrance (see Heraldry below). It has been suggested that Sir William intended to erect a larger castle in addition to the gatehouse, but abandoned his plan.\n\nThe household inventory taken on Sir William's death in 1435 mentions, in addition to the castle, a hall, four chambers, two barns, a kitchen, and the chapel, indicating the existence of other buildings on the site at that time. Apart from the castle and chapel, the other buildings were probably all of timber. In 1559, the gatehouse featured in another household inventory as the \"Tower\", when floors and galleries were inserted to subdivide the great hall.\n\nThe eccentric Henry Hylton, \"de jure\" 12th Baron Hylton left the castle to the City of London Corporation on his death in 1641, to be used for charitable purposes for ninety-nine years. It was returned to the family after the Restoration, to Henry's nephew, John Hylton, \"de jure\" 15th Baron Hylton.\n\nEarly in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), the second son of Henry Hylton, \"de jure\" 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the interior to form a three-storeyed block (one room on each floor). He also inserted large, alternating, pedimented sash windows in the Italianate style and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728). A doorway to the new wing was added and approached by a semi-circular staircase. Above the doorway was a coat of arms, believed to be the one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave. It is now located above the doorway to \"The Golden Lion Inn\" at South Hylton, on the opposite side of the River Wear.\n\nAfter 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, \"de jure\" 18th Baron Hylton added a complementary south wing (its foundation wall still extant), crenellations to both wings and removed the door on the north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan on the north end of the west front, to an octagonal turret and removed the portcullis from the west entrance.\n\nWhen the 18th and last \"baron\" died without male heirs in 1746, the castle passed to his nephew, Sir Richard Musgrave, Bt, who took the name of Hylton. It was sold by a private bill (23 Geo. II c.21) in 1749. The new owner was to be a Mr. Wogan who returned from the East Indies to buy the castle for £30,550 (£3.7 million in 2007), but the sale never went through. It was instead bought by Lady Bowes, the widow of Sir George Bowes of Streatlam and Gibside in County Durham. No record of her, or any of her family, ever taking up residence exists and the castle later passed to her grandson, John Bowes, 10th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. At this time, a stucco decoration (long since disappeared) to the wine and drawing rooms was added by Pietro La Francini, who worked for Daniel Garrett (who had worked for Lady Bowes on Gibside Banqueting House). William Howitt's \"Visits to Remarkable Places\" (1842) notes the rooms had \"stuccoed ceilings, with figures, busts on the walls, and one large scene which seemed to be Venus and Cupid, Apollo fiddling to the gods, Minerva in her helmet, and an old king\". Garrett probably designed the Gothic porch installed in the west entrance and the Gothic screen and single-storey, bow-fronted rooms installed to close off the east entrance.\n\nAfter a long period of remaining empty, the castle slowly began to decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable. He re-roofed the chapel (allowing it to be used for public worship again), added battlements to the wings and cultivated the gardens. However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.\n\nBy 1834, the castle was unoccupied again. In 1840, an advert was placed in the \"Newcastle Courant\" by Revd. John Wood for \"Hylton Castle Boarding School\" and the 1841 census shows Wood, his family, pupils and staff as living on the estate. Joseph Swan was one of the pupils there around this time. The school does not seem to have existed for long as Howitt commented in 1842, that it was \"a scene of great desolation ... the windows for the most part, all along the front, are boarded up ... the whole of this large old house is now empty ... and in the most desolate state\". However, he does go on to say the kitchen was occupied a poor family. By 1844, the chapel was used as a carpenter's workshop, and according to the \"Durham Chronicle\" in January 1856, the castle set on fire while in the occupation of a farmer, Mr. Maclaren.\n\nIn 1862, the castle was put up for sale by the Strathmores and purchased by William Briggs, a local timber merchant and ship builder. Briggs set about to change the appearance of the castle to what he believed to be more \"authentic[ally] medieval\". He demolished the north and south wings, gutted the interior and added one, two and three-light cusp-headed windows. He also replaced the Gothic porch with a more \"severe\" Gothic doorway (three-bayed with cinquefoil arches) and an overhead balcony. To carry out these changes to the west front, he moved the stone-carved Hylton banner from above the west entrance to the front, left-flanking tower. The interior walls of the four-vaulted ground floor rooms were demolished, the whole floor was raised three-and-a-half feet and two reception rooms were formed. At the east end of the former central passage, dog-leg stairs were constructed leading to the first floor, requiring removal of the oratory and rendering the main staircase inaccessible from the ground floor. The side walls of the great hall were removed to create a large salon and a large bay window was added to the south façade, where the entrance to the south wing would have been. The rooms above were kept untouched, except that a new entrance to the family/chaplain's room had to be formed via the main staircase.\n\nAlongside the medieval masonry, Briggs' alterations can still be seen today (albeit in ruins). Briggs' son, Colonel Charles James Briggs (father of Sir Charles James Briggs) inherited the castle in 1871 and built the nearby St Margaret's church (now demolished).\n\nAfter Colonel Brigg's death in 1900, the castle passed into the hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board. Due to the expansion of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became surrounded by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof.\n\nIn 1994, Channel 4's \"Time Team\" undertook excavations on the Eastern Terrace. Their investigations revealed evidence of a medieval hall to the east of the castle; it has been suggested that the hall was used as a dining area.\n\nA chapel dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria is known to have existed on the site since 1157, when the Prior of Durham agreed to allow Romanus de Hilton to appoint his own chaplain for the chapel, subject to the prior's approval. In return, de Hilton was to provide an annual contribution of 24 sheaves of oats for every draught ox he owned, to the nearby monastery at Monkwearmouth, and was required to attend the mother church of St Peters for the feasts of the Nativity, Easter, Whitsuntide and Saints Peter and Paul. In 1322, there was a chantry dedicated to the Virgin Mary and there were three chantry priests in 1370.\n\nThe chapel, which is on a small embankment to the north east of the castle, was rebuilt in stone in the early 15th century. It was modified from the late 15th to late 16th century, when a Perpendicular Gothic, five-light east window and transepts were added. Bucks' engraving of 1728, shows a short nave and a large six-light west window, and that the chapel was disused by this time, as it had no roof. The west façade of the chapel was later demolished and the chancel arch was built up to form a new one with a Gibbs surround. A bell-turret was added c. 1805. On the north and south sides of the chapel are two transeptal, semi-octagonal bays.\n\nAlthough repairs to the chapel were carried out by the last Baron Hylton and the successive owners in the 19th century, it fell into disrepair until, like the castle, it was taken over by the state in 1950.\n\nThe castle and chapel have been Grade I listed buildings since 1949 and form a Scheduled Ancient Monument under the care of English Heritage, who took over the site in 1984, although Sunderland City Council own the land. In 1999, the \"Friends of Hylton Dene\" group was formed by residents of the estates around North Hylton \"with the aim of co-operating with Sunderland City Council, Durham Wildlife Trust and other agencies to actively involve the local community in the development and upkeep of Hylton Dene and Castle\". In December 2007, the group was awarded £50,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out a survey for the future for the site. Once restored, the castle could be opened. The chairman of the Castle in the Community John Coulthard described the castle, Sunderland's second oldest building, as \"an asset in the city – it is a lovely setting and we would love to see it bring in some income\".\n\nThere have been four organised International Reunion(s) of Hylton Families over the past few years; most notably on 4 July 2004, when around fifty American descendants of the Hylton family visited the castle to present a flag featuring the Hylton blazon. The flag now flies from the recently installed flagpole, provided by English Heritage.\n\nThe west façade of the castle has square towers flanking the central bay, with others at the south west and north west, all topped with octagonal, machicolated turrets. The north and south façades are relatively simple. The east façade has a central projection in the centre rising a storey above the parapet, to form a tower. The tower's south angle is splayed to accommodate the main staircase and only the corbels of its parapet survive. The screen closing off the east entrance has a three-bay cusped arcade on the ground floor and three ogee arches on the shafts above.\n\nThe roof was originally covered with sheet lead and adorning the roof are stone warriors and other figures, similar to those of Raby, Alnwick and the gates of York. Originally there were four figures on each corner turret and bartizan; only five have survived. Between the central towers once stood a sculpture of a knight in combat with a serpent (of which only fragments survive), believed to pertain to the tale of the Lambton Worm. The parapet is also machicolated (except on the north façade) and continued between the central towers by a carved-foliage arch (originally with cusping which fell in 1882), instead of corbels. Another feature of the roof was shallow stone troughs on the battlements which fed scalding oil or water into the machiocaltions as a means of defence. In a small chamber in each turret or bastion, a brazier was kept burning to bring the liquids to a suitable temperature.\n\nBefore the changes made by John Hylton (died 1712), the castle's layout plan was as follows:\n\nThe ground floor, accessed directly from the outside courtyard, led into a portcullis-protected, vaulted passage, eleven feet wide and extending the depth of the building. On either side of the passage were two vaulted rooms. The room nearest the entrance on the right was a guardroom or the porter's room, which housed a well; the back-right room, with a garderobe located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official. The other two rooms to the left were used to house staff or storage.\n\nThe first was floor was accessed via the main staircase, situated in the east tower. The first room encountered was the great hall, which rose three floors. To the viewer's immediate left was a kitchen (with clerestory lighting), and further on to the left was a butlery and pantry with a garderobe. To the viewer's back right was a small passage containing a private staircase and the entrance to the oratory (its roof vaulted with an east window) in the east tower. The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch doorway and contained an altar and piscina, of which only an ornamental niche remains. There was a fireplace on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the great chamber containing a fireplace, garderobe and a window seat on the east wall. To the west of the hall was the head of the west window. The portcullis is believed to have been raised into the hall in front of this window.\n\nThe kitchen, oratory and great chamber rose two floors, therefore only the minstrels' gallery was accessed via the main staircase on the second floor. However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a staircase in that room or via the gallery.\n\nThe rooms on the north and east sides of the third floor were accessed via the private staircase. The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber. The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room. Both were connected via a lobby at the top of the private staircase.\n\nThe room on the south side (separated by the other rooms due to the hall's height) was accessed via the main staircase. This room also had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was probably used by guests.\n\nAbove the small family/chaplain's room on the third floor, was the servant's room with a corner fireplace and two windows on the mezzanine floor, accessed via the main staircase. Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small windows in the east wall and a garderobe. There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.\n\nThe castle and chapel are adorned with heraldic devices and shields of arms, providing information as to when the castle was constructed.\n\nAbove the main entrance on the western façade of the castle, there are twenty shields of arms. They are believed to show the political alliances of the early Hyltons, as the banner of the king, and the arms of nobles and knights of Northumberland and the County Palatine of Durham are shown. In relation to the photograph, the shields are:\n\nAlthough it was necessary for Briggs to move the Hylton banner to make way for a new entrance, it can be seen from a colour version of Bucks' engraving that the shields were previously placed not as they are today (particularly Weston and Skirlaw's). Briggs is believed to have re-arranged the shields, disrupting their original hierarchical arrangement. Nevertheless, the arms give a date for the construction and completion of the castle as between 1390 and the early 15th century, due to the following reasons:\n\nThe east façade of the castle features a slanted shield containing the Hylton arms (Argent, two bars Azure) and a white hart (male deer), lodged, chained and collared with a coronet, Or. The hart is possibly the badge used by Richard II of England (indicating construction began before Richard's deposition in 1399) or an earlier crest used by the family after it was granted by William I of England, in reward for the services of the previously mentioned Lancelot de Hilton. A \"Moses head\" (the crest of the Hylton arms) also features on the east façade.\n\nThere is a local tradition that Hylton Castle is haunted by the spirit of Robert Skelton, known as the Cauld (a pronunciation of \"cold\" in Mackem) Lad of Hylton. Various versions of how he was killed exist, the most popular being that he was decapitated by Sir Robert Hylton (later \"de jure\" 13th Baron Hylton), after falling asleep and failing to get his master's horse ready on time. Skelton's spirit then began to haunt the castle and would move objects, either misplacing them or tidying up. The spirit was said to have been finally laid to rest when the castle servants put a cloak out for him.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2183067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183067", "title": "José Offerman", "text": "José Offerman\n\nJosé Antonio Offerman Dono (born November 8, 1968) is a Dominican retired professional baseball player who played professional baseball for nearly 20 years. He played for 15 seasons in the Major League Baseball and has played 4 seasons of independent and Mexican League baseball since leaving MLB.\n\nHe most recently managed the Licey Tigers of the Dominican Winter League, leading them to the 2008–2009 and 2013–2014 Dominican Winter League Championship. During a baseball game on January 16, 2010, Offerman attacked an umpire during an argument and, as a result, was banned from the Winter League for three years. He managed the Rojos del Águila de Veracruz of the Mexican League in 2014.\n\nAfter attending Colegio Biblico Cristiano High School in San Pedro de Macorís, Offerman signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1986. In , he completed his first season of professional play being named as Best Prospect in the Pioneer League. Progressing rapidly through the minor leagues, he made his major league debut against the Montreal Expos on August 19, becoming the 55th player in major league history to hit a home run in his first major league at-bat.\n\nBy , Offerman became the Dodgers' starting shortstop. On opening day 1993, he was the first batter to ever face the Florida Marlins, striking out against Charlie Hough. He made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 1995 but was traded to the Kansas City Royals after the season, mostly because of his very poor defense. After a year as a utility player, he won the starting second baseman job in 1997. Offerman had his best offensive seasons in Kansas City, culminating in , when he hit .315 with a league-leading 13 triples and the fifth most stolen bases, 45. After that season, he signed with the Boston Red Sox as a free agent, making the All-Star Game for the second time in 1999.\n\nKnown more for his hitting skills than his fielding, Offerman's offense began to decline in . He was sent to the Seattle Mariners during the season, but was released afterwards. In , he joined the Montreal Expos in spring training but was cut before the regular season began. He spent the entire year with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the independent Atlantic League. In , he won a spot on the Minnesota Twins roster and led the league in pinch-hits with 12 in 29 attempts. He started with the Philadelphia Phillies but was released after a slow start. Later, he signed with the New York Mets and was called back up to the majors in June.\n\nMost recently, Offerman played in the 2008 Caribbean World Series for the Licey Tigers – Dominican Republic 2 team – where he assisted the team in winning its 10th Caribbean World Series title. During the series he signed a contract with the 2008 Veracruz Red Eagles of the Mexican Summer League.\n\nIn December, 2008, Offerman was named player-manager of Licey Tigers of the Dominican Winter League. With Offerman as manager, Licey swept the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five straight against the Gigantes del Cibao. As champions, Licey was then invited to participate in the 2009 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager (the series was ultimately won by Venezuela). (The Caribbean World Series is affiliated with the Winter League programs of Major League Baseball, featuring MLB players and prospects from the Dominican Winter League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.)\n\nOn January 7, 2014, Offerman was again named manager of the Licey Tigers of the Dominican Winter League, replacing Mike Guerrero. With Offerman at the helm, Licey won the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five games to three over the Leones del Escogido. As champions again, Licey has been invited to the 2014 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager. At present, his team has qualified for the semifinals of the tournament.\n\nHe has not played or managed professional baseball in the United States since 2007. On August 14, 2007, while playing for the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, Offerman was thrown out of a game against the Bridgeport Bluefish for charging Bluefish pitcher Matt Beech with a bat after he was hit by a pitch. Beech sustained broken finger in the resulting melee. Bluefish catcher John Nathans was also hit in the back of the head during the bench-clearing melee, receiving a severe concussion that effectively ended his playing career. Beech and Nathans were taken to Bridgeport Hospital where they were treated and released. After being removed from the game, Offerman was arrested by the Bridgeport Police.\n\nOn August 15, 2007, he was suspended indefinitely. The independent Atlantic League announced on August 17, 2007 that Offerman would remain suspended at least until the legal case was resolved.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, Offerman pleaded not guilty to two second degree assault charges.\n\nHis case was pending in Bridgeport Superior Court GA#2 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He was represented by Attorney Frank J. Riccio II. On October 30, 2007, Offerman was given two years special probation called \"Accelerated Rehabilitation ('AR').\" The Court determined that his actions on August 14, 2007 were of an aberrant nature. The Court also found that Offerman is not likely to offend again in the future.\n\nNathans filed a $4.8 million civil suit against Offerman in February 2009, claiming that he still has post-concussion syndrome and that the injury allegedly caused by Offerman ended his baseball career.\nOn July 29, 2014, Nathans won his suit, and Offerman was ordered to pay $940,000.\n\nOn 16 January 2010, Offerman once again engaged in an on-field assault when he struck an umpire while managing a Dominican Republic winter league game. Offerman, manager of the Licey Tigers, came onto the field during the third inning while losing a 6-0 game to the Cibao Giants, to protest ejection of his catcher for arguing balls and strikes and ended up arguing with first-base umpire D.J. Reyburn. He swung with a right hook at Reyburn, who then fell to the ground. Offerman was detained by stadium security, eventually being transported to the local police station to await the end of the game and Reyburn's decision whether to ask for charges to be pressed against him or not.\n\nA day after the incident, the American crew that umpired the game resigned their positions with the Dominican Baseball League and left the country, reportedly due to threats and concerns about their own safety. Because of this incident Offerman received a lifetime ban from the Dominican Republic Winter League, a suspension that was eventually lifted in February 2013. Coincidentally, at the time he was suspended, Offerman was replacing Dave Jauss as Licey manager after Jauss was suspended himself for two years for bumping an umpire during a playoff game.\n\nHe is the father of WWE ring announcer and former reality television star JoJo Offerman.\n\n\n"}

The airport is serviced by American Airlines (SkyWest as American Eagle) and United Airlines (Trans States Airlines as United Express), and is also used for general aviation. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 51,765 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 66,627 in 2009 and 62,109 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 called it a \"primary commercial service\" airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).\n\nThe airport covers at an elevation of . Its one runway, 3/21, is asphalt.\n\nIn the year ending December 31, 2017, the airport had 43,527 aircraft operations, an average of 119 per day: 67% general aviation, 25% air taxi, 2% military, and 5% airline. 115 aircraft were then based at the airport: 88% single-engine, 5% multi-engine, 3% jet, 3% helicopter, and 2% ultralight.\n\nHistorically, Flagstaff was served in the late 1940s by Arizona Airways which merged into Frontier Airlines in 1950. Douglas DC-3, Convair 340, and Convair 580 turboprops were used on flights to Phoenix as well as direct, no change of plane service to Denver via Gallup, NM, Farmington, NM and Durango, CO. Occasionally direct flights were also operated to Albuquerque via Winslow, AZ and Gallup, NM. Frontier's service ended in 1979.\n\nSeveral commuter airlines served Flagstaff in the 1970s and early 1980s with flights primarily to Phoenix. These included Cochise Airlines, Desert Air Service, Desert Pacific Airlines, SunWest Airlines, and SkyWest Airlines. These airlines operated commuter turboprop aircraft including Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners, Beechcraft C99s, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters, Cessna 402s, and Piper Navajos. Cochise Airlines served Flagstaff from 1973 through 1979 with flights to Phoenix. SunWest Airlines provided service from 1982 through 1985 with flights to Phoenix and to Albuquerque with a stop in Gallup, NM. SkyWest Airlines started service in the late 1970s operating independently at first then in 1985 began operating as Western Express on behalf of Western Airlines. In 1987 Western merged into Delta Air Lines which in turn changed the code-share service to Delta Connection. The carrier continued flying between Flagstaff and Phoenix as well as a flight to Las Vegas with stops in Page, AZ and St. George, UT using the Swearingen Metroliner until 1994. American Eagle, operated by Wings West Airlines, served Flagstaff on behalf of American Airlines from 1986 through 1987 also using Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner turboprops to Phoenix.\nAmerica West Airlines began service in 1987 using de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops flying to the carriers hubs' in Phoenix and Las Vegas (one-stop via the Grand Canyon). America West Boeing 737-200 jetliners appeared occasionally at the airport as a back up for their Dash 8 service. America West then turned this operation over to Mesa Airlines in 1992 which flew Beechcraft 1900D and occasionally Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops as America West Express between Flagstaff and Phoenix. In 1996 up to 16 daily flights were operated to Phoenix, one every hour. Flights were upgraded back to Dash 8's in 1998 and America West merged with US Airways in 2007 which in turn continued to serve Flagstaff as US Airways Express with flights to Phoenix. In 2012 all flights were upgraded to 50-seat Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets which marks the first time that all flights serving Flagstaff have been operated with jet aircraft. US Airways was subsequently merged into American Airlines in 2015 which then saw a return of American Eagle service. The Phoenix flights were upgraded once again in 2017 to 70-seat Canadair CRJ-700's operated by SkyWest Airlines. During the summer of 2018, a single flight was operated to Los Angeles on Saturday only using the SkyWest CRJ-700. \n\nHorizon Air, a subsidiary of the Alaska Air Group (which also operates Alaska Airlines), operated Bombardier Q400 flights to Los Angeles, some stopping in Prescott, AZ, from 2008 through 2010. The 76-seat Q400 is the largest and fastest member of the DHC-8 Dash 8 family of aircraft.\n\nSkyWest Airlines operating as American Eagle continues to operate scheduled passenger flights serving the airport with Canadair CRJ-700 regional jets to the American Airlines hub at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and added new flights to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on April 2, 2019. Occasionally some Phoenix flights are operated by Mesa Airlines using the 76-seat Canadair CRJ-900 regional jet.\n\nTrans States Airlines operating as United Express via a code sharing agreement with United Airlines began flights on March 31, 2019 from Flagstaff to the United Airlines hub at Denver International Airport.

{"id": "2183090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183090", "title": "Anaphora (liturgy)", "text": "Anaphora (liturgy)\n\nThe Anaphora is the most solemn part of the Divine Liturgy, or the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, during which the offerings of bread and wine are consecrated as the body and blood of Christ. This is the usual name for this part of the Liturgy in Greek-speaking Eastern Christianity. In western Christian traditions which have a comparable rite, the Anaphora is more often called the Eucharistic Prayer for the four modern anaphoras in the Latin liturgy, with the first anaphora having the additional name of the Roman Canon . When the Roman Rite had a single Eucharistic Prayer (between the Council of Trent and Vatican II), it was called the Canon of the Mass.\n\n\"Anaphora\" is a Greek word () meaning a \"carrying back\" (hence its meaning in rhetoric and linguistics) or a \"carrying up\", and so an \"offering\" (hence its use in reference to the offering of sacrifice to God). In the sacrificial language of the Greek version of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint, (prospherein) is used of the offerer's bringing the victim \"to\" the altar, and (anapherein) is used of the priest's offering \"up\" the selected portion upon the altar (see, for instance, , , , ).\n\nTo describe the structure of the Anaphoras as it became standardized from the 4th century, we can look at the structure of the anaphoras in the Antiochene (or \"\"West Syrian\"\") family of liturgies, which display an order and logic that finds no equal elsewhere. This structure is still valid, with some significant variations typical of each rite, for the Catholic Church, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Church, while it was modified, both in the pattern and in the underlying theology, during the Protestant Reformation. Beginning with the Oxford Movement of the 1840s and after the Liturgical Reform Movement of the 1950s, a systematic examination of historic anaphoras began and this in turn has caused the reform of many Eucharistic prayers within mainline Protestant denominations.\n\nThe structure of the standardized 4th century Antiochene anaphora, which is placed after the offertory and the Creed and comes before the Lord's Prayer, the Elevation and the Communion rites, can be summarized as follows:\n\nThis structure can have variations in liturgical families different from the Antiochene one: in the East Syriac Rites the Epiclesis is just before the final doxology and in one case the Institution narrative is missing; the Intercessions can be found after the Preface in the Alexandrian Rite and even before the Sursum Corda in the Mozarabic Rite. An Epiclesis can be found before the Institution narrative in the Alexandrian Rite, and this place of the Epiclesis is the standard in the Roman Canon and in the Latin rites.\n\nThe anaphoras are addressed by the Church to the Father, even if in antiquity there were cases of Eucharistic prayers addressed to Christ, as the anaphora of Gregory Nazianzen or partially the Third Anaphora of St. Peter (\"Sharar\"). Also, the Ethiopian Orthodox Täwaḥədo Church unusually has an Anaphora of the Virgin Mary. Most parts of the anaphora, as the Preface, the Institution narrative, the Epiclesis, are always reserved to the celebrant, a bishop or a priest, while the faithfuls usually sung the Sanctus and some acclamations, which can be more or less frequent and length according to the specific rite. Sometime, particularly in the past, in both East and West the main celebrant said a part of his prayers inaudibly or covered by the choir.\n\nThe Eastern Rites know many anaphoras, but each of them is almost completely invariable. On the contrary the Western Church had for centuries only one anaphora, the Roman Canon, but it has variable parts according to the liturgical year, mainly the Preface. In other Latin rites, as in the Mozarabic Rite or the Gallican rite also the post-sanctus and the prayer after the Institution narrative till the doxology are completely variable.\n\nMany ancient texts of anaphoras have survived, and even if no more in use, they are useful to trace the history of the anaphoras, and in general the history of the Eucharist during the centuries. Most of these texts became parts of anaphoras still in use.\n\nThe earlier liturgical texts related to the celebration of the Eucharist are the chapters 9 and 10 of the Didache, even if there is not consensus among scholars if these texts are meant to be a Eucharist or not. We have next the Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition, called also the anaphora of Hippolytus, the Liturgy of the seventh book of the Apostolic Constitutions and the Liturgy of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions that developed in the famous Byzantine Anaphora now part of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, through the lost Greek version of the Anaphora of the Twelve Apostles (of which we have a later Syrian version).\n\nThe more ancient text of the Basilean family of anaphoras was found in 1960 in a Sahidic Coptic version, possibly a text written by St. Basil himself, and recent scholars believes that this text, united with the anaphora described in \"The Catechisms\" of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, has been the base for the Anaphora of St. James included in the Liturgy of St James. The present Byzantine text of the Anaphora included in the Liturgy of Saint Basil is the final development of this anaphoric family.\n\nIn the East the more ancient text is probably the ancient form of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, followed by the Maronite Third Anaphora of St. Peter (said also \"Sharar\") and by the Anaphora of Mar Theodore. Another important source is the anaphora described in the \"Mystagogical Cathecheses\" of Theodore of Mopsuestia.\n\nIn Egypt we have the Anaphora of Barcellona (and its related Louvain Coptic Papyrus), the Prayer into the Euchologion of Serapion, the Deir Balyzeh Papyrus, the Strasbourg papyrus and the ancient Anaphora of Saint Mark in Greek, which developed in the Coptic Liturgy of Saint Cyril.\n\nScholars find structural similarities in between the Roman and Egyptian anaphoral traditions: for instance the Barcelona Papyrus, as well as Deir Balyzeh Papyrus, include an epiclesis before the Words of Institution as in the Roman Canon. The earliest text similar to the Roman Canon is the quoted in \"De Sacramentis\" of Ambrose which include prayers close to the Canon's prayers such as \"Quam Oblationem\", \"Qui pridie\", \"Unde et Memores\", \"Supra quae - Suplices te\". The Roman Canon's prayers \"Communicantes\", \"Hanc igitur\", and the post-consecration \"Memento etiam\" and \"Nobis quoque\" were added in the 5th century, and it achieved practically its present form when modified by Gregory the Great (590-604) (see History of the Roman Canon).\n\nWhen referring to the Western Christian uses, the term \"\"Eucharistic Prayer\"\" is more used than \"\"anaphora\"\", and sometime it refers only to the portion of the anaphora starting after the Sanctus because the Preface in the Latin rites is variable and follows the liturgical year.\n\nBetween the Council of Trent and the reform of the Catholic Mass (liturgy), undertaken in 1969 (see Mass of Paul VI), the only anaphora used in the Roman Rite was the Roman Canon (or \"Canon of the Mass\"). For the history of the \"Roman Canon\" see also articles Canon of the Mass, Pre-Tridentine Mass and Tridentine Mass.\n\nWith introduction in 1969 of the Mass of Paul VI, it was allowed to have multiple choices of Eucharistic Prayer, however the authorization of new Eucharistic Prayers is reserved to the Holy See. All the new Eucharistic Prayers follow the Antiochene structure with the noticeable difference that the Epiclesis is placed, according to the uses of the Roman tradition, before the Words of Institution and not after.\nThe first approved Eucharistic Prayers are four:\n\nIn the years after the reform of Pope Paul VI other Eucharistic Prayers were authorized:\n\nA typical characteristic of the Latin rites different from the Roman Rite is the great variability of portions of the Roman Canon which change according to the liturgical year and the Mass.\nThe Mozarabic Rite has as variable texts the \"Illatio\" (i.e. the Preface), the Post-Sanctus and the \"Post-Pridie\", that is the prayer said between the Institution narrative and the doxology in place of the Intercessions which are placed before the Sursum Corda. In the Gallican Rite the Preface is named \"Contestatio\" or \"Immolatio\" and the Institution narrative is named \"Secreta\" or \"Mysterium\"\n\nThe Ambrosian Rite during the centuries has lost its ancient variety, even if it maintains a richness of choices for the Preface and its first Eucharistic Prayer is slightly different form the Roman one mainly in the Words of Institution. Recently two typical additional ancient Eucharistic Prayers have been restored, to be used mainly on Easter and Holy Thursday.\n\nThe Western Rite Orthodoxy uses adaptations to the Orthodox nous of the Roman Canon (Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory) or of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer (Divine Liturgy of Saint Tikhon) or own reconstructions of ancient Gallican liturgies (Liturgy of Saint Germanus or The Liturgy of Saint John the Divine).\n\nThe United Methodist Church has twenty-two Eucharistic Prayers that are modeled on the pattern of the Antiochene pattern; these are contained in the Book of Worship. The \"notion of a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving\", dating back to Irenaeus, is emphasized in the United Methodist Church's \"anamnesis and offering: 'And so in remembrance of these your mighty acts in Jesus Christ, we offer ourselves as a holy and living sacrifice, in union with Christ's offering for us, as we proclaim the mystery of faith: Christ has died...'\" The Methodist Rite, as with the Presbyterian liturgy, places the Memorial Acclamation \"after the anamnesis and offering\". In both the Methodist Church of Great Britain and The United Methodist Church, the \"post-Sanctus transitioned almost immediately to the Institution Narrative\". In addition, the \"offering was our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, and ourselves,\" reflecting the theology of Thomas Cranmer and Methodism's Anglican patrimony in general.\n\nThis important liturgical family includes many well studied historical anaphoras, as the \"Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition\", the Liturgy of the seventh book of the \"Apostolic Constitutions\" and the \"Liturgy of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions\". The main currently used anaphoras belonging to this family are the following, divided by rite:\n\nThe Byzantine Rite uses three anaphoras, which are the core part of the Divine Liturgies which take the same name:\n\nThe anaphora is introduced with the Opening Dialogue between priest and choir/congregation:\n\nWhile the above response is sung, the priest begins to pray the first part of the anaphora quietly, although in some places this is said aloud. This section, corresponding to the Preface in the Roman Rite, gives thanks to God for the mysteries of creation, redemption, and sanctification. It is followed by the choir and congregation singing the Sanctus.\n\nAfter the Sanctus follows a recapitulation of salvation history, especially the Incarnation, and leads into the words of Jesus over the bread and wine at the Mystical Supper, as Eastern Christians often refer to the Last Supper: \"Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you, for the forgiveness of sins.\" and \"Drink ye all of this; this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\" The priest always says these words aloud, and the congregation and choir respond: \"Amen.\"\n\nThe priest continues with the Anamnesis in that it references Jesus' command, at least implicitly, to \"do this in memory of me\" and states that the gifts of bread and wine are offered to God in memory of Jesus' life, death, resurrection, and second coming. It culminates with the Oblation in which the bread and wine is lifted up while the priest exclaims: \"Thine own of thine own we offer unto thee on behalf of all and for all.\"\n\nWhile the people sing a hymn of thanksgiving and supplication, the priest prays the epiclesis. God the Father is invoked to send down the Holy Spirit in order to, according to the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, \"...make this bread the precious Body of thy Christ... And that which is in this cup the precious Blood of thy Christ... Changing them by thy Holy Spirit.\" This is the most solemn point of the anaphora, as it is from that point on the bread and wine are considered to be the literal body and blood of Christ and not from the Words of Institution as in some other traditions.\n\nThe rest of the anaphora consists of a lengthy set of intercessions for the Church, its bishops and other clergy, the leaders of nations, the faithful departed, and the Church as a whole, as well as commemorations of the Saints, especially the Blessed Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, the saint being commemorated that day, and \"Forefathers, Fathers, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Preachers, Evangelists, Martyrs, Confessors, Ascetics, and for every righteous spirit in faith made perfect.\" In the Byzantine Rite the anaphora, whether that of St. John Chrysostom or St. Basil, ends with the following doxology sung by the priest: \"And grant us with one mouth and one heart to glorify and hymn thine all-honorable and magnificent name, of the Father, and of the Son, and of Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages.\" The congregation and choir respond: \"Amen.\"\n\nThe anaphoras currently used by the Syro-Antiochene Rite (or \"West Syriac Rite\") are numerous and the main are:\n\nThe Armenian Rite, used mainly by the Armenian Apostolic Church, uses currently the Anaphora of St. Athanasius.\n\nThe Coptic Church, even if its own rite is the Alexandrian Rite, uses two anaphoras that belong to the literal tradition of the Antiochene rites:\n\nThe Antiochene Maronite Catholic Church is one of the richest if not the richest in the number of anaphoras contained in its Liturgy, most of them belong to the tradition of the Antiochene rites. There are at least seventy-two Maronite Anaphoras.\n\nThe main currently used anaphora of the Alexandrian Rite is the Liturgy of Saint Cyril the Great, which is a revision of the first Alexandrian Liturgy composed by Saint Mark. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church makes use of no less than 14 official anaphoras. Some Ethiopian monasteries use additional Anaphoras as a local practice.\n\nThe more important currently used anaphoras of the East Syriac Rite are the following:\n\nIn some languages, the Anaphora is not distinguished from the Eucharistic Prayer, namely:\n\n"}

{"id": "2183127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183127", "title": "Friedrich Gernsheim", "text": "Friedrich Gernsheim\n\nFriedrich Gernsheim (17 July 1839 – 10 September 1916) was a German composer, conductor and pianist.\n\nGernsheim was born in Worms. He was given his first musical training at home under his mother's care, then starting from the age of seven under Worms' musical director, Louis Liebe, a former pupil of Louis Spohr. His father, a prominent Jewish physician, moved the family to Frankfurt am Main in the aftermath of the year of revolutions, 1848, where he studied with Edward Rosenhain, brother of Jakob Rosenhain. He made his first public appearance as a concert pianist in 1850 and toured for two seasons, then settled with his family in Leipzig, where he studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles from 1852. He spent the years 1855–1860 in Paris, meeting Gioachino Rossini, Théodore Gouvy, Édouard Lalo and Camille Saint-Saëns.\n\nHis travels afterwards took him to Saarbrücken, where in 1861 he took the conductor post vacated by Hermann Levi; to Cologne, where in 1865 Ferdinand Hiller appointed him to the staff of the Conservatory (his pupils there included Engelbert Humperdinck and Carl Lachmund); he then served as musical director of the Philharmonic Society of Rotterdam, 1874-1890. In the latter year he became a teacher at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, and in 1897 moved there to teach at the Prussian Academy of Arts, where he was elected to the senate in 1897. In 1877 he married Helene Hernsheim from Karlsruhe.\n\nGernsheim was a prolific composer, especially of orchestral, chamber and instrumental music, and songs. Some of his works tend to Jewish subject-matter, but Gernsheim rarely made explicit references in his music to Jewish heritage. His third symphony, for example, was based on the legend of the Song of Miriam, but directly inspired by a performance of Handel’s \"Israel in Egypt\". His earlier works show the influence of Schumann, and from 1868, when he first became friendly with Brahms, a Brahmsian influence is very palpable. Gernsheim's four symphonies (the first of which was written before the publication of Brahms' First Symphony) are an interesting example of the reception of Brahmsian style by a sympathetic and talented contemporary. Gernsheim's last works, most notably his \"Zu einem Drama\" (1902), show him moving away from that into something more personal. He died in Berlin.\n\nDue to his Jewish background, his work was banned in Nazi Germany, and his papers and a biography written about him by Karl Holl were removed from music libraries.\n\nAccording to the few who have studied Friedrich Gernsheim’s music, he is usually categorized as a Romantic composer heavily influenced by Johannes Brahms. While he certainly did learn from the great composer, Gernsheim began his composition career prior to hearing Brahms and his influence was only discovered later. Christopher Fifield suggests that Gernsheim owes his “instrumentation, thematic shapes, accompaniments, and orchestral textures” to both Brahms and Max Bruch. In fact, some believe Gernsheim’s symphonic work to resemble Bruch more than Brahms, but homages to both masters are present in his music. Unlike Bruch, however, Gernsheim is described as having his own “personal melodic language” and was more daring in his harmony, whereas Bruch was largely inspired by folk songs.\n\nAfter the premier of Gernsheim’s first symphony, which predated Brahms’s first symphony, Gernsheim’s themes were praised for possessing an “abundance of beautiful details,” many of which pass by the listener unnoticed in the first hearing. The same critic claimed that his treatment of instrumentation “reveals a very talented hand,” and many listeners preferred Gernsheim’s symphonies to those by Brahms. Bruch, for one, considered Gernsheim’s first symphony a work that “ranks without question among the best that has been written in this genre in our time.” He even called Brahms’s symphonies overrated and agreed with critics in that Gernsheim demonstrated a great advantage over those of his contemporaries: “its excellent orchestration.” \n\nOn the other hand, some of Gernsheim’s critics and even his teacher, Ignaz Moscheles, said he fell into the same trap Bruckner did by composing short melodies or themes that were already too complicated to develop further. Granted, some of Gernsheim’s themes can seem fleeting and disconnected since he often inserts short, transitional motives, but he achieves a high degree of contrast between themes through his use of transitions and silence. Moscheles also admitted, after playing Gernsheim’s first piano quartet, that he composed “with great agility in the manner of Schumann” and the Romantic style of the time, but thought his clear motives were often sacrificed to “artificial counterpoint.” Many theorists and music critics today agree with this evaluation of the composer, saying his symphonies and other works tend to be discursive, but all admire his talent in orchestration and achievements in chamber music. In chamber settings, he wrote particularly well for strings and presented his most focused ideas and logical developments. His late orchestral works, such as his fourth symphony and the tone poem \"Zu Einem Drama\", demonstrate the maturity reached in his chamber music but on a larger scale.\n\nThroughout his career, Gernsheim proved himself a somewhat conservative composer and a faithful student of Classical form. He composed under the belief that every measure should be “essential and inevitable,” which is undoubtedly present in his later works. The discursive ideas with small-scale developments that brought him criticism are often used to add variety within traditional structures. His music that follows sonata-allegro form, for example, usually include at least three expositional themes that establish structural patterns and allow him to undermine them. Common threads and relationships can be traced through his many themes, however, and Gernsheim uses them to achieve a certain balance in his music. Alexander Ringer calls this virtue “Gediegenheit,” or “decency and solidarity,” a principle that served as a constant guide in Gernsheim’s musical and personal life.\n\n\nOf these works, the symphonies, the cello concerto, the first cello sonata, the piano trios, two of the piano quartets, the two piano quintets, the violin sonatas, and the second string quartet have been recorded.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2183153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183153", "title": "First Fitna", "text": "First Fitna\n\nThe First Fitna ( \"fitnat maqtal ʻUthmān\" \"strife/sedition of the killing of Uthman\") was a civil war within the Rashidun Caliphate which resulted in the overthrowing of the Rashidun caliphs and the establishment of the Umayyad dynasty. It began when the caliph Uthman was assassinated by rebels in 656 and continued through the four-year reign of Uthman's successor, Ali. It ended in 661 when Ali's heir Hasan ibn Ali concluded a treaty acknowledging the rule of Muawiyah, the first Umayyad caliph.\n\nThe Islamic caliphate expanded very quickly under the first three caliphs. Muawiyah I was appointed Governor of Syria by Umar in 639, after the previous Governor, Muawiyah's elder brother Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, died in a plague along with Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah (the Governor before him) and 25,000 other people.\n\nThe rapid Muslim conquest of the Levant and of Egypt and the consequent Byzantine losses in manpower and territory meant that the Eastern Roman Empire found itself struggling for survival. The Sasanian Empire had already collapsed.\n\nThe Islamic empire expanded at an unprecedented rate, but there was a cost associated with it. Many desert nomads and some bandits living between present-day Iraq and Saudi Arabia also joined in, not out of commitment to Islam but to share the spoils and benefit from the change in the social order, after the defeat of the Sasanian Empire.\n\nBefore Islam, the Roman–Persian Wars and the Byzantine–Sasanian wars had occurred every few years for hundreds of years between 69 BCE and 629 CE. High taxes were imposed on the populations in both the Byzantine and Sassanid empires to finance these wars. There was also continuous bloodshed of the people during these wars. The Arab tribes in Mesopotamia were paid by the Sasanians to act as their mercenaries, while those in Syria were paid likewise by the Byzantines. Each side maintained an Arab satellite state – the Sasanians the Lakhmids, and the Byzantines the Ghassanids – which they used to fight each other in a proxy war. The Syrians and the Mesopotamians had been fighting each other for centuries. Therefore, each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic state to be in their area.\n\nAs Uthman became very old, Marwan I, a relative of Muawiyah I, slipped into the vacuum and became his secretary, slowly assuming more control and relaxing some of these restrictions. Marwan I had previously been excluded from positions of responsibility. \n\nThere was also a movement towards more autonomous tribal groupings, which was particularly strong in Kufa, in Mesopotamia; they wanted to rule their own states. Among them developed a group called the Qurra, which later became known as the Kharijites.\nThe earliest reference to these people are as \"Ahl al-Qurra\", the people of the village, those who fought with Abu Bakr against the desert tribes of Yamama during the Ridda wars when some of the tribes refused to pay the zakat. Afterwards they were granted trusteeship over some of the lands in Sawad in Mesopotamia and were now called \"Ahl al Ayyam\", those who had taken part in the eastern conquests. \nSome modern scholars like R. E. Brunnow trace the origins of the Qurra and the Kharijites back to Bedouin stock and desert tribesmen, who had become soldiers not out of commitment to Islam but to share the spoils. Brunnow held that the Kharijites were Bedouin Arabs or full blooded Arabs.\n\nThe Qurra received the highest stipend of the Muslim army and they had the use of the best lands that they came to regard as their private domain. The Qurra received stipends varying between 2000 and 3000 dirhams, while the majority of the rest of the troops received only 250 to 300 dirhams. The other Ridda tribesmen in Kufa in Mesopotamia, resented the special position given to the Qurra. The tension between the Ridda tribesmen and the Qurra threatened the Qurra's newly acquired prestige. The Qurra therefore felt obliged to defend their position in the new but rapidly changing society.\n\nThe Qurra were mainly based in Kufa. They had not been involved in Syria. Later, when Uthman declined to give them more lands in Persia they felt that their status was being reduced and therefore started to cause trouble. He also removed the distinction between the Ridda and pre-Ridda tribesmen which was not to their liking and lessened their prestige. As a result, they rebelled.\n\nSome of the people with their tribal names as Qurra had been expelled from Kufa, for fomenting trouble and were sent to Muawiyah in Syria.\nThen they were sent to Abd al-Rahman ibn Khalid, who sent them to Uthman in Medina. In Medina they took an oath that they would not cause trouble and following the example of Muhammad, Uthman accepted their word and let them go. They then split up and went to various different Muslim centers and started fomenting rebellion, particularly in Egypt.\n\nThe Qurra then felt that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari could look after their interests better. In 655 the Qurra stopped Uthman's governor Sa'id ibn al-'As at Jara'a, preventing him from entering Kufa and declared Abu Musa al-Ashari to be their governor.\n\nIn 656, the Qurra approached Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, the son of Abu Bakr and the adopted son of Ali and asked him why he was not a governor. They had fought under the service of his father in the Ridda wars. They also asked Uthman's adopted son, Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa, who Uthman had refused to appoint as a governor of any province, why he was not a governor.\n\nAs Muawiyah and Caliph Uthman were preparing to besiege Constantinople, in 656, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr showed some Egyptians the house of Uthman. Finding the gate of Uthman's house strongly guarded by his supporters, the Qurra climbed the back wall and sneaked inside, leaving the guards on the gate unaware of what was going on inside. Hassan and Hussein were also guarding Uthman at the time. The rebels entered his room and struck him on the head.\n\nUthman had been besieged in his palace for 49 days before he was killed. Ali had done a great deal to attempt to save Uthman; however, Marwan prevented Ali from being able to help Uthman. Uthman only listened to the advice of Marwan and Saeed bin Aas, and Marwan did his best to act as a barrier between Ali and Uthman.\n\nUthman's death had a polarizing effect in the Muslim world at the time. Questions were raised not only regarding his character and policies but also about the relationship between Muslims and the state, religious beliefs regarding rebellion and governance, and the qualifications of rulership in Islam.\n\nThe people of Medina asked Ali, who had been chief judge in Medina, to become the Caliph and he accepted.\n\nMuawiyah I, the governor of Syria, a relative of Uthman, and Marwan I wanted the murderers of Uthman arrested, and blamed Ali for it, Ali claimed that he was not responsible for Uthman's murder, but the conspirators continued the conspiracies. The conspirators felt that if there was peace, they would be arrested for the killing of Uthman. Many of them later became the Kharijites and eventually killed Ali.\n\nAisha bint Abu Bakr (Muhammad's widow), Talhah ibn Ubayd-Allah, and Zubayr ibn al-Awam opposed Ali's succession and gathered in Mecca calling for vengeance against Uthman's killers and election of new caliph through Shura. Later they moved to Basra taking it from Ali's governor, with the intention of strengthening their numbers. Ali in response sent his son Hasan and the leaders of Kufan mutineers to raise an army in Kufa. Ali himself followed them soon; with the combined army, they marched against Basra.\n\nThe armies met outside Basra. After three days of failed negotiations, battle started in the afternoon of 8 December 656 and lasted till the evening. Zubayr left the field without fighting but was pursued and killed. Ali's army emerged victorious and Talha was also killed. After admonishing Ayesha, Ali sent her back to Medina, escorted by her brother Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. Marwan probably paid allegiance to Ali and the latter let him go.\n\nAli's inability to punish the murderers of Uthman and Muawiyah's refusal to pledge allegiance eventually led Ali to move his army north to confront Muawiyah. The two armies encamped themselves at Siffin for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Neither side wanted to fight. Then on 29 July 657 (11th Safar), the Mesopotamians under Ashtar's command, the Qurra in Ali's army, who had their own camp, started the fighting in earnest. The battle lasted three days. The loss of life was terrible. Suddenly one of the Syrians, Ibn Lahiya, out of fear of further civil war and unable to bear the spectacle rode forward with a copy of the Quran on the ears of his horse to call for judgement by the book of Allah, and the other Syrians followed suit. Everyone on both sides took up the cry, eager to avoid killing their fellow Muslims - except for the conspirators. The majority of Ali's followers supported arbitration. Nasr b Muzahim, in one of the earliest sources states that al-Ashath ibn Qays, one of Ali's key supporters and a Kufan, then stood up and said:\n\nO company of Muslims! You have seen what happened in the day which has passed. In it some of the Arabs have been annihilated. By Allah, I have reached the age which Allah willed that I reach. but I have never ever seen a day like this. Let the present convey to the absent! If we fight tomorrow, it will be the annihilation of the Arabs and the loss of what is sacred. I do not make this statement out of fear of death, but I am an aged man who fears for the women and children tomorrow if we are annihilated. O Allah, I have looked to my people and the people of my deen and not empowered anyone. There is no success except by Allah. On Him I rely and to Him I return. Opinion can be both right and wrong. When Allah decides a matter, He carries it out whether His servants like it or not. I say this and I ask Allah's forgiveness for me and you. \n\nThen, Nasr b Muzahim says people looked at Muawiya who said \n\nHe is right, by the Lord. If we meet tomorrow the Byzantines will attack our women and children and the people of Persia will attack the women and children of Mesopotamia. Those with forebearance and intelligence see this. Tie the copies of the Quran to the ends of the spears. \n\nSo the fighting stopped.\n\nEvery time Ali tried to negotiate the Qurra and the Sabait started wars and launched night attacks, fearing that if there was peace, then they will be arrested.\n\nIt was decided that the Syrians and the residents of Kufa should nominate an arbitrator, each to decide between 'Ali and Mu'awiya. The Syrians' choice fell on 'Amr bin al-A'as who was the rational soul and spokesman of Muawiya. 'Amr ibn al-'As was one of the generals involved in conquering Syria and also Egypt. A few years earlier 'Amr ibn al-'As with 9,000 men in Palestine had found himself confronting Heraclius' 100,000 army until Khalid crossed the Syrian desert from Mesopotamia to assist him. He was a highly skilled negotiator and had previously been used in negotiations with the Heraclius the Roman Emperor. Ali wanted Malik Ashtar or Abdullah bin 'Abbas to be appointed as an arbitrator for the people of Kufa, but the Qurra strongly demurred, alleging that men like these two were responsible for the war and, therefore, ineligible for that office of trust. They nominated Abu Musa al-Ash'ari as their arbitrator (during the time of 'Uthman, they had appointed Abu Musa al-Ash'ari as the Governor of Kufa and removed 'Uthman's governor before they started fighting 'Uthman). Ali found it expedient to agree to this choice in order to ward off bloody dissension in his army. According to \"Usd al-G̲h̲āba\", Ali therefore took care to personally explain to the arbitrators, \"You are arbiters on condition that you decide according to the Book of God, and if you are not so inclined you should not deem yourselves to be arbiters.\"\n\nWhen the arbitrators assembled at Dumat al-Jandal, which lay midway between Kufa and Syria and had for that reason been selected as the place for the announcement of the decision, a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss the matters in hand. When the time arrived for taking a decision about the caliphate, Amr bin al-A'as convinced Abu Musa al-Ashari that they should deprive both Ali and Mu'awiya of the caliphate, and give the Muslims the right to elect the caliph. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari decided to act accordingly. As the time for announcing the verdict approached, the people belonging to both parties assembled. 'Amr bin al-A'as requested Abu Musa take the lead in announcing the decision he favoured. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari agreed to open the proceedings, and said, \"We have devised a solution after a good deal of thought and it may put an end to all contention and separatist tendencies. It is this. Both of us remove 'Ali as well as Mu'awiya from the caliphate. The Muslims are given the right to elect a caliph as they think best.\" On his turn 'Amr bin al-A'as stated that he agreed with the part of Abu Musa Ash'ari's verdict that 'Ali should be deposed but he himself was in favour of retaining Mua'wiyah on his post.\n\nAli refused to accept the verdict. This put Ali in a weak position even amongst his own supporters. The most vociferous opponents of Ali in his camp were the very same people who had forced Ali to appoint their arbitrator, the Qurra. Feeling that Ali could no longer look after their interests and that they could be arrested for the murder of 'Uthman if there were peace, they broke away from Ali's force, rallying under the slogan, \"arbitration belongs to God alone.\" The Qurra then became known as the Kharijites (\"those who leave\").\n\nIn 659 Ali's forces finally moved against the Kharijites and they finally met in the Battle of Nahrawan. Although Ali won the battle, the constant conflict had begun to affect his standing. Tom Holland writes \"Ali won a victory over them as crushing as it was to prove pyrrhic: for all he had done, in effect was to fertilise the soil of Mesopotamia with the blood of their martyrs. Three years later, and there came the inevitable blowback: a Kharijite assassin.\"\n\nWhile dealing with the Iraqis, Ali found it hard to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions to exert control over his areas and as a result later spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites. As a result, on the Eastern front, Ali found it hard to expand the state.\n\nAli was assassinated by Kharijites in 661. On the 19th of Ramadan, while Praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa, Ali was attacked by the Kharijite Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam. He was wounded by ibn Muljam's poison-coated sword while prostrating in the Fajr prayer. When Alī was assassinated, Muawiyah had the largest and the most organized and disciplined force in the Muslim Empire.\n\nSix months later in 661, in the interest of peace, Hasan ibn Ali made a peace treaty with Muawiyah. By now Hassan only ruled the area around Kufa. In the Hasan-Muawiya treaty, Hasan ibn Ali handed over power to Muawiya on the condition that he be just to the people and keep them safe and secure and after his death he does not establish a dynasty.\n\nIn the year 661, Muawiyah was crowned as caliph at a ceremony in Jerusalem. Ali's caliphate had lasted for four years. After the treaty with Hassan, Muawiyah ruled for nearly 20 years most of which were spent expanding the state.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Fellowship brought together many independent churches and mission halls, which had been somewhat isolated.\n\nThe FIEC is in the Independent tradition. According to the National Director of FIEC, \"An ‘Independent’ church is self-governing. Each individual local church has ultimate control over its own affairs. It does not belong to any external body or institution which has control over it.\" The FIEC leadership claims it exercises 'something comparable to the sub-apostolic' ministry of Timothy and Titus. Some trace the routes of Independency to separatists, such as Robert Browne in the time of Elizabeth I and James I of England, but \"separatism\" may be an unhelpful term to use in the present day to describe FIEC, because although a church has to be autonomous and self-governing to affiliate to the FIEC, one of the main purposes of the FIEC is that local churches should work together to share resources as they seek to advance the Christian Faith. However, it is correct to note that a number of churches joined FIEC when they separated from a denomination that moved away from what they considered to be historic orthodox biblical Christianity. For example, Westminster Chapel, a leading church in the Independent tradition, joined the FIEC when the Congregational Union merged with the English Presbyterian Church to form the United Reformed Church denomination (URC). Many Independent churches within the FIEC are Baptist churches but the FIEC is open both to churches that only baptise adults and also to churches that baptise the children of believers.\n\nFormer Presidents include Rev. Theodore Harold Bendor-Samuel (1967, 1978).\n\nFIEC Limited is a registered charity and trust corporation working under the title FIEC Practical Services. It holds church property in trust for many churches and also provides legal advice to churches and other charities. In most cases where it holds property in trust for churches, its role is limited to acting in accordance with the lawful instructions of the church for which it holds the property, although in some cases, it does also have decision making powers concerning the use of the property.\n\nThe FIEC has been very active in church planting over recent years and has a number of resources available to help churches and individuals considering starting a new church.\n\nThe \"Go Into\" project from the FIEC highlights 50 places across Great Britain with little or no evangelical witness relative to population size to help those thinking about starting a new church.\n\nThe FIEC is led by a team of directors. The senior director is the National Director, John Stevens. Other directors are Adrian Reynolds (Training), Andy Patterson (Mission), Johnny Prime (Pastoral), Andy Hunter (Scotland), Gemma Adam (Practical Services) and Trevor Archer (London).\n\nFIEC is the largest corporate partner of Affinity, which was previously called the British Evangelical Council.\n\nThey also believe that Ecumenism in the form of Churches Together is not a positive move, citing various reasons including the liberal stance of other churches. The Trust Board has recently affirmed that formal membership of Churches Together (CT) is inconsistent with the FIEC Statement on Ecumenism.

She is known for her portrayal of Amanda Young in the \"Saw\" franchise and for starring as Linda in the CBS sitcom \"Becker\" (1998–2004). She co-starred as Jennifer Goodson, the ex-wife of Charlie Goodson (Charlie Sheen), on the FX sitcom \"Anger Management\" (2012–2014).\nIn addition to acting, Smith once fronted the rock band Fydolla Ho, with which she toured globally. Later, with actor Missi Pyle, she served as half of Smith & Pyle, a country rock band.\n\nSmith was born at Orangeburg Regional Hospital in Orangeburg, South Carolina. She is the second child of Patricia Ann (née Smoak), an oncology nurse, and James H. Smith, a financial planner and former US Air Force pilot. When she was one year old, her family relocated from South Carolina to Van Nuys, California. Her parents divorced when she was two years old, and her mother remarried when she was eight years old. She attended Ranchito Avenue Elementary School in Panorama City, Los Angeles and Madison Jr. High in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. She then attended North Hollywood High School, graduating in 1987.\n\nSmith began acting as a child appearing on stage in \"A Christmas Carol\" repertory from ages eight to 11 and starred in a stage play with Richard Dreyfuss at age 15. She performed in the original stage production of \"To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday\" and won the Dramalogue Critics Award for her performance, becoming the youngest actor up to that time to receive such an honor. She made her television debut in a McDonald's commercial titled \"Best Friends\" in 1978.\n\nShe joined the Screen Actors Guild at age nine and made her feature film debut in John Huston's 1982 adaptation of the Broadway musical \"Annie\", as one of Aileen Quinn's fellow orphans. In 1985, she co-starred in two melodramas, \"Not My Kid\" and \"Crime of Innocence\", along with a small role in Iron Eagle (1986).\n\nIn 1987, Smith co-starred in \"Summer School\" as pregnant student Rhonda Altobello. The following year, she starred in a 1988 remake of the Steve McQueen classic \"The Blob\". \n\nSmith played a rich teen who helps John Candy locate her kidnapped sister in the 1989 film \"Who's Harry Crumb?\" That same year, she co-starred with Jennie Garth and Barbara Eden in the short-lived TV series \"Brand New Life\". The following year, she co-starred in the remake of Michael Cimino's thriller \"Desperate Hours\". She then took a three year break from acting in the early 1990s, primarily because she had outgrown teenage roles and had a hard time finding work. In 1994 she appeared in the TV miniseries, \"The Stand\". She finally landed a small role in the film \"Leaving Las Vegas\" and has had steady work ever since.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2004, Smith co-starred as Linda in \"Becker\". She also played Julie Lawry in the 1994 miniseries \"The Stand\", based on the novel by Stephen King. She made several guest appearances on such television shows as \"Cagney & Lacey\", \"Murder, She Wrote\", \"The X-Files\", \"Players\", and \"\". In 2003, she lent her voice to an episode of the Disney cartoon \"Kim Possible\" as Vivian Porter.\n\nSmith has become well known in recent years for her role as Amanda Young in the \"Saw\" films. She has been called a \"scream queen\" due to the number of horror films in which she has appeared.\n\nIn the DVD commentary of \"Saw\", the producers revealed that her scenes were filmed while she was battling a terrible case of the flu. It was revealed in the DVD commentary of \"Saw II\" that she was four months pregnant with her second child during filming. Her pregnancy was kept a secret from everyone except director Darren Lynn Bousman. He mentioned in the commentary that Smith's daughter Verve accidentally told him about the pregnancy during filming. She has said that although she is briefly shown in \"Saw IV\" and \"Saw V\", she was never on set. Any scenes featuring her were dubbed from file footage. On March 20, 2009, producer Mark Burg released a statement confirming that Smith would be in \"Saw VI\". She arrived in Toronto on March 31, 2009, to begin filming new flashback sequences.\n\nSmith admitted she has a hard time watching the \"Saw\" films, or horror movies in general. She originally turned the role of Amanda Young down because it was very upsetting to her. After turning the role down, she was shown the eight-minute short film by Leigh Whannell and James Wan and changed her mind after the role was offered to her a second time.\n\nIn 2006, Smith made an appearance in the ten-minute short film trailer \"Repo! The Genetic Opera\", also directed by Bousman. Smith's character was Heather Sweet, the surgery addicted daughter of GeneCo president Rotti Largo. The trailer was filmed in Toronto, Ontario and was an adaptation from the stage version. Bousman filmed the trailer after completing \"Saw III\" to try to pitch the idea to film producers. Smith did not reprise her role as Heather Sweet when Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures picked up the film in 2007; she was replaced by Paris Hilton. \n\nIn 2008, Smith played Detective Gina Harcourt in the FEARnet original series \"\". The series premiered on July 17, 2008, on FEARnet.com in six webisodes along with behind the scenes clips. This series is a continuation of the first webisode series \"\". She made her producing debut with this series.\n\nSmith was the host and one of three mentors on the VH1 reality program \"Scream Queens\" which aired from October 20, 2008, to December 8, 2008. In January 2010 it was announced that Smith would not be returning as host and mentor for Season 2 due to scheduling conflicts. She was replaced by Jaime King.\n\nIn 2009, Smith played the role of Dr. Sullivan, child psychiatrist in the third installment of \"The Grudge\" trilogy, \"The Grudge 3\". The film was a direct-to-DVD release on May 12, 2009. She appeared as a guest star on \"The Secret Life of the American Teenager\" on August 30, 2010.

She contributed to the soundtrack of \"Saw III\" with vocals on Hydrovibe's song \"Killer Inside\" and to the soundtrack for \"Catacombs\" as a solo vocalist with the song \"Please Myself.\" Her voice was also featured in the film \"Carnival of Souls\" where her character Sandra performed a jazz song titled \"I Fear\". \n\nSmith fronted the punk/metal band Fydolla Ho (With 'Fydolla' coming from the Chris Rock character from \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka (1988)) in the early 2000s. The group was originally formed by Smith, Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, Suicidal Tendencies guitarist Rick Battson, and Skindred vocalist Benji Webbe as a small recording project. The band released their debut full-length album, \"Untied\", in December 2001. She balanced the band with being a regular cast member on \"Becker\". The band officially ended in 2004.\n\nSmith began working on a solo album in 2004 with producer Chris Goss, but the project was never completed. In an interview with Radio Free in October 2005 she stated, \"between being a mom, and working, and growing another baby, I have not had time to give attention to music for a while.\"\n\nShe was part of a country rock music group with actress Missi Pyle called Smith & Pyle. The two actresses met while filming an ABC comedy pilot titled \"Traveling in Packs\". The band started after Smith invited Pyle to join her in attending the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The duo formed a band. Their first album, \"It's OK to Be Happy\", was released digitally through iTunes and Amazon.com in July 2008. The debut album was recorded in Joshua Tree, California and produced by Chris Goss. Smith and Pyle became business partners and formed their own record label, called Urban Prairie Records. The two disbanded in 2011 before a second album was completed. While promoting \"Anger Management\" in 2013, she stated that she reached a point where she wanted to focus on her children and television work.\n\nSmith has two children: a daughter from her marriage to photographer Jason Reposar (1998–2003), and a son from her brief marriage to musician Kai Mattoon (2005–2006). Her two children were featured in the debut Smith & Pyle album, \"It's OK to Be Happy.\" The children are listed in the album credits as having vocals and spoken narrative tracks for two songs.\n\nSmith and Reposar eloped in 1998 while on vacation in Scotland. The song \"Sugar,\" performed by Smith & Pyle, was written by Smith after her divorce from Reposar. She describes it as her breakup song, saying that it is quite different from Pyle's breakup song, \"I Wish You Were Dead\".\n\nSmith is a convert from Lutheranism to Eastern Orthodoxy and in 2014 stated that she was thinking of making a documentary about her conversion and other aspects of Orthodoxy, which she planned to call \"Orthodoxy: A Love Story\"; as of March 2020 no such documentary exists and no recent updates have been provided.\n\nSmith was featured in \"Maxim\" magazine in June 2001. In 2013, after her religious conversion to Orthodox Christianity, Smith expressed regret about the two Maxim photo shoots and guessed that 80% of her presence on the Internet comes from those two shoots alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its original application in physics was as a model for the velocity of a massive Brownian particle under the influence of friction. It is named after Leonard Ornstein and George Eugene Uhlenbeck.\n\nThe Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is a stationary Gauss–Markov process, which means that it is a Gaussian process, a Markov process, and is temporally homogeneous. In fact, it is the only nontrivial process that satisfies these three conditions, up to allowing linear transformations of the space and time variables. Over time, the process tends to drift towards its mean function: such a process is called mean-reverting.\n\nThe process can be considered to be a modification of the random walk in continuous time, or Wiener process, in which the properties of the process have been changed so that there is a tendency of the walk to move back towards a central location, with a greater attraction when the process is further away from the center. The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process can also be considered as the continuous-time analogue of the discrete-time AR(1) process.\n\nThe Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process formula_1 is defined by the following stochastic differential equation:\n\nwhere formula_3 and formula_4 are parameters and formula_5 denotes the Wiener process.\n\nAn additional drift term is sometimes added:\n\nwhere formula_7 is a constant. In financial mathematics, this is also known as the Vasicek model.\n\nThe Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is sometimes also written as a Langevin equation of the form\nwhere formula_9, also known as white noise, stands in for the supposed derivative formula_10 of the Wiener process. However, formula_10 does not exist because the Wiener process is nowhere differentiable, and so the Langevin equation is, strictly speaking, only heuristic. In physics and engineering disciplines, it is nevertheless a common representation for the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and similar stochastic differential equations.\n\nThe Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process can also be described in terms of a probability density function, formula_12, which specifies the probability of finding the process in the state formula_13 at time formula_14. This function satisfies the Fokker–Planck equation\n\nwhere formula_16. This is a linear parabolic partial differential equation which can be solved by a variety of techniques. The transition probability formula_17 is a Gaussian with mean formula_18 and variance formula_19:\n\nThis gives the probability of the state formula_13 occurring at time formula_14 given initial state formula_23 at time formula_24. Equivalently, formula_17 is the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with initial condition formula_26.\n\nAssuming formula_27 is constant, the mean is\nand the covariance is\n\nThe Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is an example of a Gaussian process that has a bounded variance and admits a stationary probability distribution, in contrast to the Wiener process; the difference between the two is in their \"drift\" term. For the Wiener process the drift term is constant, whereas for the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process it is dependent on the current value of the process: if the current value of the process is less than the (long-term) mean, the drift will be positive; if the current value of the process is greater than the (long-term) mean, the drift will be negative. In other words, the mean acts as an equilibrium level for the process. This gives the process its informative name, \"mean-reverting.\" \n\nA temporally homogeneous Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process can be represented as a scaled, time-transformed Wiener process:\nwhere formula_5 is the standard Wiener process. Equivalently, with the change of variable formula_32 this becomes\n\nUsing this mapping, one can translate known properties of formula_5 into corresponding statements for formula_1. For instance, the law of the iterated logarithm for formula_5 becomes\n\nThe stochastic differential equation for formula_1 can be formally solved by variation of parameters. Writing\n\nwe get\n\nIntegrating from formula_41 to formula_14 we get\n\nwhereupon we see\n\nFrom this representation, the first moment (i.e. the mean) is shown to be\n\nassuming formula_27 is constant. Moreover, the Itō isometry can be used to calculate the covariance function by\n\nBy using discretely sampled data at time intervals of width formula_14, the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process are asymptotically normal to their true values. More precisely,\n\nformula_49\n\nThe Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process can be interpreted as a scaling limit of a discrete process, in the same way that Brownian motion is a scaling limit of random walks. Consider an urn containing formula_50 blue and yellow balls. At each step a ball is chosen at random and replaced by a ball of the opposite colour. Let formula_51 be the number of blue balls in the urn after formula_50 steps. Then formula_53 converges in law to an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process as formula_50 tends to infinity.\n\nThe Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is a prototype of a noisy relaxation process.\nConsider for example a Hookean spring with spring constant formula_55 whose dynamics is highly overdamped\nwith friction coefficient formula_56.\nIn the presence of thermal fluctuations with temperature formula_57, the length formula_58\nof the spring will fluctuate stochastically around the spring rest length formula_27;\nits stochastic dynamic is described by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with:\n\nwhere formula_61 is derived from the Stokes–Einstein equation formula_62 for the effective diffusion constant.\n\nIn physical sciences, the stochastic differential equation of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is rewritten as a Langevin equation\nwhere formula_64 is white Gaussian noise with\nformula_65\nFluctuations are correlated as \nwith correlation time formula_67.\n\nAt equilibrium, the spring stores an average energy formula_68 in accordance with the equipartition theorem.\n\nThe Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is one of several approaches used to model (with modifications) interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices stochastically. The parameter formula_7 represents the equilibrium or mean value supported by fundamentals; formula_61 the degree of volatility around it caused by shocks, and formula_71 the rate by which these shocks dissipate and the variable reverts towards the mean. One application of the process is a trading strategy known as pairs trade.\n\nThe Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process has been proposed as an improvement over a Brownian motion model for modeling the change in organismal phenotypes over time. A Brownian motion model implies that the phenotype can move without limit, whereas for most phenotypes natural selection imposes a cost for moving too far in either direction.\n\nIt is possible to extend Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes to processes where the background driving process is a Lévy process (instead of a simple Brownian motion). These processes are widely studied by Ole Barndorff-Nielsen and Neil Shephard, and others.\n\nIn addition, in finance, stochastic processes are used where the volatility increases for larger\nvalues of formula_72. In particular, the CKLS (Chan–Karolyi–Longstaff–Sanders) process with the volatility term replaced by formula_73 can be solved in closed form for formula_74, as well as for formula_75, which corresponds to the conventional OU process. Another special case is formula_76, which corresponds to the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model (CIR-model).\n\nA multi-dimensional version of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, denoted by the \"N\"-dimensional vector formula_77, can be defined from\n\nwhere formula_79 is an \"N\"-dimensional Wiener process, and formula_80 and formula_81 are constant \"N\"×\"N\" matrices. The solution is\n\nand the mean is\n\nNote that these expressions make use of the matrix exponential.\n\nThe process can also be described in terms of the probability density function formula_84, which satisfies the Fokker–Planck equation\n\nwhere the matrix formula_86 with components formula_87 is defined by formula_88. As for the 1d case, the process is a linear transformation of Gaussian random variables, and therefore itself must be Gaussian. Because of this, the transition probability formula_89 is a Gaussian which can be written down explicitly. If the real parts of the eigenvalues of formula_80 are larger than zero, a stationary solution formula_91 moreover exists, given by\n\nwhere the matrix formula_93 is determined from formula_94.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2183188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183188", "title": "Sauk River (Minnesota)", "text": "Sauk River (Minnesota)\n\nThe Sauk River is a tributary of the Mississippi River in central Minnesota in the United States. It drains small lakes in Stearns County. In the Ojibwe language it is called \"Ozaagi-ziibi\", meaning \"River of the Sauks\".\n\nIt issues from Lake Osakis on the Todd County line and flows east through Guernsey Lake, Little Sauk Lake and Juergens Lake, then south through Sauk Lake and past Sauk Centre, southeast past Melrose and Richmond, then northeast through Cedar Island Lake and Zumwalde Lake, past Cold Spring and Waite Park to the Mississippi River north of St. Cloud.\n\nAt St. Cloud, MN, the river has a mean annual discharge of 342 cubic feet per second.\n\nThe rapids that occur south of the river's mouth on the Mississippi River lent their name to the nearby city of Sauk Rapids.\n\nIn 1847, the Mississippi Chippewa ceded their lands about the Sauk River to the United States for the purpose of establishing a homeland for the Winnebagoes, who at the time were being removed out of Wisconsin. However, due to continued skirmishes between the Ojibwe (Chippewa) and the Dakota, the Winnebagoes were placed in constant danger. By their request, the United States relocated the Winnebagoes to south-central Minnesota, then to South Dakota and finally Nebraska. Some of the Winnebagoes, however, returned to Wisconsin despite their removal.\n\nThe river is named after the Sauk tribe, also called the Sac or Meskwaki, some of whom had come to the area (mostly settled by Sioux or Chippewa) after the Black Hawk War; this tribe now has concentrations in Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The wars between the Sioux and the Chippewa, spurred on by the French fur traders who often sided with the Chippewa, resulted in the establishment of a common hunting grounds to divert conflict between the tribes. This somewhat unsuccessful \"neutral\" area was bordered by the Crow River on the south and the Sauk on the north. Early interventions by the white man marked the ensuing decline of Indian populations in this area.\n\nThe fur traders were the first Europeans into this area, representatives of both the Hudson's Bay Company and French interests, pursuing the fur trade as early as the late 18th century. Abundant beaver and other fur types were paramount to these fur traders. The development of the Red River Valley and points in between Minneapolis – St. Paul and Winnipeg provided the first push for settlement in the area. By the late 1850s numerous settlements started to develop along the Sauk River and adjacent areas. The Red River Trails required various fording points across the river, and some of these sites are still visible today upon close inspection. Waite's Crossing near the Knights of Columbus Park in St. Cloud is marked by a commemorative stone explaining the existence of an important crossing at this point.\n\nAs increased settlement took place, fur trading took a backseat to agriculture and the logging industry that were becoming more important for the region. Logging of the hardwood forests soon became a vital interest, and the Sauk River provided a corridor for the passage of wood from western and central Stearns County to the rapidly developing St Cloud area. The granite industry likewise flourished with this growth, and the numerous granite outcrops along the river as well as many other sites in the county were obvious targets for exploitation of this resource. Prominent evidences of this industry still exist today along the Sauk as well as in the \"Granite City\" of St. Cloud.\n\nThroughout this time, the development of a substantial agricultural economy provided for the development of mills along the Sauk. The river provided another resource to the area in this manner. With the advancement of railroads to the area, the small mills along the river declined in usefulness; however, evidence of these sites exist today along the river, with a large mill still operating where the Sauk enters the Mississippi.\n\nThe Sauk enters the Mississippi River on the north end of St. Cloud, just above the Sauk Rapids of the Mississippi. Numerous waterfowl can be seen in state-managed wildlife areas as the river winds along this section. The river then begins to broaden its banks and deepen its valleys as its course continues. Midway along its path, near Richmond, the river forms a \"Chain of Lakes\" where more than 80 miles of continuous shoreline are encountered over a river length of less than 8 miles. As the river continues, a variety of granite outcrops and small hills provide a scenic landscape along the shores. Near St Cloud, the river gradient increases and a series of rapids occur until the river joins with the Mississippi.\n\nA variety of plant life is found along the Sauk River, ranging from naturally restored prairie grasslands to thick hardwood forests. The river starts in flat swamp vegetation with flora common to most Minnesota wetlands. Prairie-type grasses and flowers are then encountered on the banks and fields above the river. Near the Spring Hill County Park, a naturally restored prairie field is preserved. Oaks, elms, silver maples and willows are the most common trees through most of the valley. One of the most interesting sights along the Sauk is an elevated tamarack bog on the north bank of the river near Rockville, providing beautiful golden scenery in the fall.\n\nAbundant waterfowl are found in and around two state managed wildlife areas south of Sauk Centre. The marshy swampland that borders the river is prime habitat for a variety of waterfowl. Early in the morning, it is possible to see deer feeding along the river in some wooded areas. Gray fox, red squirrels, and chipmunks are common in the wooded sections, along with an occasional woodchuck, muskrat, or beaver. There have been sightings of such less common animals as otter and mink.\n\nA variety of birdlife in the Sauk Valley makes for very interesting bird watching. The forests and grasslands are home to most of the birds native to central Minnesota. Cardinals, woodpeckers and many songbirds are common. Grouse, pheasant and partridge are some of the more popular gamebirds found near the Sauk. Birds of prey such as various hawks, owls and an occasional bald eagle can also be seen when canoeing the river. Along most of the river it is common to see great blue herons.\n\nBecause of the shallow depth of the river and the somewhat poor water quality, game fish are not abundant in the Sauk River. Redhorse and sucker are found in most parts of the river. However, in the \"Chain of Lakes\" area, fishing is very popular with a variety of fish being caught. Panfish, walleye and northern are the most common to anglers in this area. Walleye and northern can also be found where the river enters the Mississippi. The world record Greater redhorse was caught in the Sauk in 2005.\n\nIn June, 2011 Todd Foster and Scott Miller paddled the entire length of the Sauk River. The trip was made to chronicle fences along the river, as well as to highlight the Friends of the Sauk River canoe library, and to promote getting outside and paddling the river. Their trip was chronicled at http://paddlethesauk.weebly.com\n\n\n"}

The cause is believed to be genetic. Nearly 10 percent of pet African pygmy hedgehogs are affected, due to their limited bloodlines.\n\nThe disease slowly degrades the hedgehog's muscle control. This first appears as a wobble while the hedgehog is attempting to stand still. Over time, the hedgehog will lose control of all muscles from the rear of its body to the front. A tentative diagnosis can be based purely on the clinical signs, but definitive diagnosis is only possible from post-mortem examination of spinal cord and brain tissues.\n\nThe hedgehog's health will deteriorate over the course of weeks or months, and in the advanced stages of this disease, they become completely immobilized, making euthanasia a recommended consideration. Most animals die within two years of diagnosis.\n\nSymptoms usually begin in hedgehogs before they reach two years old, but can occur at any age. \n\nThere is no known cure for WHS, which has been compared to human multiple sclerosis. Various vitamin supplements, antibiotic and steroid treatments have been used; some appear to temporarily improve the signs or slow the progression of the disease, but as signs of WHS wax and wane, it is difficult to assess the benefit of treatments. No treatment has been shown to prevent the progression of paralysis.\n"}

It lies about a mile (2 km) to the west of Swansea city centre, and falls within the Uplands electoral ward. It is centred on the A4118 road, which links Swansea city centre and Sketty. The main road begins as Walter Road from the east, and becomes Sketty Road towards the west. Much of the area is hilly. The population of the community and ward in 2011 was 15,665 and in terms of Welsh identity had the lowest percentage in the county. \n\nUplands' main shopping area is located on and around Uplands Crescent, where small businesses mix with fast-food outlets and high-street heavyweights like Boots, Sainsbury's and Tesco. The western side of Bryn-y-Mor Road also has a number of convenience stores, hairdressers, fashion boutiques, pubs and restaurants.\n\nThe area is becoming increasingly known amongst the people of Swansea for its night-life, with a number of late-night bars and restaurants having opened their doors during the early 2010s, which, along with a diverse range of independent shops and a monthly local produce market in Gwydr Square, put Uplands in TravelSupermarket’s top 20 UK Hip Hang-outs in 2017. The Uplands Tavern pub however, has long been a popular venue, and was once frequented by Sir Kingsley Amis and Dylan Thomas, although the two writers were not residents of Uplands at the same time. The latter's childhood home on Cwmdonkin Drive has a blue plaque marking his birthplace. In 2012 the annual Do Not Go Gentle Festival was launched, hosting live music and literature across various venues, it aims to be \"a festival Dylan Thomas might have liked\".\n\nUplands is a relatively salubrious area of Swansea, with property prices above the national average. Council tax rates are quite high because of this, falling into band C and above. The housing stock consists of fairly large properties; three-storey properties and properties containing four bedrooms or more are common. Many of the larger properties have been converted into student houses, making the Uplands area popular amongst students attending the city's two universities.\n\nThough a community (civil parish) of Swansea, Uplands doesn't elect a community council.\n\nEaton Crescent, considered to be one of the most upmarket residential areas close to Swansea's city centre, is where Conservative politician Michael Heseltine grew up. The crescent consists mainly of large three-storey semi-detached and terraced 4-6 bedroom town-houses. During the late 1980s, a large number of properties were converted for use as student houses, but since the late 1990s it has mainly returned to housing families.\n\nStella Maris is a convent occupied by the Sisters of Ursulines of Jesus on Eaton Crescent. The sisters once ran the Stella Maris Primary School, a former independent convent school that is now closed.\n\nSt. James' Church, located on Walter Road, was opened in 1867 as a chapel of ease for the nearby St. Mary's in Swansea's town centre. It became a separate parish in 1985. There is a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall on the corner of Walter Road and Mirador Crescent, and the Dharmavajra Kadampa Buddhist Centre is located in Springfield House on Ffynone Road. The Mansion House, the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Swansea, is also on Ffynone Road.\n\nThe Llwyn-Y-Bryn campus of Gower College Swansea is located just off Walter Road. There are two private schools in the area; Oakleigh House provides primary education and Ffynone House provides senior education for GCSE and A-Level pupils.\n\nLocal parks are Cwmdonkin Park, Rosehill Quarry Community Park, and Brynmill Park, with the former an important location and source of inspiration for Dylan Thomas, who lived so close to the park during his childhood that \"\"on summer evenings I could listen, in my bed, to the voices of other children playing ball\"\". Cwmdonkin Park features heavily in the radio broadcasts 'Return Journey' and 'Reminiscences of Childhood' and, most famously, the poem 'The hunchback in the park'. A memorial stone with lines from another of Thomas' poems, 'Fern Hill', was placed in the park in 1963.\n\n\n\n"}

Chau's popularity has spread throughout Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mainland China, and parts of Southeast Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam). As of August 2007, he has released more than 40 albums and held several international concert tours.\n\nWakin Chau was born in a rice store owned by his family at Sai Ying Pun in then-British colony of Hong Kong. Growing up as the fourth son in his seven-member family, Wakin learned to play the guitar when he was about 13 years old. In 1979, he left for Taipei to major in mathematics at National Taiwan University. During his college years, he sang and played folk songs in local coffee shops. This activity was a tradition among NTU students, and it is how Wakin learned to sing in Mandarin, which would be key to his future as a music-maker in Taiwan.\n\nWakin had high hopes to establish a career as a recording artist, and he actively sought out contacts in the music industry. But a persistent lack of interest eventually led him to give up trying to become a performer – instead, he could sign on as an assistant producer at Rock Records, where he wrote marketable pop songs for other artists.\n\nWakin was later encouraged by Chyi Yu to sing some jingles for commercial advertising spots. One of these tunes was for a car commercial, and it happened to catch the attention of Wakin's boss at Rock, who realised it was the voice of his own assistant producer.\n\nThat moment opened the door for Wakin to record and release his first Mandarin album under the Rock Records label in 1987. For a man who had dreamed of performing professionally but had settled on being a record producer, this was a period of particularly good fortune that launched a succession of chart-topping records.\n\nShortly before his music career took off, Wakin the record producer met an American girl named Constance Woods, whose father was in Taiwan as a Fulbright scholar. Seeming to have plenty in common (including birthdays only one day apart) Wakin and Constance began to date, got engaged and then on 16 November 1986, they married in Taipei. Four months later there was another ceremony with family and friends in the United States of America on 14 March 1987. They have a son named Andrew and a daughter named Anya.\n\nFrom 1985, Emil Chau, who has been using his given name Wakin since 1999, has released more than 40 albums in Mandarin, Cantonese and English. He has become a prominent name in the music of Taiwan and has fans of all ages not only around Asia but also in North America, Europe and elsewhere. His platinum albums such as \"You Make Me Happy and Sad\" (), \"The Flowery Heart\" (), \"Music Brings Us Together\" (), and \"Emil & Friends\" () have won awards in Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nWakin has appeared in a number of films and made guest appearances on TV and radio programs in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and Japan. Alongside his singing career, he is a restaurateur and also is active in international charitable causes, such as kidney dialysis charities in Singapore, the January 2002 \"Take a Deep Breath\" concert in Taipei to raise money for local health-care organisations, Beijing's 4th Grand Charity Drive for Children in 2005, and Jackie Chan's all-star concerts in Las Vegas.\n\nWakin Chau has formed with distinguished artists Jonathan Lee, Chang Chen-yue, and Lo Ta-yu in the four-member band Superband. In 2010, after finishing all their concerts and tours, they disbanded and resumed their individual careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in July 2005 as the second single of their fourth album \"Mezmerize\".\n\nShavo Odadjian produced the video (and co-directed it alongside Howard Greenhalgh) after allegedly having an image of the video in a nightmare. It is claimed that before the dream he had no intentions of producing the video. In fact he didn't want any special treatment over other possible producers for being in the band so he submitted his idea anonymously.\n\nThe video was shot in the now-closed Los Angeles Theater, which opened in 1931. \"It's an amazing old theater that is due for renovation,\" Tankian said of the place. \"I'm glad they haven't renovated it yet, because it has the right character for what we were looking for. It has a fairy tale vibe.\"\n\n\"Question!\" is written in the key of E minor — a somewhat unusual key for System of a Down, which normally relies heavily on Cm, C#m, and F#m. The song uses four different time signatures (5/4, 9/8, 3/4, and 4/4). The acoustic guitar intro and part of the verse is in 9/8, expressed as 3+2+2+2 (This phrasing suggests a hemiola, and is essentially 4/4 with an extra eighth note on beat 1). The verse briefly switches to 3/4 when Tankian sings \"Are you dreaming?\". The guitar motif after the acoustic intro is in 5/4. This same section appears throughout the song as well. Choruses one and two are in 3/4. The third chorus and the heavy tremolo-picked section towards the end underneath the vocals is in 4/4. Serj Tankian plays acoustic guitar in the intro and deeper in the background behind lead guitarist Daron Malakian.\n\n"}

Vince Aletti of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Walden covers all these bases, out-hopping Kashif (but not Jellybean) with \"So Emotional.\" St. Petersburg Times Eric Snider and Annelise Wamsley wrote: \"`So Emotional,`` the record's token rock offering, is hollow and contrived, as if the trumped-up power guitars are supposed to give the song some guts.\"\n\nAt this time Houston already had a string of five consecutive number-one hits on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"So Emotional\" reached the top of the chart in January 1988, giving her six consecutive number-one singles, putting her in a three-way tie with The Beatles and The Bee Gees. It made its debut at number 47 on October 31, 1987 and after 11 weeks became the first number-one of 1988, eventually receiving gold certification.

The line-up has changed as the group splintered and reformed several times, being active from 1982 to 1985, 1987 to 1991, 1994 to 1997 and 2006 to 2008. The August 2006 line-up was Gray with Stephan Fidock on drums; Penny Ikinger on guitar; Spencer P. Jones on guitar; Nick Rischbieth on bass guitar; and Ash Wednesday on keyboards. Past members include: Johnny Crash (aka Janis Friedenfelds) on drums and Mark Ferrie on bass guitar, who were both ex-Models; Terry Doolan on guitar; Andrew Picouleau on bass guitar; and Ian Forrest on keyboards.\n\nThe group have issued six albums: \"Sacred Cowboys\" (1984), \"We Love You ... Of Course We Do\" (1985), \"Trouble from Providence\" (August 1988), \"Things to Come\" (July 1996), \"Cold Harvest\" (January 2007) and \"1982–85: Nailed to the Cross\" (February 2008). Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described them as \"one of the most confrontational live outfits\" with their music as \"mixed post-punk moodiness and country raunch over a mutant swamp-blues backbeat\".\n\nSacred Cowboys formed in early 1982 in Melbourne with Terry Doolan on guitar (ex-Fizztops), Janis Friedenfelds (aka Johnny Crash) on drums, Mark Ferrie on guitar (both ex-Models), Ian Forrest on keyboards (ex-True Wheels), Garry Gray on lead vocals (ex-The Reals, The Negatives) and Andrew Picouleau on bass guitar (ex-Metronomes, Popgun Men, X-Ray-Z). Gray and Ferrie based the name from watching \"The Groovy Guru\", an episode of the United States TV comedy series, \"Get Smart\". In it, the Groovy Guru and his rock band, the Sacred Cows, use psychedelic music to control the minds of young people.Initially the group were a covers band playing Credence Clearwater Revival, Alex Chilton, The Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart, Suicide and Bob Dylan. They built a reputation as \"one of the most confrontational live outfits\" in the local scene.\n\nWithin six months, Sacred Cowboys had signed with Mushroom Records' White Label and recorded a single, \"Nothing Grows in Texas\", which appeared in November 1982. After a performance on TV pop show, \"Countdown\", the host Molly Meldrum described them as \"the worst group I've seen in five years\", a title the band knew meant they were on the right side of the wrong side of the tracks. Gray responded with \"[Meldrum] had a very good medium at his disposal but he never really used it to benefit the broad spectrum of music that was available in the country\". According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Meldrum's assessment had \"instantly cemented their nefarious reputation as the local scene's \"enfants terribles\". The band's music mixed post-punk moodiness and country raunch over a mutant swamp-blues backbeat\". In July 1983 they released a second single, a cover of Chilton's \"Bangkok\". In the next month they supported US hardcore punk band, Dead Kennedys, at their Melbourne gig.\n\nIn December Sacred Cowboys followed with a six-track self-titled extended play on the White Label, which was produced by Tony Cohen (Models, The Birthday Party). At that time Chris Whelan replaced Forrest on keyboards. Early in the next year, a self-titled album on French label, New Rose Records, was issued. Meanwhile Nick Rischbieth (ex-Related Mechanics) replaced Picouleau on bass guitar and at the same time the band decided to work without keyboards. In 1985 a live, demo compilation, \"We Love You . . . Of Course We Do\", named after a cover of The Rolling Stones single, \"We Love You\", appeared on Man Made Records. However by that time the group went off the road and Gray entered a drug rehabilitation centre to treat his heroin addiction. In August 1988 he declared that the treatment was \"not easy for anyone but the benefit is to be able to come out and continue working and I had to work better than I have before... not a lot of people can get through that sort of thing... Writing is something I've always enjoyed but now it's a more positive thing\". Late in 1984 Ferrie and Friedenfelds formed The Slaughtermen, as a post-punk, alternative, southern gospel group.\n\nLate in 1987 Sacred Cowboys reformed with a line-up of Doolan, Ferrie, Gray and Rischbieth joined by Stephan Fidock on drums (ex-The Reels). Ash Wednesday briefly joined on keyboards (ex-JAB, Metronomes, Einsturzende Neubauten) but left after recording the album, \"Trouble from Providence\". They signed to Sydney-based label, Citadel Records, which released the album in August 1988. It was produced by Ferrie, Doolan, Cohen, and Martin Armiger (Paul Kelly & the Dots, Stephen Cummings). McFarlane described it as \"one of the best independent releases of the year\". It was also issued by Germany's Normal Records, both in the standard nine-track vinyl LP format and as a CD with six bonus tracks. The band issued two singles from the album, the title track in July and \"Hell Sucks\" in December. The latter was more popular and became the group's signature tune. Forrest rejoined on keyboards, late in 1990, but the group disbanded again at the end of the following year.\n\nFrom early 1994 Sacred Cowboys reformed with a line-up of Doolan, Ferrie, Fidock and Gray, joined by Spencer P Jones, then Penny Ikinger on guitar (ex-Wet Taxis, Louis Tillett's Aspersion Caste). They released a compilation CD, seven-track EP, \"Black City\", early that year on the Siren label. In 1997 the Australian edition of \"Rolling Stone\" listed it as one of the Top 100 albums of the 20th century. Another album, \"Things to Come\", was released in July 1996. It was recorded at Atlantis and Espy Studios for Greasy Pole Records and distributed by Shock Records. By that time Spencer P. Jones had joined on guitar (ex-Beasts of Bourbon, Paul Kelly & the Coloured Girls). At various times Sydney-based alternative rock, blues rock band, Beasts of Bourbon, has included Doolan, Ferrie, Friedenfelds or Jones of Sacred Cowboys. By 1997 Sacred Cowboys had gone off the road again, Gray moved to France and was living in Montpellier.\n\nIn 2005 \"Hell Sucks\" was selected for Clinton Walker's compilation of Australian punk and post-punk music, \"Inner City Sounds\". Sacred Cowboys reformed in August 2006 with the line-up of Fidock, Gray, Ikinger, Jones, Rischbieth and Wednesday and in 2008 with Mark Ferrie. They played a series of shows in Melbourne, and the remaining line-up recorded the finishing touches to the album, \"Cold Harvest\", which was released on Bang! Records in January 2007. TJ Honeysuckle at i94bar.com noted that Ikinger and Jones were \"hugely distinctive presences here\" while Gray's vocal delivery \"swings easily from snarling to caressing – he has a snake oil seller's charm at times, a cursing preacher's tone at others\". Radio station, PBS 106.7FM's review described the album \"the songs are narrative in style, a kind of urban uprising driven by dysfunctional dreamers and powerless onlookers\". In February 2008 they issued a compilation album, \"1982–85: Nailed to the Cross\". Amazon.com's editorial review recalls their early style, \"[they] played a wild, dangerous and completely unique brand of rock'n'roll inspired by the artists whose material they cover\". The group toured in support of the release until August that year.\n\nhttp://www.i94bar.com/interviews/proto-punk-is-so-yesterday-garry-gray-on-st-kilda-sacred-cowboys-and-making-sydney-sit-up-and-listen\n\nhttp://www.i94bar.com/albums/dumb-world-negatives-reals-and-judas-iscariot-the-traitors-1974-1978-loaded-skull-discs-shock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n archived from the original on 17 March 2012.

His landscape photographs taken in the Engadine, where he lived and worked for 46 years, are unique on an international as well as a national level. They have had a major influence on an awareness of Switzerland as an unspoiled alpine country of surpassing beauty. Inspired by painters such as Giovanni Segantini and Ferdinand Hodler, Steiner took pictures that reveal a profound respect for and love of nature, as well as a tireless search for timeless beauty and metaphysical truth. His meticulously structured, light-saturated compositions are expressive witnesses of his experience of human insignificance in the face of the greatness and sublimity of the mountain world. Surprisingly, up until now Steiner's work has not been accorded the appreciation it deserves.\n"}

This new company built a more modern roasterie on Vashon Island, Washington in 1995 and manufactured Seattle's Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia Coffee. Seattle Coffee Holdings was purchased in 1998 by AFC Enterprises and renamed Seattle Coffee Company.\n\nTorrefazione Italia expanded to other cities in North America, notably, Vancouver BC, the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. Their coffees are also wholesaled to restaurants, hotels, bakeries and cafés.\n\nStarbucks, another Seattle-based coffee company, purchased Torrefazione Italia along with Seattle's Best Coffee in 2003. Starbucks announced in 2005 that all 17 Torrefazione Italia cafés would be closed before the end of the year, and all of the San Francisco retail locations were closed on 27 October 2005. The coffee brand has been retained, however, and the coffee is available throughout the United States in coffee shops, hotels, resorts, offices, schools, hospitals, and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe Bizzarri family has since started another roaster and coffee chain, Caffè Umbria, which was started by third-generation roaster Emanuele Bizzarri, son of Umberto.

She was the second woman and the first woman of Icelandic origin to serve in the provincial legislature.\n\nHalldorson was born to Halldor Halldorson and Kristin Palsdottir in Lundar, Manitoba. She was educated at Wesley College in Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree. Halldorson worked as a teacher of languages, teaching Latin, French and German from 1918 to 1938 at Jon Bjarnason Academy, a private school started by the Icelandic Lutheran Church in 1913.\n\nShe was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1936 provincial election, defeating Liberal-Progressive incumbent Skuli Sigfusson by 156 votes in the constituency of St. George. She was the first woman elected to the legislature since the resignation of Edith Rogers in 1932.\n\nThe Social Credit League won only five seats (out of 55) in this election, but held the balance of power by maintaining John Bracken's Liberal-Progressive government in office. In 1940, the party formally entered an all-party coalition government with the Liberal-Progressives, Conservatives and Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. Independent Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Lewis Stubbs was initially the only legislator not to join the government.\n\nSocial Credit split on the coalition issue, and Halldorson broke with the rest of her caucus to serve as the legislature's second opposition member. The Social Credit League subsequently expelled the other four MLAs, although they continued to identify themselves as representatives of the party. The reconstructed Social Credit League endorsed Halldorson's decision, and Social Credit Premier of Alberta William Aberhart also supported her.\n\nThe 1941 election greatly reduced Social Credit as a political force in the province. All of the anti-coalition candidates were defeated, and Halldorson finished a distant second against Sigfusson in St George.\n\nIn addition to her career in the legislature, Halldorson served as vice-president and president of the Manitoba Social Credit League in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn 1943, Halldorson contested a federal by-election in Selkirk as a candidate of the Social Credit Party of Canada. She came a very distant third, finishing almost 9,000 votes behind successful candidate William Bryce of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. She was re-nominated in the 1945 provincial election, but declined to stand.\n\nHer brother Christian also served in the Manitoba assembly after her stint there.\n\nHalldorson later taught at Morden, Transcona and at Balmoral Hall.

He attended public schools before going on to earn his law degree at the University of Tennessee. He taught school, reported for the \"Knoxville Sentinel\".\n\ncity attorney of Memphis 1928-1934; delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1940 and 1944; elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-fourth, Seventy-fifth, and Seventy-sixth Congresses and served from January 3, 1935, until his resignation on January 2, 1940, having been elected mayor of Memphis; reelected mayor in 1943 and served until September 1, 1946; resumed the practice of law; temporary president, Tennessee constitutional convention, in 1953; mayor of Memphis in 1955 for unexpired term\n\nA member of the Tennessee General Assembly, Chandler served in the Tennessee state house of representatives in 1917. He served as a captain in the One Hundred and Fourteenth Field Artillery, Thirtieth Division, American Expeditionary Forces, from July 25, 1917, to April 19, 1919, during World War I. and then was a member of Tennessee state senate from 1921 to 1923. He married Dorothy Wyeth on October 10, 1925.\n\nChandler was elected U.S. Representative from Tennessee 9th District, and served from January 3, 1935 to January 2, 1940, when he resigned. He was mayor of Memphis, Tennessee, from 1940 to 1946, and served in that capacity again in 1955. He was also a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Tennessee in 1940 and 1944.\n\nAlthough supported by the E. H. Crump machine, Chandler made significant contributions to the world on his own. He was the author of Chapter 13 bankruptcy legislation. He filed the original suit in \"Baker v. Carr\", the U.S. Supreme Court case that argued against Tennessee's status quo of seldom changing the boundaries of congressional districts, even though population growth in urban areas far outstripped the growth in rural areas. By 1960, the district lines had not been redrawn since 1900 despite a provision in the Constitution of Tennessee requiring them to be redrawn every 10 years. In some cases one state representative district might be more populous by a factor of ten than another, more rural district. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Baker, viewing the case not as one of legislative jurisdiction, but as a case of insuring each individual's right to equal representation.\n\nChandler was considered a sensitive and thoughtful man by some, and that he retired from politics in disappointment after E. H. Crump failed to support him for a senate seat. Chandler was an active and contributing member of the West Tennessee Historical Society. His recollections of early life in Memphis provide one of the clearest and most lucid pictures of Memphis at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nChandler died in Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee, on October 1, 1967 (age 79 years, 361 days). He is interred at Forest Hill Cemetery, Memphis, Tennessee. He died in the same year his son, future mayor Wyeth Chandler, was elected to the first Memphis City Council. His son served as Mayor of Memphis from 1972 until 1982 and later as a judge.\n\n"}
{"id": "2183295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183295", "title": "Andy Ganteaume", "text": "Andy Ganteaume\n\nAndrew Gordon Ganteaume (22 January 1921 – 17 February 2016) was a Trinidadian cricketer who played one Test match for the West Indies in 1948 as a batsman. He scored 112 in his only Test innings which left him with the highest Test batting average in history. Ganteaume played for Trinidad from a young age and was chosen to play in a Test match against England following his good batting form in 1948. However, his slow scoring probably cost him his place and he never played another Test, although he toured England with the West Indies in 1957. At the time of his death, Ganteaume was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer.\n\nGanteaume was born in Belmont, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. He had no formal cricket coaching but made his first-class debut for Trinidad as a wicketkeeper in 1941 as a 19-year-old. He scored 87 batting at number eight. Over the next few seasons, Ganteaume played regularly for Trinidad in first-class competition and for North Trinidad in a non-first-class island competition. He also played football for the Trinidad team around this time, but his time for sport was restricted by his career in the civil service.\n\nFrom batting in the middle-order, Ganteaume was eventually promoted to open the batting as a theory at the time suggested that wicketkeepers might make good openers as they became accustomed to the conditions while keeping wicket; Ganteaume neither believed this theory nor enjoyed being an opener. He scored his maiden first-class century in 1946; a second followed later in the year.\n\nIn the 1947–48 season, the England cricket team toured the West Indies. When the team played in Trinidad, Ganteaume scored 101 and 47 not out in the first match but journalists criticised him for scoring slowly in easy batting conditions. In a second match against the touring side, he scored 5 and 90 but was not selected in the team for the Test match which followed—Ganteaume later suggested his non-selection was a result of his underprivileged background. However, an injury to Jeff Stollmeyer, one of the West Indies' opening batsmen, before the game meant that Ganteaume was called up into the side.\n\nEngland batted first to score 362, but when the West Indies batted, Ganteaume and his opening partner, George Carew shared a partnership of 173. Once more, Ganteaume was criticised for slow batting, although he later suggested that he had concentrated on scoring singles to allow his in-form partner to face the bowling. On the third day, he carried on batting to reach his century, the first in a Test match by a Trinidadian in Trinidad. The innings took around 270 minutes, but he slowed down as he neared three-figures, and the West Indies' captain sent out a note asking the batsmen to score faster. Other batsmen also batted slowly, and Ganteaume later claimed that England used negative, run-saving tactics to slow the scoring rate. He did not bat in the second innings, when the West Indies needed to score runs quickly in an unsuccessful attempt to win the game. The match was drawn, having been earlier interrupted by rain which cut the playing time, but in the knowledge that quick scoring was vital, Ganteaume's slow batting adversely affected the West Indies' chances of victory.\n\nGanteaume did not play in the next Test match—he was replaced by John Goddard who came into the team as part of a pre-arranged scheme to rotate the captaincy. Ganteaume was chosen in a preliminary 24-man squad to tour India and Pakistan in 1948–49, but did not make the final selection of 16 players, and was overlooked for the 1950 tour of England. He continued to play irregularly for Trinidad in the following years, but played no further representative cricket until 1957.\n\nGanteaume was selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1957 at the age of 36. He played 19 first-class matches on the tour and scored 800 runs at an average of 27.58. He passed fifty in seven innings, with a top-score of 92 against Glamorgan. Norman Preston, the editor of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", suggested neither Ganteaume nor any of the other three specialist opening batsmen in the team \"came up to expectations\", forcing Frank Worrell to open the batting. He never came close to selection for a Test match. After the tour, Ganteaume played just twice more for Trinidad in first-class cricket, and ended his career with 2,785 first-class runs at an average of 34.81 and five centuries. Having played just one Test innings, Ganteaume was left with a Test batting average of 112, the highest career average by a former player.\n\nThere are several possible reasons why Ganteaume played no further Test cricket after his single match. Apart from the slow pace of his batting during that hundred—Goddard later suggested that it would have been better for Ganteaume's career to score a rapid 60 than a slow hundred— West Indies' batting was strong at the time and there was plenty of competition for places in the team. Even so, his teammate and later West Indies captain Jeff Stollmeyer suggested that he was unlucky to be left out of subsequent teams. It is also possible that Ganteaume's career was affected by his attitude to authority. The cricket journalist Martin Williamson suggests: \"Ganteaume probably paid as much for his anti-establishment attitude as for slow scoring. He was certainly not someone who was going to bow and scrape to the white players who still dominated the region's cricket.\" In later years, Ganteaume served as a Test selector and was West Indies manager in 1973–74. In 2007, his autobiography, \"My Story: The Other Side of the Coin\" was published, in which he criticised the West Indies \"establishment\" of his playing days. He died at the age of 95 on 17 February 2016. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer, and the second oldest in the world.\n\n"}

It is currently on hiatus due to financial constraints.\n\nThe magazine's concept and relaunch were achieved through the efforts of Sohail Nakhooda, a Jordan-based LSE graduate who was the first Muslim to study Christian theology at the Vatican. His vision for the magazine, as is the vision of the current staff, aims to broaden perspectives on Islam and provide a forum for Muslims to articulate their concerns while establishing cross-cultural relations between Muslims and their neighbors and co-religionists. The magazine is produced in English and draws from scholars, thinkers, writers and activists from around the world.\n\nThe magazine was first published in 1992 in the UK, and re-launched in 2004 from Amman, Jordan. In 2009 the magazine was renamed as \"Islamica\".\n\n\"Islamica\" is published in English on a monthly basis.\n\nSince the re-launch, \"Islamica\" has developed a diverse Advisory Board of scholars, thinkers, and academics to help define its editorial perspective. This board includes the following individuals: Umar Faruq Abd-Allah, Osman Bakar, John Esposito, Hamza Yusuf, Jeremy Henzell-Thomas, Anwar Ibrahim, Enes Karic, Nuh Keller, Joseph Lumbard, Ingrid Mattson, Daniel Abdal-Hayy Moore, Abdal Hakim Murad, Sulayman Nyang, S. Abdallah Schleifer, Zaid Shakir\n\nThe magazine generally takes an orthodox Sunni Muslim perspective. In its earlier years, Islamica had a more Anglo-European outlook on issues, as was reflected by its primarily British-educated editorial team. In 2004, its core editorial staff was expanded to include six editors based in the United States. It was during this time that a more subtle transition was made towards addressing issues related to Islam for a primarily US or American audience. Evidence of this shift can be found in recent articles published by Sherman Jackson, David Cole, Samuel Huntington, John Esposito and other prominent American thinkers.\n\nAdditionally, regular columnists based in the US including the comedian Azhar Usman, the award-winning poet Daniel Abdal Hayy Moore, the essayist and writer Haroon Moghul and Asma Uddin, a lawyer and research associate for Umar F. Abd-Allah were also added to the magazine. Uddin is also a fellow with the Becket Fund for Religious Freedom. Other regular columnists include Faraz Rabbani, Yusuf Zanella, the British academic, H A Hellyer and Jeremy Henzell Thomas. However, the editor-in-chief, Sohail Nakhooda, remains in Amman.\n\n\n"}

Mitsubishi manufactured six aircraft under license from Junkers. These aircraft, designated Army Type 92 Heavy Bomber, served through the 1930s. During World War II, the Ki-20 served in a variety of transport and support roles.\n\nIn the late-1920s, as Junkers developed the Junkers G.38, Mitsubishi representatives in Germany expressed an interest in a military version of this civilian transport. At the time, the G.38 was the largest landplane in the world. Junkers completed a design study for a military bomber/transport, based on the G.38, designated the K.51. This design was not accepted by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium.\n\nThe K.51 design study was of interest to Japan. A licensing and manufacturing agreement was reached and in 1932 the first two Ki-20s were completed by Mitsubishi, utilizing Junkers-made parts. A prototype was successfully flown in Japan by a German test pilot in that year.\n\nFour additional Ki-20s were built between 1933 and 1935. All of these subsequent models used Mitsubishi-built parts. Ongoing development focused on engine upgrades to all examples to address the persistent issue of the aircraft being underpowered. Several engine upgrades were completed during the lifetime of these aircraft. The initial Junkers L88 engines were replaced by the more powerful Jumo 204 engines, also built under license by Mitsubishi. Additionally Kawasaki Ha-9 engines were utilized for testing purposes.\n\nDuring World War II, the Japanese originally intended to utilize the Ki-20s to attack the forts at the entrance to Manila Bay in the Philippines and for deep penetration missions into Siberia. For these purposes, they were armed with six gun positions and structurally enabled to carry a 5,000 kg (11,020 lb) bomb load. These aircraft were the largest operated by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and their existence within it was kept secret. As a result, they were issued their out-of-sequence \"Kitai\" number '20' only when they were finally revealed in 1940.\n\nA single example survived to the end of hostilities as a museum piece in the Tokorozawa Aviation Memorial Hall. All examples of this aircraft were either destroyed during the war or broken up for scrap during the latter portion of the 1940s.\n\n\n"}

Over $600 is spent for every square foot of retail space each year.\n\nBellevue Square was first opened on August 20, 1946, trading under the name \"Bellevue Shopping Square\", with the first suburban department store opened by Marshall Field & Co. through its Seattle-based subsidiary, Frederick & Nelson.\n\nWith the mall's name shortened to Bellevue Square a few years later, JCPenney opened a store in 1955. Nordstrom, then a local shoe store, opened in 1958, before adding apparel and becoming the third major anchor in 1966, initially under the name Nordstrom Best.\n\nIn the 1980s, the mall, then led by the original developer's son, Kemper Freeman Jr., expanded in several phases, finally adding a location for the Seattle-based department store The Bon Marché in 1984. In 1992, with the bankruptcy and closure of Frederick & Nelson and collapse of a deal to lease part of the vacated space to Saks Fifth Avenue, the center used the opportunity to reconfigure the vacant anchor as mall shop space. 1994 saw the addition of a separate The Bon Marché Home Store, while Nordstrom expanded the size of their store by half. In 2003, The Bon Marché stores were renamed Bon-Macy's, and in 2005 they adopted the name Macy's.\n\nIn 2007, Bellevue Square was linked by a skybridge to Lincoln Square, another Kemper Freeman owned property which opened in 2005 and expanded in 2017.\n\nBellevue Square continues to be owned by Kemper Freeman Jr. and his family, one of the few shopping centers in the United States that have not been purchased by a real estate investment trust (REIT).\n\nIn September 2014, JCPenney announced that it was closing its store after staying in the mall for 55 years. The 200,000 square foot area was converted into smaller retail stores in May 2015 for the following holiday season including UNIQLO and Zara.\n\nOn May 31st, 2020, much of the interior of Bellevue Square was damaged by looters in a riot staged by organized gang members. The mall was later secured by the Washington National Guard.\n"}

After a spell as a journalist in local radio in Manchester, she joined the staff of \"The Sunday Times\" in 1979 and stayed at the newspaper until 1984, although Smith still contributes book reviews, usually on crime fiction, to the publication. She has had a regular column in \"The Guardian\"'s Weekend supplement, also freelancing for the newspaper and has contributed to \"The Independent\", \"The Independent on Sunday\", and the \"New Statesman\".\n\nIn her non-fiction Smith displays a commitment to atheism, feminism (\"Misogynies: Reflections on Myths and Malice\", 1989) and republicanism (\"Down with the Royals\", 2015). She is scornful of popular culture and once gave away her television set to her ex-husband, although she acquired a new set almost a decade later.\n\nOn 15 September 2010, Smith, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in \"The Guardian\", stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK.\n\nIn November 2011, she gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press and media standards following the telephone hacking practised by the \"News of the World\". She testified that she considered celebrities thought they could control press content if they put themselves into the public domain when, in reality the opposite was more likely.\n\nAlthough Smith was opposed to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, disputing the false claims about the Saddam Hussein regime's possession of Weapon of mass destruction, she has taken a different view during the Syrian civil war. As a consequence of the Syrian refugee crisis, and the 2013 Ghouta attacks using chemical weapons, she has called for military intervention.\n\nOutside the UK, Smith is probably best known for the Loretta Lawson series of crime novels which were published between 1987 and 1995. \"What Will Survive\" (2007) is a novel set in Lebanon in 1997 concerning a journalist's investigation into the death of a model and anti-landmine campaigner.\n\nShe is a keen supporter of Classics in state schools, describing the 1997–2010 Labour government's failure to act on the matter as \"hardly their finest hour\" and is a patron of The Iris Project. Smith is a supporter of the pressure group Republic and a Patron of Humanists UK. In 2015, she was elected chair of Labour Humanists, a group promoting secularist policies and humanist values within the Labour party. She is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society \n\nJoan Smith was appointed the Executive Director of Hacked Off in late May 2014 in succession to Brian Cathcart. Smith assumed the position in June, but stood down in late June 2015 to return to her writing career full-time.\n\nSmith was married to journalist Francis Wheen between 1985 and 1993.\n\nShe had a relationship with Denis MacShane, a British Labour Party politician at the time. On 25 May 2009, during the expenses scandal of 2009 Smith wrote an article for \"The Guardian\" titled \"I am sick of my country and this hysteria over MPs\" objecting to the furore over MPs' expenses which she cited as an example of bullying in public life, stating that her (then) partner was an (unnamed) MP.\n\nThe couple subsequently split up in 2010 after seven years together; MacShane was subsequently sentenced to six months of imprisonment for submitting false invoices.\n\nIn 2003 she was offered the MBE for her services to PEN, but refused the award.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This platform became very popular in Mexico in 1994, when the model renamed Chevy Swing (4 door) and Chevy Joy (2 door) was imported from Spain. In 1996, the models were built in Mexico and several variants were offered: a 4-door sedan (called Monza), a 2- and a 4-door hatchback, a pickup truck, and a station wagon (imported from Chile).

{"id": "2183343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183343", "title": "Tai shogi", "text": "Tai shogi\n\nTai shogi (泰将棋 \"tai shōgi\" or 無上泰将棋 \"mujō tai shōgi\" \"grand chess\", renamed from 無上大将棋 \"mujō dai shōgi\" \"supreme chess\" to avoid confusion with 大将棋 \"dai shōgi\") is a large-board variant of shogi (Japanese chess). The game dates to the 15th century and is based on earlier large-board shogi games. Before the discovery of taikyoku shogi in 1997, tai shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant, if not board game, ever. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves. It was never a popular game; indeed, a single production of six game sets in the early 17th century was a notable event.\n\nLike other large-board variants, but unlike standard shogi, the game is played without drops, and uses a promotion-by-capture rule.\n\nBecause of the terse and often incomplete wording of the historical sources for the large shogi variants, except for chu shogi and to a lesser extent dai shogi (which were at some points of time the most prestigious forms of shogi being played), the historical rules of tai shogi are not clear. Different sources often differ significantly in the moves attributed to the pieces, and the degree of contradiction (summarised below with the listing of most known alternative moves) is such that it is likely impossible to reconstruct the \"true historical rules\" with any degree of certainty, if there ever was such a thing. It is not clear if the game was ever played much historically, as the few sets that were made seem to have been intended only for display.\n\nTai shogi is very similar to other large-board shogi variants: dai dai shogi, maka dai dai shogi, and tenjiku shogi. Where the same pieces are found, they move the same way. The only difference is in how these pieces promote, which is distinct for each shogi variant. The one variant which is an exception to this generalization is the largest, taikyoku shogi, where the moves differ as well.\n\nThe objective of the game is to capture the opponent's emperor and prince (or princes). When the last of these is captured, the game ends. There are no rules for check or checkmate; however, in practice a player resigns when checkmated.\n\nTwo players, Black and White (or 先手 \"sente\" and 後手 \"gote\"), play on a board ruled into a grid of 25 \"ranks\" (rows) and 25 \"files\" (columns), for a total of 625 squares. The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color.\n\nEach player has a set of 177 wedge-shaped pieces of 93 types. In all, the players must remember 99 moves for these pieces. The pieces are of slightly different sizes. From largest to smallest (or roughly most to least powerful) they are:\n\nSeveral of the English names were chosen to correspond to rough equivalents in Western chess, rather than as translations of the Japanese names.\n\nEach piece has its name in the form of two kanji written on its face. On the reverse side of some pieces are one or two other characters, often in a different color (commonly red instead of black); this reverse side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. The pieces of the two sides do not differ in color, but instead each piece is shaped like a wedge, and faces forward, toward the opposing side. This shows who controls the piece during play.\n\nListed here are the pieces of the game and, if they promote, which pieces they promote to.\n\nBelow is a diagram showing the setup of one player's pieces. The way one player sees their own pieces is the same way the opposing player will see their pieces.\n\nThe players alternate making a move, with Black moving first. (The traditional terms 'black' and 'white' are used to differentiate the sides during discussion of the game, but are no longer literally descriptive.) A move consists of moving a single piece on the board and potentially \"promoting\" that piece or displacing (\"capturing\") an opposing piece. Each of these options is detailed below.\n\n\"When the same piece occurs in tai shogi and maka dai dai shogi, it moves and promotes the same way in both.\"\n\nAn opposing piece is captured by \"displacement\": That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece (meaning another piece controlled by the moving player).\n\nEach piece on the game moves in a characteristic pattern. Pieces move either \"orthogonally\" (that is, forward, backward, left, or right, in the direction of one of the arms of a plus sign, +), or \"diagonally\" (in the direction of one of the arms of a multiplication sign, ×). The emperor, lion, and knight are exceptions at the beginning of the game, in that they do not move, or are not required to move, in a straight line. (The Buddhist spirit and furious fiend are similar, but they only appear as pieces promote.)\n\nIf a piece that cannot retreat or move aside advances across the board until it can no longer move, it must remain there until captured. This applies to the pawn, lance, ram's-head soldier, stone general, wood general, and iron general upon reaching the farthest rank, and to the knight upon reaching either of the two farthest ranks.\n\nMany pieces are capable of several kinds of movement, with the type of movement most often depending on the direction in which they move. The movement categories are:\n\nSome pieces move only one square at a time. (If a friendly piece occupies an adjacent square, the moving piece may not move in that direction; if an opposing piece is there, it may be displaced and captured.)\n\nThe step movers are the prince, drunk elephant, neighbor king, blind tiger, blind monkey, ferocious leopard, reclining dragon, Chinese cock, old monkey, evil wolf, the generals (except the wood general), angry boar, cat sword, coiled serpent, deva, dark spirit, go between, and the 25 pawns on each side.\n\nSome pieces can move along a limited number (2, 3, or 5) of free (empty) squares along a straight line in certain directions. Other than the limited distance, they move like ranging pieces (see below).\n\nThese pieces are the water buffalo, standard bearer, vermillion sparrow, turtle-snake, blue dragon, white tiger, dove, she-devil, golden bird, great dragon, white elephant, lion dog, wrestler, Guardian of the Gods, Buddhist devil, golden deer, silver hare, fierce eagle, old kite, violent ox, flying dragon, old rat, enchanted badger, flying horse, prancing stag, violent bear, the barbarians, and the wood general.\n\nSeveral pieces can \"jump\", that is, they can pass over any intervening piece, whether friend or foe, with no effect on either. These are the lion, kirin, phoenix, poison snake, donkey, and knight.\n\nMany pieces can move any number of empty squares along a straight line, limited only by the edge of the board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass a piece that is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot move in that direction at all.\n\nThe ranging pieces are the soaring eagle, horned falcon, queen, rushing bird, the demons, free dream-eater, water buffalo, flying ox, soldier, dragon king, dragon horse, the chariots, rook, bishop, white horse, whale, standard bearer, vermillion sparrow, turtle-snake, blue dragon, white tiger, side dragon, golden bird, great dragon, white elephant, golden deer, movers, howling dog, ram's-head solder and lance.\n\nThe hook mover, long-nosed goblin, Capricorn, and peacock can move any number of squares along a straight line, as a normal ranging piece, but may also abruptly change tack left or right by 90° at any one place along the route, and then continue as a ranging piece. Turning a corner like this is optional.\n\nThe range covered by a hook move is the equivalent of two moves by a rook, or two moves by a bishop, depending the piece. However, a hook move is functionally a single move: The piece cannot capture twice in one move, nor may it capture and then move on. It must stop before an intervening piece (unless it first changes direction to avoid it), and must stop when it captures, just like any other ranging piece. It can only change direction once per move.\n\nThe lion, lion dog, soaring eagle, and horned falcon have sequential multiple-capture abilities, called \"lion moves\". Among the pieces that only appear with promotion, so do the teaching king, buddhist spirit, and furious fiend. The details of these powerful moves are described for the lion, below.\n\n\"When a piece occurs in both tai shogi and maka dai dai shogi, it moves and promotes the same way.\" Betza's funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation \"xxxayyyK stands for an \"xxxK move followed by an \"yyy\"K move, not necessarily in the same direction. Larger numbers of 'legs' can be indicated by repeated application of 'a'. Directional modifiers on continuation legs must be interpreted relative to the previous leg, where 'f' means 'continue in the same direction'; default is 'all directions'. The default modality of the final leg is the usual 'mc', but on non-final legs also includes a hop over an obstacle at their end-point, provided the path does not bend back onto itself there. Other (combinations of) modalities must be written explicitly. U denotes the \"universal leaper\", a piece which can jump to any square on the board except the one that it is on.\n\nEmperor (自在)天王 \"(jizai) tennō\"\n\nPrince 太子 \"taishi\"\n\nHook mover 鉤行 \"kōgyō\"\n\nLong-nosed goblin 天狗 \"tengu\"\n\nCapricorn 摩𩹄 \"makatsu\"\n\nPeacock 孔雀 \"kujaku\"\n\nSoaring eagle 飛鷲 \"hijū\"\n\nHorned falcon 角鷹 \"kakuō\"\n\nQueen 奔王 \"honnō\"\n\nRushing bird 行鳥 \"gyōchō\"\n\nFree demon 奔鬼 \"honki\"\n\nFree dream-eater 奔獏 \"honbaku\"\n\nWater buffalo 水牛 \"suigyū\"\n\nFlying Ox 飛牛 \"higyū\"\n\nSoldier 兵士 \"heishi\"\n\nDragon king 龍王 \"ryūō\"\n\nDragon horse 龍馬 \"ryūme\"\n\nSide chariot 走車 \"sōsha\"\n\nRook 飛車 \"hisha\"\n\nBishop 角行 \"kakugyō\"\n\nLion 獅子 \"shishi\"\n\nWhite horse 白駒 \"hokku\"\n\nWhale 鯨鯢 \"keigei\"\n\nStandard bearer 前旗 \"zenki\"\n\nVermillion sparrow 朱雀 \"suzaku\"\n\n\"There are two completely different claims for the movement of the sparrow.\"\n\n\nTurtle-snake 玄武 \"genbu\"\n\n\"There are two different movement options claimed for the turtle-snake:\"\n\n\nBlue dragon 青龍 \"seiryū\"\n\nWhite tiger 白虎 \"byakko\"\n\nRight chariot 右車 \"usha\"\n\nLeft chariot 左車 \"sasha\"\n\nSide dragon 横龍 \"ōryū\"\n\nDove 鳩槃 \"kyūhan\"\n\nShe-devil 夜叉 \"yasha\"\n\nGolden bird 金翅 \"kinshi\"\n\nGreat dragon 大龍 \"dairyū\"\n\n\"There are two descriptions of the move of this piece.

(If it can: a few important pieces do not promote.) Promotion has the effect of changing how a piece moves. See the table above for what each piece promotes to. Promotion is effected by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. Promotion is both compulsory and permanent. Often \"demotion\" would be a better word, for most powerful pieces 'promote' to a gold general, which is a weak piece. It is the weaker pieces that tend to become more powerful upon making a capture.\n\nThis means that a player only gets to attack or defend with many of the original lion and hook movers once each before they lose their powers. To permanently gain such ability, certain weaker pieces must be promoted.\n\nThis is all very different from smaller shogi variants, where pieces promote when they cross a \"promotion zone\" (the enemy camp), and where promotion is optional and usually a good thing. The dots on the tai shogi board that would represent promotion zones in other games are only there as placement guides for the initial setup of the two camps.\n\nSome pieces promote, or demote, to a piece that exists in the initial setup of the board. However, such a piece cannot then promote a second time as its namesake does. For example, a gold general promotes to a free gold. However, while a hook mover demotes to a gold general on its first capturing move, it does not promote to a free gold on its second. Rather, it remains a gold general for the rest of the game. This should be clear from the game equipment, for each piece only has two sides.\n\nMany of the step movers promote to free-ranging pieces but retain their directions of movement. These were listed above after the unpromoted pieces. Other pieces only appear as a result of promotion. They are as follows:\n\n\"These are in addition to the 'free' pieces mentioned in the previous section.\"\n\nTeaching king 教王 \"kyōō\"\n\nBuddhist spirit 法性 \"hōsei\"\n\nFurious fiend 奮迅 \"funjin\"\n\nWizard stork 仙鶴 \"senkaku\"\n\nMountain witch 山母 \"sambo\"\n\nSquare mover 方行 \"hōgyō\"\n\nFragrant elephant 香象 \"kōzō\"\n\nGreat elephant 大象 \"taizō\"\n\nFree bear 奔熊 \"honyū\"\n\nFree boar 奔猪 \"honcho\"\n\nBat 蝙蝠 \"kōmori\"\n\nWhen a player makes a move, such that the opponent's sole remaining emperor or prince could be captured on the following move, the move is said to \"give check\" to the emperor or prince; the emperor or prince is said to be \"in check\". If a player's last emperor or prince is in check and no legal move by that player will get it out of check, the checking move is also \"mate\", and effectively wins the game.\n\nUnlike Western chess, a player need not move out of check, and indeed may even move into check. Although obviously not often a good idea, a player with more than one royal (emperor or prince) may occasionally sacrifice one of these pieces as part of a gambit.\n\nA player is not allowed to give perpetual check to the sole objective piece.\n\nA player who captures the opponent's sole remaining emperor or prince wins the game. In practice this rarely happens, as a player will resign when checkmated, as otherwise when loss is inevitable.\n\nA player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games.)\n\nAnother possible, if rather uncommon, way for a game to end is repetition (\"sennichite\"). If the same position occurs four times with the same player to play, then the game is no contest. Recall, however, the prohibition against perpetual check.\n\nThe method used in English-language texts to express shogi moves was established by George Hodges in 1976. It is derived from the algebraic notation used for chess, but differs in several respects. Modifications have been made for tai shogi.\n\nA typical example is P-8h.\nThe first letter represents the piece moved (see above).\nPromoted pieces have a + added in front of the letter. (e.g., +CC for a wizard stork (promoted Chinese cock). The designation of the piece is followed by a symbol indicating the type of move: - for an ordinary move or x for a capture. Next is the designation for the square on which the piece lands. This consists of a number representing the file and a lowercase letter representing the rank, with 1a being the top right corner (as seen from Black's point of view) and 25y being the bottom left corner. (This method of designating squares is based on Japanese convention, which, however, uses Japanese numerals instead of letters. For example, the square 2c is denoted by 2三 in Japanese.)\n\nIf a soaring eagle, horned falcon, lion or Buddhist spirit captures by 'igui’, the square of the piece being captured is used instead of the destination square, and this is preceded by the symbol '!'. If a double capture is made, then it is added after the first capture.\n\nIf a capture mandates the player to promote the piece, then a + is added to the end to signify that the promotion was taken. For example, ORx7c+ indicates an old rat capturing on 7c and promoting.\n\nIn cases where the above notation would be ambiguous, the designation of the start square is added after the designation for the piece in order to make clear which piece is meant.\n\nMoves are commonly numbered as in chess.\n\nAccording to the German Chu Shogi Association, the average values of the pieces are (using the interpretations of the English-language sources):\n\nThese average values do not take into account the special status of the prince as a royal piece, or emperor as disposable if there's a prince and other piece(s). They have also been normalized so that the pawn is worth 1 point to avoid fractions. Additionally, pieces change value if they have a good chance of promotion. This is particularly significant for the hook mover and capricorn, which are two of the most powerful pieces in the game, but \"promote\" to the weak gold general; and the old kite and poisonous snake, which promote respectively to the hook mover and long-nosed goblin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2183356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183356", "title": "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "text": "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition\n\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic expedition of 1914–1917 is considered to be the last major expedition of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Conceived by Sir Ernest Shackleton, the expedition was an attempt to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent. After Amundsen's South Pole expedition in 1911, this crossing remained, in Shackleton's words, the \"one great main object of Antarctic journeyings\". The expedition failed to accomplish this objective, but became recognized instead as an epic feat of endurance.\n\nShackleton had served in the Antarctic on the \"Discovery\" expedition of 1901–1904, and had led the \"Nimrod\" expedition of 1907–1909. In this new venture he proposed to sail to the Weddell Sea and to land a shore party near Vahsel Bay, in preparation for a transcontinental march via the South Pole to the Ross Sea. A supporting group, the Ross Sea party, would meanwhile establish camp in McMurdo Sound, and from there lay a series of supply depots across the Ross Ice Shelf to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier. These depots would be essential for the transcontinental party's survival, as the group would not be able to carry enough provisions for the entire crossing. The expedition required two ships: under Shackleton for the Weddell Sea party, and , under Aeneas Mackintosh, for the Ross Sea party.\n\n\"Endurance\" became beset in the ice of the Weddell Sea before reaching Vahsel Bay, and drifted northward, held in the pack ice, throughout the Antarctic winter of 1915. Eventually the ship was crushed and sunk, stranding its 28-man complement on the ice. After months spent in makeshift camps as the ice continued its northwards drift, the party took to the lifeboats to reach the inhospitable, uninhabited Elephant Island. Shackleton and five others then made an open-boat journey in the to reach South Georgia. From there, Shackleton was eventually able to mount a rescue of the men waiting on Elephant Island and bring them home without loss of life. On the other side of the continent, the Ross Sea party overcame great hardships to fulfil its mission. \"Aurora\" was blown from her moorings during a gale and was unable to return, leaving the shore party marooned without proper supplies or equipment. Nevertheless, the depots were laid, but three lives were lost before the party's eventual rescue.\n\nDespite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the \"Nimrod\" Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\"a bit of a floating gent\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\". The next work, he said, would be \"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective.\n\nOn 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.\n\nNews of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\". \n\nShackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to adopt his plans, although the eventual scheme announced by Shackleton owed little to Bruce. On 29 December 1913, having acquired his first promises of financial backing—a £10,000 grant from the British Government—Shackleton made his plans public, in a letter to \"The Times\".\n\nShackleton called his new expedition the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, because he felt that \"not only the people of these islands, but our kinsmen in all the lands under the Union Jack will be willing to assist towards the carrying out of the ... programme of exploration.\" To arouse the interest of the general public, Shackleton issued a detailed programme early in 1914. The expedition was to consist of two parties and two ships. The Weddell Sea party would travel in the and continue to the Vahsel Bay area, where fourteen men would land of whom six, under Shackleton, would form the Transcontinental Party. This group, with 69 dogs, two motor sledges, and equipment \"embodying everything that the experience of the leader and his expert advisers can suggest\", would undertake the journey to the Ross Sea. The remaining eight shore party members would carry out scientific work, three going to Graham Land, three to Enderby Land and two remaining at base camp.\n\nThe Ross Sea party would set up its base in McMurdo Sound, on the opposite side of the continent. After landing they would lay depots on the route of the transcontinental party as far as the Beardmore Glacier, hopefully meeting that party there and assisting it home. They would also make geological and other observations.\n\nShackleton estimated that he would need £50,000 (current value £) to carry out the simplest version of his plan. He did not believe in appeals to the public: \"(they) cause endless book-keeping worries\". His chosen method of fund-raising was to solicit contributions from wealthy backers, and he had begun this process early in 1913, with little initial success. The first significant encouragement came in December 1913, when the Government offered him £10,000, provided he could raise an equivalent amount from private sources. The Royal Geographical Society, from which he had expected nothing, gave him £1,000—according to Huntford, Shackleton, in a grand gesture, advised them that he would only need to take up half of this sum. Lord Rosebery, who had previously expressed his lack of interest in polar expeditions, gave £50. \n\nIn February 1914, \"The New York Times\" reported that playwright J. M. Barrie—a close friend of Captain Scott—had confidentially donated $50,000 (about £10,000). With time running out, contributions were eventually secured during the first half of 1914. Dudley Docker of the Birmingham Small Arms Company gave £10,000, wealthy tobacco heiress Janet Stancomb-Wills gave a \"generous\" sum (the amount was not revealed), and, in June, Scottish industrialist Sir James Key Caird donated £24,000 (current value £). Shackleton informed the \"Morning Post\" that \"this magnificent gift relieves me of all anxiety\".\n\nShackleton now had the money to proceed. He acquired, for £14,000 (current value £), a 300-ton barquentine called \"Polaris\", which had been built for the Belgian explorer Adrien de Gerlache for an expedition to Spitsbergen. This scheme had collapsed and the ship became available. Shackleton changed her name to , reflecting his family motto \"By endurance we conquer\". For a further £3,200 (current value £), he acquired Douglas Mawson's expedition ship , which was lying in Hobart, Tasmania. This would act as the Ross Sea party's vessel.\n\nHow much money Shackleton raised to meet the total costs of the expedition (later estimated by the \"Daily Mail\" to be around £80,000) is uncertain, since the size of the Stancomb-Wills donation is not known. Money was a constant problem for Shackleton, who as an economy measure halved the funding allocated to the Ross Sea party, a fact which the party's commander Aeneas Mackintosh only discovered when he arrived in Australia to take up his duties. Mackintosh was forced to haggle and plead for money and supplies to make his part of the expedition viable. Shackleton had, however, realised the revenue-earning potential of the expedition. He sold the exclusive newspaper rights to the \"Daily Chronicle\", and formed the Imperial Trans Antarctic Film Syndicate to take advantage of the film rights.\n\nAccording to legend, Shackleton posted an advertisement in a London paper, stating: \"\"Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success\".\" Searches for the original advertisement have proved unsuccessful, and the story is generally regarded as apocryphal. Shackleton received more than 5,000 applications for places on the expedition, including a letter from \"three sporty girls\" who suggested that if their feminine garb was inconvenient they would \"just love to don masculine attire.\"\n\nEventually the crews for the two arms of the expedition were trimmed down to 28 apiece, including William Bakewell, who joined the ship in Buenos Aires, his friend Perce Blackborow who stowed away when his application was turned down, and several last-minute appointments made to the Ross Sea party in Australia. A temporary crewman was Sir Daniel Gooch, grandson of the renowned railway pioneer Daniel Gooch, who stepped in to help Shackleton as a dog handler at the last moment and signed up for an able seaman's pay. Gooch agreed to sail with \"Endurance\" as far as South Georgia.\n\nAs his second-in-command, Shackleton chose Frank Wild, who had been with him on both the \"Discovery\" and \"Nimrod\" expeditions, and was one of the Farthest South party in 1909. Wild had just returned from Mawson's Australian Antarctic Expedition. To captain \"Endurance\" Shackleton had wanted John King Davis, who had commanded \"Aurora\" during the Australian Antarctic Expedition. Davis refused, thinking the enterprise was \"foredoomed\", so the appointment went to Frank Worsley, who claimed to have applied to the expedition after learning of it in a dream. Royal Navy Chief Petty Officer Tom Crean, who had been awarded the Albert Medal for saving the life of Lieutenant Edward Evans on the Terra Nova Expedition, took leave from the navy to sign on as \"Endurance\"s second officer; another experienced Antarctic hand, Alfred Cheetham, became third officer. Two \"Nimrod\" veterans were assigned to the Ross Sea party: Mackintosh who commanded it, and Ernest Joyce. Shackleton had hoped that the \"Aurora\" would be staffed by a naval crew, and had asked the Admiralty for officers and men, but was turned down. After pressing his case, Shackleton was given one officer from the Royal Marines, Captain Thomas Orde-Lees, who was Superintendent of Physical Training at the Marines training depot.\n\nThe scientific staff of six accompanying \"Endurance\" comprised the two surgeons, Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy; a geologist, James Wordie; a biologist, Robert Clark; a physicist Reginald W. James; and Leonard Hussey, a meteorologist who would eventually edit Shackleton's expedition account \"South\". The visual record of the expedition was the responsibility of its photographer Frank Hurley and its artist George Marston. The final composition of the Ross Sea party was hurried. Some who left Britain for Australia to join \"Aurora\" resigned before it departed for the Ross Sea, and a full complement of crew was in doubt until the last minute. Within the party only Mackintosh and Joyce had any previous Antarctic experience; Mackintosh had lost an eye as the result of an accident during the \"Nimrod\" expedition and had gone home early.\n\n\"Endurance\", without Shackleton (who was detained in England by expedition business), left Plymouth on 8 August 1914, heading first for Buenos Aires. Here Shackleton, who had travelled on a faster ship, rejoined the expedition. Hurley also came on board, together with Bakewell and the stowaway, Blackborow, while several others left the ship or were discharged. On 26 October, the ship sailed for the South Atlantic, arriving in South Georgia on 5 November. Shackleton's original intention was that the crossing would take place in the first season, 1914–1915. Although he soon recognised the impracticality of this, he neglected to inform Mackintosh and the Ross Sea party of his change of plan. According to the \"Daily Chronicle\"s correspondent Ernest Perris, a cable intended for Macintosh was never sent.\n\nAfter a month-long halt in the Grytviken whaling station, \"Endurance\" departed for the Antarctic on 5 December. Two days later, Shackleton was disconcerted to encounter pack ice as far north as 57° 26′S, forcing the ship to manoeuvre. During the following days there were more tussles with the pack, which, on 14 December, was thick enough to halt the ship for 24 hours. Three days later, the ship was stopped again. Shackleton commented: \"I had been prepared for evil conditions in the Weddell Sea, but had hoped that the pack would be loose. What we were encountering was fairly dense pack of a very obstinate character\".\n\n\"Endurance\"s progress was frustratingly slow, until, on 22 December, leads opened up and the ship was able to continue steadily southward. This continued for the next two weeks, taking the party deep into the Weddell Sea. Further delays then slowed progress after the turn of the year, before a lengthy run south during 7–10 January 1915 brought them close to the ice walls which guarded the Antarctic coastal region of Coats Land. This territory had been discovered and named by William Speirs Bruce in 1904, during the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. On 15 January, \"Endurance\" came abreast of a great glacier, the edge of which formed a bay which appeared a good landing place. However, Shackleton considered it too far north of Vahsel Bay for a landing, \"except under pressure of necessity\"—a decision he would later regret. On 17 January, the ship reached a latitude of 76° 27′S, where land was faintly discernible. Shackleton named it Caird Coast, after his principal backer. Bad weather forced the ship to shelter in the lee of a stranded iceberg.\n\nThey were now close to Luitpold Land, discovered by Filchner in 1912, at the southern end of which lay their destination, Vahsel Bay. Next day, the ship was forced north-westward for , resuming in a generally southerly direction before being stopped altogether. The position was 76° 34′S, 31° 30′W. After ten days of inactivity, the ship's fires were banked to save fuel. Strenuous efforts were made to release her; on 14 February, Shackleton ordered men onto the ice with ice-chisels, prickers, saws and picks, to try and force a passage, but the labour proved futile. Shackleton did not at this stage abandon all hope of breaking free, but was now contemplating the \"possibility of having to spend a winter in the inhospitable arms of the pack\".\n\nOn 21 February 1915, \"Endurance\", still held fast, drifted to her most southerly latitude, 76° 58′S. Thereafter she began moving with the pack in a northerly direction. On 24 February, Shackleton realised that they would be held in the ice throughout the winter, and ordered ship's routine abandoned. The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice-kennels or \"dogloos\", and the ship's interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men—officers, scientists, engineers, and seamen. A wireless apparatus was rigged, but their location was too remote to receive or transmit signals.\n\nShackleton was aware of the recent example of Wilhelm Filchner's ship, the \"Deutschland\", which had become icebound in the same vicinity three years earlier. After Filchner's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed, his ship \"Deutschland\" was trapped on 6 March 1912, about off the coast of Coats Land. Six months later, at latitude 63° 37', the ship broke free, then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal. Shackleton thought that a similar experience might allow \"Endurance\" to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring.\n\nIn February and March, the rate of drift was very slow. At the end of March Shackleton calculated that the ship had travelled a mere since 19 January. However, as winter set in the speed of the drift increased, and the condition of the surrounding ice changed. On 14 April, Shackleton recorded the nearby pack \"piling and rafting against the masses of ice\"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance \"she would be crushed like an eggshell\". In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75° 23′S, 42° 14′W, still drifting northwards. It would be at least four months before spring brought the chance of an opening of the ice, and there was no certainty that \"Endurance\" would break free in time to attempt a return to the Vahsel Bay area. Shackleton now considered the possibility of finding an alternative landing ground on the western shores of the Weddell Sea, if that coast could be reached. \"In the meantime\", he wrote, \"we must wait\".\n\nIn the dark winter months of May, June and July, Shackleton was concerned to maintain fitness, training and morale. Although the scope for activity was limited, the dogs were exercised (and on occasion raced competitively), men were encouraged to take moonlight walks, and aboard ship there were attempted theatricals. Special occasions such as Empire Day were duly celebrated. The first signs of the ice breaking up occurred on 22 July. On 1 August, in a south-westerly gale with heavy snow, the ice floe began to disintegrate all around the ship, the pressure forcing masses of ice beneath the keel and causing a heavy list to port. The position was perilous; Shackleton wrote: \"The effects of the pressure around us was awe-inspiring. Mighty blocks of ice [...] rose slowly till they jumped like cherry-stones gripped between thumb and finger [...] if the ship was once gripped firmly her fate would be sealed\". This danger passed, and the succeeding weeks were quiet. During this relative lull the ship drifted into the area where, in 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell of the sealer \"Wasp\" reported seeing a coastline which he identified as \"New South Greenland\". There was no sign of any such land; Shackleton concluded that Morrell had been deceived by the presence of large icebergs.\n\nOn 30 September, the ship sustained what Shackleton described as \"the worst squeeze we had experienced\". Worsley described the pressure as like being \"thrown to and fro like a shuttlecock a dozen times\". On 24 October, the starboard side was forced against a large floe, increasing the pressure until the hull began to bend and splinter, so that water from below the ice began to pour into the ship. When the timbers broke they made noises which sailors later described as being similar to the sound of \"heavy fireworks and the blasting of guns\". The supplies and three lifeboats were transferred to the ice, while the crew attempted to shore up the ship's hull and pump out the incoming sea, but after a few days, on 27 October 1915, and in freezing temperatures below , Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship. The position at abandonment was 69° 05′S, 51° 30′W. The wreckage remained afloat, and over the following weeks the crew salvaged further supplies and materials, including Hurley's photographs and cameras that had initially been left behind. From around 550 plates, Hurley chose the best 150, the maximum that could be carried, and smashed the rest.\n\nWith the loss of the ship the transcontinental plans were abandoned, and the focus shifted to that of survival. Shackleton's intention now was to march the crew westward, to one or other of several possible destinations. His first thought was for Paulet Island, where he knew there was a hut containing a substantial food depot, because he had ordered it 12 years earlier while organising relief for Otto Nordenskjöld's stranded Swedish expedition. Other possibilities were Snow Hill Island, which had been Nordenskiöld's winter quarters and which was believed to contain a stock of emergency supplies, or Robertson Island. Shackleton believed that from one of these islands they would be able to reach and cross Graham Land, and get to the whaling outposts in Wilhelmina Bay. He calculated that on the day \"Endurance \" was abandoned they were from Paulet Island. Worsley calculated the distance to Snow Hill Island to be , with a further to Wilhelmina Bay. He believed the march was too risky; they should wait until the ice carried them to open water, and then escape in the boats. Shackleton over-ruled him.\n\nBefore the march could begin, Shackleton ordered the weakest animals to be shot, including the carpenter Harry McNish's cat, Mrs Chippy, and a pup which had become a pet of the surgeon Macklin. The company set out on 30 October 1915, with two of the ship's lifeboats carried on sledges. Problems quickly arose, as the condition of the sea ice around them worsened. According to Hurley the surface became \"a labyrinth of hummocks and ridges\", in which barely a square yard was smooth. In three days, the party managed to travel barely , and on 1 November, Shackleton abandoned the march; they would make camp and await the break-up of the ice. They gave the name \"Ocean Camp\" to the flat and solid-looking floe on which their aborted march had ended, and settled down to wait. Parties continued to revisit the \"Endurance\" wreck, which was still drifting with the ice a short distance from the camp. More of the abandoned supplies were retrieved until, on 21 November, the ship finally slipped beneath the ice.\nThe ice was not drifting fast enough to be noticeable, although by late November the speed was up to a day. By 5 December, they had passed 68°S, but the direction was turning slightly east of north. This was taking them to a position from which it would be difficult to reach Snow Hill Island, although Paulet Island, further north, remained a possibility. It was about away, and Shackleton was anxious to reduce the length of the lifeboat journey that would be necessary to reach it. Therefore, on 21 December he announced a second march, to begin on 23 December.\n\nConditions, however, had not improved since the earlier attempt. Temperatures had risen and it was uncomfortably warm, with men sinking to their knees in soft snow as they struggled to haul the boats through the pressure ridges. On 27 December, carpenter Harry McNish rebelled and refused to work. He argued that Admiralty law had lapsed since \"Endurance\"s sinking, and that he was no longer under orders. Shackleton's firm remonstrance finally brought the carpenter to heel, but the incident was never forgotten. Two days later, with only progress achieved in seven back-breaking days, Shackleton called a halt, observing: \"It would take us over three hundred days to reach the land\". The crew put up their tents and settled into what Shackleton called \"Patience Camp\", which would be their home for more than three months.\n\nSupplies were now running low. Hurley and Macklin were sent back to Ocean Camp to recover food that had been left there to lighten the sledging teams’ burden. On 2 February 1916, Shackleton sent a larger party back, to recover the third lifeboat. Food shortages became acute as the weeks passed, and seal meat, which had added variety to their diet, now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations. In January, all but two teams of the dogs (whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months) were shot on Shackleton's orders, because the dogs' requirements for seal meat were excessive. The final two teams were shot on 2 April, by which time their meat was a welcome addition to the rations. Meanwhile, the rate of drift became erratic; after being held at around 67° for several weeks, at the end of January there was a series of rapid north-eastward movements which, by 17 March, brought Patience Camp to the latitude of Paulet Island, but to its east. \"It might have been six hundred for all the chance we had of reaching it across the broken sea-ice\", Shackleton recorded.\n\nThe party now had land more or less continuously in sight. The peak of Mount Haddington on James Ross Island remained in view as the party drifted slowly by. They were too far north for Snow Hill or Paulet Island to be accessible, and Shackleton's chief hopes were now fixed on two remaining small islands at the northern extremity of Graham Land. These were Clarence and Elephant Island, around due north of their position on 25 March. He then decided Deception Island might be a better target destination. This lay far to the west, toward the South Shetland Islands, but Shackleton thought it might be attainable by island-hopping. Its advantage was that it was sometimes visited by whalers, and might contain provisions, whereas Clarence Island and Elephant Island were desolate and unvisited. To reach any of these destinations would require a perilous journey in the lifeboats, once the floe upon which they were drifting finally broke up. Earlier, the lifeboats had been named after the expedition's three chief financial sponsors: \"James Caird\", \"Dudley Docker\" and \"Stancomb Wills\".\n\nThe end of Patience Camp was signalled on the evening of 8 April, when the floe suddenly split. The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice; a break-up of this would mean disaster, so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party's enforced departure. He had now decided they would try, if possible, to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers. This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat. \n\nAt 1 p.m. on 9 April, the \"Dudley Docker\" was launched, and an hour later all three boats were away. Shackleton himself commanded the \"James Caird\", Worsley the \"Dudley Docker\", and navigating officer Hubert Hudson was nominally in charge of the \"Stancomb Wills\", though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was Tom Crean.\n\nThe boats were surrounded by ice, dependent upon leads of water opening up, and progress was perilous and erratic. Frequently the boats were tied to floes, or dragged up onto them, while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve. Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations, and on 12 April, rejected the various island options and decided on Hope Bay, at the very tip of Graham Land. However, conditions in the boats, in temperatures sometimes as low as , with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater, were wearing the men down, physically and mentally. Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island, the nearest of the possible refuges, was now the most practical option.\n\nOn 14 April, the boats lay off the south-east coast of Elephant Island, but could not land as the shore consisted of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers. Next day the \"James Caird\" rounded the eastern point of the island, to reach the northern lee shore, and discovered a narrow shingle beach. Soon afterwards, the three boats, which had been separated during the previous night, were reunited at this landing place. It was apparent from high tide markings that this beach would not serve as a long-term camp, so the next day Wild and a crew set off in the \"Stancomb Wills\" to explore the coast for a safer site. They returned with news of a long spit of land, to the west. With minimum delay the men returned to the boats and transferred to this new location, which they later christened Cape Wild.\n\nElephant Island was remote, uninhabited, and rarely visited by whalers or any other ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be necessary to summon help. The only realistic way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition of many of his party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.\n\nShackleton selected the boat party: himself, Worsley as navigator, Crean, McNish, Vincent and McCarthy. On instructions from Shackleton, McNish immediately set about adapting the \"James Caird\", improvising tools and materials. Frank Wild was to be left in charge of the Elephant Island party, with instructions to make for Deception Island the following spring, should Shackleton not return. Shackleton took supplies for only four weeks, knowing that if land had not been reached within that time the boat would be lost.\n\nThe \"James Caird\" was launched on 24 April 1916. The success of the voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations that would have to be made in the most unfavourable of conditions. The prevailing wind was helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May, a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in 26 years at sea. On 8 May, South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.\n\nThe arrival of the \"James Caird\" at King Haakon Bay was followed by a period of rest and recuperation, while Shackleton pondered the next move. The populated whaling stations of South Georgia lay on the northern coast. To reach them would mean either another boat journey around the island, or a land crossing through its unexplored interior. The condition of the \"James Caird\", and the physical state of the party, particularly Vincent and McNish, meant that the crossing was the only realistic option.\n\nAfter five days, the party took the boat a short distance eastwards, to the head of a deep bay which would be the starting point for the crossing. Shackleton, Worsley and Crean would undertake the land journey, the others remaining at what they christened \"Peggotty Camp\", to be picked up later after help had been obtained from the whaling stations. A storm on 18 May delayed their start, but by two o'clock the following morning the weather was clear and calm, and an hour later the crossing party set out.. \n\nTheir destination was the whaling station at Stromness, which had been the last port of call of the on their outbound journey. This was roughly away, across the edge of the Allardyce Range. Another whaling station was known to be at Prince Olav Harbour, just north of Peggotty Camp over easier terrain, but as far as the party was aware, this was only inhabited during the summer months. Shackleton and his men did not know that during their two-year absence in Antarctica, the station's owners had begun year-round operations.\n\nWithout a map, the route they chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to and could see the northern coast. They were above Possession Bay, which meant they would need to move eastward to reach Stromness. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge. There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge.\n\nEarly next morning, 20 May, seeing Husvik Harbour below them, they knew that they were on the right path. At seven o'clock in the morning, they heard the steam whistle sound from Stromness, \"the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914\". After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety. Shackleton wrote afterwards: \"I have no doubt that Providence guided us ... I know that during that long and racking march of 36 hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers it seemed to me often that we were four, not three\". This image of a fourth traveller—echoed in the accounts of Worsley and Crean—was taken up by T. S. Eliot in his poem \"The Waste Land\".\n\nShackleton's first task, on arriving at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up. A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the \"James Caird\" party were safe.\n\nIt took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, \"The Southern Sky\", which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some from their destination. \"The Southern Sky\" was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.\n\nOn reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, \"Instituto de Pesca No. 1\", which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner \"Emma\". McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. After problems arose in identifying this glacier, a nearby ice rise was renamed the McDonald Ice Rumples.\n\nBy now it was mid-August, more than three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island. Shackleton begged the Chilean Government to lend him , a small steam tug that had assisted \"Emma\" during the previous attempt. They agreed; on 25 August, \"Yelcho\"—captained by Luis Pardo–set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 a.m. on 30 August, the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.\n\nAfter Shackleton left with the \"James Caird\", Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \"Snuggery\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.\n\nWild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, the storekeeper, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.\n\nAs the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.\n\nBy 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship, food supplies were running out and no penguins were coming ashore. Orde-Lees wrote: \"We shall have to eat the one who dies first [...] there's many a true word said in jest\". Wild's thoughts were now seriously turning to the possibility of a boat trip to Deception Island—he planned to set out on 5 October, in the hoping of meeting a whaling ship— when, on 30 August 1916, the ordeal ended suddenly with the appearance of Shackleton and \"Yelcho\".\n\n\"Aurora\" left Hobart on 24 December 1914, having been delayed in Australia by financial and organizational problems. The arrival in McMurdo Sound on 15 January 1915 was later in the season than planned, but the party's commander Aeneas Mackintosh made immediate plans for a depot-laying journey on the Ross Ice Shelf, since he understood that Shackleton hoped to attempt the crossing during that first season. Neither the men nor the dogs were acclimatised, and the party was, as a whole, very inexperienced in ice conditions. The first journey on the ice resulted in the loss of ten of the party's 18 dogs and a frostbitten and generally demoralised shore party; a single, incomplete depot was their only achievement.\n\nOn 7 May, \"Aurora\", anchored at the party's Cape Evans headquarters, was wrenched from her moorings during a gale and carried with drifting ice far out to sea. Unabled to return to McMurdo Sound, she remained captive in the ice for nine months until on 12 February 1916, having travelled a distance of around , she reached open water and limped to New Zealand. She carried with her the greater part of the shore party's fuel, food rations, clothing and equipment, although the sledging rations for the depots had been landed ashore. To continue with its mission the stranded shore party had to re-supply and re-equip itself from the leftovers from earlier expeditions, notably Captain Scott's Terra Nova Expedition which had been based at Cape Evans a few years earlier. They were thus able to begin the second season's depot-laying on schedule, in September 1915.\n\nIn the following months, the required depots were laid, at one-degree intervals across the Ross Ice Shelf to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier. On the return journey from the glacier the party was attacked by scurvy; Arnold Spencer-Smith, the expedition's chaplain and photographer, collapsed and died on the ice. The remainder of the party reached the temporary shelter of Hut Point, a relic of the \"Discovery Expedition\" at the southern end of McMurdo Sound, where they slowly recovered. On 8 May 1916, Mackintosh and Victor Hayward decided to walk across the unstable sea ice to Cape Evans, were caught in a blizzard, and were not seen again. The survivors eventually reached Cape Evans, but then had to wait for eight further months. Finally, on 10 January 1917, the repaired and refitted \"Aurora\", whose departure from New Zealand had been delayed by lack of money, arrived to transport them back to civilization;. Shackleton accompanied the ship as a supernumerary officer, having been denied command by the governments of New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain who had jointly organised and financed the Ross Sea party's relief.\n\nThe rescued party, having had its last contact with civilization in 1914, was unaware of the course of the Great War. News of Shackleton's safe arrival in the Falklands briefly eclipsed war news in the British newspapers on 2 June 1916. The expedition returned home in piecemeal fashion, at a critical stage in the war, without the normal honours and civic receptions. When Shackleton himself finally arrived in England on 29 May 1917, after a short American lecture tour, his return was barely noticed.\n\nDespite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the \"James Caird\" voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were John Vincent, William Stephenson and Ernest Holness. Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service. Before the war ended, two—Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham—had been killed in action, and Ernest Wild of the Ross Sea party had died of typhoid while serving in the Mediterranean. Several others were severely wounded, and many received decorations for gallantry. Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires, Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in Murmansk, with the Army rank of Major. This occupied him until March 1919. He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition, the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition on , which left London on 17 September 1921. From the \"Endurance\" crew, Wild, Worsley, Macklin, McIlroy, Hussey, Alexander Kerr, Thomas McLeod and cook Charles Green, all sailed with \"Quest\".\n\nShackleton died of a heart attack on 5 January 1922, while \"Quest\" was anchored at South Georgia. After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions made it impossible for them to land.\n\nIt would be more than 40 years before the first crossing of Antarctica was achieved, by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955–1958. This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay, following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the Skelton Glacier. The entire journey took 98 days.\n\n\n"}

It belongs to the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Bad Sobernheim, whose seat is in the like-named town. Nußbaum is a winegrowing village.\n\nNußbaum lies in the valley of the River Nahe. The municipal area measures 591 ha.\n\nClockwise from the north, Nußbaum's neighbours are the municipalities of Daubach, Bockenau (although this boundary is only several metres long) and Waldböckelheim, the town of Bad Sobernheim, the municipalities of Meddersheim and Monzingen and the town of Bad Sobernheim again, all of which likewise lie within the Bad Kreuznach district. Nußbaum borders on Bad Sobernheim twice because that town's municipal area is in two geographically separate pieces with Nußbaum lying right between them. The actual townsite lies to the southeast while the part to the northwest is mainly rural.\n\nAlso belonging to Nußbaum is the outlying homestead of “In der Bein”.\n\nThe earliest traces of human habitation in what is now Nußbaum come from an ice-age supply camp from the Late Stone Age. In a building excavation in 1996, local historians discovered remnants of a fireplace in which there were reindeer antler fragments and bones, believed to have been from horses. Stone tools were also found, blade fragments among other things, at the site of this archaeological find, which lies about one kilometre south of the village. In 1295, Nußbaum had its first documentary mention and was until 1400 the knightly seat of the Knights of Nußbaum, who were vassals to the Counts of Sponheim. In the War of the Succession of Landshut (1504-1505), Nußbaum was all but utterly burnt down in 1504, as were many other places, and was only built anew from the few remnants of the old village one hundred years later. The church with its massive 13th-century steeple is used by both Catholics and Evangelicals, while the “tower with bells and rope” is the secular municipality's property. In the 18th century, the emperor granted one of Count Palatine Carl-Theodor's sons the title Count of Bretzenheim. Carl-Theodor had the \"Nußbaumer Schloß\" newly built for him, which still stands today and is under private ownership.\n\nNußbaum's population development since Napoleonic times is shown in the table below. The figures for the years from 1871 to 1987 are drawn from census data:\nAs at 30 November 2013, there are 458 full-time residents in Nußbaum, and of those, 280 are Evangelical (61.135%), 103 are Catholic (22.489%), 3 (0.655%) belong to other religious groups and 72 (15.721%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.\n\nThe council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nNußbaum's mayor is Kurt Greulach.\n\nThe German blazon reads: \"In Gold ein schwarzer Schrägbalken, beseitet von je einer schwarzen Leiste, belegt mit einem grünen Schildchen, darin eine goldene Haselnuss\".\n\nThe municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Or a bend cotticed sable surmounted by an inescutcheon vert charged with a hazelnut slipped palewise of the first.\n\nThe underlying composition of the shield with the bend cotticed (slanted stripe flanked by two narrower stripes) was drawn from a seal used by the knight Sir Emmerich von Nußbaum (1385). The inescutcheon with the hazelnut is a canting element for the village's name (“Nußbaum” means “nut tree” in German).\n\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate’s Directory of Cultural Monuments:\n\nNußbaum's \"Schloss\" is still under private ownership today, and may not be visited by the public. An interesting curiosity, however, is offered by the local shared church. Built in the 13th century and renovated in the 17th, it was divided as a result of religious disagreements into three in 1880. A wall was then built down the middle and a second doorway was knocked through, and ever since, when arriving for services, Protestants have entered the church through the lefthand door while Catholics have entered through the righthand one. The third division came about over a further disagreement as to who should own the upper floor, the steeple and the bells. This was settled by turning them over to the municipality's ownership.\n\nBending at a sharp angle through Nußbaum is \"Kreisstraße\" 19, which within the village forms Mühlenstraße and part of Hauptstraße. To the south, this leads to \"Bundesstraße\" 41 on the municipality's outskirts. Going eastwards, that leads to neighbouring Bad Sobernheim, and farther on to Rüdesheim an der Nahe and the district seat, Bad Kreuznach. Going westwards, the highway leads to Simmertal and eventually Idar-Oberstein. Also going westwards, \"Kreisstraße\" 19 leads to neighbouring Monzingen, serving which is a railway station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen–Saarbrücken).\n\nSince 1996, the homoeopathic pharmaceutical company Hevert-Arzneimittel has had its head office in Nußbaum, employing almost 40 workers. Since the company was founded in 1956 by Dorothea and Emil Hevert, it has been an independent family business. After having been headed by Dr. Wolfgang Hevert, the company is now headed by the third generation in the person of Mathias Hevert.\n\nNußbaum wine ripens on a vineyard area of 20 ha in the individual winegrowing locations – \"Einzellagen\" – of “Rotfeld”, “Höllenberg” and “Sonnenberg”. One winegrowing family, the Family Müller, have been plying their craft since 1588. Manfred Müller now also makes Sekt, which was formerly shaken by hand, although machines now do this job.\n\n"}

It is one of the few Canon photo lenses that are parfocal. \n\nThe 17–40mm is the least expensive of Canon's current wide-angle zooms for full-frame bodies, with the EF 16–35mm 4L IS USM and EF 11–24mm 4L USM being more expensive, and the EF 16–35mm 2.8L USM being both faster and more expensive. Weighing 475 g and measuring 83.5 mm x 96.8 mm, it is a popular choice with many photographers because of its light and compact size. A member of the L-series, the 17–40mm is a good substitute for the 16–35mm 2.8 lens, which is heavier and costs approximately twice as much. Canon now sells an image-stabilized 16–35mm 4 lens for about $300 more than the 17–40.\n\nThis lens is also a popular step up from the stock kit lens on many of Canon's EOS Digital family of cameras, the EF-S 18–55mm 3.5–5.6, for those still wanting a wide angle lens.

The written histories of the battle are specific in stating that there were only two cannon at the battle, both British \"four pounders.\"\n\nThough the battles of Lexington and Concord took place months earlier, and are historically more memorable, the Battle of Great Bridge can be seen as the first strategically important colonial victory over the British, forcing Lord Dunmore's 200 redcoats to evacuate Fort Murray and withdraw to Norfolk.\n\nThe city hall as well as other major municipal buildings for Chesapeake lie within Great Bridge. Great Bridge was essentially a small town or crossroads until the late 1980s and 1990s, when it experienced significant growth.

It once again featured Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield. The special was first broadcast October 26, 1984 on CBS. It has been released on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD home video.\n\nThis is the third of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991. In this special, Garfield, Jon and Odie go camping.\n\nGarfield is living in a boring, black and white world, claiming that all the color has gone out of his life (which explains the subtitle at the beginning: \"Please do not adjust your sets; all the color has temporarily gone out of Garfield's life\"). Jon agrees that all the color has gone and suggests a vacation as a remedy. The color suddenly comes back into Garfield's life. He is excited that Jon wants to take him and Odie on vacation, where he imagines himself in places such as Acapulco, Honolulu and Venice. After realizing that each destination has its drawbacks, Garfield concludes it doesn't matter because they won't be staying home. This joy is short-lived once Jon announces that they're going camping, but Jon forces Garfield to go.\n\nAfter a long, exhausting journey (from Garfield's point of view), the trio arrives at the campgrounds to check in, while Garfield immediately takes a dislike to one of the camp rangers for insulting him. After a few shenanigans at their campsite, including placing a live fish in the coffee pot, Jon finally gets his new \"super deluxe\" tent set up, although the result doesn't really match the ad. Unlike Jon, who is very enthusiastic about it, Garfield doesn't take to the outdoors, stating that \"it would be greater if it were inside\". As night falls, the trio listen to the radio which is interrupted by a news bulletin about a panther that has escaped from a local zoo earlier that morning and been reported in the Lake Woebegone area. Right after this news on the radio, the announcer says: \"We now return to our regular broadcast of \"fun\" music.\" (It then plays \"So Long Old Friend\" from the first Garfield TV special.) Believing the news, Garfield is terrified and wants to leave, but Jon assures him that Lake Woebegone is miles from their location and that they're perfectly safe. Following the announcement, Jon sings an old campfire song that his mother used to sing called \"Camping is my Life\" (while Garfield and Odie endure his banjo playing) before the trio goes to bed. After they go into their tent, on the hilltops, the panther comes out and growls as it eyes their campsite.\n\nThe next day, Odie wakes Jon up at the crack of dawn by licking his feet. This sends Jon rolling down the hill into the lake while still in his tent with Garfield in tow. At Garfield's suggestion that he \"go and play with something poisonous\", Odie runs into the nearby woods, passing a sign that reveals the woods to be Lake Woebegone, where the panther is lurking. The forest rangers are hunting for the panther, and attempt to warn Jon to evacuate, but after finding no one there, leave a note and move on. This proves unfortunate as a gust of wind kicks up after they leave, tossing the message into a recently extinguished campfire, where it burns up. Despite not hearing a man-eating beast growling in the night, Jon does find out that Garfield and Odie (to a lesser extent) have eaten all the food for the week, except for the dried fruit, and goes off on a tirade. Meanwhile, Garfield heads through the woods to wait for the heat to die down. While there, he starts to appreciate the beauty of nature, until he meets two forest animals named Dicky Beaver and Billy Bunny who warn Garfield about the escaped panther, claiming it has already attacked other forest animals. Odie appears, after scaring all but Garfield away by accident, and the two eavesdrop on the two rangers passing by with a tranquilizer gun, hoping to capture the panther. The first ranger wishes that he had a weapon more powerful than his tranquilizer gun to hunt the panther with, but the second ranger assures him that one of the tranquilizer darts will be enough to knock out the panther. Garfield and Odie decide that now is the time to collect Jon and leave before they are possibly attacked by the beast, and the two run all the way back to the campsite.\n\nUpon their return, Garfield tries to warn Jon of the danger, but Jon doesn't understand the warning (as Garfield can't talk), insisting that they have dried fruit and refuses to move. Garfield tries desperately to convince Odie to get into the car, warning Odie that they will be dead if they don't leave right away. However, the full moon comes into view and shines down on the camp, revealing that the panther has now entered their campsite and is approaching the trio as they look on in horror. Garfield runs up a tree while Jon and Odie hide in the tent, followed by the Jon's car as the panther tears the tent to shreds and then manages to break into the vehicle by smashing through a window. Scared but unable to watch his family being killed, Garfield leaps from the tree and takes on the panther, clawing at its head and neck, only to be shaken off. Garfield is in serious danger until the park rangers enter the campsite and subdue the beast with a tranquilizer dart. Jon congratulates Garfield for being a hero. The rangers come by and tell Jon that they were heroes too for saving Garfield from the panther, because if they hadn't made it there on time or if the dart had missed the panther, Garfield, Jon, and Odie would have been killed. Jon then announces that he feels they have had enough adventure and recommends they break camp and return to civilization, much to Garfield's joy. The rangers return the panther to the zoo, while Garfield, Jon, and Odie set off for home with Garfield bragging over how he took on the panther, as well as struggling to say, \"When the going gets tough, the tough get going.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bellevue has 1632 students enrolled in grades 9 through 12.\n\nThe school principal is Dr. Victor J. Anderson. The school's mascot is the wolverine.\n\nBellevue High School generally serves students in Bellevue School District's West Zone, which includes the towns of Medina, Yarrow Point, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point and Beaux Arts, and the neighborhoods of Enatai, Woodridge, Wilburton and Downtown Bellevue.\n\nBellevue High School's history can be traced back to 1923, when it first became an accredited four-year high school. Classes were held in a two-room school built in 1892 at the southeast corner of 100th Avenue and Main Street. It was at this location that \"The Beacon\" (the school annual) and \"The Barque\" (the student newspaper) began publication in 1925 and 1926, respectively.\n\nFrom 1930 until 1949, the school was located on 102nd Avenue Northeast between Northeast 1st and 4th Streets, a site which is now part of Bellevue Downtown Park. The school was known as \"Overlake\" High School during part of this era. Bellevue's award-winning chapter of the Future Farmers of America formed an important part of student and community life until the area's rapid urbanization led to the chapter disbanding in 1950.\n\nThe high school moved once again in January 1949 to its current hilltop campus on Kilmarnock Street (renamed \"Wolverine Way\" as the result of a campaign led by the Class of 2000). The Bellevue Memorial Athletic Field opened on September 15 of the following year, dedicated to \"the men and women of the Overlake area, living and dead, who faithfully served their country at home and abroad during World War II.\" The building underwent four major additions and renovations between 1952 and 1978. By the late 2000s, school officials felt that the heating and lighting systems, the Performing Arts Center, and the building in general were outdated; in June 2010, Bellevue High began a major construction project to address these concerns. Designed by NAC Architecture, the project was a phased addition and modernization to the 1949 school, building new academic classrooms, commons, administration and library before demolishing most of the existing facilities, leaving only the PE and athletic facilities to be modernized. A new performing arts center with music and drama classrooms and new parking lots were built where the existing structures were removed. In order to maintain a sense of continuity and respect for the legacy of the school, the red brick and elements of the original design are reinterpreted in the new building.\n\n\"Newsweek\" magazine has ranked Bellevue High School among the best public and private high schools in the nation since it initiated its ranking of U.S. high schools in 2003 as measured by the number of AP tests taken divided by the number of seniors. The subsequent publicity resulted in the school reaching its building population limit and closing the formerly open enrollment policy. For the 2007–2008 school year, only students living within its zones may newly enroll.\n\nBellevue High School also has a number of special vocational programs in areas such as automotive technology, as well as a class that is responsible for the KASB radio station.\n\nThe largest extracurricular organization at Bellevue is Key Club, with over 100 members. The chapter is part of Pacific Northwest Division 28, which is the largest division in the Pacific Northwest and has a record of winning the Spirit Award at district conventions.\n\nMany other clubs at the school are noteworthy, such as the DECA Team which has won Nationals three times and the school's dedicated FIRST Robotics Team which has won the district competition in 2008. Bellevue high school also has a chess team, who won the 2018 WA State High School Team Chess Championship. A campus tradition is Soup 4 Simpson, a charity event that happens every year to donate money to homeless shelters.\n\nThe Bellevue High School Band program has also received national recognition. The 2016-2017 jazz band was selected as finalists for the Swing Central Jazz Festival in Savannah, Georgia, where twelve of the nation’s top bands are invited. They have also been selected for the Hot Java Cool Jazz Concert, which features live sets by award-winning jazz bands from five local high schools.\n\nBellevue has 20 varsity teams and 45 other teams that provide a range of team and individual sports. The school has won state titles in multiple individual and team sports including boys and girls cross country, lacrosse, tennis, soccer, swimming, water polo, track, wrestling, and football, as well as several team academic championships. Of particular note is Bellevue's Girls swim and dive team whose 2007 3A Championship represents its sixth in seven years, and seventh in nine years.\n\nBellevue's football team has gained significant attention, winning the Washington State 3A championship 11 times between 2001 and 2013 Under the coaching of Butch Goncharoff, Although there have been multiple calls to move the school to Class 4A, the school has refused. The team has become nationally recognized according to USAToday for its precision use of the Wing T offense.\n\nThe Bellevue football team's 67 game win streak ended in with a 35-13 defeat by Eastside Catholic in the 2014 Class 3A state championship game.\n\nThe 2004 Bellevue team finished the season ranked No. 8 in the nation by \"USA Today\" and ended De La Salle High School's record 151 game winning streak. The 2004 team went on to win their fourth consecutive state title, a Washington State record for large schools, and completing a 51 win, 2 loss span, led by Washington State Player of the Year J.R. Hasty as well as first team all-state players E.J. Savannah, Stephen Schilling, Connor Mawhinney, and Keith Rosenburg. Other Bellevue players to receive Associated Press First Team all-state honors during the 4 consecutive title streak include Gavin Smith, Pat Mutzel, Jay Johnson, Jeff Dicks, Matt Coombs, Mike Braund, and Lee Driftmier.\n\nBellevue's 2008 state 3A football championship was the school's sixth state championship in eight years and seventh state football championship in school history. Prior to winning the 2008 state championship, the Bellevue football team was involved in a rollover bus crash several hours prior to playing the Capital Cougars (Olympia, WA) in the state semi-finals in the Tacoma Dome. The accident delayed the game for three days as the Bellevue Wolverines went on to defeat the Cougars in the state semi-finals. Bellevue holds multiple other Washington State records including the record for most consecutive championship tournament wins at 17. The 2009 team went on and had a 12–2 record and again won the WIAA 3A state title. In 2010, the Bellevue Wolverines won the state 3A football championship for a 3rd straight year (and 8 out of the previous 10 years), defeating Kamiakin High School 38–0 in the championship game.\n\nOn May 26, 2012, the boys track and field team won the Class 3A state title, winning the 400 and 1600 meter relays en route to a 20-point victory over second place Lakes High School. Bellevue again won the boys track and field state championship in 2013, 2014 and 2015, making it four years in a row.\n\nBellevue's 2010 Varsity Lacrosse team beat Mercer Island 5–4 in over time for the state title.\n\nIn 2011, the Bellevue boys water polo team beat the Newport Knights 15-8 to win the team's first ever state championship.

{"id": "2183428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183428", "title": "Nina Totenberg", "text": "Nina Totenberg\n\nNina Totenberg (born January 14, 1944) is an American legal affairs correspondent for National Public Radio (NPR) focusing primarily on the activities and politics of the Supreme Court of the United States. Her reports air regularly on NPR's newsmagazines \"All Things Considered, Morning Edition\", and \"Weekend Edition\". From 1992 to 2013, she was also a panelist on the syndicated TV political commentary show \"Inside Washington\".\n\n\"Newsweek\" magazine called her \"the creme de la creme\" of NPR , and \"Vanity Fair\" refers to her as \"Queen of the Leaks\". She has won many broadcast journalism awards for both her explanatory pieces and her scoops.\n\nAmong her scoops was her groundbreaking report of sexual harassment allegations made against Clarence Thomas by University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill, leading the Senate Judiciary Committee to re-open Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Previously, in 1986, she broke the story that Supreme Court nominee Douglas H. Ginsburg had smoked marijuana, leading Ginsburg to withdraw his name. And in 1977, she reported on secret Supreme Court deliberations relating to the Watergate scandal.\n\nNina Totenberg was born in New York, the eldest daughter of violinist Roman Totenberg, who was born in Poland, and Melanie (Shroder) Totenberg, who was a real estate broker. She is the widow of U.S. Senator Floyd K. Haskell (D-Colorado), whom she married in 1979. She remarried in 2000 to H. David Reines, a trauma surgeon and Vice Chairman of Surgery at Inova Fairfax Hospital. On their honeymoon, he treated her for severe injuries after she was hit by a boat propeller while swimming. In March 2010, Totenberg's sister Amy Totenberg was nominated by President Barack Obama to the U.S. District Court in Atlanta. Amy Totenberg was confirmed the next year. Another sister, Jill Totenberg, is a businesswoman married to Brian Foreman. On August 6, 2015, the Ames Stradivarius, which had been stolen from their father 35 years earlier, was returned to the three sisters.\n\nTotenberg enrolled in Boston University in 1962, majoring in journalism, but dropped out less than three years later because, in her own words, she \"wasn’t doing brilliantly\". Soon after dropping out of college, Totenberg began her journalism career at the \"Boston Record American\", where she worked on the Women's Page and learned breaking news journalism skills by volunteering in the news department. She moved on to the \"Peabody Times\" in Massachusetts and \"Roll Call\" in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt the \"National Observer\", Totenberg began covering legal affairs. In 1971 she broke a story about a secret list of candidates President Richard Nixon was considering for the Supreme Court. All the candidates were later rejected as unqualified by the American Bar Association and none were nominated.\n\nAfter Totenberg wrote an \"Observer\" profile of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, the latter wrote a long letter to the paper's editor demanding she be fired. Instead, the editor printed the letter in the \"Observer\" along with a rebuttal of Hoover's complaints regarding the article.\n\nShe was fired from that paper for plagiarism in 1972 regarding a profile she wrote of then-soon-to-be Speaker Tip O'Neill which included, without attribution, quotes from members of Congress that had previously appeared in \"The Washington Post\". Totenberg has said that the dismissal also related to her rebuffing of sexual overtures from an editor. Many of Totenberg's colleagues have defended her, noting that the use of previously-reported quotes was a common journalistic practice in the 1970s. In 1995, Totenberg told the \"Columbia Journalism Review\", \"I have a strong feeling that a young reporter is entitled to one mistake and to have the holy bejeezus scared out of her to never do it again.\"\n\nShe next worked for the New York-based news magazine \"New Times\". At that publication, she wrote a celebrated article called \"The Ten Dumbest Members of Congress\", prompting the senator at the top of the list, William L. Scott, to call a press conference to deny that he was the \"dumbest member of Congress.\"\n\nIn 1975, Nina Totenberg was hired by Bob Zelnick to work at National Public Radio and has been there since.\n\nIn 1977, Totenberg broke a story about the Supreme Court appeal of three men who had been convicted in the Watergate scandal: H.R. Haldeman, John N. Mitchell, and John D. Ehrlichman. Totenberg revealed the results of their secret 5–3 vote against reviewing the case and that the three dissenters were appointees of President Richard Nixon. Nixon had resigned three years earlier, in the wake of Watergate. Totenberg also revealed that Nixon-appointed Chief Justice Warren Burger delayed announcing the results of the vote, hoping to sway his fellow justices. Her reporting of private Supreme Court deliberations was a novel development in Supreme Court reporting and led to speculation about who on the Court gave her the information.\n\nIn 1986, Totenberg broke the story that William H. Rehnquist, who was nominated for Chief Justice of the United States by Ronald Reagan, had written a memo in 1970 opposing the Equal Rights Amendment, in which he said that the amendment would \"hasten the dissolution of the family\" and that would \"virtually abolish all legal distinctions between men and women.\" The memo was written when Rehnquist was head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in the Nixon Administration.\n\nTotenberg broke the story that Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, who had been nominated to the Supreme Court by Ronald Reagan, had smoked marijuana \"on a few occasions\" during his student days in the 1960s and while an assistant professor at Harvard Law School in the 1970s, something that did not appear in Ginsburg's FBI background check. The revelations resulted in Ginsburg's withdrawing his name from consideration. Totenberg was awarded the 1988 Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton award for outstanding broadcast journalism for the story.\n\nIn 1991, a few days before a confirmation vote was scheduled for Republican George H. W. Bush's Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, Totenberg disclosed allegations of sexual harassment lodged against Thomas by University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill. Totenberg's report about Hill's allegations led the Senate Judiciary Committee to re-open Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings to consider Hill's charges.\n\nTotenberg was criticized by many of Thomas' supporters, including Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee. The Senate appointed special counsel Peter E. Fleming Jr. to investigate the leak. Totenberg and \"Newsday\"s Timothy Phelps were subpoenaed by Fleming, but refused to answer questions about their confidential sources.\n\nTotenberg was confronted by one Thomas supporter, Republican Senator Alan K. Simpson, during and after the taping of an episode of \"Nightline\". On the show, Simpson criticized Totenberg, saying \"What politicians get tired of is bias in reporters. Let's not pretend your reporting is objective here. That would be absurd.\" After Totenberg defended her reporting and objectivity on the show, Simpson followed her out of the studio and continued to criticize her, even holding open the door of her limousine so she could not leave. \"He was in a complete rage. He was out of control,\" Totenberg said. Accounts differ on Totenberg's response, but she used what she called \"choice epithets\" and said: \"I think I told him to shut the fuck up.\"\n\nFollowing Totenberg's allegation to \"The Washington Post\"s Howard Kurtz that she had been sexually harassed at the \"National Observer\", Al Hunt of \"The Wall Street Journal\" brought up the plagiarism incident in a column about media coverage of and responses to the Thomas hearings. Some observers connected Hunt's rehashing of a then nearly 20-year-old incident to the stance of the \"Journal\", whose conservative editorial pages had \"editorially championed\" Thomas and had previously criticized Totenberg, but Hunt denied any ideological motivation.\n\nFor the report and NPR's gavel-to-gavel coverage, Totenberg received the George Foster Peabody Award. The same year, she won the George Polk Award for excellence in journalism and the Joan S. Barone Award for excellence in Washington-based national affairs/public policy reporting (the latter also in part for her coverage of the retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall). The American Library Association presented her with its James Madison Award, given to those who \"championed, protected, and promoted public access to government information and the public’s right to know\". She also earned the Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for investigative reporting.\n\nIn addition to awards mentioned above, and among her other awards, Totenberg has been honored seven times by the American Bar Association for excellence in legal reporting and won the first-ever Toni House award presented by the American Judicature Society for a career body of work, and was the first radio journalist to be honored by the National Press Foundation as Broadcaster of the Year. She has written articles for the \"Harvard Law Review\" (including tributes to Justices William J. Brennan, Jr. and Lewis Powell when they retired); \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"New York\" magazine; the \"Christian Science Monitor\"; and numerous other legal and general circulation publications. She also contributed to the Jewish Women's Archive's online exhibit \"Jewish Women and the Feminist Revolution\" with regard to her reporting on Anita Hill's allegations against Clarence Thomas. In the 1990s Totenberg was a regular contributor to ABC's \"Nightline\".\n\nTotenberg played the part of an election anchor in the film \"The Distinguished Gentleman\" (1992), and also appeared briefly as herself in the Kevin Kline film \"Dave\" (1993). Her image has also been used for an item produced for NPR called \"The Nina Totin' Bag\"—a play on her name and the stereotypical tote bag offered as a thank-you gift for donating to a public broadcasting pledge drive.\n\nTotenberg has made friends with a number of politicians and lawyers in national politics, and her personal connections to these people have occasionally generated discussion. Allegations that Totenberg obtained her scoops by untoward means were prevalent early in her career, a fact Bill Kovach, editor of \"The New York Times\", attributed to sexism since she was one of the few women working in a predominantly male environment. Totenberg was criticized by some commentators for hugging her friend Lani Guinier during a press conference announcing Guinier's nomination by Bill Clinton to the post of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Media critic Howard Kurtz reported that while Totenberg said she did not intend to give special treatment to Guinier in her reporting, she had hugged her because she had not seen her in some time. Then in 2000, some journalists expressed concern that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's officiating at Totenberg's marriage could be seen as a conflict of interest. Totenberg responded she did not consider it a conflict of interest since her friendship with the jurist was established long before Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court. She also had a friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia from when he was an assistant US attorney general.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" editorialist Paul Gigot wrote in 1991 that Totenberg exhibits partisanship in her reporting. \"Washington Post\" reporter Thomas Edsall said in 1995 that she was cited as an example of liberal bias in public broadcasting due to her reporting on two controversial Supreme Court nominations.\n\nIn 1995, responding to conservative Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who characterized AIDS as a \"disease transmitted by people deliberately engaging in unnatural acts\" in his effort to cut government spending to combat it, Totenberg said: \"I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the good Lord's mind, because if there's retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion or one of his grandchildren will.\" On the same show, conservative columnists Charles Krauthammer and Tony Snow also criticized Helms, with Krauthammer calling Helms's remarks \"bigoted and cruel\" and Snow accusing him of \"hypocrisy\". Totenberg subsequently expressed regret for her choice of words, saying: \"It was a stupid remark. I'll pay for it for the rest of my life.\" Following his October 2010 firing from NPR for comments he made on FoxNews, Juan Williams said the failure of NPR to discipline her for these statements was an example of NPR's double standard, a charge echoed by Fox News and conservative pundits.\n\n\n"}

He died during a transatlantic flight trial.\n\nLudwik Idzikowski was born in Warsaw. He started mining studies in Liege, Belgium.\nAt the outbreak of World War I, he was conscripted into the Russian Army. He completed aviation school in Sevastopol, and from 1916 served in air combat units as an officer pilot. After the October Revolution he managed to return to Warsaw and in November 1918 Idzikowski joined the newly-born Polish Army, in the rank of \"podporucznik pilot\" (flying 2nd Lieutenant).\n\nIn 1919 he joined the Polish Air Force and during the Polish-Soviet War, initially flew with the 7th fighter escadre (\"Kościuszko Squadron\"), crewed mostly by American volunteers, then the 6th reconnaissance escadre. He took part, among others, in the defence of Lwów. After the war, from 1921–1923 he was an instructor, then commander of escadre training in an advanced flying school in Grudziądz. From 1924–1926 he commanded an escadre, then a squadron, in the 1st Aviation Regiment in Warsaw. \nIn April 1926, Idzikowski was sent to France with a Polish military mission, where he tested aircraft bought by the Polish government. It was then that he planned to make his first transatlantic flight, but in the more difficult and as yet, unsuccessfully attempted East-West direction. A French attempt had been made in May 1927 aboard \"The White Bird\" (\"L'Oiseau Blanc\"), but the aircraft disappeared over the Atlantic. Two weeks later, the American Charles Lindbergh made the first successful nonstop flight from New York to Paris.\n\nAfter considerable hesitation, the Polish authorities, urged on by the press, eventually succumbed and bought a special plane for a transatlantic flight from France. A long range variant of the latest bomber Amiot 123, It was named \"Marszałek Piłsudski\" (Marshal Józef Piłsudski). On January 1, 1928, Idzikowski was promoted to Major.\n\nThe second pilot and navigator chosen was Major Kazimierz Kubala. They commenced their first trials for the transatlantic flight on August 3, 1928, taking off at 4:45 a.m. from Paris Le Bourget airfield. However, after flying some 3,200 km and above the ocean, they noticed engine oil levels were falling, caused by a cracked oil tank. They decided to return to Europe, since it was more than half way to America and against the wind. After 31 hours of flight, oil depleted, Idzikowski decided to land on water by the German merchant ship \"Samos\", about 70 km from the Spanish coast. The sailors rescued the crew and pulled the aircraft from the water.\n\nIdzikowski and Kubala repeated a trial the next year. A second Amiot 123 was bought, since the old one was too badly damaged. It was named the \"White Eagle\" (according to some sources, it was named \"Marszałek Piłsudski\" as well). They took off on July 13, 1929, at 3:45 a.m. from Le Bourget. After flying 2140 km, over the ocean, about 5 p.m., an engine started to lose RPM and emit noise. They decided to land on Faial Island in the Azores. However, because of more irregular engine work, at 9 p.m. (7 p.m. local time), Idzikowski decided to make an emergency landing on a closer rocky island Graciosa. During a landing on a field, the plane hit a low stone wall and overturned, wheels up. In the crash, Ludwik Idzikowski was killed, while Kazimierz Kubala was slightly injured. During the rescue operation, the aircraft was wrecked and Idzikowski burned.\n\nIdzikowski's body was returned to Poland by the sailing ship ORP Iskra and buried with honours on August 17, 1929. He was awarded the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari, Cross of Valour (\"Krzyz Walecznych\") (three times), Gold Cross of Merit, and (posthumously) the Officer's Cross of the Polonia Restituta. He also held the Field Pilot Badge.\n\nIdzikowski was commemorated with a monument in Dąbrowa Górnicza-Tucznawa at the terrain of local Primary School.\n\n"}

He was named Charles Nicholas, but called Chas as it was a common nickname for Charles in Hackney where his father was from. He was raised in north London, and moved to Kent in the summer of 1947. His father, a lorry driver, killed himself the day before Hodges' fourth birthday. Interviewed by \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2015 he said, \"We never discovered what caused him to shoot himself with a shotgun.\" After his father's death, the family returned to Edmonton in North London to live with his grandparents, with his mother making a living playing piano in local pubs and clubs. He attended Eldon Road School, and later Edmonton Higher Grade School but left just before he was 15 at the end of 1958.\n\nHodges first became interested in Rock 'n' Roll music after listening to Little Richard on Radio Luxembourg around 1956. He was then inspired by Lonnie Donegan to learn to play the guitar when he was 12, and joined a skiffle band a year later in 1957, The Horseshoe Skiffle Group. In May 1958, he attended a Jerry Lee Lewis concert and became interesting in learning to play the piano. He worked for a while in a jeweller's shop after leaving school.\n\nHodges became a professional musician by the age of 16, playing bass guitar with various local bands until he joined Billy Gray and the Stormers in 1960. After Billy Gray and the Stormers broke up, Hodges worked with the producer Joe Meek who put Hodges and his former band together as backing band for Mike Berry, forming the Outlaws. They were later joined by Ritchie Blackmore. They also worked as session musicians, backing Jerry Lee Lewis, Bill Haley and Gene Vincent. Hodges claimed that he learnt the piano by watching Jerry Lee Lewis whilst backing him. During this time, Hodges became known as \"Sleepy\" after his habit of falling asleep during the recording process. The Outlaws broke up, and he was invited to join Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers as a bass player in 1965.\n\nHodges had known Dave Peacock for a number of years; they met in 1963 when a friend of Peacock gave Hodges a lift home and found they had similar taste in music. After the Rebel Rousers, Hodges joined Peacock, Harvey Hinsley and Mick Burt in Black Claw (three of the band would later be in Chas & Dave). In 1970, Albert Lee asked him to join a new band Heads Hands & Feet, who supported Blackmore's subsequent band Deep Purple on tour. He played bass with Purple for one show on 8 March 1971, at Music Hall Aberdeen, substituting for the regular bassist, Roger Glover who was ill. They attempted to form a new breakaway band The New Heads Hands & Feet, Lee however left to play for The Crickets, and they finished as a band.\n\nHodges toured America when he was with Heads Hands & Feet, and it was during the tour that he began to have the idea of performing in his natural accent as he thought it \"not quite real\" performing in an American accent to an American audience. When Heads Hands & Feet broke up in 1972, Hodges and Peacock considered forming a band together, singing in their own accent about things they knew. They began to perform as a duo Chas & Dave. Hodges was originally a bass player, but in Chas & Dave he played the piano and guitar while Peacock played bass. They also recorded as Oily Rags (cockney rhyming slang for cigarettes - \"fags\") with Gerry Hogan and Ian Wallace, and releasing a self-titled album in 1974. They also recorded an album with Oliver Nelson. In 1975 Hodges and Peacock played on Labi Siffre's album \"Remember My Song\". Eminem would later sample a riff from the song \"I Got The\" (featuring Hodges on guitar and Peacock on bass) on his 1999 hit \"My Name Is\".\n\nHodges and Peacock recorded their first album as Chas & Dave in 1974, and this album, \"One Fing'*'Anuvver\", was released in 1975. According to Hodges, the title track \"One Fing'*'Anuvver\" was their first Rockney song. Burt joined the duo in 1976 as a drummer. They were signed by EMI in 1978, and the album \"Rockney\" was released the same year. A song from the album, \"Strummin'\", was their first song to reach the chart. In early 1979, a song from their first album \"Woortcha!\" was used used for a notable television commercial for Courage Bitter, and the song was then re-recorded and released as a single, retitled \"Gertcha\". They opened for Led Zeppelin at the 1979 Knebworth Festival.\n\nIn 1980, Chas & Dave formed their own record label Rockney with their manager Bob England. Their first release under this label \"Rabbit\" became a top 10 hit. They had a bigger hit song in 1982 with \"Ain't No Pleasing You\", written largely by Hodges.\n\nHodges was popular amongst supporters of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club owing to singles he had released as Chas & Dave. These include \"Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur\", \"Hot Shot Tottenham!\", \"When the Year Ends in One\", \"Spurs Medley\" and \"Ossie's Dream (Spurs Are on Their Way to Wembley)\".\n\nHe also played piano for short-lived supergroup called the Rockers, which featured Roy Wood, Phil Lynott and John Coghlan.\n\nIn 2009, following the death of his wife Sue, Peacock announced his retirement from performing with Chas & Dave. However, he changed his mind the following year and announced a tour for 2011.\n\nThey also played their \"Christmas Jamboree\" at the IndigO2 in December 2011 and December 2012. They undertook a 'Back By Demand' tour of the UK between February and May 2013. In 2012, Hodges wrote and recorded a charity single with his band and 2012 Premier League Darts players called \"Got My Tickets for the Darts\". The video featured Hodges, his band, the 2012 Premier League Darts players, and walk-on girl Jacqui Adams. It was released on 18 May, the night after the play-offs at the O2 arena in London, where it was premiered, and proceeds from the single were donated to the Haven House Children's Hospice, in Woodford Green, Essex.\n\nIn 2009 Hodges released an eponymous solo album on Talking Elephant Records In 2010, he guested on an album by Vince Eager (Western Star Records) called \"788 Years of Rock n Roll\", the following year Hodges returned to the label to record a solo album titled \"Together We Made Music\". In 2014, Hodges also guested on Simon Fowler's new band Merrymouth's album, \"Wenlock Hill\", contributing piano on the song \"Salt Breeze\".\n\nHodges was a keen gardener. In 2014, he started his Rock n Roll Allotment column in the British newspaper the \"Daily Express\".\n\nOn 6 February 2017, it was announced that Hodges had been diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. A statement on social media said the illness had been caught \"at an early stage\", and that he would be undergoing treatment immediately.

They also recorded a number of songs with Tottenham Hotspur F.C., both being fans of the team; the first song they wrote for the club, \"Ossie's Dream\", was largely written by Peacock.\n\nIn 2009, following the death of his wife Sue,(Susan Heath born 1946 in Croydon married in Greenwich in 1973) Peacock announced his retirement from performing with Chas & Dave. However, in 2010 the band announced a tour for the following year. They also played their \"Christmas Jamboree\" at the IndigO2 on 23 and 24 December 2011 and 8 December 2012. After this they had a \"Back by Demand\" tour of the UK between 28 February and 16 May 2013. The double act ended with Hodges' death from pneumonia on 22 September 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The band's original lineup consisted of Bohdan X (Bodhan Kubiakowski) on guitar and vocals, Wednesday playing bass guitar, synthesizer and tapes and Johnny Crash (Janis Friedenfelds) on drums and vocals. The band took its name from the first initials of the founding members. The band relocated to Melbourne in August 1977. JAB signed to Suicide Records in January 1978, and two of their songs, \"Blonde and Bombed\" and \"Let's Go\", were included on the \"Lethal Weapons\" compilation. The band played their final show in August 1978 at the Crystal Ballroom (then known as the Seaview Ballroom), which was also the first gig ever played at the now iconic venue.\n\nWednesday, Crash and Pierre Voltaire then joined Sean Kelly (ex-Teenage Radio Stars) to form the first line-up of Models. The initial version of the group did not stay together for long as Voltaire was soon replaced on bass guitar by Mark Ferrie (ex-Myriad), then in August 1979, Wednesday was replaced by Andrew Duffield (ex-Whirlywirld) on keyboards.\n\nIn 1980 he released a solo single, \"Love By Numbers\" and produced four songs with vocalist Karen Marks (the manager of Models and JAB). That year he also joined experimental outfit The Metronomes with rock journalist Al Webb (guitar, synthesiser; ex-Streetlife)and Andrew Picouleau (bass, synthesiser; Secret Police, Sacred Cowboys), having previously been an invited guest with the band. The Metronomes released two singles, \"Saturday Night\"/\"Sunday Morning\" (1979), \"A Circuit Like Me\"/\"Closed Circuit\" (1980) and two albums, \"Multiple Choice\" (1981) and \"Regular Guys\" (1985) on the Cleopatra label. The band was never intended to be a live outfit and only ever came together in the studio. Around 2000 the members began work on a new project and after four years of sporadic effort released a new album, \"Today\". This was followed by a re-release of the band's first two albums and an EP (comprising the band's two singles), as a single release, \"The Ballad of the Metronomes\", in 2010.\n\nConcurrently Wednesday collaborated with T.E. Power (Nuv Bloc) on a project titled Thealonian Music, using the latest electronic instruments of the time. The concept being to generate music of a spontaneous nature, with the rhythmic foundation being provided by a programmable drum machine, sequence and synthesizer combination. Thealonian Music only produced one release, the 1982 tape, \"Project X Chromosome X\". Throughout the early 1980s, he was a member of Modern Jazz, an improvisation group who performed to randomly generated techno beats. Modern Jazz featured a fluid line-up that included Lyn Gordon (synthesiser), Andrew Park (synthesiser) and Ted Thornbury (vocals). The band played 1980s techno music and issued one album, \"The Nude\", on the Cleopatra label in 1986.\n\nIn 1988 he and Lyn Gordon formed electronic / industrial band Crashland, composed of Lyn Gordon (vocal, guitar), Wednesday (sampler), Ray Moore (drums) and Phil Sutherland (bass). A year after their formation, Crashland signed a deal with Regular Records which resulted in the release of their first single, \"Cherry Bomb\"/\"Elvis Working\" in October 1989. Crashland's self-titled debut album comprised half original material and half covers, was released in April 1990, together with the band's second single, a demented electro remodelling of John Lee Hooker's \"Boom Boom\"/\"On T.V.\".\n\nWednesday moved to Berlin in 1992, where he worked with Nina Hagen, being involved with pre-production and programming for her 1995 album, \"FreuD euch\" (\"Bee Happy\").\n\nIn 1997, Wednesday became a touring member of German band Einstürzende Neubauten. He completed several world tours with them and is present on their live albums, such as \"09-15-2000, Brussels\" and numerous recordings from the Perpetuum Mobile tour (2004). Eventually departing in 2013.\n\nIn 1999 he returned to Melbourne and formed The Tingler, with Crashland vocalist Lyn Gordon. The Tingler releasing a self-titled album in April 2000. The Tingler also featured on the bill during the Models 2000/2001 reunion shows.\n\nIn 2013 he was to perform solo as The Ash Wednesday Effect, a spontaneously performed audio/visual experience, in which improvised soundscapes triggered entrancing visualisation, which were in turn projected onto Wednesday's physical form. The performances at Club Voltaire, North Melbourne were continuous three-hour pieces, throughout which audience members were free to come and go as they chose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In both movies he is credited as Boogaloo Shrimp, a name that remains linked to the Hollywood phase of popping, boogaloo and robot dancing, as well as the freestyle art of b-boying. During the height of the popularity of those movies, Chambers, along with his \"Breakin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" co-star Adolfo \"Shabba Doo\" Quiñones and other dancers from the film, was prominently featured in the 1984 music video for Chaka Khan's song \"I Feel for You\". As of 2020, Chambers has been working with independent Chill-Hop artist E-Styles and is to release a website, as well as music and YouTube pages, featuring vintage and original footage from his career.\n\nBorn in Wilmington, California, Chambers is the youngest of four. He grew up in a small town, but a community with a diverse mix of ethnic groups and cultures. In 1978, while at Junior High, Chambers would see a member of the Samoan American dance group - Blue City Strutters perform; the Blue City Strutters - Danny, Paul, Ted, Jack & Charlie heavily influenced Chambers' style, performing king tut and domino routines, bringing dance styles from San Jose and San Francisco to South Bay Los Angeles. Initially, he formulated his style of dance through his interest in fantasy and sci-fi television shows, including the work of Ray Harryhausen and other stop-motion experts. He credits his older brother with introducing him to the \"moonwalk\", a move he would later perfect, and share with pop superstar Michael Jackson as well as his signature style of animated popping.\n\nWhile still a teenager, Chambers' older brother would take him to the Redondo Beach, California pier where he would perform his moves for money. He claims to have earned hundreds of dollars through his street performances. To solve the problem of anonymity, Chambers' sister gave him a jacket that read \"Mike a.k.a. Boogaloo Shrimp\", his street dancing name. Chambers' dancing would increasingly draw the attention of promoters, and particularly Adolpho \"Shabba Doo\" Quinones, who was seeking to form a new dance troupe after the breakup of his previous group, The Lockers.\n\nChambers would also meet other popping/dance legends during this time, including Bruno \"Poppin' Taco\" Falcon and Popin' Pete. Falcon and Chambers would share ideas and styles, building upon their own individual foundations . Both would later be featured in videos and movies, including \"Breakin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\".\nChambers enjoys teaching and has been invited as a speaker several times at USC`s Thorton music school and has spoken at Santa Monica college ,University of Redlands and a surprise visit to Spelman University Georgia.\n\nChambers got an early entrée into professional dancing through television commercials, followed by an appearance in the video for Lionel Richie's \"All Night Long\". He made further appearances in Chaka Khan's \"I Feel For You\", Richard Marx' \"Children of the Night\", Stay Q's \"Give You All My Love\", Paula Abdul's \"Opposites Attract\" as assistant choreographer and character of MC Skat Kat. In 1985, he co-starred in \"Stop the Madness\", an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration, featuring several famous musicians, actors and athletes. He also appeared in such films as \"\", \"Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey\" as a dancing robot and in the 1999 film \"Dudley Do-Right\". He also appeared as Urkel-Bot in two episodes, \"Robo-Nerd\" and Robo-Nerd II\", of \"Family Matters.\n\nChambers was the announcer on the kid's show \"Fun House\" from 1990 to 1991. In contrast to his style of dancing, he would dance while \"rapping\" the opening spiel at the start of the show. He appeared in Sugar Ray's 1997 video of the song \"Fly\" and break danced in the video.\n\nAs of 2014, Chambers was in talks to do a second sequel to the \"Breakin’\" franchise.\n\nBoogaloo Shrimp Chambers is referenced in the 1999 single \"Summer Girls\", by the pop group LFO.\n\n"}

An alternate designation is 'Political parties of minorities', but they should not be mistaken with regionalist or separatist parties, whose purpose is territorial autonomy.\n\n\"Ethnic party is defined here as an organization authorized to compete in local or national elections; the majority of its leadership and membership identify themselves as belonging to a nondominant ethnic group, and its electoral platform includes demands and programs of an ethnic or cultural nature.\"\n\n\"An ethnic party is a party that overtly represents itself as a champion of the cause of one particular ethnic category or set of categories to the exclusion of others, and that makes such a representation central to its strategy of mobilizing voters.\"\n\nThe oldest prototypes of ethnic parties are the Jewish parties of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires, e.g. Bund, Folkspartei, World Agudath Israel, and the Swedish party in Finland, Svenska Folkpartiet (SFP), all of them founded in the end of the 19th century or in the first decade of the 20th.\n\nEthnic parties may take different ideological positions.\n\nFor instance, the parties competing for Jewish votes in interwar Poland and Lithuania had a range of different political views. There were Zionist parties (themselves divided into Revisionist, General, Religious or Labour parties), there was Agudat Israel (an Orthodox religious party), the Bund (Marxist) and the Folkspartei (liberal).\n\nIn some political systems, party politics are mostly based on ethnicity, as in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its federal regions, in Israel, in Suriname, in Sabah, in Sarawak or in Guyana. In Fiji, 46 seats out of 71 are elected from ethnically-closed Communal constituencies, as there was in the pre-Israel Palestine Jewish Assembly, the Asefat ha-Nivharim with separate 'curiae' for Ashkenaz, Sepharad and Oriental, and Yemeni Jews.\n\nAs a consequence, it would be somewhat irrelevant to classify some parties in these systems as 'ideological' (social-democrat, liberal, christian democratic etc.) and some others as 'purely autonomist', 'purely ethnic' or 'purely minority' parties.\n\nThe Swedish People's Party of Finland (SFP) is a full-fledged member of the Liberal International, as well as the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, representing the Turkish minority in Bulgaria, the South Tyrol People's Party (SVP, grouping German- and Ladin-speaking inhabitants of Italy's South Tyrol province) is a member of the Christian Democratic European People's Party, whereas the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), an Irish Catholic party in Northern Ireland is a member of the Socialist International, etc.\n\nIn interwar Poland, Jewish, German and Ukrainian parties never attracted all Polish Jews, Germans and Ukrainians of whom some were members of 'national' ideological Polish parties, mostly the Socialist and Communist parties, who were considered more open-minded than the conservative or nationalist parties.\n\nCommon lists or electoral agreements can be organized either between ethnic parties (Flemish parties 'Kartel's for municipal elections in Brussels or Union des Francophones in Flemish Brabant, the coalition for the 2001 parliamentary elections in Bulgaria between the - mostly Turkish - Movement for Rights and Freedoms and the Roma party Euroroma) or between two parties having common ideological options beyond ethnic differences, as the Bund and the 'Polish' socialist party PPS for the municipal elections in 1939.\n\nSome ethnic parties only take part in substatal electoral competition, thus making them somewhat invisible to outside observers: the South Schleswig Voter Federation in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, the German parties in Denmark (Schleswig Party) and Poland (German Minority in Silesia), the Silesian Autonomy Movement in Poland, the Romani parties in Slovakia (Roma Civic Initiative).\n\nIt can occur that a single 'supra-ideological' party achieves, with varying shades of success, the representation of a whole ethnic group, as for the Swedish People's Party in Finland, the South Schleswig Voter Federation for Danes and Frisians in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, the Unity for Human Rights Party for Greeks in Albania, the Slovene Union for Slovenes in north-eastern Italy, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms for Turks in Bulgaria, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania.\n\nIn most cases, ethnic parties compete inside electoral systems where voters aren't compelled to vote according to ethnic affiliations and may vote too for 'non ethnic', 'transethnic' or 'supraethnic' ideological parties. In most Near Eastern Arab countries, the only such parties were the Communist parties, whose founding fathers and subsequent leaders came mostly from the Jewish, Armenian, Kurdish or Shi'ia minorities. The socialist movement in Thessaloniki (present Northern Greece) during the last decade of the Ottoman Empire was divided across ethnic lines between the Sephardi Jews (who formed the majority of the population), the Bulgarian and Macedonian Slavs and the Greeks, but all groups united when it came to election time.\n\nThere is also a specifically diasporic type of political parties that could be labelled as 'intraethnic parties', i.e. parties that compete only inside the diasporic political sphere.\n\nThe Jewish and Armenian (Dashnak, Ramgavar, or Hentchak) parties belong to this category, as well as the international sections of national parties, such as the (U.S.) Republicans Abroad and Democrats Abroad, the (French) Parti socialiste's Fédération des Français de l'étranger or the American and European branches of the Israeli Likud and of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party of China).\n\nThere can also be specific political groupings representing members of a national community living abroad, such as the Association démocratique des Français de l'étranger - Français du Monde (left-wing) and the Union des Français de l'Etranger (right-wing), both competing for seats in the Assemblée des Français de l'étranger (), or the various political lists competing for the Comitati degli italiani all'estero (COMITES).\n\n"}

It is directed by Phil Roman and written by \"Garfield\" creator Jim Davis, and features the voices of Lorenzo Music, Thom Huge, Gregg Berger and C. Lindsay Workman. It originally aired on CBS on October 30, 1985.\n\nThe special, a ghost story with a pirate theme, originally aired near Halloween and afterwards often played around the time of the holiday. It won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and was also the subject of an illustrated children's book adaptation.\n\nThis was the fourth of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991.\n\nGarfield is awakened early in the morning by the obnoxious \"Binky the Clown Show\" and learns that it is Halloween, becoming excited about trick-or-treating. He tricks Odie into thinking dogs are required to trick-or-treat with cats and give almost all of their candy to them, save one piece of candy for the dog. Odie is tempted by the minimal reward, and the two head for the attic to find costumes in an old trunk. After considering a number of options, Garfield decides he and Odie will be pirates.\n\nJon Arbuckle gives them sacks and tells them to have a good time and not be out too late. They head out trick-or-treating amongst children in the neighborhood. When Odie expresses fear, Garfield assures him the scary characters they see are only children in costumes, only to lift some of the costumes and discover the characters are actually supernatural. At the end of the evening, they arrive on a dock and Garfield decides to cross the river on a row boat to visit more houses. When Garfield tells Odie to put out the oars, Odie misinterprets the command and throws the oars overboard, leaving the boat adrift as the current takes it down the river.\n\nSoon the boat arrives at an abandoned dock near a run-down mansion. They venture inside the home, thinking it is deserted, but are startled to find an old man sitting in an armchair. The man relates a story that exactly 100 years ago, pirates, pursued by government troops, buried their treasure in the floor of the mansion and signed a blood oath to return for the treasure at midnight 100 years later, even if it meant rising from the grave. The old man says he was the ten-year-old cabin boy whom the pirates had long ago. Garfield and Odie start to leave and Garfield asks the man if he wants to come too, but the old man has disappeared. The man steals their boat and leaves the two pets behind.\n\nThe longcase clock chimes midnight and Garfield and Odie watch as a ghostly ship materializes on the river and pirate ghosts emerge from the water. Garfield and Odie hide in an empty cupboard as the ghosts reclaim their buried treasure from the floorboards of the house. As the cat and dog stay where they are, Odie sneezes and alerts the ghosts to their whereabouts. Making a run for it, Garfield and Odie jump into the river to escape, where Odie has to rescue Garfield as he cannot swim. Garfield and Odie wash ashore and find their boat with the candy still inside and untouched. They go home happy and Garfield repays Odie's rescue by reluctantly giving him his rightful share of the candy. Afterwards, Garfield turns on the TV and sees the old man wearing his pirate hat and hosting an all-night pirate movie festival. Rather than watch, Garfield turns off the TV and goes to bed.\n\nPhil Roman, who previously directed \"Garfield\" specials \"Here Comes Garfield\" and \"Garfield on the Town\", founded his own company called Film Roman to continue producing the specials. \"Garfield in Disguise\" was one of the first specials he made under his own company, after \"Garfield in the Rough\". Writer Jim Davis stated he intended the special to begin on a familiar tone, then \"go somewhere that would at least scare 4-year-olds\". For the part of the old man, C. Lindsay Workman was cast as the voice, having previously voiced Garfield's grandfather in \"Garfield on the Town\". Producer Lee Mendelson chose Workman, searching for a deep voice.\n\nThe animation was carried out in Indiana, with Davis saying animators sought to achieve a \"swirly, cross-dissolve\" effect to portray the ghosts. The animators also sought to give the ghosts a glowing affect. Workman's character was designed to emphasize his advanced age, with one staff artist urging the addition of warts and different-looking eyes. For the musical score, Ed Bogas and Desirée Goyette were employed, having previously worked on \"Garfield\" television specials.\n\nAnnounced as \"Garfield's Halloween Adventure\", \"Garfield in Disguise\" was originally aired on October 30, 1985, along with the 1966 \"Peanuts\" special \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\", on CBS. In later years, it was often aired in the Halloween season along with \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\". By 2015, \"Garfield's Halloween Adventure\" was not regularly broadcast.\n\nA 64-page illustrated book adaptation was published in 1985 by Random House Publishing Group, originally under the title \"Garfield in Disguise\" and later retitled \"Garfield's Halloween Adventure\". It includes an alternate ending in which Garfield steals a ring from the pirates' treasure, resulting in the ghosts pursuing the protagonists back to the Arbuckle house, where Garfield surrenders the ring. The special was included on the DVD \"The Garfield Holiday Collection\" on November 4, 2014, sold only by Walmart, and was also made available for digital download on November 11 that year.\n\nIn 1985, Rick Sherwood of the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" called the special \"a charming story\" and Garfield \"the classic kitty\". \"The Bryan Times\" in Ohio praised the special as \"hilarious\". In 1986, \"Garfield's Halloween Adventure\" won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. It was the third \"Garfield\" special to win the Emmy, with the only other nominee being another \"Garfield\" special, \"Garfield in Paradise\". In 1988, Jon Burlingame of Hendersonville's \"The Times-News\" panned \"Garfield’s Halloween Adventure\" as \"more up-to-date but charmless\" in comparison to \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\", and objected that the \"Peanuts\" special was aired less in favour of the \"Garfield\" cartoon.\n\nIn a 2013 roundtable, \"The A.V. Club\" writers analyzed \"Garfield’s Halloween Adventure\", with Erik Adams judging the special to be distinguished in \"Garfield\" TV canon by \"Its abrupt left turn into abject terror,\" and concluded it was nearly as good as \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\". Molly Eichel agreed \"the special takes a left turn into something more sinister\". In 2015, Johnny Brayson of \"Bustle\" wrote \"I may be in the minority, but I consider \"Garfield's Halloween Adventure\" to be on equal footing with \"Charlie Brown\",\" citing its humor and horror.\n\n"}

He is best known for his poems, some of them sonnets, written in the dialect of Rome.\n\nTrilussa grew up very poor, as his father died when he was only three years old. He was a pupil of the Collegio San Giuseppe - Istituto De Merode from 1880 to 1886, first in the original location of Palazzo Poli at fontana di Trevi and then at the current location of piazza di Spagna where the school was relocated in 1885.\n\nTrilussa made a very early poetic debut in 1887 in the \"Rugantino\" magazine edited by Alfredo Zanazzo. Later he also wrote for \"Don Chisciotte\", \"Capitan Fracassa\", \"Il Messaggero\" and \"Il Travaso delle idee\". His first collection, \"Le stelle de Roma\" (\"Rome's Stars\"), was written in 1889.\n\nTrilussa's fame grew in the 1920s and 1930s though he was not a part of any literary circle, preferring instead to hang out in the streets and taverns which were the sources of his inspiration. His poetry features the petit bourgeoisie of Rome: the housewife, the store clerk and the servant but also contain strong satirical denunciations against governments and the vices of rich people. Some of the sonnets are Aesop-like moralistic fables. Trilussa's own sketches and drawings were featured alongside his poetry.\n\nA very popular person in his city and Italy, Trilussa was named Life Senator on December 1, 1950, by the Italian President Luigi Einaudi. He died twenty days later.\n\nIn the work known as \"Illustrissimi\", a collection of letters written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice, Trilussa is one of the recipients of the letters.\n\nSalustri was initiated to the Italian Scottish Rite Freemasonry, influencing the sonnets \"Li framassoni de jeri\" and \"Li frammassoni de oggi\".\n\n\nIn 2013 the Italian programm RAI broadcast a TV miniseries about Trissula's life, \"Trilussa - Storia d'amore e di poesia\", realized by Lodovico Gasparini.\n\n\n\n"}

RADIX-50's 40-character repertoire (050 in octal) can encode six characters plus four additional bits into one 36-bit word (PDP-6, PDP-10/DECsystem-10, DECSYSTEM-20); three characters plus two additional bits into one 18-bit word (PDP-9, PDP-15); or three characters into one 16-bit word (PDP-11, VAX).\n\nThe actual encoding differed between the 36-bit and 16-bit systems.\n\nThe name \"SQUOZE\" was borrowed from the scheme used in the SHARE 709 operating system for representing object code symbols. IBM SQUOZE packed six characters of a 50-character alphabet plus two additional flag bits into one 36-bit word.\n\nRadix-50 in 36-bit systems was commonly used in symbol tables for assemblers or compilers which supported six-character symbol names. This left four bits to encode properties of the symbol.\n\nRadix-50 was not normally used in 36-bit systems for encoding ordinary character strings; file names were normally encoded as six 6-bit characters, and full ASCII strings as five 7-bit characters and one unused bit per 36-bit word.\n\nRadix-50 (called Radix 50 format) was used in Digital's 18-bit PDP-9 and PDP-15 computers to store symbols in symbol tables, leaving two extra bits per word (\"symbol classification bits\").\n\nSome strings in DEC's 16-bit systems were encoded as 8-bit bytes, while others used Radix-50. In Radix-50, strings were encoded in successive words as needed, with the first character within each word located in the most significant position. For example, using the PDP-11 encoding, the string \"ABCDEF\", with character values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, would be encoded as a word containing the value 1×40 + 2×40 + 3×40 = 1,683, followed by a second word containing the value 4×40 + 5×40 + 6×40 = 6,606. Thus, 16-bit words encoded values ranging from 0 (three spaces) to 63,999 (\"999\"). When there were fewer than three characters in a word, the last word for the string was padded with trailing spaces.\n\nThere were several minor variations of the encoding families. For example, the RT-11 operating system considered the character corresponding to value to be undefined, and some utility programs used that value to represent the character instead.\n\nThe use of Rad-50 was the source of the filename size conventions used by Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 operating systems. Using Rad-50 encoding, six characters of a filename could be stored in two 16-bit words, while three more extension (file type) characters could be stored in a third 16-bit word. The period that separated the filename and its extension was implied (i.e., was not stored and always assumed to be present). Rad-50 was also commonly used in the symbol tables of the various PDP-11 programming languages.\n"}

Fitz Roy, however, was only one of a number of peaks the Tehuelche called Chaltén.\n\nArgentina and Chile have agreed that their international border detours eastwards to pass over the main summit, but a large part of the border to the south of the summit, as far as Cerro Murallón, remains undefined. The mountain is the symbol of the Argentine Santa Cruz Province, which includes its representation on its coat of arms.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name comes from the 1889 popular song of the same name, still familiar to many at the time. Although the King Features strip was an obvious knock-off with several similar parallels, the approach was quite different, and \"Little Annie Rooney\" had a successful run from January 10, 1927, to April 16, 1966.\n\nThe strip's creators over the years included Ed Verdier (1927–29), Ben Batsford (1929-30), Sunday strips by Nicholas Afonsky (1934–43), writer Brandon Walsh (1930–54) and Darrell McClure (1930–66). McClure's assistants were Bob Dunn and Fran Matera.\n\nDaily\n\nSunday\n\nThe Sunday page had a topper in the 1930s and early 40s. The first one, \"Fablettes\", began in the early 1930s and ended on March 10, 1935. This was replaced by \"Ming Foo\", which ran from March 17, 1935 to March 28, 1943.\n\nThe name was popularized in a 19th-century song by Michael Nolan. After Nolan sang \"Little Annie Rooney\" in English music halls in 1890, Annie Hart (aka \"The Bowery Girl\") brought it to the United States. When she performed at New York's London Theatre, the song became a hit, but the absence of any international copyright laws kept Nolan from collecting royalties.\n\nA bitter Nolan retired from composing, and his song later became a favorite piano roll and calliope tune, heard at circuses and carousels. The lyrics make it clear that the Annie of the song and the Annie of the strip are two different characters:\n\nThere is also a Scottish saying: \"She is having an Annie Rooney,\" which means that someone is displaying rage and anger. Annie Rooney's pet expression was \"Gloriosky!\" That unique G-rated expletive and \"Little Orphan Annie\"'s \"Leapin' lizards!\" both found their way into the Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim song, \"Gee, Officer Krupke!\", from \"West Side Story\".\n\nHarvey Kurtzman had both Annies in mind when he created his satirical \"Little Annie Fanny\" for \"Playboy\", though the ribald parody owed far more to the original Harold Gray strip.\n\nJames Joyce referred to \"Little Annie Rooney\" early in the first chapter of \"Finnegans Wake\": \"Arrah, sure, we all love little Anny Ruiny, or, we mean to say, lovelittle Anna Rayiny, when unda her brella, mid piddle med puddle, she ninnygoes nannygoes nancing by.\"\n\nPrior to the creation of the identically titled comic strip, Mary Pickford starred as a girl of the slums in William Beaudine's 1925 silent comedy-drama \"Little Annie Rooney\" (United Artists), set in New York's Lower East Side. Audiences found nothing unusual about 32-year-old Mary Pickford portraying a 12-year-old, and this became one of her most successful films. Turner Classic Movies has aired a restored version, produced by the Mary Pickford Foundation. The Fleischer Studios did a \"Little Annie Rooney\" animated \"Screen Song\" in 1931.\n\nFox Film Corporation purchased the rights to the comic strip and planned to turn it into a film starring child actress Jane Withers. This project became the 1935 film \"Ginger\", Withers' first starring role.\n\nShirley Temple did her first teenage role (receiving her second screen kiss) in \"Miss Annie Rooney\" (1942); the George Bruce screenplay is not an adaptation of the comic strip but instead dramatizes the situation of a poor girl with a wealthy boyfriend. In Gavin Lambert's 1963 novel \"Inside Daisy Clover,\" which is set in the 1950s, Daisy becomes a star after appearing in her first movie, a musical remake of Mary Pickford's \"Little Annie Rooney.\"\n\n\"Little Annie Rooney on the Highway to Adventure\" was one of several Big Little Books. After a 1935 book of reprints, \"Little Annie Rooney\" was seen in comic book reprints — David McKay Publications's \"Feature Book\" #11 (1938), \"King Comics\", a 1948 three-issue series published by St. John Publications and the \"Treasury of Comics\" annuals (1948–1950), also from St. John.\n\nStrickler, Dave. \"Syndicated Comic Strips and Artists, 1924-1995: The Complete Index.\" Cambria, California: Comics Access, 1995. \n\n"}

In 2016, it had a population of 496.\n\nLike many of the older villages in the region, it was built on a hilltop for defensive purposes and to provide more farmland on the plains below. It is a small town, with only one paved road running through the middle. It contains little more than a café, a bakery, a hotel, a restaurant, a church, as well as a school.\n\nCrillon-le-Brave is situated from Carpentras, from Avignon and about from Bédoin. It lies close to the Mont Ventoux, at the south foot.\n\nExcavations have shown that the village was occupied since the Neolithic period. Researchers collected scrapers and piercers in the Espelettes district, and lithic tools at the Camas and Sous-les-Roques sites. Vestiges also attest that the place was inhabited in Roman times. Amphoras, potteries and dolia were exhumed from quarries as well as an altar to Jupiter and a Cippus. On the site of Auberte, potter's oven were discovered dated to the third century.\n\nIn Roman times, the town went by the name \"Crillonium\", and later \"Crillon\", but one could say that its modern history begins in the 14th century when a leading Avignon family acquired the feudal rights to the village. A long line of dukes ruled Crillon throughout the period leading up to the French Revolution.\n\nThe village takes its full name of \"Crillon-le-Brave\" from the most legendary of its dukes: Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon or \"Le Brave Crillon\" (1541–1615) was one of Henri IV's fiercest and most valiant generals during the French Wars of Religion in the late 16th century. The same Crillon family also gave its name to the famous Hôtel de Crillon in Paris.\n\nLike most of the buildings surrounding the church at the top of the village, the houses that form the core of the Hostellerie have their origins in the 16th and 17th centuries and played an important part in village life. The Maison Roche was originally the presbytère - the priest's home, and at the same time the village school.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century Crillon-le-Brave was a prosperous village of 800 inhabitants served by several cafés, bars and stores. There was even a local philharmonic society. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, the village began a long slow decline. Two wars and a failing water supply left the village almost abandoned and many of its houses fell into ruins. But since the early 1970s new inhabitants have brought new life to the old stones, so that today Crillon-le-Brave has once again become a lively village.\n\n"}

The youngest of them, Loredana Bertè, was born on the same day and month as Martini, and also became famous as a singer. Her father, Giuseppe Radames Bertè (died 2017), was a teacher of Latin and Greek, while her mother, Maria Salvina Dato (died 2003), was an elementary school teacher. \"Mimì\", as Domenica was known, spent her childhood in Porto Recanati (Macerata). In 1962, she convinced her mother to take her to Milan for an audition.\n\nShe recorded her first records as Mimì Bertè, but soon decided to change her name to Mia Martini. She represented Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest twice: in 1977 with \"Libera\" (13th out of 18), and in 1992 with \"Rapsodia\" (4th out of 23). That same year she recorded \"Per amarti\", written by Bruno Lauzi and Maurizio Fabrizio. She won the World Popular Song Festival Yamaha in Tokyo with \"Ritratto di donna\" who comes to the first positions in the Japanese charts. In 1982 she participated at the Sanremo Festival. In late 1983, she decided to retire.\n\nIn 1989 she returned to the Sanremo Festival with \"Almeno tu nell'universo\", which won her the Critics Award and new success, the song remains an italian classic (with many cover versions).\n\nIn 1992, she was back in the race at the Sanremo Festival with \"Gli uomini non cambiano\", by Giancarlo Bigazzi and Beppe Dati. She won second place, allowing her to represent Italy at Eurovision again, which that year was held in Sweden, where she closed with in fourth place with \"Rapsodia\".\n\nShe suffered from painful fibroids, for which she took prescription medication. On 14 May 1995, her body was found in the apartment in Via Liguria 38 in Cardano al Campo. According to the coroner's report, her death was by cardiac arrest (in her body traces of cocaine were found). Her body was cremated.\n\nIn 2019, is released the biographical film Io sono Mia, directed by Riccardo Donna (the title is, in Italian, a double entendre: I am Mia, but also I am mine).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2183606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183606", "title": "Sleep mode", "text": "Sleep mode\n\nSleep mode (or suspend to RAM) is a low power mode for electronic devices such as computers, televisions, and remote controlled devices. These modes save significantly on electrical consumption compared to leaving a device fully on and, upon resume, allow the user to avoid having to reissue instructions or to wait for a machine to reboot. Many devices signify this power mode with a pulsed or red colored LED power light.\n\nIn computers, entering a sleep state is roughly equivalent to \"pausing\" the state of the machine. When restored, the operation continues from the same point, having the same applications and files open.\n\nSleep mode has gone by various names, including \"Stand By\", \"Suspend\" and \"Suspend to RAM\" . Machine state is held in RAM and, when placed in sleep mode, the computer cuts power to unneeded subsystems and places the RAM into a minimum power state, just sufficient to retain its data. Because of the large power saving, most laptops automatically enter this mode when the computer is running on batteries and the lid is closed. If undesired, the behavior can be altered in the operating system settings.\n\nA computer must consume some energy while sleeping in order to power the RAM and to be able to respond to a wake-up event. A sleeping PC is a case of a machine on standby power, and this is covered by regulations in many countries, for example in the United States limiting such power under the One Watt Initiative, from 2010. In addition to a wake-up press of the power button, PCs can also respond to other wake cues, such as from keyboard, mouse, incoming telephone call on a modem, or local area network signal.\n\nHibernation, also called Suspend to Disk on Linux, saves all computer operational data on the fixed disk before turning the computer off completely. On switching the computer back on, the computer is restored to its state prior to hibernation, with all programs and files open, and unsaved data intact. In contrast with standby mode, hibernation mode saves the computer's state on the hard disk, which requires no power to maintain, whereas standby mode saves the computer's state in RAM, which requires a small amount of power to maintain.\n\nSleep mode and hibernation can be combined: the contents of RAM are first copied to non-volatile storage like for regular hibernation, but then, instead of powering down, the computer enters sleep mode. This approach combines the benefits of sleep mode and hibernation: The machine can resume instantaneously, but it can also be powered down completely (e.g. due to loss of power) without loss of data, because it is already effectively in a state of hibernation. This mode is called \"hybrid sleep\" in Microsoft Windows other than Windows XP.\n\nA hybrid mode is supported by some portable Apple Macintosh computers, compatible hardware running Microsoft Windows Vista or newer, as well as Linux distributions running kernel 3.6 or newer.\n\nACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is the current standard for power management, superseding APM (Advanced Power Management) and providing the backbone for sleep and hibernation on modern computers. Sleep mode corresponds to ACPI mode S3. When a non-ACPI device is plugged in, Windows will sometimes disable stand-by functionality for the whole operating system. Without ACPI functionality, as seen on older hardware, sleep mode is usually restricted to turning off the monitor and spinning down the hard drive.\n\nWhen sleep mode was first introduced, not all PC hardware supported it correctly, which could cause problems with peripherals that did not detect the transition. This is rarely a problem with newer hardware and operating systems.\n\nMicrosoft Windows 2000 and later support sleep at the operating system level (OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state) without special drivers from the hardware manufacturer. Windows Vista's Fast Sleep and Resume feature saves the contents of volatile memory to hard disk before entering sleep mode (aka Hybrid sleep). If power to memory is lost, it will use the hard disk to wake up. The user has the option of hibernating directly if they wish.\n\nIn older versions prior to Windows Vista, sleep mode was under-used in business environments as it was difficult to enable organization-wide without resorting to third-party PC power management software. As a result, these earlier versions of Windows were criticized for wasting energy.\n\nThere remains a market in third-party PC power management software for newer versions of Windows, offering features beyond those built into the operating system. Most products offer Active Directory integration and per-user/per-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans, scheduled power plans, anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting. Vendors include 1E NightWatchman, Data Synergy PowerMAN (Software) and Verdiem SURVEYOR.\n\nSleep on Macs running macOS consist of the traditional sleep, Safe Sleep, and Power Nap. In System Preferences, Safe Sleep is referred to as sleep. Since Safe Sleep also allowed state to be restored in an event of a power outage, unlike other operating systems, hibernate was never offered as an option.\n\nIn 2005, some Macs running Mac OS X v10.4 began to support Safe Sleep. The feature saves the contents of volatile memory to the system hard disk each time the Mac enters Sleep mode. The Mac can instantaneously wake from sleep mode if power to the RAM has not been lost. However, if the power supply was interrupted, such as when removing batteries without an AC power connection, the Mac would wake from Safe Sleep instead, restoring memory contents from the hard drive.\n\nSafe Sleep capability is found in Mac models starting with the October 2005 revision of the PowerBook G4 (Double-Layer SD). Mac OS X v10.4 or higher is also required. A hack enabled the feature as well on older Macs running Mac OS X v10.4.\n\nIn 2012, Apple introduced Power Nap with OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and select Mac models. Power Nap allows the Mac to perform tasks silently, such as iCloud syncing and Spotlight indexing. Only low energy tasks are performed when on battery power, while higher energy tasks are performed with AC power.\n\nBecause of widespread use of this symbol, a campaign was launched to add a set of power characters to Unicode. In February 2015, the proposal was accepted by Unicode and the characters were included in Unicode 9.0. The characters are in the \"Miscellaneous Technical\" block, with code points 23FB-FE.\n\nThe symbol is ⏾ (&#x23FE;) - defined as \"Power Sleep Symbol\"\n\n"}

He was also the paternal first cousin of Safwan ibn Umayya.\n\nSince he had persecuted Muslims earlier, he feared the well-being of his son, especially since he remembered the many Meccans killed in Badr. He then conspired with Safwan ibn Umayyah to kill Muhammad. Safwan agreed to take all of Umayr's debts in order for Umayr to go to the Muslims and kill Muhammad.\n\nWhen he got there, he was recognized by Umar ibn al-Khattab, who said:\n\nThis is the dog, the enemy of God, Umayr ibn Wahb.

It was published to document the veracity of the depiction of slavery in Stowe's anti-slavery novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1852). First published in 1853 by Jewett, Proctor & Worthington, the book also provides insights into Stowe's own views on slavery.\n\nAfter the publication of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", Southerners accused Stowe of misrepresenting slavery. In order to show that she had neither lied about slavery nor exaggerated the plight of enslaved people, she compiled \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\". The book was subtitled \"Presenting the Original Facts and Documents upon Which the Story Is Founded, Together with Corroborative Statements Verifying the Truth of the Work\".\n\nThe reaction of Stowe's contemporaries to \"A Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin\" was very similar to the reaction to \"Uncle Tom’s Cabin\", with both very positive and very negative reviews. The responses of abolitionists and Northerners in general were among the positive, lauding the documentation of the evils of slavery and the confirmation of the truth of \"Uncle Tom’s Cabin.\"\n\nThe great interest in \"Uncle Tom’s Cabin\" in England also transferred to the \"Key\". One English review of the 1853 publication called it a \"marvelous book, more so if possible than \"Uncle Tom’s Cabin\" itself\". This same review also commends Stowe's self-control and character. This impression of Stowe and the reception of the book is much different than the reaction to the \"Key\" in the South.\n\nThe pro-slavery response to the \"Key\" paralleled the response to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". Despite Stowe's use of documented examples, most Southern reviews still claimed that Stowe was misrepresenting slavery and exaggerating the cruelty of the institution. A review in the \"Southern Literary Messenger\" called the \"Key\" a \"distortion of the facts and mutilation of the records, for the sake of giving substance to the scandalous fancy, and reduplicating the falsehood of the representation\".\nAlthough these reviews claimed that Stowe was misrepresenting slavery, they did not accuse Stowe of using false documentation. Rather they claimed that the examples that Stowe provided are the most extreme instances, which she gathered to give the worst possible impression of the institution of slavery, and of the South. One critic, William Simms, accused her of using faulty argumentation by gathering facts to prove her assumption, instead of forming assumptions based on facts.\n\nAnother pro-slavery response to both \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was attacks on Stowe's character. Many reviews made insinuations about what sort of woman Stowe must be to write about such events as were found in the \"Key\". A review by George Holmes questioned whether \"scenes of license and impurity, and ideas of loathsome depravity and habitual prostitution [are] to be made the cherished topics of the female pen\"; he appealed to women, especially Southern women, not to read Stowe's works.\n\nIn spite of the varied reviews of \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\", it sold well: 90,000 copies in the first month, a clear best-seller.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2183637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183637", "title": "Watchtower", "text": "Watchtower\n\nA watchtower is a type of fortification used in many parts of the world. It differs from a regular tower in that its primary use is military and from a turret in that it is usually a freestanding structure. Its main purpose is to provide a high, safe place from which a sentinel or guard may observe the surrounding area. In some cases, non-military towers, such as religious towers, may also be used as watchtowers.\n\nThe Romans built numerous towers as part of a system of communications, one example being the towers along Hadrian's Wall in Britain. Romans built many lighthouses, such as the Tower of Hercules in northern Spain, which survives to this day as a working building, and the equally famous lighthouse at Dover Castle, which survives to about half its original height as a ruin.\n\nIn medieval Europe, many castles and manor houses, or similar fortified buildings, were equipped with watchtowers. In some of the manor houses of western France, the watchtower equipped with arrow or gun loopholes was one of the principal means of defense. A feudal lord could keep watch over his domain from the top of his tower.\n\nIn southern Saudi Arabia and Yemen, small stone and mud towers called \"qasaba\" were constructed as either watchtowers or keeps in the Asir mountains. Furthermore, in Najd, a watchtower, called \"Margab\", was used to watch for approaching enemies far in distance and shout calling warnings from atop.\n\nScotland saw the construction of Peel towers that combined the function of watchtower with that of a keep or tower house that served as the residence for a local notable family.\n\nMediterranean countries, and Italy in particular, saw the construction of numerous coastal watchtowers since the early Middle Ages, connected to the menace of Saracen attacks from the various Muslim states existing at the time (such as the Balearic Islands, Ifriqiya or Sicily). \nLater (starting from the 16th century) many were restored or built against the Barbary pirates.\n\nSome notable examples of military Mediterranean watchtowers include the towers that the Knights of Malta had constructed on the coasts of Malta. These towers ranged in size from small watchtowers to large structures armed with numerous cannons. They include the Wignacourt, de Redin, and Lascaris towers, named for the Grand Master, such as Martin de Redin, that commissioned each series.\n\nIn the Channel Islands, the Jersey Round Towers and the Guernsey loophole towers date from the late 18th Century. They were erected to give warning of attacks by the French. \nThe Martello towers that the British built in the UK and elsewhere in the British Empire were defensive fortifications that were armed with cannon and that were often within line of sight of each other. One of the last Martello towers to be built was Fort Denison in Sydney harbour. The most recent descendants of the Martello Towers are the flak towers that the various combatants erected in World War II as mounts for anti-aircraft artillery.\n\nIn modern warfare the relevance of watchtowers has decreased due to the availability of alternative forms of military intelligence, such as reconnaissance by spy satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. However watch towers have been used in counter-insurgency wars to maintain a military presence in conflict areas in case such as by the French Army in French Indochina, by the British Army and the RUC in Northern Ireland and the IDF in Gaza and West Bank.\n\nAn example of the nonmilitary watchtower in history is one of Jerusalem. Though the Hebrews used it to keep a watch for approaching armies, the religious authorities forbade the taking of weapons up into the tower as this would require bringing weapons through the temple. Rebuilt by King Herod, that Watchtower was renamed after Mark Antony, his friend who battled against Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (later Augustus) and lost.\n\n"}

Though the son of a nobleman, as a young man he withdrew to a rock cave in order to meditate. After the death of his parents, he gave away all of his possessions and established himself in the Val di Non () in Trentino.\n\nRomedius is often depicted alongside or astride a bear. According to his hagiography he wanted to visit the friend of his youth, St. Vigilius, Bishop of Trento (who died in 405), but his horse was torn to pieces by a wild bear. Romedius, however, had the bear bridled by his disciple David (Davide). The bear became docile and carried Romedius on its back to Trento. The tamed bear is a motif also of Saint Corbinian, bishop of Freising.\n\nUpon Romedius' death, his body was laid to rest in a small tomb above his cave in the mountains, a site that was soon visited by pilgrims. The Sanctuary of San Romedio grew from the little church that was built to venerate him to the popular pilgrimage shrine, the \"Santuario di San Romedio\" is across the lake from Cles at the head of the Val di Non, above the village of Sanzeno. The sanctuary where Romedio lived with his bear companion is a complex of several churches, from the Romanesque period to the 20th century beyond a gateway in the forested slopes. Votive offerings of crutches line the walls of the narrow stone stairwell up to the highest chapel, said to mark the site of the saint's retreat. \n\nHis local cult, which consolidated itself in the course of the 11th century, was officially recognized in the twelfth by the Bishop of Trento. In 1795, permission was given to read masses in his name in the diocese of Brixen, which at that time included the Northern Tyrol. His cult remains popular in Trentino, Bavaria, and the Tyrol.\n\nIn remembrance of this legend, in 1958 Italian Senator G. G. Gallarati Scotti, honorary member of the committee for the foundation of the World Wildlife Fund in Italy, purchased Charlie, a bear intended to be killed, and donated it to the Sanctuary of San Romedio, in the Valle di Non.\n\nToday, the Province of Trentino protects the last brown bears of the Alps in the Adamello-Brenta National Park, and, near the Sanctuary, takes care of young bears born in captivity in Trentino . \n\nIn the work known as \"Illustrissimi\", a collection of letters written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice, Romedius' bear is one of the \"recipients\" of the letters.\n\n\n"}

He retired due to a misdiagnosed heart condition while playing for Brazilian club América-SP in 2007.\n\nDoriva played for the Brazil national football team between 1995 and 1998, making a brief substitute appearance in the 1998 FIFA World Cup in which Brazil finished as runners-up.\n\nDoriva began his career at the youth of São Paulo, and after spending 1992 at Goiás teams Anapolina and Goiânia, was promoted to the main team under coach Telê Santana in 1993. That same year he won both the Libertadores da América and the Intercontinental Cup. In 1995, he was transferred to XV de Piracicaba after having his rights purchased by then-owner Rolim Amaro, founder of TAM Airlines.\n\nDoriva came to Atlético Mineiro in 1995, as the team had just gotten a sponsorship deal with TAM. There Doriva had what he considered crucial years in his formation as a player, leading to a $4 million sale to FC Porto.\n\nDoriva's career in Porto had three Primeira Liga titles before he opted to transfer to Italy's U.C. Sampdoria, in an $8 million four-year contract. In 2000, he went to Spain, playing for Celta Vigo.\n\nDoriva was signed by Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren in January 2003, on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut on 5 April 2003 in a 3–0 home win over West Bromwich Albion.\n\nAfter five appearances for the club, Doriva was given a one-year contract with Middlesbrough on 21 July 2003. In his first full season at the club, Doriva was first choice in midfield alongside George Boateng. He found his chances limited after this, however, due to the emergence of Stewart Downing and the conversion of Boudewijn Zenden to central midfield. On 11 February 2004, in a 3–2 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, Doriva was pushed by Paul Scholes, who in April was given a three-match ban for the incident. On 29 February he started as Middlesbrough won their first major trophy, the 2004 Football League Cup Final, with a 2–1 win over Bolton Wanderers in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. His only goal for Middlesbrough came in a 2–1 victory at Notts County in the third round of the FA Cup on 8 January 2005.\n\nIn 2005, he earned a one-year contract extension, which Middlesbrough allowed to expire in July 2006.\n\nFollowing his release from Middlesbrough, he then signed for América-SP in Brazil, where he had a heart problem detected. Doriva's father and grandfather both died from heart conditions, and therefore he decided to retire from playing. Subsequent tests showed that the diagnosis was inaccurate and he could have continued playing, although he remained retired.\n\nAfter retiring in 2009, Doriva was hired by Ituano's president and former teammate Juninho Paulista; initially a manager of the youth categories, he subsequently became an assistant manager and, in 2014, was appointed as coach. He led Ituano to a Cinderella run on the Campeonato Paulista, winning the title on penalty kicks over Santos.\n\nDoriva was appointed Atlético Paranaense manager on 16 June 2014, but failed to impress, being sacked only two months later.\n\nOn 14 December 2014, Doriva was appointed as manager of Vasco. The following 4 August, after another state league title, he was named at the helm of Ponte Preta; on 7 August, however, he rescinded with the latter and moved to São Paulo.\n\nIn June 2018, Doriva was appointed coach of CRB. He left the club in September, to be replaced by Roberto Fernandes.\n\nDoriva's first cap for the Brazil national football team was in 1995. He was part of the Brazil squad which reached the final of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He wore the number 17 shirt and made one appearance, in the second match of the group. He came on against Morocco in Nantes as a 68th-minute substitute for César Sampaio. He played a total of 12 games for the Brazilian squad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is a documentary filmmaker and author of several books about atrocities committed by the totalitarian states of the Second World War. He is the former Creative Director of History Programmes for the BBC. His documentaries and books are used as teaching aids in British schools.\n\nLaurence Rees was educated at Solihull School and Oxford University. He joined BBC TV in 1978 as a research trainee and subsequently worked as a researcher and assistant producer in factual television between 1978 and 1983. He always wanted to make history documentaries and made his first film as a director and producer at the age of 25 in 1983 – a film portrait of Noël Coward for BBC1.\n\nHe started specializing in history films that related to the Nazis and the Second World War with his controversial programme \"A British Betrayal\" in 1991, followed by \"Goebbels - Master of Propaganda\" in 1992. \n\nRees was appointed editor of \"Timewatch\", the BBC's historical documentary series, in 1992 and over the next 10 years commissioned and editorially oversaw more than a hundred different history films. In 1994 he was also the founder editor of the BBC's biographical TV strand, \"Reputations\". He was subsequently appointed Head of BBC History and Creative Director, BBC History.\n\nUnusually for a senior executive at BBC Television, Rees carried on writing and producing his own programmes alongside his executive producer responsibilities. The series he himself wrote and produced (and also directed the great majority of the films) during this time include the BBC television series \"Nazis: a Warning from History\" (1997), \"War of the Century\" (1999), \"Horror in the East\" (2001), \"Auschwitz, the Nazis and the 'Final Solution\"' (2005) and \"World War Two: Behind Closed Doors\" (2008). He also writes history books and wrote books to accompany each of these series. His book on Auschwitz is the world's best-selling history of the camp.\n\nRees left the BBC in 2008 and created the multimedia educational Website WW2History.com in 2009. The website subsequently won \"Best in Class\"' awards in both the education and reference categories at the Interactive Media Awards.\n\nThrough his own independent production company, LR History, Rees has also written, produced and directed the 2012 BBC television series \"The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler\" (and wrote the accompanying book) and the 90 minute feature-length documentary \"Touched by Auschwitz\" (BBC2 2015).\n\nHe has won many awards for his work. In 2006 he won the British Book Award for history book of the year for \"Auschwitz: the Nazis and the Final Solution\". His television awards include a BAFTA, a Grierson Award, a Broadcasting Press Guild Award, a BANFF festival award, a Broadcast Award, a George Foster Peabody Award, two International Documentary Awards and two Emmys. In New York City in 2009 he received the 'Lifetime Achievement Award' from 'History Makers', the worldwide congress of Historical and Current Affairs programme makers.\n\nIn 2009 he was appointed a Senior Visiting Fellow in the International History Department at the London School of Economics and Political Science, London University. He was awarded an honorary doctorate for services to history by the University of Sheffield in 2005, and an honorary doctorate from the Open University for services to Arts and Sciences in 2011.\n\nClive James, in \"Revolt of the Pendulum\", said that Rees was \"currently producing the best documentaries ever made about the Nazi era\". Antony Beevor, in a book review in the \"Daily Telegraph\", wrote that \"Laurence Rees has done more for good history on television in this country than anyone else.\"\n\nDaniel Snowman, in his profile of Rees in \"Historians\", wrote that \"Rees has created a body of work that is carefully structured and impeccably researched, incorporating vivid archive material from a wide array of sources. Most remarkable, perhaps, are the interviews he has filmed. Rees is one of the few people – perhaps the only one - who has met and interviewed at length not only hundreds of people who suffered from the barbarities of World War II right across the globe but also, crucially, many of the perpetrators. All this has given Rees a comparative, cross-cultural perspective on the horrors of the war that no academic could match.\"\n\nRees's history of the Holocaust, \"The Holocaust: A New History\", was published by PublicAffairs in January 2017.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Like many of Forward's books, the novel is a speculation of the nature of intelligent life in a non-Terran ecosystem, in this case the atmosphere of a gas giant planet.\n\nIn an unspecified time in the future, a multi-national consortium sends a team of six astronauts (each with the chance of earning a billion dollars if they complete their mission properly) to Saturn to establish a factory that mines helium for the production of precious \"meta\" (stabilized metastable helium), a powerful rocket fuel, in the planet's upper atmosphere. With only enough \"meta\" fuel to get them to Saturn, failure will cost them their lives. And all too soon the crew of astronauts crash-lands on a surface, which is actually the back of an enormous alien life-form they dub the Rukh, a 4-kilometer-long, bizarre sting-ray-shaped creature that \"swims\" through Saturn's gaseous upper atmosphere and has two brains, both male and female. When part of their apparatus is swallowed by one of these giant birdlike beings, the crew needs to find a way to communicate and to be able to cooperate with the Rukhs so that they may survive.\n\n\n"}

Punch, and David L. Pulver. The first edition \"GURPS Basic Set\" was published in 1986.\n\n\"GURPS\" stands for Generic Universal Role-Playing System – that is essentially a very flexible descendant of \"The Fantasy Trip\". Basic combat is simple, but advance combat is very position-oriented, almost a complicated boardgame. The level of complexity used is completely up to the players. The character improvement system is skill-based. The many additional supplements to the \"Basic Set\" enable \"GURPS\" characters to move easily from one gaming genre to another.\n\nThe \"Basic Set\" includes a \"Characters\" book (72 pages, covers character creation and development, skills, and basic equipment), \"Adventuring\" (80 pages, covers success rolls, combat, damage, running the game, game and campaign backgrounds, and animals), a 24-page book of charts and tables, and a 32-page book of two introductory scenarios, one a solo.\n\nThe original \"GURPS Basic Set\" included the combat rules from the previously published \"Man to Man\". Magic rules were omitted, but were released in \"GURPS Fantasy\" (1986).\nThe third edition \"GURPS Basic Set\" combines all the books from the previous sets into one volume.\n\nThe third edition revised \"GURPS Basic Set\" replaced the adventure with an appendix covering new generic rules that should have been in the core book was printed in 1994. It was stated that \"If you have an old Third Edition, and the new Compendium, you’ll have it all.\" Reviewers of the time called it \"GURPS 3.5 edition\" while Stave Jackson Game calls all their own non 4th edition GURPS material still in print \"GURPS Classic\".\n\nThe \"GURPS Basic Set\" for the fourth edition of \"GURPS\" was published in 2004 by Steve Jackson Games and contains the core rules for the fourth edition of \"GURPS\". The first volume, \"Characters\" (), addresses what players need to know to create a \"GURPS\" character and play the game. Eight sample characters are included. The second volume is titled \"Campaigns\" () and addresses the information a GM needs to build a world. All the basic information needed to run a \"GURPS\" campaign is here with genre or world-specific information in other books.\n\nThe previous edition of the \"GURPS\" rules consisted of a Basic Set as the core rule book, with \"GURPS Compendium I\" and \"GURPS Compendium II\" released later to collate alternative and advanced rules in a logical place. Many source books published after the release of the compendiums required them for play. The fourth edition basic set shifts the majority of that material into the core rule books.\n\nIn a move from previous editions, the books are hardbound and in color, a trend which has been followed in successive GURPS 4e books, with mixed reactions from players.\n\nTo facilitate the transition from third edition to fourth, a free PDF update was released. It includes a quick but comprehensive guide to change characters or source book information to the new rules.\n\nThe first edition \"GURPS Basic Set\" was written by Steve Jackson with Creede Lambard and Sharleen Lambard, with a cover by Denis Loubet, and was published by Steve Jackson Games in 1986 as a boxed set containing four books (80, 72, 32, and 24 pages), sample character record sheets, and cardstock miniatures. The boxed \"GURPS Basic Set\" appeared at Origins in 1986. Steve Jackson Games began regularly supporting the game with supplements following the publication of the first \"GURPS Basic Set\".\n\nThe second edition revised \"GURPS Basic Set\" was published in 1987. The third edition \"GURPS Basic Set\" featured a cover by Michael Presley, and was published in 1988 as a 256-page book with a 16-page adventure (Caravan from Ein Arris). In 1994 the Basic Set third edition Revised was printed with an appendix replacing the adventure with various new rules.\n\nThe first edition of the \"GURPS Basic Set\" was reviewed by Marcus L. Rowland in issue 83 of \"White Dwarf\" magazine (November 1986). Rowland comments: \"While I can applaud the idea behind the system, I can't really recommend \"GURPS\" at its present stage of development. In the long run, \"GURPS\" and all its supplements may cover more ground than other systems, possibly at less expense, but in the short term there isn't enough support material to run a fully rounded game of any type, apart from gladitorial combat and medieval adventures.\"\n\nMichael DeWolfe reviewed \"GURPS Basic Set\" in \"Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer\" No. 79. DeWolfe commented that \"\"GURPS\" is a good roleplaying system. It combines old ideas with new and surpasses its contemporaries. Playability is paramount, though reality is sacrificed. Its ambitious goal of covering all game worlds looks to be accomblishable.\"\n\n\"Different Worlds\" #47\n\n\"Aventurer\" #6\n\nSecond edition Basic Set reviewed in \"White Wolf\" #13\n\nMichael DeWolfe reviewed the third edition of the \"GURPS Basic Set\" in \"Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer\" #85. DeWolfe comments in his summary: \"This game has looked at its peers and built on all of them; avoiding their mistakes and following their successes. If you're looking for a good point generation system, get \"GURPS\". If you're looking for a truly generic system, get \"GURPS\". If you're looking for a painstakingly coherent system, get \"GURPS\". If you want a fine RPG, get this game. It is worth it.\"\n\nJim Bambra reviewed the third edition of the \"GURPS Basic Set\" for \"Dragon\" magazine #149 (September 1989). Bambra comments: \"Now in its third incarnation, the \"GURPS Basic Set\" is better than ever.

It was released as the second single from the album and was accompanied, like its predecessor \"Ashes to Ashes\", by a highly regarded music video.\n\nIt was ranked as the 8th best single of 1980 by the \"NME\" magazine.\n\nAccording to co-producer Tony Visconti, \"Fashion\" was the last song completed in the \"Scary Monsters\" sessions, its bassline and some of the melody taking inspiration from Bowie's 1975 hit \"Golden Years\". Guest guitarist Robert Fripp contributed a series of harsh, mechanical riffs to complement the band's funk/reggae arrangement.\n\nThe track was noted for its emotionally vacant choir effect, and the recurring onomatopoeia \"beep beep\" that Bowie had first used in an unreleased 1970 song called \"Rupert the Riley\". Another phrase in the lyrics that Bowie borrowed from his past was \"People from Bad Homes\", the title track of a 1973 album he recorded with his protégés The Astronettes, which went unreleased until 1995.\n\nReferences to a \"goon squad\" coming to town provoked theories that the song actually concerns fascism (\"the National Front invade the discos\", inferred \"NME\" critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray). However Bowie played down this interpretation in an interview shortly before the release of \"Scary Monsters\", saying that what he was trying to do was \"move on a little from that Ray Davies concept of fashion, to suggest more of a gritted teeth determination and an unsuredness about why one's doing it\". Biographer David Buckley believed the song \"poked fun at the banality of the dance-floor and the style fascists\" of the New Romantic movement.\n\nDavid Mallet shot a music video for the single \"Fashion\" in a famous nightclub owned by his friend Robert Boykin called Hurrah. The opening shot of the clip features David Bowie on the Hurrah stage which was draped in khaki canvas for this shoot. The faceted mirror walls surrounding the dance floor can be seen in the background of various shots, and all the band scenes are shot in this club setting. Other locations around Manhattan are intercut throughout the clip. Amid a series of facial contortions and other gestures, Bowie made use of a move he had employed in the \"Ashes to Ashes\" video: slowly crouching and bringing his arm down to the ground in a slow vertical arc. \"Record Mirror\" readers voted \"Fashion\" and \"Ashes to Ashes\" the best music videos of 1980.\n\nThe video features Carlos Alomar, G.E. Smith (Hall & Oates), Khandi Alexander, Obba Babatundé, the guitarist Steve Love who plays drums in the video, John Kay, May Pang (later married to the song's producer Tony Visconti) and Alan Hunter, who became one of the first MTV VJs and also the first VJ to appear in a music video.\n\n\"Fashion\" was the second single from \"Scary Monsters\" and the first issued after the album's September 1980 release. The edited 7\" cut reached No. 5 in the UK, and by hitting No. 70 in America gave Bowie his first chart single there in almost four years. The UK sleeve design was adapted for the cover art on the 1980 compilation \"Best of Bowie\". It was featured in the movie \"Clueless\". During the \"Closing Ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics\", \"Fashion\" was used during a tribute to the British fashion industry in a parade that featured a number of top models from the UK.\n\nBowie performed the song on most of his tours after 1980, including the Serious Moonlight Tour (1983), Glass Spider Tour (1987), Sound+Vision Tour (1990), Earthling Tour (1997), Heathen Tour (2002), and A Reality Tour (2003-2004). The song appears on two of his live concert videos: \"Serious Moonlight\" (1983) and \"Glass Spider\" (1988).\n\nThe song was ranked among the top ten \"Tracks of the Year\" for 1980 by \"NME\".\n\nAll tracks written by David Bowie.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2183756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183756", "title": "Houma people", "text": "Houma people\n\nThe Houma () are a historic Native American people of Louisiana on the east side of the Red River of the South. Their descendants, the Houma people or organization \"The United Houma Nation\", have been recognized by the state as a tribe since 1972 and not yet by the federal government.\n\nAccording to the tribe, they have about 17,000 enrolled tribal citizens residing within a six-parish area that encompasses 4,750 square miles. The six parishes are the following: St. Mary, Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard parishes.\n\nThe city of Houma (meaning \"red\"), and the Red River were both named after this people. Oklahoma shares a similar etymology, as the root \"humma\" means \"red\" in Choctaw and related Western Muskogean languages, including Houma.\n\nThe Indigenous Houma language is thought to have fallen out of use by the late 19th century due to European-American encroachment. As a result of a language shift which began during the French colonial period and trading in Louisiana, a majority of Houma people today speak Louisiana French. American English is also widely spoken by the community. Additionally, in light of their distinct society and isolated geography, as many as 3,000 mostly elderly people living on Houma tribal lands in the Lafourche Basin are believed to be monolingual speakers of French.\n\nIn 1907, Swanton interviewed an elderly Houma woman to collect vocabulary from her Houma language. More recently, efforts have been made to collect vocabulary and grammar from elders in order to revitalize the language. As Houma has been identified as being very similar to standard Choctaw, some linguists have concluded that the Houma spoke a Western Muskogean language (akin to Choctaw or Chickasaw). Other scholars have suggested that the data in Swanton's vocabulary is Mobilian Jargon. Some unidentified words may be from other languages spoken on the Mississippi. The Tunica referred to the Mobilian Jargon as \"húma ʼúlu\" (meaning \"Houma's language\").\n\nToday, efforts continue to bring the Houma language back to its people through a group of dedicated Houma persons and linguists, the Houma Language Project.\n\nThe Houma people take a decoction of dried Gamochaeta purpurea for colds and influenza. They make an infusion of the leaves and root of Cirsium horridulum in whiskey, and use it as an astringent, as well as drink it to clear phlegm from lungs and throat. They also eat the tender, white hearts of the plant raw.\n\nThe Houma tribe, thought to be Muskogean-speaking like other Choctaw tribes, was recorded by the French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, in 1682 as living along the Red River on the east side of Mississippi River. Because their war emblem is the \"saktce-ho'ma\", or Red Crawfish, the anthropologist John R. Swanton speculated that the Houma are an offshoot of the Yazoo River region's Chakchiuma tribe, whose name derives from \"saktce-ho'ma\".\n\nIndividuals in the tribe maintained contact with other Choctaw communities after settling in present-day lower Lafourche and Terrebonne parishes. They used the waterways to harvest fish and crawfish, as well as to supply their water needs and for traveling. It is not certain how the Houma came to settle near the mouth of the Red River (formerly called the River of the Houma). By the time of French exploration, the Houma were settled at the site of present-day Angola, Louisiana.\n\nIn 1682 the French explorer Brinson noted in his journal that he had passed near the village of the \"Oumas.\" This brief mention marks the entry of the Houma into written recorded history. Later explorers, such as Henri de Tonti and Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, give a fuller description of the early Houma. Iberville reported the Houma village to be some six to eight miles inland from the east bank of the Mississippi near the mouth of the Red River.\n\nWhen the Europeans arrived in greater number in the area, they struggled with the language differences among the Native Americans. They thought each Native American settlement represented a different tribe and made errors in their designations of the peoples as a result. The Bayogoula people were, like the Houma, related to and descendants of the Choctaw. In historic times, several bands of Choctaw migrated into the Louisiana area. Descendants today are known as the Jena, Clifton, and Lacombe bands while some, such as the Houma, Bayougoula, and Acolapissa people, were documented as separate tribes.\n\nBy 1700, the Houma were in a border conflict with the Bayougoula over hunting grounds. Mediation by Iberville's brother, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, settled the conflict in March of that year. The tribes placed a tall red pole marked by sacred animal carcasses and feathers in the ground on the bank of a bayou, at a place now known as Scott's Bluff, establishing a new border between their peoples. Called \"Istrouma\" or \"Iti Homma\" by the natives and \"Baton Rouge\" by the French, this marker was at a site some five miles above Bayou Manchac on the east bank of the Mississippi. The area developed as a trading post and the modern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nIn 1706, the Houma migrated south from the Red River region to other areas. One account said they wanted to move closer to their new French allies, concentrated in the New Orleans area, and away from the English-allied tribes to the north. From the 1730s to the French-Indian war (1754–1763) (also known as the Seven Years' War), European wars were played out in North America. Numerous Native American bands formed protective alliances with the Europeans to deal with the conflicts. As early as 1739, the French reported that the Houma, Bayougoula, and Acolapissa were merging into one tribe. Though the tribe remained predominantly Houma, the last remnants of many tribal nations joined them for refuge.\n\nBecause of increasing conflicts among the English, French, and Spanish colonists, the Houma migrated south by the beginning of the 19th century to their current locations in Lafourche and Terrebonne parishes. Oral history and modern scholars agree that they made a settlement called \"Chukunamous\" (meaning roughly Red House). The modern city of Houma, Louisiana was later developed at this site. The tribe moved further south.\n\nHaving lost Saint-Domingue with the success of the slave revolt establishing Haiti, Napoleon ended his North American ambitions and agreed to sell the Louisiana colony to the United States. This doubled the land area of the new republic. On April 30, 1803, the two nations signed a treaty confirming the Louisiana Purchase. With respect to native inhabitants, article six of the Louisiana Purchase Treaty states\n\nThe United States promise to execute such treaties and articles as may have been agreed between Spain and the tribes and nations of Indians, until, by mutual consent of the United States and the said tribes of nations, other suitable articles shall have been agreed upon.\n\nAlthough the United States signed the treaty, they failed to uphold the policy. Dr. John Sibley was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson as US Indian agent for the region. He did not visit any villages in the swamps of southern Louisiana, and the Houma had no official representation to the federal government.\n\nIn 1885, the Houma lost a great leader, Rosalie Courteau. She had helped them survive through the aftermath of the American Civil War. She continues to be highly respected.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the Houma had developed a creole language based on the French language of the former colony. The Houma-French language which the Houma people speak today is a mix between the French spoken by early explorers and Houma words, such as \"shaui\" (\"raccoon\"). Yet, Houma-French language is still a French language, because it can be understood by French speakers from Canada, France, Rwanda or Louisiana. There are some differences in vocabulary, for example, \"chevrette\" to say \"crevette\" (shrimp). The accent of the Houma Nation French-speaker is comparable to the difference between an English-speaker from the United States and an English-speaker from England; every linguistic group develops many different accents.\n\nAs southern Louisiana became more urban and industrialized, the Houma remained relatively isolated in their bayou settlements. The population of the Houma at this time was divided among six other Native American settlements. Travel between settlements was made by \"pirogues\" and the waterways; the state did not build roads connecting the settlements until the 1940s. Like the other Native American populations, the Houma were often subjected to discrimination and isolation.\n\nIn 1907, John R. Swanton, an anthropologist from the Smithsonian Institution, visited the Houma. The Houma continue to have a hunter-gatherer type economy, which he documented, depending on the bayous and swamps for fish and game. They also cultivate small subsistence gardens. Houma members R.J. Molinere, Jr. and his son Jay Paul Molinere are featured hunting alligators on the television program, \"Swamp People\".\n\nAfter white Democrats regained power in Louisiana following the Reconstruction era, they passed laws establishing racial segregation. They had previously classified the Houma and other Native Americans as free people of color and required them to send their children to schools established for the children of freedmen, when available. The state was slow to construct any public schools in Houma settlements. It was not until 1964 after the Civil Rights Act was passed and ended segregation that Houma children were allowed to attend public schools. Before this time, Houma children attended only missionary schools established by religious groups.\n\nThe Houma established a government that includes a role for tribal elders, who operate like a senate. In addition, they have an elected council of representatives and elect a president. That position is held by Principal Chief August \"Cocoa\" Creppel.\n\nThe Houma were granted land by the 1790s on Bayou Terrebonne under the Spanish colonial administration, which had prohibited Indian slavery in 1764. They were never removed to a reservation and, as a small tribe, were overlooked by the federal government during the Indian Removal period of the 1830s. As a people without recognized communal land, in the 20th century, they were considered to have lost their tribal status.\n\nIn addition, since 1808, following United States purchase of Louisiana, state policy required classification of all residents according to a binary system of white and non-white: all Indians in Louisiana were to be classified as free people of color in state records. This was related to the approach of United States slavery states to classify all children born to slave mothers as slaves (and therefore black) regardless of paternity and proportion of other ancestry. During the French colonial period in Louisiana, the term free people of color had applied primarily to people of African-European descent. After US annexation of the territory, its administrators applied this term to all non-whites, including those who identified as Indian. In the early 20th century, the state adopted a \"one-drop rule\" that was even more stringent, classifying anyone with any known African ancestry as black. Many Houma people may have mixed ancestry but identify culturally and ethnically as Houma rather than African American.\n\nRecords of these people are among regular civil parish and church records, and reflect differing jurisdictional designations, rather than lack of stability as a people in this area. Since the mid-20th century, the people identifying as Houma have organized politically, created a government, and have sought federal recognition as a tribe. In 1979 the Houma tribe filed its letter of intent to petition with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Their petition for recognition was rejected in 1994, on the basis that the tribe had lived in disparate settlements. The tribe submitted a response in 1996. The Houma tribe waits for their application to be reviewed again for final determination.\n\nThe Houma have been highly decentralized, with communities scattered over a wide area. The Pointe-Au-Chien Indian Tribe in southern Louisiana and the Biloxi-Chitimacha Confederation of Muskogee have organized and left the United Houma Nation because of feeling too separated from other peoples. They have each achieved state recognition and are independently seeking federal recognition as tribes but have not succeeded as of 2014.\n\nFacing continued criticism of its tribal recognition process as being too stringent in view of US historical issues, in 2013 the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs offered proposed rule changes. Tribes would be required to demonstrate historical continuity since 1934, when Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, granting tribes more power as sovereign nations. Earlier they had been required to demonstrate political continuity as a community from the colonial or settlement period of European contact. Numerous tribes seeking federal recognition had protested that disruption by European-American colonists and settlers were the very factors that caused losses of historic lands and continuity, but that their people could demonstrate continued identification as tribal peoples. In 2014, the Houma were informed by the BIA that their review was in active status under these new guidelines.\n\nThe state of Louisiana officially recognized the United Houma Tribe in 1972.\n\nAs many of tribal communities are in coastal areas and depend on the swamps and bayous as a source of food and economic resource, they have been severely and adversely affected by the continuing coastal erosion and loss of wetlands. Different factors associated with industrialization have contributed to such losses, including dredging of navigation canals by shipping and oil companies, which increased water movement and erosion, increasing salt water intrusion and causing loss of wetlands plants. In addition, oil companies have buried piping under the ground but not covered it sufficiently.\n\nThe community of Isle de Jean Charles has suffered severe erosion; scientists estimate that the island will be lost by 2030 if no restoration takes place. The Houma tribe is looking for land in the area to buy in order to resettle all of the community together. Coastal erosion has adversely affected the quality of fishing. The tribe has suffered from a decrease in fish, as saltwater intrusion has destroyed many of the old fishing holes.\n\nThe Houma people, like many other Native American Tribes within the state and surrounding states, spent many years migrating and shifting. This has left a scattering of ethnic Houma people among many other Native American populations and considerable intermarriage. Over time, the Houma were encouraged to adopt European-style names; in addition, there was considerable marriage by European men and native women. Today most Houma have surnames of European origin, such as Billiot, Verdin, Dardar, Naquin, Gregoire, Parfait, Chaisson, Courteau, Hotard, Solet, Verret, Fitch, Creppel, etc.\n\nIn the beginning days of the organization of the Tribe as it is known today, many Native people of other ethnicities thought they had to enroll with the Houma in order to be classified by the state as Indian. Houma means red in Choctaw, Choctaw being the language from which Mobile Trade Jargon derived. The research necessary for Federal Recognition has helped many find their ancestral tribal identity. The process of documentation of ancestors has given honor to those Houma and other Native Americans who faced much discrimination in the generations before.\n\nToday the Louisiana constitution guarantees all residents the right to learn, teach, speak, read and write in English, French and Houma. In the 1980s, the tribe led a language revival effort; they have done considerable research to reconstruct their lost language. Some of these Houma students have gone to college and become linguists, scientists, musicians, Linux programmers, animators, sociologists, and nurses.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on the riverside of Rio de las Vueltas, within the Los Glaciares National Park (section \"Reserva Nacional Zona Viedma\") near the base of Cerro Torre and Cerro Fitz Roy spires, both popular for climbing. It is 220 km north of El Calafate. It is also a popular base for hiking numerous trails, such as those to the base of surrounding peaks and glacial lakes, such as Laguna Torre and Laguna de los Tres (near the base of Fitz Roy).\n\nFor those reasons, El Chaltén was named Argentina's Trekking Capital or Capital Nacional del Trekking. Today the sole reason for its existence is tourism. In 1985, Argentina and Chile had a border dispute to gain and claim rights over El Chalten. There was no war in the end, and El Chalten was awarded to Argentina. Homes, government buildings, and flags of Argentina went up to mark the city settlement.\n\nThe town is located at the edge of the 12,363 km2 (4,773 sq mi) Southern Patagonian Ice Field and about 350 inhabitants live there throughout all the seasons of the year. Snow and ice mostly fence the town, and the homes are low structured with roads mostly made of rocks and dirt.\nIn October 2014, El Chalten took second place in a ranking of \"Best cities in the world to know\" of the travel guide Lonely Planet publishing in 2015, being the first city of Argentina.\n\n\"\"Chaltén\"\" is a Tehuelche word meaning \"smoking mountain\", as they believe it was a volcano for its peak is most of the time covered by clouds. Other visited tracks and sights are \"Torre Glacier\", \"Laguna Capri\", \"Piedras Blancas Glacier\", \"Chorrillo del Salto\", and \"Laguna de los Tres.\"\n\nIn 1877, Argentine explorer Francisco Moreno named mount Chaltén as mount Fitz Roy, in honour of Robert FitzRoy, captain during the Second voyage of HMS Beagle in the 1830s. Mount Chaltén/Fitz Roy makes the town worth visiting because one can seek the impressive peaks from any area. The whole village finds a gorgeous view that keeps expanding due to the tourism and beautiful location. \n\nThe village provides national park information for visitors, as well as commercial camping (with showers) and a very limited number of beds, catering mostly for backpackers. The most popular hostel in town is La Comarca, located in front of the bus terminal. On the treks outside of the village free campsites are provided and reservations for campsites are not necessary. Some may train for expedition hikes, visit the glaciers, or raft along the rivers. There is currently one automated teller machine, and there is a bank. ( Banco de la Nacion Argentina )\n\nThe number of tourists seems to double each year. Most are people from another country who enjoy climbing mountains, seeing the magnificent Glacier National Park, and most importantly hiking. El Chalten has enormous amounts of trails to explore and take adventures, which makes it the national capital for hiking. South of the Tumbado Mountain, there are hiking trails up to Viento and Lagoon Toro. However, about 100-altitude meters overhead of El Chalten, there are also cliffs with large curves that look out on Condores. There are also high winds that occur often which makes it very dangerous for tourist to hike trails or climb mountains.\n\nThe tourist trade has spawned a few restaurants, bars, supermarkets and shops in town, with a large variety of outdoor equipment for sale, while some of the accommodations provide internet and phone access and show regular movies. Other than that, the town is fairly far removed from the normal flow of news and communication, even during high season (November–February). The town is nearly deserted during the off-season (the southern hemisphere winter).\n\nEl Chaltén has an unpredictable subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen \"Cfc\") with subantarctic continental (\"Dfc\") influences, with precipitation distributed on a large number of days despite not being nearly as heavy as in Chilean Patagonia; bad weather is exceedingly common. Summers experience long daylight hours, very windy weather, and cool temperatures, mostly below during the day and below during the night. Frost can and does occur in the summer too.\nWinters bring snow in moderate quantities, and average temperatures around during the day and during the night; however, the coldest nights are much colder than this. Spring and fall are variable, but generally cold as well.\n\n"}

Despite being a part of a group of many gay Harlem artists, Nugent was among only a few who were publicly out. Recognized initially for the few short stories and paintings that were published, Nugent had a long productive career bringing to light the creative process of gay and black culture.\n\nRichard Bruce Nugent was born in Washington, DC, on July 2, 1906 to Richard H. Nugent, Jr. and Pauline Minerva Bruce. He completed his schooling at Dunbar High School in 1920, and moved to New York following his father's death. After revealing to his mother that he decided to devote his life to only making art she worried about his lack of interest in getting a stable job, so she sent him to Washington, DC, to live with his grandmother. To earn enough money to sustain the family, Nugent would pass as white to earn higher wages. While there, he also experimented with passing, and went by the name Ricardo Nugen di Dosocta, even going as far as giving an address located in the Spanish legation in Washington. In an interview, he claimed he did this for its \"convenience\" as it allowed him to avoid \"bearing the stigma\" of being African American. At that time, he met famous writers like Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson. They became friends, influenced each other's works, and collaborated on works together.\n\nIn 1925 his first works as a writer were published. These included his poem \"Shadow\" and his short story \"Sahdji\". The majority of his life and career took place in Harlem in New York City, and he died of congestive heart failure on May 27, 1987 in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nDuring his career in Harlem, Nugent lived with writer Wallace Thurman from 1926 to 1928, which led to the publishing of \"Smoke, Lilies, and Jade\" in Thurman's publication \"Fire!!\". The short story was written in a modernist stream-of-consciousness style. Its subject matter was bisexuality and more specifically interracial male desire. Before committing his life to his art, Bruce Nugent worked several ordinary jobs, including hat seller, delivery boy, and bellhop. During his time as a bellhop he fell deeply in love with a hotel kitchen employee. It is believed that the character of Beauty from \"Smoke, Lilies and Jade\" is based on this man.\n\nMany of Nugent's illustrations were featured in publications such as \"Fire!!\", along with his short story. Four of his paintings were included in the Harmon Foundation's exhibition of Negro artists, one of the few venues available for black artists in 1931. His only stand-alone publication, \"Beyond Where the Stars Stood Still\", was issued in a limited edition by Warren Marr II in 1945. He married Marr's sister, Grace, on December 5, 1952.\n\nIn the late 1930s Nugent worked with other iconic Harlem Renaissance writers, Claude Mckay and Ralph Ellison, on the Federal Writers Project. In this project he was employed to write biographical sketches.\n\nHis marriage to Grace Marr lasted from 1952 until her suicide in 1969. Due to Nugent's clearly-stated open attraction to other men, his intentions with his marriage to Grace were never clear, as they were not romantic. Thomas Wirth, contemporary and personal friend of Richard Nugent, claimed that Grace loved Richard and was determined to change his sexuality.\n\nNugent attended the Community Planning Conference at Columbia University in 1964 as an invited speaker. The conference was held under the auspices of the Borough President of Manhattan/Community Planning Board 10 and Columbia University. The idea of forming an organization to promote the arts in Harlem emerged from the conference's Cultural Planning workshop and led to the formation of the Harlem Cultural Council. During the 1960s, Nugent and other coworkers founded the Harlem Cultural Council, which sought municipal and federal funds for the arts and mainly worked on construction for the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Nugent also worked as an artist, performer, and commentator. He took an active role in this effort and attended numerous subsequent meetings. He was elected co-chair (a position equivalent to vice president) of this council. He also served as chair of the Program Committee until March 1967.\n\nWhile he was more well known for his writing and illustrations, Nugent also spent many of his years touring as a dancer. He appeared in shows like \"Run, Little Chillun\" (1933) and even toured for two years in a production of \"Porgy\" in 1929. In the 1940s he became a member of the William's Negro Ballet Company. He was also a part of other dance companies, including Hemsley Winfield and Asadata Dafora, even dancing in drag with the New Negro Art Theatre Dance Troupe.\n\nNugent's aggressive and honest approach to homoerotic and interracial desire was not necessarily in the favor of his more discreet homosexual contemporaries. Alain Locke chastised the publication \"Fire!!!\" for its radicalism and specifically Nugent's \"Smoke, Lilies and Jade\" for promoting the effeminacy and decadence associated with homosexual writers.\n\nNugent's friends, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Aaron Douglas, Gwendolyn Bennett, and John P. Davis, all frequented \"Niggerati Manor,\" where they socialized with each other and where the origination of \"Fire!!!\" was based. As well as his friends, Nugent was also influenced by Aaron Douglas and Georgia Douglas Johnson. Their aesthetics were seen in his work. They also helped get his work into various magazines.\n\nNugent's work resurfaced in anthologies such as Michael J. Smith's \"Black Men/White Men: A Gay Anthology\" (1983), and Joseph Beam's interview with Nugent in \"In The Life: A Black Gay Anthology\" (1986). His work, after its resurfacing, brought to light the lifestyle of black gay artists during the Harlem Renaissance. His use of codes made much of his work pass unseen by straight contemporaries, under the disguise of biblical imagery, for example. Nugent bridged the gap between the Harlem Renaissance and the black gay movement of the 1980s, and was a great inspiration to many of his contemporaries.\n\nAlain LeRoy Locke, an African American philosopher, educator and writer, asked Richard Bruce Nugent to contribute to his anthology \"The New Negro\". Nugent drew a picture of \"a washing drawing of an African girl standing in a hut. The doorway of a hut, apparently jangling her bracelets\". Locke liked his picture and suggested that he create a story about it. Therefore, Nugent called the girl \"Sahdji.\" His short story takes place in East Africa and is centered around a small tribe in the area of Warpuri. Sahdji is the beautiful wife of Konombju, the chief of the tribe. However, Sahdji's stepson, Mrabo, is in love with her. Therefore, he hopes his father's death will enable him to take his bride. A devoted supporter of Mrabo named, Numbo, becomes aware of Mrabo's desire for Sahdji. As a gesture of Numbo's respect for Mrabo, Numbo kills Konombju during a hunt. The murder appears to be a hunting accident and the tribe mourns the loss through a funeral ceremony. Mrabo triumphantly awaits his new bride, Sahdji; however, the broken-hearted Sahdji mourns her husband's death and throws her body into his funeral pyre while Mrabo watches. This story was initially interpreted as a gay prose text. However, it is now regarded as an African morality tale which condemns murder, not homosexual love. Locke encouraged him to write the story again, and he created \"Sahdji: An African Ballet\". It premiered at Howard University in the late 1920s and was also produced at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, in the summer of 1932. His works received honorable mentions.\n\n\n\n\"Smoke Lilies & Jade\" is a Bildungsroman (coming-of-age) play by writer Carl Hancock Rux. It is loosely based on Nugent's 1926 short story, \"Smoke, Lilies and Jade\" (as well as elements of Nugent's own life). The play concerns the psychological and moral growth of its protagonist Alex as he reflects on his love for a man named Beauty (a composite character of all the men the protagonist has loved intimately throughout his life) and a woman named Melva (a character loosely based on Nugent's wife, Grace Elizabeth Marr) as well as the relationships, racial injustices and personal tragedies that befell many of his Jazz Age Harlem compatriots. The play was initially commissioned by the Joseph Papp Public Theater and was later produced by the CalArts Center for New Performance.\n\n"}

It was used primarily on Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics (SGI) and IBM RISC workstations, as well as some displays from Apple Computer, NeXT Computer and Intergraph Corporation. The 13W3 connector is no longer used with modern displays; it was superseded for use with analog displays by the VGA connector, and as the display market has moved to digital flat panel displays that has in turn been replaced almost entirely by digital connections (DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort).\n\nThe connector contains 10 standard signal pins and 3 larger positions that can be fitted with either special pins with two concentric contacts for coaxial cable or with special high-current pins. When used for video signals on the computer side, the pins are female but the coaxial connectors in the large positions are male. The coaxial connectors carry the video signal split into red, green/gray, and blue; the standard signal pins carry four grounds, three \"sense\" pins used to communicate with the monitor, vertical sync, horizontal sync, and a composite sync signal.\n\nThe 13W3 connector can be converted into a standard VGA connector using commonly available cables and adapters. This allows multisync monitors, which became prevalent in personal computing in the late 1980s, to be used with these workstations as long as they are sync-on-green compatible. Likewise, later-generation Sun monitors, which began supporting multisync in 1998, can be connected via similar cables to personal computers.\n\nEven though 13W3 is a standard connector, the sync signals are maintained on different pins based on the display and system. Sun, Intergraph, IBM and SGI each use different pin configurations for the monitor sense ID and sync signals. Sun and SGI each even have two different pin configurations: with and without Display Data Channel support. The Sun DDC connector was used at least on the UPA graphics adapters (Creator 3D, Expert 3D) and for their corresponding monitors (GD5410, GD5510). This can make matching the correct cable to the monitor virtually impossible. Many monitors with 13W3 connectors do not support separate sync as supplied on most PC systems. Other converters exist to allow connecting newer monitors with VGA connectors to the older systems and workstations. The most popular of these is a cable with a series of DIP switches built in that can be used to set the sync signals.\n\nA variant of the DB13W3 connector, with high-current pins instead of the high-frequency pins used for video applications, is also used by some 3Com SuperStack Ethernet switches to carry DC power.\n\n\n"}

It was used in the M1867 Remington rolling-block rifles adopted as new standard rifles by the armed forces of Sweden and Norway the same year. Large numbers of older rifles, both Swedish muzzle-loading Model 1860 and breech-loading Model 1864 and Norwegian breech-loading Kammerlader rifles of various models were also converted to rolling block rifles, chambered for the new standard round.\n\nA lengthened version of the round, the 12.17×44mm RF, was adopted by the Norwegian armed forces in 1871. But the two cartridges were interchangeable, and could thus be fired from the same weapons.\n\nThe round, nominally known as 4 Linjers (actual bore diameter 4.1 Swedish decimal lines or 3.88 Norwegian decimal lines, that is 0.41 Swedish or 0.388 Norwegian inches), had a lead bullet 12.615mm (0.497 in) in diameter, with the diameter of the bore, measured between the lands, being 12.17mm (0.479 inches). It used a copper case.\n\nIn Swedish service the standard cartridge used a lead projectile (shaped like a Minié ball) weighing 24 g (370 gr). The muzzle velocity fired through a 955mm (37.6 in) rifle barrel was 386 m/s (1,266 ft/s), with a muzzle energy of 1,788 J (1,319 ft/lbf). Fired through a 460mm (18.11 in) carbine barrel the muzzle velocity was 340 m/s (1,115 ft/s), with a muzzle energy of 1,387 J (1,023 ft/lbf).\n\nIn Norwegian service early rounds had a cast lead projectile weighting 5.85 kvintin (22.8 g/352 gr) and 1 kvintin (3.89 g/60 gr) of gunpowder. Later rounds had a pressed lead projectile weighting 6 kvintin (23.4 g/361 gr) and the gunpowder load was increased to 1.05 kvintin (4.09 g/63 gr).\n\nThere was also a blank round - an ordinary cartridge case loaded with 54 gr (3.50 g) of gunpowder and closed with a cardboard or cork disc.\n\nA civilian/paramilitary centerfire version of the cartridge, the 12.17×44mmR using a brass cartridge case with the same dimensions as the 12.17×44mm RF, was introduced during the 1870s in both Sweden and Norway. The centerfire cartridge could be fired from both Swedish and Norwegian M1867 military Remington rolling-block firearms with only a minor modification, converting the weapon from rimfire to centerfire and vice versa, which could be done by the shooter in the field provided he or she carried the replacement parts. The advantage of the centerfire cartridge was that spent cases could be reloaded, making centerfire ammunition significantly cheaper to use than rimfire ammunition, so the 12.17×44mmR also saw extensive use in Swedish paramilitary service, being used by Frivilliga Skarpskytterörelsen (\"The Volunteer Sharpshooter Movement\"), a voluntary paramilitary organization patterned on the British Volunteer Force and training civilians in the use of arms, with the units raised intended as local defense units (the first such volunteer \"sharpshooter\" units were raised in Stockholm in 1860, with the total number of active members throughout Sweden reaching 40,000 in 1865; volunteer \"sharpshooter\" units were armed with military M1867 rifles modified to use the 12.17×44mmR centerfire cartridge, and wore military-style uniforms).\n\nThe 12.17×42mm RF is also known as \"12,17mm patron m/1867\" and \"12×42RF Swedish Remington Model 1867\".<br>The 12.17×44mm RF is also known as \"12×44RF Norwegian Remington Model 1871\" and \"12.7×44RF Norwegian\".<br>The 12.17×44mm R is also known as \"12×44R Swedish Remington\", \".50 Swedish/Norwegian Remington\" and \"12.7×44R\".\n\nMany Remington Rolling Blocks were converted to use the centerfire 12.17×44mmR cartridge or rebuilt to shotguns. Many of these guns still exist and are still used by black-powder enthusiasts both for competition and hunting. Centerfire 12.17×44mmR cases are available, but a more cost-effective way to acquire cases is to cut, shape and fire-form .348 Winchester cases.\n\n\n"}

It typically occurs in newborns that are either premature or otherwise unwell. Symptoms may include poor feeding, bloating, decreased activity, blood in the stool, or vomiting of bile.\nThe exact cause is unclear. Risk factors include congenital heart disease, birth asphyxia, exchange transfusion, and premature rupture of membranes. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a combination of poor blood flow and infection of the intestines. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and confirmed with medical imaging.\nPrevention includes the use of breast milk and probiotics. Treatment includes bowel rest, orogastric tube, intravenous fluids, and intravenous antibiotics. Surgery is required in those who have free air in the abdomen. A number of other supportive measures may also be required. Complications may include short-gut syndrome, intestinal strictures, or developmental delay.\nAbout 7% of those that are born premature develop necrotizing enterocolitis. Onset is typically in the first four weeks of life. Among those affected, about 25% die. The sexes are affected equally frequently. The condition was first described in between 1888 and 1891.\n\nThe condition is typically seen in premature infants, and the timing of its onset is generally inversely proportional to the gestational age of the baby at birth (i.e., the earlier a baby is born, the later signs of NEC are typically seen).\n\nInitial symptoms include feeding intolerance and failure to thrive, increased gastric residuals, abdominal distension and bloody stools. Symptoms may progress rapidly to abdominal discoloration with intestinal perforation and peritonitis and systemic hypotension requiring intensive medical support.\n\nThe exact cause is unclear. Risk factors include congenital heart disease, birth asphyxia, exchange transfusion, and premature rupture of membranes.\n\nThe diagnosis is usually suspected clinically but often requires the aid of diagnostic imaging modalities, most commonly radiography. Specific radiographic signs of NEC are associated with specific Bell's stages of the disease:\n\n\nUltrasonography has proven to be useful as it may detect signs and complications of NEC before they are evident on radiographs, specifically in cases that involve a paucity of bowel gas, a gasless abdomen, or a sentinel loop. Diagnosis is ultimately made in 5–10% of very low-birth-weight infants (<1,500g).\n\nPrevention includes the use of breast milk and probiotics. A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of two or more.\n\nSmall amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. The gut mucosal cells do not get enough nourishment from arterial blood supply to stay healthy, especially in very premature infants, where the blood supply is limited due to immature development of the capillaries, so nutrients from the lumen of the gut are needed.\n\nTowards understanding intervention with human milk, experts have noted cow and human milk differ in their immunoglobular and glycan compositions. Due to their relative ease of production, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are a subject of particular interest in supplementation and intervention.\n\nA Cochrane review in 2014 found that supplementation of probiotics enterally \"prevents severe NEC as well as all-cause mortality in preterm infants.\"\n\nAdvancing enteral feed volumes at lower rates does not appear to reduce the risk of NEC or death in very preterm infants. Not beginning feeding an infant by mouth for more than 4 days does not appear to have protective benefits.\n\nTreatment consists primarily of supportive care including providing bowel rest by stopping enteral feeds, gastric decompression with intermittent suction, fluid repletion to correct electrolyte abnormalities and third-space losses, support for blood pressure, parenteral nutrition, and prompt antibiotic therapy.\n\nMonitoring is clinical, although serial supine and left lateral decubitus abdominal X-rays should be performed every six hours.\n\nAs an infant recovers from NEC, feeds are gradually introduced. \"Trophic feeds\" or low-volume feeds (<20 ml/kg/day) are usually initiated first. How and what to feed are determined by the extent of bowel involved, the need for surgical intervention and the infant's clinical appearance.\n\nWhere the disease is not halted through medical treatment alone, or when the bowel perforates, immediate emergency surgery to resect the dead bowel is generally required, although abdominal drains may be placed in very unstable infants as a temporizing measure. Surgery may require a colostomy, which may be able to be reversed at a later time. Some children may suffer from short bowel syndrome if extensive portions of the bowel had to be removed.\n\nIn the case of an infant whose bowel is left in discontinuity, the surgical creation of a mucous fistula or connection to the distal bowel may be helpful as this allows for re-feeding of ostomy output to the distal bowel. This re-feeding process is believed to improve bowel adaptation and aid in advancement of feeds.\n\nTypical recovery from NEC if medical, non-surgical treatment succeeds, includes 10–14 days or more without oral intake and then demonstrated ability to resume feedings and gain weight. Recovery from NEC alone may be compromised by co-morbid conditions that frequently accompany prematurity. Long-term complications of medical NEC include bowel obstruction and anemia.\n\nIn the United States of America it caused 355 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013, down from 484 per 100,000 live births in 2009. Rates of death were almost three times higher for the black populations than for the white populations.\n\nOverall, about 70-80% of infants who develop NEC survive. Medical management of NEC shows an increased chance of survival compared to surgical management. Despite a significant mortality risk, long-term prognosis for infants undergoing NEC surgery is improving, with survival rates of 70–80%. \"Surgical NEC\" survivors are at risk for complications including short bowel syndrome and neurodevelopmental disability.\n"}

Estimates of the number of families in Canada and the United States descended from Marin Boucher run as high as 350,000, although most of them do not bear the name Boucher today because Marin's line produced more daughters than sons.\n\nMarin Boucher was born in Mortagne, Perche province, France about 1587 and died on 25 March 1671 in Château-Richer, Canada, New France.\n\nHe married twice: (1) to Julienne Baril ( 1574 - 1627) in 1611 and (2) to Perrine Maillet (1604-1687) before 1630. Marin and Julienne had seven children, one of whom traveled to Canada; Marin and Perrine had seven more children, five of whom were born in Canada.\n\nThe Bouchers were stonemasons and carpenters, skills which were valuable in the early colony. Because of some work done for Samuel de Champlain, the Founder of the colony, Marin Boucher was deeded Champlain's clothes in his will when he died. He was also a witness in a dispute over stolen property in which his relation Gaspard Boucher was the plaintiff.\n\nMarin Boucher's sister, Jeanne Boucher, married Thomas Hayot (spellings vary: Hayot; Ayot; Ayotte, etc.) who was also an early settler and founder of a distinguished Québec family.\n\nGaspard Boucher was another close relation who emigrated to New France, believed by some researchers to have been Marin's brother, though more likely his cousin. Gaspard Boucher was father of Pierre Boucher Seigneur of Boucherville, and founder of the parish and township of Boucherville, across the Saint-Laurent River from Montreal. Pierre Boucher became Governor of Trois-Rivières and a Royal Judge, was ennobled, and settled on his \"seigneurie\", where he founded a model \"seigneurie\", village and Parish which is now a suburban satellite of Montreal.\n\nThe Bouchers arrived as part of the Percheron immigration movement, consisting of a mix of families and single individual from the region of Perche, at the time part of Maine province, brought over to New France in 1634 to colonize Beauport, a \"seigneurie\" granted to Robert Giffard, physician to the colony. Marin Boucher and his son François migrated aboard the ship \"St-Jehan\" under the command of Captain Pierre Nesle, which arrived in Quebec on June 4, 1634. His wife and younger children arrived the following year.\n\nThe colonists were temporarily housed in the Habitation (Fort St-Louis), the fort and residence built by Samuel de Champlain at Quebec in 1608, before moving to their land concessions at Beauport, a short distance down river from Quebec.\n\nGaspard Boucher may have arrived with his family separately in 1635 according to the \"memoires\" of his son, Sieur Pierre Boucher de Boucherville.\n\nMarin Boucher and his family subsequently moved to the South Shore where they were pioneers of the town of Rivière-Ouelle. The town was attacked during King William's War by a party led by Sir William Phips in October 1690, and Marin's son, Jean-Galleran was among the 39 \"Heroes of Rivière-Ouelle\" who defended the town. Phips, whose troops had been pillaging along the coast of the St-Laurent on their way to lay siege to Québec City, was repulsed by the ambush, and later was unsuccessful in his attack on Québec.\n\nGenealogical information on the Bouchers can be found in the works of Abbé Cyprien Tanguay; Abbé Archange Godbout; René Jetté; and other standard reference works on French Canadian genealogy.\n\nTwo early settlers of Acadia are believed to be descended from Marin Boucher of New France, including a Jaques Boucher who shows up in a 1700 census of Port Royale (in present-day Nova Scotia), and a Pierre Boucher who went to Grand Pré and married Anne Hebert on or around 1714. There are several other lines of Bouchers, including that of Jean Boucher (born on or around 1650 in St-Etienne du Bourg de Chaix, France), in Quebec. There are descendants of Marin Boucher in Massachusetts, California, Florida, etc. There are also Bouchers descended from Marin Boucher in Louisiana, either of Acadian (Cadien or Cajun) descent or more directly descended from the Canadian (Quebec) lines.\n\nWith the other early pioneers, Marin Boucher and his wife are commemorated by a plaque in Quebec City.\n\nMarin's nephew (or cousin, depending upon the source), Pierre Boucher, is commemorated by a statue on the Assemblée Nationale, the Provincial Legislature Building in Quebec City, and in a stained glass window in a church in Mortagne, Perche.\n\nA number of places and streets are named after various members of the Boucher family.\n\n\n"}

It is the ninth verse of the Sermon on the Mount. Some consider this verse to be the beginning of the last Beatitude, but most disagree. They see it as more of an expansion on the eighth and final Beatitude in the previous verse.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:11\n\nWhile this verse begins with the same \"blessed are\" opening of the previous eight Beatitudes it quickly varies from them in structure. It shifts from the third to the second person and abandons the simple virtue/reward structure. It is thus generally not seen as a ninth Beatitude, but as a commentary on the eighth Beatitude directed to the disciples. Schweizer feels this verse and the next were a late addition clarifying the previous verse. It expands on what type of persecution will be faced, and also is more explicit on the eventual reward. France feels it might also integrate elements from . It also is somewhat similar to , and both may be drawn from the same original source.\n\nThis verse is also seen to give important information about the Christians at the time the Gospel was written. The discussion of the persecution of Christians, which did not begin until some time after Jesus' crucifixion, to most scholars is evidence that this is the period the Gospel of Matthew was written in. Other believers feel that Jesus is merely accurately predicting the events that will unfold after his death. The Gospel of Matthew refers to only verbal attacks, and this was likely the main form of abuse suffered by the Christians at this time. Schweizer notes that slander and insults were of great importance in that era. Verbal attacks meant that the Christians were ostracized from their communities, and in that era community support was essential to survival. Gundry notes that Luke has excommunication as one of the forms of persecution, perhaps indicating the differences in situation between the writings of the two Gospels.\n\nThe verse is careful to note that the persecuted are blessed only when they are reproached and slandered falsely. Schweizer notes that the early Christian communities had problem with impostors only pretending to be Christian who might have been worthy of reproach by others.\n"}

They are predominantly brownish in colour but can vary. Smaller individuals may be greenish in colour and display faint vertical stripes. The rostrum is very prominent and contains 11 to 14 dorsal teeth and 8 to 11 ventral teeth. The first pair of walking legs (pereiopods) are elongated and very thin, ending in delicate claws (chelipeds) which are used as feeding appendages. The second pair of walking legs are much larger and powerful, especially in males. The movable claws of the second pair of walking legs are distinctively covered in dense bristles (setae) that give it a velvety appearance. The color of the claws in males varies according to their social dominance.\n\nFemales can be distinguished from males by their wider abdomens and smaller second pereiopods. The genital openings are found on the body segments containing the fifth pereiopods and the third pereiopods in males and females, respectively.\n\nThree different morphotypes of males exist. The first stage is called \"small male\" (SM); this smallest stage has short, nearly translucent claws. If conditions allow, small males grow and metamorphose into \"orange claws\" (OC), which have large orange claws on their second chelipeds, which may have a length of 0.8 to 1.4 times their body size. OC males later may transform into the third and final stage, the \"blue claw\" (BC) males. These have blue claws, and their second chelipeds may become twice as long as their bodies.\n\nMales of \"M. rosenbergii\" have a strict hierarchy: the territorial BC males dominate the OCs, which in turn dominate the SMs. The presence of BC males inhibits the growth of SMs and delays the metamorphosis of OCs into BCs; an OC will keep growing until it is larger than the largest BC male in its neighbourhood before transforming. All three male stages are sexually active, and females that have undergone their premating moult will co-operate with any male to reproduce. BC males protect the female until their shells have hardened; OCs and SMs show no such behaviour.\n\nIn mating, the male deposits spermatophores on the underside of the female's thorax, between the walking legs. The female then extrudes eggs, which pass through the spermatophores. The female carries the fertilised eggs with her until they hatch; the time may vary, but is generally less than three weeks. Females lay 10,000–50,000 eggs up to five times per year.\n\nFrom these eggs hatch zoeae, the first larval stage of crustaceans. They go through several larval stages before metamorphosing into postlarvae, at which stage they are long and resemble adults. This metamorphosis usually takes place about 32 to 35 days after hatching. These postlarvae then migrate back into fresh water.\n\n\n"}

The term connotes scarcity or exclusivity. The higher the quantity printed the less likely the book will become scarce and thus increase in value. Limited editions were introduced by publishers in the late 19th century. \n\nThe term also implies that no further additional printings of the book with the same design treatment will take place, unlike open-ended trade editions wherein further copies may be released in more print runs as the first and subsequent printings sell out.\n\nLimited-edition books may also be numbered or lettered to distinguish in that set each book. For example, a numbered, limited book could have a marking such as \"Copy 1 of a limited edition of 250 copies\" or \"1/250\". Much less common is the lettered limited-edition book that could have denotations such as \"1 of 26\" or \"1/26\" or \"A of 26\" or \"Copy A\", etc. Sometimes a copy of a limited-edition book is stated as being \"out of series\": this is an unnumbered copy, often a review copy.\n\nLimited-edition books are also sometimes signed by the author, illustrator and/or other contributors to make them more exclusive and collectible. In some instances, the limited-edition version contains additional material not found in the mass-market (or trade) version of the book. Likewise, they are sometimes housed in slipcases.\n\n"}

{"id": "2183884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183884", "title": "Push Access Protocol", "text": "Push Access Protocol\n\nPush Access Protocol (or PAP) is a protocol defined in WAP-164 of the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) suite from the Open Mobile Alliance. PAP is used for communicating with the Push Proxy Gateway, which is usually part of a WAP Gateway.\n\nPAP is intended for use in delivering content from Push Initiators to Push Proxy Gateways for subsequent delivery to narrow band devices, including mobile phones and pagers. Example messages include news, stock quotes, weather, traffic reports, and notification of events such as email arrival. With Push functionality, users are able to receive information without having to request it. In many cases it is important for the user to get the information as soon as it is available.\n\nThe Push Access Protocol is not intended for use over the air.\n\nPAP is designed to be independent of the underlying transport protocol. PAP specifies the following possible operations between the Push Initiator and the Push Proxy Gateway:\n\n\nThe interaction between the Push Initiators and the Push Proxy Gateways is in the form of XML messages.\n\nThe purpose of the Push Submission is to deliver a Push message from a Push Initiator to a PPG, which should then deliver the message to a user agent in a device on the wireless network. The Push message contains a control entity and a content entity, and MAY contain a capabilities entity. The control entity is an XML document that contains control information (push-message) for the PPG to use in processing the message for delivery. The content entity represents content to be sent to the wireless device. The capabilities entity contains client capabilities assumed by the Push Initiator and is in the RDF [RDF] format as defined in the User Agent Profile [UAPROF]. The PPG MAY use\nthe capabilities information to validate that the message is appropriate for the client. The response to the push request is an XML document (push-response, section 9.3) that indicates initial acceptance or failure. At minimum the PPG MUST validate against the DTD [XML] the control entity in the message and report the result in the response. The PPG MAY indicate, using progress-note (if requested by the Push initiator in the progress-notes-requested attribute), that other validations have been completed. The contents and number of progress-notes are implementation specific. A typical response message may contain progress notes for each stage of internal processing. The processing stages used are implementation specific. There are provisions in the Push message to specify multiple recipients. The response message corresponds to the submit message, so there is one response message for one push message, regardless of the number of addresses specified. If the Push Initiator desires information related to the final outcome of the delivery, then it MUST request a result notification information in the push submission and provide a return address (e.g. URL).\n\nThis operation is used by the PPG to inform the initiator of the final outcome of a push submission, if requested by the Push Initiator. This notification (arrow 5, below) tells the Push Initiator that the message was sent (transmitted, as in arrow 3), delivered (confirmation received from wireless device, as in arrow 4), it expired, was cancelled, or there was an error. If there was a processing error, the notification SHOULD be sent immediately upon detection of the error to the Push Initiator and the message should not be sent to the client. Otherwise, the notification MUST be sent after the message delivery process has been completed. The delivery process is considered completed when the message is no longer a candidate for delivery, e.g. the message has expired. If the push submission is indicated as rejected in step two in figure 3, then no result notification will be sent. The Push Initiator MUST have provided a return address (e.g. URL) during the push operation for this notification to be possible.\n\nThe purpose of the Push Cancellation is to allow the Push Initiator to attempt to cancel a previously submitted push message. The Push Initiator initiates this operation. The PPG responds with an indication of whether the request was successful or not.\n\nThe status query operation allows the Push Initiator to request the current status of a message that has been previously submitted. If status is requested for a message which is addressed to multiple recipients, the PPG MUST send back a single response containing status query results for each of the recipients.\n\nThis operation allows the Push Initiator to query the PPG for the capabilities of a specific device. The response is a multipart/related document containing the ccq-response (section 9.11) element in an XML document and, in the\nsecond entity, the actual client capabilities information in RDF [RDF] as defined in the User Agent Profile [UAPROF]. The PPG MAY add to the capabilities reported if the PPG is willing to perform transformations to the formats supported by the client. For example, if a client has JPG support but not GIF and a PPG is willing to convert GIF files to JPG, then the PPG may report that the client can support JPG and GIF files. The capabilities reported may be the combined PPG and client capabilities and they may have been derived from session capabilities or retrieved from a CC/PP server. Capabilities may also be derived using implementation dependent means.\n\nThere are three addresses to be considered by the Push Initiator: the push proxy gateway address, the wireless device address, and the result notification address. The push proxy gateway address must be known by the Push Initiator. This address is needed at the layer below the push access protocol. The push proxy gateway is addressed using a unique address that depends on the underlying protocol. For example, when the underlying protocol is HTTP, a URL [RFC1738] is used. The device addressing information is included as part of the message content (XML tagged content). Any character allowed in an RFC822 address may appear in the device address field. In addition, a “notify-requested-to” address may be provided by the Push Initiator when required so that the push proxy gateway can later respond to the Push Initiator with result notification.\n\nThere are scenarios in which a Push Initiator may want to send identical messages to multiple recipients. Rather than submitting multiple identical push messages, one to each recipient, the Push Initiator may submit a single push message addressed to multiple recipients. This section is intended to clarify behaviour related to operations on multiple recipients. When the PPG returns the push-response message, after a push submission to multiple recipients, the response corresponds to the message, regardless of the number of recipients specified in the push submission (there is one response for each push submission). When a Push Initiator requests status (section 9.8) with multiple addresses specified, the PPG MUST reply with a single statusquery-response (section 9.9) containing the individual statuses. The same is true when only a push-id is specified (no address specified) in the query for status of a multiple recipient message. Result notifications (section 9.6) MUST be sent by the PPG for each individual recipient, if result notification is requested by the Push Initiator during the submission of a message to multiple recipients. In cases where a message is sent to multiple recipients and later a cancel is requested by the initiator, the PPG MAY send back individual responses related to each of the multiple recipients or it MAY send responses related to many or all of the recipients. Support of multiple addresses is OPTIONAL in a PPG.\n\nThere are scenarios in which a single address submitted by a PI may be expanded by a PPG into multiple addresses for delivery. In addition, a single address transmitted on a wireless network may be received by multiple devices (e.g. broadcast). This type of service is expected for the distribution of information of interest to a broad population (e.g. news, weather, and traffic). This section is intended to clarify behaviour related to operations involving multicast and broadcast addresses. Since the address expansion is done in the PPG or in the wireless network, the behaviour between the PI and the PPG is identical to behaviour as if the address were not expanded. The response contains the individual address as submitted by the PI.\n\nThe push access protocol is independent of the transport used. PAP messages carry control information, and in the case of a push submission, also content and optionally client capabilities information. Control information includes command/response messages between the PPG and the Push Initiator, and parameters passed to the PPG for use in sending content to the wireless device. Examples of this type of information include the wireless device address, the delivery priority of the message, etc. This information is not normally delivered to the wireless device. Content is information that is intended for the wireless device. This information might be intelligible only to the wireless device (e.g. may be encrypted by the Push Initiator or may be application data for an application unknown to the PPG) or it may be recognisable by the PPG (e.g. HTML or WML). The PPG may be configured to perform some transformation on recognisable content (e.g. HTML to WML) for certain wireless devices. The other category of information is client capability information as specified in the User Agent Profile [UAPROF]. When more than control is carried in a message, the format of the message is a MIME multipart/related [RFC2387] compound object. When only control information (e.g. for message responses) is carried in a message, the format of the\nmessage is a simple application/xml entity. All information is transported within a single message body. In the multipart messages, the first entity contains all push related control information in an XML document, the second entity contains the content for the wireless device, the third entity, if present, contains UAPROF client capabilities. The format of the content entity is specified in [PushMsg].\n\nThe control entity is a MIME body part which holds an XML document containing one pap element as defined in section 9.1. The control entity MUST be included in every PAP request and response. The control entity MUST be the first entity in the MIME multipart/related message.\n\nThe content entity is a MIME body part containing the content to be sent to the wireless device. The content type is not defined by the PAP, but can be any type as long as it is described by MIME. The content entity is included only in the push submission and is not included in any other operation request or response. The content entity MUST be the second entity in the MIME multipart/related message.\n\nThe capabilities entity is a MIME body part containing the Push Initiator's assumed subset of the capabilities of the wireless device/user agent. The capabilities format is specified in the User Agent Profile [UAPROF]. The capabilities entity, if present, MUST be the third entity in the Push Submission MIME multipart/related message and MUST be the second entity in a Client Capabilities Query response.\n\n"}

Cooper spent most of his playing career at Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest. Prior to his appointment at Hartlepool, Cooper was part of the Middlesbrough coaching staff after leaving his role of assistant manager at Bradford City.\n\nHe played as a centre back, but was equally useful at full-back. He spent the first seven years of his professional career contracted to Middlesbrough, making 188 league appearances and scoring six league goals in the process. During this time, he helped Middlesbrough through liquidation in 1986.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, he was transferred to Division Two side (renamed Division One and then the Football League Championship) Millwall for the sum of £300,000 spending two successful seasons at The Den.\n\nAfter impressing several big name clubs, he decided to move to Nottingham Forest in 1993 for £1,700,000. It was at Forest where Colin arguably played the best football of his career, his form earning him two England caps in 1995.\n\nAfter experiencing the joys of two promotions and the heart-break of a relegation, \"Super Coops\" was re-purchased by his first club, Middlesbrough, in a £2,500,000 deal. Many people questioned the signing of the stalwart from Nottingham Forest, but Colin proved to many people that he was more than capable of playing Premier League football. He maintained a consistent level of play throughout the seven years that he spent with Middlesbrough, and could always be relied upon to do a job. He almost gave up the game in 2002 after his son, Finlay, died in an accident at the family home just hours after their victory over Manchester United in the FA Cup. In 2003–04, he spent some time on loan with Sunderland. Cooper was part of Middlesbrough's 2004 League Cup-winning team. Despite not making the squad for the final he appeared in the earlier rounds.\n\nIn 2005, Cooper was awarded a one-year contract extension, which saw him play at the age of 39. His final season with Middlesbrough, 2005–06, saw Boro reach the 2006 UEFA Cup Final. However, he made just one appearance all campaign, coming on as a late substitute on the last day of the season against Fulham.\n\nCooper made his England international debut in a 3–3 draw against Sweden. He gained two caps for the England national team and made 8 for the Under-21 side where he finished runners-up with the U21s in the 1988 Tournoi Espoirs de Toulon tournament.\n\nAfter he retired from playing, in June 2006, Cooper was officially given a job with the Middlesbrough coaching staff, as the Reserve team coach. Following Steve Round's departure from the club in December 2006, Cooper was promoted to a more active role with the first team. Following the departure of Malcolm Crosby on 17 June 2009, Cooper was promoted to assistant manager at Middlesbrough. On 22 October 2009, following the departure of manager Gareth Southgate, Cooper was appointed caretaker manager at Middlesbrough. However, he was only employed in this position for four days, as Gordon Strachan was announced as the new manager on 26 October. Cooper's solitary match in charge was a 2–2 draw with Preston North End on 24 October 2009. In May 2010, Cooper was relieved of all duties at Middlesbrough by Strachan.\n\nOn 9 March 2011, Cooper was appointed as assistant to interim manager Peter Jackson at League Two side Bradford City. Jackson was subsequently appointed full-time manager on 25 May 2011, but he resigned on 25 August 2011, resulting in Cooper taking over as caretaker manager. winning his first game 4–2 against Barnet. Phil Parkinson was appointed as Jackson's permanent successor, and on 8 September 2011, Cooper left Bradford to rejoin Middlesbrough and take up a coaching role with Middlesbrough's under-18 side.\n\nOn 24 May 2013, he became manager at Football League Two side Hartlepool United, replacing John Hughes, who had been sacked the previous month. He named fellow ex-Middlesbrough player Craig Hignett as his assistant manager. After winning four out of five league games in October, Cooper won the Sky Bet League Two Manager of the Month Award.\n\nCooper resigned as Hartlepool United manager on 4 October 2014, after a 3–0 home defeat by Carlisle United, which left the club at the bottom of the League Two table.\n\nCooper was a regular guest on the ITV late night football review programme \"Soccer Night\", which was hosted by Roger Tames. During this programme, three legendary figures, representing one of each of the North-East's top three clubs (Middlesbrough, Sunderland, and Newcastle United), come to the studio and discuss recent footballing events.\n\nIn 2006, Colin and his wife Julie, formed the charity the Finlay Cooper Fund, named after his son who died in a tragic accident in 2002, which raises money for children's causes. In 2013, Colin and 12 others (which included Craig Hignett and Jeff Stelling) climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for charity; the climb raised £100,000.\n\n\"Statistics for league appearances only\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term Craft production refers to a manufacturing technique applied in the hobbies of handicraft but was also the common method of manufacture in the pre-industrialized world, such as in the production of pottery.\n\nIn the craft manufacturing process, the final product is unique. While the product may be of extremely high quality, the uniqueness can be detrimental as seen in the case of early automobiles.\n\nWomack, Jones and Roos in the book \"The Machine That Changed the World\" detailed that early automobiles were craft produced. Because each vehicle was unique, replacement parts had to be manufactured from scratch or at least customized to fit a specific vehicle. The advent of Mass production and the standardized, interchangeable parts guaranteed a parts' compatibility with a variety of vehicle models.\n\nMass production has many drawbacks to craft production, including that production quality can be lower than a craft-produced item. For example, in some mass-production automobile manufacturing facilities, craftsmen rework flawed, mass-produced vehicles to give the appearance of a quality product.\n\nLean manufacturing aims to bring back or exceed the quality of craft production and remedy the inefficiency of mass production through the elimination of waste.\n\nCraft production is a part of the informal economy in many cities, such as Istanbul, Turkey where the informal craft economy is a vital source of income for the Turkish craftspeople. Craft markets are highly dependent on social interactions, and verbal training which results in variations in the goods produced. Often, the craft economy consists of craft neighbourhoods, by which a community is structured on the craft activity present in the area.\n\nOften used in the household, many craft goods such as historic Mumun Pottery in Korea, originated from the need for economic alternatives to meet household needs. Changes in the craft economies have often coincided with changes in household organization, and social transformations, as in Korea in the Early to Middle Mumun Period.\n\nGiven that craft production requires an intimate knowledge of methods of production from an experienced individual of that craft, the connection between trades people is highly evident in craft communities. The production of many crafts have a high technical demand, and therefore require full-time specialization of the skill-set in the form of workshops, or verbal, hands-on training. The verbal interaction between teacher and student encourages strong social bonds, which ultimately leads to cohesive communities, typical of modern day craft communities.\n\nCraft economies are highly related to place. Craft-specialization explores how portable goods are integral to the social relations of a community, and links groups of people together through the creation of tangible items.\n\nPlaces where craft economic activity is taking place indicate strong linkages between sociopolitical organization and societal complexity. These communities are often tight-knit, with strong linkages to materials produced and sold, as well as mutual respect for fellow tradesmen in the market place.\n\n"}

He served as bishop of the Diocese of Davenport from 1927–1944 and as coadjutor archbishop and archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque from 1944–1954.\n\nRohlman was born in Appelhuelsen, Westphalia (present day Germany), to Bernard and Bernadine (Hussman) Rohlman. When he was two years old his family immigrated to the United States and settled in Carroll County, Iowa. They moved to Arkansas where both of his parents died. Henry was moved to Nebraska where he finished elementary school and worked on a farm. Through the generosity of people from Carroll County he studied in the high school department at St. Lawrence Seminary, Mount Calvary, Wisconsin, and graduated from Columbia College, now Loras College, in Dubuque. He studied for the priesthood at the Grand séminaire de Montréal and was ordained a priest by Archbishop Paul Bruchesi in Montreal for the Archdiocese of Dubuque on December 21, 1901.\n\nRohlman engaged in pastoral work in Dubuque before attending The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., with a view to becoming a missionary. When he returned to Dubuque he was assigned to the Apostolate, which preached parish missions in the archdiocese as well as in the other dioceses in Iowa. He became pastor at St. Mary's Church in Waterloo before serving as business manager at Columbia College. In the early 1920s, Rohlman was asked to form Nativity parish in Dubuque.\nOn May 20, 1927, Pope Pius XI named Rohlman the fourth bishop of the Diocese of Davenport. Rohlman was consecrated by Archbishop James Keane of Dubuque in St. Raphael's Cathedral on July 25, 1927. He was installed the next day as Bishop of Davenport in Sacred Heart Cathedral. The principal co-consecrators were Bishops Edmond Heelan of Sioux City and Thomas Drumm of Des Moines.\n\nIn 1928 Bishop Rohlman commissioned a study to assess the social problems in the diocese. The result of this study was the establishment of Catholic Charities in 1929. He named the Rev. Martin Cone as its first director. Its immediate focus was the welfare of the children at St. Vincent's Home in Davenport.\nTwo colleges for women were started in the diocese during Bishop Rohlman's episcopate. The Sisters of St. Francis in Clinton established Mt. St. Clare College (later Ashford University) in 1928. It was an extension of their academy, which had been established in the 1890s. St. Ambrose College started a woman's division in 1934 and continued to support it as it searched for a religious order of women to take it over. In 1937 property was secured for a woman's college in Davenport on the west side of the city. The Congregation of the Humility of Mary at Rohlman's urging established Marycrest College in 1939 from the woman's division of St. Ambrose.\n\nThe diocese celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1931. The next year Bishop Rohlman convoked the diocese's third synod. The synod was called to bring the diocese's regulations in line with the Code of Canon Law which had been promulgated in 1917. It also set the salary for pastors at $1,000 per year, plus household expenses, and associate pastors and chaplain's salaries were set at $500. Catholic Charities had set up their offices in the Kahl Building. They were joined in 1932 with the chancery and the newly established superintendent of schools. All of these offices and the bishop's office moved into a property on Church Square behind St. Anthony's Church downtown. It was renamed the Cosgrove Building after Davenport's second bishop, Henry Cosgrove.\n\nRohlman had the difficult task of leading the diocese through the Great Depression and World War II. The \"Catholic Messenger\", an independent Catholic newspaper published in Davenport, was experiencing financial problems during the Depression and was purchased by the diocese for use as a diocesan newspaper in 1937. A national edition to the paper was still published in addition to a diocesan edition for a couple decades after its purchase. The \"Messenger\" moved its offices into the Cosgrove Building, until they moved across the street into the Democrat Building.\n\nUntil Bishop Rohlman came to the diocese only five priests had been recognized for their contributions to the church by being given a papal honor, all of them from Bishop Davis. Rohlman named monsignors every two years. By the time he returned to Dubuque, twenty-four priests had been honored and five were recognized twice. Bishop Rohlman served as Bishop of Davenport for 17 years until September 8, 1944, when he was named to Dubuque.\n\nDuring the early 1940s, Archbishop Francis Beckman of Dubuque had involved the archdiocese in a dubious financial scheme. Beckman had been talked into investing borrowed money in gold mines with the idea that the profits could be used to further an art collection he had established at Columbia College. However, the scheme was soon revealed to be a fraud, and the man behind the scheme was arrested. Because Beckman had signed loans in the archdiocese's name, it led to financial difficulties for the archdiocese when the holders of the notes began demanding repayment. Because of the financial problems surrounding Beckman, Bishop Rohlman was transferred to Dubuque by Pope Pius XII and named Titular Archbishop of \"Macra\" and Coadjutor Archbishop of Dubuque. It was made clear to Beckman that while he retained the title \"Archbishop of Dubuque\", Rohlman was now the leader of the archdiocese. On November 11, 1946, Archbishop Beckman retired from office and left Dubuque. Rohlman automatically became the seventh bishop and fifth archbishop of Dubuque.\n\nWhile Rohlman was archbishop, Christ the King Chapel was constructed at Loras College, St. Mary's Home for Children was built in Dubuque, and the number of priests in the archdiocese rose from 290 to 345. Rohlman, along with the other bishops in Iowa, re-established Mt. St Bernard's Seminary for the education of new priests in the province. A new $2.5 million building was constructed to house the seminary in Dubuque.\n\nOn August 10, 1945, the Diocese of Omaha was elevated to an archdiocese. At that time the Province of Dubuque was reduced in size to the four dioceses in the state of Iowa.\n\nOn August 3, 1946, Pope Pius XII appointed a Dubuque priest, Edward Fitzgerald, as the first auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese. He assisted Rohlman until he was appointed Bishop of Winona on October 20, 1949.\n\nIn 1949, Rohlman requested a coadjutor archbishop. Bishop Leo Binz of Winona was transferred to Dubuque, and Rohlman continued to serve as archbishop until his resignation was accepted by Pope Pius XII on December 2, 1954. He was named the Titular Archbishop of \"Cotrada\" and Archbishop Emeritus. Rohlman is buried in the mortuary chapel at St. Raphael's Cathedral.\n\nThere are two residence halls named Rohlman Hall after the Archbishop, one at Loras College in Dubuque and one at St. Ambrose University in Davenport. The former Marycrest College in Davenport also named a building in his honor.\n\n"}

After qualifying as a doctor, he started his career in the Indonesian Navy and retired with the rank of rear admiral. He then served as General Secretary of the Department of Religious Affairs for 5 years, before being appointed as Minister in 1993. After leaving his ministerial position, Taher has held other public appointments, including Indonesian ambassador to Norway and Iceland. He is currently serving as the elected chairman of Dewan Masjid Indonesia (Indonesian Mosque Council), an umbrella organization of local Mosque councils, the president of Az-zahra Islamic University in Jakarta, and the president director of Center for Moderate Moslem (CMM), a non-governmental organization aiming at improving understanding and cooperation among Islamic organizations. He was honored with Gusi Peace Prize from Philippines for his engagement in religious affairs.\n\nTaher was born in Padang, West Sumatra. Upon graduating from one of the top medical schools in Indonesia, Airlangga University, he joined the navy and was assigned to various warships as medical officer. His path changed from medicine toward mental and religious affairs when he was appointed as the head of navy mental up-building agency, overseeing all chaplains in the navy. Shortly after that, he was promoted as head of Armed Forces Mental Up-building Center with the rank of rear admiral, overseeing all mental upbuilding activities in entire Indonesian military. He ended his military career when he was promoted to the post of General Secretary of the Department of Religious Affairs and later was appointed as a minister in the Cabinet.\n\nDuring his time as Minister of Religious Affairs, Taher implemented several initiatives especially related to managing the Indonesian Hajj pilgrimage which dispatches close to 200,000 pilgrims yearly. Those initiatives included the introduction of several computer systems, including SISKOHAT (Integrated Hajj Coordination System), a computer network for handling all activities related to Hajj. Similarly, he was responsible for the introduction of Dana Abadi Umat (DAU), a fund for helping Islamic education, and Dawah in Indonesia. DAU, started in 1996, and was funded through efficiencies in managing the organization of Indonesian pilgrims. From 1996 through 2004, DAU has successfully collected more than $70,000,000 and has spent a huge amount of money in helping Islamic education, dawa, and other Islamic activities in Indonesia. Taher was also active in promoting understanding among different religions in Indonesia to avoid any religion-based conflict in the country and in bridging communication among religions in the world. \n\nAfter leaving the cabinet, Taher was appointed as Indonesian ambassador to Norway and Iceland. He ended his service in Oslo, Norway in 2002. He has also served as the President of Az-zahra Islamic University in Jakarta from 2004 through 2008 and as the elected chairman of Dewan Masjid Indonesia (Indonesian Mosque Council) from 2006 through 2011. He also holds a position of President Director of Center for Moderate Muslim (CMM), an organisation that promotes understanding among various Muslim organisations. He was awarded Doctor honoris causa in Islamic Dawah from Jakarta Islamic State University (UIN) for his involvement in dawa. \n\nTaher was an active writer and has published various books on health and Islamic study. He is also active in campaign against AIDS and drug abuse.\n\nTaher died aged 76 in February 2013\n"}

{"id": "2183934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2183934", "title": "Conditional access", "text": "Conditional access\n\nConditional access (abbreviated CA) or conditional access system (abbreviated CAS) is the protection of content by requiring certain criteria to be met before granting access to the content. The term is commonly used in relation to digital television systems and to software.\n\nConditional Access is a function that lets you manage people’s access to the software in question, such as email, applications, documents and information. It is usually offered as SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) and deployed in organizations to keep company data safe. By setting conditions on the access to this data, the organization has more control over who accesses the data and where and in what way the information is accessed.\n\nPossible conditions could be:\n\n\nWhen setting up Conditional Access, access can be limited to or prevented from the chosen conditions. This way it can be determined that, for example, access is only possible from certain networks or prevented from certain browsers.\n\nCurrent providers of Conditional Access include: \n\n\nConditional Access can be offered with Microsoft Intune. \n\nUnder the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard, conditional access system (CAS) standards are defined in the specification documents for DVB-CA (conditional access), DVB-CSA (the common scrambling algorithm) and DVB-CI (the Common Interface). These standards define a method by which one can obfuscate a digital-television stream, with access provided only to those with valid decryption smart-cards. The DVB specifications for conditional access are available from the standards page on the DVB website.\n\nThis is achieved by a combination of scrambling and encryption. The data stream is scrambled with a 48-bit secret key, called the \"control word\". Knowing the value of the control word at a given moment is of relatively little value, as under normal conditions, content providers will change the control word several times per minute. The control word is generated automatically in such a way that successive values are not usually predictable; the DVB specification recommends using a physical process for that.\n\nIn order for the receiver to unscramble the data stream, it must be permanently informed about the current value of the control word. In practice, it must be informed slightly in advance, so that no viewing interruption occurs. Encryption is used to protect the control word during transmission to the receiver: the control word is encrypted as an \"entitlement control message\" (ECM). The CA subsystem in the receiver will decrypt the control word only when authorised to do so; that authority is sent to the receiver in the form of an \"entitlement management message\" (EMM). The EMMs are specific to each subscriber, as identified by the smart card in his receiver, or to groups of subscribers, and are issued much less frequently than ECMs, usually at monthly intervals. This being apparently not sufficient to prevent unauthorized viewing, TPS has lowered this interval down to about 12 minutes. This can be different for every provider, BSkyB uses a term of 6 weeks. When Nagravision 2 was hacked, Digital+ started sending a new EMM every three days to make unauthorized viewing more cumbersome.\n\nThe contents of ECMs and EMMs are not standardized and as such they depend on the conditional access system being used.\n\nThe control word can be transmitted through different ECMs at once. This allows the use of several conditional access systems at the same time, a DVB feature called \"simulcrypt\", which saves bandwidth and encourages multiplex operators to cooperate. DVB Simulcrypt is widespread in Europe; some channels, like the CNN International Europe from the Hot Bird satellites, can use 7 different CA systems in parallel.\nThe decryption cards are read, and sometimes updated with specific access rights, either through a conditional-access module (CAM), a PC card-format card reader meeting DVB-CI standards, or through a built-in ISO/IEC 7816 card reader, such as that in the Sky Digibox.\n\nSeveral companies provide competing CA systems; ABV, VideoGuard, Irdeto, Nagravision, Conax, Viaccess, Synamedia, Mediaguard (a.k.a. SECA) are among the most commonly used CA systems.\n\nDue to the common usage of CA in DVB systems, many tools to aid in or even directly circumvent encryption exist. CAM emulators and multiple-format CAMs exist which can either read several card formats or even directly decrypt a compromised encryption scheme. Most multiple format CAMs and all CAMs that directly decrypt a signal are based on reverse engineering of the CA systems. A large proportion of the systems currently in use for DVB encryption have been opened to full decryption at some point, including Nagravision, Conax, Viaccess, Mediaguard (v1) as well as the first version of VideoGuard.\n\nIn Canadian and United States cable systems, the standard for conditional access is provided with CableCARDs whose specification was developed by the cable company consortium CableLabs.\n\nCable companies in the US are required by the Federal Communications Commission to support CableCARDs; standards now exist for two way communication (M-card) but satellite television has its own standards. Next generation approaches in the United States eschew such physical cards and employ schemes using downloadable software for conditional access such as DCAS.\n\nThe main appeal of such approaches is that the access control may be upgraded dynamically in response to security breaches without requiring expensive exchanges of physical conditional-access modules. Another appeal is that it may be inexpensively incorporated into non-traditional media display devices such as portable media players.\n\nConditional access systems include:\n\n\n\n"}

Widespread airplay on Osaka's local radio stations and word-of-mouth resulted in both Yaida and Aozora records becoming the focus of a bidding war between the larger record companies for both recording and distribution contracts, the final Japanese distributing rights being sold to Toshiba-EMI with Aozora retaining artist control and independent label status.\n\n\"B'coz I Love You\" was the first single released under contract, entering the Japanese charts at number 16 in July.\nThrough the association with Toshiba-EMI, live appearances in the UK (both London and Manchester) followed in September.

In her long career she has worked with prominent Italian songwriters such as Pino Daniele, Ivano Fossati, Mario Lavezzi, Mango and Enrico Ruggeri, among others. She has experimented with different genres, from rock to reggae, from funk to pop. Her sister Mia Martini was also a prominent singer. Bertè is known for the eccentric clothing she wears onstage for her performances. At one point in her life, she was married to the tennis great Bjorn Borg (1988-1992).\n\nBertè was born in Bagnara Calabra, Province of Reggio Calabria, in Southern Italy.\n\nBertè started as a nude model, and was noticed as a singer in 1974, when she released her album \"Streaking\". She became successful the following year through her \"Normale o Super\" album, as well as \"Sei bellissima\", a ballad that eventually became one of her biggest hits.\n\nIn 1977 the album \"T.I.R.\" updated her sound, and two years later the LP \"BandaBertè\" spawned the hits \"Dedicato\", \"E la luna bussò\", \"Folle città\", and \"Robin Hood\".\n\nBertè next released two albums with a strong funky vibe. The first was \"LoredanaBertè\" (1980) which included the huge hit \"In alto mare\". In 1981 Bertè released \"Made in Italy\", recorded with the American funk group Platinum Hook. The Album included the single \"Movie\", for which a video was directed by Andy Warhol, who Bertè met in New York during the making of the album. The cover photo, signed by Christopher Makos, is a collaborative effort of Bertè with Warhol's Factory; two years later, another shot from that session would be used for the Jazz album cover.\n\nThe following year she left her long-time producer Mario Lavezzi to record with a new producer, Ivano Fossati. With him she recorded what many consider to be her masterpiece album, \"Traslocando\" (1982), containing Bertè's signature song \"Non sono una signora\".\n\nThe following years the albums \"Jazz\" (1983) and \"Savoir faire\" (1984) spawned two hits: \"Il mare d'inverno\", penned by Enrico Ruggeri, and \"Ragazzo mio\", a cover of a Luigi Tenco classic.\n\nBertè released an innovative album in 1985 called \"Carioca\", a tribute to Brazilian singer Djavan which included \"Acqua\" and other hits. Many songs from the album were subsequently covered by The Manhattan Transfer.\n\nBertè became engaged to tennis champion Björn Borg in 1988, and they were married in September 1989.\n\nBertè has had numerous notable performances at the Sanremo Music Festival, also known as the \"Festival della canzone italiana\". Her first appearance was in 1986 with a rock song called \"Re\", for which she wore Versace and dressed like a pregnant woman. In later years the Critics' Award at Sanremo was called the \"Mia Martini\" after Bertè's sister, who won the first Award offered in 1982. To date, Bertè has not won a top award at the festival.\n\nIn 1988, along with her second appearance at the Sanremo festival, she released the \"Io\" album with producer Corrado Rustici, who has also worked with Black Lace.\n\nIn the spring of 1992 Bertè and husband Björn Borg officially split. Their divorce was finalized in 1993. That year, she released a new album, \"Ufficialmente dispersi\". That same year, Mia Martini joined Bertè at Sanremo for a duet. Their song, titled \"Stiamo come stiamo\", was the first single of Bertè's new album. Later that summer, Bertè released a second song from the album. The single, titled \"Mi manchi\", was an Italian radio hit.\n\nBertè again appeared at Sanremo in 1994 when she performed an emotional song called \"Amici non ne ho\". The song was a hit and was included in her first live compilation titled \"Bertex Ingresso Libero\".\n\nHer 1995 performance was the funky song \"Angeli & Angeli\", a single from Bertè's \"Ufficialmente ritrovati\", a greatest hits compilation.\n\nOn Friday, 12 May 1995, her sister Mia Martini committed suicide by overdosing on drugs. The death of her sister caused Bertè to become clinically depressed.\n\nIn mid-1996 she began work on her following album, \"Un pettirosso da combattimento\". Released in 1997, the album is one of Bertè's most personal to date, featuring a new hard rock sound and lyrics based on the tragic loss of her sister. Bertè's seventh appearance at the Sanremo Festival featured a song titled \"Luna\", a desperate cry about her life.\n\nHer second live compilation album was released in 1998 and was recorded with a live orchestra.\n\nIn 2002 she returned to Sanremo for the eighth time with a song called \"Dimmi che mi ami\". That same year she dropped her current record label (one she had joined just a few months before) and began searching for a new label. She eventually signed with NAR.\n\nBertè joined a reality show called \"Musicfarm\" in 2004. With the money she earned from her appearance she began to work on a new album. This became her 2005 effort titled \"BabyBertè\", which was released in September. Her first album in seven years, the CD debuted at #2 in the official album chart. The second single from the album, titled \"Strade di fuoco\", reached #3 in the official single chart. In May 2006 the album was re-released with a bonus CD and a bonus DVD.\n\nIn 2008 she performed at Sanremo with \"Musica e parole\". In 2012 she performed \"Respirare\" there with Gigi D'Alessio, and the same year released the single \"Ma quale musica leggera\".\n\nIn 2019, the song \"Non ti dico no\" receives the double platinum disc certification for the over 100.000 copies sold.\n\nIn 2019 she published on the occasion of the 69th Sanremo Festival, the single \"Cosa ti aspetti da me\" with which she ranked 4th. The song is awarded the public award of the Ariston, created ad hoc following the whistles of the audience in the hall at the announcement of the first three artists classified. During the Festival, Loredana scored a total of 3 Standing ovations winning the appreciation of the Ariston audience.\n\n\n\n"}

Credit card companies included universal default language in their cardholder agreements at that time, due to increasing deregulation of the industry. Today, approximately half of the banks that issue credit cards have universal default language. However, since the inception of these provisions, most credit card companies have not enforced them regularly or systematically.\n\nEvery year since at least 2003, Congress has considered several bills to curb abusive credit card practices, including universal default provisions. In the meantime, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a stern advisory letter to the credit card industry regarding several of the most egregious practices. Most credit card companies have not responded to the letter.\n\nIn 2007, Citibank became the first bank to voluntarily eliminate its universal default provision.\n\nIn 2009, most forms of the practice were outlawed in the United States.\n\nUnder the theory and practice of risk-based pricing, the interest rate of the loan should reflect the risk of the borrower to avoid subsidizing those who default at the expense of those who always pay on time (or alternatively, to allow loans to be given to a broader range of customers, with a broad range of credit history). \n\nUsually, if an interest rate is to be risk-based, the risk premium (or amount charged extra for the risk) is set at the time of an account opening. However, this does not take into consideration that the risk of a borrower defaulting may change later (and in fact the risk might be less). \n\nThus, while lenders have increased credit limits and lowered rates to borrowers in good standing, reflecting the decreased perception of risk, recently lenders have begun to raise rates to those it later has found have defaulted with other lenders.\n\nThis practice generally only happens on credit cards, which are one of the only forms of consumer credit to have an adjustable interest rate not simply based on an interest rate index but on the perceived risk of the customer (both positive and negative). \n\nInstead of a specific increase in the risk premium charge, credit cards often change their interest rate to what is known as \"the default rate\". This rate is usually the highest rate charged by the card, an average of 27.8%. In addition this is charged in a first in, last out FILO basis. \n\nNormally the default rate is charged when a customer fails to make a payment on a particular lender's credit card, but with universal default, the lender will charge the rate if the customer defaults elsewhere.\n\nThe concept of universal default is criticized for many reasons. \n\n\nSupporters of the concept argue that lenders should use all available information at all times in order to avoid adverse selection. These supporters argue that the continuing practice of charging higher prices reflective of risk will allow lenders to charge lower prices reflective of non-risk, or, to extend credit to those previously thought to be too risky in the past, giving benefits to those potential borrowers. These supporters argue that the increased rates reflect the risk and are not price gouging, as proven by the steady or diminishing profit margins of the credit card business. \n\nStill others, while admitting that the increased default rate more than compensates for the risk, argue that competitive pressure makes that so (i.e. because lenders who do charge the default rate can possibly offer lower normal rates, while lenders who do not would seemingly have to try and advertise that the lack of a default rate is a competitive advantage (opening them up to adverse selection), or adopt the practice themselves.\n\nThe Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 prohibited the practice of retroactively raising any annual percentage rate, fees, or finance charges for reasons unrelated to the cardholder's behavior with their account. One of the intentions of this law was to shield customers from arbitrary rate increases if they have been on time with their account. \n\nHowever, this law did not prohibit all forms of universal default. Credit card companies have begun the practice of canceling altogether the accounts of customers who are delinquent or in default with other credit agencies even if the customer is still in good standing with the credit card company.\n\n"}

It was founded as the Academy of Advertising Art by Richard S. Stephens in 1929. It has 283 full-time teachers and 1154 part-time teaching staff, and about 11,000 students; it claims to be the largest privately owned art and design school in the United States.\n\nThe school has open admissions and an admission acceptance rate of 100%. In 2016, its accreditor expressed concern over low graduation rates; approximately 7% of students then completed a four-year degree within the allotted time. As of 2015, the school has not published job placement rates since 2006, and disagrees with the US Department of Education over whether it is required to do so.\n\nThe school is one of the largest property owners in San Francisco, with the main campus located on New Montgomery Street in the South of Market district.\n\nIt was founded in 1929 as a school for advertising art. The founder, Richard S. Stephens, a painter and magazine editor, led it until 1951 when his son Richard A. Stephens took over, who 1992 was replaced by his daughter Elisa Stephens. Under her presidency, student numbers increased from around 2000 to 18,000 by 2012, but have since fallen to under 12,000. The school has been participating in the NY Fashion Week event bi-annually since 2005.\n\nStarting in 2007, the San Francisco city planning commission held more than twenty hearings relating to possible violations of city land-use laws, including the unauthorized conversion of rent-controlled housing to academic use; in May 2016, the city brought a lawsuit against the school. In December 2016, an agreement was reached whereby the Academy agreed to pay the city $20 million in fees, $7 million of which will go to purchasing low-income housing. The school will also provide additional low-income housing for seniors as part of the deal. The University failed to meet the terms of the 2016 agreement and in January 2020 the agreement was amended, requiring the Academy of Art University to pay $37.6 million to the city to build affordable housing.\n\nAs of January 2018, it is fighting a 2009 lawsuit alleging that it defrauded the federal government of student aid through illegal recruitment practices.\n\nThe school offers associate, bachelor's and master's degrees in about twenty-five subjects. Some courses are offered online.\n\nAcademy of Art University received regional accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges in 2007. The school is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. In interior architecture and design, the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree (taught or online) and Master of Fine Arts degree are accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation. The Master of Architecture degree has, since January 1, 2006, been accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board while the Bachelor of Architecture program was granted as of January 1, 2015.\n\nIn 2016, approximately 7% of students completed a four-year degree within the allotted time. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 31% of students complete a four-year degree within 150% of that time (the \"6-year graduation rate\"). For online-only students, the 6-year graduation rate is much lower, at 6%; in mid-2015, about 35% of all students were online-only. For part-time students the 6-year graduation rate is 3%. About 58% of students are female.\n\nThe university owns and operates the Academy of Art University Automobile Museum with 200 vintage cars \n\nThe school sports teams, the Urban Knights, compete as members of the Pacific West Conference in 14 sports in NCAA Division II.\n\nIn the 2014–2015 season, the men's cross country team had a second-place finish and the women's team had a record fourth-place finish, earned at the Pacific West Conference Championships. Valentin Pepiot, their third NCAA Nationals individual qualifier, was one of the top finishers from the PacWest in the postseason finale. Academy of Art earned a record 10 PacWest postseason honors. For the 2015, indoor and outdoor track and field seasons, they had seven All-Americans honors and one NCAA individual champion in Jordan Edwards.\n\n\nPast and present staff of the school include:\n\n"}

Fisher retired from HP Labs in 2006.\n\nFisher is married (1967) to Elizabeth Fisher; they have a son, David Fisher, and a daughter, Dora Fisher. He holds Spanish citizenship due to his Sephardic heritage.\n\nIn his Ph.D. dissertation, Fisher created the Trace Scheduling compiler algorithm and coined the term Instruction-level parallelism to characterize VLIW, superscalar, dataflow and other architecture styles that involve fine-grained parallelism among simple machine-level instructions. Trace scheduling was the first practical algorithm to find large amounts of parallelism between instructions that occupied different basic blocks. This greatly increased the potential speed-up for instruction-level parallel architectures.\n\nBecause of the difficulty of applying trace scheduling to idiosyncratic systems (such as 1970s-era DSPs) that in theory should have been suitable targets for a trace scheduling compiler, Fisher put forward the VLIW architectural style. VLIWs are normal computers, designed to run compiled code and used like ordinary computers, but offering large amounts of instruction-level parallelism scheduled by a trace scheduling or similar compiler. VLIWs are now used extensively, especially in embedded systems. The most popular VLIW cores have sold in quantities of several billion processors.\n\nMultiflow was founded to commercialize trace scheduling and VLIW architectures, then widely thought to be impractical. Multiflow's technical success and the dissemination of its technology and people had a great effect on the future of computer science and the computer industry.\n\n\n\n"}

He ruled under Trujillo during the end of the Third Republic, and later served the Duvalier dynasty in Haiti.\n\nAbbes was born in 1924 in Santo Domingo, the son of a German American accountant and a Dominican woman. As a young man he was interested in sports, and one of his first jobs was as a sports reporter. In the mid-fifties, he moved to Mexico, where he worked as an official in the Dominican embassy. He started to gather information on anti-Trujillo dissidents and relayed this information to the island. Abbes also studied the technical aspects of spying and intelligence gathering. In 1956 he returned to the Dominican Republic and, after Trujillo's half-brother Nene introduced him to the dictator, quickly rose to power.\n\nIn 1958 he became the head of the newly created Servicio de Inteligencia Militar (SIM) and the chief planner of assassinations of the regime's adversaries abroad. SIM employed thousands of people and was involved in immigration, passports, censorship, supervision of aliens, and undercover work, including foreign operations. Thus he was instrumental in the two attempts to kill Venezuela's then-president Rómulo Betancourt; first there was an attack on Betancourt in the streets of Havana to inject him with poison, later a car bomb blew up his Cadillac in Caracas, killing the driver and a bystander, while Betancourt survived.\n\nAfter Trujillo's assassination in May 1961, Abbes moved quickly to hunt down the assassins. Trujillo's son, Ramfis Trujillo, returned from Paris, supposedly with the help of Abbes, and attempted to step into the place of his father, but his attempt ultimately failed, and he left the country, together with most members of the Trujillo family, later that year. Following the Trujillos' departure, President Joaquín Balaguer appointed Abbes consul to Japan, but Abbes soon left the post and spent several years in Europe. He returned to the Caribbean in 1966, moving to Haiti, where he worked for then-President François 'Papa Doc' Duvalier as a security advisor. Abbes disappeared in June 1967. According to journalist Bernard Diedrich, Abbes and his wife had come under suspicion for plotting against Duvalier, but the reasons for his disappearance, and those responsible, remain unknown.\n\nMario Vargas Llosa's historical novels \"The Feast of the Goat\", about Trujillo's Dominican Republican, and \"Fierce Times\", about Arbenz's Guatemala, devote much space to Abbes.\n\n"}

His style of comedy is often political and involves issues of race, culture, criminal justice, and social class. He is best known as the host of the Comedy Central show \"Mind of Mencia\" which produced four seasons before being cancelled in 2008. Around this time, Mencia received several accusations of plagiarism and joke-stealing in his stand-up routines.\n\nMencía was born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the seventeenth of eighteen children. His mother, Magdelena Mencía, was Mexican, and his father, Roberto Holness, was Honduran. At the time of his birth, Mencía's mother was engaged in a domestic dispute with his father, and declined to give her son his biological father's last name. The name appearing on his birth certificate is \"Ned Arnel Mencía,\" although Mencia has said that out of respect for his biological father, he went by the Holness name anyway, and was known as \"Ned Holness\" until he was eighteen years old.\n\nMencia was raised Roman Catholic in East Los Angeles, California, by his aunt Consuelo and uncle Pablo Mencia. By his own admission, staying out of trouble was difficult while growing up, but with the help of his family, he excelled in school and stayed out of gangs. He attended Garfield High School in Los Angeles County. Mencia dealt drugs when he was 19 years old and burglarized a house. He majored in electrical engineering at California State University, Los Angeles, but left early to pursue a career in comedy after a successful performance at an open mic night at The Laugh Factory. He has an older brother named Joseph Mencia who often appeared on \"Mind of Mencia\".\n\nIn 1988, Mitzi Shore, owner of The Comedy Store, suggested that Mencia change his first name from \"Ned\" to \"Carlos\" in order to appeal to the Mexican audiences. Mencia performed at venerated LA stand-up venues such as The Comedy Store and The L.A. Cabaret. His success in these venues led to appearances on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" and \"Buscando Estrellas,\" where he attained the title \"International Comedy Grand Champion.\" Then, in 1994, Mencia was chosen to host HBO's latino comedy showcase \"Loco Slam.\"\n\nMencia followed up \"Loco Slam\" by hosting \"Funny is Funny!\" on Galavision in 1998. He would continue to do stand-up, including a very successful tour in 2001 with Freddy Soto and Pablo Francisco, \"The Three Amigos.\" Mencia also did two half-hour specials on HBO, the second of which won him a CableACE Award for \"Best Stand-Up Comedy Special.\" After the release of his first comedy album by Warner Records, \"Take A Joke America,\" Mencia performed his break-out performance on \"Comedy Central Presents\" in 2002.\n\nBy the time his career began to take off in the early 2000s, Mencia was also working as an actor doing guest appearances in the television shows \"Moesha\" and \"The Shield,\" and starring in the film \"Outta Time\" and the animated show \"The Proud Family.\"\n\nIn 2002, he performed on \"Comedy Central Presents.\" In March 2005, Comedy Central announced Mencia's own half-hour comedy show, \"Mind of Mencia\". The show mixed Mencia's stand up comedy with sketch comedy, much like Dave Chappelle's \"Chappelle's Show\". The show achieved moderate success in its first season and was brought back for a second season in the spring of 2006, becoming Comedy Central's second highest-rated program behind \"South Park\". It was brought back for a third season that summer before being cancelled in 2008. \"Mind of Mencia\" was produced by Nedlos, a portmanteau of Mencia's birth name and the name he took prior to naturalizing in the US.\n\nMencia was sometimes a guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show on XM Satellite Radio and CBS Radio. He took part in the first Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour in 2006.\n\nMencia starred in a Super Bowl XLI commercial for Bud Light. In November 2009, Mencia began appearing in commercials for a weight-loss product called Belly Burner, which he has claimed to have used personally.\n\nMencia went on a 2011 stand-up comedy tour, including dates at the Improv in Schaumburg, Illinois, on June 24 and 25, and ending in Las Vegas at Treasure Island on Friday, September 16, 2011.\n\nMencia was a co-founder of the restaurant chain Maggie Rita's, and a co-owner of several locations. By January 2013, Mencia's restaurants had closed amid poor reviews, though one franchised location continued to license the name.\n\nA 2010 \"Wall Street Journal\" article noted that Mencia, along with Dane Cook and Jay Leno, were three of the most hated popular stand-ups by fellow comedians. In 2006, \"Maxim\" named Mencia one of the worst comedians of all time. Mike Byoff of Gawker said of Mencia, \"Not only does he steal jokes from classic comedians but he's needlessly racist and had no sense of comedic timing whatsoever.\"\n\nIn 2005, comedian Joe Rogan wrote a post on his website publicly accusing Mencia of being a plagiarist, alleging that Mencia stole jokes from a number of comedians. On February 10, 2007, Rogan confronted Mencia on stage at the Comedy Store on Sunset Boulevard and accused him of plagiarism. Rogan posted a video of the altercation, along with audio and video clips from other comedians including George Lopez, Bob Levy, Bobby Lee, and Ari Shaffir, among others. Rogan has also posted audio and video clips of Mencia's interviews and joke routines comparing Mencia's routines to those of other comedians on his blog.\n\nComedian George Lopez also accused Mencia of plagiarizing his material. In an interview on \"The Howard Stern Show\", Lopez accused Mencia of plagiarizing 13 minutes of his material in Mencia's HBO special. He also claimed he had a physical altercation with Mencia over the alleged plagiarism. The only joke that Lopez has publicly specified was stolen and used on Mencia's HBO special was a Taco Bell joke. Comedian Ted Sarnowski countered this claim, stating that the joke he performed on radio in 1988 was later taken and used without permission by Lopez, the radio station's resident comic. Sarnowski claims to have given Mencia permission to use the joke.\n\nMencia has also been accused of stealing a routine from Bill Cosby. In his special, \"No Strings Attached\", Mencia performs a bit about a father who spends years training his son for a career as a football player, only to see the son say \"I love you, Mom!\" at his moment of televised victory. Cosby performed a similar bit in his concert film \"\" and wrote briefly on the subject in his book \"Fatherhood\". Mencia told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that he had never seen the film but regretted the similarities between his and Cosby's jokes.\n\nThe allegation of plagiarism was referenced in the April 8, 2009 episode of \"South Park\", \"Fishsticks,\" in which Mencia takes credit for a joke that Jimmy Valmer writes in the episode. When faced with the prospect of being assaulted, he admits, \"I took credit for it because I'm not actually funny!... I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent!\".\n\nMencia addressed the issue of plagiarism in two hour-long interviews with comic Marc Maron on his podcast, \"WTF with Marc Maron\", in May 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Mencia stated in an interview that he had been in therapy due to accusations of plagiarism.\n\nIn February 2009, Mencia was dropped from the Krewe of Orpheus' celebrity lineup for New Orleans Mardi Gras, citing inappropriate comments he made in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Mencia remarked during his stand up: \"I'm glad Hurricane Katrina happened. It taught us an important lesson: black people can't swim.\"\n\nMencia lives with his wife, Amy, whom he married in 2003, in Los Angeles, California. They have one child, Lucas Pablo Mencia.\n\n\nMencia has also appeared on \"Comic Relief\", and hosted \"Loco Slam\" in 1994, \"Latino Laugh Festival\" in 1997, \"Funny is Funny!\" in 1998, and \"Uncensored Comedy: That's Not Funny\" in 2003.\n\n\n\n"}

The first winner was Jaime Koeppe, but she did not receive a contract like subsequent winners of the contest. Other winners included Christy Hemme, Ashley Massaro, Layla El, and Eve Torres. In addition to the winners of the yearly contest, WWE has hired several contestants as Divas, the name that WWE gave at the time to the female performers. As of 2020, Maryse Ouellet is the last remaining female talent to come from the contest, with her acting largely as a valet for her husband The Miz. There were many failed attempts at bringing back the competition over the years following the cancellation of the 2008 season, and was at one point going to return in 2019 under the new name \"Superstar Search\". But those plans were scrapped.\n\nThe first WWE Diva Search took place in between July 1 and August 24, 2003. However, unlike the later Diva Searches, the first Diva Search winner did not receive a contract. She received a photoshoot for an issue of \"WWE Magazine\". Jaime Koeppe was named the first WWE Diva Search winner. The four that competed that year in the 1st WWE Diva search were Jamie Koeppe, Terri Mitchell, Paige and Marsha. Fans voted online and WWE made the final decision. The competition was held the night before Summerslam at Jillian's in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe 2004 WWE Raw $250,000 Diva Search featured four official theme songs.\nOpen casting calls were held in Los Angeles, NYC, and Chicago in June and July to narrow the field down from thousands to 28 women. The following the 28 finalists where chosen from each of the locations:\n\nIn 2004, WWE decided to make an extension of the Diva Search, which included a one-year contract worth $250,000 and was held on \"Raw\". Over 7,000 females applied to be a part of the contest. The final ten contestants were chosen on a casting special aired on Spike TV on July 15, with guest judges Triple H, Randy Orton, Chris Jericho and Edge.\n\nThey began airing the weekly Raw Diva Search segments on July 19. Despite reported claims by the company that the contest would be handled in a classy manner, the contest involved prospective divas performing suggestive acts on live television, such as \"seducing\" a male wrestler. Fans were allowed to vote for the winners, but the outcome of the voting process was questioned by media outlets. The eventual winner of the competition was Christy Hemme, who went on to pose in \"Playboy\" and competed at WrestleMania 21 for the WWE Women's Championship where she was accompanied to the ring by Lita, but ended up with Trish Stratus retaining the title.\n\nFinalists (winner Hemme, runner-up Carmella DeCesare, Amy Weber, and Joy Giovanni) took part in a segment titled \"Diss the Diva\" on August 30, 2004, which was censored at several points due to foul language and obscenities from the contestants when they were asked to taunt one another verbally. Backstage, the four contestants bickered with and disliked each other, as well. Also, during an earlier segment in the competition, Maria Kanellis gave DeCesare the middle finger.\n\nDespite only one winner being crowned in the competition each year, WWE hired a large number of the contestants from past contests and immediately placed them in on-camera in non-wrestling roles. From the 2004 Diva Search, Michelle McCool, Amy Weber, Candice Michelle, Maria Kanellis, and Joy Giovanni all received contracts after losing the contest. Several of the girls were sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling to train.\n\nThe 2005 WWE Raw Diva Search featured one official theme song.\n\nFor the 2005 WWE Raw Diva Search, the eight finalists began appearing on \"Raw\" on June 27.

Contestant Leyla Milani accidentally exposed herself by falling out of her top while attempting to navigate an obstacle course on the July 4 edition of \"Raw\", leading to a \"disqualification\" in the contest.\n\nAshley Massaro was declared the winner on August 15 and received $250,000. As in 2004, other contestants were hired by WWE, including Kristal Marshall, Trenesha Biggers (eliminated in the Top 25) and Elisabeth Rouffaer.\n\nMassaro died on May 16, 2019 at the age of 39.\n\nThe 2006 WWE Raw Diva Search featured three official theme songs.\n\nThe eight finalists made their first appearance on WWE programming on \"Raw\" on July 10. The Diva Search had an awkward beginning on July 10 with an introductory segment on \"Raw\" featuring new host Mike Mizanin. During the segment, Mizanin appeared to have forgotten his lines and stammered on for several minutes when trying to explain the voting procedures for the contest. When introducing the contestants, Mizanin mispronounced names and looked uncomfortable in his new role as Diva Search emcee. Each week, the contestants appeared on both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\". The final three appeared on a special that aired on August 16, 2006 on the USA Network, where the winner was announced.\n\nLayla El won the 3rd annual Raw Diva Search and was placed on \"SmackDown!\" in late 2006. WWE also hired several of the eliminated Diva contestants including Maryse Ouellet, The Bella Twins, Rebecca DiPietro, Brooke Adams, Amy Zidian, and Milena Roucka.\n\nThe official theme song for the 2007 WWE Diva Search was \"Let it Roll\" by Velvet Revolver from the band's second studio album, Libertad, which was released on July 3, 2007. At the time of release, Velvet Revolver was an American hard rock supergroup that featured vocalist Scott Weiland, guitarists Slash and Dave Kushner, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Matt Sorum. \"Let it Roll\" was only used as the official theme song for the competition and was not used as the official entrance theme song for the winner of the competition. Special thanks to Velvet Revolver\n\nThe first competition was on WWE.com on September 10, which was also when the voting started. The winner was announced on the October 29 edition of \"Raw\". Unlike past Diva Searches, this Search was the first to take place exclusively on WWE.com with most of the pre-taped segments TV. Taryn Terrell, Angela Fong and Lena Yada were called up to the roster despite being eliminated.\n\nThe Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported in February 2013 that WWE held an un-aired diva search in the Los Angeles area. Among the prospects that participated were future WWE performers Eva Marie, Alexa Bliss, Lana, JoJo, Devin Taylor, and Veronica Lane, with the former winning the contest.\n\nDuring WrestleMania 31, WWE announced that new shows will air on the WWE Network, including a returning \"WWE Diva Search\", which was expected to premiere in the fall of 2015. There was no additional information given until July 2016, when WWE surveyed fans about potential new WWE Network shows, including a new season of Diva Search under a new name (\"WWE Superstar Search\") due to the fact that the term \"Diva\" was ultimately phased out that year. In addition, the show would've been hosted by Lita and Trish Stratus.\n\nWWE originally announced on January 25, 2019 that the competition would return as a reality show re-entitled, \"WWE Superstar Search\" in association with Bunim-Murray Productions including casting. But on September 29 that year, Squared Circle Sirens reporter Casey Michael confirmed it was cancelled once again.\n\n"}

This white solid is the principal precursor for the manufacture of beryllium metal. Its structure resembles that of quartz, but BeF is highly soluble in water.\n\nBeryllium fluoride has unique optical properties. In the form of fluoroberyllate glass it has the lowest refractive index for a solid at room temperature of 1.275. It dispersive power is the lowest for a solid at 0.0093, and the non linear coefficient is also the lowest at 2 × 10.\n\nThe structure of solid BeF resembles that of cristobalite. Be centers are four coordinate and tetrahedral and the fluoride centers are two-coordinate. The Be-F bond lengths are about 1.54 Å. Analogous to SiO, BeF can also adopt a number of related structures. An analogy also exists between BeF and AlF: both adopt extended structures at mild temperature.\n\nGaseous beryllium fluoride adopts a linear structure, with a Be-F distance of 143 pm. BeF reaches a vapor pressure of 10 Pa at 686 °C, 100 Pa at 767 °C, 1 kPa at 869 °C, 10 kPa at 999 °C, and 100 kPa at 1172 °C.\n\n'Molecules' of liquid beryllium fluoride have a fluctuating tetrahedral structure. Additionally, the density of liquid BeF decreases near its freezing point, as Be and F ions begin to coordinate more strongly with one another, leading to the expansion of voids between formula units.\n\nThe processing of beryllium ores generates impure Be(OH). This material reacts with ammonium bifluoride to give ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate:\nTetrafluoroberyllate is a robust ion, which allows its purification by precipitation of various impurities as their hydroxides. Heating purified (NH)BeF gives the desired product:\n\nIn general the reactivity of BeF ions with fluoride are quite analogous to the reactions of SiO with oxides.\n\nReduction of BeF at 1300 °C with magnesium in a graphite crucible provides the most practical route to metallic beryllium:\n\nThe chloride is not a useful precursor because of its volatility. \n\nBeryllium fluoride is used in biochemistry, particularly protein crystallography as a mimic of phosphate. Thus, ADP and beryllium fluoride together tend to bind to ATP sites and inhibit protein action, making it possible to crystallise proteins in the bound state.\n\nBeryllium fluoride forms a basic constituent of the preferred fluoride salt mixture used in liquid-fluoride nuclear reactors. Typically beryllium fluoride is mixed with lithium fluoride to form a base solvent (FLiBe), into which fluorides of uranium and thorium are introduced. Beryllium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF/BeF mixtures (FLiBe) have low melting points (360 °C - 459 °C) and the best neutronic properties of fluoride salt combinations appropriate for reactor use. MSRE used two different mixtures in the two cooling circuits.\n\nBeryllium compounds are highly toxic. The increased toxicity of beryllium in the presence of fluoride has been noted as early as 1949. The in mice is about 100 mg/kg by ingestion and 1.8 mg/kg by intravenous injection.\n\n"}

A range of businesses, services and community facilities are located there as well as a high school: Daramalan College.\n\nDickson Centre is located 3 km north of Civic along Northbourne Avenue at the northern end of the suburb of Dickson. It lies on the southern side of Antill Street and is bounded on the eastern side by Cowper Street.\n\nDickson Centre is the largest group centre in Canberra, Australia. It is structured as an outdoor pedestrian area with a ‘village square’ feel, without a mall or arcades. There are a broad range of community facilities, restaurants, shops and offices.\n\nThe central area around Woolley Street is often referred to as Canberra's Chinatown, though, it has diversified to include Indian, Ethiopian, Italian, Japanese and South-East Asian restaurants as well as Chinese restaurants and grocers.\n\nCommunity facilities are primarily at the eastern end, and include: the post office, swimming pool, playing fields, community health clinic, gymnasium, church and an ACT Ambulance Service station, which serves the inner northern suburbs.\n\nThe western side, approaching Northbourne Avenue, has large offices, which include: Telstra’s regional headquarters; TransACT; ACT Motor Registry; CanberraConnect; and the ACT Planning and Land Authority.\n\nOther services include: a large newsagency, a health food shop, Jhay's shoe repairs, optometrist, a number of automotive repairers and small offices such as real estate agents and accountants.

{"id": "2184080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184080", "title": "The Labyrinth of Time", "text": "The Labyrinth of Time\n\nThe Labyrinth of Time is a graphic adventure computer game created by Terra Nova Development, a two-man team composed of Bradley W. Schenck and Michal Todorovic. Intended to be the first in a series of games, \"The Labyrinth of Time\" was less successful than similar graphic adventures released around the same time, such as \"The 7th Guest\" and \"Myst\". It is the sole game produced by Terra Nova Development. In the years after its release, \"The Labyrinth of Time\" was published on more recent platforms by The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. in collaboration with the original developers.\n\nThe story of \"The Labyrinth of Time\" is loosely based on Greek mythology. The game begins during player's commute home from work. While aboard the subway, the player and their train car are suddenly sucked into an alternate dimension. An illusion in the form of the mythological character Daedalus explains that King Minos has forced him to oversee the construction of a labyrinth that spans the space-time continuum. Upon its construction, King Minos will invade and conquer all times and places with his supernatural powers. Daedalus pleads for the player to find a way to destroy the labyrinth before Minos can complete his conquest.\n\nIn-game terminals and journal entries reveal the extent of Minos's power. As explained by the lone archivist on a lunar library, a figure identifying himself as the king appeared simultaneously to all world governments in all time periods, seizing control of their militaries and erasing all written history. Minos's new abilities seem to extend beyond time travel; the scene of the king's tomb strongly implies that he rose from the grave.\n\nThe labyrinth that the player explores spans many time periods and locations. Despite their incongruity, each area is thematically connected by the story of Martin Garret, a professor intrigued with discovering the tomb of the unnamed Sorcerer-King at a far-off ziggurat near Uxmal. Desperado Mad Dog Maddigan, the one man who knew the location of the Sorcerer-King's treasure chamber, was buried in the Western town of Revolver Springs, California, along with a map to the ziggurat's chamber. Revolver Springs, however, was destroyed in a fire on May 1, 1882, leaving the location of his grave a mystery. Garret was about to begin his second expedition to the ziggurat, but suffered from anxiety after losing his lucky shirt in a previous dig.\n\nWhen the player finds the ziggurat, they can retrieve the shirt. They are also able to go back in time to Revolver Springs and pick up a newspaper explaining that the local graves were relocated to make way for a railroad extension project. The player leaves both for Garret to receive, changing history. With the encouragement and new information, Garret locates Mad Dog Maddigan and completes his expedition. Among the treasures brought back from the Sorcerer-King's tomb, Garret discovers a talisman that was reputedly used to destroy buildings.\n\nThe player must operate three levers in the ziggurat to reach the center of the labyrinth and take, among other items, the talisman to destroy its keystone. After dispelling an illusory Minotaur guarding the Maze Center, the player breaks the maze's keystone. This causes the labyrinth to unfurl at the seams. Daedalus appears in person to offer thanks for his freedom, then leaves to ensure King Minos can do no more harm. He leaves the player floating in an area that does not exist in time or space.\n\nThe game ends with a teaser for a sequel, \"The Labyrinth II: Lost in the Land of Dreams\". The sequel was never produced.\n\nOn December 7, 2004, \"The Labyrinth of Time\" was re-released by The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. for the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, AmigaOS, and Linux. The new versions of the game restored some audio quality and added a breadcrumbs feature for navigating mazes, as well as porting the original code to Simple DirectMedia Layer. The Amiga version was released as freeware and can be downloaded from Aminet and its mirrors or as an .iso from the official site.\n\nThe game was later ported to Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch on November 14, 2009. It is at present available for purchase or download on the online game store Steam.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\"s Charles Ardai in December 1993 admitted that expecting \"The Labyrinth of Time\" to not have a maze was unrealistic. He stated, however, that although \"pretend[ing] to be a piece of interactive fiction\", it was \"almost nothing but mazes, linked end to end in a complex, irritating chain\". Ardai criticized the \"relentless stylish visuals\" as \"eye-candy and boring eye-candy at that\", with no way to distinguish between the few objects necessary for gameplay and the many non-interactive ones. He advised Electronic Arts to \"dismantle \"The Labyrinth of Time\" and sell it cut-rate for clip art\". In April 1994 the magazine said that \"Though mythology and time travel interbreed seamlessly, its depressingly empty world and staid adventure game mechanics create a game that is less than timeless\".\n\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"Labyrinth of Time\" the 43rd-worst computer game ever released.\n\nIn January 1994, \"PC Gamer UK\" awarded the game its \"Recommended\" seal, with reviewer Phil South giving it a 91% rating. South defined the game as quick, hot and deep: \"Quick because it takes no time at all to get into [...]. Hot because its state-of-the-art presentation because it makes it both look good and sound like a million bucks [...]. Deep because, once you get over the initial novelty and start to want something to occupy you for a while, the game has enough bite to keep you enthralled for as long as you're prepared to put the effort in, with puzzles and problems to tax experienced and neophyte adventurers alike\".\n\nIn February 1994, \"PC Zone\" also recommended the game, giving it a score of 89 out of 100. Reviewer Paul Presley criticized the game's \"less than user-friendly interface\", stating that there's \"far too many mouse clicks to do far too few things\", while highly praised the visuals and sound, which \"produce an atmosphere unrivalled in an adventure game since \"The 7th Guest\"\".\n\n\"The One\" gave the Amiga version of \"The Labyrinth of Time\" an overall score of 81%, referring to the music as \"nothing short of brilliant\", and praising the graphics, stating that \"\"Labyrinth Of Time's\" obvious selling point is its graphics ... Unfortunately, the adventure itself doesn't quite come across as being as impressive as the graphics.\" \"The One\" expressed that the \"packaging itself gives no indication of the down-beat nature of the game ... [the intro outlining backstory events] come as an unpleasant surprise\" and criticized the mazes, stating that the auto-map negates their purpose, making them \"nothing more than tedious\", and were frustrated by the \"dated\" and \"limiting\" UI.\n\n"}

In his Major League Baseball career, he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Texas Rangers, St. Louis Cardinals, Colorado Rockies, Chicago Whitesox, Kansas City Royals, Washington Nationals, Cincinnati Reds and San Diego Padres.\n\nWells attended Elkins High School in Missouri City, Texas and was a baseball star and an honor roll student. In baseball, he won All-State and All-America honors after his Senior year (1995). He was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 58th round of the 1995 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign with the Brewers. Instead, he went to Baylor University.\n\nHe posted a career record of 21-14 for the Baylor Bears with a 5.17 ERA and 288 strikeouts in three collegiate seasons and was 2nd Team All-America, 1998 Big 12 1st Team, 1998 All-Region, Pre Season All America 2nd Team. He also played with the Brewster Whitecaps in the Cape Cod League during the summer of . He went 5-6 with a 1.92 ERA, 49 strikeouts and five saves to earn the league's Outstanding Pro Prospect Award.\n\nWells was the first round (16th overall) draft pick of the Chicago White Sox in the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. He made his first major league appearance with the White Sox the following year. In his debut against the Detroit Tigers, Wells went 5.1 innings, giving up 6 hits, 2 runs and 1 earned run while walking 2 and striking out 4 for his first Major League victory\n\nAfter the season, in which he split time between the starting rotation and the bullpen, Wells was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nAs of the end of the season, Wells had a 55-69 record and a 4.36 ERA after 188 games over the course of seven seasons. Wells led the league in losses in 2005, going 8-18 on a Pirates team that went 67-95.\n\nOn March 1, , Wells announced he would have surgery to remove a blood clot in his right arm. The surgery was performed on March 6, and he returned to the field on June 19, 2006.\n\nAt the trade deadline in 2006, Wells was traded from the Pittsburgh Pirates to the Texas Rangers for Jesse Chavez.\n\nOn November 28, 2006, Kip Wells signed a free agent contract with the St. Louis Cardinals.

Jeff Francis was supposed to get the start, but the Rockies' first game was rained out, and manager Clint Hurdle opted to start Wells to keep the rotation on normal rest. Wells began the season compiling a 2.29 ERA in ten games with 16 strikeouts as the primary long relief pitcher out of the bullpen. However, on April 30, Wells was placed on the disabled list with blood clots in his pitching hand. On August 10, 2008, the Rockies designated him for assignment and was eventually released.\n\nWells signed with the Kansas City Royals on August 18, 2008.\n\nOn March 11, , Wells signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. He was brought up to the majors to pitch out of the bullpen, but was ineffective, posting a 6.49 ERA in 26.1 innings before being placed on the disabled list with a right adductor strain on June 2. He was again designated for assignment on June 24.\n\nOn July 9, 2009, Wells signed a deal with Cincinnati Reds Triple A affiliate, the Louisville Bats.\n\nIn August Wells was promoted to the Reds once again pitching in major league baseball.

It is one of four high schools within Topeka Public Schools. In the 2010-2011 school year, there were 1,840 students enrolled.\n\nTopeka High School was established in 1871, and moved to its current location in 1931. At the time, it was among the first million dollar high schools west of the Mississippi River. Topeka High offers a variety of sports and extracurricular activities, and notable alumni include Charles Curtis, 31st Vice President of the United States. Topeka High School's mission \"is to prepare all students for college and/or career readiness and success in a global society\".\n\nThe Topeka Board of Education established Topeka High School in 1871, and the first classes were held on the 3rd floor of Lincoln College (now Washburn University) at the time located where the GAR Memorial Hall is today. Over the next 10 years, the school was moved to various locations, including the Washburn Building at 10th and Jackson, and a room situated above the Topeka YMCA and \"Daily Capital\" newspaper. In 1882, the first black student graduated from Topeka High. Attendance continued to outgrow the capacity of the school facilities, and in 1894 a new school was completed on the northwest corner of 8th and Harrison, at a cost of $85,000. Topeka High School's student population had reached 1,000 by 1903, and a decision was made to construct a Manual Training High School across the street on the southwest corner of 8th and Harrison, at a cost of $100,000. One third of the new building would be for manual training, and the remainder used for academic classes.\n\nIn 1915, an auditorium and cafeteria were added to the north school, and the old auditorium was converted to classes. Soon after, a portable frame building was constructed to serve as a study hall and library, and in 1923, an administration building known as 'The Annex' was added to the west side of the south building. In 1921, Topeka High's cafeteria cook Ida M. Moyer was declared \"Champion Pie Baker of the World\". It was calculated that over the previous 6 years, Moyer had baked 37,248 pies.\n\nOvercrowding persisted at the new facility, made worse in 1924 when Topeka's Fire Marshall closed the school's 4th floor, calling it \"the biggest fire trap in the city\". A committee planning the construction of a new high school recommended that one large school be built, and that it occupy an entire city block. They wished it to be \"an addition to the City's public buildings, and not just another building\". Bishop James Wise offered to sell the grounds of Bethany College and other church property for a price of $142,000, and in 1928, Topeka voters approved issuing bonds of $1.1 million (=$14 million in 2014 adjusted for inflation) to finance construction of the new Topeka High School. Thomas Williamson (an alumnus from 1907) and Ted Griest were selected as architects, and Linus Burr Smith as designer. Construction of the new school took 18 months, and the total cost was $1.8 million. The school opened in September 1931, and there were 2000 students enrolled by the following year.\n\nTwo new high schools helped ease the crowded conditions at Topeka High: Highland Park High School was annexed into Topeka in 1958, and Topeka West High School was completed in 1961. Restructuring of the district curriculum meant that in 1980, students in the 9th grade would begin attending high school. In 1984, Topeka High installed a computer-assisted automated dialing device which called home each time a student was truant. Principal Ned Nusbaum commented, \"It's been a very effective tool for getting kids into class\". The US Dept of Education recognized Topeka High as a \"School of Excellence\" in 1989.\n\nIn 2001, Topeka High awarded an honorary diploma to the Honorable Eric S. Rosen, Justice, Kansas Supreme Court—a longtime supporter of the school. The school celebrated its 75th Anniversary at its current site on September 17, 2006. In 2007, Topeka High School was ordered to stop providing free condoms to students, as it was contrary to school district policy. The annual Martin Luther King event, sponsored by the state of Kansas, took place in Hoehner Auditorium in 2012. Topeka High is located near the Statehouse, and the governor's celebration at the new venue was well received.\n\nThe 1931 campus is a stunning, three-story Gothic building of almost 278,000 square feet designed by Thomas W. Williamson, a 1907 graduate of Topeka High School.\nNotable architecture includes an ornate bell tower, which rises 165 feet over the main building entrance and contains an 18-note Deagan tubular tower chime. In 1974, the tower was rededicated in honor of Thomas Williamson.\n\nThe library was modeled after the Great Hall at Hampton Court Palace. Much of the wood shelving is hand-carved, and the ceiling is hand-painted. The original chairs, now 75 years old, remain in the library and have been restored by the Topeka High School Historical Society.\n\nThe 1931 building was fitted with a water supply and drain for a pool, though rising costs and concerns about segregation delayed the pool's construction until 1957. In 2005, the 20-yard swimming pool located underneath the gym was closed and converted into Laney Gym (after former swim coach Chet Laney). It is used for P.E. classes and wrestling. An additional gym was constructed on the soccer field located on the northwest side of the school where JV basketball games, Freshman basketball games, and volleyball games are played. Varsity basketball continues to be played in the \"Dungeon.\"\n\nThe school building contains 4 fireplaces, and a greenhouse built in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 2000, the school installed air conditioning.\n\nTopeka High School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 2005.\n\nIn 1988, Topeka High School was selected as a Blue Ribbon School. The Blue Ribbon Award recognizes public and private schools which perform at high levels or have made significant academic improvements.\n\nTopeka High has eight classes on a traditional bell schedule Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. On Wednesday and Thursday, the schedule changes to a modified block schedule. Odd numbered classes are on Wednesday and even numbered classes are on Thursday. In 2017 it was decided that Trojan time would be every single day during the 4th class period. Before it was only on Thursdays. Trojan Time allows students to sign out to specific locations for further help from teachers, or just stay in their current class and study. Six percent of Topeka High's enrollment comes as transfer students. Students outside the attendance zone come to the school for its strong fine arts program, including a music program (jazz band, drum line, wind ensembles, orchestra, and concert choirs,) its forensic and debate teams, as well as its foreign language program, which offers Spanish, German, Mandarin, and French. Also, THS also supports a Marine Corps JROTC drill team (1999–present). \n\nThe school newspaper, \"The World\", is a member of the High School National Ad Network. The school yearbook is \"The Sunflower\". Both publications are members of JEA and NSPA. Topeka High, under the former direction of Richard Green, has also built up its broadcast journalism program. \"The Newsdesk\" a bi-monthly news broadcast showcasing student news and feature packages. Under the direction of Green, \"The Newsdesk\" has won multiple statewide broadcasting awards. \"The Newsdesk\" is filmed on campus in \"The Tom Browne Memorial News Room\".\n\nTopeka High maintains a strong tradition of debate and forensics throughout its prolific history. The school has qualified nearly 180 competitors to the National Tournament of the National Speech and Debate Association and before 2013, had qualified students every year for 33 straight years. The school has 6 national champions, more than any other school in the Flint Hills. The debate squad has won 4 state championships, finished second 6 times, and third place twice. The forensics squad boasts 12 state championships, with a string of 7 straight championships from 1995-2002. Topeka High forensics has 40+ individual 6A State Speech champions. The Debate and Forensics squad is coached by Dustin Rimmey.\n\nStudents arrive from USD 501 middle schools, including: Robinson, Jardine, Landon, Eisenhower and Chase. Six percent transfer into THS from outside the Topeka Public Schools district, such as other school districts or parochial schools. The senior class of 2011 had 370 students, and more than 80% enrolled in some kind of post secondary education. More than $1.2 million in scholarships were awarded to Topeka High seniors in 2005.\n\nThe National Merit Scholarship Program is a college scholarship competition that includes taking the PSAT/NMSQT. The school has had 19 Semi-finalists, 35 Commended Scholars, 7 National Achievement Scholars, 3 Corporate Sponsor Merit Scholars, and 3 Hispanic Scholars.\n\nTen to fifteen students per year attend THS from countries such as Belgium, Turkmenistan, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Germany, Thailand, Brazil, Switzerland. Students are sponsored by the following exchange programs: AFS, AIFS, ASSE, CHI, AYUSA, ERDT, WISE, ISE, and Share.\n\nRunning of the halls: During first period of days that THS has a home football game, the students gather in the halls of Troy, cheerleaders and the drill team, flag team, and marching band march through the halls to promote school spirit.\n\nThe school offers many extracurricular activities, including performing arts, school publications, and clubs.\n\nThe school teams are known as the \"Trojans\", and are classified as a 6A school, the largest classification in Kansas according to the Kansas State High School Activities Association. Throughout its history, Topeka has won 30 state championships in various sports. Many graduates have gone on to participate in collegiate athletics.\n\nAn important part of the school's men's basketball history was the 1949 separation of the basketball teams between black and white players. White basketball players were on the Trojan team, and black athletes were on the Rambler basketball team. There were two different cheer-leading teams. While classes were integrated, blacks didn't have equal representation on the student council and separate school parties were held for black couples and white couples.\nThe first black Topeka High basketball team, the Cardinals, started in 1929, and the Ramblers started in 1935. In 2009 the school looked back at the historic separation of the teams. Former UNC coach Dean Smith came back with a number of others that were associated with the Ramblers to discuss the team's history. There is no separation of the teams now, and is currently one of the most diverse basketball teams in Topeka. In the 2009–10 basketball season they were shown to be a lot stronger than past seasons after beating cross-town rival, Highland Park High School, the defending state champions for the past three years. The 2009–10 team is coached by Pat Denney.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2184120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184120", "title": "Entropion", "text": "Entropion\n\nEntropion is a medical condition in which the eyelid (usually the lower lid) folds inward. It is very uncomfortable, as the eyelashes continuously rub against the cornea causing irritation. Entropion is usually caused by genetic factors. This is different from when an extra fold of skin on the lower eyelid causes lashes to turn in towards the eye (epiblepharon). In epiblepharons, the eyelid margin itself is in the correct position, but the extra fold of skin causes the lashes to be misdirected. Entropion can also create secondary pain of the eye (leading to self trauma, scarring of the eyelid, or nerve damage). The upper or lower eyelid can be involved, and one or both eyes may be affected. When entropion occurs in both eyes, this is known as \"bilateral entropion.\" Repeated cases of trachoma infection may cause scarring of the inner eyelid, which may cause entropion. In human cases, this condition is most common to people over 60 years of age.\n\nSymptoms of entropion include:\n\nTreatment is a relatively simple surgery in which excess skin of the outer lids is removed or tendons and muscles are shortened with one or two stitches. General anesthesia is sometimes used before local anesthetics are injected into the muscles around the eye. Prognosis is excellent if surgery is performed before the cornea is damaged.\n\nEntropion has been documented in most dog breeds, although there are some breeds (particularly purebreds) that are more commonly affected than others. These include the Akita, Pug, Chow Chow, Shar Pei, St. Bernard, Cocker Spaniel, Boxer, English Springer Spaniel, Welsh Springer Spaniel, Labrador Retriever, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Neapolitan Mastiff, Bull Mastiff, Great Dane, Irish Setter, Shiba Inu, Rottweiler, Poodle and particularly Bloodhound. The condition is usually present by six months of age. If left untreated, the condition can cause such trauma to the eye that it will require removal.\n\nEntropion has also been seen in cat breeds. Typically it is secondary to trauma, or infection leading to chronic eyelid changes. It is also seen secondary to enophthalmos. Congenital cases are also seen with the brachicephalic breeds being over represented.\n\nUpper lid entropion involves the eyelashes rubbing on the eye, but the lower lid usually has no eyelashes, so little or no hair rubs on the eye. Surgical correction is used in more severe cases. A number of techniques for surgical correction exist. The Hotz-Celsus technique involves the removal of strip of skin and orbicularis oculi muscle parallel to the affected portion of the lid and then the skin is sutured. \n\nAlternative techniques such as the Wyman technique focus on tightening the lower eyelid, this technique is not as effective in cases of enophthalmos.\nShar Peis, who often are affected as young as two or three weeks old, respond well to temporary eyelid tacking. The entropion is often corrected after three to four weeks, and the sutures are removed.\n\n\n"}

Having finished one version of his text, Sidney later significantly expanded and revised his work. Scholars today often refer to these two major versions as the \"Old Arcadia\" and the \"New Arcadia\". The \"Arcadia\" is Sidney's most ambitious literary work by far, and as significant in its own way as his sonnets.\n\nSidney's \"Arcadia\" has a history that is unusually complex even for its time.\n\nSidney may have begun an early draft in the late 1570s, when he was in his twenties. His own comments indicate that his purpose was humble; he asserts that he intended only to entertain his sister, Mary Herbert, the Countess of Pembroke. This version is narrated in chronological order, with sets of poems separating the books from each other. It seems likely that Sidney finished this version while staying at Herbert's estate during a temporary eclipse at court in 1580.\n\nIn 1588, Fulke Greville appears to have appealed to Francis Walsingham to prevent an unauthorized publication of parts of the original, as we learn from a letter that also serves as evidence for the circulation of \"Arcadia\" in manuscript form:Sir this day one Ponsonby a bookbinder in Paul's Churchyard, came to me, and told me that there was one in hand to print, Sir Philip Sidney's old \"Arcadia\" asking me if it were done with your honour's con[sent] or any other of his friends/I told him to my knowledge no, then he advised me to give warning of it, either to the Archbishop or Doctor Cosen, who have as he says a copy of it to peruse to that end/Sir I am loath to renew his memory unto you, but yet in this I must presume, for I have sent my Lady your daughter at her request, a correction of that old one done 4 or 5 years since which he left in trust with me whereof there is no more copies, and fitter to be printed than that first which is so common, notwithstanding even that to be amended by a direction set down under his own hand how and why, so as in many respects especially the care of printing it is to be done with more deliberation,\n\nSidney's original version was all but forgotten until 1908, when antiquarian Bertram Dobell discovered that a manuscript of the \"Arcadia\" he had purchased differed from published editions. Dobell subsequently acquired two other manuscripts of the old \"Arcadia\": one from the library of the Earl of Ashburnham and one that had belonged to Sir Thomas Phillipps. This version of the \"Arcadia\" was first published in 1926, in Albert Feuillerat's edition of Sidney's collected works.\n\nThe version of the \"Arcadia\" known to the Renaissance and later periods is substantially longer than the \"Old Arcadia\". In the 1580s, Sidney took the frame of the original story, reorganized it, and added episodes, most significantly the story of the just rebel Amphialus. The additions more than double the original story; however, Sidney had not finished the revision at the time of his death in 1586.\n\nThe \"New Arcadia\" is a romance that combines pastoral elements with a mood derived from the Hellenistic model of Heliodorus. A highly idealized version of the shepherd's life adjoins, on the other hand and not always naturally (in its literary sense), stories of jousts, political treachery, kidnappings, battles, and rapes. As published, the narrative follows the Greek model: stories are nested within each other, and different storylines are intertwined.\n\nAfter Sidney's death, his revised \"Arcadia\" was prepared for the press and published in two differing editions. Fulke Greville, in collaboration with Matthew Gwinne and John Florio, edited and oversaw the publication of the 1590 edition, which ends in mid-scene and mid-sentence.\n\nIn 1593 Mary Herbert herself published an edition in which the original version supplements and concludes the part that Sidney revised. Later additions filled in gaps in the story, most notably the fifth edition of 1621, which included Sir William Alexander's attempt to work over the gap between Sidney's two versions of the story. Other continuations and developments of Sidney's story were published separately.\n\nThe hybrid editions did not efface the difference between the highly artificial, hellenized revised portion and the straightforward conclusion Sidney wrote originally. Nevertheless, it was in this form that Sidney's work entered history and reached a wide readership.\n\nAlthough \"Old Arcadia\" has never been greatly popular, it has entertained a small set of readers for over 400 years with its sensational treatment of sex, politics, violence, soporifics, mobs, and cross-dressing. Narrated in sprawling Renaissance prose, the romance comprises five \"books or acts,\" organized according to the five-part structure of classical dramaturgy: exposition, action, complication, reversal, catastrophe. This hybrid structure—part prose romance and part classical drama—allows Sidney to contain the diverseness of romance within the cohesiveness of the dramatic arc. The work is often called \"tragicomic\" for its combination of a \"serious\" high plot centering on the princes and Duke Basilius's household and a \"comic\" low plot that centers on the steward Dametas's family. The standard modern edition of \"Old Arcadia\", on which this synopsis is based, is edited by Jean Robertson (Clarendon: Oxford, 1973).\n\nIn Book I, the Duke of Arcadia, Basilius, journeys to the oracle at Delphos and receives a bleak prediction: his daughters will be stolen by undesirable suitors, he will be cuckolded by his wife, and his throne will be usurped by a foreign state. Hoping to preempt this fate, Basilius entrusts the Arcadian government to his loyal subject, Philanax, and retires to a pastoral lodge with his wife, Gynecia, their attractive daughters, Pamela and Philoclea, his boorish servant, Dametas, and the latter's repulsive wife and daughter, Miso and Mopsa. In a nearby city, Pyrocles and Musidorus pass the night; they are cousins, princes, and best friends, and are famous throughout Greece for their heroic exploits. Pyrocles, upon seeing a picture of Philoclea at a gallery, is overwhelmed by a passionate desire to see her in person. To that end, Pyrocles disguises himself as Cleophila, an \"[Amazonian lady] going about the world to practice feats of chivalry,\" and heads for Basilius's pastoral lodge, accompanied by the skeptical but loyal Musidorus. Deceived by Cleophila's feminine disguise, Basilius falls in love with her, and invites her to stay with the family. While Musidorus covertly observes this meeting, he is overwhelmed by a passionate love for the elder daughter, Pamela, and decides to disguise himself as a shepherd, Dorus, in order to gain access to her. When everyone congregates in an arbor to hear the shepherds sing, a lion and bear attack the party. Cleophila kills the lion, saving Philoclea; Dorus kills the bear, saving Pamela. Cleophila's manly puissance leads Gynecia to suspect her secret male sex, while Philoclea forms an intense \"sisterly\" affection for Cleophila.\n\nIn Book II, the action rises as the romantic relationships become increasingly complicated, and as Basilius's retirement foments political unrest. Cleophila struggles to woo Philoclea while simultaneously placating the jealous Basilius and Gynecia. Meanwhile, Dorus, who has ingratiated himself to Dametas and entered his household as a shepherd-servant, struggles to woo Pamela, who is always accompanied by Dametas's vain and ugly daughter, Mopsa. To avoid raising suspicions that he loves Pamela, Dorus addresses all of his significant looks, sighing, singing, poetry, etc. to Mopsa, who laps it up and fails to notice the heavy-handed hints that Pamela, not Mopsa, is the object of his passion. In an extremely complicated piece of hoodwinking, Dorus reveals his identity to Pamela, proposes elopement, and is elated by the princess's willingness to flee Arcadia with him. Meanwhile, Cleophila manages to reveal his identity to Philoclea, and they declare their mutual love. Their idyll is interrupted by a mob of drunken Arcadian rabble who are angry at Basilius for neglecting his sovereign obligations. Cleophila, Basilius, Dorus and friendly shepherds slaughter much of the mob before finally subduing it. Book II ends with the establishment of the unusual love \"square\" in which father, mother and daughter are all violently in love with the cross-dressed Pyrocles/Cleophila, and the love triangle comprising Mopsa, Pamela and Dorus. It also begins the political theme, expanded in the fourth and fifth books, concerning the implications of negligent government.\n\nIn Book III, Musidorus tells Pyrocles of his intentions to elope with Pamela. Pyrocles despairs of his own success with Philoclea because he is under the constant surveillance of the jealous and enamored Basilius and Gynecia. Dorus's elopement strategy begins by distracting Pamela's guardians: he tricks Dametas into wasting a day on a bogus treasure hunt; he dispatches Miso by telling her Dametas is cheating on her with a woman in an adjacent village, and he leaves Mopsa up in a tree waiting for a sign from Jove. The coast cleared, Dorus and Pamela head for the nearest seaport. While resting, Dorus is overcome by her beauty and is about to rape her when they are suddenly attacked by another mob. Meanwhile, Gynecia's passion has become desperate and she threatens to expose Cleophila's identity if he does not requite her love. To distract Gynecia, Cleophila pretends to requite her love, which aggravates Basilius and Philoclea. In an ill-fated bed-trick, Cleophila promises a nocturnal assignation to both Gynecia and Basilius in a nearby cave, intending to trick the husband and wife into sleeping with each other (hoping they won't notice that the other is not Cleophila) and to enjoy a night alone with Philoclea. Book III ends with a double \"climax\": the attempted rape of Pamela by Dorus, and the consummated union of Pyrocles and Philoclea.\n\nIn Book IV, Dorus and Cleophila suffer a major reversal of fortune. Dametas, Miso and Mopsa return to the lodge to find Pamela missing, and Dametas, fearing punishment for neglecting his royal ward, begins a frantic search for Pamela. Supposing her to be with her sister, Philoclea, Dametas barges into Philoclea's bed chamber and finds, of course, not Pamela, but \"Cleophila,\" who is naked and in bed with Philoclea, and who is evidently not a woman. Dametas bolts the lovers inside and sounds the alarum. In the cave, Gynecia and Basilius, each thinking the other is Cleophila, have sex, but recognize each other in the morning. Basilius accidentally drinks a potion that Gynecia had intended for Cleophila, and dies. Gynecia becomes hysterical and self-incriminating, and offers herself up to justice as the murderer of her husband and the sovereign. Philanax, Basilius's loyal friend, arrives to investigate the duke's death and Pamela's flight, and becomes a zealous advocate for executing everyone associated with the death of Basilius. Meanwhile, Musidorus and Pamela fall captive to the attacking mob, but not before Musidorus kills and gruesomely maims several of them. Hoping for a reward for finding the fugitives, the mob heads for Basilius, but is intercepted and slaughtered by Philanax and his men, who take the captive Dorus and Pamela, who are now primary suspects in the duke's murder. Thus, Dorus (now \"Palladius\") joins Cleophila (now \"Timopyrus\") in prison. Pamela demands to be recognized as the new sovereign, but Philanax demands an interim period of investigation and burial before the succession is established. Meanwhile, the body politic erupts into a confused and \"dangerous tumult\" about political succession.\n\nBook V brings the action to its catastrophe. Philanax struggles to maintain order in Arcadia, which is dangerously divided: some factions support various political climbers, others clamor for democratic government, and some call for the election of the two princes, whose good looks and military prowess had made them very popular. Philanax needs a leader capable of commanding the allegiance of the Arcadians and of bringing justice to Basilius's murderers. Luckily, the sovereign most renowned for his wise and just government, Euarchus of Thessalia, has traveled to Arcadia to visit his good friend Basilius. Euarchus is also the father of Pyrocles and uncle of Musidorus, but has no idea what they have been up to. Philanax persuades the reluctant Eurarchus to aid Arcadia by assuming authority for the present and becoming the state's \"protector.\" The book concludes with a lengthy trial scene. Gynecia, \"Palladius\" and \"Timopyrus\" are brought forth to stand before Euarchus, who presides as judge, and Philanax, who argues on behalf of the apparently murdered Basilius. Gynecia's trial goes quickly because she, overcome by grief, wants to die as quickly as possible, and gives a false confession of intentionally poisoning her husband and sovereign. Euarchus sentences her to death by being entombed alive with Basilius. \"Timopyrus\" is tried next, and Philanax delivers a vituperative oratory condemning him for cross-dressing, for raping Philoclea, and for conspiring with Gynecia to murder Basilius; \"Timopyrus\" is acquitted of the murder charges, but is sentenced to death for raping Philoclea. \"Palladius\" is likewise condemned to death for attempted theft of the royal daughter, Pamela. As the convicts are escorted to their executions, a friendly compatriot of Musidorus suddenly arrives with important information. He has heard about the trial, guessed the princes' true identities, and feels Euarchus should know that he has condemned his own son and nephew to death (for various reasons, the identities of Euarchus and the princes has been hitherto obscured). At this moment of recognition, or anagnorisis, Euarchus is devastated, but decides that justice trumps kinship, and with a heavy heart confirms their death sentence. Suddenly, groans are heard from Basilius's corpse and, to the surprise and delight of all, Basilius emerges from a deep coma. All are forgiven, the princes marry the princesses, and the book thus ends with a comic reversal, or peripeteia, from justice and death to reconciliation and marriage.\n\nSidney's manuscripts of the \"Old Arcadia\" were not published until the 20th century. The \"New Arcadia\", however, was published in two different editions during the 16th century, and enjoyed great popularity for more than a hundred years afterwards. William Shakespeare borrowed from it for the Gloucester subplot of \"King Lear\"; traces of the work's influence may also be found in \"Hamlet\" and \"The Winter's Tale\". Other dramatizations also occurred: Samuel Daniel's \"The Queen's Arcadia\", John Day's \"The Isle of Gulls\", Beaumont and Fletcher's \"Cupid's Revenge\", the anonymous \"Mucedorus\", a play of the Shakespeare Apocrypha, and, most overtly, in James Shirley's \"The Arcadia\".\n\nSidney's book also inspired a number of partial imitators, such as his niece Lady Mary Wroth's \"Urania\", and continuations, the most famous perhaps being that by Anna Weamys. These works, however, are as close to the \"precious\" style of 17th-century French romance as to the Greek and chivalric models that shape Sidney's work. The \"Arcadia\" also made a small appearance at a crucial moment in history. According to a widely told story, Charles I quoted lines from the book, an excerpt termed \"Pamela's Prayer\", from a prayer of the heroine Pamela, as he mounted the scaffold to be executed. In \"Eikonoklastes\", John Milton complains of the dead king's choice of a profane text for his final prayer; at the same time, he praised the book as among the best of its kind.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, Samuel Richardson named the heroine of his first novel after Sidney's Pamela. Despite this mark of continued respect, however, the rise of the novel was making works like the \"Arcadia\" obsolete. By the beginning of the Romantic era, its grand, artificial, sometimes obstinately unwieldy style (of Sidney's Areopagus school of poetry but sometimes wrongly held to be euphuistic) had made it thoroughly alien to more modern tastes. However, in the 20th century, the Latin American poet Giannina Braschi spins her own rendition of \"Arcadia\" in the trilogy \"Empire of Dreams\", which features the book \"Pastoral; or the Inquisition of Memories\".\n\nWhile the original is still widely read, it was already becoming a text of primary interest to historians and literary specialists.\n\nThe \"Arcadia\" contains the earliest known use of the feminine personal name Pamela. Most scholars believe that Sidney simply invented the name.\n\nIn 2013, the \"Old Arcadia\" was adapted for the stage by The University of East Anglia's Drama Department, and performed alongside Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" as part of \"The Arcadian Project\". Performances ran from the 3–7 December 2013, at the UEA Drama Studio.\n\nIain Pears' novel \"Arcadia\" (2015) pays open homage to Sidney as a source of inspiration for its layered storytelling and multiple narrative paths.\n\nOn July 26, 2018, \"Head Over Heels\", a jukebox musical adapted from \"Arcadia\" featuring songs by The Go-Go's, opened at the Hudson Theatre.\n\n\nOnline texts:\n"}

It is named after Sir James Dickson (1832–1901) who was a Queensland advocate of Australian Federation and one of the founders of the Australian Constitution. There is no specific theme for street names.\n\nBetween March 1924 and November 1926, the original Canberra Aerodrome occupied the southern third of Edward Shumack's soldier settlement block (which continued to be used for sheep grazing) in what was then known as the District of Ainslie (Block 98i). The official aerodrome extended from a NW corner north of Dickson Library near Antill St in Downer to a SE corner near Dutton St and Majura Avenue, taking in the whole western portion of Majura playing fields and the entire central residential portion of Dickson between Cowper St and Dickson wetlands. The actual landing ground covered the whole of Section 72 Dickson and was marked by placements of rocks at four corners, a windsock, and a large central whitewashed marker (60 feet in diameter) visible to pilots from a distance. This was Canberra's original airport, and was used by RAAF and civilian flights.\n\nCanberra's first air crash took place here, at about 10.30am on 11 February 1926, when a RAAF De Havilland DH9 travelling from Richmond air base to survey the Murrumbidgee River stalled after making a sharp turn to land and crashed in the NW corner, within 100m of where the library now stands, bursting into flames. The 26 year old pilot, Philip Mackenzie Pitt, was killed on impact and is buried in an unmarked grave at Queanbeyan's Riverside cemetery, in the Catholic section. Pitt had trained as a cadet at Duntroon, and done his flight training at Point Cook near Melbourne in 1925. The 25 year old aerial photographer/observer in the back seat, William Edward Callander, was pulled from the wreckage by a farm worker, Walter Ernest Johnson, who had been ploughing the adjoining paddock and leapt the fence to offer aid to the victims. Callander died at Acton Hospital later that evening and is buried at St John's Church in Reid, leaving a widow and two small children. The aerodrome was surveyed six months later by the Federal Capital Commission (FCC), but unwillingness by the FCC to grant a long term lease to the Department of Defence stymied investment in a hangar and other facilities, and urgency to prepare for the opening of provisional Parliament House in 1927 resulted in the aerodrome being transferred to the Duntroon property in Majura Valley (at the western edge of the current airport site).\n\nDickson was gazetted on 28 September 1928 and took in the whole of what are now the suburbs of Dickson and Downer. All of the land in Dickson had been earmarked for an Industrial area on the final 1918 Griffin Plan and blueprint. However the decision to transfer the Industrial area to Fyshwick was taken by 1945, and a 25 year lease was granted in 1940 to Dr Bertram Thomas Dickson, Chief of the Plant Industry Division of the CSIR, for Dickson Experiment Station. The station covered 640 acres, comprising the eastern third and northern edge of Dickson, the whole of Downer (which at that time was named Dickson), and a small part of what is now Watson at the station's northern end. Dickson Experiment Station began operating during World War II and initially focused on trialling crops to aid the war effort including opium, rubber and pyrethrum, with assistance from the Women's Land Army. After the war ended, Dickson Experiment Station focused on soils and pasture research, food crops and sheep farming until as late as 1962. By May 1951 the Department of the Interior had determined that the land was required for suburban expansion and begun sketching plans for new road layouts, schools and a district shopping centre. Antill Street and the stormwater drain were built in 1958-59, and the first incursion into the Experiment Station was for a motel on the corner of Northbourne Avenue south of Antill Street (where the Telstra building is now). The Experiment Station's work was transferred to Ginninderra Experiment Station in Belconnen. The first houses in the suburb were built near Braddon in 1958.\n\nThe suburb is bounded by Northbourne Avenue, Antill Street, Phillip Avenue, Majura Avenue, Limestone Avenue and Wakefield Avenue. Dickson contains no hills or significant slopes. The east arm of Sullivans Creek passes through the middle of Dickson draining storm water from east to west.\n\nThe suburb contains the Dickson Centre, a significant commercial centre in Canberra’s Inner North containing the Woolworths Supermarkets outlet with the greatest turnover in Australia. The centre contains an ambulance station, office buildings, many shops and the Dickson Baptist Church.\n\nOutside the Dickson Centre, the suburb contains the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Canberra radio and television studios. Two colleges are located in the suburb, Dickson College, a public senior secondary school, and Daramalan College, a Catholic high school. The Daramalan Junior school was once located in Dickson, which operated between 1986 and 1997. It was a school for boys in years 5 and 6, and was near St. Brigid's Church.\n\nDickson has large playing fields with several ovals, which are used to play many sports including soccer, cricket and rugby, as well as the venue for schools carnivals, and are a popular place on weekends. Organisations calling the playing fields home including the Majura Junior Soccer Club and Corroboree Little Athletics. Near the playing fields is a walking track between rows of pine, oak and gum trees which leads to the Dickson shopping centre. Hawdon Street is where the Canberra Space Dome and Observatory used to be located before being destroyed by fire in 2010. The street is cut in half by the eastern branch of Sullivans Creek, which runs in a concrete drain. On the south side of Sullivans Creek at this point is the Dickson Wetlands, which was completed in December 2011.\n\nThe suburb is characterised by leafy streets, detached single dwelling houses, and double story duplex town houses. The western part of the suburb is beginning to be redeveloped under a policy permitting two and three-storey flats. Redevelopment with eight to ten-storey flats is permitted on properties near Northbourne Avenue and one such block of flats has been built near the ABC studios.\n\nAt the , the population of Dickson was 2,149, including 28 (1.3%) Indigenous persons and 1,392 (66.2%) Australian-born persons. 48.6% of dwellings were separate houses (compared to the Australian average of 72.9%), while 23.1% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses (Australian average: 12.7%) and 27.8% were flats, units or apartments (Australian average: 13.1%). 40.3% of the population were professionals, compared to the Australian average of 22.2%. Notably 20.7% worked in central government administration, compared to the Australian average of 1.2%, although the ACT-wide average is a very similar 18.4%. Dickson is favoured by students and young adults with 18.6% of its population in the 15 to 24-year-old age group (compared to the Australian average of 12.8%). 49.5% of the population had no religion, compared to the ACT average of 36.2% and the Australian average of 29.6%.\n\n66.2% of people living in the suburb of Dickson were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were 4.7% China, 2.9% England, 1.4% Vietnam, 1.2% Bhutan and 1.1% New Zealand.\n\n70.6% of people living in Dickson speak English only. The other top languages spoken are 4.4% Mandarin, 2.1% Vietnamese, 1.3% Italian, 1.2% other Southern Asian languages and 1.1% German.\n\nDickson is located within the federal electorate of Canberra and it is represented by Alicia Payne for the Labor Party. In the ACT Legislative Assembly, Dickson is part of the electorate of Kurrajong, which elects five members on the basis of proportional representation, two Labor, two Liberal and one Greens. Polling place statistics are shown to the right for the \"Dickson\" polling place at Daramalan College in the 2019 federal and 2016 ACT elections.\n\nCalcareous shales from the Canberra Formation dates from the Silurian period. \nThis rock is the limestone of the original title of Canberra \"Limestone Plains\". Quaternary alluvium lies on top of the shale in the flatter parts of Dickson.\n\n"}

It was directed by Lau Kar-Leung and written by Ni Kuang. The film is the second in a loosely connected trilogy, following \"The 36th Chamber Of Shaolin\" (1978) and preceding \"Disciples Of The 36th Chamber\" (1985). In the first and third films in the series, Liu portrays the Shaolin monk San Te, but in \"Return\", he portrays an imposter monk.\n\nThe story opens at a fabric dyeing mill. The quality of the dyes has noticeably worsened, and the factory owner, Wang, and his subordinate chief, Boss Wa, decide to hire some Manchu overseers to improve the work. Wang decides to cut the workers' salary to pay the mercenaries, and when the workers protest they are viciously thrashed.\n\nWhen sitting in a tea house discussing their problems, the workers are joined by Chu Jen-chieh, a good-hearted small-time con man and the foreman's younger brother who is posing as a monk. He offers to help, but since he cannot actually do kung fu, he and the foreman's assistant, Ah Chao, devise a plan to trick the Manchu into reinstating the full salary pay, with Jen-chieh posing as the Shaolin's head abbot of 36th Chamber, San Te.\n\nAt first the scheme works, but Wang quickly works out that this man is an impostor, and has him driven away and his Manchu hirelings retaliate against the workers. Feeling guilty about what has happened, Jen-chieh leaves and heads for the Shaolin temple to learn the real fighting arts. His first attempts to enter by stealth are thwarted by the vigilant monks and his own bumbling, but eventually he manages to sneak his way in, just to run into the real San Te. He, too, realizes that Jen-chieh is not what he claims to be, but he announces that he wants to give him a chance: Jen-chieh is to build a set of scaffolds all around the temple and renovate the entire complex.\n\nSomewhat reluctantly, Jen-chieh goes to work, but he is constantly distracted by the monks practicing martial arts in the 36th Chamber, which he can overlook from his high vantage point. Eventually, he begins to train himself in kung fu by using the conditions of his assignment to improvise training facilities. However, this causes him to lag behind in his work, and it takes him more than a year to finish the gantry. As soon as Jen-chieh announces that he is finished, San Te wants him to dismantle the structure and leave the monastery. Rebelling against this decision, Jen-chieh lands himself inside the chamber, and while trying to evade the abbot chasing him, he inadvertently manages to pass all hazards set in the chamber with ease. San Te finally corners him and forces him to leave, with a strange smile on his lips.\n\nJen-chieh returns to town to find that the conditions of the workers have worsened: Their salary has been cut by nearly half, and any who have protested had been laid off to eke out a meager existence. Elated by his return, some of the ex-workers begin to pester Jen-chieh with their high expectations, which leads to Jen-chieh instinctively and to his own surprise fighting them off with his newly acquired kung fu skills. The next morning, Jen-chieh appears at the dye mill and thrashes the overseers, using bamboo fibers (like the ones he used when building the scaffolds) to tie them up and incapacitate them, introducing his style as \"scaffolding kung fu\".\n\nOnce the overseers are dealt with, Wang and his bodyguards appear at the scene. Jen-chieh lures them out of the city to a mansion under construction, where he uses the building equipment and the tight quarters to his advantage. Finally overpowering Wang, he forces him to pay his workers their full wages again. Wang admits defeat, and Jen-chieh continues his training on the half-finished grounds.\n\n\n"}

Price was named on the starting line-up and as a headgear-wearing second-rower scored the first try of the game which the Bulldogs eventually won 17–4, giving Price his first taste of premiership victory. The experience of finals football so early in his career was a positive for Price as he established a reputation as an effective front rower/prop and second rower with a high work rate.\n\nDuring the 1998 season Price made his debut for Queensland in game one of the 1998 State of Origin series. He would retain his spot for the following two matches of series in which Queensland were victorious two games to one. His performance at representative level was then awarded with the highest honour for an Australian player as he was announced in the 1998 Kangaroos squad. In the same year Steve Price and the Bulldogs made a terrific finals run where, after finishing the season in 9th position, they won four must-win matches to make it all the way through to the 1998 NRL Grand Final against the Brisbane Broncos which they lost 38–12.\n\nWhen Bulldog captain Darren Britt left the club at the end of 2001, coach Steve Folkes opted for Price to captain the side for 2002. He proved to be a great captain and Bulldogs finished the 2002 season with 20 wins, 1 draw and only 3 losses, although they would not play in the finals due to the salary cap breach. 2003 was another strong year for Price as he was awarded Player of the Year by magazine Rugby League Week; he also captained the sides to 18 regular season wins and a semi-final berth which they lost to the Sydney Roosters. In 2004 Price had a stellar performance playing for Queensland and was awarded the Ron McAuliffe Medal for Queensland player of the series.\n\nDuring the transfer period in 2004 it was announced that it would be his last year with the Bulldogs after 10 years of service, as he was signing with the New Zealand Warriors for 2005. Price could not have gone out in better style as the Bulldogs finished second on the ladder, missing out on the minor premiership by points difference. Price's fairytale ending was then shattered when he tore his medial ligament the week before the Grand Final. His side played well without their inspirational captain and went on to win 16–13 to send Price out with another Grand Final success, even though he did not compete in the final game.\n\nWhen Price left the Bulldogs, who had appeared in the finals consistently and performed very well, he went to join the Warriors who had experienced their worst ever season in 2004, finishing 14th of 15 teams and winning only 6 games all year. Price was straight-away appointed captain of the squad and he clearly made some sort of impact as the team remained competitive for all of their matches. In the opening match of the 2005 State of Origin series Price was named man of the match. The Warriors had a good chance to make the finals; however, a four-match losing streak late in the season removed those chances and they finished the 2005 season 11th, a slight improvement from the previous year.\n\nIn 2006 Price again experienced more salary cap drama. The Warriors were found to have committed major breaches of the salary cap due to poor administration decisions. The NRL announced the club would be deducted four competition points and the club would also be assessed a A$430,000 fine. Those four points would cost the team a place in the finals.\n\nEven at the age of 33 and after 13 years playing professional football, the 2007 season proved to be one of his career bests. In Round 14 Steve Price broke his own record of 'metres gained by a forward' playing against the Cronulla Sharks. Price's previous record was 272 metres; he eclipsed this by gaining 306 metres from 33 hit-ups. Seven weeks later in round 21 Price broke his own record again, this time against the Sydney Roosters where he ran for a total of 323 m. The Warriors finished the regular season strongly, sitting at the top end of the ladder on 4th position, although they struggled to perform come finals time and dropped out of the competition in the second week of the finals losing to the North Queensland Cowboys. However, Price's own personal performance throughout the year was duly recognised as he was awarded the Captain of the Year & Prop of the Year titles at the 2007 Dally M Awards. He ran 4,515 metres with the ball in 2007, more than any other forward in history.\n\nIn August 2008, Price was named in the preliminary 46-man Kangaroos squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and in October 2008 he was selected in the final 24-man Australia squad. He did not, however, play in the World Cup Final due to tearing his calf in the final training session before the Final which Australia lost to the Kiwis.\n\nPrice was eligible for England and New Zealand; however, he has stated he will not switch his allegiance from Australia.\n\nIn April 2009, he was named in the preliminary 25-man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009.\n\nOn Sunday 3 May 2009 Price confirmed he would extend his NRL career to a 17th season after signing a one-year contract with the New Zealand Warriors. Already the NRL's oldest player in 2009, Price was 36 at the start of the 2010 season. He was selected for Australia in the one-off test match against New Zealand on 8 May 2009. In State of Origin 3, 2009, Price was involved in a fight with Brett White, in which he was knocked unconscious by a right hook from White, and while unconscious, he was lifted up by the jersey and dropped on his head by Justin Poore.\n\nPrice was replaced as the Warriors club captain for the 2010 season by Simon Mannering, in a move described by the club as building for the future.\n\nOn 6 April 2010, Price announced his retirement from rugby league at the conclusion of the 2010 NRL season.\n\nOn 29 June 2010, Price announced his immediate retirement. This was due to a heel injury that he picked up during the off-season. This injury did not heal correctly and resulted in three operations, meaning that he would be unable to take to the field at all during the 2010 NRL season. This meant that although 2010 would be his final season as a professional rugby league player, he would not play a single game.\n\n\n\nPrice graduated from the Southern Cross University with a Masters in Business Administration in 2010 as the Outstanding Young Alumnus of the Year.\n\nIn the 2011 New Year Honours, Price was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to rugby league. The award citation read: \"He began the role (as captain) following the club's worst-ever season and helped rebuild it to become one of the league’s best.\" \"He played a mentoring role to less experienced players. In 2006 he led the team with honesty and integrity while it was investigated by the National Rugby League over salary cap breaches, and in 2007 he was awarded Captain of the Year and Prop of the Year at the Dally M Awards.\" \"Mr Price has been described as 'the most loved Australian in New Zealand sporting history'.\"\n\nPrice is the father of Giants Netball player Jamie-Lee Price.\n\n"}

It was released by Lorimar Productions and was first telecast on ABC on Wednesday October 10, 1973 during the ABC Movie of the Week. It has since been shown many times in syndication and was distributed on home video and now on DVD. It is known as \"Nightmare\" in certain countries in Europe. \nThe story centers around a young housewife who unknowingly unleashes a trio of hideous goblin-like creatures from within a sealed fireplace in the Victorian mansion, inherited from her late grandmother, that she and her husband are restoring. Now free, the creatures begin terrorizing her and later reveal their sinister plans to her: whoever frees them must become one of them. It has since become a cult film, and a theatrical remake of the same name was released in August 2010.\n\nSally Farnum and her husband Alex inherit an old mansion from Sally's recently deceased grandmother. Shortly after moving in, she discovers a bricked-up fireplace in the basement den. The estate's handyman, Mr. Harris, tells her that Sally's grandmother had him seal it up after her grandfather died and that it is better to leave it the way it is. After he leaves for the day, she uses some of Harris' tools to try to remove the bricks herself. She fails, but is able to pry open a small side door used for removing fireplace ashes. Inside is not a fireplace at all but a large, dark, deep sub-basement. As Sally leaves the den, several whispering voices call her name from behind the fireplace, proclaiming that \"She set us free.\"\n\nSally begins to feel unsettled in the house. One night she is awakened by voices whispering her name, and an ashtray mysteriously falls off her bedside cabinet. Alex dismisses her concerns and believes she is suffering from nervous tension. The next evening, something grabs her dress as she is walking down the stairs and she hears voices whispering \"We want you.\" Freeing herself, she sees something scuttling away behind a curtain, which she believes is a small animal of some kind. Later, she hears the same whispering coming from behind the fireplace in the basement den. Alex remains unconvinced of her story, but makes sure the ash door is bolted securely shut.\n\nThe following night, Sally throws a dinner party for Alex's colleagues at his law firm. During the party, Sally sees a small, hideous goblin-like creature near her leg under the dinner table. She screams, but nobody believes what she saw and the creature quickly vanishes. Alex grows impatient with her and thinks she is becoming delusional. While Sally is in the shower, three of the goblin creatures turn out the lights so that they can attack her with a razor. As Sally turns the light back on, the creatures shriek and retreat from the brightness into the bathroom cupboards where they disappear. She tells Alex they should sell the house.\n\nThe following day, Alex goes away on business and Sally arranges to go and stay with her friend Joan. Before she goes, the creatures attempt to trip Sally down a flight of stairs, but they accidentally cause the death of her interior decorator instead. Sally tries to confront the creatures and asks them what they want, and they reply they want her spirit. Whoever frees them (as Sally did by opening the fireplace) must become one of them. Sally's doctor prescribes sedatives and her friend Joan stays with her. Joan begins to believe Sally's story. Alex remains unconvinced. He leaves to meet their handyman regarding the history of the house and the fireplace. Sally tries to stay awake but the creatures put sedatives into her coffee and cut the electricity. They lock Joan outside when she checks the circuit breaker. Sally manages to walk downstairs, but the creatures trip her in the dark. While she is semi-conscious, they drag her into the basement den and into the unsealed fireplace.\n\nSally, now one of the creatures, patiently waits for their next victim to move into the house.\n\n\n\"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\" was released on VHS through USA Home Video in the 1980s. It was released on DVD on August 18, 2009, by Warner Archive burn-on-demand service. This release went out of print the following year, but was remastered and re-released again on August 24, 2011. This newly restored release of the film was timed to release with the theatrical release of the remake two days later. In 2019 it was given a 4K remaster and released on Blu-ray by Warner Archive.\n\nCritical response for \"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\" has been mostly positive upon its initial release.\n\nMaitland McDonagh from TV Guide rated the film three out of a possible five stars, calling the film \"[an] above-average, made-for-TV chiller\" also writing, \"Overall the film may be a little slow and obvious by today's standards, but these stand-out moments insure it a place in the memories of children of the '70s\". Donald Guarisco from AllMovie gave the film a positive review, calling the film \"a potent little fright-fest\", complimenting the film's script, acting, characterizations, steadily built tension, and Newland's tense direction. Ian Jane from DVD Talk wrote, \"While \"Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark\" may not be a deep film nor will it win any awards for originality, it's a fun seventies horror picture with some memorable moments, great camerawork and a genuinely surprising finale.\"\n\nThe film was not without its detractors, with some contemporary reviews of the film noting that the film had become dated.\nOn his website \"Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings\", Dave Sindelar gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the film's familiar storyline, Demarest's cliched character, and overuse of the whispering voices of the creatures. However, Sindelar called it \"one of the better made-for-TV horror movies out there\" and stated that the film did have its moments.\n\n\"Bloody Disgusting\" felt that the film had become dated, and criticized what it called Darby's overacting, creature design, and forced perspective shots of the creatures. The review did, however, commend the film for its \"campy surrealism\" which they felt was the film's strongest attribute.\n\nDirector Guillermo del Toro (who produced and co-wrote the film's remake) was heavily influenced by it when he saw it on television as a child. He and his brothers would reportedly follow each other around the house saying \"Sally, Sally\", mimicking the creatures in the 1973 film. \"It was something close to my heart for a very long time ... We thought the movie was the most terrifying on Earth\", said del Toro.\n\n\"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\" has often been noted for its Freudian themes as well as the proto-feminist undertones and the \"fears and anxieties about the changing roles of women and the ways they are so often victimized or go unheard.\"\n\nThe \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" creature known as the meenlock (first appearing in \"Fiend Folio\" (1981)) bears close resemblance to the creatures in the movie.\n\nMiramax Films produced a remake of the film as a theatrical feature, released on August 26, 2011. The remake stars, Bailee Madison, Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce, and was produced and co-written by Guillermo del Toro. The remake marks the directorial debut of comic book artist-writer Troy Nixey.\n\n\n"}

Diablo is an enemy of the Fantastic Four. He is depicted as an evil alchemist. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in \"Fantastic Four\" vol. 1 #30 (September 1964).\n\nDiablo was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and first appeared in \"Fantastic Four\" vol. 1 #30 (September 1964). \n\nIn a 2013 interview with Chris Hardwick of Nerdist, creator Lee said that Diablo was his greatest regret because he cannot remember the character, who he is, and why he did what he did, saying, \"When you create a character you should feel you know him\".\n\nEsteban Corazón de Ablo was a powerful alchemist in 9th century Saragossa, who sold his soul to the demon Mephisto to lengthen his life far beyond a human span.\n\nYears later, Diablo set up a base in Transylvania where he made a pact with the Vampires.\n\nThe villagers had enough of him where they formed an angry mob and buried him within a stone crypt under his castle. Another century later, the Fantastic Four appeared in Transylvania on a vacation, when a local named Baron Hugo told them the legend of Diablo. That night, Diablo whispered to The Thing to awake and free him from his prison by pulling out the stone plug on his crypt and smashing the stone slab that covered him. Freed, Diablo offered a potion to the Thing that would turn him halfway into a human. In exchange for Ben's services for a year, he would give him the other potion that would finalize the change. When the rest of the Fantastic Four arrived, they found Ben working for Diablo. They fought with him and tried to convince him to leave his service, but Ben refused, and the three were forced to leave him behind. Diablo soon made his appearance known to the world, and sold his alchemic chemicals internationally, making him the richest man on the planet. Shortly before the rest of the world, Mister Fantastic discovered that Diablo's chemicals worked, but only for a short while, before failing. The world turned on Diablo, but he had already built up an army of loyal followers and was prepared to use his alchemic powers to conquer the planet. But once Diablo had revealed his true intentions, the Fantastic Four were free to attack him. At the same time, the Thing had also discovered that the potion he was given wore off, and he turned on Diablo, but Diablo used one of his chemical pellets to knock him out and seal him in an unbreakable, glass capsule. The remaining three members of the Fantastic Four soon attacked Diablo's fortress, but after a struggle, Diablo managed to capture them with his chemical pellets. Diablo sealed up the last of the Fantastic Four in the same capsules, but Ben quickly escaped when his broke down. Angered, he chased Diablo through his own castle, until he crushed a suit of armor into a giant ball, and threw it after him. Diablo ran from it, hiding within the crypt that the villagers had sealed him in. The Thing followed behind him and reinserted the giant, stone plug, and then smashed it with both fists, causing the entire castle to come crumbling down upon the crypt. The Fantastic Four were later freed, and the Human Torch melted the stone into slag to harden Diablo's prison.\n\nBut Diablo eventually used his potions to destroy his melted stone prison, and escape to get revenge on the Fantastic Four. His next move was to travel to North America and New York's State University, where he helped Professor Gilbert to animate his android creation, Dragon Man. He turned the Dragon Man against the Fantastic Four, but it eventually turned on him and drove both of them underneath a frozen lake, where he was lost for a time. Diablo later reactivated the Dragon Man, creating a whole army of Dragon Men. He was defeated by the Avengers, however.\n\nDiablo later clashed with Doctor Doom. He next took the Inhuman, Crystal, captive. He took control of Terra Verde, but was ultimately defeated by the Human Torch. Diablo later recruited Darkoth as a pawn to battle Doctor Doom, but was betrayed by Darkoth. Diablo later sent elementals to battle the Fantastic Four, and battled Iron Man after that.\n\nIt was later revealed that Diablo had a romantic relationship with the woman who became the criminal Gilded Lily. Diablo was freed from prison by Gilded Lily, though he turned against her and was defeated by Alpha Flight. Diablo later attacked the Fantastic Four, again using elementals against them. Diablo conquered the country of Tierra del Maiz, and in another clash with Alpha Flight, he was apparently killed.\n\nHowever, Diablo survived and reappeared again later. He was later responsible for the destruction of the Fantastic Four's headquarters, Pier 4. He aided the Fantastic Four in driving the chaos demon Shuma-Gorath back to its home dimension.\n\nDiablo has also fought Spider-Man. After escaping Spider-Man, he is approached by Ana Kravinoff who states that her mother would like to speak with him.\n\nSome time later, he has become a subject of the new Night Thrasher's interest.\n\nHe was later seen in Vieques, an island–municipality of Puerto Rico, where he helped Spider-Man and the Human Torch defeat a giant radioactive sea monster that was devouring the residents and tourists.\n\nDuring \"The Gauntlet\" storyline, Diablo is present with Electro, Ana Kravinoff, Sasha Kravinoff, and Alyosha Kravinoff when Mattie Franklin is sacrificed as part of a ritual that resurrects Vladimir Kravinoff as a humanoid lion creature.\n\nDuring the \"Origin of the Species\" storyline, Diablo is invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team where he promises them that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him. Ever since Lily Hollister's baby was stolen by the Chameleon, Spider-Man had been going on a rampage against any villains involved. The police recovered a web ball containing Spot, Diablo, and Overdrive.\n\nDiablo is later recruited by Max Fury to join the Shadow Council's incarnation of the Masters of Evil.\n\nSometime later, Diablo kidnaps Maria Hill in order to acquire the security code clearances to all active helicarriers and the Triskelion but is defeated by a reformed Doctor Doom.\n\nDiablo is later shown using a cloning spell on a Moloid to excavate a mystical artifact when he is ambushed by the Inhuman known as Mosaic, who destroys the artifact and forces him to surrender.\n\nDiablo is a practitioner of alchemy, science based upon the transmutation of elements, and has attained mastery of the alchemical sciences with his genius-level intellect. He was educated by tutors in 9th-century Spain, and is self-taught in alchemy and modern sciences.\n\nDiablo has extended his youth and life through a longevity serum, and can affect his own body by changing his appearance to look like a different person, or become \"nerveless protoplasm\", which makes him immune to certain forms of harm.\n\nHe employs a huge arsenal of alchemical potions that he discovered or invented, and conceals within hidden pouches and pockets in his costume. His alchemy can transmute elements through means unknown to modern science. Although the range of his power is wide, the effects are temporary unless Diablo provides a second dose, with the exception being the elixir he used on Dragon Man. His mixtures include nerve gas pellets, sleeping potions, a potion that renders a person inert by lowering their body temperature, pellets that make people susceptible to Diablo's hypnotic orders, and other potions and pellets that enable him to transmute inorganic matter (stones to feathers, water to ice, etc.), unleash explosive blasts, model surface features, give life to inanimate objects, and create beings formed from the elements of earth, fire, wind, and water called \"elementals\". He also has alchemical potions which grant him teleportation for quick escapes.\n\nIn the \"Age of Apocalypse\" reality, Diablo and the Absorbing Man work as prison wardens for one of the many prisons maintained for Apocalypse. This particular one is located in a section of Aztec ruins in Mexico. He is killed by Nightcrawler during X-Men's mission to rescue Robert Kelly, a mutant-human peace activist.\n\nIn the \"Marvel Zombies\" reality, Diablo appears as one of the many zombiefied super-powered beings hoping for access to the Kingpin's human cloning vats. He successfully trades several cans of cat food for his desired time. He then made friends with zombie Scorpion. Zombie Diablo then kills himself by ripping out the skull and severely crushed it after one of his arms are ripped apart.\n\nThe Ultimate Universe version of Diablo is named Menendez Flores instead of Esteban Corazón de Ablo. He made his Ultimate Universe debut in \"Ultimate Fantastic Four\" #39. In that issue, it was revealed that he was an evil alchemist who had been confined by the good alchemist Andrea Vecchiato to a \"tower with no door\" in 15th century Milan. Along with the help of his hunchback henchman Peppone, he reached across time to kidnap people close to the Fantastic Four, only to challenge them to a contest. He intended to use Reed's sister as an important part of his plan for immortality. The Four, along with a contingent of soldiers led by Willie Lumpkin, head back in time to oppose him. He was defeated and vanishes after being touched by Reed's temporarily super-powered sister Enid.\n\n\n\n"}
