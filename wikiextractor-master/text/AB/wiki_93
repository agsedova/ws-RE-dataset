{"id": "2034487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034487", "title": "Vajirananavarorasa", "text": "Vajirananavarorasa\n\nVajirananavarorasa (also spelled \"Wachirayan, Watchirayanawarorot\", correct Pali spelling: Vajirañāṇavarorasa, , full title \"Somdet Phramahasamanachao Kromphraya Vajirananavarorasa\" สมเด็จพระมหาสมณเจ้ากรมพระยาวชิรญาณวโรรส ) (12 April 1860, Bangkok, Thailand - 2 August 1921, Bangkok, Thailand) was the tenth Supreme Patriarch of Thailand from 1910 to 1921. He helped to institutionalize Thai Buddhism.\n\nDestined to become \"the leading intellectual of his generation in Siam\", in the words of the Thai historian David K. Wyatt (cited in Reynolds 1979:xiii), his royal name was Prince Manuṣyanāgamānob (พระองค์เจ้ามนุษยนาคมานพ) ('he who is a \"nāga\" among men'). \"Vajirañāṇavarorasa\" is the name he received on a gold nameplate together with the \"Krommamuen\" rank on 16 March 1882.\n\nVajirañana was the 47th child of King Mongkut. He was born in the Grand Palace as the fourth child of Phae, one of King Mongkut's concubines. She died after giving birth to her fifth child, a daughter, when he was one year old. He was then fostered by a maternal relative, Princess Varaseṭhasutā or \"Putrī\", a daughter of King Rama III, and her mother, a royal concubine named Samaśakti or \"Ueng\".\n\nIn the palace, he was taught the Siamese alphabet by a woman, Nok Panakngan. The nobleman Phraya Pariyatidharrmadhātā or \"Piam\" (then called Luang Rājābhirama), deputy head of the Royal Pundits Department, came to the Palace to teach the young Vajirañana and other princes the Khmer script used to inscribe religious texts in Pāli. With a teacher who was official at the Outer Court, Vajirañana studied \"Padamālā\" (Pāli grammar), the Dhammapada commentary, and other texts until 1868. When his elder brother, Prince Brahmavarānurakṣa, ordained as a novice, Vajirañana was allowed to live with him in Wat Pavaraniveśa for some while. There he occasionally studied Pāli scripture with Phra Pariyatidharrmadhātā (\"Chang\", then Luang Śrīvaravohāra), one of the four section chiefs in the Royal Pundits Department, who taught monks and novices at the monastery.\n\nAfter his father had died in 1868 and his elder half brother Chulalongkorn had come to the throne, Vajirañana was back at the palace, receiving more education from his foster aunt, Princess Varaseṭhasutā. With her he practised reading and writing Siamese, and he was taught verse forms, Siamese arithmetic, and astrology.\n\nKing Chulalongkorn founded an English medium school on the palace grounds and hired the Englishman Francis George Patterson for providing Western education. When the school first opened in 1872, Vajirañana began to study there. Patterson instructed the brothers of the king in the morning and the boys from the Royal Pages' Bodyguard Regiment in the afternoon. Patterson could not speak Siamese, and he used European textbooks, teaching English and French (reading, writing and speaking), mathematics and also some European history and geography. Vajirañana and Prince Damrong Rajanubhab were the most diligent of Patterson's students. Vajirañana continued his education with Patterson until 1875.\n\nAt the age of 13, Vajirañana was ordained as a novice for 78 days on 7 August 1873, with Prince Pavareś (สมเด็จพระมหาสมณเจ้า กรมพระยาปวเรศวริยาลงกรณ์, \"Prince Roek\" ฤกษ์, 1809–1892) as his preceptor. As a novice, he lived in Wat Pavaraniveśa, in a small residence known as \"The Printshop\": His father, King Mongkut, had once lived there as a monk and had printed his Ariyaka script there.\n\nAfter having disrobed from his novicehood, Vajirañana got his first bigger amount of money to spend and discovered the world of consume. But in 1876, he met the young (between 25 and 30) Scottish physician Dr. Peter Gowan. Dr. Gowan taught him English here and then and a little about medicine, and he had a big influence on Vajirañana's life conduct (stop smoking, drinking and some prodigal or even dissolute habits). Getting more and more attracted to the monastery, Vajirañana went to visit his uncle, the reigning Supreme Patriarch Prince Pavareś. By him, Vajirañana was given instruction in poetry, astrology, and Buddhist scripture in 1876. He learned some additional astrology (i.e. how to do calendars) from two other teachers, Khun Debyākaraṇa (\"That\") and \"Pia\" (Phrakrupalat Suvaḍhanasutaguṇa at Wat Rājapratiṣṭha). Under the guidance of Prince Pavareś, Vajirañana also took up the study of Dhamma. He also invited one of his former Pāli teachers, Phra Pariyatidharrmadhātā (\"Chang\"), to come to the monastery to instruct him in Pāli again.\n\nVajirañana has always been very critical about the methods by which students learned Pāli and would later rewrite the texts for Pāli studies.\n\nAlthough Vajirañana frequented the monastery, he could not yet decide himself to become a monk. From 12 July 1877, he also worked as a legal secretary for King Chulalongkorn for two years. King Chulalongkorn needed a reliable person such as Vajirañana in the Sangha, and he tried to persuade him to remain a monk even after his ordination according to custom. Though still unsure, Vajirañana promised that if he were to leave the monkhood, he would do so at the end of the first Rains. If he lasted beyond that, he would not disrobe. King Chulalongkorn then promised him to confer on him a princely rank and title if he remained in the monkhood for three Rains – a promise he fulfilled in 1882.\n\nOn 27 June 1879, Vajirañana was fully ordained in the Royal Chapel with Prince Pavareś (aged 71) as his preceptor. Another senior monk, Phra Candragocaraguṇa (Candrarańsī), Abbot of Wat Makuṭakṣatriya, assisted in the ceremony as \"kammavācācariya\".\n\nAfter the ordination rite, Vajirañana spent the first Rains in Wat Pavaraniveśa, studying Pāli (e.g. with the Dhammapada commentary) and Buddhist scripture. One of his former Pāli teachers, Phra Pariyatidharrmadhātā (\"Chang\") taught him again.\n\nAfter the Rains, in November 1879, Vajirañana moved to Wat Makuṭakṣatriya (then called Wat Nāmabaññati). There he studied Pali (the \"Mańgalatthadīpanī\") under Chaokhun Phra Brahmamunī (Kittisāra).\n\nOn 3 January 1880, Vajirañana was reordained in the orthodox Dhammayuttika manner on a raft, with Chaokhun Dharrmatrailoka (Ṭhānacāra) being his preceptor. He continued to live in Wat Makuṭakṣatriya as a pupil and personal attendant of Phra Candragocaraguṇa, and as a Pāli student of Phra Brahmamunī.\n\nOn 25 December 1881, Vajirañana began his Pāli exam, the Supreme Patriarch being his examiner. He advanced to \"prayōk\" 5 at a stroke and was succeedingly raised to \"krom\" rank as promised before. He was also appointed Deputy Patriarch of the Thammayut Sect (\"Chaokhana Rōng Khana Thammayuttikā\").\n\nIn 1892, Prince Pavareś died. Vajirañana became his successor as Abbot of Wat Pavaraniveśa and as Patriarch of the Dhammayuttika order, while Sa Pussadevo became the new Supreme Patriarch.\n\nOn 1 October 1893, the Mahāmakuṭa Royal Academy (Mahamakut Buddhist University) was opened. Vajirañana now could carry out his reforms concerning the study of Pali and the Dhamma. Vajirañana wrote a Pāli grammar and several textbooks. He also designed the university's curriculum. It consisted of secular subjects such as reading and writing Siamese, history, and some science beside religious studies and the preparation for the Pali exam, as the new academy also served the purpose of training monks to become teachers. In 1898, King Chulalongkorn ordered Prince Damrong and Vajirañana to find a possible solution for providing the whole country with a primary education. Due to the lack of money the solution was to let the educated monks be the teachers of the villages in the outer provinces. (This plan, however, was not further pursued after 1902.)\n\nIn 1894, Vajirañana established \"Dhammacakṣu\" ('Eye of Dhamma'), the first Buddhist journal in Siam. It contained news on the academy, articles on Buddhism, and the texts of sermons.\n\nWhile the Mahāmakuṭa Royal Academy belonged to the Dhammayuttika order, King Chulalongkorn also strengthened the school of the Mahānikāya order in the Wat Mahādhātu which in 1896 became the Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University. The Sangha unity was also strengthened by the decision to hold the Pali examination in two sets: one at Mahamakuta Academy, where Vajirañana's new curriculum and a written examination format would be used, and one at the Royal Chapel, where the traditional oral translations would be heard.\n\nThe First Sangha Act of 1902 established a new administration of the Sangha in the country.\n\nIn 1906, King Chulalongkorn raised Vajirañana's princely rank to \"Krommaluang\", although it was not royal custom to promote prince-monks until they reached advanced age. But Vajirañana should not be at a disadvantage in comparison with his brothers.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1910, the position of Supreme Patriarch of Thailand remained vacant. Reynolds speculates that King Chulalongkorn didn't want to appoint a successor to the 9th Patriarch because a senior monk might have been too conservative to support the ongoing reforms, and Vajirañana might have been still too young to be able to assert his reforms against the will of the conservative senior monks.\n\nAfter the accession of King Vajiravudh in 1910, Vajirañana was appointed Supreme Patriarch. In 1921, King Vajiravudh created the honorary title \"Phramahasamanachao\" for the Supreme Patriarch. Vajirañana continued his work in religious education, Sangha administration and scholarship. He breathed new life to the Council of Elders (\"Thera\"), founded by the Sangha Act of 1902. The Publication of \"Thalaeng kan khanasong\" [Announcement of Sangha Affairs] which spread rules for the whole Sangha within the country. In 1912, he created a new curriculum for Dhamma studies that does not require previous Pali studies.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1917, Vajirañana travelled to the provinces of Siam to examine the situation of the Sangha. He later died of tuberculosis in Bangkok on 2 August 1921.\n\n"}
{"id": "2034498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034498", "title": "MS Jutlandia", "text": "MS Jutlandia\n\nMS \"Jutlandia\" (lat.: Jutland) was contracted by and built for the East Asiatic Company (EAC) in 1934, as a combined passenger and cargo ship at EAC's Nakskov Shipyard, Denmark. Following an extended operational life in which she also served as a hospital ship and a royal yacht, she was finally decommissioned in 1965.\n\n\"Jutlandia\" was contracted by EAC in 1934, to replace older ships on the then regular service between Copenhagen and Bangkok. She operated on this route from November 1934, until January 1940, and again from 1954 to the end of 1964.\n\"Jutlandia\" was the only ship in the EAC fleet to be designed with a Maierform bow. She is the second of so far three ships of the same name.\n\nPassengers were accommodated in nine single and twenty-nine double staterooms with all double staterooms provided with a private bath. The dining room could seat seventy with smoking room, ladies lounge, bar and foredeck swimming pool also provided for passenger use. A dining and play room were provided for children. Passenger spaces were ventilated by chilled or heated air. Cargo holds provided capacity.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in September 1939, the ship had just arrived at Rotterdam en route for Copenhagen. As Denmark was not yet part to the war, she completed this and one further voyage to Bangkok, finally returning to Copenhagen in January 1940.\n\nFollowing her arrival in Copenhagen, \"Jutlandia\" was placed at the disposal of the Danish Government. She was sent to Argentina to collect a consignment of grain, returning to Copenhagen on 31 March 1940. On 1 April, she was sent to Nakskov Shipyard for routine overhaul. \"Jutlandia\" was in dry-dock when Germany attacked and occupied Denmark on 9 April 1940. Due to a shortage of diesel oil, Germany did not seize the \"Jutlandia\". Instead, she was laid up at the Slotø island in a small inlet close to the shipyard, together with two other motorships from the EAC fleet, the MS \"Java\" and MS \"Falstria\", manned only by a skeleton crew for maintenance.\n\nHere she remained until the end of the War, despite an allied air raid on 3 May 1945. During the attack the \"Java\" was sunk, while \"Falstria\" suffered some flooding and a fire. \"Jutlandia\" got off with some bullet holes and a minor fire in a cargo hold.\n\nThe \"Jutlandia\" was fully seaworthy again by 11 August 1945 and re-entered commercial service between Europe and the East Coast of the United States.\n\nWhen North Korean communist forces attacked South Korea on 25 June 1950, Denmark agreed to provide assistance to the United Nations Command and to give humanitarian support to the allied forces in South Korea. The decision was not uncomplicated: the mood between the superpowers was extremely tense, and Denmark had to find a way to support the UN without being aggressive. Almost instantly, medical supplies were made available, and after negotiations Denmark also agreed to send a hospital ship. In the fall of 1950, EAC again agreed to place the ship at the disposal of the Danish Government, whilst she was en route to New York City.\n\nThe Danish Government undertook the refitting of \"Jutlandia\" as a modern hospital ship, again at Nakskov Shipyard, and consigned her to Korea. She had four operation theatres, four hospital departments with up to 356 beds, X-ray, eye, and dental clinics, as well as laboratories, dispensary, and special departments.\n\nThe jobs on board were well sought after. At the time 42 nurses were needed. Between 3,000 and 4,000 nurses applied and about 200 were selected for interviews. Doctors and nurses were allocated four to a cabin.\n\nThe bulk of the hospital staff were mature and stable people. This selection was made especially in view of the badly injured patients that could be expected on board. This was not something that young people should see. The average age was around forty.\n\nThe civilian status of \"Jutlandia\" was greatly emphasized. As all other hospital ships, she was painted white with red crosses on the side, but opposed to the 1½ meter high green stripe painted along the side of the military hospital ships, \"Jutlandia\" had a red stripe. \nDanish Red Cross was manning, organizing and running the hospital. EAC supplied the ship's crew. The state paid.\n\n\"Jutlandia\" had Captain Kai Hammerich as senior officer. He quit his job as president for the Danish Red Cross to be able to go on the mission to Korea. He kept his rank as naval officer (in Denmark his rank, \"Kommandør\" is only one step below a rear admiral), in order to improve his ability to liaise with the military leaders of the U.N. forces. He was also the contact person to the Red Cross and the Danish State.\n\nConsultant, senior doctor Mogens Winge was second in command and hospital chief. Captain Christen Kondrup, \"Jutlandia\"'s skipper through many years, stayed on board as the ship's master. In case of a maritime crisis, the command over the ship would automatically transfer to Kondrup, according to maritime law.\n\nAs the hospital crew had to handle soldiers, everybody had military rank in spite of the fact that they were civilians. During the stay in Korea, visiting Allied officers were amused about how \"civilian\" everything was on board.\n\nOn 23 January 1951, she was sent to Korea. She sailed under three flags: Dannebrog (the Danish national flag), the Red Cross, and the UN flag. The day before the departure, she was visited by King Frederik and Queen Ingrid. The King knew Hammerich quite well. While he still was a crown prince Hammerich was his senior officer in the navy. The crown prince had behaved in a careless way during an exercise and literally got a slap in the face from Hammerich as punishment.\n\nAt the departure speeches were made and a small service held, and the foreign minister, a brass band and about 10,000 freezing citizens were on the quay to see the ship off. Hammerich wanted public support. He didn't want \"Jutlandia\" to 'sneak off like a thief in the night'. She sailed with a crew of 97, and a hospital staff of 91.\n\n\"Jutlandia\" was bound for Japan, where she should report for duty at the UN staff. The travel was quite uneventful. There was, of course, the obligatory seasickness in the Biscaya, and the hospital was needed for two patients: the ship's tailor was operated for appendicitis, and senior doctor Tage Kjær fell and burst his achilles tendon. He got a leg cast, stayed on board and did his duty on crutches.\n\nDuring the transfer, the staff had to participate in some very basic military training (stand in line and salute), so they could present a nice front on arrival. For some, this was quite a nuisance - for others, a source of much joyful entertainment. \"Jutlandia\" made the journey in 38 days.\n\nAt the arrival, General MacArthur was quite outspoken:\n\"... There is war out here, a hard war, not like some Danish newspapers write: a Police raid ... I expect endurance, determination, discipline and initiative ...\"\n\"Jutlandia\" started her service in Pusan on 10 March 1951, about 200 km from the frontline. Depending on the intensity of the war, there were from less than 100 to over 200 wounded on board. At quiet times, there was a kind of competition with the American hospital ships to 'capture' patients.\n\n\"Jutlandia\"'s hospital had a high and internationally respected standard. As a result of this, she got some of the most difficult cases. It soon turned out that there were about ten times more surgical than medical patients. The difference was due to the modern vaccines. During e.g. World War I, the ratio was about one to one. Nobody worried much about departmental borders; with a bit of flexibility the patients were distributed where there was room.\n\nAmong the soldiers, \"Jutlandia\" was popular. The ship had room – there was only about half the number of beds as on a military hospital ship of the same size – and advanced special clinics. The 'civilian treatment' together with ship's cook quickly learning to produce cheeseburgers and ice-cream in multiple servings for patients also helped in spreading the popularity of the ship.\n\nA number of soldiers had little notes in their pockets, or tied to their dogtags, noting that if they got wounded, they wished to get transferred to \"Jutlandia\".\n\nThe Korean people's memory of \"Jutlandia\" is heavily influenced by the fact that her hospital was the first that also treated civilian Korean citizens as well as soldiers.\n\nMost of the time, there were vacant beds. It did not suit the crew and staff that the beds were unused when they observed the hardship and misery among the civilian population. The female nurses were not allowed ashore, but the doctors and male nurses sometimes helped on improvised first-aid stations. Without official orders, the local population received limited aid, and in certain cases, patients were brought on board. A number of orphans were also sent on board for medical care. A small children's department was created in an unused corner of the officer's ward. The American captain McKeon had started a small children's hospital, \"Happy Mountains\", on the outskirts of Pusan, with assistance from the ship's doctors. The doctors' aid went so far that medicine 'disappeared' from \"Jutlandia\"'s storage - later to be 'refound' at the children's hospital. General MacArthur certainly got the initiative he had craved.\n\nUrged by the doctors, Hammerich kept pushing the U.N. for permission to treat civilians. The permission arrived in July 1951, under the condition that civilians were sent ashore if wounded soldiers arrived. It did happen that civilians, despite the need for further treatment, were sent ashore. The crew and hospital staff felt miserable about it.\n\nAs the summer heat approached, \"Jutlandia\" was in a bad fettle without air conditioning, which led to the decision to send her to Europe as transport for sick and injured. She departed towards Rotterdam in August 1951. The tour had its problems - amongst other things, some of the patients wanted to leave the ship during harbour stays. As this wasn't possible, it became the centre of some unrest, but in the end all the patients were brought home.\n\nAfter resupplying in Rotterdam, \"Jutlandia\" went to sea again. She arrived on 13 November at Pusan. A large part of the personnel had been replaced - some doctors got so short notice, that they couldn't get on board the ship, but were flown to Korea.\n\nOn the first tour there had been a lot of neurosurgical patients, on the second it was more lung and jaw surgery that took the weight. 100 beds were at the disposal for the Korean military hospitals, and 100 more could be used for civilian Koreans. In the beginning, the UN soldiers felt some discomfort about the Koreans, but the mood changed quickly. The children quickly became as popular with the soldiers as with the crew and staff, and could be found everywhere on the ship.\n\nEven though \"Jutlandia\" had room for up to 350 patients, a reasonable load would be about 250, if the staff was not to be put under strain. On average, the load on this tour would be between 200 and 250 patients.\n\nKorean doctors came on board, and were systematically educated to improve the standard. It was now 'legal' to do humanitarian work Danish style - to help where hardship was found, instead of waiting passively – the local humanitarian work ashore was continued, and school education started in the children's department. The local people were interested in Denmark, a cooperation with e.g. local priests and teachers was started: in the end a Danish – Korean friendship association was founded. The association still exists.\n\nIt gave certain cultural problems to have civilian patients. At that time in Korea it was the rule that the hospital dealt with the treatment of the patient, whereas the supply of the patient was his own problem. So, when a patient was brought on board, the entire family, including all cooking utensils, moved into the foot end of the bed. In some cases the family could be deeply aggravated, if they were not allowed to look after their sick – the hospital staff wasn't completely trusted. Some patients tried to avoid having their bed made: it showed, that they had hidden some of their food away under the pillow. It wasn't a normal occurrence to have food every day, so it was better to ration what was there in time...\n\nAfter the initial problems, things improved. The strange habits of the foreigners became known and accepted, and the local patients were happy to get on board.\n\n\"Jutlandia\"'s people became so engaged in the humanitarian work, that they often rejected their leave in Japan. Quite voluntarily, people took a double turn. The need of the often very sick Korean patients came first.\n\nMuch to the dismay of the Red Cross, no wounded P.O.W.'s were allowed on board. There was deep dissatisfaction that the Red Cross were only allowed to help one side in the conflict: it was felt that the impartiality of the Red Cross was in doubt. But the military leaders of the U.N. would not allow this. To overcome the problem, some of the doctors used their spare time to aid at operations in the hospitals that treated P.O.W.'s.\n\nOn 29 March 1952 Jutlandia sailed, bound for Japan. Another ambulance transport, but this time she was going all the way home to Denmark. She departed on 21 April with 194 patients on board.\nIt was a great help, that there were no psychiatric patients on board this time. Still, there was some quarreling between the patients. The problem was solved by putting the two biggest hotheads in each their own padded isolation cell. That did the trick.\n\nBefore the third tour, \"Jutlandia\" got a helicopter deck, an eye clinic and some British ambulance motorboats during her August/September 1952 refit stay at Nakskov Skibsværft. An airconditioning system was ordered, this was installed in multiple stages, but first after the arrival in Japan. She departed Copenhagen on 20 September 1952, and reached Yokohama on 2 November. The helicopter deck was then inspected and approved.\n\nOn this tour, she was stationed in the Inchon bay, only about 40 km from the frontline. She arrived on 20 November. This close to the front, the crew could sometimes observe the cannon fire, and so be prepared for the arrival of wounded. Thanks to the helicopter deck, occasionally wounded soldiers would be on board and under treatment 20 minutes after they got wounded.\n\nNow the patients came directly from the front. Depending on the activity, this could some times give 24-hour business on board.\n\nIn March 1953, things were especially hot. In only 3½ days, 169 wounded arrived, of these 81 were bad cases. In the whole of March 301 patients arrived - 104 by helicopter, the rest by boat. This was a bit on the rough side for the medical staff. It was under consideration to get some reinforcements from home, but luckily things calmed down again.\n\nThe placement at anchor in the bay, as well as the larger amount of wounded soldiers, reduced the amount of help that could be given to the civilians. Nevertheless, the crew found time to assist building a clinic ashore, that could provide help to the poor and sick.\n\nAs the war ground more and more to a halt, there was less for \"Jutlandia\" to do. It was suggested that she – as a civilian, neutral ship – should be the place where a truce could be negotiated, but the North Koreans rejected the idea. The truce was negotiated elsewhere, and went into effect on 27 July 1953.\n\nHammerich made trouble in Tokyo again. \"Jutlandia\" was sent out to do humanitarian work – \"any\" kind of humanitarian work – not to be in an idle standby position. There was no need for her anymore for military purposes, so she got sent home as an ambulance again. She departed for Yokosuka on 16 August to transfer her last patients, then she was made ready in a Yokohama shipyard for the trip home. She departed from Tokyo on 29 August with 229 patients and released P.O.W.'s on board\n\nThis third transport was easier than the two previous. Only 30 patients needed medical treatment. And the P.O.W.'s felt that just getting on board \"Jutlandia\" was equal to freedom, so they had no problems adapting to the ship's discipline.\n\nShe arrived to a hero's welcome in Copenhagen on 16 October 1953. After 999 days UN service, she was under the Danish flag again.\n\nAll in all, during her service in Korea \"Jutlandia\"'s hospital cared for 4,981 wounded allied soldiers from 24 different nations, as well as over 6,000 civilian Koreans (the number is uncertain: the correct number may be anything up to three times as many), of these an unknown number of children. Only 29 patients died. The most prominent civilian patient was the first President of the Republic of Korea, Syngman Rhee. He was treated by the ship's dental clinic.\n\nFollowing a refit at the Nakskov Shipyard, the \"Jutlandia\" resumed her normal duty between Copenhagen and Bangkok for the first time since 1939.\n\nJutlandia received the Korean Presidential Unit Citation.\nCrew members and medical staff were officially decorated by Denmark with the Erindringsmedaljen for deltagelse i hospitalsskibet \"Jutlandia\"s ekspedition til Korea 1951–1953 (Commemorative Medal for Participation in the Hospitalship \"Jutlandia\"s Expedition to Korea 1951–1953. (479 medals were awarded).\n\nIn September 1960, \"Jutlandia\" became a Royal Yacht when EAC placed it at the disposal of the king of Thailand and his suite during the official visit to Scandinavia by Their Majesties King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit. From Copenhagen, the Royal couple sailed in \"Jutlandia\" to Oslo, the capital of Norway, and Stockholm, the capital of Sweden.\n\nFollowing the visit, the ship returned to normal duty.\n\nThree years later \"Jutlandia\" was selected to sail Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Margrethe (from 1972, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark) on her official visit to the Far East, via Genoa, Heraklion, the Suez Canal, Aden, Karachi, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong. On her return to Denmark, the ship resumed her commercial operations between Copenhagen and Bangkok.\n\n\"Jutlandia\" completed her final voyage between Bangkok and Copenhagen on 19 December 1964, was unloaded and left EAC's roster. On 14 January 1965, she left Copenhagen on her last ever cruise to Bilbao, where she was scrapped.\n\nFor reasons unknown, \"Jutlandia\" was slowly forgotten, until the song \"Jutlandia\" by Kim Larsen, a major hit in Denmark in 1986, brought her to public attention again. The song praises the role of \"Jutlandia\" in the Korean War.\nOn 15 June 1990, on Langelinie, the promenade quay in Copenhagen, a memorial stone for \"Jutlandia\" was revealed. The stone is a block of Korean granite, sailed from Pusan to Copenhagen on the \"new\" Jutlandia, now an . containership.\n\nThe text - in Danish and Korean - is as follows:\n\"23 January 1951 - 16 October 1953.\nDenmark's contribution to the United Nations during the Korean War.\nThis stone from Korea is given in gratitude by the Korean veterans.\"\n\n\"Jutlandia\" is now a part of the Danish history, and a part of the Danish self-awareness. In a dark and gloomy age, she stands out as a symbol for \"doing the right thing\": bringing peace, aid and comfort to an area ravaged by war.\n\nDanish rock musician Kim Larsen wrote a tribute song about Jutlandias contributions as a hospital ship during the Korean war. The song titled \"Jutlandia\" became a large hit in Denmark in 1986.\nThe Jutlandia was featured in the 2018 Danish 6-part TV drama series 'Sygeplejeskolen' (The New Nurses) which depicted the innovative integration of male nurses into a Danish hospital training program. A senior female nurse is accepted to serve on the Jutlandia in Korea.\n\n"}
{"id": "2034507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034507", "title": "Clonegal", "text": "Clonegal\n\nClonegal, officially Clonegall ( ; ), is a village in the southeast of County Carlow, Ireland.

It is just over a mile north of where the River Slaney and the River Derry meet. Clonegal has a much smaller \"twin\" village across the River Derry in County Wexford, Watch House Village.\n\nThe town is served by a primary school, and is the center of an agricultural hinterland.\n\nThe name Clonegal comes from the Irish \"Cluain na nGall\" or \"Meadow of the Foreigner\". This could have originated from when Cromwell’s soldiers, during the Irish Confederate Wars, fought the Irish in the village in 1650 after which all Irish surviving males were massacred. Others contend that it came from foreign students who came to study in a monastery near the village.

Meant to be a “living museum\", Pioneer Village is intended to make the history of Utah come alive. It was founded in 1938 near Salt Lake City by Horace and Ethel Sorensen. In April 1975, Lagoon bought the collection from the Sons of Utah Pioneers, and it opened at the amusement park in 1976.\n\nPioneer Village is dedicated to the pioneers of the 19th century who pushed their way westward in the spirit of religious freedom. Their day began with the earliest sun and did not end until sundown when all tasks were complete. It was said that they could handle a gun or plow with equal dexterity. Pioneer Village contains the mementos of these pioneers and reminds us of a time long ago. There are over two dozen buildings in Pioneer Village.\n\nThe Mormon furniture exhibit contains furniture on loan from the Historical Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Most of the furniture pieces are made of pine, since hardwoods were scarce in the time of the pioneers. However, special coats of paint were used to give the pine furniture the appearance of oak, cherry, mahogany, birds eye, maple, walnut, and other hard woods. Most of the furniture was based on patterns from the East such as Empire, Federal, and Gothic Revival. However, Utah furniture was generally simpler and heavier than the styles it imitated. Some of the pieces in the exhibit include:\n\nThe presses in the Pioneer Village Print shop are from Intermountain Stamp, Patterson’s Print, Ogden Standard Examiner, and the Salt Lake Stamp Company. Since communication was limited in those days, newspapers were a popular commodity and were printed in many communities throughout the state.\n\nThis building contains the repair tools and leather working machines of Charles T. Baxter, a cobbler in American Fork, Utah around the start of the 20th century. Up until 1900, the primary mode of transportation in the Western states was walking. For a nation of walkers, the cobbler was vital.\n\nThis structure was built in 1885 and was the official Coop store of Rockport in Summit County, Utah. It was organized by farmers from the Wanship area and functioned all the way up until the 1930s. This store has a false front, which was typical of the period.\n\nThis china shop contains pieces made from 1830 to 1910. Many of the pieces were carried across the plains by pioneers who knew that there would only be enough room in their covered wagons for a few of their most precious possessions.\n\nThe Hardware Museum is the home of the Sovereign Jewel. The Sovereign Jewel is a stove that is an excellent example of how early Americans would create works of art out of ordinary household items. The bronze dome of the Sovereign Jewel is covered in gems and its doors are illuminated mica. The drapery is carved from nickel. Many years of research have gone into studying the history of the Sovereign Jewel, and as far as it can be determined, it is unique. It originally sold for $36.00, but its replacement value today would be $12,500.\n\nThe Post office was built in Charleston, Wasatch County, Utah in 1905 and operated until 1955. Today it contains the original postmaster's desk and dozens of postal boxes, each with their own combination lock. Like most rural towns in Utah, Charleston did not have mail delivery until recently, so residents would have to come to the post office to pick up their letters.\n\nThe bakery in Pioneer Village sells many baked goods and is the home of the first soda fountain in Utah. The soda fountain came across the plains by wagon which was no easy feat, since the fountain consists primarily of a large marble slab. It was housed in the store of William S. Godbe, which was built in 1855. Customers at the store could choose between strawberry, raspberry, sarsaparilla, and cream soda. In those days, a glass of soda cost 10 cents.\n\nThe David E. Sperry Model Train Museum contains dozens of model trains, most of which are from the collection of David E. Sperry. Sperry’s fascination with trains began in 1928 when he saw an electric train in a friend’s sandbox. From 1930 to 1934 he went through many catalogs and store displays in an effort to increase his collection. In 1935 he was hired by ZCMI as a model train salesman. Over the next sixteen years, he helped customers build their own train layouts both in the store and in their homes. He later joined the local and national train collectors clubs where he received the title, \"The Repairman’s Repair Man.\"\n\nThe train museum is also home to \"The Lagoon Miniature Railroad.\" Built in 1925 in Ogden, Utah, the engine was powered by coal and steam. Originally the train ran two routes: one around the northeast of the Carousel and then north of the White Roller Coaster, and one through the midway and the picnic boweries. For many years the train was on display next to the Lagoon Lake and in 1974 it was rebuilt and ran again until 1986 when it was finally retired.\n\nJust outside the museum is the Union Pacific Semaphore. Built in 1920 in Swissvale, Pennsylvania, this style B lower quadrant semaphore was originally located in Nephi, Utah along the Union Pacific Railroad line. It was used to signal trains to either slow down and pick up orders, or proceed to the next signal. It is said that the design of traffic stoplights were adopted from this type of device.\n\nThis blacksmith shop was built in 1858 and was used to meet the needs of Johnston’s Army stationed at Camp Floyd. The original tools are still on display in the building.\n\nMost people are aware of the covered wagons used by early pioneers who settled the territory. But not everyone is aware of the wide variety of horse-drawn vehicles used in those times. This museum contains some of the major styles of carriages used in that era. Some of them include the following:\n\nThe Pioneer Village Barber Shop contains a large collection of shaving mugs and other barber shop equipment from the 1890s. In addition to offering a shave and a hair cut, the barber shop also provided bathing facilities. Because of this, it contains a tin tub and a pot-bellied stove where water was heated.\n\nThe Pioneer Village Gun Exhibit Building is modeled after the Fort Douglas Ordnance Building built in 1860. The weapons displayed in the building range from guns used in medieval times to weapons used today. Many of the guns on display were used in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, and several were used by gunfighters in the Old West.\n\nThe Gun Exhibit Building also contains a safe that belonged to Porter Rockwell.\n\nThe Bigler Cabin was built by Jacob G. Bigler, a Pioneer Weaver who was an early settler in the Nephi area. Mr. Bigler lived and worked in this house, and wove cloth that he traded with other settlers.\n\nThe Pioneer Village Gingerbread house was built by Alma Gibbons in 1904. Alma Gibbons cut the trees, hauled them to his saw mill, and then built this home with his own hands. Supposedly the building is haunted (much like the rest of the village) and anyone in it alone at six in the evening is invited to dinner.\n\nThe Little Rock Chapel was constructed in 1863 and originally served as a fort. It then became a courthouse with a jail attached. After that it became a schoolhouse, and in 1869 it was designated by Brigham Young as an LDS church. Today the building contains the original pews, pot-bellied stove and lectern.\n\nThis log cabin was built by Erastus Bingham in North Ogden in 1853. Bingham was a farmer and a father of ten children. Two of those children discovered the Bingham Copper mines, which were named after them.\n\nThe Rockport School House was constructed in 1870 out of \"squared-off\" pine logs. In the winter, the school children they would have to huddle around the pot-bellied stoves to keep warm since it was impossible to adequately heat the entire cabin. The building also served as an LDS chapel until a few years later when the LDS settlers could afford to construct a church.\n\nThe Wanship cabin was the first two-story home built in Summit County. It contains a great deal of pioneer era furniture including a pine rocking chair, a high post bed, and a Mormon Couch.\n\nThe following rides and attractions no longer exist in Pioneer Village:\n\n\n\n"}

GIK has eight academic faculties which strongly emphasize on science and engineering. Its campus is located in the vicinity of Swabi district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan and is home to awe inspiring landscapes.\nFounded by civil servant and former President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1993, since its establishment, the institute has consistently attracted the country's most influential scientists such as Abdul Qadeer Khan, Asghar Qadir, and Shaukat Hameed Khan, who played a formulating role in elevating the institute as one of world's finest science and engineering college.\nIt is a competitive institution with a low acceptance rate requiring students to show extraordinary academic capabilities with strong financial footing to be accommodated. GIK is one of the top institutions ranked by the HEC.\n\nThe GIK Institute is a private educational institution, named after former bureaucrat and former President of Pakistan Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The project was delegated to Pakistani scientist, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, who was one of the founding members of the institute and was once registered as an associate professor of physics. The genesis of the Institute can be traced back to the early 1950s when Mr. Ghulam Ishaq Khan (late) became acutely aware of Pakistan's dependence on foreign expertise and imported technology. Out of his frequent interaction with the foreign and local experts emerged the idea that a center of excellence in engineering sciences and production technology ought to be established in the country, a center whose standards of education are comparable to those of its counterparts in the advanced countries.The transformation of this idea into a practical proposition took place in December 1985 when the Benevolent Community Care and Infaq Foundation donated Rs. 50 million for setting up an institute in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for promotion of science and technology.\n\nA milestone in the evolution of the Institute was the registration in June, 1988 of its parent body, namely, Society for the Promotion of Engineering Sciences and Technology in Pakistan (SOPREST). Mr. Ghulam Ishaq Khan (late), then the President of the country, was elected the President of the Society for life and Mr. H. U. Beg was appointed its Honorary Executive Director and Mr. Samiullah Marwat the first full-time Secretary.\n\nThe task of conceiving and formulating the basic form and features of the Institute was entrusted to a group of eminent scientists and engineers. These professionals started transformation of the dream into reality at a galloping pace. The civil works at the campus site were started in early 1990. An interim office of the Institute was set up in August 1992 where senior professionals with outstanding backgrounds worked in a cohesive group to evolve the educational aims and philosophy of the Institute, its curricula and details of state-of-the-art equipment for its laboratories and workshops.\nIn March 1993 an \"Ordinance\" was promulgated by the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Provincial) Government for the establishment of the Institute under the umbrella of SOPREST, and the first batch of students was inducted the same year in October. Since an Ordinance has a limited life, it was ratified through an \"Act\" by the Provincial Assembly in July 1994.\n\nThe Institute symbolizes the immense altruism and concern for collective welfare that exists in the private sector. It is the first privately funded institute of its kind in the country and dedicated to bringing our engineering education at par with the advanced countries. The tuition fee has to be in consonance with the high cost of education. However, what the students are charged hardly covers the annual expenditure. Total capital outlay of the Institute to-date on historical cost basis works out to more than Rs. 2.5 billion for which funds were mobilized from diverse sources including a major donation of Rs. 750 million from Infaq Foundation and land measuring 216 acres donated by the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nMajor founding donors include Nouman Benevolent Community Care, Infaq Foundation, Chiniot Anjuman-e-Islamia, Dawood Group of Industries, and the Government of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa which has donated land at Topi.\n\nThe university is situated beside the river Indus in the mountains of Tarbela and Gadoon-Amazai, in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa near the town of Topi and in proximity to the lakes of Tarbela Dam (world's largest earth-filled dam) and Ghazi.\nIts campus is in the mountains of Tarbela and Gadoon-Amazai, and is a residential campus with accommodation for students.\n\nClock Tower, (Landmark of Ghulam Ishaq Khan, aka LOGIK in short), is located in Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Topi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Amidst all the picturesque buildings of the institute stands erect the Clock Tower in all its glory. The clock tower can be seen from almost everywhere in the institute and has clocks on all four of its sides. It is the tallest structure in the area visible for many miles, and it provides a view of Tarbela Dam and the surrounding areas of Topi. It unites the institute on one time, and the student community is particularly fond of it.\n\nAdmission to the university is based on the entry test. The test has MCQs of Physics, Mathematics and English. Eligibility criteria for admission to the university is at least 60% marks in physics and mathematics in FSc or Grade C in A levels. Entry test for the university is very competitive as large number of prospective students compete for a limited number of seats.\n\nThe Faculty offers a 4-year degree program leading to Bachelor of Science in Engineering Sciences which encompasses some of the modern fields of engineering such as:\n\n\nThe faculty also offers MS and PHD degree programs in applied mathematics and applied physics.\n\nThe Faculty offers courses leading to Bachelor's (BS) in computer engineering and computer science.

Below the castle lies the ruin of the first Carmelite priory in Ireland which was built by the Norman, Carew in 1270.\n\nAt the northern entrance to the village is a sculpture by Michael Warren, depicting the thrones of the ancient seat of the Kings of South Leinster at Dinn Righ (The hill of the Kings). The Kings of Leinster lived near the village.\n\nOn the night of 28 November 1999, a brilliant exploding fireball was observed over Carlow town, which lasted for several seconds before fading and was accompanied by a loud detonation. An elderly lady in Leighlinbridge recovered a fusion crusted individual meteoritic rock on 12 December 1999, and later two more specimens were found. It is now officially called the \"Leighlinbridge\" by the International Meteorite Nomenclature Committee. The meteorites, totalling 271.4 grams in weight, were at the time the first recovered in Ireland since 1865 and are the first fallen rocks found anywhere in Ireland or Britain since 1991. The previous find in Ireland was the Dundrum meteorite which was found near Dundrum, County Tipperary.\n\nIn Leighlinbridge there are three GAA clubs, Naomh Bríd, Leighlinbridge and Micheal Davitts.

It has a picturesque Old Town, located in the Rheingau landscape celebrated in Rhine romanticism.\n\nRüdesheim am Rhein as a municipality consists of five quarters:\nAssmannshausen, Aulhausen and Presberg have the status of an \"Ortsbezirk\". Central Rüdesheim and Eibingen form a combined fourth Ortsbezirk.\n\nRüdesheim borders in the north and north-west on the town of Lorch, in the east on the town of Geisenheim. On the left bank of the Rhine in Rhineland-Palatinate, Rüdesheim faces the town of Bingen to the south, and the villages of Weiler und Trechtingshausen to the south-west. Rüdesheim is connected with the left Rhine bank by a ferry for pedestrians and one for cars.\n\nThe area was settled first by the Celts, then after the turn of the Christian Era by Ubii and later by Mattiaci. In the first century, the Romans pushed forth to the Taunus. In Bingen they built a castrum, and on the other side, near what is now Rüdesheim, lay a bridgehead on the way to the Limes.\n\nThe Romans were followed by the Alamanni, and during the Migration Period the Franks migrated into the region. Archaeological finds of glass from this time suggest that there was already winegrowing in Rüdesheim. The town's origin as a Frankish \"Haufendorf\" (roughly: \"clump village\") can still be seen on today's town maps.\n\nRüdesheim was first mentioned in a document in 1074. Its livelihood came mainly from winegrowing and shipping, particularly timber rafting.\n\nOn 1 January 1818, Rüdesheim received town rights. After Prussia annexed the Duchy of Nassau in 1867 and divided the area into districts (\"Kreise\"), Rüdesheim became a district seat in the newly founded Rheingaukreis. It held this status 110 years until 1977, when in the course of municipal reform in Hesse the districts of the Rheingaukreis and the Untertaunuskreis were merged into the new Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis, and Rüdesheim had to yield the district seat to Bad Schwalbach.\n\nIn 1877, the first foundation stone was laid for the Niederwalddenkmal, a patriotic monument above the vineyards which would be finished in 1883. It attracted many tourists who could reach it on a cog railway. Today, a gondola lift brings visitors up to the monument. Tourism has more and more replaced shipping as a source of income.\n\nIn 1939, under the secrecy that held sway at the time, the formerly self-governing community of Eibingen was forcibly amalgamated with the town by the National Socialists, against the community inhabitants' will. In 1977, within the framework of municipal reform, Assmannshausen, Aulhausen and Presberg were incorporated into Rüdesheim as \"Ortsbezirke\".\n\nThe municipal election for the town council (German: \"Stadtverordnetenversammlung\") was held on 6 March 2016 and yielded the following results, compared to previous elections:\n\n\n\nThe Rheinsteig from Wiesbaden to Bonn leads through Rüdesheim's municipal area by both the Eibingen Abbey and the Niederwalddenkmal. Another trail is the Riesling-Route. It leads along the Rhine and through Rüdesheim's vineyards on the way to Wiesbaden.\n\nA well known tradition is the \"Weinkönigin\" (\"Wine Queen\") with her princesses. Each year in the summertime, the Rüdesheim wine festival is held, whose highlights include the Wine Queen's and the princesses' coronation. They represent the town of Rüdesheim and its wine in other communities and winegrowing areas.\n\nIn the deeds held by the Counts of Katzenelnbogen, vineyards are already found in the Rüdesheim area in 1399: \"auf dem Berge\" (\"on the mountain\"), \"bei dem Morgen Marschalls\" (\"near Marshal's acre\") and \"unterhalb Eibingen am Fluß\" (\"beneath Eibingen at the river\").\n\nRüdesheim lies in the north-west corner of the German wine-producing region Rheingau. Riesling grapes are the main type grown in this area, producing mainly high-quality white wines.\n\nRüdesheim (Rhein) station is on the East Rhine Railway and is served by trains running at least hourly during the day to Frankfurt and Koblenz.\n\n\nThe town's medieval noble family called itself \"von Rüdesheim\". One of its members was Rudolf of Rüdesheim (1402–1482), papal legate and since 1468 Prince-Bishop of Breslau.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the folk rock group Buffalo Springfield, a founding member of the pioneering country rock band Poco, and half of the soft rock duo Loggins and Messina with Kenny Loggins.\n\nJames Messina was born in Maywood, California, in 1947, and raised in Harlingen, Texas, until he was eight. He spent much of his childhood split between his father's home in California and his mother's home in Texas. His father was a guitarist and greatly influenced his son's musical career. Messina began playing the guitar at the age of five. He later became interested in the music of Elvis Presley and Ricky Nelson.\n\nWhen he was 16 years old, he recorded an LP with \"His Jesters\" titled \"The Dragsters\", which was released in November 1964. One notable track was \"The Jester\", on which he played lead guitar; it was included on the 2003 CD \"Lost Legends of Surf Guitar Volume 1\".\n\nWhile with Buffalo Springfield, Messina served as a recording engineer, producer, and musician, replacing bass player Bruce Palmer on two songs from their final album, \"Last Time Around\".\n\nAfter Buffalo Springfield disbanded, Messina and Richie Furay, a founding member of Buffalo Springfield, formed Poco in 1968. Switching back from bass to guitar, Messina played lead guitar and supplied vocals and some songwriting to the band. After recording two studio albums and one live album, he left Poco due to exhaustion from touring and to focus on becoming a record producer.\n\nAfter Poco, Messina signed a contract with Columbia Records as an independent producer. Messina was first introduced to the idea of producing Kenny Loggins in the summer of 1970 while still performing on the road with Poco. Loggins first met Messina in December 1970 at Messina's home, where the two recorded a number of Loggins' compositions in Messina's living room. Loggins at the time was a songwriter for ABC Dunhill and not a performing artist. The songs he presented for his album leaned toward folk. The inexperienced Loggins had no agent, no manager, no business manager, and no prior experience as a performing artist. Messina felt Loggins needed some kind of an edge, and should embrace a more modern sound.\n\nIn the course of deciding how to produce Loggins' first solo album, Messina met with Clive Davis, then president of Columbia Records. Messina proposed to Davis that he be allowed to sit in with Loggins on his first solo album in the same way that jazz artists had done in the past, and stated that Loggins also needed more upbeat and diverse material to help him gain appeal as a pop music artist. After reluctantly agreeing, Davis pursued the \"Sitting In\" concept through to the end.\n\nWith music trends moving away from folk, Messina presented Loggins with a number of songs that spilled over from his days with Poco and Buffalo Springfield. He felt Loggins could do both country rock and R&B styles extremely well, especially after hearing Loggins perform \"Danny's Song.\"\n\nAmong the material Messina contributed was \"Listen to a Country Song\" (which would be a hit single for Lynn Anderson when she recorded it the following year), \"Nobody But You,\" \"Same Old Wine,\" and \"The Trilogy,\" which included \"Peace of Mind.\" He provided the rehearsal space, amps, and instruments and lent his talents as an arranger, vocalist, and guitarist. Messina worked long hours with Loggins and encouraged him to purchase an electric guitar and play it on his solo debut album.\n\nMessina assembled \"The Kenny Loggins Band\" by summoning old friends drummer Merel Bregante and bassist/singer Larry Sims (both formally of The Sunshine Company), multireedist/violinist Al Garth, multireedist Jon Clarke (performing with the Don Ellis Jazz Band), and a friend of Loggins, keyboardist Michael Omartian, who played on the album but dropped out once the touring began. However, Omartian played on the next two albums, and the ensemble was also augmented on each of their studio releases by Los Angeles-based session percussionist Milt Holland.\n\nThough the album was originally intended to be Loggins' first solo album, the two decided that Messina's contribution was so substantial that the album was finally released as \"Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin' In\", in November 1971. Messina had been reluctant to perform and tour, having begun the collaboration with the sole interest of producing. Nonetheless, by the end of 1976, the group, now renamed \"Loggins and Messina\", had toured extensively; they would eventually sell over 20 million albums.\n\nAfter the release of \"Sittin' In\", Messina went on to write, perform and produce seven more albums with Loggins. Those albums were \"Loggins and Messina\" (1972), \"Full Sail\" (1973), \"On Stage\" (1974), \"Mother Lode\" (1974), \"So Fine\" (1975, a covers album), \"Native Sons\" (1976, their last studio release) and \"Finale\" (1977, released by Columbia after the duo's split).\n\nLoggins ultimately decided to strike out on his own, and in 1976 the duo split after a final concert in Hawaii. Both went on to solo careers.\n\nIn 1979, Messina met with Don Ellis (not to be confused with Don Ellis the jazz musician who recorded for the same label) of Columbia Records subsidiary A&R to plan his first solo album. He learned that Ellis did not like Messina's new musical direction, towards Latin jazz with a rock edge, because it did not sound like a Loggins and Messina album. Messina toured to support the debut LP, which sold 150,000 copies, about the same sales as \"Sittin' In\" had had. However, without the support of the record company, the album stalled, peaking at #58 on the Billboard 200, and Messina asked Columbia Records president Bruce Lundvall for a release from the label. Its single, \"New And Different Way\", slightly missed the Top 40 on the AC chart, peaking at #43.\n\nIn 1981, Messina signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded and released his second solo effort, \"Messina\", which included folk, rock, latin and light jazz elements. The album featured singer Pauline Wilson, who sang a duet with Messina on \"Stay the Night\".\n\nIn 1983, Messina released his third solo album with Warner Bros., \"One More Mile\". The album leaned more toward rock, and Messina used a number of young and upcoming studio musicians as his rhythm section. The album also featured Edie Laymen and Pauline Wilson singing background and harmony parts. On the song \"The Island\", he shows his influence of slack key, a Hawaiian style of playing the guitar.\n\nIn 1993, Brooks and Dunn recorded \"Mexican Minutes\" written by Jim Messina and co-authored with Kent Robbins in Nashville.\n\nIn 1989, Poco's original lineup (consisting of Messina, Richie Furay, Rusty Young, George Grantham and Randy Meisner) regrouped for a successful reunion tour. That same year, they released the album \"Legacy\". Messina played guitar and mandolin on the album. He wrote and sang on three of the songs: \"Follow Your Dreams\", \"Look Within\" and \"Lovin' You Every Minute.\" He also co-wrote the song \"Call It Love\", which was sung by Rusty Young. That song reached number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1989.\n\nIn 2005, Messina and Loggins hit the road as a duo again. They had a successful nationwide tour that produced a CD and DVD entitled \"\" Messina also pulled from the vaults the original master analog recordings that he had produced and mixed for Loggins and Messina at Columbia Records, which were released as the 2005 digitally mastered compilation album \"\".\n\nThe duo reformed again in 2009 for an extensive tour.\n\nIn 2009, Messina released the CD \"Under a Mojito Moon-Part 1\", on which the only guitar he played was his flamenco guitar. The Latin-based arrangements feature trumpet, percussion, drums, piano and nylon acoustic guitar in melodies reminiscent of the music of Cuba and Spain.\n\nIn 2012, Messina released the CD and DVD \"Jim Messina LIVE at the Clark Center for the Performing Arts\" containing songs by The Buffalo Springfield, Poco, Loggins & Messina as well as his solo material.\n\nHe continues to work in the field of publishing, production and electronics as a recording and mixing engineer and as a recording studio owner.\n\nHe is both the creator and facilitator of \"The Songwriters' Performance Workshop\", wherein he leads 6-day intensive workshops for songwriters and singers at retreats, resorts and hotels around the country.\n\nIn addition to music, Messina dabbles as a painter working both in watercolor and acrylics. He is also a carpenter who enjoys building \"cowboy\" furniture and old distressed Scottish and Irish style of pine furniture. He also works in metal and welding.\n\nIn 1970, Messina married actress Jenny Sullivan; the marriage ended ten years later in 1980. They had no children. Messina had his son, Julian, in 1992 during a relationship in the early 1990s. In 2001, Messina met his second wife, Michaela Laza Messina, an opera singer and a music teacher and their marriage brought about their daughter, Josey, in 2006. Josey directs, edits, and creates special effects while making home movies with her friends and her pets. She also plays the violin.\n\nMessina's son, Julian, is a recording engineer and a musician who has played the drums since he was four years old.\n\nMessina currently resides in Santa Barbara County, California.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is also a contributor to \"ESPN The Magazine\" and \"ESPN.com.\" \n\nHe guests on \"Golic and Wingo\" on Thursdays at 7:44 a.m., discussing the latest in happenings in Major League Baseball. He is a frequent contributor to Buster Olney's podcast. He also appears regularly on \"The Dan LeBatard Show\" and \"The Tony Kornheiser Show\".\n\nKurkjian was born in Bethesda, Maryland, to Badrig \"Jeff\" Kurkjian, a mathematician, and Joyce \"Joy\" Kurkjian. Badrig's parents settled in Watertown, Massachusetts after the Armenian Genocide, while Joyce was born in England. Badrig was a statistician who earned degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, George Washington and American Universities, taught at the University of Alabama, was the chief mathematician for the United States Army Materiel Command and was a fellow with the American Statistical Association. He was also an avid baseball fan who instilled in his son his love of both the sport and of statistics from a young age. According to Kurkjian, his family constantly talked and thought about baseball. Both of Kurkjian's older brothers played college baseball for the Catholic University Cardinals and were inducted into that school's athletics hall of fame. In his youth, in addition to playing baseball, young Kurkjian collected baseball cards, played tabletop baseball games and read anything baseball-related that he could.\n\nKurkjian attended Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, where he played on the school's basketball and baseball teams. At the suggestion of his basketball coach, Kurkjian began writing for the student newspaper, \"The Pitch\", and the school's yearbook, \"The Wind-up.\" He eventually became the sports editor of \"The Pitch\" and realized that journalism would be the surest means of fulfilling his childhood dream of making a living in professional sports. He graduated from the school in 1974.\n\nIn 1974, Kurkjian enrolled at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism. While at Maryland, Kurkjian covered high school sports for his hometown newspaper, the \"Montgomery Journal\". Immediately after graduating from Maryland with a B.A. in journalism in 1978, Kurkjian took an entry-level position with the \"Washington Star\". By 1981, he became a staff writer. When the \"Star\" folded that year, he took a position with the \"Baltimore News-American\". That paper also went out of business within two months of Kurkjian's arrival. He began covering baseball as the Texas Rangers beat writer for \"The Dallas Morning News\" where he worked from 1981 to 1985. Kurkjian then covered the Baltimore Orioles for \"The Baltimore Sun\" beginning in 1986. He was a senior writer for \"Sports Illustrated\" from 1989 to 1997. In 1997, \"Sports Illustrated\" reassigned him to covering basketball. He served in this capacity for six months before accepting a job at ESPN as a baseball writer and television journalist in 1998 at 40 years old.\n\nHe authored his first book, \"America's Game\", in 2000 and released his second book, \"Is This a Great Game, or What?: From A-Rod's Heart to Zim's Head—My 25 Years in Baseball\" in May 2007. In 2016, he published his book \"I'm Fascinated by Sacrifice Flies: Inside the Game We All Love\". He was the 1999 and 2007 Commencement speaker at his alma mater, Walter Johnson High School, the 2008 speaker at Seneca Valley High School, and also delivered the winter commencement speech at the University of Maryland on December 19, 2007.\n\nIn 2012, while Kurkjian and fellow ESPN analyst John Kruk were on their annual bus tour around the spring training facilities, a new craze was created called Kurkjianing where players would impersonate Tim Kurkjian during interviews. Some of the players that did this were Tim Dillard of the Brewers, J. P. Arencibia of the Rangers, and Elliot Johnson of the Rays.\n\nKurkjian is a regular correspondent on ESPN Radio; he was frequently featured on the former SVP & Russillo show hosted by Scott Van Pelt and Ryen Russillo. One element of this that has proved popular with listeners is when Van Pelt reads out names of American sports stars in a comedic Baltimore accent, often making Kurkjian crease with laughter. Examples can be found on the ESPN website. Since Van Pelt's departure from his radio slot to anchor the late night SportsCenter show, the mantle of making Kurkjian laugh has been taken up by The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz, which uses its meme of people in the sports world, be they players, coaches or officials, who look like non-sporting people in mundane or ridiculous situations.\n\nOn November 26, 1983, Kurkjian married Kathleen Patrick. Kathy is a lawyer. The couple has one daughter, Kelly, an artist, and one son, Jeff, who hosts Jeff & Aimee in the Morning on KCYE radio in Las Vegas. Both Kelly and Jeff graduated from Syracuse University. His cousin is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Stephen Kurkjian and Bob Kurkjian who is an engineering teacher at the Learning Prep School in West Newton, MA.\n\nOn every day of the Major League Baseball season, from 1990 until 2010, Kurkjian cut every MLB box score out of a newspaper and taped them into a spiral notebook. Kurkjian estimates that this daily task, at 15 minutes per day over 20 seasons, consumed 40 days of his life. He stopped doing this due to the lack of newspapers printing box scores.\n\n"}

With the same calibre as the British Mallet's Mortar, constructed in May 1857, it is one of the largest-calibre guns ever built, having a larger calibre than both of Germany's \"Schwerer Gustav\" and \"Dora\" which were railway guns.\n\nThe mortar was originally used as the launching mechanism for test-firing aerial bombs at Aberdeen Proving Ground (during the war, bombs became larger and larger, necessitating the construction of such a large-calibre gun). Little David was therefore not intended as a combat weapon. The mortar's base was a large steel box that was placed below ground, with its top flush with the surrounding surface, allowing the mortar's muzzle to be lowered horizontal for loading at ground level.\n\nBy 1944, it was expected that American forces would encounter extremely strong fortifications during the expected invasion of Japan. Studies began on using Little David as a siege mortar. The mortar was converted into a two-piece mobile unit, consisting of the barrel and the base transported by two M25 tractors. In addition to the two main loads, the Little David unit would also include a bulldozer and crane with bucket to dig the emplacement for the mortar's base.\n\nThe huge mortar could be ready to fire in 12 hours. The largest (800 mm) known German artillery weapons were hauled on 25 railway cars and required three weeks to put in firing position, but had a longer range of compared to the of Little David.\n\nLittle David was one of the largest artillery pieces ever produced by calibre, although Dora fired a heavier shell. Little David's overall effectiveness would have been questionable because of its limited range and accuracy. When Japan surrendered, the invasion became unnecessary, and Little David (still in its trial phase) never saw combat.\n\nLittle David currently resides in the outdoor collection of armor and artillery pieces at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.\n\n\n"}

The denominations which featured the Goddess of Liberty in a Seated Liberty design included the half dime, the dime, the quarter, the half dollar, and until 1873 the silver dollar. Another coin that appeared exclusively in the Seated Liberty design was the twenty cent piece. This coin was produced from 1875 to 1878, and was discontinued because it looked very similar to the quarter. Seated Liberty coinage was minted at the main United States Mint in Philadelphia, as well as the branch mints in New Orleans, San Francisco, and Carson City.\n\nThe basic obverse design of the Seated Liberty coinage, designed by Mint engraver Christian Gobrecht and drawn by Thomas Sully, consisted of the figure of Liberty clad in a flowing dress and seated upon a rock. In her left hand, she holds a Liberty pole surmounted by a Phrygian cap, which had been a pre-eminent symbol of freedom during the movement of Neoclassicism (and in fact traces its roots back to Ancient Greece and Rome). Although it had fallen out of favor in Europe by 1830, Neoclassicism remained in vogue in the United States until after the American Civil War. Liberty's right hand rested on the top corner of a striped shield with a diagonal banner inscribed with the word \"Liberty\". The shield represented preparedness in the defense of freedom. The date of the coin appeared on the bottom below Liberty.\nThe basic reverse design of Seated Liberty coins depended on the denomination. The size of half dimes and dimes necessitated a smaller array of elements. On these coins, the reverse consistently featured a wreath around the words \"half dime\" or \"one dime\". Before 1860, this wreath consisted of laurel leaves, a traditional Neoclassical image, but beginning that year, the wreath was enlarged and was filled not only with leaves, but also traditional American agricultural products, such as corn and wheat. On quarter, half dollars, and silver dollar coins, the reverse featured a central eagle about to take flight, with a striped shield upon its breast. The eagle clutched an olive branch of peace in its right talons and a group of arrows in its left talons. Above the eagle around the rim were the words \"United States of America\" and below the eagle around the rim lay the coin denomination. Beginning in 1866, the coins featured a ribbon with the motto \"In God We Trust\" above the eagle.\n\nWhen the first Seated Liberty half dimes and dimes appeared in 1837, the obverse contained no stars. There are two varieties; the large date and the small date. For the dime, these two types can be distinguished by noting the \"3\" and the \"7\" in the date. In the large date variety, the \"3\" has a pointy serif at top, and the horizontal element of the \"7\" is straight. In the small date variety, the \"3\" has a rounded serif, and there is small a knob, or bulge, in the \"7\" horizontal element. Only the Philadelphia Mint made both varieties. The small date is slightly rarer. The New Orleans Mint made only one variety. For the half dime, the small date can be distinguished by the fact that it is slightly bent in a \"smile\" orientation, similar to the Bust type of half dime. The large date can be distinguished by the fact that the date is more in a straight line, similar to dates of later years for the Seated Liberty. Only the Philadelphia Mint made half dimes in this year.\n\nThe Liberty Seated dime of 1838 minted in New Orleans, was the first U.S. coin struck anywhere outside of Philadelphia. In other words, this is the first branch mint coin.\n\nThe next year, the coins featured thirteen six-pointed stars around the rim, commemorating the original thirteen colonies.\n\nThe Seated Liberty coins featured a few minor design changes over the years. Around 1840 (the exact date depends upon the denomination), extra drapery was added to Liberty's left elbow.\n\nIn 1853 and 1873, the U.S. Mint changed the weight of each denomination of silver coins. Both times, arrows were added to the coins on each side of the date. These were removed from coins in 1856 and 1875, respectively. In 1853, the mint also placed rays around the eagle on the reverse of half dollars and quarters, a feature which endured for that one year only.\n\nIn 1860 the U.S. Mint eliminated the stars on the obverse of Seated Liberty half dimes and dimes, replacing them with the legend \"United States of America\", which had previously appeared around the wreath on the reverse of the coins. Before this time, half dimes and dimes minted in New Orleans and San Francisco had featured their mintmarks inside the wreaths. Afterwards, the \"O\" and \"S\" (and, later, the \"CC\" for Carson City) mintmarks were located below the wreath next to the rim. On quarters, half dollars, and silver dollars, the mintmarks were always placed below the eagle but above the coin currency on the reverse.\n\nMany people collect Seated coinage by variety. This can range from a repunched mintmark to the position of a date on the coin to a die crack at various stages. This type of collecting has been popular with Bust half dollars for well over 100 years. Seated coin collecting by variety has grown over the last 30 years with the formation of the Liberty Seated Collectors Club.\n\nThe Seated Liberty design remained standard on all American coins ranging from dimes to half dollars for decades, but by the 1880s, as it was approaching the half century mark, there was increased criticism and calls for its replacement, partially due to changing artistic tastes and perceived \"blandness\". This led to the new \"Barber Head\" design, approved by President Harrison in 1891 and which began minting a year later, although it too would soon be criticized for blandness.\n\n"}

{"id": "2034676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034676", "title": "Tourniquet (band)", "text": "Tourniquet (band)\n\nTourniquet is a Christian metal band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1989. The band was founded by Ted Kirkpatrick, Guy Ritter, and Gary Lenaire. The band primarily performs a mixture of thrash, progressive, and neoclassical metal, and is influenced by additional, non-rock forms of music such as classical and world music. It has earned six GMA Dove Award nominations and won multiple recognitions from the readers of \"HM Magazine\", including \"Favorite Band of the 1990s\" and \"Favorite Album of the 1990s\" for \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\" (1992). It has released ten studio albums, two compilation albums, one EP, and several video releases. Tourniquet has sold more than 300,000 albums. In addition to its use of classical music, the band is known for frequently using medical terminology in its album and song titles and lyrics.\n\nThe current Tourniquet lineup consists of Ted Kirkpatrick (drums) and Aaron Guerra (guitar, vocals, bass). The band's 2003 release, \"Where Moth and Rust Destroy,\" features special guests Marty Friedman, formerly of Megadeth, and Bruce Franklin, of Trouble, both on lead guitar. Tourniquet members are outspoken against animal abuse, and have appeared in publications such as \"The Vegetarian Times\", \"United Animal Nations\", and \"Animal Agenda\".\n\nThe band is named for the tourniquet, \"a surgical device for arresting hemorrhage by compression of a blood vessel.\" According to the band, a tourniquet is a metaphor for \"a lifelong spiritual process by which a personal God, through the atoning blood, death, and resurrection of His only Son—Jesus Christ—can begin to stop the flow of going through life without knowing and serving our Creator. He is our Tourniquet.\"\n\nTourniquet was formed in 1989 by drummer Ted Kirkpatrick, vocalist Guy Ritter, and guitarist/vocalist Gary Lenaire. Kirkpatrick had previously played in the Chicago doom metal group Trouble on their \"Run to the Light\" tour. The group was one of many bands who were, at the time, affiliated with a church group called Sanctuary - the rock and roll refuge in Los Angeles.\n\nTourniquet released its first studio album, \"Stop the Bleeding\", in 1990. It was produced by Bill Metoyer of Metal Blade Records, and released by Intense Records. While it was mostly distributed to Christian bookstores, \"Stop the Bleeding\" gained some notoriety in the mainstream metal scene, and is considered a notable thrash metal album. Tourniquet's style broke new ground and quickly gained them fans all over the world. Musically, the album showcased elements of 1980's speed metal with its Mercyful Fate/King Diamond influences, notably the falsetto vocals. In this line up, Guy Ritter sang the melodic vocal parts while Gary Lenaire did the aggressive, thrash metal shouts. Session guitarist Mark Lewis played lead guitars on the album. The band was later rounded out with the addition of bassist Victor Macias and lead guitarist Erik Mendez. This version of the group is commonly known as the \"classic\" line up of Tourniquet. The band, including Macias and Mendez, filmed a music video for the song \"Ark of Suffering\". The video had some limited airplay on MTV, but it was quickly pulled by the network due to violent content portraying animal abuse. Because of the song and its subsequent video, the band became known for its stance on animal rights.\n\nIn 1991, Tourniquet abandoned most of its 1980's metal influences and recorded a more modern sounding album titled \"Psycho Surgery\". On the song \"Spineless\", the band experimented with rap rock in the vein of Anthrax and Faith No More long before the style became popular in the late 1990s. \"Psycho Surgery\" showcased Kirkpatrick's classical music influences more prominently than \"Stop the Bleeding\", and his background in the pharmaceutical industry became apparent with many of the song's lyrics utilizing medical terminology as metaphors for social/spiritual issues. Some critics described it as if \"Slayer plays Beethoven in a slightly rewritten way\". On \"Psycho Surgery\" Tourniquet continued to work with producer Bill Metoyer, and signed a distribution agreement with Metal Blade Records. Metal Blade released \"Psycho Surgery\" to a wider general market audience than the band had been able to reach with \"Stop the Bleeding\". Intense Records released \"Psycho Surgery\" to Christian retail. Tourniquet released a home video (VHS) titled \"Video Biopsy\" the following year.\n\nIn 1992, Tourniquet released what is considered their most technical and dark album, \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\". Vocalist Guy Ritter had grown increasingly dissatisfied with the band's musical direction, and didn't care for the more aggressive material the rest of the band was writing. He subsequently left the band after the recording of \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\" due to these musical differences. Upon its release, \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\" quickly became one of the most popular of the band's albums among Tourniquet fans. It went on to be voted Favorite Album of the 1990s by the readers of \"HM Magazine\". As with the previous album, Metal Blade Records released \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\" to the general market, with Intense Records marketing it to Christian retail. Luke Easter replaced Ritter, joining Tourniquet for the \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\" tour. Prior to this Tourniquet was scheduled to play the Milwaukee Metalfest in 1993, but professed satanist Glen Benton of Deicide, the festival headliner, refused to play with a Christian band. The festival was forced to cancel Tourniquet's performance. This brought more publicity and notoriety to Tourniquet. That same year, Intense Records released \"Intense Live Series, Vol. 2\", which includes Tourniquet's cover of the Trouble song \"The Tempter\". It was recorded between Ritter's departure and Luke Easter joining the band with the melodic vocals being handled by Bloodgood vocalist, Les Carlsen.\n\nIn 1994, Tourniquet abandoned most of the medical terminology in their lyrics, altered their style to a more accessible heavy metal/hard rock sound, and released \"Vanishing Lessons\". Erik Mendez had left the band in 1993 after the tour for \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\", and so \"Vanishing Lessons\" was recorded by Tourniquet as a four-piece band. Soon after the album's completion, Aaron Guerra joined Tourniquet as Mendez's replacement in 1994. Metal Blade Records opted to not distribute \"Vanishing Lessons\", and Tourniquet continued to work exclusively with Intense Records until 1997. The album spawned the single \"Twilight\", which became the band's first CCM radio hit. A video was shot for the song \"Bearing Gruesome Cargo\", and was later released on the 1995 home video \"Pushin' Broom\".\n\nShortly after the release of \"Vanishing Lessons\", the band released an EP, \"Carry the Wounded\", in 1995. Some Tourniquet fans had mixed feelings toward the EP's softer sound and the inclusion of a ballad. The band later released a compilation album, \"The Collected Works of Tourniquet\", in 1996, which included two new songs \"Perfect Night for a Hanging\" and \"The Hand Trembler\". Many fans regard these as the heaviest songs Tourniquet has ever written.\n\nIn 1996, Victor Macias left the band of his own accord due to theological differences. Later that same year, Gary Lenaire was asked to leave Tourniquet. After Lenaire's departure, he and Ritter started the band Echo Hollow during that year.\n\nIn 1997, the band signed with Benson Records and released \"Crawl to China\". \"Crawl to China\" generated divided opinions with both critics and fans because of its diverse, experimental material.\n\nTed Kirkpatrick is known for his drum solos, and he performs them in nearly every Tourniquet concert. Many of these performances had been filmed, and in 1997 these clips were compiled on a home video release (VHS) titled \"The Unreleased Drum Solos of Ted Kirkpatrick\".\n\nIn 1998, the band recorded a number of songs in acoustic form, and released them on an album titled \"Acoustic Archives\". This release also included a new song titled \"Trivializing the Momentous, Complicating the Obvious\". That same year, Tourniquet released two home videos titled \"Guitar Instructional Video\" and \"Tourniquet Live in California\".\n\nIn 2000, Tourniquet began writing more thrash-oriented songs again. They signed directly to Metal Blade Records, and began work on \"Microscopic View of a Telescopic Realm\", their most technical album since \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\". The aforementioned albums generated comparisons to each other, and \"Microscopic View of a Telescopic Realm\" contained a sequel to the \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\" song \"The Skeezix Dilemma\" titled \"The Skeezix Dilemma Part II - The Improbable Testimony of the Pipsisewah\". The album received rave reviews from both fans and critics.\n\nIn 2001, Tourniquet reissued its first three albums, remastered and containing bonus tracks, on Pathogenic Records. In 2002, bassist Steve Andino - after filling in live for the band on many occasions - became an official member of Tourniquet. The band played various live venues until Aaron Guerra left the band for personal reasons.\n\nIn 2003, Ted Kirkpatrick, Luke Easter, and Steve Andino recorded Tourniquet's seventh studio album, \"Where Moth and Rust Destroy\", with the help of guitarists Marty Friedman (formerly of Megadeth) and Bruce Franklin (Trouble). This release continues the technical and progressive direction of their previous album. The songs \"Restoring the Locust Years\" and \"A Ghost at the Wheel\" received some radio play. That same year, Tourniquet released two DVDs. The first, \"Ocular Digital\", includes a live show from their 2001 performance at a Dutch festival called Flevo Festival, and a concert from 1991 in Escondido, California - the first Tourniquet concert ever. The second DVD release, titled \"Circadian Rhythms – The Drumming World of Ted Kirkpatrick\", included many newly recorded drum solos as well as a DVD version of \"The Unreleased Drum Solos of Ted Kirkpatrick\". This release also featured segments in which Ted, at his home and around town, answers questions from fans, and takes the viewer on a partial tour of his vast collection of butterflies and insects.\n\nAaron Guerra returned to Tourniquet in 2005, and they began to make sporadic appearances at concert events both in the U.S. and abroad. Notable shows include the Elements of Rock festival in Switzerland and Bobfest in Sweden. The Bobfest appearance was released on DVD as \"Till Sverige Med Kärlek\" (Swedish for \"To Sweden With Love\") in 2006.\n\nOn February 22, 2010, Blabbermouth.net reported that Tourniquet would record a new album in spring with noted producer Neil Kernon. The band stated, \"We plan to release it as soon as it's finished in fall of this year.\" Kirkpatrick also announced plans to release solo albums of stoner metal and drumming over classical music. On November 10, Tourniquet announced a partnership with Kickstarter.com to fund the album's recording with fan packages and experiences for anyone who contributes toward the new album budget. On May 21, 2012, a contest concluded where a fan guessed the new album name from a series of clues. The band announced, via their Facebook page, that the album would be titled \"Antiseptic Bloodbath\". The band re-released \"Tourniquet Live in California\" on DVD that same year.\n\nIn 2014, Kirkpatrick used Kickstarter to fund and release an album as The Tourniquet Ark called \"Onward to Freedom\". Kirkpatrick was the only Tourniquet member to play on all of the songs, although other members of Tourniquet were involved, along with a number of guest musicians.\n\nOn December 28, 2015, longtime vocalist, Luke Easter, left the band. In 2017, the band announced they were playing at Exodo Festival, with the lineup of Kirkpatrick on drums, Aaron Guerra and Jamey Henn on guitars, vocalist Jason Robison, and former Holy Soldier member Andy Robins on bass guitar.\n\nIn late 2017, Tourniquet began recording their tenth studio album. A week into 2018, the band announced that the album would come out shortly. On March 17, 2018, the band announced that Deen Castronovo was performing vocals for the title track of the album. A month later, Tourniquet announced the lineup of the title track, rounding it out with Chris Poland returning on lead guitars. The album, \"Gazing at Medusa\", was released in 2018.\n\nTourniquet's early albums are technical thrash metal and characterized by a dark atmosphere. The song writing is technically precise, and drummer Ted Kirkpatrick is known to play the guitar parts himself when he thinks that the other members' playing isn't precise enough. Kirkpatrick's drumming incorporates poly-rhythms and peculiar, technical patterns. Their first album is influenced by 1980s speed metal, but on later releases the band began incorporating more classical music in their songwriting, most notably on the albums \"Psycho Surgery\" and \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\". This is mostly due to Ted Kirkpatrick's role as the main songwriter. Kirkpatrick cites Beethoven, Bach, and other classical composers as some of his primary musical influences. While there are some progressive elements on \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\", such as on \"The Skeezix Dilemma\", their later releases \"Microscopic View of a Telescopic Realm\" and \"Where Moth and Rust Destroy\" have more marked progressive metal influences.\n\nTourniquet's lyrical influences span a wide range; ranging from Old Testament narrative, to medical allegories, to Edgar Allan Poe type descriptive horror. Many Kirkpatrick-penned lyrics incorporate medical terminology. Tourniquet has also dealt with unique social issues as well. \"Ark of Suffering\" (from \"Stop the Bleeding\") generated significant attention by addressing animal abuse. \"Ruminating Virulence\" (from \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\") discusses the severely disabled. \"Twilight\" (from \"Vanishing Lessons\") addresses the neglect of the elderly. All of these topics are addressed from a Biblical perspective.\n\nTheir music has received notice in the mainstream media, as well as the CCM market. The music video for \"Ark of Suffering\" received airplay on MTV, and garnered attention for its stance on animal abuse. Tourniquet has continued to take a very public stance on this issue, and so have been interviewed about it in magazines such as Vegetarian Times, Journal of the United Animal Nations, Animal's Agenda, and by PETA. Some critics have described them as being more proficient than many of their counterparts, and the band members have appeared in many music magazines. For example, Kirkpatrick has been featured on Modern Drummer, Drums, and Aaron Guerra has been interviewed in Guitar World and Guitar for the Practicing Musician.\n\nTourniquet has been the recipient of various awards.\n\n\nThe following songs have reached No. 1 in various sales and airplay charts:\n\n\nCurrent line-up\n\nCurrent live musicians\nFormer\n\nFormer live musicians\n\nSession musicians\nTimeline\nStudio albums\n\nLive albums\n\nCompilations\n\nEPs\n\nVideos\n\n\n"}

Claims made for the benefits of spinal adjustments range from temporary, palliative (pain relieving) effects to long term wellness and preventive care. Despite anecdotal success, there is no scientific evidence that spinal adjustment is effective against disease.\n\nThe intention of a chiropractic adjustment is to affect or correct the alignment, motion and/or function of a vertebral joint. Specifically, they are intended to correct \"vertebral subluxations\", the term given to the signs and symptoms that are said by chiropractors to result from abnormal alignment of vertebrae. (p. 218) This intention forms the legal and philosophical foundation of the profession, and US Medicare law formulates it in this manner:\n\nChiropractic authors and researchers Meeker and Haldeman write that the core clinical method that all chiropractors agree upon is spinal manipulation, although chiropractors much prefer to use the term spinal \"adjustment\", a term which reflects \"their belief in the therapeutic and health-enhancing effect of correcting spinal joint abnormalities.\" (p. 218)\n\nThe International Chiropractor's Association (ICA) states that the \"chiropractic spinal adjustment is unique and singular to the chiropractic profession\", and that it \"is characterized by a specific thrust applied to the vertebra utilizing parts of the vertebra and contiguous structures as levers to directionally correct articular malposition. Adjustment shall be differentiated from spinal manipulation in that the adjustment can only be applied to a vertebral malposition with the express intent to improve or correct the subluxation, whereas any joint, subluxated or not, may be manipulated to mobilize the joint or to put the joint through its range of motion. Chiropractic is a specialized field in the healing arts, and by prior rights, the spinal adjustment is distinct and singular to the chiropractic profession.\" One author claims that this concept is now repudiated by mainstream chiropractic. The definition of this procedure describes the use of a load (force) to specific body tissues with therapeutic intent. This \"load\" is traditionally supplied by hand, and can vary in its velocity, amplitude, duration, frequency, and body location (p. 218) and is usually abbreviated HVLA (high velocity low amplitude) thrust.\n\nAs the chiropractic profession grew, individual practitioners and institutions proposed and developed various proprietary techniques and methods. While many of these techniques did not endure, hundreds of different approaches remain in chiropractic practice today. Not all of them involve HVLA thrust manipulation. Most cite case studies, anecdotal evidence, and patient testimonials as evidence for effectiveness. These techniques include:\n\n\nThere are many techniques which chiropractors can specialize in and employ in spinal adjustments. Some of the most notable techniques include:\n\n\nOver the years, many variations of these techniques have been delivered, most as proprietary techniques developed by individual practitioners. WebMD has made a partial list:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effects of spinal adjustment vary depending on the method performed. All techniques claim effects similar to other manual therapies, ranging from decreased muscle tension to reduced stress. Studies show that most patients go to chiropractors for musculoskeletal problems: 60% with low back pain, and the rest with head, neck and extremity symptoms. (p. 219) Also the article \"Chiropractic: A Profession at the Crossroads of Mainstream and Alternative Medicine\" states that, “chiropractic was to be a revolutionary system of healing based on the premise that neurologic dysfunction caused by ‘impinged’ nerves at the spinal level was the cause of most dis-ease”. (p. 218) The mechanisms that are claimed to alter nervous system function and affect overall health are seen as speculative in nature, however, clinical trials have been conducted that include “placebo-controlled comparisons [and] comparisons with other treatments”. (p. 220) The American Chiropractic Association promotes chiropractic care of infants and children under the theory that “poor posture and physical injury, including birth trauma, may be common primary causes of illness in children and can have a direct and significant impact not only on spinal mechanics, but on other bodily functions”.\n\nThe effects of spinal manipulation have been shown to include: temporary relief of musculoskeletal pain, increased range of joint motion, changes in facet joint kinematics, increased pain tolerance and increased muscle strength. (p. 222) Common side effects of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) are characterized as mild to moderate and may include: local discomfort, headache, tiredness, or radiating discomfort. (p. 222).\n\nThere is no sufficient data to establish safety of spinal manipulations. The rate of adverse events is unknown. Adverse events are increasingly reported in randomized clinical trials of spinal manipulation but remain under–reported despite recommendations in the 2010 CONSORT guidelines. It is frequently associated with mild to moderate temporary adverse effects, and also serious outcomes which can result in permanent disability or death, which include strokes, spinal disc herniation, vertebral and rib fractures and cauda equina syndrome. Serious outcomes are very rare. About half of people reported encountering adverse effects following spinal manipulation.\n\n"}

It serves as the flagship station of Bloomberg Radio, Bloomberg L.P.'s radio service. The station offers general and financial news reports 24-hours a day, along with local information and interviews with corporate executives, economists and industry analysts.\n\nWBBR's studios are in Bloomberg Headquarters on Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The transmitter and four-tower antenna array are located in Carlstadt, New Jersey near the Hackensack River.\n\nThe original Bloomberg Radio weekday news format divided each hour of the day into six 10-minutes segments, containing financial market updates, business headlines, traffic, weather, sports, a human interest piece or a general updates about cultural happenings. However, by 2010, Bloomberg Radio had shifted from a headline service to a discussion-based format in order to offer more in-depth market and economic analysis. Each day, the station broadcasts more than 20 live interviews with economists, market analysts, authors and politicians on shows such as \"Bloomberg Surveillance\" with Tom Keene, which airs weekday mornings from 7 a.m to 10 a.m. Late nights and early mornings, WBBR airs \"Daybreak Asia\" and \"Daybreak Europe,\" carried from Bloomberg television services on those continents.\n\nFrom Friday evening after the U.S. stock markets close, until Sunday evening, when Asian markets open, WBBR airs hour-long shows on business-related subjects. There are programs on politics, law, sports, a columnists roundtable discussing news stories from the past week, and interviews with successful business leaders. WBBR breaks from the radio network on Sundays to carry the audio from \"Meet The Press\", \"Fox News Sunday\" and \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\". On weekends, WBBR begins most hours with Westwood One News briefs.\n\nAn audio simulcast of most Bloomberg Radio programming is available on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, Channel 113. Additionally, Bloomberg programming is syndicated to local radio stations across the country. Bloomberg stations are heard in Washington, D.C. (WDCH-FM 99.1), San Francisco (KNEW 910 AM) and Boston (WRCA 1330 AM and FM 106.1). Bloomberg does not own these network stations, but instead has leasing arrangements with Entercom (D.C.), iHeartMedia (San Francisco) and the Beasley Broadcast Group (Boston). Each station airs its own local news, weather, traffic and commercials during network cutaways.\n\nBloomberg Radio has a live stream on Bloomberg.com., separate from the audio heard on 1130 WBBR.\n\nWBBR serves as an overflow station for 660 WFAN, carrying games from New York and New Jersey sports teams, mainly the New Jersey Devils and Brooklyn Nets, when there are scheduling overlaps. WBBR also carries Westwood One's coverage of the annual Masters Tournament. During these sports broadcasts, the regular Bloomberg Radio programming continues online-only.\n\nSome hours of the schedule, one-and-a-half minute NBC Sports Radio updates are heard. WBBR became an affiliate when NBC Sports Radio first began in 2012, but only taking sports updates, not full length programming.\n\nFor most of its first 70 years on the air, WBBR had been radio station WNEW. WNEW was known for its popular adult music selection as well as its staff of radio personalities including Martin Block, Dee Finch, Gene Rayburn, Gene Klavan, Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins, Ted Brown and William B. Williams. WNEW is credited with pioneering the role of the disc jockey, as well as for developing the modern morning radio show format and debuting the first all-night radio show. In addition to its music and entertainment programming, WNEW featured an award-winning news staff and became \"The Voice of New York Sports\" for its coverage of New York Giants football team as well as the New York Rangers hockey and New York Knicks basketball. After years of declining ratings and management changes in the 1980s, WNEW was purchased by Bloomberg L.P. in 1992 and changed call letters to WBBR on December 15.\n\nThe station's origins go back to 1922 as WAAM in Newark, and 1925 as WODA in Paterson. The two stations merged, taking the new call sign WNEW to represent NEWark, NEW Jersey. The city of license changed from Newark to New York City only after the station's ownership changed hands.\n\nWNEW was acquired in 1934 by advertising executive Milton H. Biow and watch manufacturer Arde Bulova, under the name The Greater New York Broadcasting Company. It also acquired the Manhattan broadcasting studios which had been constructed for the recently failed Amalgamated Broadcasting System. New York socialite Bernice Judis was hired as WNEW's first General Manager, making her a rare female executive during the \"Golden Age of Radio.\" The call sign remained the same, to represent \"the NEWest thing in radio.\"\n\nAs an independent radio station, WNEW lacked the funds larger networks National Broadcasting Company, Columbia Broadcasting System and Mutual Broadcasting System used to produce daily programming, such as comedy shows, soap operas, game shows and dramatic programs. However, Judis was not discouraged, and welcomed the opportunity to develop her own schedule of innovative programming that included playing recordings of popular music throughout the day, creating the first all-night radio show, dubbed \"The Milkman's Matinee\", and cultivating a line-up of popular morning radio show personalities.\n\nIn 1935, WNEW pioneered the concept of a disc jockey when staff announcer Martin Block needed to fill time between news bulletins during his coverage of the Lindbergh kidnapping trial of Bruno Hauptmann. Block did not have access to a live orchestra to play music during the breaks as most network stations did, so he played records instead. Soon afterward, he piloted a 15-minute experimental show called the \"Make Believe Ballroom\", during which he played records from popular bands and singers, posed as a live performance in an imaginary ballroom. During Block's tenure as host of \"Make Believe Ballroom\", the show attracted 25% of the listening audience in New York City. The show continued in sporadic runs until the station's end in 1992.\n\nIn 1936, as the popularity of recorded music grew, WNEW was the defendant in a lawsuit initiated by bandleaders Paul Whiteman, Sammy Kaye and Fred Waring. They claimed that the playing of records on radio broadcasts was undermining performers' network contracts, which often called for exclusive services. The court ruled that WNEW, after purchasing each record, was allowed to broadcast it regardless of the resistance from artists. WNEW's victory subsequently authorized radio stations across the country to start playing recorded music and brought about the modern radio programming landscape.\n\nBefore 1941, WNEW broadcast on 1250 kilocycles, 2,500 watts by day, 1,000 watts at night. But when the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) went into effect, WNEW moved to 1130 kHz. It got a boost to 10,000 watts full-time.\n\nIn 1942, Judis set up a broadcast desk at the New York Daily News and WNEW became one of the first stations to carry hourly newscasts, something that would become commonplace in the industry over the next fifteen years. The station ended its association with the Daily News in 1958 and went on to build its own news department with 13 reporters and writers.\n\nWNEW was acquired in March 1954 by a group led by Richard D. Buckley, the future founder of Buckley Broadcasting. Less than eighteen months later, in October 1955 the station changed hands again with Buckley joining two new partners, television producer and investor Jack Wrather and banker John L. Loeb. Then, in March 1957 WNEW was purchased by the DuMont Broadcasting Corporation, the former owner of the DuMont Television Network; the sale to DuMont made WNEW a sister station to former DuMont network flagship WABD (channel 5). The TV station changed its call letters to WNEW-TV in 1958, and DuMont Broadcasting would later evolve into Metromedia.\nThrough the 1950s and 1960s, WNEW's programming was largely based on a personality-driven format, with a line-up of DJs who were ground-breaking at the time. Comedian Dee Finch teamed up with Gene Rayburn, and later Gene Klavan, on the long-running morning show \"Anything Goes\". It often playfully mocked its own advertisers, who in turn were still eager to have their products touted on the popular show.\n\nDuring this time, pop music was dividing between rock and roll and popular standards. Some stations moved to a predominantly rock and roll format and became known as \"Top 40\" stations, where the best-selling songs were played frequently, while others played popular adult standards, along with the softer hits from the current charts, earning the name \"Middle of the Road\" or MOR for short. DJs Ted Brown, Al Collins and William B. Williams helped define the MOR musical character of WNEW, lending their own \"professionalism and elegance\" to popular standards music that included Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Dean Martin, Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, Pat Boone, Patti Page, Bobby Darin, Ray Charles, Tony Bennett, Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers, McGuire Sisters, Ella Fitzgerald, Perry Como, Dinah Shore and Peggy Lee.\n\nIn 1957, an FM station was added, WNEW-FM at 102.7 MHz. At first WNEW-FM simulcast the AM station. But in 1966, it broke away from the AM station each weekday after the morning show. WNEW-FM continued to play similar music as the AM station, but using different songs. The same DJs were heard on the FM station, but only a few times each hour, as they continued to put most of their focus on the AM programming. Then on July 4, 1966, WNEW-FM tried a twist, an all-female DJ staff. Female radio announcers were still rare at that time. The female DJs on FM 102.7 failed to attract much of an audience since the men on AM 1130 remained quite popular. The experiment ended the following year, with WNEW-FM becoming a progressive rock station.\n\nThe news department at WNEW flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s and was considered among the best news operations at an independent radio station. WNEW sent reporters around the world to places like Cuba to interview Fidel Castro and to Africa to interview medical missionary Albert Schweitzer. In 1960, the station won a Peabody Award and an Associated Press Award for the best regularly scheduled news program in New York. Aerospace author Martin Caidin anchored live broadcasts for WNEW during early American space launches in the 1960s, traveling to Cape Canaveral to report on-site.\n\nLong-time General Manager Bernice Judis left WNEW in 1959 and was replaced by John Van Buren Sullivan, who started the station's affiliation with the New York Giants football team in 1960. Since home games were blacked out on television, as much as 60% of the New York radio audience relied on WNEW for play-by-play game coverage. WNEW later aired Mets, Rangers and Knicks games, as \"The Voice of New York Sports\" for more than 30 years.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, contemporary artists like Bobby Vinton, Connie Francis, Wayne Newton, Steve Lawrence, Andy Williams and Dinah Washington were added, as well as softer songs by rock artists like Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Association, The 5th Dimension and Petula Clark were heard. The station also played a couple of big band songs from the 1930s and 1940s per hour. Beginning in 1965, WNEW cut back on big bands, playing them only occasionally. The station also cut back on standards artists, airing them about four times each hour. The airstaff was ordered to stop playing standards and big bands from their own personal collections and were ordered to remove them from the station. WNEW focused more on soft rock and played more charting hits on the Adult Contemporary music charts.\n\nThe 1970s marked a period of decline for WNEW as listeners' musical tastes continued to evolve. The station struggled to maintain an adult pop standards audience that was being replaced by an expanding youth market. In an effort to attract at least some younger listeners, WNEW continued to air softer Top 40 hits, despite resistance from established DJs like William B. Williams, who helped build WNEW's pop standards tradition. In 1971, WNEW shifted its programming again and evolved into a full service adult contemporary format. The station also cut back on music during morning and afternoon drive times. The \"Milkman's Matinee\" name for overnight broadcasts was shelved for a time. The program director fired anyone who was rumored to have objected to the changes, including longtime sportscaster Marty Glickman. Marv Albert was brought in to replace Glickman. Still, the station played a couple standards per hour and a big band song every few hours but also played many soft to mid-tempo top 40 hits one would not expect to hear on a MOR station. WNEW was classified by trade publications as Adult Contemporary and Pop Adult. Many of the current songs were AC only hits. Also, WNEW played a moderate amount of 50s and 60s rock and roll artists, along with some Motown hits. WNEW also had \"Million Dollar Weekends\" focusing on oldies from the 50s and 60s along with an occasional standard.\n\nWith FM radio taking a larger share of young listeners, WNEW as an AM station opted to return to its roots in pop standards in 1976, reinstating \"Milkman's Matinee\" on overnights. In October 1979, \"Make Believe Ballroom\" was reinstated in middays. Initially, the station mixed in additional big bands and standards in with the AC format. In 1980, WNEW slowly began reducing AC hits. Later in the fall, the station went to all big bands and standards with the exception of morning and afternoon drive times. Million Dollar Weekends also became strictly Standards and Big Bands. In January 1981 WNEW converted to big bands and standards 24 hours a day and deepened the selection of songs.\n\nBy 1981, WNEW focused on album cuts by standards artists. The morning show focused on more hit based easy listening standards with some big bands mixed in. Middays played music from the 1930s and 1940s, with a mix of big bands and crooners. Afternoons concentrated on a mix of deep cuts by vocalists along with some big bands. Late nights featured traditional jazz. On overnights, WNEW launched a jazz show in 1986, blending traditional, modern and smooth jazz.\n\nWNEW was separated from its television sister station in March 1986, when WNEW-TV (now WNYW) and Metromedia's other television outlets came into the ownership of Fox Broadcasting Company, then owned by 20th Century Fox and controlled by Rupert Murdoch. But two years later in 1988, WNEW went through a major ownership change as Metromedia sold half interest in the station to Westwood One for $22 million.\n\nEven with new additions to programming such as Larry King's overnight radio show, the station's ratings continued to decline. Westwood One was forced to cut costs and downsize staff in an effort to attract potential buyers. By 1988, WNEW began to focus on bigger hits by standards artists. The music focused more on 50s and 60s easy listening artists. In 1990, WNEW began mixing in soft hits by baby boomer pop artists such as Neil Diamond, The Carpenters, The Righteous Brothers, Carole King, Barry Manilow, Lionel Richie and Linda Ronstadt. Late in 1991, WNEW backed off this type of music and focused again on traditional standards artists. WNEW continued cutting staff and local news in an attempt to remain profitable.\n\nWNEW was put up for sale in 1991, with Bloomberg L.P. purchasing the station for $13.5 million. In the period before the format change, the airstaff was given an opportunity to say goodbye, culminating on December 10 and December 11, 1992, when the station had one big farewell show. During this farewell show, the airstaff remembered WNEW highlights and talked about the end of an era. The show ended at 8:15 p.m. on the 11th, as Mark Simone signed off for the last time with the entire current and many living former personalities at his side. The last two songs played were by Frank Sinatra: \"Here's That Rainy Day\" and \"We'll Meet Again.\" WNEW joined NBC Talknet in progress, followed by Larry King as usual.\n\nThen, after Larry King, beginning at 2:00 a.m. Saturday morning and throughout that day, WNEW began simulcasting WYNY for three days. The station only broke away for New York Giants football, Talknet, and Larry King. On December 15, the sale of WNEW to Bloomberg became final, with the station continuing to simulcast WYNY until 4:00 p.m. Then, after airing the \"Perry Como Christmas Special\", shows from Talknet, and the first hour of Larry King, the station signed off at 11:59 p.m. The airing of \"The Larry King Show\" ended abruptly and the pre-recorded voice of engineering director Alan Kirschner was broadcast, stating \"At this time, 1130 WNEW New York will leave the air forever. Thanks for your support over the years. This is WNEW, New York\".\n\nAt the transmitter site, engineer Rene Tetro then turned off the transmitter for two minutes, switching to the new feed from the Bloomberg offices. The station signed back on the air at 12:01 a.m. with the new call sign WBBR. The station then began simulcasting WQEW (1560 AM, now WFME), then owned by the \"New York Times\". In anticipation of the end of WNEW, WQEW began broadcasting a standards format some two weeks earlier. Over the next several weeks, WQEW asked listeners to 1130 to switch their dials to 1560. The simulcast ended on January 4, 1993, when WBBR's business news format debuted.\n\n"}

The university is organized into eight faculties which contain twelve academic departments. It is considered one of the most important higher education institutions of Peru.\n\nIn 1901, during the government of President Eduardo López de Romaña, the creation of the National School of Agriculture and Veterinary Science was planned with the participation of a Belgian mission. The official inauguration of the school was on July 22, 1902. In 1912, the Central Agronomic Station was created with the purpose of developing the agricultural sector. A campus in the Fundo Santa Beatriz served as the school's first location. The university's current campus, in La Molina, was inaugurated in 1933. In 1960, the school was officially recognized as a university and was renamed to its current name.\n\nIn 1961, the faculties of Agriculture, Animal Science, Agricultural Engineering and the Institute for Research and Advanced Studies began work as academic organizations. In the same year, the institution decreed the creation of the Faculty of Life and Physical Sciences and the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences (both simultaneously started work in early 1962). The faculties of Forestry Science, of Fisheries Science and of Food Sciences and Technology began operating in 1963,1966 and 1969 respectively.\n\nThe National Agrarian University is governed by the University Act No. 23733, promulgated on December 9, 1983, which maintains the academic departments, restored the faculty system and frees each university to organize and establish its own academic system, according to their characteristics and needs.

By March 2013, her net worth was estimated at $1.2 billion according to \"Forbes\". \n\nSafra has a significant art collection and owns the historic Villa Leopolda on the French Riviera. In 2018, Lily Safra ranked #1756 on the \"Forbes\" World's Billionaires list, with wealth listed at US $1.3 billion.\n\nLily Safra was born Lily Watkins on 30 December 1934 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. She is the daughter of Wolf White Watkins, a Czechoslovak railway engineer who moved to South America, and Annita Noudelman de Castro, a Uruguayan of Russian Jewish ancestry. She grew up in Rio de Janeiro but moved with her family to Uruguay.\n\nAt age 17, she met and married Mario Cohen, an Argentine hosiery magnate of Italian-Jewish descent. They had three children. Lily and Cohen divorced in the early 1960s.\nIn 1965, she married Alfredo \"Freddy\" Monteverde, formerly Greenberg. He was a Romanian Jewish immigrant who fled Europe in 1939. He was a leader in the Brazilian household appliance distribution business, where he established the Ponto Frio brand. He and Lily adopted a child. In 1969, Monteverde committed suicide. According to biographer Isabel Vincent, Monteverde left all his assets to his wife. A month after his death, Lily Monteverde moved to London. Her late husband's banker, Edmond Safra, helped her secure control over her late spouse's entire fortune. She dated Safra for some time, but the romance ended. Safra's family, who is of Sephardic Jewish descent, did not approve of his relationship with Lily, who was of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.\n\nIn 1972, Monteverde married businessman Samuel Bendahan, also a Sephardic Jew, and a man of more modest means. They separated after two weeks, and she divorced him after one year of marriage.\n\nIn 1976, Monteverde married Edmond Safra after all. The prominent banker was of Lebanese Jewish (Mizrahi) origin and a naturalized Brazilian citizen. He founded Republic National Bank of New York. The couple divided their time among homes in New York City, Monaco, Geneva, and the Villa Leopolda on the French Riviera.\n\nSafra was killed in Monaco in a fire that was determined to be arson. His death attracted considerable media interest because of his wealth and position. Edmond Safra \"apparently felt so safe here that he did not have his bodyguards stay the night when he slept in Monaco\".\n\nTed Maher, a former Green Beret who was Safra's bodyguard and nurse, was accused of starting the fire. His lawyer, Michael Griffith, has said that Maher started the fire in order to gain acceptance from Safra and that \"It was a stupid, most insane thing a human being could do. He did not intend to kill Mr. Safra. He just wanted Mr. Safra to appreciate him more. He loved Mr. Safra. This was the best job of his life.\" Maher was convicted and sentenced to eight years in jail. The case is considered controversial; even after his eight-year imprisonment, Maher has maintained his innocence.\n\nSafra left 50% of his assets to several charities, with the remainder divided among his family members and wife Lily, who received $800 million.\n\nLady Colin Campbell's novel \"Empress Bianca\" (2005) was considered to be a defamatory roman à clé by Safra's solicitor, Anthony Julius. Reacting to the legal threat in the United Kingdom, its publishers, Arcadia, withdrew the book and destroyed unsold copies. A revised edition of the book was later published in the United States.\n\nLily Safra supports numerous foundations, organizations, and charities. In 1977 she, her husband Edmond Safra, and Nina Weiner founded the International Sephardic Education Foundation. She chairs The Edmond J.

In October 2013, Safra donated $1 million in support of the foundation's grant-making programs. That same year, Safra contributed $16 million toward Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital in Tel Hashomer. She also donated $5 million toward the One Laptop Per Child project.\n\nShe established the Edmond J. Safra Family Lodge, for patients battling illnesses, as well as their families, at the National Institutes of Health near Washington DC. In July 2010, she donated 8 million euros to the Institute for Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries in Paris.\n\nIn the same year, she promised the Claude Pompidou Foundation a donation of 7 million euros for the construction and completion of the Claude Pompidou Institute for Alzheimer’s research and treatment in the city of Nice, France. The Institute was inaugurated and welcomed its first patients in 2014.\n\nSafra is a Patron of Hope and Homes for Children in the UK and a supporter of its work for children in Romania\n\nOn 3 February 2010 at an auction in London, Safra acquired \"L'Homme qui marche I\", a life-sized bronze sculpture by Alberto Giacometti of a man, for £65 million (US$104.3 million).

{"id": "2034774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034774", "title": "Green on Red", "text": "Green on Red\n\nGreen on Red was an American rock band, formed in the Tucson, Arizona punk scene, but based for most of its career in Los Angeles, California, where it was loosely associated with the Paisley Underground. Earlier records have the wide-screen psychedelic sound of first-wave desert rock, while later releases tended more towards traditional country rock.\n\nThe band began in 1979 as The Serfers, a four-piece made up of Dan Stuart (vocals/guitar), Jack Waterson (bass), Van Christian (drums, later of Naked Prey) and Sean Nagore (organ), quickly replaced by Chris Cacavas. In the summer of 1980, the Serfers relocated to Los Angeles, where they changed their name to Green on Red (after the title of one of their songs) to avoid confusion with the local surf punk scene. Christian returned to Tucson and was replaced by Lydia Lunch sideman Alex MacNicol.\n\nThe band issued an overtly psychedelic, self-released red vinyl EP, sometimes called \"Two Bibles\", though its first widely available record was an EP issued in 1982 by Dream Syndicate leader Steve Wynn on his own Down There label. Green on Red followed the Dream Syndicate onto Slash Records, which released the album \"Gravity Talks\" in the fall of 1983. San Francisco-based guitarist Chuck Prophet joined for the 1985 \"Gas Food Lodging\" (Enigma), after which MacNicol was replaced on drums by Keith Mitchell (later of Mazzy Star). In 2006 'Gas' was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series. Also in 1985, Stuart collaborated with Steve Wynn as \"Danny & Dusty\" on the album \"The Lost Weekend\" (A&M).\n\nA major-label deal with Phonogram/Mercury followed, with the 7-song EP \"No Free Lunch\" released in summer 1986. A strong country music direction was evident, which music critic Ira Robbins remarked \"should finally erase the group's original misassociation with the dreaded paisley underground\". The album \"The Killer Inside Me\" came next, produced by Jim Dickinson at Ardent Studios in Memphis. The band split up afterwards; Cacavas began recording albums under his own name. When Stuart returned to recording, with the 1989 \"Here Come the Snakes,\" it was essentially as a duo with Prophet, using hired backing including Christopher Holland on keyboards. Three more albums were released before the pair called it quits, after the 1992 \"Too Much Fun\".\n\nPost Green on Red, Stuart recorded the album \"Retronuevo\" with Al Perry in 1993, and solo effort \"Can O'Worms\" in 1995, and then essentially quit the music business; Prophet maintains a career as a solo artist and semi-celebrity sideman.\n\nHowever, in September 2005, the band reformed in its \"golden era\" line-up of Stuart, Cacavas, Prophet and Waterson, with Daren Hess filling in for Alex MacNicol (who had died in the meantime) to play a one-off show as part of the celebrations for the 20th anniversary of Club Congress in Tucson. This was followed up by a show in London on 10 January 2006 (ostensibly to complete their aborted 1987 European tour).\n\nIn 2007, Stuart and Wynn released their second studio album as Danny & Dusty, \"Cast Iron Soul\", which was released on Blue Rose Records. Danny & Dusty followed up in the same year with \"Here's to You Max Morlock—Live in Nuremberg\", a live double album and DVD.\n\nDan Stuart formed The Slummers in 2010, with JD Foster, Antonio Gramentieri, and Diego Sapignoli. They released their debut album Love of the Amateur and toured Europe a year later.\n\nIn 2012, Dan Stuart reemerged in Oaxaca de Juarez, Mexico, and released a new solo record, \"The Deliverance of Marlowe Billings\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Robin van Roon also joined them after a while. Both Greten and van Roon were best friends, and classmates of Jeroens' younger sister. Having produced some tracks on an old Amiga Computer with Protracker, the three went to visit DJ Paul Elstak, who had just started his label Rotterdam Records where they hoped to be contracted. However, Elstak considered their tracks to be 'pure noise'. Several months and several try-outs later, Elstak suddenly liked their tracks and decided to release them on his label.

The stadium is located in the city's east end near the interchange of Queensway and Vanier Parkway. It has been used for minor-league professional baseball and music concerts since 1993.\n\nThe stadium was built to house the Ottawa Lynx of the International League and opened prior to the 1993 season. In its first season, the Lynx sold out 43 games and set an International League attendance record by averaging 9,772 fans per game. However, annual attendance steadily declined from there, except for a modest increase in 2001. By 2006, Ottawa had the lowest average attendance in the league. The Lynx relocated after the 2007 season.\n\nAfter the departure of the Lynx, the City of Ottawa considered other proposals for the site but kept the stadium as a baseball facility for the following season. Among the proposals rejected by the city in 2007 were:\n\n\nA new team, the Ottawa Rapidz of the Can-Am League, was established in December 2007 and began to play in 2008. Despite attracting higher attendance than the Lynx in its final season, the Rapidz declared bankruptcy on September 29, 2009. A new team, the Voyageurs, was announced by the Can-Am league for the 2009 season. However, the league was faced with a lack of prospective owners for the team and with declining economic conditions and disbanded the Voyageurs in March 2009.\n\nThe stadium remained unused in 2009 except for a late-August series of community baseball games sponsored by Ottawa city councillor Bob Monette. Earlier, following the demise of the Voyageurs, Monette had suggested that the stadium be dismantled and the land sold to generate funds which could be applied to a new sports venue.\n\nIn August 2009, area businessmen Dave Butler and Duncan MacDonald presented a proposal which would renovate the existing stadium facility for activities throughout the year, including use as a venue for Winterlude.\n\nIn January 2010, the Intercounty Baseball League voted 6–2 in favour of presenting the Ottawa Stadium Group with an expansion franchise that would play at the Ottawa Baseball Stadium On March 10, 2010, the IBL confirmed that the application for an IBL expansion franchise had been accepted. The new team, the Ottawa Fat Cats, played from 2010 through 2012.\n\nAfter spending two years negotiating with various ownership groups to bring a double-A baseball franchise to Ottawa, including a prospective deal with Mandalay Baseball which required the city to invest $40 million in stadium renovations, the city signed a ten-year lease with the Can-Am League to field a team in 2015, named the Ottawa Champions, however the Can-Am League merged with the Frontier League after the 2019 season and the Champions were left off the 2020 Frontier League schedule, leaving the stadium again without a tenant.\n\nOttawa company JetForm first bought the naming rights to the Stadium. The name was changed to simply \"Lynx Stadium\" after the 2002 season when JetForm changed its name to Accelio. Accelio was in turn bought by Adobe Systems. For the 2008 season, the Rapidz marketed the stadium as \"Rapidz Stadium\".\n\nOn March 12, 2015, it was announced that accounting firm Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton had signed a multi-year naming rights deal, giving the park its current name.\n\nThe stadium is in the split-level design, with a concourse running around the middle of the seating bowl. This concourse is at street level, so fans in the \"lower\" seats walk down, and fans in the \"upper\" seats walk up. All seats are blue chair-back models. Concessions, restrooms, a gift shop, and a kids' play area are located along a wider concourse (also at street level) located underneath the upper seats.\n\nThe stadium also features skyboxes and the \"Upper Deck\" restaurant (No longer operational) perched behind home plate. The windows do not open, there is no outdoor seating at this level. Access is by elevator from the concourse below. This room is now labelled an event space, can be booked for parties of 50 plus. There are open-air picnic tables down the left-field line which are also available to all fans.\n\nCoventry Road runs along the left-field fence, and games can easily be seen from the street while driving or walking. There is less than of buffer between the stadium wall and the road, so flying balls can occasionally pose a hazard to passing cars.\n\nConcerts have been held at the stadium on rare occasions:\n\n\n"}

The mass, scored for four vocal soloists, choir and orchestra, was premiered that year by the Prince's musical forces in Eisenstadt. Beethoven performed parts of it in his 1808 concert featuring the premieres of four major works including his Fifth Symphony. The mass was published in 1812 by Breitkopf & Härtel.\n\nWhile the Prince who commissioned the mass was not pleased, the contemporary critic E. T. A. Hoffmann appreciated the \"expression of a childlike serene mind\", and Michael Moore notes the music's \"directness and an emotional content\".\n\nBeethoven had studied counterpoint in Vienna with Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, an authority in the field, but had not turned to sacred music until late in his career. He received a commission from Prince Nikolaus Esterházy II in 1807, extending a tradition established by Joseph Haydn, who for decades had served as the family's Kapellmeister (music director). Following his return from England in 1795, Haydn had composed one mass per year for the Esterházy family, to celebrate the name day of the Prince's wife. Haydn had ceased this tradition with the failure of his health in 1802. Beethoven was fully aware of the tradition that Haydn had established and it influenced him strongly in writing the Mass in C major. Beethoven confessed in a letter to the prince: \"may I just say that I will hand the mass over to you with great trepidation, as Your Serene Highness is accustomed to having the inimitable masterworks of the great Haydn performed.\" Lewis Lockwood writes:\n\nBeethoven's mass was premiered on 13 September 1807 by the Prince's own musical forces in Eisenstadt, the ancestral seat of the Esterházys not far from Vienna. It is not known what building housed the performance, but the two likely candidates are the Bergkirche, which had hosted a number of the Haydn premieres, and the chapel of the Prince's principal residence, Schloss Esterházy.\n\nThe first performance was underrehearsed; Stoltzfus describes the dress rehearsal as \"unsatisfactory\" and notes that only one of the five altos in the chorus was present.\n\nBeethoven conducted parts of the mass, the Gloria and the Sanctus, in a concert on 22 December 1808, which featured the public premieres of his Symphony No. 5, Symphony No. 6, Piano Concerto No. 4 and Choral Fantasy.\n\nBeethoven offered the mass, after revising the composition, to the publisher Breitkopf & Härtel, together with the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. Originally, the mass had been dedicated to Prince Esterházy; this dedication appears on the manuscript score used at the premiere. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the outcome of the first performance and the Prince's reaction, Beethoven dedicated the published version (1812) to another person, Prince Kinsky. The first publication consisted of a printed score with handwritten copies of orchestral parts on request.\n\nThe publisher sent Beethoven an alternative German text by , about which Beethoven commented on 16 January 1811: \"The translation of the Gloria seems to fit well to me, but to the Kyrie not so well, although the beginning “tief im Staub anbeten wir” [deep in dust we worship] fits very well; yet it seems to me in some expressions such as “ew’gen Weltenherrscher” [eternal ruler of the world] “Allgewaltigen” [omnipotent] are more suitable for the Gloria. The general character [...] in the Kyrie is heartfelt resignation, from where the depth of religious feelings “Gott erbarme dich unser” [God have mercy upon us] without, however, being sad, gentleness is the basis of the whole work, [...] although “eleison have mercy upon us” – yet there is cheerfulness in the whole. The Catholic goes to his church on Sundays bedecked with festive cheerfulness. The Kyrie Eleison is likewise the introduction to the whole mass; with such strong expressions little remains over for the places where they should really be strong.\"\n\nThe composition is scored for four soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir (SATB), and a symphony orchestra of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, timpani, strings and organ. The setting of the Latin Order of Mass is structured in five movements. In the following table of the movements, the voices, markings, keys and time signatures are taken from the score.\n\nThe premiere was not well received, particularly by the man who commissioned it, Prince Esterházy. Lewis Lockwood narrates the episode, reporting an anecdote told by the 19th century biographers Anton Schindler and Alexander Wheelock Thayer:\nAccording to the story, the prince, after hearing the work—and probably noticing its stark difference from the styles of Mass composition he revered in Haydn—said to Beethoven, \"But, my dear Beethoven, what is that you have done again?\" Whereupon, continues the story, the court chapel master was heard to laugh—this being none other than Johann Nepomuk Hummel, the composer and pianist who had himself written masses for the Esterházy court, including one in the same key, C major, just the previous year. Reacting angrily to the prince's question and furious over Hummel's pompous laughter as well as the inferior guest quarters he had been given in Eisenstadt, Beethoven left in a huff.\nCharles Rosen has called the episode Beethoven's \"most humiliating public failure\". The prince had perhaps muted his reactions in directly addressing Beethoven, as in a later letter to the Countess Henriette von Zielinska he went so far as to say, \"Beethoven's mass is unbearably ridiculous and detestable, and I am not convinced that it can ever be performed properly. I am angry and mortified.\"\n\nE. T. A. Hoffmann wrote in a review in 1813, expecting the power of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, about the \"expression of a childlike serene mind, which, relying on its purity, trusts in belief in God's mercy and pleads to him as to a father who wants the best for his children and fulfills their requests (\"den Ausdruck eines kindlich heiteren Gemüths, das, auf seine Reinheit bauend, gläubig der Gnade Gottes vertraut und zu ihm fleht wie zu dem Vater, der das Beste seiner Kinder will und ihre Bitten erhört)\". In the C minor Agnus Dei he heard \"a feeling of inner hurt which does not tear the heart but is good for it, and dissolves, like a sorrow from another world, to unearthly delight\" (\"ein Gefühl der inneren Wehmut, die aber das Herz nicht zerreisst, sondern ihm wohlthut, und sich, wie der Schmerz, der aus einer andern Welt gekommen ist, in überirdische Wonne auflöst\").\n\nToday, the mass is appreciated by critics (such as Rosen) but is probably one of the least performed of Beethoven's larger works. Michael Moore has written, \"While [it] is often overshadowed by the immense Missa Solemnis, written some fifteen years later, it has a directness and an emotional content that the latter work sometimes lacks.\" The \"Penguin Guide to Compact Discs\" (2004 edition) calls the work a \"long-underrated masterpiece.\"\n\n\n"}

His building of palaces, extravagant clothing, and taste for opera and other grand musical productions led to his being given the title \"the Magnificent\". He is remembered as the principal employer of the composer Joseph Haydn.\n\nNikolaus Esterházy was the son of Prince Joseph (József Simon Antal, 1688–1721), and the younger brother of Prince Paul Anton (Pál Antal, 1711–1762). He took the title of Prince on his brother's death.\n\nHis name is given in various languages: German (the language of the Habsburg Court) \"Nikolaus Josef\", Hungarian (probably his native language) \"Miklós József,\" and (in English contexts) the English form of his name, \"Nicholas\".\n\nIn early life he was educated by Jesuits. He became a military officer, serving the Austrian Empire. Of his military career, Robbins Landon notes that he achieved, \"considerable distinction, particularly as Colonel at the Battle of Kolin (1757) in the Seven Years' War where, with great personal courage, he led the wavering cavalry troops to victory. He was later made a Lieutenant Field-Marshal.\" Subsequently he became one of the original members of the Order of Maria Theresa. In 1762 he was appointed captain of Maria Theresa's Hungarian bodyguard, in 1764 \"Feldzeugmeister\", and in 1768 field marshal. His other honours included the Golden Fleece and the grade of commander in the Order of Maria Theresa.\n\nRobbins Landon narrates Nikolaus's marriage thus: \"On 4 March 1737, he married \"Freiin\" Marie Elisabeth, daughter of \"Reichsgraf\" (Count of the Holy Roman Empire) Ferdinand von Weissenwolf\". His son Anton I, Prince Esterházy became the father of Nikolaus II, Prince Esterházy, patron of well known musicians and composers.\n\nDuring the period before his brother Paul Anton's death, Nikolaus held the title of Count. He generally lived apart from his brother, favoring a hunting lodge near the Neusiedlersee in Hungary. The brothers got along well, however, at least as can be determined from their correspondence.\n\nUpon his brother's death in 1762, Paul Anton having had no children, Nikolaus inherited the title of Prince. Joseph II conferred the title of Prince, which had previously been limited to the eldest-born of the house, on all his descendants, male and female.\n\nIn 1766, Nikolaus began the construction of a magnificent new palace constructed at Eszterháza (now Fertőd), in rural Hungary on the site of his old hunting lodge. This is the most admired of the various Esterházy homes, is often called the \"Hungarian Versailles,\" and is a tourist attraction today. The Prince at first spent only summers there, but gradually came to spend ten months of the year—much to the distress of his musicians; see the tale of the \"Farewell\" Symphony. Nikolaus evidently did not enjoy Vienna (where most of the Empire's landed aristocrats spent much of their time) and the time he spent away from Eszterháza was mostly at the old family seat in Eisenstadt.\n\nNikolaus had a very high income; according to some sources, he was richer than the Austrian Emperor. However, his expenses were also high, and on his death his son and successor Anton (Antal, 1738–1794) was forced to retrench financially.\n\nNikolaus carried over habits he had acquired in the military to the administration of his household and lands. His chief administrator, Peter Ludwig von Rahier, was likewise a military man, and the highest ranking servants (including Joseph Haydn) were designated as \"house officers\" and ate at a special table provided for them.\n\nThe Prince insisted on honesty and exact adherence to procedure in his officials. At one point he issued \"a detailed printed document to his subordinates, containing all manner of ... instructions and advice ('locks on granaries must be subject to checks'; 'officials must be polite'; 'intoxication is the greatest vice'; 'the bee-hives are to be counted'; 'officials must lead God-fearing lives').\" In fact, his management style was successful, insofar as \"by the time of his death in 1790, he had greatly increased the wealth of the family estates.\"\n\nNikolaus was extravagant in his clothing budget, and wore a famous jacket studded with diamonds. He was also \"intensely musical\" (Robbins Landon and Jones, 35), and he played the cello, the viola da gamba, and his favourite instrument, the difficult and now-obscure baryton.\n\nGoethe, who beheld Nikolaus in Frankfurt on a diplomatic mission during the coronation of Joseph II in 1764, described him as 'not tall, though well-formed, lively, and at the same time eminently decorous, without pride or coldness.'\n\nNikolaus did not spend all of his income on himself; Karl Geiringer, in his biography of Haydn, documents a program of social welfare maintained by the Prince for his employees: \"Prince Nicolaus often showed himself to be generous and kindhearted and by and large displayed a degree of social-mindedness uncommon at that time. He paid pensions to aged employees, and bestowed small sums on their widows. He supported a modest hospital in Eisenstadt and another in Eszterháza, which were available to the court employees. The medicines dispensed by the monastery of the Brothers of the Order of Mercy were, in most cases, paid for by the Prince. Any employee was entitled to consult one of the three physicians attached to the court, and, if the doctor so advised, an ailing servant was sent at the sovereign's expense to a spa to receive treatment.\" \n\nNikolaus did not hire Haydn, but rather \"inherited\" him from his brother, who had hired him as Vice Kapellmeister in 1761. He was responsible for the promotion of Haydn to full Kapellmeister on the death of the old Kapellmeister, Gregor Werner, in 1766.\n\nIt is evident that, following a brief initial rough period (Haydn was reprimanded for negligence in 1765), the prince ultimately came to treasure Haydn. For instance, he frequently presented Haydn with gold ducats in praise of individual compositions, twice rebuilt Haydn's house when it burnt down (1768, 1776), and reversed a decision (1780) to dismiss the mediocre soprano Luigia Polzelli from the payroll when it became evident that Polzelli had become Haydn's mistress. Haydn was also allowed (1766) to retain another mediocre singer on the payroll, his younger brother Johann.\n\nThe official reprimand of 1765 included wording insisting that Haydn compose more works for the Prince's favorite instrument, the baryton. Haydn responded immediately, and in the period starting at this time and continuing into the mid-1770s wrote 126 baryton trios, as well as other works for the instrument. The baryton being quite obscure today, this music is not often played at present.\n\nIn his later life Nikolaus played much less and became something of a couch potato, listening to ceaseless performances of operas produced by Haydn and his troupe both for the main theatre and for the marionette theatre at Esterhaza. Haydn wrote several of these operas himself (see List of operas by Joseph Haydn). These are likewise among his least remembered works.\n\nThere is no sign that Nikolaus had any real interest in Haydn's string quartets, now considered among his greatest works. However, there is one area of Haydn's œuvre where Nikolaus can be uncontroversially considered a great patron of musical arts, as he was the primary sponsor of Haydn's series of symphonies. Of the 106 symphonies, those following the series written for Count Morzin (Haydn's first employer) and for Paul Anton, and before the Paris symphonies of the late 1780s, were written specifically at Nikolaus's instigation. They were premiered by a small orchestra that Nikolaus provided to Haydn, giving the composer ample rehearsal time, salary levels to attract top personnel, and full artistic control. Few composers can ever have claimed to have possessed such an incubator for their creations, and the symphonies that Haydn wrote for this ensemble can fairly be regarded as Nikolaus's gift to posterity.\n\nThe orchestra maintained by the Prince was much smaller than modern symphony orchestras; in the 1760s it numbered only about 13-15. Later, particularly with the introduction of opera performances, the orchestra was expanded, reaching a peak of about 22–24.\n\nA letter of Haydn's tells us that Nikolaus was disconsolate at the death (25 February 1790) of his wife, Princess Maria Elisabeth. The composer struggled to keep his employer's spirits up with music during the few months that he survived her. Haydn was touchingly loyal to his prince, but probably felt a certain sense of relief when Nikolaus finally died, on 28 September 1790.\n\n"}

At times, the tail seemed to split into up to six separate tails; at others, the tail appeared completely detached from the head of the comet.

She won in 2002.\n\nA native of the fictional island of San Cristobel, Olivia is the middle child of the late Gregory and Rebecca Spencer. The latter died of a stroke during an argument she was having with her daughter regarding her teenage pregnancy. She has and had two siblings: the eldest a sister, the late Marissa Spencer Randall, who was murdered by her husband, the late Alfred Randall, and her younger brother, Samuel Marcus \"Sam\" Spencer. She is also aunt to Alfred and Marissa's adopted son, Jonathan Randall, and thus great aunt to his daughter, Sarah Randall. Olivia received Gus Aitoro's (Ricky Paull Goldin) heart to survive when he was killed on April 1, 2008. Before she was hospitalized, she set up a wedding to marry Gus but he declined. She married Jeffrey so she wouldn't be alone.\n\nAs a result of teenage rape, she gave birth to a baby girl in 1986.

Through time and anguish, mother and daughter eventually forgave each other. Olivia also managed to forgive Jeffrey O’Neil for raping her, but not with ease. He apologized numerous times, and even said he would turn himself in. Ultimately, Jeffery did not have to do that. In time, all was forgiven. Jeffrey even agreed to marry her so she and her youngest daughter, Emma, would not be alone. Phillip Spaulding (Grant Aleksander) fathered Emma in 2003.

TSTT no longer holds a monopoly in fixed-line telephone services due to FLOW introducing a fixed-line service of their own, and their cellular monopoly was broken in June 2005 when licenses were granted to Digicel and Laqtel.\n\nThe first telephone was introduced in Trinidad and Tobago in 1883 and the first telephone exchange was located adjacent to the Town Hall (now City Hall) on Frederick Street. By 1898, the telephone system had developed sufficiently to justify enactment of the Telephone Communication Ordinance.\n\nAround 1890, the telephone service extended westward out of Port of Spain to Carenage and then onwards to one customer in Chaguaramas. In the early 1900s, the government operated telephone lines in rural areas, namely from Arima to Manzanilla and from San Fernando to Cedros. History records show that a Mr. Bell of Bacolet started the service in Tobago.\n\nThe early system consisted of local battery operated telephones connected to a magneto switchboard, a far cry from the sophisticated electronic system which is in operation today. Special cables called enamel cables were developed for use in this country, and it is reported that their use became worldwide because of their durability.\n\nThe British-owned Trinidad Consolidated Telephones Limited was responsible for the early developmental growth of the telephone network in Trinidad and Tobago from the mid-1930s until 1960.\n\nApproximately 6,300 lines were in service when the country got its first 1000-line step-by-step exchange in 1936. In 1947, Consolidated purchased the government-operated system in Tobago and the first teleprinter (TELEX) link was established in 1949.\n\nAfter a prolonged strike in 1960, which existed for 1,124 days, the government of the day purchased the company, and on November 30, Trinidad Consolidated Telephones Limited became the state owned Trinidad and Tobago Telephone Service.\n\nIn 1968, the Government entered into a partnership with Continental Telephone of the United States, to whom it sold fifty percent of the holdings. This was later dissolved in 1973 and the company returned to full ownership by the Government.\n\nOver the years, automatic step-by-step exchanges were gradually extended to suburban and urban areas as the company sought to keep pace with the development of the country. Development programmes were implemented in 1935, 1943, 1952 and 1964. A loan agreement was signed in 1974 with the World Bank for 18 million dollars to carry out a massive development programme. This resulted in the introduction of modern, electronic stored programme equipment at the exchanges.\n\nIn 1979, the government contracted Nippon Electric of Japan for the supply and installation of 48,000 additional lines and associated equipment.\n\nIn March 1981, some 8,000 subscribers were transferred to the new electronic exchange at Nelson. Similar ND 20 exchanges were commissioned at Thompson in San Fernando, Chaguanas, Couva, Piarco, San Juan, Diego Martin, Maraval, Arouca and St Augustine.\n\nThe major thrust of the company's development programme took place during the period 1982 to 1987.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1989, DMS-100 digital switches were installed throughout the country and, as a result of this new technology, training of employees became a significant factor. The new technology saw the introduction of new services such as international direct distance dialing and vertical services (call waiting, call forwarding and conference calling).\n\nThe company's operations were divided into the following divisions - Technical Operations, Marketing, Human Resources and Finance. The company's employee headcount was 2,300 (including contractors).\n\nThere were approximately 160,000 customers in four major operating districts.\n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago External Telecommunications Company Limited (TEXTEL), was incorporated as a limited liability company in December 1969 a joint venture participation, with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago holding 51% of the share capital and Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited, the other 49%.\n\nThe Company acquired the assets of Cable and Wireless in Trinidad and Tobago and assumed responsibility for external telecommunications, commencing 1 January 1970. As the legally constituted body charged with the responsibility for telecommunication links between the country and the rest of the world, TEXTEL provided the transmission, switching and signalling facilities to interconnect with the international facilities of all other countries.\n\nPrivate Branch Exchange Equipment (Avaya / MITEL / Cisco)\nDomestic and International Leased Circuits\nMetro Ethernet\nTrunk Lines, Direct Lines and Value Added Services (CLASS Services)\nInternet Services – leased line, blink broadband, blink on the Go, blink Hot Spot\nMobile Services – Mobile Handsets along with bMobile Corporate Plans\nBlackBerry – BES services, BIS services, BPS solutions, BlackBerry for Prepaid\nVideo Conferencing\nVC Cloud Services\nTelepresence\nSIP Trunks\nSecurity Services\n\nTSTT has re-branded its mobile division to bmobile along with other Cable and Wireless companies in the region. TSTT's mobile service currently uses the GSM network for data and voice. In 2007 they began launching data services on a CDMA network. Their previous TDMA network was discontinued on August 31, 2006.\n\nAs of 2006 competition has been introduced into its mobile market in Trinidad and Tobago. Digicel, which also serves other countries in the Caribbean, began operations on their GSM network in early 2006. Digicel and TSTT have since had legal battles over an inter-connection agreement to allow communication between their two networks. LAQTEL, a Trinidadian owned company, was also awarded a CDMA license but on March 14, 2008 had its license revoked.\n\nTSTT Internet Services include dial up service, wireless broadband service based on EVDO technology, and ADSL-based Broadband service. It's also the most expensive per Mbp/s in the country. TSTT also offers a variety of data solutions for the Corporate sector including leased circuits, virtual private networks, frame relay services, and metro Ethernet service with speeds up to 1GB. In October 2007, TSTT introduced its ADSL2+ broadband internet service branded \"Blink Broadband\" with speeds up to 10Mbit/s. However lagging behind their competitor, Columbus Communications, they still have a large portion of the market secured due to their previous copper network. Yet, to outdated technology and packages on their copper and fiber networks many people have flocked to the competitor. If these errors are not corrected, they are sure to fail. They have since sought refuge in the ever-expanding technology of LTE. Yet, they are making the same mistakes as before, throttling download and upload speeds next to nothing Mbit/s. This has gained them the upper hand in accessing markets blocked by topographical features. Many rural settlements have since been the main targets to obtain revenue. The service in question, has not lived up to expectations, which is mainly due poor performance attributed to the over-saturation of users and lack of available bandwidth.\n\nThe new packages include up to a maximum of 40Mbp/s download and 4Mbp/s upload only on their fiber network limited to certain areas. Their LTE network supports up to 5Mbp/s download and 1Mbp/s upload.\n\nIt's known to be the slowest but the most reliable on connectivity.\n\nThe following IPv4 and IPv6 address blocks has been assigned to TSTT by the Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre;\nTSTT is also in the process of rolling out its new TV service also branded as \"bmobile\" which is based on the IPTV technology.\nThe company is currently rolling out a wireless version of this service based on GSM technology.\n\nTSTT has entered the electronic surveillance market as well by launching their \"Blink Vigilance\" service with an optional add-on of armed response.\n"}

It was developed by Software Creations and published by Acclaim Entertainment, and is based on the animated television series \"The Simpsons\". The game is a parody of the fairy tale \"Jack and the Beanstalk\"; a large beanstalk grows far up into the sky outside the home of Bart Simpson, whom the player controls. Bart climbs the beanstalk all the way to the top and adventure ensues. \"Bart & the Beanstalk\" has received mixed to negative reviews from critics.\n\nThe game merges the existing universe of \"The Simpsons\" television series with the fairy tale of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". In the story, Bart Simpson goes to market to sell the family cow, but is swindled by a clever miser (played in the game by the character Mr. Burns) who trades it for magical beans and a slingshot. When Bart takes the magic beans home his father Homer Simpson accidentally eats them and spits them outside. A beanstalk grows, Bart climbs to the top, and adventures in a giant castle ensue. Bart meets several characters from \"The Simpsons\" on these adventures.\n\n\"The Simpsons: Bart & the Beanstalk\" is a side-scrolling platform game. It is single-player only. The player of the game controls Bart in a total of seven levels. They are: \"Up the Beanstalk\", \"Outside the Castle\", \"The Giant's Cupboard\", \"Soup Du Jour\", \"The Giant's Room\", \"Escape from the Castle\", and \"Down the Beanstalk\". In order to complete a level, the player must collect a certain amount of gold coins. Bart is faced with a number of enemies on every level, and he can use his slingshot to fend them off. He can also pick up dynamite, which kills all enemies currently on the screen. The enemies featured in the game include beetles, hornets, flies, ducks, rats, and fire flies. On some levels, Bart also has to defeat a boss.\n\nThe game was developed by Software Creations and published by Acclaim. Richard Kay and Michael Webb served as executive producers, and Joe Smith composed the music. It was released in North America in February 1994 for the hand-held console Game Boy, and in Japan on September 30, 1994. \"The Simpsons: Bart & the Beanstalk\" is one of several \"The Simpsons\" Game Boy games published by Acclaim in the beginning of the 1990s.\n\n\"Bart & the Beanstalk\" has received mixed to negative reviews from critics. In his 1994 book \"Video Games: A Guide for Savvy Parents\", David Sheff describes \"Bart & the Beanstalk\" as \"a frustratingly tough game without much whimsy.\" \"GamePro\" commented that \"this drab game definitely lacks personality. There's a challenge here for those who want to sit through yet another simple side-scroller. Everyone else, though, might be better off trading in their magic beans for a cow.\" Similarly, a review in \"Game Players\" said \"the designers of this action game took a standard story, plastered the \"Simpsons\" faces on boring characters, then threw in some of the show's running jokes. Bor-ring!\" The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" found the game's biggest problem to be that it is too frustratingly hard, especially for the game's pre-adolescent target audience. They also stated that the difficulty stems chiefly from the poor design of Bart's slingshot.\n\nJeff Kapalka of the \"Syracuse Herald-American\" was more positive, giving the game a three out of four rating in a review. He commented that \"the graphics are crisp, clear and cartoony, and it's a fun game for the Game Boy,\" and noted that the game is similar to the early side-scrolling Mario games. A review in the \"St. Petersburg Times\" called \"The Simpsons: Bart & the Beanstalk\" \"fun and funny\".\n\nIn 2009, 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey reviewed the game in 1UP's official Retro Gaming Blog. He described the game as annoying, but thought the graphics were good. Mackey wrote that \"outside of a funky walk cycle from Bart, the game actually looks pretty nice—for some reason the Game Boy \"Simpsons\" games were always graphically superior to the NES ones—but that's about all the praise it deserves. Even more so than \"Camp Deadly\", the screen of Beanstalk is awfully cramped, so the problem of enemies appearing out of nowhere to kill you has only gotten worse.\" Mackey added that he would have liked to see a more powerful weapon because the range of the slingshot is only a few feet.\n"}

The House now belongs to the London Borough of Hounslow and is open to visitors as a historic house museum free of charge. Chiswick is now one of London's western suburbs, but in the 18th century it was a large village or small town quite separate from the metropolis, but within easy reach of it. Today the house is a Grade I listed building.\n\nThe house was built between 1713 and 1717 in the corner of an orchard belonging to the Downes family. Its first occupant was Rev George Andreas Ruperti, the pastor of St Mary's Lutheran church in the Savoy, London, who used it as his country home. He cared for the thousands of refugees from the Rhineland who arrived in London following a famine in 1708-9. They hoped to be able to reach America - with Ruperti's help many did, and some settled in the south of Ireland. Ruperti's lists of the refugees, which record their trades, have been invaluable to family historians. He was appointed to the Lutheran Church at St James's Palace in 1728 at a salary of £200 a year. After his death in 1731 his widow retained the House; the Hogarths bought it from his son in 1749.\n\nAccording to the increased valuations in the parish rate books, the Hogarths extended it in 1750 and Mrs Hogarth added another single storey extension in 1769. It was the artist's country retreat from 1749 until his death in 1764; he had a \"painting room\" over his coach-house at the bottom of the garden. He shared it with his wife, mother-in-law, his wife's cousin, Mary Lewis (who assisted with his business) and his sister. His town house was in Leicester Square, and was demolished in 1870. William Hogarth is buried in the graveyard of the nearby St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick; his fine tomb-monument carries an obituary by his great friend, the actor David Garrick. The family's connections with the house continued until Mary Lewis' death in 1808.\n\nFrom 1814 to 1833 the house belonged to Rev Henry Francis Cary, a poet and skillful translator of Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". He came to Chiswick as Curate of St Nicholas' Church and went on to become Assistant Librarian at the British Museum. He was part of a circle of writers and poets, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge who promoted Cary's Dante translation and made it a best seller. The House was acquired in 1833 by the Wickstead family; they migrated to Australia in 1840 and left the house to tenants. In about 1867 it became home to Newton Treen Hicks (\"Brayvo Hicks\") a well-known melodramatic actor.\n\nAlfred Dawson, whose family home at The Cedars adjoined Hogarth's and whose printing works was nearby, rescued the House in 1890 and restored it. He leased it to a nursery gardener along with part of his own garden. However, he sold it in 1900 and it was put up for auction for re-development in 1901. A campaign by artists and writers failed to raise sufficient funds to buy the House but it was purchased by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert William Shipway, of Grove House, Chiswick. He restored it with the help of Frederick William Peel ARIBA and Henry Austin Dobson, Hogarth's biographer. He provided a collection of Hogarth's works, commissioned replica furniture based on pieces in Hogarth prints and even took the photographs for the first guide book himself. He opened it to visitors in 1904. Shipway gave the house to Middlesex County Council in 1909 and ownership passed to Hounslow Council when Middlesex was abolished in 1965.\n\nThe house was damaged in September 1940 as a result of a parachute mine explosion nearby during World War II. It was repaired and re-opened in 1951. At that time the single-storey extension was completely rebuilt to provide a small exhibition room. The interior of the House was refurbished for the Hogarth Tercentenary in 1997.\n\nIn 2014 the William Hogarth Trust commissioned a special exhibition to be held at the museum to mark the 250th anniversary of Hogarth's death. This exhibition featured artwork submissions from over fifty artists and celebrities in tribute to Hogarth including works by Quentin Blake, Harry Hill, Jacqueline Wilson, Cath Kidston, Peter Blake (artist) and Joanna Lumley.\n\nThe house closed for refurbishment in September 2008. On 14 August 2009, there was a fire in the house, which was empty. No furnishings or prints were lost, but the staircase and one room were badly damaged and other areas suffered from smoke damage and the effects of the water which doused the flames. The entire structure was carefully restored and a major research project carried out on the history of the House and its occupants. A paint analysis informed the re-decoration, and original features were repaired and revealed, including window shutters, fire surrounds and hearths, and two areas of original floorboards.\n\nThe Heritage Lottery Fund, the John & Ruth Howard Charitable Trust and the William Hogarth Trust supported the London Borough of Hounslow in this project with grants and expert advice. Negotiations over insurance and the requirement for complete rewiring, as well as structural repairs, delayed the re-opening.\n\nThe museum was officially re-opened on 8 November 2011 by Dara Ó Briain. Two floors of the house are open to visitors and the top floor houses a study/research room for use by appointment. The furnishing includes Shipway's replica pieces and new displays presents the House as a home, as well as celebrating Hogarth's life and work. Prints of some of his best known engravings are also on display, including the series \"A Harlot's Progress\", \"A Rake's Progress\" and \"Marriage à-la-mode\". \n\nThe House has an attractive walled garden which contains a mulberry tree. This is probably the last survivor of the original orchard established in the 1670s. It was damaged by the parachute mine and brought back to good health by arboriculturists from Kew Gardens.\n\n"}
{"id": "2034884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034884", "title": "Cherchell", "text": "Cherchell\n\nCherchell (Arabic: شرشال Berber: ⵛⴻⵔⵛⴻⵍ) is a town on Algeria's Mediterranean coast, west of Algiers. It is the seat of Cherchell District in Tipaza Province. Under the names Iol and Caesarea, it was formerly a Phoenician, Carthaginian, and Roman colony and the capital of the kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania.\n\nThe town was originally known by a Phoenician and Punic name that included the element (), meaning \"island\". The Punic name was hellenized as \"Iṑl\" () and Latinized as Iol. In the Berber languages and Tifinagh alphabet, the city is named ⵛⴻⵔⵛⴻⵍ.\n\nCherchel and Cherchell are French transcriptions of the Arabic name Shershel (), derived from the town's old Latin name Caesarea (, \"hē Kaisáreia\"), which was given to it in 25 by to honor his benefactor Augustus, who had legally borne the name \"Gaius Julius Caesar\" after his posthumous adoption by Julius Caesar in 44. It was later distinguished from the many other Roman towns named Caesarea by calling it , (\"Mauretania's Caesarea\"), (, \"Iṑl Kaisáreia\"), or . After its notional refounding as a Roman colony, it was formally named after its imperial patron Claudius.\n\nPhoenicians established their first major wave of colonies on the coasts between their homeland and the Strait of Gibraltar in the 8th century, but Iol was probably established around 600 and the oldest remains so far discovered at Cherchell date from the 5th century. By that time, Carthage had already taken control of the Phoenicians in the western Mediterranean. Punic Iol was one of the more important trading posts in what is now Algeria. In the 3rd century, it was fortified and began issuing Numidia's first coins in bronze and silver, bearing Punic text, Carthaginian gods, and images of local produce, particularly fish.\n\nAfter the Punic Wars, Carthage's holdings in northwest Africa were mostly given to Rome's local allies. Iol was given to Micipsa, the king of Numidia, who first established it as a royal court. It became an important city for the kingdom and was the primary capital for and II. The town minted its own coins and received new defensive works in the 1st century. Its Punic culture continued, but worship of Baal Hammon was notionally substituted with worship of his Roman equivalent Saturn.\n\nIol was annexed directly to Rome in 33. Augustus established as king of Mauretania in 25, giving him the city as his capital, which Juba then renamed in his honor. Juba and his wife Cleopatra (the daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra of Egypt) rebuilt the city on a lavish scale, combining Roman and Hellenized Egyptian styles. The roads were relaid on a grid and amenities included a theater, an art gallery, and a lighthouse modeled after the Pharos in Alexandria. He probably began the Roman wall that ran for about around a space of about ; about 150 of that total was used for the settlement in antiquity. The royal couple were buried in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania. The seaport capital and its kingdom flourished during this period, with most of the population being of Greek and Phoenician origin with a minority of Berbers.\n\nTheir son Ptolemy was assassinated by Caligula during a trip to Rome in 40. Rome proclaimed the annexation of Mauretania, which was resisted by Ptolemy's former slave Aedemon and by Berber leaders such as Sabalus. Caligula himself was murdered before Rome's response could be made, but his successor Claudius sent legions under Gn. Hosidius Geta and G. Suetonius Paulinus to complete the conquest. By 44, most resistance had been ended and the former kingdom was divided into two Roman provinces, one governed from Tingis (present-day Tangiers) and another governed from Caesarea. Mauretania Caesariensis extended along what is now the Algerian coast and included most of the hinterland as far as the Atlas Mountains.\n\nRoman colonies of veteran soldiers were established in the new provinces to maintain order. Caesarea itself was made a colony, with its residents gaining Roman citizenship. It prospered as a provincial capital during the 1st and 2nd centuries, reaching a population of over 20,000 and possibly as many as 30,000. It was defended by auxiliary units and was the harbor of Rome's Mauretanian Fleet, which was established as a permanent force after Berber raids in the early 170s. The city featured a hippodrome, amphitheater, numerous temples, and civic buildings like a basilica. It was surrounded by suburban villas whose agricultural mosaics are now celebrated. It had its own school of philosophy, academy, and library. It received a new forum and further patronage from the African emperor Septimius Severus and his dynasty, possibly reaching as many as 100,000 inhabitants. Its native son Macrinus and his son Diadumenian became the first Berber and lower-class emperors, reigning in 217 and 218. (Their predecessor's wastefulness and wars required unpopular financial adjustments that led to their overthrow in favor of Elagabalus.) Juba's theater was converted into an amphitheater sometime after the year 300.\n\nThe city was sacked by a Berber revolt in 371 and 372. It largely recovered, but was ravaged again by the Vandals after they were invited into Roman North Africa by Count Boniface in 429. Parts of the town received new fortifications. After the Vandal Kingdom conquered Carthage in 439, they also acquired a large part of Rome's Mediterranean fleet which they used to carry out raids all over the sea. Caesarea's port was sometimes used as a base for these raiders, and the city prospered from their plunder. Its schools produced the famous grammarian Priscian, who emigrated to the Byzantine east.\n\nIn 533, the Vandal Kingdom was conquered by Byzantine forces under Justinian's general Belisarius. Caesarea was among the areas to return to imperial rule. It was the seat of Mauretania's duke (), but it went into decline and its city center was given over to ramshackle housing for the poor. The first duke was named John; that he was given an infantry unit rather than cavalry implies that he was meant to hold the port without much concern about controlling its surrounding hinterland.\n\nThe town remained under Byzantine control until its Muslim conquest in the late 7th century. Successive waves of Umayyad attacks into Byzantine North African territory over 15 years wore down the smaller and less motivated imperial forces, until finally Umayyad troops laid siege to the city of Caesarea and, although the defenders were resupplied by Byzantine fleets, finally overwhelmed it. Much of the Byzantine nobility and officials fled to other parts of the Empire, while most of the remaining Roman and semi-Roman Berber population accepted Islamic rule which granted them protected status.\n\nSome remained Christians. For two generations what remained of the Roman population and Romanized Berbers launched several revolts often in conjunction with reinforcements from the Empire. As a result, by the ninth century down much of the city's defences were damaged beyond repair, and resulting in its political loss of importance, leaving the former city little more than a small village.\n\nFor the following few centuries, the city remained a power center of Arabs and Berbers with a small but significant population of Christians who were fully assimilated by the beginning of the Early Modern period. Similarly, by the 10th century the city's name had transformed in the local dialect from a Latin to a Berber and ultimately into the Arabised form \"Sharshal\" (in French orthography, Cherchell).\n\nDuring the later Middle Ages, several attempts at reconquest were made by Europeans, who managed to hold the city off and on for a few generations. Notable of these in providing material for historical review, especially of what remained of its Roman and Byzantine infrastructure and population was the Norman Kingdom of Africa.\n\nEventually, Ottoman Turks managed to successfully reconquer the city from Spanish occupation in the 16th century, using the city primarily as a fortified port. In 1520, Hayreddin Barbarossa captured the town and annexed the Algerian Pashalic. His elder brother Oruç Reis built a fort over the town. Under Turkish occupation, the city's importance as a port and fort led to it being inhabited by Moslems of many nationalities, some engaging in privateering and piracy on the Mediterranean.\n\nIn reply, European navies and especially the French Navy and the Knights Hospitaller (self-proclaimed descendants of the Crusaders) laid siege to the city and occasionally captured it for limited periods of time. For a century in the 1600s and for a brief period in the 1700s the city either was under Spanish or Hospitallar control. During this period a number of palaces were built, but the overwhelming edifice of Hayreddin Barbarossa's citadel, was considered too militarily valuable to destroy and uncover the previous ancient buildings of old Caesarea.\n\nIn turn, many ancient statues and buildings were either restored and left in Cherchell, or taken to museums in Algiers, Algeria or Paris, France for further study. However, not all building projects were successful in uncovering and restoring the ancient town. The Roman amphitheatre was considered mostly unsalvageable and unnecessary to rebuilt. Its dress stones were used to the build a new French fort and barracks. Materials from the Hippodrome were used to build a new church. The steps of the Hippodrome were partly destroyed by Cardinal Charles Lavigerie in a search for the tomb of Saint Marciana.\n\nFrench occupation also brought new European settlement, to join the city's long-established communities of semi-Arabized Christians of local origin and old European merchant families, in addition to Berbers and Arab Muslims. Under French rule, European and Christians became a majority of the population again until World War II.\n\nIn the immediate years before World War II, losses to the French national population from World War I, and a declining birthrate in general among Europeans kept further colonial settlement to a trickle. Arab and Berber populations started seeing an increase in growth. French-Algerian colonial officials and landowners encouraged larger numbers of surrounding Berber tribesmen to move into the surrounding region to work the farms and groves cheaply. In turn, more and more Berbers and Arabs moved into the city seeking employment. By 1930 the combined Berbo-Arab Algerian population represented nearly 40% of the city's population.\n\nThe changing demographics within the city were disguised by the large numbers of French military personnel based there and the numbers of European tourists visiting what had become known as the Algerian Riviera. Additionally, during World War II, Cherchell, with its libraries, cafes, restaurants, and hotels served as a base for the United States Army and Allied War effort, hosting a summit conference between the US and UK in October 1942.\n\nThe end of the war with its departure of Allied forces and a reduction of French naval personnel due to rebasing saw an actual decline in Europeans living in the city. Additionally, the general austerity of the post-war years dried up the tourism industry and caused financial stagnation and losses to the local Franco-Algerian community. In 1952, a census recorded that the Frenco-Algerian population had declined to 50% of the population.\n\nFor the remaining 1950's Cherchell was only slightly caught up by the Algerian War of Independence. With its large proportion of Europeans, French control and influence was strong enough to discourage all but the most daring attacks by anti-French insurgents. By 1966, after independence from the French, Cherchell had lost nearly half of its population and all of its Franco-Algerian population.\n\nCherchell has continued to grow post-independence, recovering to peak colonial-era population by the 1980s. Cherchell currently has industries in marble, plaster quarries and iron mines. The town trades in oils, tobacco and earthenware. Additionally, the ancient cistern first developed by Juba and Cleopatra Selene II was restored and expanded under recent French rule and still supplies water to the town.\n\nAlthough the Algerian Riviera ended with the war, Cherchell is still a popular tourist places in Algeria. Cherchell has various splendid temples and monuments from the Punic, Numidian and Roman periods, and the works of art found there, including statues of Neptune and Venus, are now in the Museum of Antiquities in Algiers. The former Roman port is no longer in commercial use and has been partly filled by alluvial deposits and has been affected by earthquakes. The former local mosque of the Hundred Columns contains 89 columns of diorite. This remarkable building now serves as a hospital. The local museum displays some of the finest ancient Greek and Roman antiquities found in Africa. Cherchell is the birthplace of writer and movie director Assia Djebar.\n\nEarthquakes, wars and plunder have ravaged many of the ancient remains.\n\nSome remains can be seen in the local Archeological Museum of Chercell-Caesarea.\n\nChristianity arrived in Caesarea early enough to produce martyrs during the Diocletianic Persecution. For vandalizing an idol of Diana, StMarciana was supposedly tortured and killed in Caesarea's arena, gored by a bull and mauled by a leopard for the amusement of the crowd. StTheodota and her sons were also supposedly martyred in the city.\n\nCaesarea was a bishopric from about 314 to 484, although not all of its bishops are known. Fortunatus took part in the 314 Council of Arles, which condemned Donatism. Clemens was mentioned in one of Symmachus's letters and would have served in the 370s. During the 411 synod at Carthage, Caesarea was represented by the Donatist Emeritus and the orthodox Deuterius. StAugustine accosted Emeritus at Caesarea in the autumn of 418 and secured his exile. Apocorius was an orthodox bishop whom Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484 and then exiled. An early 8th-century \"Notitia Episcopatuum\" still included this see.\n\nCaesarea was revived by the Roman Catholic Church as a titular see in the 19th century. It was distinguished as \"Caesarea in Mauretania\" in 1933. Its bishops have included:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The forerunner of Head-Royce was the Anna Head School for Girls in Berkeley, founded in 1887. Relocated to its current site in 1964, Anna Head School for Girls merged with the neighboring Royce School in 1979 to form the present-day Head-Royce School.\n\nHead-Royce is composed of three divisions. The Lower School consists of kindergarten through 5th grade. The Middle School is composed of the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. Finally, the Upper School encompasses 9th through 12th grades. Most new students enter Head-Royce in kindergarten, 6th grade, or 9th grade.\n\nThe school was founded in 1887 by Anna Head as the Anna Head School for Girls in Berkeley, California. \n\nIn 1955, the University of California, Berkeley acquired the school's property by writ of eminent domain. The school was relocated to the Oakland Hills, and a new campus was constructed by 1964.\n\nIn 1971, the school's Board of Trustees established a co-ordinate school for boys, The Royce School, named in honor of philosopher (and Anna Head's brother-in-law), Josiah Royce. In 1979, the schools completed the transition to become a fully co-educational school, with its current name.\n\nNearly one half of the students and one third of the employees are people of color. One quarter of the student body receives financial assistance.\n\nEvaluation for acceptance depends upon the division to which the applicant wishes to be admitted. The admissions process for the high school is generally composed of testing through a proprietary test or an independent school Entrance Exam (ISEE), transcript and relevant history, recommendations, and an interview; in addition, a student evaluation may influence the final decision. Head-Royce claims a selective admissions rate that is competitive with many American colleges.\n\nTuition for previous school years (USD):\nHead-Royce participates in the National Association of Independent Schools' School and Student Service for Financial Aid. In 2014, $4,000,000 worth of need-based grants was provided to K-12 students.\n\nHead-Royce students complete a college-preparatory curriculum including mandatory courses in English; mathematics; American history; European history; physics; chemistry; biology; foreign language; fine arts; and physical education, as well as a rotating group of elective courses in science, English and history in the senior year. These senior elective courses have covered such topics as astronomy, robotics, Shakespeare, Japanese literature, psychology, the history of Islam, and many others. Some courses specifically prepare students for Advanced Placement exams in the subject. The vast majority of students take at least three AP exams by the end of high school, with many students opting to take six or more exams.\n\nAdditional graduation requirements include completion of a prescribed amount of approved community service activity, and completion of a \"senior project\" in lieu of final exams at the end of the senior year, involving logging 80 hours toward a specific endeavor of the student's choosing.\n\nGraduating-class sizes are generally 85–95 students. The school has a 100 percent (in some years nearly 100 percent) matriculation rate to four-year colleges, especially University of California schools and elite private institutions.\n\nThe 77 students in the class of 2006 had average SAT scores of 674 Critical Reading, 676 Math and 673 Writing.\nThis class contained 15 National Merit commended students, 17 National Merit semi-finalists, 15 finalists and 3 National Merit Scholarship winners.\n\nThe school newspaper is \"The Hawk's Eye\", which publishes monthly.\n\nThe Head-Royce campus was built in a ravine adjacent to Lincoln Avenue in Oakland. The current campus consists of three distinct areas, coinciding with the three \"divisions.\"\n\nThe Lower School is in the lowest and most western part of the ravine and has two buildings: the \"Rotunda\" which contains the kindergarten and first grade classrooms as well as the art room, and the \"Lower School Building\" which contains the classrooms for 2nd through 5th grade. This is also the location of the after school program, lower school library, and computer lab. The lower school also has a vegetable garden, a courtyard, a large play structure known as the \"Big Toy\" (although the \"Big Toy\" brand is no longer used) and a basketball court (also known as the \"Blue Courts\").\n\nThe middle school building is farther east and uphill. The main gathering area for the middle school is a large patio which is just below the administrative offices and overlooks the swimming pool. The main floor of the building houses 7th and 8th grade classrooms, the “Community Room” (which is also used for the school's choir groups), as well as the Mary E. Wilson Auditorium (commonly referred to as \"MEW\"). The MEW hosts weekly afternoon meetings, assemblies, performances, and special events. The main level also contains a kitchen that serves as a cafe for breakfast and lunch, staffed by the Epicurean Group, and a lounge room that serves as a lunchroom for faculty as well as a meeting room. The 6th classrooms are located on the lower level along with both vocal and instrumental music rooms. This level shares a courtyard with the lower school.\n\nThe fine arts studios are located on the other side of the MEW and include a computer lab for digital imaging and video production, a ceramics studio, the instrumental music room, and a drama room. On the upper level of these rooms are the 3D and 2D art studios and an art gallery.\n\nNext to the fine arts classrooms and parallel to Lincoln Avenue is the World Languages Building, a two-level building dedicated to the middle and upper school language classes (Latin, French, Spanish, and Mandarin). This building was completed in 2008 as one of the changes of the \"Master Plan\", Head-Royce's plan for renovation and reconstruction.\n\nThe World Languages Building is one of three new buildings built around the main courtyard of the upper school. The other two buildings are the Read Library and the main upper school building, which is perpendicular to Lincoln Avenue and has three levels. The bottom level houses the Jayhawk Café, run by the Epicurean Group. The faculty room, student-faculty lounge, computer lab, and upper school office are adjacent to the café. The second and third levels have most of the English, history, math, and science classrooms, including two biology labs and two chemistry labs.\n\nThe building parallel to the main upper school building houses additional math, history, language, and science (specifically physics) classrooms. It is commonly referred to as \"the old middle school\" because the middle school and high school switched places at the start of the 2008–2009 school year. This building is connected to the Paul Chapman Pavilion (the gym) which includes a weight room. Further east of the gym is the outdoor basketball court, the tennis courts, the athletics field, and the parking lot.\n\nIn 2013, the school acquired eight acres on the south side of Lincoln from the Lincoln Child Center. In December 2018, the school submitted an application for a new master plan for a campus on both sides of Lincoln Avenue with an underground link between the two properties.\n\nHead-Royce's mascot is a Jayhawk named Tuffy. The high school competes as a member of the Bay Counties League - East (BCL East). The middle school competes as a member of the Bay Area Interscholastic Athletic League (BAIAL). Its rival is The College Preparatory School, commonly known as 'CPS'.\n\nAthletic facilities on campus include the Paul Chapman Pavilion (commonly referred to as \"the gym\") for basketball and volleyball, three tennis courts (each named), and the Farley Field with the Jesse Becherer Diamond for soccer, baseball, softball, and lacrosse. Head-Royce also has several small practice basketball courts spread around campus. A new drainage system was installed underneath the field in the winter of 2005–2006 to prevent mud patches which had become a problem. The school has also installed a running path on a hill above the field which can be used for recreational running. A swimming pool is on campus for lower school swim lessons, PE classes, and the swim team, but it is not of regulation size and therefore does not host many meets. The golf team plays at Lake Chabot Golf Course, which is near the school. No plans to improve the athletic facilities have so far been revealed in the master plan.\n\nIn the 2005–2006 school year, the middle school varsity boys teams (high school class of 2010) went undefeated and won the championship in all three of their sports (soccer, basketball, and baseball). This is the first time in league history that the same school has won all three championships \"and\" gone undefeated in the three sports.\n\nThe high school men's varsity basketball team and women's varsity soccer team have won the BCL championship six years in a row. In the 2006 season, the women's varsity volleyball team won the BCL championship. The men's varsity soccer program has been extremely successful with multiple BCL championships and two NCS Championship appearances in the last 4 years. The men's varsity volleyball program were BCL champions in 2006 and 2007 and came in second in NCS in 2006. In 2009, the men's varsity baseball program won the NCS Championship. In 2010 the men's varsity soccer, basketball, and tennis programs all won the BCL championship. The 2012–2013 women's varsity soccer team made history by advancing all the way to the NCS Championship game.\n\nIn 2016, the women's varsity volleyball team won the CIF State Division V championship, the first statewide team championship in the school's history.\n\nIn 2017, the men's varsity soccer team won the North Coast Sectional (NCS) Division 2 title vs. Making Waves Academy by a score of 2-1. It was the first men's varsity soccer title win in school history. The Jayhawks ended the season 18-1, and ranked as the top men's team in the state of California for the fall soccer season .\n\n\n\n"}

De Zela was supported by a large group of criollos, mestizos and Indians, among them the caciques José Rosa Ara and Miguel Copaja.\n\nThe rebellion of Tacna was in close contact with the Argentine revolution, initiated in Buenos Aires on May 25, 1810. The Argentines sent an army to the Charcas region (Bolivia), under the command of general Antonio González de Balcarce and the lawyer Juan José Castelli. They sent proclamations to various towns in southern Peru, inviting them to follow them in the revolution. The town of Tacna was the first under the direction of Don Francisco Antonio De Zela, occupying the quarters of the Spanish authorities that night.\n\nOn the same day (June 20) the Argentine army was defeated by Spanish forces in the Battle of Huaqui, bordering Lake Titicaca, and thus De Zela never received the needed support. This news created a morale problem for the De Zela's troops and as a result, they were defeated by the Spaniards. The main leaders of the rebellion were caught, among them De Zela, and they were led to Lima and condemned to 10 years in the military prison of Chagres, Panama, where De Zela died.\n\nHis house, located on Zela Street #542, was named a Historical Monument on July 26, 1961 and to this day continues to be one of the major tourist attractions of the city of Tacna.\n\nJune 20 is a local holiday in city of Tacna.\n\n"}

Anybody who wants to be a panzer can easily buy a kit that is currently mass-produced. As a result, one in ten people is a panzer. Doris Rurido is one of those panzers.\n\nThirteen-year-old Doris comes from a family that owns an advertising firm and has lived a very utopic lifestyle, even regarding herself as a princess. But when she attends the all-girls which is known for its Panzer League, she not only faces very new things as a typical rich girl such as junk food, the lack of servants, and studying in school, but also faces challenges as a panzer, especially her inexperience and small stature.\n\nTo help Doris advance as a panzer, her sister Doria came over and gave her training sessions that to Doris were \"very mean\". During a break in training, Doris was challenged by a panzer known as \"Raging Beetle\", who uses a pair of large hedge trimmers as weapons.\n\nA panzer fight consists of two thirty-minute rounds, each with a field giving an advantage to one of the two contending panzers. The panzer that knocks out the other wins. A panzer can also win on points.\n\nTheir first encounter was a disaster as Doris, billed as \"Drill Princess\", was overwhelmingly routed by Raging Beetle. Due to her loss, Doris was being mocked by other students. Not taking the stares any longer, she demanded a \"revenge match\" against Raging Beetle. The rematch was set and Doris won on that return match.\n\nDoris then faced a fighter dubbed \"Tornado Motor\", who uses a vacuum cleaner as a weapon of choice. Despite an injured hand from trying to open and close a hard-to-turn faucet, Doris not only managed to drive her drill through solid steel, but also managed to transform into a sexier and more powerful fighter without her awareness, winning the fight in the process.\n\nThinking that she was strong enough to face her dream opponent, Nejiru Gaou, Doris confronted her and verbally gave her challenge to fight her—one that Nejiru accepted. Despite Doria's best efforts to stop it (knowing that Doris was not yet worthy to face Nejiru), the match was set anyway. Doris's progress as a panzer and Nejiru's rustiness after a long absence figured in that bout, which ended on a draw based on points.\n\nNejiru was fatally injured while she and Doris were rescuing some construction workers from a collapsing structure using their powers as panzers. Knowing she failed to rescue Nejiru, Doris was overcome with guilt and grief as she is the only person outside the Gaou family to remember Nejiru. But she found enough courage and some solace from Nejiru's little sister Nejiri to continue her quest to be a good panzer.\n\n"}

Of the 26 championships (team category) held thus far, 14 have been won by the United States, 7 by Germany, 3 by the Czech Republic, and 2 by Japan. The most successful individual contestant is Ulrich Voigt (Germany) with 11 titles since 2000.\n\nThe latest WPC was held in October 2019 in Germany.\n\nThe World Puzzle Championship was the brainchild of Will Shortz, who wanted to create an event where puzzlers from different countries could compete on an even playing field. Previously, the International Crossword Marathon was the major international competition for puzzle-solving, and Shortz had attended it every year, but because participants used their own language and crossword rules, it was not a very good basis for comparing raw puzzle-solving skills across cultures. Shortz created the WPC to overcome these flaws. As described by Nick Baxter, co-director of the U.S. Puzzle Championship, the challenge of the competition is speed.\n\nThe first WPC was held in New York City in 1992, and Shortz was the organizer and Helene Hovanec was the coordinator. Each WPC has been held at a different city since then.\n\nCurrently, 34 countries are official members of the World Puzzle Federation. Individuals may also take part if their country is not already represented by a national team. In the 2017 WPC, 169 contestants from 27 countries participated. The United States has won the championship 14 times, followed by Germany with 7 championships. The Czech Republic has won three times and Japan has won twice.

The cast members of \"The Simpsons\" provided their voices for the program. \"The Simpsons Cartoon Studio\" has received generally positive reviews, although there has been some criticism too.\n\n\"The Simpsons Cartoon Studio\" is a design program for creating cartoons using characters, sounds, music, and locations from the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\". To create a cartoon, one first selects a background, then inserts characters, props, and special effects, and after that adds dialog, sound effects, and music. The program allows users to send the finished cartoons to friends through email or save it onto a hard drive or a floppy disk.\nThere are 17 characters, 50 special effects, 270 props, and 35 backgrounds in \"The Simpsons Cartoon Studio\", with thousands of individual cels hand-drawn by actual \"The Simpsons\" cartoonists. Every character has a set of actions; for example, Homer can crawl, ride on a tube, and run away screaming, while Bart can run, trip over, cycle, ride his skateboard, and paint graffiti with spray-paint. Backgrounds featured range from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant to Bart's room, and props include tables, blenders, and the three-eyed fish Blinky.\n\n\"The Simpsons Cartoon Studio\" was released for PC and Mac computers in the middle of 1996.

The dialogs featured in the program were provided by the actual cast members of \"The Simpsons\".\n\nCritics gave \"The Simpsons Cartoon Studio\" generally favorable reviews, and it received a lot of hype in the United States around the time it was released. A reviewer for \"The Palm Beach Post\" wrote that it is not very easy to create the cartoons: \"Layering characters, props, sound effects and dialogue into seamless animation is no small task, and you'll invest a good chunk of time with this CD-ROM before you're ready to premiere your own \"Simpsons\" episodes. But if you're fan enough to go the distance, this is a remarkably versatile program that turns out great-looking cartoons.\" Similarly, Jane Clifford of \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" called it \"quite a challenging product\" which produces cartoons that \"really look professional.\" Benjamin Svetkey of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave it a B+ rating, commenting that the cartoons created \"can be entertaining, but they're hampered by a failing common to the make-your-own-movie genre: Since \"Cartoon Studio\" has a limited number of voice clips ('Ay, caramba!', 'Mmm... donuts', and about 50 variations on 'Bart!'), your plot choices are restricted to the usual pranks, pratfalls, and catchphrases. Still, as Homer would say, \"The Simpsons Cartoon Studio\" is more 'Woohoo!' than 'D'oh!'.\"\n\n\"Wired\"s Erika Milvy commented that \"Fox's \"Simpsons Cartoon Studio\" may be more the '90s answer to Colorforms than a finely tuned animation resource, but dang if it isn't fun to watch Smithers and Mr. Burns hula across the monitor as a three-eyed fish swims by,\" and added that \"for the anally inclined, there's certainly a way to have these cartoons make more sense. But I prefer to toss rhyme and reason out the window.\" Joseph Szadkowski of \"The Washington Times\" wrote that \"For the amount of complicated computer stuff going on — frame by frame editing, character motion, voice overlays — even the most computer-illiterate individual should be able to figure this out. \"The Simpsons Cartoon Studio\" is a very fun, relatively inexpensive jaunt into the mind of Mr. Groening.\"\n\nMike Langberg of Knight Ridder was less positive, writing in his review that \"At first glance, the CD-ROM provides a lot of raw material. There are 350 brief animations, running two or three seconds each, showing 17 characters from the show in numerous poses. The CD-ROM delivery, unfortunately, falls flat[...].\" He explained that \"\"Simpsons Cartoon Studio\" is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect the rest of us will do any better.\" Similarly, Nancy Malitz of \"The Detroit News\" wrote that \"you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so things look sort of choppy no matter how hard you try.\"\n"}

To fully do so, the player must unlock hidden areas by obtaining secret items. A map of the town is featured that gives instructions to players on where to go so that they can progress through the game. Various minigames can be played at certain locations in the game. These include some video games that have previously been seen on \"The Simpsons\", such as the boxing game \"Slugfest\" that Homer and Bart played in the season one episode \"Moaning Lisa\".\n\n\"Virtual Springfield\" was published by Fox Interactive for Windows and Macintosh computers in 1997. It was developed by Digital Evolution. When the designers were working on the 3D-visualizations of Springfield at Fox Interactive for the game, they conceived of the project to construct a real-life replica of the Simpsons' house and gave it away in a contest.\n\nCast members of \"The Simpsons\", including Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor, Tress MacNeille, Maggie Roswell, and Phil Hartman, provided their voices for the dialog in the game. Bonita Pietila, who has worked on the show, directed the voice actors. The game also includes the theme song from \"The Simpsons\" by Danny Elfman. \"Virtual Springfield\" was rated Teen (T) in North America by the Entertainment Software Rating Board for \"animated violence\", \"comic mischief\", and \"suggestive themes\".\n\nCritics have given the game mixed reviews. \"Billboard\"s Doug Reece commented that \"Unfortunately, the detail is so great that there are moments when \"Virtual Springfield\" can become somewhat tedious.\" Nancy Basile of About.com gave the game a three out of five rating, criticizing the lack of a plot but praising the humor. She wrote that \"Virtual Springfield\" \"isn't so much a game as an interactive tour of Springfield and \"The Simpsons\" characters. Though your task is to collect trading cards around town, it doesn't offer any difficulty in finding them. The game controls make it difficult, however, to pick up the cards and collect them. The real fun of \"Virtual Springfield\" is browsing the Kwik-E-Mart, visiting Krustylu Studios or hangin' on Evergreen Terrace with the Simpson family. The entire cast lent their voice to this game, so meeting the characters and hearing their quotes is a lot of laughs.\"\n\nMark Kanarick of All Game Guide also gave \"Virtual Springfield\" a three out of five rating. He praised the game for its references to the television series, noting that \"The inside jokes and story-lines alone make the game worth it for those that are fans. For casual viewers and non-viewers, however, there is not enough here to warrant purchase of \"The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield\".\" Kanarick further wrote that while exploring Springfield was fun at times, \"it is also very tedious. Reading the map can be a problem, especially for younger kids. If you do not utilize the map to its full extent, you will most likely find yourself lost in the town and unsure of where to go next. Although it is a full town, you do at times feel very constricted, as you can only change directions at certain corners. The rest of the time you are just moving where the computer is telling you to.\"\n\nJoe Toledo of \"Animation World\" wrote in his review that \"While the software has game-like elements, it is lacking the depth of a true game. The individual objectives to get into each location are very easy to achieve. Once you've been around town a few times, traveling in real time between locations starts to get a bit long. [...] Plus, even though there are 17 great locations to visit, once you've been to them several times, the novelty starts to wear off. [...] \"Virtual Springfield\" would have benefited from having a better gaming element incorporated into it, slowly revealing more locations around town and introducing the characters one by one to extend playing time and add an extra layer of depth.\"\n"}

It is located at the top of Corner Inlet opposite Wilsons Promontory National Park. In the the population was 681.\n\nThe Post Office opened on 18 August 1882.\n\nLocated on the South Gippsland Highway east of Wilsons Promontory, Toora was first named Muddy Creek in the 1860s when a timber mill was set up on a 640-acre Mangrove Pre-emptive Right to supply much needed hardwood for the colony. The gold boom had led to a building surge in Melbourne when blue gum sleepers were used in the first piers constructed at Port Melbourne while railway sleepers were sent to India when the British Government were constructing hundreds of miles of railway lines.\n\nGeorge Buchanan built a sawmill at Sealers Cove on Wilsons Promontory but the supply of timber was too limited and in 1853 he arranged for it to be relocated first to Agnes River and then across to Muddy Creek. Situated on the east bank of Muddy Creek, Buchanan's Mill had contracts for many types of sawn timber which was transported across the mangrove swamp to Swan Bay where it was loaded onto barges which carried them to larger boats anchored in deeper water in Corner Inlet. Parts of the old tramlines and loading facilities still remain.\n\nMore mills were established in the thickly forested hills and the timber was transported on tramlines across swamps and taken to seaports by barges.\n\nNot far from the old mill site, still on the coastal plain, during the depression of the 1890s the government of the day encouraged settlement of the area as farming land under the Village Settlement Scheme but the blocks were too small and the scheme failed. The abandoned land was taken up for dairying and the fattening of cattle. These are the main industries of the area today.\n\nThe Toora Magistrates' Court closed on 1 July 1981, not having been visited by a Magistrate since 1971.\n\nFurther inland, the spectacular countryside continues to offer new views at every turn. North of Toora beyond Mt. Best and Mt. Fatigue is the beautiful Gunyah Gunyah Forest which is home to huge mountain ash, colourful beeches, wattles and magnificent tree ferns. The sounds of the lyre birds are always present.

The effect will give the impression that the sun is rising earlier than it actually should, and depending on the meteorological situation, the effect will present the Sun as a line or a square—sometimes referred to as the rectangular sun—made up of flattened hourglass shapes.\n\nThe mirage requires rays of sunlight to travel through an inversion layer for hundreds of kilometres, and depends on the inversion layer's temperature gradient. The sunlight must bend to the Earth's curvature at least to allow an elevation rise of 5° for sight of the solar disk.\n\nThe first person to record the phenomenon was Gerrit de Veer, a member of Willem Barentsz's ill-fated third expedition into the north polar region in 1596–1597. Trapped by the ice, the party was forced to stay for the winter in a makeshift lodge on the archipelago of Novaya Zemlya and endure the polar night.\n\nOn 24 January 1597, De Veer and another crew member claimed to have seen the Sun appear above the horizon, two full weeks prior to its calculated return. They were met with disbelief by the rest of the crew—who accused De Veer of having used the old Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar introduced several years earlier—but on 27 January, the Sun was seen by all \"in his full roundnesse\". For centuries the account was the source of skepticism, until in the 20th century the phenomenon was finally proven to be genuine.\n\nApart from the image of the Sun, the effect can also elevate the image of other objects above the horizon, such as coastlines which are normally invisible due to their distance. After studying the Saga of Erik the Red, Waldemar Lehn concluded that the effect may have aided the Vikings in their discovery of Iceland and Greenland, which are not visible from the mainland under normal atmospheric conditions.\n\n"}

The band combines traditional Norwegian folk music and folklore with rock, progressive rock and metal. The group has both male and female vocals with violin, guitar and drums.\n\nAfter having released a self-produced demo, the band released an EP called \"Åsmund Frægdegjevar\" in 2001 under contract with the record company Spinefarm Records. The next year, the band moved to Tabu Recordings and released their debut album, which had the same title as the previously released EP. The album was characterized by its blend of classical instruments and heavy metal. The songs make up a narrative about the saga of Åsmund, who in Lumsk's interpretation sails from Ireland to rescue a king's daughter from a group of trolls.\n\nSeveral years later, and with a new vocalist, the band released its second album, called \"Troll\". The album was a departure in many ways from its predecessor - the band had gotten a new vocalist and guitarist, and as a whole the music was not as heavy or dark as on the debut album. There were also fewer songs, and together they didn't compose one narrative, but were rather stories in and of themselves; stories which were based on Nordic mythology and were written by the saga author Birger Sivertsen and his wife Kristin.\n\nThe same year the band released the single \"Nidvisa\", which, in addition to the song \"Allvis\" from \"Troll\", contained a song written for the action group \"Give Us Back Christmas\" (\"Gi oss jula tilbake\" in Norwegian) in protest against department stores' early Christmas decorating. The profits from the sale of the single also went to the group.\n\nOn February 26, 2007, Lumsk released their third full-length album, entitled Det Vilde Kor. On this album, Lumsk have added music to Det Vilde Kor, which is a collection of poems written by the famous Norwegian poet Knut Hamsun. With this album the music departed from its folk metal sound and incorporated a calmer and slightly more progressive nature.\n\nIn July 2007 Espen announced on Lumsk's website that Ketil and Siv Lena would be leaving the band due to a baby being born. They were replaced by Swedish musicians Håkan Lundqvist and Jenny Gustafsson. In 2009 Annelise Ofstad Aar joined the band, as a replacement for vocalist Stine Mari Langstrand, who also left in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Owned by Florida State University, it is a sister station to National Public Radio (NPR) members WFSU-FM (88.9) and WFSQ (91.5 FM). The three stations share studios at the Public Broadcast Center on the Florida State campus; WFSU-TV's transmitter is located near Bloxham, Florida.\n\nWFSG (virtual channel 56, UHF digital channel 28) in Panama City operates as a full-time satellite of WFSU-TV; this station's transmitter is located near Ebro. WFSG covers areas of northwest Florida that receive a marginal to non-existent over-the-air signal from WFSU-TV, although there is significant overlap between the two stations' contours otherwise. WFSG is a straight simulcast of WFSU-TV; on-air references to WFSG are limited to Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-mandated hourly station identifications during programming. Aside from the transmitter, WFSG does not maintain any physical presence locally in Panama City. Although Panama City is in the Central Time Zone, all schedules are listed in Eastern Time.\n\nWFSU-TV went on the air for the first time on September 20, 1960 on channel 11. The FCC had allocated only one VHF channel (channels 2-13) to the Tallahassee marketplace. After the Tallahassee market was expanded to include a large portion of southwest Georgia, Florida State persuaded the FCC to make channel 11 a noncommercial license. Channels 14-69 in the UHF spectrum were available, but were not as easily accessible to television viewers, and were not seen as viable at the time. While this move assured north-central Florida and southwest Georgia of PBS service, it also meant that Tallahassee would have a long wait for full service from all three major commercial networks, since the VHF channel was already allocated, and the available UHF channels were seen as undesirable. A commercial station wouldn't sign on in the Tallahassee market until WECA-TV (now WTXL-TV) opened in 1976.\n\nWFSG signed on July 22, 1988, replacing a low-powered translator on channel 22 that had served Panama City since the late 1970s.\n\nIn 1973, \"Florida Public Broadcasting\" (FPB), a joint venture between WFSU-TV and WJCT in Jacksonville, and under the aegis of the Florida Public Broadcasting Service, began program coverage of the Florida Legislature, which was transmitted to and broadcast by the eight affiliated PBS television stations in Florida, from a mobile facility located on the grounds of the State Capitol. The program was called \"Today in the Legislature\", and was the first of its kind in the United States, preceding legislative programs in other states, and U.S. Congressional coverage by C-SPAN.\n\nReaction to the first year of the program was positive. The state legislature dedicated funds to expand the program, managed exclusively by WJCT. Production facilities migrated into the (old) Capitol building, with engineering and studio facilities constructed on the third floor. The first broadcast from the new facility was on April 2, 1974. \"Today in the Legislature\" expanded into an hour-long weekday program during the legislative session, with a one-hour Spanish language summary, \"Hoy en la Legislatura\" produced on Fridays as well as a sign language program. It was hosted by veteran broadcaster Jim Lewis, with additional commentary by Elizabeth \"Bib\" Willis. Research, engineering, and production crews were composed chiefly of recent graduates from the Florida State University Department of Communications (now the Florida State University College of Motion Picture, Television and Recording Arts), nearly all under the age of 25, including producer Elliott C. Mitchell and director John P. Leu, as well as future Georgia legislator Chesley V. Morton, who worked as a still photographer and camera operator for the program. \"Today in the Legislature\" was described as a \"unique blend of television of record and more conventional news coverage.\" A research study concluded that the program generated more positive attitudes about the legislature and increased political knowledge in adolescents who viewed the broadcast, although only 12% found the programming to be \"interesting\".\n\nThe stations' digital signals are multiplexed: \nWFSU-TV and WFSG shut down their analog signals on February 17, 2009, the original target date in which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows:\n\nWFSU-TV operates a statewide public affairs network, The Florida Channel, that covers the state legislature, a local version of C-SPAN. This network is seen on selected cable TV systems and government-access television (GATV) channels throughout the state of Florida.\n\nWFSU-TV also operates \"4FSU\", which carries simulcasts of The Florida Channel and programming related to the university community; it also provides a training ground for students studying for careers in the broadcasting field.\n\nIn June 2011, it was revealed that WFSU-TV will receive $2.8 million in funding for various services related to Florida government, including The Florida Channel. This is despite the $4.8 million of funding to other public radio and television stations vetoed by Governor Rick Scott in May 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "2034956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034956", "title": "Pulau Semakau", "text": "Pulau Semakau\n\nPulau Semakau (or Semakau Island) is located to the south of the main island of Singapore, off the Straits of Singapore. The Semakau Landfill is located on the eastern side of the island, and was created by the amalgamation of Pulau Sakeng (also known as Pulau Seking), and \"anchored\" to Pulau Semakau. The Semakau Landfill is Singapore's first offshore landfill and now the only remaining landfill in Singapore.\n\nPulau Semakau was home to a small fishing village, as was the nearby island of Pulau Sakeng (Chinese: 锡京岛) which was also known as Pulau Seking. Houses built on both islands were perched on stilts as most of the villagers were subsistence fishermen, making a living off the nearby coral reefs. Both islands had a few provision shops but the community centre was located on Pulau Semakau while the Pulau Sakeng Police Post (manned by a Marine Police officer of the Singapore Police Force) was situated on Pulau Sakeng.\n\nIn 1987, the Singapore government, after having acquired the land on both islands from the islanders, set about relocating the islanders to the mainland where they were resettled in the Bukit Merah and Telok Blangah housing estate areas by HDB. One of the oldest residents continued to live on the Pulau Sakeng despite his family having been resettled but he eventually moved out as well in 1991, as the island's jetty fell into a sorry state of disrepair. The Singapore SPCA was tasked with rounding up the few cats that were left behind after his departure.\n\nSubsequently, Pulau Sakeng was subsumed by the land reclamation process of Pulau Semakau and the present day Semakau landfill receiving station was built directly on top of Pulau Sakeng after that process.\n\nPulau Semakau and the neighbouring area is the home to the largest barramundi farm in Singapore, owned by Barramundi Asia (Kühlbarra). The location is chosen for its strong current and high oxygen content, necessary for strong growth of the fish. \n\nThe Semakau Landfill is Singapore's first and only landfill situated offshore among the southern islands of Singapore. It covers a total area of 3.5 square kilometres and has a capacity of 63 million m³. To create the required landfill space, a 7 km perimeter rock bund was built to enclose a part of the sea between Pulau Semakau and Pulau Sakeng. it was estimated that the landfill, which began operations on 1 Apr 1999, will last until 2045. The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, along with the National Environment Agency which manages the landfill, hopes this deadline will be extended through various waste minimisation and resource conservation initiatives.\n\nSemakau Landfill is filled mainly with ash produced by Singapore's four incineration plants, which incinerate the country's waste, shipped there in a covered barge (to prevent the ash from getting blown into the air) every night. Contrary to popular belief that Semakau Landfill would be another dirty and smelly landfill, the care put into the design and operational work at the landfill has ensured that the site is clean, free of smell and scenic. During construction, silt screens were installed to ensure that the corals were not affected during the reclamation works. The landfill is lined with an impermeable membrane, and clay and any leachate produced is processed at a leachate treatment plant. Regular water testing is carried out to ensure the integrity of the impermeable liners.\n\nA new REMEX Minerals facility at Tuas began operations in July 2015, recovering tens of thousands of tonnes of metal from the remains of incinerated rubbish using magnetic and eddy separators. This reduces the weight of incinerated rubbish by around 10%, hence benefiting the landfill that may run out of space in 2035. \n\nTerrestrial flora and fauna\n\nThe terrestrial flora and fauna of the (natural) island has not been fully surveyed. At least 5 species of amphibians, 12 species of reptiles and 6 species mammals have been recorded on the island.\n\nMarine flora and fauna\n\nThe coral reefs around Pulau Semakau have been monitored since the late 1980s to 2001, by the National University of Singapore, and from 2005 to the present by the \"Reef Friends\" programme (a joint project between the National Biodiversity Centre, National Parks Board and Blue Water Volunteers). Results of the surveys can be found at the 'Coral Reefs of Singapore' webpage and Blue Water Volunteers webpage.\n\nThe intertidal areas\n\nA survey of the coastal and inter-tidal areas of the island in 2005 revealed four plants listed as endangered in Singapore, including the Seashore Bat Lily (\"Tacca leontopetaloides\") which so far has only been recorded in one area of Singapore: Pulau Semakau. Semakau also has vast stretches of Tape seagrass (\"Enhalus acoroides\") which is considered rare and vulnerable in Singapore. Semakau is also the only known location in Singapore of the seagrass \"Syringodium isoetifolium\". The seagrass meadow is being monitored by the recently set up 'Team Seagrass'.\n\nThe mangroves\n\nThe construction of the perimeter bund of the Landfill affected mangroves on the eastern side of the island. The developers replanted two plots of mangroves totaling 136,000 square metres, just outside the perimeter bund. The two plots are doing well, indicating that there has been no seepage through the liners. Another design feature is the built-in channels that allow the flow of seawater into non-active cells, keeping the water fresh at all times.\n\nToday, after years of operation, the replanted mangrove, and remaining natural habitats on the island are doing well. Even the closed cells, topped up with soil, are flourishing. Birds can be seen in the air and on the open landscape, fishes swim in and out of the lagoons, and marine life continues to thrive in the mangrove mudflats and the western shorelines of Pulau Semakau.\n\nA coral nursery was set up beside Pulau Semakau on 31 July 2007 to enhance hard coral cover and diversity in Singapore. This is a collaborative effort between the National Biodiversity Centre, National Parks Board, Keppel Corporation, National University of Singapore and the National Environment Agency.\n\nSuitable candidate species for coral culture are collected from existing reefs at Pulau Semakau as well as from other reefs in Singapore. The naturally occurring collected larvae, nubbins and fragments would be grown to sufficient sizes in the field nursery until they can be transplanted to recipient coral reefs for restoration or enhancement purposes. This is probably the first coral nursery in the region that utilises such \"corals of opportunity\".\n\nThe latest report on the status of the coral nursery can be viewed here. \n\nThe National Parks Board, National Biodiversity Centre, TeamSeagrass and volunteers from the public regularly conduct surveys and monitoring of the seagrasses found in Singapore in the inter-tidal areas such as Chek Jawa and Labrador Nature Reserve. The seagrass meadow at Pulau Semakau is one of the monitoring sites. These surveys are part of Seagrass-Watch, a global seagrass assessment and monitoring programme spanning 18 countries with more than 200 monitoring sites worldwide. Non-destructive scientific surveying methods developed by Seagrass-Watch are adopted. Data gathered is then fed back to Seagrass-Watch Headquarters, which then analyses the trends and condition of seagrass habitats at the local, regional and global scale.\n\nThe National Parks Board, National Biodiversity Centre and the Tropical Marine Science Institute jointly launched a collaborative project to survey and identify the intertidal sponges around Singapore. The inter-tidal area of Pulau Semakau is one of the 24 locations. Although sponges are commonly found on our shores, they are poorly known due to the limited studies conducted.\n\nThe 1-year study yielded a total of 102 species of intertidal sponges. One species new to science, \"Suberites diversicolor\", was described and a large number of 40 species of intertidal sponges were recorded for the first time in Singapore.\n\nThe National Environment Agency on 16 July 2005 officially opened Semakau Landfill to the public for selected recreational activities. It was launched by the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, with 40 families of the former residents of Pulau Sakeng, one of the small islands from which Semakau Landfill was built, invited back to their former home as guests of the event. The residents had left over 10 years earlier. The opinions of various interest groups and organisations such as Nature Society of Singapore, Sport Fishing Association (Singapore) and Wild Singapore in using Semakau Landfill for recreational purposes were sought. Currently, members of the public who wish to visit the island are advised to contact TASOS, Starfish Learning Journey, Nature Society, Sport Fishing Association, or the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research which conducts guided walks on the shores of Semakau for the public. All groups are led by a trained guide. This supervision is in place to protect the island's natural environment. From 2010 onwards, the National Environment Agency will took over management of guided walks on Semakau from Raffles Museum.\n\nFurther, facilities have been put in place, such as strategically located shelters, lightning arresters and lifebuoys, as well as directional signage and clear markings of no-access areas to keep visitors away from the operation areas.\n\nTargeting interested groups in Singapore now have a unique recreational destination in the form of a huge open ash-filled landfill tucked away in the pristine waters of southern Singapore, coexisting with a mix of mangrove, grassland and shoreline habitats.\n\n"}

He came to prominence in 1991, as a leader of the Sahwah movement which opposed the presence of US troops on the Arabian peninsula. In 1993, al-Hawali and Salman al-Ouda were leaders in creating the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights, a group that opposed the Saudi government, for which both were imprisoned from 1994 to 1999.\n\nIn July 2018 he was detained by the Saudi authorities, along with his four sons and brother, for writing a 3,000-page book titled \"Muslims and Western Civilisation\". The book is said to include \"attacks on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and the ruling Saudi royal family over their ties to Israel.\"\n\nSafar al-Hawali Alghamdi received his doctorate in Islamic theology from Umm al-Qura University, Mecca in 1986. During the 1990s, he was arrested for a period of time by the Saudi authorities for his criticism of the government when he distributed sermons on cassette tapes to incite militants to overthrow the government. Along with another preacher Salman al-Ouda, al-Hawali is said to have led the \"Sahwa movement\" (Awakening movement) in Saudi Arabia, a form of Qutbism.\n\nSafar al-Hawali was one of the leaders of The Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR) that was a Saudi dissident group created in 1993 and was the first ever opposition organization in the Kingdom openly challenging the monarchy, accusing the government and senior ulama of not doing enough to protect the legitimate Islamic rights of the Muslims.\n\nIn September 1994, two leaders of the Committee, Salman al-Ouda and Safar al-Hawali were arrested together with a large number of their followers in the city of Burayda, Qasim region. Moreover, Sheikh Abd al-Aziz Ibn Baz issued a fatwa, that unless al-Quda and al-Hawali repented their former conduct, they would be banned from lecturing, meetings and cassette-recording. In 1999, he and two other scholars were arrested, but were then released without any charge. Hawali has since parted ways with Salman al-Ouda.\n\nLike many Saudis, American libertarian politicians and anti war activists, and indigenous religious communities of the Middle East, former veteran of the Afghan Soviet war Osama bin Laden, and another preacher Salman al-Ouda, al-Hawali opposed the presence of US troops on the Arabian peninsula. In 1991, al-Hawali delivered a sermon stating: \"What is happening in the [Persian] Gulf is part of a larger Western design to dominate the whole Arab and Muslim world.\" Bin Laden is said to often cite al-Hawali and al-Oada \"to justify his own pronouncements against the United States.\" \n\nHawali was invited to the First Meeting of the Saudi National Meeting For Intellectual Dialogue held in June 2003 but declined to attend in protest against the inclusion of `deviants` at the meeting—namely non-Wahhabi religious leaders of the Sunni and Shia Muslim communities of Saudi Arabia. Al-Hawali did, however, condemned al-Qaeda's May 2003 attacks in Riyadh.\nSafar al-Hawali wrote a book on secularism as part of his master thesis at Umm Al-Qura. This research was supervised by Muhammad Qutb, the brother of Sayyid Qutb. Here al-Hawali traced the history of the separation between the church and state and how the idea was imported to the Muslim world. In his Ph.D. research, al-Hawali made an analysis of the separation between the claim of faith and deeds of worship.\n\nIn the year 2000, he wrote a treatise on the Second Intifada, entitled \"The Day of Wrath\". He argued that the Biblical prophecies used by Christian fundamentalists to support the state of Israel actually predict its destruction. The treatise was subsequently translated into Hebrew by the Anti-Zionist Neturei Karta group.\n\nAfter September 11, 2001, al-Hawali wrote an open letter to President Bush.\n\nWhen 60 American intellectuals issued an article justifying America's war in Iraq, al-Hawali wrote a counter-article, rebutting their claims and pointing to the history of US foreign policy.\n\nAl-Hawali wrote an article in \"Al-Bayan\" magazine on unitarianism among Christians. He traced the history of those who reject the doctrine of the Trinity, and believe in One Supreme God. He claimed that monotheists had been subject to great persecution, by both Catholics and Protestants; and that five among the US presidents had been Unitarians.\nHe has also written a book on the history and meaning of Secularism, in his Arabic book \"Al Ilmaniya\" meaning Secularism. In this book he has identified Church's incapability to cope with challenges of modern world as the main cause of spread of Secular ideologies in Europe.\n\nHe is mentioned in Osama bin Laden's fatwa as a sheikh unjustly arrested allegedly \"by orders from the USA.\"\n\nSamuel P. Huntington included al-Hawali in his famous \"Clash of Civilizations\" article. \"'It is not the world against Iraq,' as Safar al-Hawali, dean of Islamic Studies at the Umm Al-Qura University in Mecca, put it in a widely circulated tape. 'It is the West against Islam.'\"\n\nAl-Hawali was named as a \"theologian of terror\" in an October 2004 petition to the UN signed by 2,500 Muslim intellectuals calling for a treaty to ban the religious incitement to violence.\n\n"}

He went to Boston in 1804, working during the day and reading books of architecture and drawing in the evenings.\n\nHis handiness as a carver improved rapidly and he was employed for carved architectural details for many important late Federal and Greek Revival buildings in Boston, such as the Ionic and Corinthian capitals for the steeple of Park Street Church, built in 1810. In the same year he carved the eagle for the pediment of the new Custom House.\n\nIn 1818 he made a model of the capitol at Washington for Charles Bulfinch, who was then engaged on the Massachusetts State House, and later did several further works of this sort, among which were models of the Pantheon and the Parthenon for Edward Everett. From wood carving he turned to stone carving, and in 1820 was engaged on the Ionic capitals and other stonework of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Boston, the first example of Greek Revival architecture in Boston. By 1821 Willard had become so successful that he gave classes in architecture and drawing in his studio near St. Paul's; there Horatio Greenough was a pupil. Willard added ship figureheads to his craft, from 1823.\n\nOn November 2, 1825, Willard was chosen architect and superintendent of Bunker Hill Monument, his design having been accepted by the building committee in the following year. Construction began in 1827. Willard discovered satisfactory granite quarries for the stone at Quincy, and the granite for the monument came from there. Willard also invented the machinery to cut and handle the slabs of stone in what became known as the Bunker Hill Quarry, which evolved into a major industry for the town. To get the cut slabs to a wharf on the Neponset River, a distance of two and three-quarters miles, the first commercial railway in the United States was built—the Granite Railway—over which, on the morning of October 7, 1826, the first horse-drawn cars passed, under the direction of a young engineer by the name of Gridley Bryant.\n\nWillard's work on the Bunker Hill Monument was succinctly recorded in 1849, by Amos Lawrence, secretary of the Building Committee, who wrote in the flyleaf of the committee's records: \"Solomon Willard walked three hundred miles to examine granite quarries (Hallowell, Maine, and other places), gave a thousand dollars to the Monument Association, and worked like a dog for the association for years for merely his necessary expenses (which were very small), and is now at work at Quincy\" (\"History\" 1926).\n\nHe was engaged in this work for seventeen years, being frequently interrupted by want of funds and by disagreements in the committee in charge, but on July 23, 1842, the top stone of the monument was laid, and on the anniversary of the battle in 1843 its completion was celebrated in the presence of the president of the United States, his cabinet, and a large concourse of citizens from every part of the United States.\n\nIn Framingham, Massachusetts, Willard's First Baptist Church, Framingham of 1826 still stands, now the oldest building in the town. The Norfolk County Courthouse in Dedham, Massachusetts is also his work. In the same year he was also architect of Divinity Hall, Harvard Divinity School with Thomas Sumner. Willard also designed the Greek Revival Framingham Town Hall. The Gothic Revival Church of St. John the Evangelist on Bowdoin Street, Boston, dated to 1831, is also probably his design.\n\nHe is credited with designing some of the first hot-air central heating in an American building. In 1829 his recent pupil, the brilliant young architect Isaiah Rogers, designed the innovative Tremont House in Boston. This was the first American hotel to have indoor plumbing and it became the prototype of a modern, first-class American hotel.\n\nHe also supervised construction of the Captain Nathan Hale Monument in Coventry, Connecticut, which is a 45-foot obelisk.\n\nWillard died in Quincy, Massachusetts. In 1865, William W. Wheildon wrote a \"Memoir of Solomon Willard, Architect and Superintendent of the Bunker Hill Monument\" published by the Monument Association (Boston), which is the primary source for his biographers.\n\n\n"}

Starting in 1984 under the leadership of vocalist Katon W. De Pena (the band's only original member left in the current line-up), the band played in Los Angeles and San Francisco with several of their thrash metal peers such as Metallica, Exodus, and Slayer. The band was an early example of thrash metal, speed metal and crossover thrash.\n\nAfter releasing some demos, Hirax signed with Metal Blade and debuted with their first full-length, \"Raging Violence\" in 1985. The band was composed of Katon W. De Pena (vocals), Scott Owen (guitar), Gary Monardo (bass) and John Tabares (drums).\n\nIn 1986, John Tabares left the band and Eric Brecht (brother of D.R.I.'s vocalist Kurt Brecht) joined. After the change, they released their second album, called \"Hate, Fear and Power\" under pressure of the label (only having 16 minutes of length for 8 songs). After this release, the band quit the label and independently released a demo called \"Blasted In Bangkok\" in 1987.\n\nBut with tensions and disillusions in the band, De Pena decided to leave and form a new band with Gene Hoglan (former Dark Angel drummer), and Ron McGovney (former Metallica bassist). They called themselves Phantasm and released a six-track demo in 1988 (re-issued in 2002 as a CD with the demo and live tracks). After a brief tour with Nuclear Assault, they broke up. In 1989, after De Pena left, the replacement was Paul Baloff (former Exodus frontman). But soon after the band broke up.\n\nDe Pena stayed involved in the regional underground music scene and took a job working at a local music store. In 1997, he featured one of his old songs on a split 7\" with Spazz, the band of one of his friends. By 1998 De Pena had received enough fan mail and interest which encouraged him to reunite Hirax in 2000. De Pena reunited the band with the original lineup of Scott Owen, Gary Monardo, and John Tabares, releasing the \"El Diablo Negro\" EP in 2000. In 2002, the band played in Abrasive Rock Fest. In 2003, the band played in Bang Your Head Festival, in Germany. The lineup completely changed, and Hirax released the album \"Barrage of Noise\" in 2001 with James Joseph Hubler, Justin Lent (Clusterfux), and Nick Sellinger. This line-up was brief as well.\n\nIn 2003, De Pena recruited an entirely new lineup again, and released the album \"The New Age of Terror\" in 2004 with guitarists Dave Watson and Glenn Rogers (Deliverance former), bassist Angelo Espino, and drummer Jorge Iacobellis. That line-up, due to irreconcilable differences, followed in the trend of the other line-ups and broke up. The band released their fourth studio album \"El Rostro de la Muerte\" in the spring of 2009. On July 20, 2013 Hirax performed at the International Festival Convivencia Rock 2013 that took place in Pereira, Risaralda. 36 bands played in the 3 days festival and 10.000 people gathered each day of the event. On February 24, 2014, the band released their latest album titled \"Immortal Legacy\", courtesy of Steamhammer Records.\n\nMarch 2015 saw the band play in the UK for the first time in their history, beginning with an appearance at Hammerfest in Gwynedd, Wales. Hirax still performs regularly to this day, and they are currently working on a new album, which is due for release in 2020 or 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2034990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034990", "title": "The Simpsons Wrestling", "text": "The Simpsons Wrestling\n\nThe Simpsons Wrestling is a fighting video game based on the animated television series \"The Simpsons\". Developed by Big Ape Productions and published by Activision (Electronic Arts in Europe) for the PlayStation, it was first released in Europe in March 2001, followed by North America a month later. It is also the only Simpsons video game released for the PlayStation.\n\nThere are 20 characters in the game, all of whom are voiced by the same actors that provide their voices in the show, and each character executes his or her own exclusive moves and gestures and power moves in the wrestling ring. The matches take place in detailed 3D locations from Springfield. A round in the game ends when one wrestler pins their opponent for a three count. Two victorious rounds wins a match. Unlike in traditional wrestling rules, the opponent may be pinned belly-down.\n\nThe game was widely panned by critics, and is considered to be one of the worst video games of all time.\n\nThe game is loosely based on professional wrestling games, but more closely resembles a beat-'em up. The game can be played in two modes: a tournament style single-player game or a grudge match where two players can interact. The matches take place in ten different detailed 3D locations from Springfield, such as the Simpsons' house, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, the Kwik-E-Mart, and Moe's Tavern. Letters float around in the wrestling ring, and if a wrestler collects enough of them, they can taunt and temporarily become invincible. A round ends when one wrestler pins their opponent for a three count. Two rounds are needed to win a match.\n\nEach time a successful attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health by picking up food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player does not have enough stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.\n\nDuring matches, wrestlers have a health meter that drains as they perform special moves, and gradually refills when they are not attacking. Different moves use up different amounts of energy, and certain characters can win any match by repeatedly using a particularly damaging move that does not require much energy. Several different power-ups are also available in the game, including a donut that increases speed, bowling pins that can be used as clubs, and bubble gum that slows players down.\n\nIn addition to health items, the letters A, N, U and T appear randomly in the ring. If either player collects enough to spell the word \"TAUNT\", they can then perform a taunt. The taunt will completely drain the opponent's stamina, making them unable to attack for a limited time.\n\nThe game features 20 characters from the show, all of whom are voiced by the same actors that provide their voices in \"The Simpsons\". The player begins with only 8 of the 12 main characters to begin with. Others can be made playable by unlocking them, or unlocking a certain game mode.\n\n\nThe voice of Kent Brockman can be heard occasionally during matches as a commentator. Various characters make cameos as background images. Each character executes their own exclusive moves and gestures.\n\nBig Ape Productions developed \"The Simpsons Wrestling\". At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2000, Fox Interactive announced its plans to produce and publish the game for the PlayStation console. Karly Young, director of Fox Interactive, said that the company had received an \"overwhelming\" response to their previous \"Simpsons\" games, so they wanted to give the fans \"another dose of Bart and Homer—this time for PlayStation gamers\".\n\nThe following months, Fox Interactive looked to partner with somebody who could help publish the game. Activision, who knew the possible casual gamer interest in \"The Simpsons\", announced on March 12, 2001 that it had signed a deal with Fox Interactive that would allow it to publish \"The Simpsons Wrestling\" in North America. Kathy Vrabeck, executive vice president of Activision, commented that \"\"The Simpsons\" is a property that enjoys phenomenal success across several entertainment mediums, including interactive entertainment. The acquisition of this game reinforces our strategy of delivering products based on powerful, recognizable brands.\"\n\n\"The Simpsons Wrestling\" received negative reviews from critics. It received an aggregated score of 41.21% on GameRankings and 32/100 on Metacritic. They criticized the game for having simplistic, unbalanced gameplay and bad graphics, but praised the game's audio track.\n\nDoug Perry of IGN described \"The Simpsons Wrestling\" as one of the \"ugliest\" games he had ever seen. He thought the graphics were \"choppy\" looking, and the character outlines looked \"broken up\". \"Game Informer\"'s Andrew Reiner criticized the game's design by saying that he did not think it held any wrestling qualities at all, and that the characters looked \"awful\". He said that instead of \"grappling\" or performing \"devastating slams\", you have to \"slap your opponent silly\" by mashing the buttons redundantly. GameZone, however, called the graphics \"quite good, though a little clipped at times by the pace of the combat\". Perry also thought there was little wrestling in the game, instead it is \"all about smashing buttons and not having any skill whatsoever\". Reiner said that the game was a major disappointment and is \"one of the worst PS games to date\".\n\nScott Steinberg reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it one star out of five, and stated that \"A horrific, licensed beat-'em up that's so terrible it will actually make you grateful most companies opt for kart racers instead.\"\n\nIn contrast to the game's negative response, GameZone said that even though the game does not feature continuous play, \"the action flows well once into an event\". GameZone's review praised the game's audio track, and thought it was \"fun\" because the comedy is straight from the television show, and the characters will \"bring a smile to your face\". Reiner also commented positively on the soundtrack and that the game may not be the best wrestling game available, \"but it delivers what the cover advertises\". GameSpot's Frank Provo said that \"wit\" and \"charm\" are the two most redeeming features of \"The Simpsons Wrestling\", and in spite of the game's weak gameplay, it has \"plenty of laughs in store\" that devoted fans of \"The Simpsons\" will enjoy. The BBC's David Gibbon wrote that the end result of the track is one that will not \"fail to impress fans\".\n\n\"The Simpsons Wrestling\" received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n"}

The club was originally called United Services Devonport and had their first recorded match back in 1904. Devonport Services play their homes games at the Rectory Field and their strip and club colours are dark blue and red. They are currently competing in Tribute South West 1 West at tier 6 of the English rugby union league system following their promotion from Tribute Western Counties West via the play-offs.\n\nOnce open to the members of the British Armed Forces only, the rules have been relaxed since the mid 1990s, therefore allowing civilians to play alongside serving armed forces players. However, the club rules stipulate that at least 50% of the club's senior squad playing must be members of the Armed Forces - mainly from the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. As well as first team the club runs 2nd and 3rd teams, colts, and the occasional Vets team. There are also multiple youth teams for boys (7-16) and girls (15-18).\n\nAlthough the beginnings of the club are hazy they were certainly established during the first decade of the 20th century. The team, then known as United Services Devonport, was initially open to officers of the British Armed Forces, with the first recorded match being on 1 October 1904 when Services played out a 2-2 draw against Plymouth RFC (a parent club of Plymouth Albion) in front of a crowd of 6,000. During the early stages of the club the team did not perform particularly well until 1912 when the club opened its playing membership to other ranks in the military and results improved dramatically.\n\nThe first mention of the club using the current name of Devonport Services with any regularity was around 1910/1911, although occasionally the press covering games would call them United Services leading to a degree of confusion. In 1912 the club got given its nickname \"The Sporting Blues\" by the South Wales Echo who used this name as part of their headline when covering the Services game away to Swansea. The Services initially played home games at Keyham, owned by the RNEC but during 1920s they moved to the Rectory Field in Devonport. The Rectory Field had previously been occupied by Devonport Albion, who were the strongest side in Devon during the early 20th century, but the ground was sold for £6,500 to the Navy in 1920. In the same year Devonport Albion merged with Plymouth RFC to form Plymouth Albion and subsequently moved to Beacon Park. In 1928 the Rectory Field was procured by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Sports Control Board who rented it out to Devonport Services who have remained there ever since.\n\nDuring World War II the Rectory Field was destroyed by fire due to Luftwaffe bombing raids, leaving only a small section of stand considered safe enough for spectators. The post war years would see the Rectory Field rebuilt, leaving Devonport Services without a home ground for several years. By 1948 the damaged main stand was rebuilt and space for around 1,200 supporters, while additional facilities such as separate changing rooms and a bar were added and a second stand was also added - leading to the ground becoming known as the “Twickenham of the West”. After being rebuilt the Rectory Field had a capacity of around 7,000 - which was the largest recorded attendance when the Combined Services played the All Blacks on the 30 November 1993.\n\nAs well as hosting the All Blacks, the early 1990s were a successful time for the club as they won back to back league titles by winning Devon League 1 in 1992, followed by Tribute Cornwall/Devon in 1993. They spent four seasons in Western Counties West before being relegated in 1999. In 2003 Devonport Services won promotion by winning the Tribute Cornwall/Devon for the second time. Once again they enjoyed a number of seasons in Western Counties West until 2005 when a torrid season saw the go down in last place which just one league win all season. This relegation was short-lived as Services came second in Tribute Devon/Cornwall to earn promotion back to Western Counties West.\n\nSince 2005 the main stand (south stand) of the Rectory Field was closed due to safety concerns (it is made of wood and a fire hazard), leaving the current capacity at around 2,000 which includes the (still open) north stand and standing areas. Despite plans to demolish the stand in 2015 it remains part of the iconic ground.\n\nThe Chairman Captain Nigel Fergusson RN.\n\n\n37 players have gained men's senior international caps whilst at Devonport Services including 97 caps for England.\n\n\n12 players have gained youth international caps while at Devonport Services.\n\n\n95 players have gained county or representative caps while at Devonport Services.\n\n\n11 players have gained youth county or representative caps while at Devonport Services.\n\n\n\n\n2 players have gained international or representative caps while at Devonport Services.\n\n\n\n"}

Soriano, FAIA, (August 1, 1904 – July 21, 1988) was an architect and educator, who helped define a period of 20th-century architecture that came to be known as Mid-century modern. He pioneered the use of modular prefabricated steel and aluminum structures in residential and commercial design and construction.\n\nBorn in Rhodes, Greece to a Sephardic Jewish family, Soriano attended the College Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Rhodes, before emigrating to the United States in 1924. After settling with relatives in Los Angeles, he enrolled in the University of Southern California's School of Architecture in 1929, graduating in 1934. In 1930, he became an American citizen and, the following year, secured an internship at the practice of Richard Neutra, working alongside fellow interns Gregory Ain and Harwell Hamilton Harris. A brief internship with Rudolph Schindler in 1934 followed, but Soriano quickly returned to his unpaid position at Neutra's office.\n\nWith America in the throes of the Great Depression, Soriano managed to find work upon graduation with the County of Los Angeles on several WPA projects, such as the famous \"Steel Lobster\", and in a local architect's office. By 1936, he had completed his first commission, the Lipetz House, which appeared in the 1937 International Architectural Exhibition in Paris.\n\nWith residential and commercial construction in the U.S. stalled by the country's involvement in World War II, Soriano took up lecturing at USC and began contributing proposals for post-war housing designs to various competitions and publications. Of these, Soriano's \"Plywood House\" prototype received Third Prize in 1943 in the Postwar Living Competition, sponsored by Arts & Architecture magazine. Once the war ended, Soriano had no trouble securing commissions, now garnering prizes for his built projects, such as the Katz House, in Studio City, a 1949 recipient of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Southern California Chapter Three Award. The following year, the architect completed a home for a friend, renowned architectural photographer Julius Shulman, one of the few Soriano structures still standing. The Shulman residence and 1964 Grossman House were the last two occupied by their original owners.\n\nInvited by John Entenza of Arts & Architecture magazine to participate in the Case Study Houses program, Soriano completed his project in 1950. Pioneering in its use of steel in residential construction, the design marks a turning point for the program, later culminating in Pierre Koenig' s Case Study House #21 and #22. Soriano's Colby Apartments of 1951 — distinct not only for their modern design, but also for their extensive use of steel — received the National American Institute of Architects Award for Design, the VII International Pan American Congress Award, and the AIA Southern California Chapter One Honor Award.\n\nIn 1953, Soriano moved from Los Angeles to Tiburon, in Marin County, across the bay north of San Francisco, where he lived with his wife Elizabeth Stephens (Betty) and her two daughters, Margaret and Lucille Coberly. By 1955, Soriano had designed the first mass-produced steel house, which developer Joseph Eichler build in Palo Alto. His work with Eichler would garner two awards from the Northern California Chapter of the AIA.\n\nSoriano was made a Fellow by the American Institute of Architects (FAIA) in 1961. In 1965, he launched Soria Structures, Inc. to design and build prefabricated houses, marketed as \"All-Aluminum Homes.\" His last realized designs were eleven All-Aluminum Homes on the island of Maui, Hawaii, built in 1965.\n\nFrom 1970 until his death, in 1988, Soriano focused on traveling the world as an architectural lecturer, writer, and researcher. He was recognized by the AIA with a Distinguished Achievement Award and by USC with a Distinguished Alumni Award, both in 1986. Shortly before his death he served as a Special Sessions Instructor at the College of Environmental Design at Cal Poly Pomona.\n\nOf the 50 buildings Soriano built, only 12 remain; the others have succumbed to wildfire, earthquake, or demolition. Among the survivors, a number endured unsympathetic make-overs and additions. Those still intact and unmolested are now protected by municipal preservation codes. A collection of Soriano papers resides at the College of Environmental Design Special Collections at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona).\n\n"}

Though a friend and promoter of poets like Dylan Thomas and George Barker, Williams' own poetry is not highly regarded by critics, though he published several volumes during his lifetime, and is not nearly as accomplished as the poetry of his wife, Gene Derwood (1909–1954).\n\nAmong Williams' poems are \"Revenge,\" \"Poem,\" \"Poet,\" \"The Last Supper\" and \"I Sing an Old Song,\" \"The City's Face\".\n\n\"Shopping for Meat in Winter\" is a typical Williams poem, with its urban theme, forced rhyme, and attempts at replicating the neo-Romanticism of the New Apocalypse.\n\nOscar Williams and his poet-artist wife Gene Derwood sponsored an annual $15,000 poetry award which bears their name.\nThey lived in a penthouse of an office building on Water Street.\nIn his later years, Oscar Williams' home near Wall Street in Manhattan served as a mecca for young poets. Asked how he chose the poems used in his anthologies, he said, \"How do you pick one girl to marry? In poetry it's divine polygamy. Generally, when a poem stays with me a long time that poem delivers the goods\".\n\nThroughout his life, Oscar Williams eschewed his Jewish background. He was always mysterious about his origins and was buried by an Episcopal Church. He was survived by a son, Strephon Kaplan-Williams, who was raised in boarding schools and hardly ever interacted with his parents. His papers are housed at the Indiana University Lilly Library.\n\n\n\n"}

It has exceptional thermal and chemical stability and does not readily ignite. It was first discovered by American polymer chemist Carl Shipp Marvel in the pursuit of new materials with superior stability, retention of stiffness, toughness at elevated temperature. Due to its high stability, polybenzimidazole is used to fabricate high-performance protective apparel such as firefighter's gear, astronaut space suits, high temperature protective gloves, welders’ apparel and aircraft wall fabrics. Polybenzimidazole has been applied as a membrane in fuel cells.\n\nBrinker and Robinson first reported aliphatic polybenzimidazoles in 1949. However the discovery of aromatic polybenzimidazole which show excellent physical and chemical properties was generally credited to Carl Shipp Marvel in the 1950s. The materials Laboratory of Wright Patterson Air Force Base approached Marvel. They were looking for materials suitable for drogue parachutes which could tolerate short-time mechanical stress. However, the thermal resistance of all known filaments at that time was inadequate. The original search concentrated on aromatic condensation polymers but the amide linkage proved to be weak link for the aim of maximal thermal stability of the polymer, whereas Marvel's research focused on condensation polymers with aromatic and heteroaromatic repeating units. This progressively led to the discovery of polybenzimidazole.\n\nIts development history can be summarized in the following list:\n\nPBI are usually yellow to brown solid infusible up to 400 °C or higher. The solubility of PBI is controversial, because while most of the linear PBI are partly or entirely dissolved in strong protonic acids (for instance, sulfuric acid or methanesulfonic acid), contradictory observations of solubities have been recorded among weaker acids like formic acid, and in non-acidic media, such as the aprotic amide-type solvents and dimethyl sulfoxide. For example, one type of PBI prepared in phosphoric acid was found by Iwakura et al. to be partially soluble in formic acid, but completely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylacetamide, whereas Varma and Veena reported the same polymer type to dissolve completely in formic acid, yet only partially in dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylacetamide.\n\nImidazole derivatives are known to be stable compounds. Many of them are resistant to the most drastic treatments with acids and bases and not easily oxidized. The high decomposition temperature and high stability at over 400 degrees suggests a polymer with benzimidazole as the repeating unit may also show high heat stability.\nPolybenzimidazole and its aromatic derivatives can withstand temperatures in excess of about 500 degrees without softening and degrading. The polymer synthesized from isophthalic acid and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine is not melted by exposure to a temperature of 770 degrees and loses only 30% of its weight after exposure to high temperature up to 900 degrees for several hours.\n\nA property of a material needed to be considered before putting it into application is flammability, which demonstrates how easily one material can ignite and combust under the realistic operating conditions. This may affect its application in varied areas, such as in construction, plant design, and interior decoration. A number of quantitative assessments of flammability exist, such as limiting oxygen index(LOI), i.e., the minimum oxygen concentration at which a given sample can be induced to burn in a candle like configuration. These permit estimation of a 'ranking' comparison of flammability. Data show that PBI are highly flame resistant material compared to common polymers.\n\nPBI's moisture regain is useful in protective clothing; this makes the clothing comfortable to wear, in sharp contrast to other synthetic polymers. The moisture regain ability of PBI (13%) compares favorably with cotton (16%).\n\nThe preparation of PBI(IV) can be achieved by condensation reaction of diphenyl isophthalate (I) and 3,3’,4,4’-tetraaminodiphenyl (II) (Figure 1). The spontaneous cyclization of the intermediately formed animo-amide (III) to PBI (IV) provided a much more stable amide linkage.This synthetic method was first used in the lab and later developed into a two step process. In a typical condition, starting materials were heated at 270 degree for 1.5 h to form the PBI prepolymer and later the prepolymer was heated at 360 degree for another 1 h to form the final commercial-grade product. The reason for the second step is due to the formation of the by-product phenol and water in the first step creating voluminous foam, which leads to the volume expansion of several times of the original. This is the issue that must be considered by the industrial manufacturers. \nThis foam can be reduced by conducting the polycondensation at a high temperature around 200 °C and under the pressure of 2.1-4.2 MPa. The foam can also be controlled by adding high boiling point liquids such as diphenylether or cetane to the polycondesation. The boiling point can make the liquid stay in the first stage of polycondesation but evaporate in the second stage of solid condensation. The disadvantage of this method is that there are still some liquids which remain in PBI and it is hard to remove them completely.\n\nWhile changing the tetramine and acid, a number of different aromatic poly benzimidazoles have been synthesized. The following table (Table 1) lists out some of the combination possibilities that have been synthesized in the literature. Some of the combination have actually been translated into fibers on a small scale. However, the only significant progress have been made to date is PBI.\nThe most common form of PBI used in industry is the fiber form. The fiber process following polymerization is shown in the figure. The polymer is made into solution using dimethylacetamide as solvent. The solution is filtered and converted into fiber using a high temperature dry-spinning process. The fiber is subsequently drawn at elevated temperature to get desired mechanical properties. It is then sulfonated and made into staple using conventional crimping and cutting techniques.\nBefore the 1980s, the major applications of PBI were fire-blocking, thermal protective apparel, and reverse osmosis membranes. Its applications became various by the 1990s when molded PBI parts and microporous membranes were developed.\n\nThe thermal stability, flame resistance, and moisture regain of PBI and its conventional textile processing character enable it to be processed on conventional staple fiber textile equipment. These characteristics lead to one of the most important applications of PBI: protective apparel. PBI filaments were fabricated into protective clothing like firefighters' gear and astronauts' suits. PBI filaments are dry spun from dimethylacetamide containing lithium chloride. After washing and drying the resulting yarn is golden brown. \n\nPBI fiber is an excellent candidate for applications in severe environments due to its combination of thermal, chemical and textile properties. Flame and thermal resistance are the critical properties of protective apparel. This kind of apparel applications includes firefighter's protective apparel, astronaut's suits, aluminized crash rescued gear, industrial worker's apparel, and suits for racing car drivers. \nPBI-blended fabrics have been the preferred choice of active fire departments across the Americas and around the world for over 30 years. From New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Seattle, Nashville to São Paulo, Belin, Hong Kong and many more. Recognized as the leading brand of high-performance protective fabrics, PBI outer shells are selected when fire departments seek increased thermal protection and durability. The high decomposition temperature at which PBI starts to degrade is 1300 °F, far exceeding Nomex/Kevlar blends (Nomex being at 700 °F and Kevlar at 1100 °F), thus offering superior break-open and thermal protection. That's the reason why more firefighters in North America are protected by PBI fabrics than any other fabrics and they hold leading market shares in North-America, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nPBI has been used as the membranes for various separation purposes. Traditionally, PBI was used semi-permeable membranes for electrodialysis, reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration. PBI has also used for gas separations. due to its close chain packing since PBI has rigidity structure and strong hydrogen bonding. PBI membranes are dense, with very low gas permeability. To be proton conductive, PBI usually is doped with acid. The higher level of the acid doping, the more conductive PBI is. But one problem raised is the mechanical strength of PBI decreases at the same time. The optimum doping level is thus a compromise between these two effects. Thus, multiple methods such as ionic cross-linking, covlant cross-linking and composite membranes have been researched to optimize the doping level at which PBI has an improved conductivity without sacrificing mechanical strength. Sulfonated partially fluorinated arylene main chain polymer exhibit good thermal and extended stability, high proton conductivities, less acid swelling, reasonable mechanical strength.\n\nPBI resin is molded via a sintering process that was jointly developed by Hoechst Celanese (North Carolina, USA) and Alpha Precision Plastics, Inc. (Houston, Texas, USA). Molded PBI resin is an excellent candidate for high strength, low weight material. Since it has the highest compressive strength, 58 ksi, of any available, unfilled resin and other mechanical properties such as a tensile strength of 23 ksi, a flexural strength of 32 ksi, a ductile compressive failure mode and the density of 1.3 g/cm3. Moreover, its thermal and electrical properties also make it a well known thermoplastic resin. The PBI resin comprises a recurring structural unit represented by the following figure.\n\nAccording to the Composite Materials Research Group at the University of Wyoming, PBI resin parts maintain significant tensile properties and compressive strength to . PBI resin parts are also potential materials for the chemical process and oil recovery industries which have demands of thermal stability and chemical resistance. In these areas, PBI resin has been successfully applied in demanding sealing, for instance, valve seats, stem seals, hydraulic seals and backup rings. In the aerospace industry, PBI resin has high strength and short term high temperature resistance advantages. In the industrial sector, PBI resin's high dimensional stability as well as retention of electrical properties at high temperature make it used as a thermal and electrical insulator.\n\nPolybenzimidazole is able to be complexed by strong acids because of its basic character. Complexation by phosphoric acid makes it a proton conductive material. This renders the possible application to high temperature fuel cells. Cell performance test show a good stability in performance for 200 h runs at 150 degree. However, gel PBI membranes made in the PPA Process show good stability for greater than 17,000 hours at 160 degrees Celsius. Application in direct methanol fuel cells may be also of interest because of a better selectivity water/methanol compared to existing membranes. Wainright, Wang et al. reported that PBI doped with phosphoric acid was utilized as a high temperature fuel cell electrolyte. The doped PBI high temperature fuel cell electrolyte has several advantages. The elevated temperature increases the kinetic rates of the fuel cell reactions. It also can reduce the problem of the catalyst poisoning by adsorbed carbon monoxide and it minimizes problems due to electrode flooding. PBI/HPO is conductive even in low relative humidity and it allows less crossover of the methanol at the same time. These contribute PBI/HPO to be superior to some traditional polymer electrolytes such as Nafion. Additionally, PBI/HPO maintains good mechanical strength and toughness. Its modulus is three order of magnitudes greater than that of Nafion. This means that the thinner films can be used, thus reducing ohmic loss.\nPreviously, only asbestos can perform well in temperature gloves such as for foundries, aluminum extrusion, and metal treatment, while PBI trials have been developed and show adequately functions as asbestos. Moreover, a safety garment manufacturer reported that gloves containing PBI outlasted asbestos two to nine times with an effective cost. Gloves containing PBI fibers are softer and more supple than those made of asbestos, offering, the worker greater mobility, and comfort even if the fabric becomes charred. Besides, PBI fiber avoids the chronic toxicity problems associated with asbestos because it processes on standard textile and glove fabricating equipment. PBI also can also be a good substitute for asbestos in several areas of glass manufacturing.\n\nPBI's chemical, thermal and physical properties demonstrate that it can be a promising material as a flue gas filter fabric for coal-fired boilers. Few fabrics can survive in the acidic and high temperature environment encountered in coal-fired boiler flue gas. The filter bags also must be able to bear the abrasion from the periodic cleaning to remove accumulated dust. PBI fabric has a good abrasion resistance property. The acid and abrasion resistance and thermal stability properties make PBI a competitor for this application.\n\nThe chemical formula of poly[2,2’-(m-phenylen)-5,5’ bibenzimidazol] (PBI) is believed to be:\n([NH-C=CH-C=CH-CH=C-N=C-]-[C=CH-C=CH-CH=CH-]) OR (CNH) of Molar mass 308.336 ± 0.018 g/mol.\n\nIt is dyeable to dark shades with basic dyes following caustic pretreatment and resistant to most chemicals.\n\nFeatures low electrical conductivity and low static electricity buildup.\n\nFeatures abrasion resistance.\n\nAdditional features: will not ignite or smolder (burn slowly without flame), mildew- and age-resistant, resistant to sparks and welding spatter.\n\nOther features: continuous temperature: , does not melt but degrades around the temperature: under pyrolysis, retains fiber integrity and suppleness up to .\n\n"}

Project banner, for whom he has written and produced the vast majority of their chart-topping hits. He has also produced music for other Japanese artists, including Ayumi Hamasaki's . As his musical influences he cites The Beatles, Japanese popular music (especially kayōkyoku), American and European hits being played on the radio when he was a schoolboy, disco acts such as Chic, Kool & the Gang and Earth, Wind & Fire, and bands like Duran Duran and The Power Station.\n\nIn June 2006, Tsunku married , a 25-year-old former model from Fukuoka. The couple have fraternal twins (one boy, one girl) born in 2008 and one daughter who was born in 2011.\n\nTsunku later worked with Nintendo and J.P.ROOM to create the music video game, Rhythm Tengoku. It was released for the Game Boy Advance exclusively in Japan on August 3, 2006, and later as an arcade machine on September 20, 2007. He also worked on \"Rhythm Tengoku Gold\" (Released in the US as \"Rhythm Heaven\" and in Europe as \"Rhythm Paradise\") for the Nintendo DS, \"Minna no Rhythm Tengoku\" (\"Rhythm Heaven Fever\" in the US, Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise in Europe) for the Wii, and Rhythm Tengoku: The Best Plus (\"Rhythm Heaven Megamix\" in the US, \"Rhythm Paradise Megamix\" in Europe) for the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nOn October 1, 2006, it was announced that Tsunku had created a new company called TNX consisting of singers such as Ami Tokito and other people including Tatsuya Naka, a magician who appeared on Hello! Morning.\n\nOn September 26, 2007, Tsunku released a compilation album with the temporary title of \"\"Sharam Q ~ Morning Musume\" ~Tsunku 15 Years in Entertainment Commemoration Album~\", containing songs by both Sharam Q and Morning Musume, and another one on December 5, 2007 titled \"Tsunku Best Work Collection\", containing songs sung by Tsunku himself.\n\nTsunku is responsible for majority of the musical composition and lyrics in Hello! Project, noticeably for Morning Musume where all of their singles have ranked in the Oricon Weekly Singles Top 5 (excluding \"Morning Coffee\" and \"Mikan\"). Arranging is typically left to outside parties with track records in arranging popular anime and game music.\n\nHis works are mainly pop-oriented with catchy melodies and romantic, idealistic and sometimes even humorous lyrics, the latter in particular often being pitched to appeal to a young audience. However, many of the female vocalists who perform his songs have a large, dedicated fan base composed of older male wota, as well as male fans who are \"not\" wota, both of whom are usually in their twenties and thirties, and occasionally older. Some of his works in the late 2000s were particularly mature and hard-hitting (considering the ages of the girls singing them), such as the Morning Musume singles \"Kanashimi Twilight, \"Onna ni Sachi Are\" and \"Resonant Blue\". Although his own work as a soloist and in Sharam Q tends to lean towards pop-rock, he is best known for working with various arrangers to create highly melodic, richly-textured sequencer-driven electronic dance music which often features synthesizers, as well as guitar riffs and solos which sometimes hint at hard rock or heavy metal influences (such as in Morning Musume's \"Ambitious! Yashinteki de Ii Jan\" and Cute's \"Forever Love\"). Typical vocal arrangements in the songs he writes for Hello! Project's groups tend to revolve around the members taking turns at singing lines and sometimes even small parts of lines in succession, building up to a chorus in which most (if not all) members sing in unison rather than using vocal harmonies; any harmonies that \"are\" present in the songs are often sung by other people (including Tsunku himself, who records his backing vocals so as to appear to sing \"along with\" the girls on their studio recordings during key parts of songs such as during choruses and on certain phrases, in a voice an octave lower than theirs). However, there have been some exceptions, such as the Morning Musume songs \"Morning Coffee\", \"Furusato\", \"Memory Seishun no Hikari\", \"Love Machine\" and \"I Wish\", where most (if not all) of the backing vocals were sung by the group's members themselves. Furthermore, in the past few years, it has become even more common for members of Hello! Project's groups to provide the backing vocals for their songs themselves.\n\nRecent years have also seen Hello! Project moving in a new direction musically, with prominent elements of dubstep and electro being incorporated into much of their recorded output, resulting in songs which seem at times to be almost experimental in style, at least by idol music standards.\n\nTsunku is also involved in .\n\nAs a result of the Japanese earthquake 2011, Tsunku wrote a song titled \"Love is here ~Kibou no Hikari~\", dedicated to the victims.

He also stated that he has been seeking treatment for it. On April 4, 2015, Tsunku revealed that he had his vocal cords removed as part of his cancer treatment.\n\nIn his memoir, \"Dakara, Ikiru\", which was published in September 2015, it was revealed that he stepped down as Hello! Project's General Manager sometime after Morning Musume's New York concert that happened on October 5, 2014. He still remains involved with Morning Musume as its Sound Producer.\n\nOn May 4, 2020, Tsunku was among the 121 members of Up-Front Group to participate in a YouTube telework to support the frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n"}

After the formation, the group immediately released their first single, \"Last Kiss,\" which was used on the anime \"Sorcerous Stabber Orphen\". The single has a \"sexy\" vibe that they used on their second single and first album. However, they created a fresh image when they released \"Tanpopo\".

The style of their songs changed also when the four released \"Otome Pasta ni Kandō.\" The style of this song became analogous to the songs Morning Musume had released. They also used this style on their next singles, which became popular and reached the number one spot on Oricon, and their second (and last) album.\n\nOn July 31, 2002, it was announced that Tanpopo was going to be completely reformed. Kaori Iida, Mari Yaguchi, and Ai Kago graduated from the group and were replaced by Morning Musume 5th Generation members Asami Konno and Risa Niigaki, with Ayumi Shibata of Melon Kinenbi. This newly formed group only released one single before they went on indefinite hiatus. All members except Niigaki graduated from Hello! Project as part of the Elder Club graduation concert in early 2009, rendering the group completely inactive.\n\nIn 2009, the Tanpopo name was revived as Tanpopo# (read \"Tanpopo Sharp\"), with the new group consisting of Eri Kamei and Aika Mitsui of Morning Musume, Yurina Kumai of Berryz Kobo, and Chisato Okai of Cute. The sharp symbol was chosen to represent the kanji \"井\", read \"i\", which is the second character in each of the new members' surnames. Their first song was a cover of Seiko Matsuda's \"Akai Sweet Pea\", released on the \"Champloo 1: Happy Marriage Song Cover Shū\" album. Their next song, \"Umbrella\", was released on the \"Petit Best 10\" album.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The registration identifier is a numeric or alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies the vehicle within the issuing authority's database. In Europe most countries have adopted a format for number plates that satisfies the requirements in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which states that cross-border vehicles must display a distinguishing code for the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may be an oval sticker placed separately from the registration plate, or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organisation to which the country belongs. An example of such format is the common EU format, with the EU flag above the country code issued in EU member states.\n\nThe vast majority of European countries issue registration plates that are:\n\n\nThis is one of the basic standard sizes worldwide.\n\nThe others are:\n\n\nSome European countries use registration plates in other formats: \n\n\nThe common EU format of having a blue section on the extreme left with EU circle of stars and the country code was introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 2411/98 of 3 November 1998 and entered into force on the 11 November 1998. It was based on a model registration plate which three member states had already introduced: Ireland (1991), Portugal (1992) and Germany (1994). Luxembourg plates had displayed the EU flag on the left since 1988. Vehicles with EU number plates do not need to display the white oval international vehicle registration code while within the European Economic Area or in countries signatory to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. \n\n\nSeveral non-EU European states have implemented formats similar to the EU format, with national flags or symbols in place of the circle of stars. Vehicles with such number plates, issued in countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, do not need to display the white oval international vehicle registration code while within countries signatory to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.\n\n\nSeveral countries have made efforts to avoid duplicating registration numbers used by other countries.

According to Article 3 of the regulation shall member states that require vehicles registered in another member state to display a distinguishing registration sign also recognize distinguishing signs issued in accordance with the regulation (the common EU format). After the amendment of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic in 2006, registration plates issued in the common EU format also satisfies the requirements of the named convention and hence is also valid in all countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. \n\nAfter Brexit, The European Commission has confirmed that after Brexit, British cars with number plates with the distinguishing sign incorporated do not need a separate sign when driving in EU countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. If the number plate does not include the distinguishing sign, or if the vehicle is driven in an EU country not party to the Vienna Convention, a separate sign has to be displayed at the rear of the vehicle. All EU countries except Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Spain are party to the convention. \nSome European countries are not party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. Ireland, Cyprus, Iceland and Malta are examples of non-signatory countries. Those who have not ratified the convention may be parties to the older 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, which is the case of the aforementioned countries. According to the Geneva convention, a distinguishing sign of the country of registration must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. This sign must be placed separately from the registration plate and may not be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate.\n\nVehicle registration plates of each country are described in the following table:\n\nMotorcycle plates are used for motorcycles and vehicles where mounting space is an issue, such as taxis which display their registration plate beside the registration plate, and vehicles imported from countries where the mounting space was not originally designed to take European-sized plates (e.g. USA).\n\n"}

It is fourth entry in Hammer's \"Dracula\" series, and the third to feature Christopher Lee as Count Dracula, the titular vampire. The film stars Rupert Davies as a clergyman who exorcises Dracula's castle, and in doing so, unwittingly resurrects the Count back from the dead.\n\n\"Dracula Has Risen from the Grave\" also stars Veronica Carlson, Barry Andrews, Barbara Ewing, Ewan Hooper and Michael Ripper. It was followed by \"Taste the Blood of Dracula\" in 1970.\n\nThe story opens in 1905 in an East European village. A young altar boy (Norman Bacon) makes his way up to the bell-tower. He is about to ring the bell when blood drips on his cheek from above. He climbs into the bell chamber, where he discovers the corpse of a young woman crammed inside the church bell, another victim of Dracula.\n\nA year later in 1906, following the events of the previous film, Dracula has been destroyed. Monsignor Ernest Mueller (Rupert Davies) comes to the village on a routine visit only to find the altar boy is now a frightened mute and the priest (Ewan Hooper) has lost his faith. The villagers refuse to attend Mass at the Catholic church because the shadow of Dracula's castle touches it. To bring to an end the villagers' fears, Mueller climbs to the castle to exorcise it.\n\nThe terrified priest follows only partway up the mountain, and Mueller continues alone. As he exorcises the castle, attaching a large metal cross to its gate, a thunderstorm occurs. The priest flees, stumbles, and is knocked unconscious when his head strikes a rock. The blood from the head wound trickles into a frozen stream through a crack in the ice, and onto the lips of Count Dracula, reviving him. Mueller returns to the village, reassures the villagers, and returns to his home city of Keinenberg where he lives with his widowed sister-in-law, Anna (Marion Mathie).\n\nUnknown to Mueller, Dracula takes control of the priest. Furious that his castle is now barred to him, Dracula forces the enslaved priest to reveal the name of the exorcist. The priest desecrates a coffin to provide a sleeping place for the Count, and leads Dracula to Keinenberg, where the Count determines to take his revenge on Mueller's beautiful niece, Maria (Veronica Carlson). Dracula enslaves Zena the tavern girl (Barbara Ewing). Zena almost succeeds in bringing Maria under Dracula's power, but Maria's boyfriend Paul (Barry Andrews), who lives and works in the bakery beneath the tavern, rescues her. Dracula punishes Zena by killing her. Dracula orders the priest to destroy Zena's corpse before she turns into a vampire, so the priest burns her body in the bakery ovens. The priest then helps Dracula locate Maria. Dracula climbs over the rooftops of nearby buildings, enters Maria's room, and bites her.\n\nMueller enters Maria's room just after Dracula has bitten the girl and pursues a fleeing figure across the rooftops. He is knocked down by the priest. Mueller makes his way back home, where his sister-in-law cares for him. He summons Paul, knowing that he will help protect Maria because of his love for her. He passes on a book, which contains the rites of protection against vampires and ways to defeat them, before he succumbs to his wounds. Paul enlists the priest, not knowing he is under Dracula's spell. Unable to break free from Dracula's influence, the priest attacks Paul one night as they watch over Maria. Paul defeats the priest, and forces him to lead the way to Dracula's lair. They try to stake Dracula through the heart, but the faithless priest and the atheist Paul are not able to say the required prayer, so Dracula rises and removes the stake himself. He kidnaps Maria and flees to Castle Dracula, pursued by Paul and the priest.\n\nAt the castle, Dracula orders Maria to remove the cross from the door. She throws it over the parapet into the ravine below. Paul fights Dracula on the parapet and throws him over the side, followed by Dracula's impaling on the cross below. The priest, freed from the vampire's influence, recites the Lord's Prayer in Latin and Count Dracula perishes, dissolving into dust. Reunited with Maria and having apparently regained his Christian faith, Paul crosses himself while viewing Dracula's remains.\n\n\nThis Hammer Dracula production was shot at Pinewood Studios situated in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Missing are the approach road, coach path and moat seen in front of Castle Dracula in \"Dracula\" (1958) and \"\" (1966). Those films were made at Bray Studios.\n\nThe film was photographed by Arthur Grant using colored filters belonging to director Freddie Francis, also a cameraman, who used them when photographing \"The Innocents\" (1961). Whenever Dracula (or his castle) is in a scene, the frame edges are tinged crimson, amber and yellow. Initially Terence Fisher was to direct the film, but dropped out due to illness; Freddie Francis stepped in.\n\nIn Australia, the film was the first Hammer Dracula to be passed by the censors; the previous films \"Dracula\" and \"Dracula: Prince of Darkness\" were banned. The film was slightly censored and ran for a three-week season at Sydney's Capitol theater in January 1970.\n\nHoward Thompson of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"\"Dracula Has Risen From The Grave.\" Yes, again. And judging by this junky British film in color—asplatter with catchup or paint or whatever, to simulate the Count's favorite color—he can descend again.\" \"Variety\" called the film \"a tired episode,\" adding, \"The story's slight, the horror and the bloodcurdling essential to these pix is minimal and even Dracula himself appears bored at being resurrected yet again.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" of the UK was somewhat more positive, writing that the film was \"rather short on shock sequences\" but had \"a nice gory opening\" and \"a suitably horrific finale.\" Audiences in both Britain and the U.S. applauded the movie, which became Hammer's highest-grossing film. \n\n\"The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films\" called the film \"a minor triumph of style over content\", writing that the film \"succeeds by virtue of Francis' adventurous direction\". The film currently holds 80% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nOn 6 November 2007, the film was released as part of a DVD four-pack along with \"Dracula\", \"Taste the Blood of Dracula\", and \"Dracula A.D. 1972\".\n\nOn 6 October 2015, the film was released on Blu-ray as part of a Hammer collection pack with \"The Mummy\", \"Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed\", and \"Taste the Blood of Dracula\". It was also released on Blu-ray separately.\n\n\n"}

The film is the fifth in a series of Hammer films focusing on Baron Frankenstein, who, in this entry, terrorises those around him in a bid to uncover the secrets of a former associate confined to a lunatic asylum.\n\nWhile illegally procuring a brain for his next experiment, Baron Victor Frankenstein finds a thief when he returns to his lab. He destroys most of the evidence and moves on, with a haughty police inspector on his trail. He obtains a room at a boarding house run by Anna Spengler, whose fiancé Karl Holst is a doctor at the local insane asylum where a former scientific collaborator of the Baron's, Dr. Brandt, who has lost his mind, now resides.\n\nAfter discovering that Karl has been stealing narcotics in order to support Anna's ailing mother, Frankenstein blackmails them into helping him to obtain surgical supplies and kidnap Dr. Brandt so he can operate on his brain and cure him, thereby allowing the Baron to obtain his discovery of successful brain transplantation. Frankenstein and Karl kidnap Brandt, but he suffers a heart attack during the escape, necessitating a transfer of his brain into another body. The Baron and Karl then kidnap the asylum's director Professor Richter and transplants Brandt's brain into the Professor's body.\n\nFrankenstein and Karl bury Brandt's body in the garden, but a water main break almost gives up the game. The police start searching every house in the area in their search for the missing men. Brandt's wife recognises the Baron on the street, but he is able to convince her to give him time to cure her husband. After she leaves, Frankenstein forces Karl and Anna to help him escape with the Brandt-Richter creature.\n\nWhile Brandt recovers, Frankenstein and the lovers relocate to a deserted manor house as the police begin to close in. In the lab, the creature awakens and is horrified by his appearance. He scares Anna, who stabs him, causing him to escape. Frankenstein returns and finds the creature gone. In a rage, he murders Anna and goes after the creature. The creature makes it to his former home, but his wife refuses to accept him as her husband. Wanting revenge on Frankenstein, and knowing the Baron will eventually track him there, he allows his wife to go free. He then starts pouring paraffin over the house.\n\nFrankenstein soon arrives, with Karl following, and the creature makes fires around the house to trap him. Frankenstein finds the papers of discovery and flees the house, but Karl ambushes him, and they fight. The creature emerges and carries a screaming Frankenstein into the burning house.\n\n\nThe scene where Frankenstein rapes Anna was filmed over the objections of both Peter Cushing and Veronica Carlson, and director Terence Fisher, who halted it when he felt enough was enough. It was not in the original script, but the scene was added at the insistence of Hammer executive James Carreras, who was under pressure to keep the American distributors happy. This explains why there is no mention of the rape subsequently by Anna or Frankenstein.\n\nThe scenes featuring Thorley Walters as Inspector Frisch were also late additions to the original script; they have been described as unnecessary, adding an unwelcome element of comedy into the suspenseful story and also making the film too long.\n\nIn 1978, the Welsh television station HTV Cymru/Wales broadcast a version dubbed into the Welsh language called \"Rhaid Dinistrio Frankenstein\", a more-or-less literal translation of the English title. This was one of three films that were dubbed into Welsh, another being \"Shane\", with Alan Ladd. Both these were rebroadcast on the new Welsh language channel S4C on its launch in 1982.\n\n\"Variety\" called the film \"a good-enough example of its low-key type, with artwork rather better than usual (less obvious backcloths, etc.) a minimum of artless dialogue, good lensing by Arthur Grant and a solid all round cast.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" called it \"the most spirited Hammer horror in some time. The crudities still remain, of course, but the talk of transplants and drugs seem to have injected new life into the continuing story of Baron Frankenstein.\"\n\"Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed\" currently holds an average 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\n"}

Sans Souci is 17 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and lies across the local government areas of the Bayside Council and the Georges River Council. It is part of the St George area.\n\nSans Souci sits on the western shore of Botany Bay. Lady Robinsons Beach and Cook Park run along the eastern border. Kogarah Bay runs along the western border. Sans Souci is connected to Taren Point, in the Sutherland Shire, to the south, by the Captain Cook Bridge over the Georges River.\n\nSans Souci is a French term meaning \"without care\", in other terms, \"no worries\". The area between Cooks River and Georges River was originally known as Seven Mile Beach. It was changed to Lady Robinson’s Beach in 1874 to honour the wife of Governor Sir Hercules Robinson. Cook Park is named after Samuel Cook, who advocated it as a public pleasure area.\n\nCatherine Cooper was given a grant in the area in 1830, where she and husband, Robert Cooper Junior, built a home. The Coopers later operated a distillery there; the land was known as Charlotte Point and then Rocky Point. \n\nSans Souci took its name from a grand house built on Rocky Point Road on land bought in 1853, by Thomas Holt (1811–1888), a wool merchant and politician, for his German wife. It was named after Sanssouci in Potsdam, Germany, the summer palace of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. However, Holt thought that the area was too isolated so he built another house at Marrickville, overlooking the Cooks River, which he called The Warren. He bred rabbits for hunting and kept exotic animals, including an alpaca on this property. In the 1860s, Holt sold his Sans Souci property to William Rust, who turned it into a popular hotel, despite its isolation.\n\nA steam tram operated between Sans Souci and Kogarah in the 1890s which allowed people to enjoy bathing, boating and fishing. In 1937, a silent electric trolley bus was introduced that, until 1959, ran from Rockdale to Kogarah, Sans Souci and Dolls Point.\n\nThis steam tramway opened in 1887, and was replaced by an electric trolleybus service in 1937. It connected with trains at Kogarah station by way of a large balloon loop through the streets, then passed south down Rocky Point Road to Sans Souci, Sandringham and Dolls Point. Small depots at Sandringham and Kogarah serviced the line. The line was single track at each end with a double-track middle section down Rocky Point Road.\n\nSans Souci is a mostly residential area. A shopping strip is located on Rocky Point Road, near the intersection of Sandringham St, including the Sans Souci Shopping Village, The Party People, various fast food outlets and the post office. Another small group of shops is located at the intersection of Clareville Avenue and Russell Avenue, on the border with Dolls Point and Sandringham. It includes Sans Souci Library and a variety of small shops and retailers. Two primary schools are located in the suburb: Sans Souci Public and St Finbars.\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2016 census, there were 10,304 people usually reside in Sans Souci. 63.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Greece 4.0%, China 2.5%, Egypt 2.3%, England 1.8% and New Zealand 1.5%. 55.9% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 13.4%, Arabic 4.7%, Mandarin 2.4%, Macedonian 2.2% and Italian 1.9%.

The character of Hulot (although played by another actor) also appears briefly in François Truffaut's \"Bed & Board\" (1970).\n\nHe is recognized by his overcoat, pipe and hat, and his distinctive lurching walk. He is clumsy and somewhat naive of the evolving world around him, but still has a friendly, well-meaning, and good-natured persona. His escapades usually involved clashes with technology and the problems of living in an increasingly impersonal and gadgetized world. In \"Trafic\", Hulot, the designer of a new camper-car, \"struggles valiantly… against the perpetual roadblocks of cars, policemen, bureaucrats and just people\".\n\nThe name of \"Monsieur Hulot\" is believed to echo \"Charlot,\" the French name for Charlie Chaplin’s character The Tramp. However, \"Hulot is more distracted than the Tramp, he cannot disentangle himself from situations as effortlessly, and he is not as central a character, he is not ‘the reason for the film.'\" As theorized by David Bellos, Hulot may even represent an inversion of The Tramp: “Hulot tilts forwards whereas Chaplin tilts back; Chaplin’s puppet-like waddle is very different from Hulot’s ‘springy glide’; and there is a difference in costume too: the bowler, tails, huge pants, cane and cigarette are replaced by a pipe, various accessories, pants that are too short, a sports blazer and a Homburg, although the striped socks are borrowed from Keaton.” \n\nOf Hulot, Jacques Tati has remarked that he is “tall, and he cannot hide –he cannot conceal himself behind a lamppost or anything else –whereas Chaplin could hide behind a small trash can, leave his hat on the can, then sneak behind another small can, while making people believe that he was still in back of the first one, whereupon he would come back to grab his hat. Hulot, by contrast, has the stature of a rather steady or stand-up guy; he behaves exactly like any man from Paris or even from the provinces.”\n\nFilm critic Michel Chion has written that:\nHulot is the guy you recognize because he was in the same barracks as you, even though he never became a close friend. He gives you the illusion of familiarity, which really doesn’t exist. He develops into a real person only when you bump into him by accident one night... By creating Hulot, Tati aims to re-establish a distance. From the start, Hulot is someone who exists only in the eyes and mouths of the beholder. He is someone who awakens suspicion or amused attention... Hulot is a blurred man, a passer-by, a \"Hulotus errans\".\n\nThis view is shared by Roger Ebert, who, in his review of \"Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot\", states that Hulot “is friendly to a fault, but he is the man nobody quite sees. The holidaymakers are distracted by their own worlds, companions, and plans, and notice Hulot only when something goes wrong, as it often does.” English comedian Rowan Atkinson has cited Hulot as an influence for his character, Mr. Bean.\n"}

{"id": "2035204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035204", "title": "Face of Boe", "text": "Face of Boe\n\nThe Face of Boe is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". Not portrayed on-screen by an actor, the Face of Boe is a wholly mechanical effect, resembling a gigantic human-like head with a weathered face and in place of hair, numerous tendrils which terminate in round pod-like structures. Typically it is encased in a clear sealed container and mounted on a movable pedestal base.\n\nThe Face merely grunted during his first appearance, in \"The End of the World\", before communicating telepathically in \"New Earth\" and \"Gridlock\", the former of which it also spoke for the first and last time in the latter, and was voiced by Struan Rodger. It is stated in \"New Earth\" that he is thought to be millions of years old (billions, at least according to \"Gridlock\"); however, when this was suggested to him, he responded with a leading question concerning the impossibility of such an age.\n\nIt was suggested in \"Last of the Time Lords\" that the Face of Boe could be a future Jack Harkness.\n\nThe Doctor has encountered the Face of Boe (as originally presented) three times. In \"The End of the World\" (2005), set five billion years in the future, the Face of Boe sponsored the safe viewing of Earth's destruction by the expansion of the Sun. The event was sabotaged, but the Face of Boe survived along with most of the guests, thanks to the Ninth Doctor's intervention.\n\nIn \"New Earth\" (2006), the Face of Boe is apparently dying of old age in a New New York hospital in the year five billion and twenty-three. His nurse, one of the Sisters of Plenitude, Novice Hame, tells the Tenth Doctor that the sleeping Face sometimes sings \"ancient songs\", which she hears telepathically, and relates the legend that, just before dying, the Face will reveal his greatest secret to \"one like himself\", \"a wanderer without a home\", \"a lonely god\" (such as the Doctor). When the Doctor later asks the Face of Boe about the legend, the Face of Boe claims that the \"great secret\" can wait for their third and final meeting, and enigmatically teleports away to an unspecified destination.\n\nThe Face of Boe's ostensible last appearance is in \"Gridlock\" (2007), in the year five billion and fifty-three, some time after a drug-induced plague has wiped out almost all life on New Earth. He had been using his life force to power the undercity of New New York, which was sealed off from the rest of the planet to save the only survivors from the now-extinct virus. The Face of Boe needed the Doctor's help to free the people from the undercity, and he uses the last of his life energy to provide a power boost to unseal the exits. As was foretold in legend, initially introduced in spin-off media, the sky (of the undercity) splits asunder just before the Face of Boe dies. In his final moments, the Face of Boe reveals his great secret to the Doctor: \"You are not alone.\" The Doctor tells his companion, Martha Jones, that the Face of Boe must be mistaken, but it is later revealed that there is indeed another Time Lord — the Master has survived the Time War.\n\nIn the episode \"The End of the World\", the Face of Boe is described as a being of considerable influence in galactic circles and is identified as coming from the \"Silver Devastation\". In \"Bad Wolf\", set in the 2002nd century, he is said to be \"the oldest being in the Isop galaxy\" (the location of the planet Vortis in \"The Web Planet\"). In \"The Long Game\", set 100 years earlier (the Face's youngest appearance), a TV network reports that he is pregnant with the \"Baby Boemina\", though the credibility of Satellite 5's news reporting is taken into question in the episode as well. In \"New Earth\", it is stated that the Face of Boe is the last of his species, the \"Boekind\" having died off long before. The Doctor also makes a comment that the Face of Boe is possibly over five billion years old.\n\nIn the episode \"Last of the Time Lords\", the immortal time traveller Captain Jack Harkness expresses concern about how he might look if he lives \"for a million years\", because although he cannot die, he is still aging, albeit slowly. He tells the Doctor and Martha Jones that it is a matter of vanity, because as the first person from the Boeshane Peninsula to join the Time Agency, he was featured on posters, becoming known as \"the Face of Boe\".\n\nWriter Russell T Davies, in the episode's commentary, called the implication of this scene \"a theory\" as to the Face of Boe's origins, prompting Executive Producer Julie Gardner to urge him to \"stop back-pedalling\" about the two characters being the same. Davies also said that after writing the scene he inserted a line in the ADR recording for \"Gridlock\" in which the Face of Boe calls the Doctor \"old friend\". Davies does not like making the relationship between Jack and Boe explicit, stating \"the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies\". He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two.\n\n"}

They were written over a period of almost 60 years and can be divided into three distinct groups: literary criticism, personal beliefs and cultural criticism.\n\nHesse's earliest essays revolve around narrow literary topics but become more philosophical and political in the 1920s to 1930s and finally the reflections of a man who has retreated from the strife of dialectics and now deals with such matters with greater detachment.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, only a few of Hesse's essays have been available in English. \"The Brothers Karamazov, or The Decline of Europe\" and \"Thoughts on The Idiot by Dostoevsky\" were translated to English by Sydney Schiff and published in 1923 under the title \"In Sight of Chaos\".

The claimed territory is part of the natural reserve of Kullaberg in southern Sweden.\n\nIn 1980, artist Lars Vilks began construction of two sculptures, \"Nimis\" (Latin for \"too much\", a structure made of 75 tonnes of driftwood) and \"Arx\" (Latin for \"fortress\", a structure made of stone), in the Kullaberg nature reserve in north-west Skåne, Sweden. The location of the sculptures is difficult to reach, and as a consequence they were not discovered for two years, at which point the local council declared the sculptures to be buildings, the construction of which was forbidden on the nature reserve, and demanded that they should be dismantled and removed. Despite the confrontations with the local council, a large percentage of the local community supports the sculptures, especially people working in the tourism industry.\n\nVilks appealed the decision of the council, but lost. He appealed repeatedly, and finally the case was settled, in the council's favour, by the Swedish government. However, in the meantime Nimis had been bought from Vilks by the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude after the death of Joseph Beuys, who bought it in 1984. On 2 June 1996, in protest of the local council, Vilks declared the area surrounding Nimis an independent, sovereign country named Ladonia.\n\nIn 1999, another sculpture, Omphalos (named after Omphalos, a small sculpture in the temple at Delphi, \"marking the centre of the world\"), was created. It was made of stone and concrete, 1.61 metres high and weighing a tonne. The Gyllenstiernska Krapperup Foundation, formed to promote art and culture, accused Vilks of building this sculpture and complained to the police, and in August 1999 the district court ordered its removal. The Foundation had also demanded the removal of \"Nimis\" and \"Arx\", but the court ruled against it. The Foundation appealed this decision to the Supreme Court, who eventually ruled against it. The police were unable to positively identify Vilks as the sculptor, but the district court held that he was.\n\nThe removal of Omphalos was itself controversial. Vilks was ordered to find an acceptable way to remove the sculpture. He proposed blowing it up on 10 December 2001, Nobel Day and the 100th anniversary of the Nobel Prize, and applied to the county council for permission to do so. The county council made a decision on 7 December, but kept it secret until 10 December. By that time, another artist, Ernst Billgren, had bought \"Omphalos\" from Vilks, and had requested that it not be damaged. In the early hours of 9 December, a crane boat was sent (by DYKMA, under contract from the Enforcement Administration) to the site and removed the sculpture (at a cost of SEK 92,500, billed to Vilks). Despite the new owner's request, the sculpture was damaged by handling. In response to this, the Enforcement Administration was satirically declared to be \"Performance Artist of the Year\" in 2002.\n\nAfterwards, Vilks applied to the county council again, this time for permission to erect a memorial in the place that \"Omphalos\" had stood. Permission was granted by the council to erect a monument no greater than 8 centimetres high. This was duly done, and the monument was inaugurated on 27 February 2002.\n\nThe ensemble Neurobash performed in Ladonia during the 10th Anniversary celebrations in 2006.\n\nThe government of Ladonia is jointly led by a Queen and a President. The President and Vice-President are elected tri-annually, while the Queen, once crowned, reigns for life. the position of President is held by Interim-President The President's Old Shoes, and the Vice-President position is vacant, pending new elections in 2019. Vilks, the State Secretary, performs or oversees many of the day-to-day operations of the microstate, including processing new citizenship applications and posting photos and news items to the Ladonian online \"newspaper\". The Cabinet Ministers are the legislative body in Ladonia, and they participate in debates and vote on proposals via the Internet. Many Ladonian ministries have artistic connotations and whimsical names.\nAs of 2018 the Cabinet of Ladonia has voted to amend the constitution to create the position of Prime Minister. The PM candidates will be nominated by and selected from current members of the Cabinet. The amendment abolishes the positions of President and Vice-President. This move was made as a way to prevent the election fraud that occurred in the previous election.\n\nWhen it was created, Ladonia had no population. As of 2016, there are 17,752 Ladonian citizens from more than 50 countries. None of the citizens resides within Ladonia's borders, although there has been at least one resident citizen in the past. Ladonia coexists as both a physical territory and as a large and active online community that resembles a third place, distinguishing itself from other micronations, which are either active online communities or claim small physical territories.\n\nA comparison can be drawn between Ladonia accepting online citizenship applications and the E-Residency of Estonia. Virtual residency program shows how established nations may also adopt similar strategies to micronation, providing an example of what citizenship might look like in postnationalism.\n\nNimis is a series of wooden sculptures situated along the coast in the Kullaberg Nature Reserve, Höganäs Municipality, in the northern part of Skåne County, Sweden. They are a massive, wooden labyrinthine structure connected by several wooden towers, and are said to be mostly constructed from driftwood.\n\nThey were begun by the artist Lars Vilks in 1980 and have been the subject of a long-running legal dispute between the Swedish authorities and the artist. As no permission was given to build on the site within the nature reserve, the County Administrative Board in Skåne has sought to have Nimis demolished, despite the fact that it has become a popular tourist attraction.\n\nAs Nimis's existence is not sanctioned by Sweden, it is difficult to find – there are no official sign posts in Sweden, nor is it marked on maps. However, it can be found on Google Maps. It lies a few kilometres northwest of the town of Arild and somewhat farther from the town of Mölle, and can only be reached on foot following a well-worn path with yellow Ns painted on trees and fences. The path begins as an easy stroll past Himmelstorp, a well-preserved eighteenth-century farmstead, but quickly becomes a steep and rocky climb down to the coast. Reportedly, thousands of local and international tourists visit Nimis each year, especially during summer.\n\n\n\n"}

The split occurred after Baháʼí founder Baháʼu'lláh made his claims to be the messiah public in 1866, leading to expressions of support from the majority of the Bábí community, and opposition from Subh-i-Azal, who became the leader of the remaining group.\n\nSiyyid ʻAlí-Muhammad was a merchant from Shiraz, Persia, who at the age of 25, claimed to be a new and independent Manifestation of God, and the promised Qá'im, or Mihdí of Islam.

He later declared that he was not just, 'the Gate', or the Bab, but he was the Qa'im, or Promised One himself.\n\nThe Báb's writings had the concept of the returning messiah called, \"He whom God shall make manifest\".

The Báb was imprisoned and executed by firing squad in Tabriz on July 9, 1850.\n\nIn most of his prominent writings, the Báb alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as \"Him whom God shall make manifest\", and that he himself was \"but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest.\" The Bayán is essentially a discourse on Him whom God shall make manifest, and the Báb always discussed his own writings in the context of the coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Several of the Báb's writings state the coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest would be imminent.\n\nThe Báb eliminated the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his movement, and stated that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until Him Whom God shall make manifest would appear.\n\nHe did, however, appoint a nominal leader after himself. Shortly before the Báb's execution, a follower of the Báb, Abd al-Karim, brought to the Báb's attention the necessity to appoint a leader; thus the Báb wrote a certain number of tablets which he gave to Abd al-Karim to deliver to Subh-i-Azal and Baháʼu'lláh. These tablets were later interpreted by both Azalis and Baháʼís as proof of the Báb's delegation of leadership. Baháʼí sources state that the Báb did this at the suggestion of Baháʼu'lláh.\n\nIn one of the tablets, which is commonly referred to as the \"\"Will and Testament of the Báb\"\", Subh-i-Azal is viewed to have been appointed as leader of the Bábis after the death of the movement's founder; the tablet, in verse 27, also appears to order Subh-i-Azal \"...to obey Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest.\" Multiple versions of this tablet exist, and Browne notes in his translation that this copy of the letter is actually in Subh-i-Azal's handwriting rather than the Báb's. Browne, discussing a visit with Subh-i-Azal in Cyprus, notes that he saw the original document in the Báb's own handwriting.\n\nIn addition to the difficulties of collecting original Bábí documents at such a distance — Browne was at Cambridge — was the widespread Azali practice of \"Taqiyya\" (Dissimulation), or concealing one's beliefs. Browne appears to have been unaware of this. (See Azali Taqiyya (Dissimulation) below.)\n\nSubh-i-Azal's leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the Bábí community spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; and even went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb on several occasions. Subh-i-Azal gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the Bábís who started to give their alliance to other claimants. During the time that both Baháʼu'lláh and Subh-i-Azal were in Baghdad, since Subh-i-Azal remained in hiding, Baháʼu'lláh performed much of the daily administration of the Bábí affairs.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh claimed that in 1852, while a prisoner in Tehran, he was visited by a \"Maid of Heaven\", which symbolically marked the beginning of his mission as a Messenger of God. In 1863 as he was leaving Baghdad in the Garden of Ridván, he made his first public declaration to be Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest, the messianic figure in the Báb's writings, to a small number of followers. This declaration started a new phase of leadership in the Bábí community that would eventually lead to the emergence of the Baháʼí Faith as a separate movement distinct from Bábism. While in Adrianople (current-day Edirne, Turkey), Baháʼu'lláh was the clear leader of the newly established Bábí community, and a permanent break between Baháʼu'lláh and Subh-i-Azal occurred.\n\nIn 1865 Subh-i-Azal was accused of attempting to plot to kill Baháʼu'lláh. In contemporary accounts, Subh-i Azal is reported to have tried to have Baháʼu'lláh assassinated at the hands of the barber of the local bath. The barber, Muhammad ʻAlí of Isfahán, apparently refused and spread word of the danger around the community. Baháʼu'lláh is reported to have counselled \"on all patience, quietude and gentleness\". This pattern was repeated when, according to the personal account of Ustád Muhammad-ʻAlíy-i Salmání, Subh-i Azal attempted to persuade him likewise to murder Baháʼu'lláh in the bath. Eventually Subh-i-Azal attempted to poison Baháʼu'lláh that left him gravely ill for a time, and left him with a shaking hand for the rest of his life. Later, followers of Azal made the counter-claim that Baháʼu'lláh had accidentally poisoned himself while trying to poison others. Smith also notes that the Baháʼí accounts of this dispute seem to be credible.\n\nAfter this event in 1866 Baháʼu'lláh made his claim to be Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest public, as well as making a formal written announcement to Subh-i-Azal referring to his followers for the first time as the \"\"people of Bahá\"\". After his public announcement, Baháʼu'lláh secluded himself in his house and instructed the Bábís to choose between himself and Subh-i-Azal. Baháʼu'lláh's claims threatened Subh-i-Azal's position as leader of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the Bábís if \"Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest\" were to appear and start a new religion. Subhh-i-Azal responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the traditional Bábísm was largely unpopular, and his followers became the minority.\n\nIn 1867, Subh-i-Azal challenged Baháʼu'lláh to a test of the divine will in a local mosque in Edirne (Adrianople), such that \"God would strike down the impostor.\" Baháʼu'lláh agreed, and went to the Sultan Selim mosque at the appointed time, but Mirza Yahya lost face and lost credibility when he refused to show up.\n\nEventually Baháʼu'lláh was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as \"He whom God shall make manifest\" and his followers began calling themselves Baháʼís. The small minority of Bábís that followed Subh-i-Azal became known as Azalis.\n\nAfter the Bábí community was separated into two, the Azalis tried to discredit Baháʼu'lláh to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of causing agitation against the government. While an investigation cleared Baháʼu'lláh, it did notify the government that Baháʼu'lláh and Subh-i-Azal were propagating religious claims, and may cause future disorder, and thus led to the further exile of the 'Bábí' leaders. A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the Bábís to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire — Famagusta, Cyprus for Subh-i-Azal and his followers, and ʻAkká, in Ottoman Palestine, for Baháʼu'lláh and his followers.\n\nWhile most of those that followed Subh-i-Azal were sent to Cyprus, some were sent to Akká, intended to serve as spies. In 1872 a few Baháʼís decided to kill the followers of Subh-i-Azal as they were causing endless difficulties to the Baháʼí community. Baháʼu'lláh strongly condemned the action, and publicly condemned the murderers as clear violators of Baháʼí law. The Ottoman authorities initially hardened the imprisonment of Baháʼu'lláh. But as Baháʼu'lláh was later exonerated by the authorities as having no connection to the murders, their imprisonment was eased.\n\nEventually Baháʼu'lláh was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as \"He whom God shall make manifest\" and his followers began calling themselves Baháʼís. By 1908 there were probably from half a million to a million Baháʼís, and at most only a hundred followers of Subhh-i-Azal. Subh-i Azal died in Famagusta, Cyprus in 1912, and his followers are known as Azalis or Azali Bábis. MacEoin notes that after the deaths of those Azali Babis who were active in the Constitutional Revolution in Iran, the Azali form of Babism entered a stagnation which it has not recovered as there is no acknowledged leader or central organization. Current estimates of Azalis are that there are no more than a few thousand. The \"World Religion Database\" estimated 7.3 million Baháʼís in 2010 and stated: \"The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha'i(sic) was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region.\" Baháʼí sources since 1991 usually estimate the worldwide Baháʼí population at \"above 5 million\". See Baháʼí statistics.\n\nAfter Baháʼu'lláh's death, leadership of the religion then passed on to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, Baháʼu'lláh's son, who was appointed by Baháʼu'lláh, and was accepted by almost all Baháʼís. After the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Baháʼí community was passed on to his grandson, Shoghi Effendi, who was appointed in ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's will. The document appointed Shoghi Effendi as the first Guardian, and called for the election of the Universal House of Justice once the Baháʼí Faith had spread sufficiently for such elections to be meaningful. Shoghi Effendi died in 1957, and in 1963 the Universal House of Justice was elected. Since 1963 the Universal House of Justice has been elected every five years and remains the successor and leading institution of the religion.\n\nThere are conflicting reports as to whom Subh-i-Azal appointed as his successor. Browne reports that there was confusion over who was to be Subh-i-Azal's successor at his death. Subh-i-Azal's son, Rizwán ʻAli, reported that he had appointed the son of Aqa Mirza Muhammad Hadi Daulatabadi as his successor; while another, H.C. Lukach's, states that Mirza Yahya had said that whichever of his sons \"resembled him the most\" would be the successor. None appear to have stepped forward. MacEoin notes that Subh-i-Azal appointed his son, Yahya Dawlatabadi, as his successor, but he notes that there is little evidence that Yahya Dawlatabadi was involved in the affairs of the religion, and that instead he spent his time as that of secular reformer. Shoghi Effendi reports that Mirza Yahya appointed a distinguished Bábí, Aqa Mirza Muhammad Hadi of Daulatabad (Mirza Hadiy-i-Dawlat-Abadi) successor, but he later publicly recanted his faith in the Báb and in Mirza Yahya. Mirza Yahya's eldest son apparently became a Baháʼí himself.\n\nThe practice of \"Taqiyya\" (Dissimulation, or concealing one's beliefs) was widespread among Azalis. While the primary means of transmitting copies of documents was manually copying them which could introduce discrepancies between copies the practice of \"taqiyya\" led some to actually alter and falsify Bábí teachings and history. This compromised their campaign against Baháʼu'lláh. One historian has concluded:\n\nCompounding the problem of collecting reliable manuscripts, Azali \"taqiyya\" had the effect of rendering many early Bábí documents unreliable afterwards, as Azali Bábís would often alter and falsify Bábí teachings and history.\n\nThe Arabic Bayán is a book written by the Báb around 1848, and is the smaller sister book to the Persian Bayán. The work is incomplete, containing only eleven chapters of a supposedly total nineteen. In the tablet that is considered the Báb's will and testament, he gives permission to Subh-i-Azal to finish the remaining eight, with the permission of Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest. The Azalis believe that this means that the Báb authorized Subh-i-Azal to finish the text of the Arabic Bayán. However, Saiedi states that even if it is assumed that Subh-i-Azal was allowed to finish the remaining chapters of the book, it could only happen if He whom God shall make manifest had already appeared and had revealed the eight chapters for him. The Báb states that after his death no one else's writings will be binding until the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest, and the text of the Arabic Bayán was written in a style termed \"divine verses\", and the Báb states that in another one of his writings that after him only He whom God shall make manifest can reveal divine verses. Subh-i-Azal did write a book that was supposed to complete the Bayán, the Mutammim-i-Bayan, but instead of completing the Arabic Bayán, he tries to extend the Persian Bayán; it seems Subh-i-Azal, unlike his followers, did not understand the reference of the Báb to mean that he had to complete the Arabic Bayán.\n\nSaiedi also points to another translation and interpretation of the version in the Báb's letter: the Báb's use the word \"manahij (paths)\" in two ways; in one way it refers to the chapters of the Bayán, and in another way it refers to the entire Bayán and his laws. Saiedi states that the reference to manifesting the eight paths may refer to the distribution of the eight copies of the Bayán that the Báb had sent to Subh-i-Azal, to the eight individuals who are identified in the letter, when the Promised One appears.\n\nThe Báb prophesied that the messianic figure He whom God shall make manifest would emerge some time in the future. Many of the Báb's writings support the belief that He whom God shall make manifest's arrival would be imminent. The Baháʼí belief is that the Báb's writings allude to the year 9, while the Azali belief is that He whom God shall make manifest would come after 2000 years.\n\nIn Azali belief, the Promised One could not appear until the realization of the laws of the Bayán and the maturation of the Bayán in 2000 years. However, there are problems with this belief and inconsistencies in Azali belief. The Azalis believe that the Báb gave permission for Subh-i-Azal to complete the Arabic Bayán with the permission of He whom God shall make manifest, thus pointing to He whom God shall make manifest appearing in Subh-i-Azal's own lifetime. Also, the \"Nuqtatu'l-Kaf\", an Azali text, states that the laws of the Bayán may be abrogated a few years after the Báb's death, and that He whom God shall make manifest may appear within Subh-i-Azal's lifetime. The Azali view that the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest can only occur thousands of years in the future is also problematic, since in some of their texts they state that Subh-i-Azal is He whom God shall make manifest.\n\nThe Báb writes in many of his texts about the imminent appearance of the Promised One. In many of his writings he refers to the year nine and nineteen from the beginning of his claimed revelation (1844) as to the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest. He also uses the Abjad numerals of Arabic, a system of providing numerical values for letters and words, to identify the coming of He whom God shall make manifest, referring the manifest aspect of the Most Great Name of God as \"\"Vahid\"\" which has a numerical value of 19 and the hidden aspect of the same name as \"\"Bahá\"\" which has a numerical value of 9. Baháʼís point to the Báb's allusions to the years nine (1853) and nineteen (1863) in the Báb's writings as a prophecy of Baháʼu'lláh being He whom God shall make manifest. Baháʼu'lláh claimed that while being imprisoned in the Siyah-Chal in 1853 in Iran he underwent a series of mystical experiences including having a vision of the \"Maid of Heaven\" who told him of his divine mission, and the promise of divine assistance. In 1863 as he was leaving Baghdad in the Garden of Ridván, Baháʼu'lláh made his first public declaration to be Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest.\n\nBaháʼís argue that succession in the Bábí religion was superseded when the Baháʼí Faith's founder Baháʼu'lláh declared himself to be He whom God shall make manifest – they often describe Subh-i-Azal as an \"interim head.\"\n\nBaháʼís view Subh-i-Azal's leadership largely as a nominal head. According to Taherzadeh:\n\n\"Mirza Yahya [Subh-i-Azal] came into prominence not because he possessed any outstanding qualities, but rather through his close link with Baháʼu'lláh. In order to divert the attention of the enemies of the Faith from the person of Baháʼu'lláh, Who had emerged as a focal point among the early believers, the Báb wholeheartedly approved the suggestion of nominating the youthful and relatively unknown Mirza Yahya [Subh-i-Azal] as the chief of the Bábí community. This suggestion had come from Baháʼu'lláh, and only two others were aware of the plan, namely, Baháʼu'lláh's faithful brother Mírzá Músá (Áqáy-i-Kalím) and a certain Mulla Abdu'l-Karim-i-Qazvini, who had been entrusted by the Báb, shortly before His martyrdom, with the task of delivering His pen-case, seals and writings to Baháʼu'lláh; he was subsequently martyred in Tihran at the time of Baháʼu'lláh's imprisonment in the Siyah-Chal.\n\nThe advantages of this nomination were obvious and, as this system operated for some time, those who were endowed with insight and wisdom were able to see that Mirza Yahya was only a figurehead, and that it was the guiding hand of Baháʼu'lláh alone that was unobtrusively directing the affairs of the Bábí community after the martyrdom of the Báb.\"\n\nThis view is supported by the Báb's long-time secretary Mulla Abdu'l-Karim-i-Qazvini, believed to be the only other person who participated in the plan. John Walbridge writes:\n\n\"With him [Mulla Abdu'l-Karim-i-Qazvini] Baháʼu'lláh originated the plan to proclaim Mirza Yahya as the Báb's successor while keeping him in hiding — this in order to deflect attention from Baháʼu'lláh, who was well known to the authorities and the people.\"\n\nQazvini himself wrote in a letter in 1851 describing the urgency that the friends do nothing to call attention to Baháʼu'lláh during his period of messianic secrecy:\n\n\"But it is requested, according to his [Baháʼu'lláh] command, that the friends should desist from hinting around (shivih-ha) about him, as they had in the past, in such a way that they provoked troubles for the friends of God; and that they should avoid bringing sorrow upon that gentleman, who is of gentle disposition.\nLet them not provoke investigations or cause the encounter with God to become more distant, or become a veil of chains and manacles between the servants and the Lord of Lords any more than they already have been.\"\n\nNear the end of his life the Báb had his remaining writings, other \"accoutrement\", as well as a particular tablet addressed to Baháʼu'lláh, delivered to him.\n\n\"In Qum, shortly before the Báb's martyrdom, he received a coffer from the Báb containing the last of his writings and his pen-case, seals, rings, and the famous pentacle tablet containing 350 derivatives of the word Bahá. He left the same day for Tehran, explaining that the Báb's accompanying letter ordered him to deliver it to Baháʼu'lláh.\"\n\nBaháʼís believes there is symbolism in the Báb sending to Báhá'u'llah not only all of his remaining writings, but his seals and his pens, literally handing over the instruments of revelation, along with the pentacle tablet written in his own hand confirming Baháʼu'lláh's station. The Báb's Will & Testament, which was unambiguously directed to Subh-i-Azal, makes it clear that he would not be the One promised by the Báb:\n\n\"We order you to obey Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest. He will verily appear amongst this people with a sublime reign in the final resurrection. Verily we are all servants and kneel down before Him. He shall carry out whatever He wishes, with permission from His Lord. He shall not be questioned for his actions. However, all others are responsible for everything they do.\" [verses 27–29]\n\nRegarding Subh-i-Azal, common Baháʼí belief is summarised by Shoghi Effendi, who wrote that Subh-i-Azal was \"good-natured yet susceptible to the slightest influence\". This is a reference to Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani, who is accused of conspiring with Subh-i-Azal and leading him astray. He is sometimes described as the Baháʼí \"anti-Christ\".\n\nAzalis rejected the divine claims of Baháʼu'lláh, arguing that the world must first accept the laws of the Báb before \"He Whom God Shall Make Manifest\" can appear.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2035274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035274", "title": "Clark–Wilson model", "text": "Clark–Wilson model\n\nThe Clark–Wilson integrity model provides a foundation for specifying and analyzing an integrity policy for a computing system.\n\nThe model is primarily concerned with formalizing the notion of information integrity. Information integrity is maintained by preventing corruption of data items in a system due to either error or malicious intent. An integrity policy describes how the data items in the system should be kept valid from one state of the system to the next and specifies the capabilities of various principals in the system. The model uses security labels to grant access to objects via transformation procedures and a restricted interface model.\n\nThe model was described in a 1987 paper (\"A Comparison of Commercial and Military Computer Security Policies\") by David D. Clark and David R. Wilson. The paper develops the model as a way to formalize the notion of information integrity, especially as compared to the requirements for multilevel security (MLS) systems described in the Orange Book. Clark and Wilson argue that the existing integrity models such as Biba (read-up/write-down) were better suited to enforcing data integrity rather than information confidentiality. The Biba models are more clearly useful in, for example, banking classification systems to prevent the untrusted modification of information and the tainting of information at higher classification levels, respectively. In contrast, Clark–Wilson is more clearly applicable to business and industry processes in which the integrity of the information content is paramount at any level of classification (although the authors stress that all three models are obviously of use to both government and industry organizations).\n\nAccording to Stewart and Chapple's \"CISSP Study Guide Sixth Edition\", the Clark-Wilson model uses a multi-faceted approach in order to enforce data integrity. Instead of defining a formal state machine, the model defines each data item and allows modifications through only a small set of programs. The model uses a three-part relationship of subject/program/object (where program is interchangeable with transaction) known as a \"triple\" or an \"access control triple.\" Within this relationship, subjects do not have direct access to objects. Objects can only be accessed through programs. Look here to see how this differs from other access control models.\n\nThe model’s enforcement and certification rules define data items and processes that provide the basis for an integrity policy. The core of the model is based on the notion of a transaction.\n\n\nThe model contains a number of basic constructs that represent both data items and processes that operate on those data items. The key data type in the Clark–Wilson model is a Constrained Data Item (CDI). An Integrity Verification Procedure (IVP) ensures that all CDIs in the system are valid at a certain state. Transactions that enforce the integrity policy are represented by Transformation Procedures (TPs). A TP takes as input a CDI or Unconstrained Data Item (UDI) and produces a CDI. A TP must transition the system from one valid state to another valid state. UDIs represent system input (such as that provided by a user or adversary). A TP must guarantee (via certification) that it transforms all possible values of a UDI to a “safe” CDI.\n\nAt the heart of the model is the notion of a relationship between an authenticated principal (i.e., user) and a set of programs (i.e., TPs) that operate on a set of data items (e.g., UDIs and CDIs). The components of such a relation, taken together, are referred to as a \"Clark–Wilson triple.\" The model must also ensure that different entities are responsible for manipulating the relationships between principals, transactions, and data items. As a short example, a user capable of certifying or creating a relation should not be able to execute the programs specified in that relation.\n\nThe model consists of two sets of rules: Certification Rules (C) and Enforcement Rules (E). The nine rules ensure the external and internal integrity of the data items. To paraphrase these:\n\nSince we must make sure that these TPs are certified to operate on a particular CDI, we must have E1 and E2.\n\nThis requires keeping track of triples (user, TP, {CDIs}) called \"allowed relations\".\n\nWe need authentication to keep track of this. \n\nWhen information enters the system it need not be trusted or constrained (i.e. can be a UDI). We must deal with this appropriately.\n\nFinally, to prevent people from gaining access by changing qualifications of a TP:\n\nA variant of Clark-Wilson is the CW-lite model, which relaxes the original requirement of formal verification of TP semantics. The semantic verification is deferred to a separate model and general formal proof tools.\n\n\n\n"}

The remains of the camp are listed as a heritage site of national significance. The city of Brugg hosts a small Roman museum, displaying finds from the legion camp.\n\nExcavations along the western edge of the Roman camp have discovered a few funeral pyre graves dating to the late Bronze Age ( 1000-800 BC). The first settlement of Vindonissa was a 1st century BC Helvetii fortified village on the peninsula between the Aare and Reuss rivers. The settlement was protected by an approximately long wood and earth wall, with an up to deep trench which stretched across the narrow neck of the peninsula. The settlement came under Roman control either after the 58 BC conquest of the Helvetii by Julius Caesar or the 15 BC conquest of the Alps.\n\nA small guard post was established on the site around 15 BC. The Roman settlement and legion camp was probably established in 15 AD. In an expansion around 30, thermal baths were added.\nThe Legio XIII \"Gemina\" was stationed at Vindonissa until 44 or 45. With the arrival of the 21st legion (XXI \"Rapax\") the camp was rebuilt with stone fortifications. After the 21st legion had looted the countryside in 69, it was replaced by the 11th legion (XI \"Claudia\") which remained stationed until 101. After this date, Vindonissa was a civilian settlement, with a castle built in the 4th century.\n\nThe camp established around 15 AD covered an area of about and was surrounded by an long wooden and earthen wall with wooden gates and low watchtowers surrounded by a double ditch . By 72 AD this had been replaced by a thick wall with massive gates, watchtowers and a single ditch.\n\nThe first systematic excavation of the ruins began in 1896. This and later excavations discovered the ruins of several buildings and numerous artifacts. A long Roman underground canal still provides water to the fountain at Königsfelden Monastery. Vindonissa included the largest Roman amphitheater in modern Switzerland with seats for about 10,000. The foundations of the west and north walls and the remains of a Roman bath have been discovered.\n\n"}

He is revered as one of the leading names in contemporary Portuguese poetry.\n\nEugénio de Andrade was born in Póvoa de Atalaia, Concelho do Fundão, Beira Baixa, on 19 January 1923. After his parents' marriage broke apart, he moved to Lisbon in 1933 and attended the Lyceum Passos Manuel and the Escola Técnica Machado de Castro where he wrote his first poems three years later. In 1938, he sent some of those poems to António Botto who encouraged him to keep writing, so much that he had his first book \"Narciso\" published in 1939 under his real name which would be dropped sometime later.\n\nIn 1943, Eugénio de Andrade moved to Coimbra and then to Tavira the following year, cities where he did the military service finished back in Coimbra in 1944. The same year he strengthened his friendship with Afonso Duarte, Eduardo Lourenço, Joaquim Namorado, Carlos de Oliveira, and Miguel Torga, friends he made during his time in the army. Having worked as administrative inspector for the Ministry of Health from 1947, a position held for 35 years, he finally settled in Porto in 1950 where he lived for more than four decades until he moved to the building of the former Eugénio de Andrade Foundation in Foz do Douro.\n\nDuring the years that followed, the poet traveled extensively, having been invited to take part in various events where befriended many personalities of Portuguese and foreign culture such as Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen, José Luis Cano, Luis Cernuda, Mário Cesariny, Ángel Crespo, Herberto Helder, João Miguel Fernandes Jorge, Óscar Lopes, Agustina Bessa Luís, Joaquim Manuel Magalhães, Jaime Montestrela, Vitorino Nemésio, Teixeira de Pascoaes, Jorge de Sena, Joel Serrão, Ângelo de Sousa, Marguerite Yourcenar, and many others. Despite his national and international prestige he always lived apart from the so-called social, literary or bohemian life, having himself justified his rare public appearances due to \"this weakness of the heart called friendship\".\n\nEugénio de Andrade received numerous awards including the Prize of the Associação Portuguesa de Escritores (1986), Prize D. Dinis from Casa de Mateus Foundation (1988), the Great Poetry Prize of the Portuguese Association of Writers (1989) and the Camões Prize (2001). On 8 July 1982, he was made Grande Official da Ordem Militar de Sant'Iago da Espada, having been awarded also with the Grã-Cruz da Ordem do Mérito on 4 February 1989. He died in Porto on 13 June 2005 after prolonged neurological disease.\n\nEugénio de Andrade debuted with \"Narciso\" (1939), and became a better-known personality in the literary field with his book of verses \"Adolescente\" (1942). His well-deserved recognition came with the publication of \"As Mãos e os Frutos\" in 1948, which earned him critical acclaim from Jorge de Sena and Vitorino Nemésio. During the 1940s he took part in the World Literature Seminar (1946-1948). His essentially lyrical body of work was considered by José Saramago as one reached through continuous debugging.\n\nAmong dozens of published works are \"Os amantes Sem Dinheiro\" (1950), \"As Palavras Interditas\" (1951), \"Escrita da Terra\" (1974), \"Matéria Solar\" (1980), \"Rente ao Dizer\" (1992), \"Ofício da Paciência\" (1994), \"O Sal da Língua\" (1995), and \"Os Lugares do Lume\" (1998).

{"id": "2035296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035296", "title": "Battery pack", "text": "Battery pack\n\nA battery pack is a set of any number of (preferably) identical batteries or individual battery cells. They may be configured in a series, parallel or a mixture of both to deliver the desired voltage, capacity, or power density. The term battery pack is often used in reference to radio-controlled hobby toys and battery electric vehicles.\n\nComponents of battery packs include the individual batteries or cells, and the interconnects which provide electrical conductivity between them. Rechargeable battery packs often contain a temperature sensor, which the battery charger uses to detect the end of charging. Interconnects are also found in batteries as they are the part which connects each cell, though batteries are most often only arranged in series strings.\n\nWhen a pack contains groups of cells in parallel there are differing wiring configurations which take into consideration the electrical \"balance\" of the circuit. Battery regulators are sometimes used to keep the voltage of each individual cell below its maximum value during charging so as to allow the weaker batteries to become fully charged, bringing the whole pack back into balance. Active balancing can also be performed by battery balancer devices which can shuttle energy from strong cells to weaker ones in real time for better balance. A well-balanced pack lasts longer and delivers better performance.\n\nFor an inline package, cells are selected and stacked with solder in between them. The cells are pressed together and a current pulse generates heat to solder them together and to weld all connections internal to the cell. \n\nSOC, or state of charge, is the equivalent of a fuel gauge for a battery. SOC cannot be determined by a simple voltage measurement, because the terminal voltage of a battery may stay substantially constant until it is completely discharged. In some types of battery, electrolyte specific gravity may be related to state of charge but this is not measurable on typical battery pack cells, and is not related to state of charge on most battery types. Most SOC methods take into account voltage and current as well as temperature and other aspects of the discharge and charge process to in essence count up or down within a pre-defined capacity of a pack. More complex state of charge estimation systems take into account the Peukert effect which relates the capacity of the battery to the discharge rate.\n\nAn advantage of a battery pack is the ease with which it can be swapped into or out of a device. This allows multiple packs to deliver extended runtimes, freeing up the device for continued use while charging the removed pack separately.\n\nAnother advantage is the flexibility of their design and implementation, allowing the use of cheaper high-production cells or batteries to be combined into a pack for nearly any application.\n\nAt the end of product life, batteries can be removed and recycled separately, reducing the total volume of hazardous waste.\n\nPacks are often simpler for end users to repair or tamper with than a sealed non-serviceable battery or cell. Though some might consider this an advantage it is important to take safety precautions when servicing a battery pack as they pose a danger as potential chemical, electrical, and fire risks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2035308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035308", "title": "Animal science", "text": "Animal science\n\nAnimal science (also bioscience) is described as \"studying the biology of animals that are under the control of humankind\". It can also be described as the production and management of farm animals. Historically, the degree was called animal husbandry and the animals studied were livestock species, like cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, and horses. Today, courses available now look at a far broader area to include companion animals like dogs and cats, and many exotic species. Degrees in Animal Science are offered at a number of colleges and universities. Typically, the Animal Science curriculum not only provides a strong science background, but also hands-on experience working with animals on campus-based farms. \n\nProfessional education in animal science prepares students for career opportunities in areas such as animal breeding, food and fiber production, nutrition, animal agribusiness, animal behavior and welfare. Courses in a typical Animal Science program may include genetics, microbiology, animal behavior, nutrition, physiology, and reproduction. Courses in support areas, such as genetics, soils, agricultural economics and marketing, legal aspects, and the environment also are offered. All of these courses are essential to entering an animal science profession.\n\nAt many universities, a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Animal Science allows emphasis in certain areas. Typical areas are species-specific or career-specific. Species-specific areas of emphasis prepare students for a career in dairy management, beef management, swine management, sheep or small ruminant management, poultry production, or the horse industry. Other career-specific areas of study include pre-veterinary medicine studies, livestock business and marketing, animal welfare and behavior, animal nutrition science, animal reproduction science, or genetics. Youth programs are also an important part of animal science programs.\n\nMany schools that offer a degree option in Animal Science also offer a pre-veterinary emphasis such as Iowa State University, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the University of Minnesota, for example. This option provides an in-depth knowledge base of the biological and physical sciences including nutrition, reproduction, physiology, and genetics. This can prepare students for graduate studies in animal science, veterinary school, and pharmaceutical or animal science industries.\n\nIn a Master of Science degree option, students take required courses in areas that support their main interest. These courses are above courses normally required for a Bachelor of Science degree in the Animal Science major. For example, in a Ph.D. degree program students take courses related to their major that are more in-depth than those for the Master of Science degree, with an emphasis on research or teaching.\n\nGraduate studies in animal sciences are considered preparation for upper-level positions in production, management, education, research, or agriservices. Professional study in veterinary medicine, law, and business administration are among the most commonly chosen programs by graduates. Other areas of study include growth biology, physiology, nutrition, and production systems.\n\n\n"}

It also contains capacitors for the electrical stimulation of the neurons. The University of Calgary, Faculty of Medicine scientists led by Pakistani-born Canadian scientist Naweed Syed who proved it is possible to cultivate a network of brain cells that reconnect on a silicon chip—or the brain on a microchip—have developed new technology that monitors brain cell activity at a resolution never achieved before.\n\nDeveloped with the National Research Council Canada (NRC), the new silicon chips are also simpler to use, which will help future understanding of how brain cells work under normal conditions and permit drug discoveries for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n\nNaweed Syed's lab cultivated brain cells on a microchip.\nThe new technology from the lab of Naweed Syed, in collaboration with the NRC, was published online in August 2010, in the journal, Biomedical Devices. It is the world's first neurochip. It is based on Syed's earlier experiments on neurochip technology dating back to 2003.\n\n\"This technical breakthrough means we can track subtle changes in brain activity at the level of ion channels and synaptic potentials, which are also the most suitable target sites for drug development in neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychological disorders,\" says Syed, professor and head of the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, member of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute and advisor to the Vice President Research on Biomedical Engineering Initiative of the University of Chicago.\n\nThe new neurochips are also automated, meaning that anyone can learn to place individual brain cells on them. Previously it took years of training to learn how to record ion channel activity from brain cells, and it was only possible to monitor one or two cells simultaneously. Now, larger networks of cells can be placed on a chip and observed in minute detail, allowing the analysis of several brain cells networking and performing automatic, large-scale drug screening for various brain dysfunctions.\n\nThis new technology has the potential to help scientists in a variety of fields and on a variety of research projects. Gerald Zamponi, professor and head of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, and member of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute, says, “This technology can likely be scaled up such that it will become a novel tool for medium throughput drug screening, in addition to its usefulness for basic biomedical research”.\n\n\"In previous studies, researchers developed a neurochip that could directly stimulate and record brain cell activity. Now, Orly Yadid-Pecht and Naweed Syed have successfully developed a novel lab-on-a-chip technology that, through an ultra-sensitive component built directly on the microchip, also enables direct imaging of activity in brain cells.\"\n\nPresent applications are neuron research. Future applications (still in the experimental phase) are retinal implants or brain implants.\n\n\n"}

In many cases, it may give added or contrasting flavor. Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart. This is in contrast to a condiment, a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being garni, the French term for \"garnished.\"\n\nMany garnishes are not intended to be eaten, though for some it is fine to do so. Parsley is an example of a traditional garnish; this pungent green herb has small distinctly shaped leaves, firm stems, and is easy to trim into a garnish.\n\nA garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing. They may, for example, enhance their color, such as when paprika is sprinkled on a salmon salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when chives are sprinkled on potatoes. They may make a cocktail more visually appealing, such as when a cocktail umbrella is added to an exotic drink, or when a Mai Tai is topped with any number of tropical fruit pieces. Sushi may be garnished with \"baran\", a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an entrée could be topped with a sauce, as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\n\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish.

The party is not registered and is technically banned, however it continues to operate inside Iran.\n\nDuring the Pahlavi dynasty, the party was represented in the Parliament and considered a semi-opposition within the regime, allowed to operate until officially denouncing Iran's assent to Bahraini independence in 1971. The party was forced to close down and merge into the Resurgence Party in 1975.\n\nIt is an occasional supporter of the major nationalist party, National Front, and was nationalist and fascist with respect to its ideology. Pan-Iranist Party was an anti-communist organization and regularly battled Tudeh Party of Iran mobs in the streets of Tehran.\n\nPan-Iranist Party spoke supportive of the Iranian Green Movement in 2009 and its discourse was revived in the 2010s by the conservatives who tactically adopted its positions amidst Iran–Saudi disagreements and clash.\n\nThe invasion of Iran by Anglo-Soviet armies in the early 20th century led to a sense of insecurity among Iranians who saw the king, Reza Shah, powerless against such foreign presence in the country. There were soldiers from Russia, England, India, New Zealand, Australia and later on, America, present in the country, especially in the capital, Tehran.\n\nThe Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran influenced a series of student movements in 1941 where nationalism was gaining popularity more than ever between Iranians, one of these new groups was an underground nationalist guerrilla group called the Revenge group (also known as the Anjoman).\n\nThe Pan-Iranist Party was founded later on by two of the members of the revenge group and two other students in the mid-to-late 1940s in Tehran University. Though the pan-Iranist movement had been active throughout the 1930s, it had been a loosely organized grass roots alliance of nationalist writers, teachers, students, and activists. The party was the first organization to officially adopt the pan-Iranist position, which believed in the solidarity and reunification of the Iranian peoples inhabiting the Iranian plateau.\n\nIn 1951, Mohsen Pezeshkpour and Dariush Forouhar came to a disagreement as to how the party should operate, and a division occurred. The Pezeskpour faction, which retained the party name, believed in working within the system of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Forouhar faction, which adopted a new name, Mellat Iran (\"Nation of Iran Party\"), believed in working against the system. Mellat Iran was far more fervently nationalist than the former party, and strongly supported and was allied with the national movement of Mohammad Mossadegh, who had founded the National Front of Iran (\"Jebhe Melli\") with other Iranian nationalist leaders.\n\nThe party was allegedly funded by the Central Intelligence Agency through TPBEDAMN.\n\nAfter the British-American sponsored coup d'etat against Mossadegh, the Shah assumed dictatorial powers and outlawed almost all political groups, including Mellat Iran and the National Front. The Pan-Iranist Party soon became the official opposition in the Majlis, with Pezeshkpour as Speaker. However, in reality, the party had very little political power and influence and its position was primarily intended to be symbolic. Beginning in the late 1960s, under the government of Amir Abbas Hoveyda, Iran mostly became a one-party dictatorship under the Imperial Resurrection Party (\"Rastakhiz\").\n\nPezeshkpour remained active in the Majlis and spoke out against British rule in Bahrain, which Iran claimed. He established a residence in the city of Khorramshahr, which at the time was home to some of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Iran, and which also became his base of operations. In Khuzestan the party was for the first time able to become a dominant influence, whereas in the rest of Iran, the party continued to have very little effect.\n\nWith the onset of revolution in 1978, Pezeshkpour and other politicians who had been allied with the Shah fled the country into exile. Mohammad Reza Ameli Tehrani, a co-founder of the party, was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Court, and subsequently executed in May 1979. Nationalist movements such as Mellat Iran and the National Front, which had been opposed to the Shah, remained in the country and played a crucial role in the revolutionary provisional government of Mehdi Bazargan. After the Islamic Revolution of 1979 which eventually saw the rise to power of Khomeini to the position of Supreme Leader after the collapse of the provisional government, all nationalist groups, as well as socialist and communist movements such as the Tudeh Party, were banned.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Pezeshkpour wrote a letter of apology to the new Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, stating that he wished to return to Iran and promised to stay out of politics for good. Khamenei accepted the apology and allowed Pezeshkpour to return, on the condition that he not resume his previous political activities. However, sometime afterwards Pezeshkpour became active in politics once again and reestablished the Pan-Iranist Party in Iran. He reformed the party structure and abandoned much of the old organizational ideology which Forouhar had opposed and which had originally led to the division. However, the Pan-Iranist Party and Mellat Iran did not reconcile and continued to function as separate organizations.\n\nIn the wake of the student demonstrations of 1999, many members of the Pan-Iranist Party were arrested and nine members of the party leadership, including Pezeshkpour himself, were summoned to the Islamic Revolutionary Court. The charges made against them included distribution of anti-government propaganda in the official party newspaper, \"National Sovereignty\".\n\nIn the summer of 2004, an attempt by a motorist, allegedly an undercover operative of the Ministry of Intelligence, on the life of Mohsen Pezeshkpour failed in front of his residence in Tehran.\n\nOn August 27, 2009, Hossein Shahriari, Reza Kermani, and Hojat Kalashi, three veteran members of the Pan Iranist Party, were arrested in the residence of Reza Kermani and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for “propaganda against the regime, and being a member of the Pan Iranist Party” by the Revolutionary Court in Karaj.\n\nDuring January, 2011, co-founder of the Pan Iranist Party, Mohsen Pezeshkpour was announced dead when under house arrest by the Iranian Government. As a result, Reza Kermani was declared the new leader of the Pan Iranist Party.\n\nSometime in 2012, Reza Kermani died due to health issues brought upon him by the 18 months imprisonment within Rajaiee Shahr Prison, where conditions have been deemed inhumane by many and criticised internationally.\n\nThe differences between Forouhar and Pezeshkpour lay mostly in organizational structure and policy, though there were specific ideological differences as well. Forouhar strongly believed in democracy and cooperation with other Iranian parties, including leftist-oriented groups, whereas Pezeshkpour believed in a more authoritarian approach and opposed alliances with non-nationalist organizations. However, alliances with other nationalist groups were rare or non-existent as most were officially banned (such as Mellat Iran). Under Pezeshkpour, the Pan-Iranist Party also took on a decidedly paramilitary structure, with members being assigned military ranks and titles. All active members, both male and female, wore uniforms to party functions. Forouhar also strongly opposed this, though this paramilitary nature was largely symbolic, and party members did not actually carry weapons. Ordinary members were not required to wear uniforms. Beginning in the late 1960s, Pezeshkpour also had several personal bodyguards who were assigned to protect him at all times.\n\nThe symbol of the party was a crossed out equal sign (=), signifying \"inequality\". This was in reference to foreign powers such as Britain and the Soviet Union, and symbolized the Pan-Iranist view that Iran must uphold its national sovereignty and interests above all else. The philosophical meaning attributed to this symbol according to the party's literature was that, in reality, there is no equality amongst nations, and that each nation must struggle to rise above all others, otherwise risking oblivion. This symbolism and philosophy also played a crucial role in the division between Forouhar and Pezeshkpour.\n\nPezeshkpour was often criticized by other nationalists for having not supported Mossadegh, and for his role in the Shah's government as Speaker of Majlis, as this position had no real power. Nationalist leaders viewed the failure of his opposition to the separation of Bahrain as evidence that his function was strictly symbolic.\n\nWhen Pezeshkpour set about restoring the party after returning to Iran, he and other former party leaders renounced the former paramilitary structure of the organization as well as its authoritarianism, instead proclaiming their commitment to plurality and democracy, as well as a willingness to cooperate with other opposition groups. They continue to maintain the original party symbolism.\n\n\n"}

From its launch until 2008, the network primarily focused upon home improvement, cooking, and leisure-themed programs. In 2008, the network re-launched as Planet Green, which carried a focus on environmentalism and sustainable living; Discovery spent $50 million on developing programming for the network. Planet Green was ultimately considered a failure; by 2010, the network had begun adding programming unrelated to ecology and eventually populated its schedule with reruns of library programming ahead of a future rebranding. \n\nIn May 2012, the channel re-launched as Destination America, which originally featured programming focused on American culture—including food, lifestyles, and travel—in a similar manner to the then-competing Travel Channel. From 2016–2018, the channel shifted to programming related to paranormal topics and investigations; it would reverse course after Discovery re-acquired Travel Channel (which would then shift to paranormal-themed series itself) during its purchase of Scripps Networks Interactive.\n\nAs of February 2015, approximately 57,238,000 American households (49.2% of households with television) receive Destination America.\n\nThe space was originally used for one of the four digital cable networks launched by Discovery Communications in 1996. The new networks were first announced in November 1994, with a launch planned for Spring 1995. At the time, the network had the working title Living and was described as \"a home repair network\". The launch was delayed, and the channel made its debut in October 1996, originally known as Discovery Travel & Living and offering programming including do-it-yourself projects, cooking, interior design and landscaping, and party planning.\n\nBy 1998, it had settled on the name Discovery Home & Leisure, but the \"Leisure\" part of the name was dropped on March 29, 2004, when the channel became Discovery Home. Much of the travel-related programming was dropped in the process to provide more focus on home improvement and cooking.\n\nIn April 2007, during its upfronts, Discovery announced that Discovery Home would re-launch in 2008 as a new channel focused on environmentalism and sustainable living. The channel itself was announced as part of a $50 million corporate initiative known as \"Planet Green\", undertaken under Discovery's new CEO David Zaslav, which would include the production of programming on other Discovery channels (such as the Discovery Channel series \"Ten Ways to Save the Planet\") that appeal to these themes, an \"innovation conference\", and making its headquarters carbon neutral. Zaslav stated that Discovery Home had been economically sound, but wasn't \"serving this higher purpose\". On August 1, 2007, Discovery announced its acquisition of \"TreeHugger\", a blog focusing on sustainable living. The site was to be positioned as a digital companion to the new channel.\n\nIn October 2007, Discovery hired veteran producer Andy Friendly as a consultant for Planet Green's programming, and to executive produce a series for the channel. The new series, \"Supper Club\", was announced in January 2008, and would be hosted by Tom Bergeron (whom Friendly had helped cast as host for \"Hollywood Squares\"). Further programming details were announced in Discovery's April 2008 upfronts, including specials hosted by NBC News correspondent Tom Brokaw, \"Battleground Earth\", \"Emeril Green\", \"Hollywood Green with Maria Menounos\", and the Bill Nye-hosted \"Stuff Happens\", among other series. It was announced that the network would launch on June 4, 2008, but that a \"sneak peek\" of the network's programming would become available via video on demand on April 17. Later that month, Planet Green ordered a weekly news series from ABC News (\"Focus Earth\"), hosted by Bob Woodruff, that would focus on environmental issues. \n\nPlanet Green was one of the two highly-anticipated Discovery network re-launches spearheaded by Zaslav, the other being the Oprah Winfrey Network (a relaunch of Discovery Health that was ultimately delayed to January 2011).\n\nIn March 2010, Planet Green's programming was broadened to include non-ecology themed shows; despite this broadened focus, in February 2011, Discovery Communications executives were acknowledging the channel's failure. Zaslav stated in a conference call with investors that Discovery \"can probably do something else with that that would be more meaningful.\" Shortly thereafter the channel had abandoned its theme, rerunning programs from other Discovery Communications channels and featuring programming blocks such as \"Paranormal Fridays\". Discovery announced a probable rebranding of the channel by the start of the summer of 2012.\n\nOn April 4, 2012, Discovery announced through the early release of an article in \"USA Today\" that Planet Green would be re-branded as Destination America, a network focusing primarily on cuisine, natural history, and travel programming, appealing primarily towards Middle America. The launch lineup also featured programs that had previously aired on Travel Channel before its sale to Cox Communications. The channel was originally expected to have a Memorial Day launch on May 28, 2012. \n\nIn 2015, TNA partnered with Discovery Communications to air the promotion's programming on Destination America, including \"Impact Wrestling\". Later that year, the network also announced that it had signed a 26-week television deal for Ring of Honor's weekly show, \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\", which would begin on June 3, 2015. \"Impact\" moved to Pop in January 2016.\n\nThe network also began to increase its focus on programs dealing with paranormal topics and investigations; on October 30, 2015, it aired \"Exorcism Live\"—a live special broadcast from the St. Louis site of the exorcism of Roland Doe, featuring the cast of \"Ghost Asylum\" and Chip Coffey. The March 4, 2016 premiere of \"Paranormal Lockdown\" was among the highest-rated series premieres in the channel's history, which prompted further growth in the channel's focus on paranormal series. Destination America underwent a rebranding in 2017, with on-air presentation carrying a darker and \"uneasy\" atmosphere (including a signature \"glitch\" effect) to reflect its change in programming direction.\n\nDiscovery's 2018 acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive brought Travel Channel back under its ownership; a rebranding of Travel Channel in October 2018 repositioned the network to focus more on paranormal programming. Since then, Destination America's schedule has largely shifted back towards its original format, while also adding reruns of Travel Channel programs that had been displaced by its own shifts in format.\n\nPlanet Green programming included ecologically themed shows built around celebrities including Ed Begley Jr., Emeril Lagasse, Adrian Grenier, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ludacris, Tommy Lee, Tom Bergeron, SuChin Pak, Maria Menounos, Bob Woodruff, and Discovery Channel producer Tom Golden. In addition, celebrities gave 'green' tips within network bumpers that transitioned into and out of commercial breaks. The channel was programmed in eight-hour blocks, which repeated three times per day until April 2010. Lacking separate satellite feeds for the East and West coasts of the United States, prime-time programs ran from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time and were then repeated.\n\nShows previously seen on Planet Green include:\n\n"}

In 2004, the STN was the fourth tribe in Connecticut to gain federal recognition. But in 2005, after strong opposition from the state and several local governments as well as one landowner, several Schaghticoke individuals and the SIT, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) reversed its decision, revoking recognition.\n\nThe Schaghticoke filed a land claims action, seeking restoration of a total of . Most of the land in question is undeveloped. It is owned by the Kent School, Connecticut Light & Power, a few private landowners, and the federal government. Following the Bureau of Indian Affairs' re-determined negative decision and resultant reversal of the STN's federal acknowledgment, the US District Court dismissed the land claim case in 2010. \"In ruling on the cross-motions for summary judgment, the court concluded that the BIA's final determination was 'reasonable based on the evidence before it,' and that the STN failed to satisfy the criteria of 'community' and 'political influence or authority' due to the fact that a substantial portion of the Schaghticoke refused to be enrolled as members of the STN.\" The tribe appealed the court's decision to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in late February 2010, where the lower court's decision was affirmed. STN took its case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which in October 2010 denied to review the appellate decision.\n\nSchaghticoke has various spellings: Pachgatgoch, Patchgatgoch, Pisgachtigok, Pishgachtigok, Scachtacook, Scaghkooke, Scanticook, Scatacook, Scaticook, Schaacticook, Scotticook, Seachcook, derived from an Algonquian Dialect-R word \"Pishgachtigok,\" meaning \"the confluence of two waterways or \"Gathered Waters.\" This may refer to the confluence of the Ten Mile River and the Housatonic River, where Mauwehu, the son of Chief Squantz, removed most of the Schaghticoke people. The language/culture base is Algonquian with Iroquoian influence.\n\nIn 1724, colonial settlers from Fairfield, Connecticut received approval from the General Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut to establish a new township. According to one account, they negotiated with Chief Squantz. Alternatively, it is told that they did not negotiate with Chief Squantz because he moved to the north end of Squantz Pond land area and refused to \"sell\" the township of New Fairfield. They returned in the Spring of 1725, but found that Chief Squantz had died during the Winter. His four sons and heirs refused to sign the deeds. It was not until four years later that the white men called \"The Proprietors\" finally got the drawn marks of several other native people who may not have had authority to sell the land. They \"purchased\" a 31,000 acre tract of land that is now called New Fairfield and Sherman, for the equivalent of about 300 dollars and on April 24, 1729, The deed was recorded on May 9, 1729, and is now deposited in the archives of the State Capitol in Hartford.\n\nGranted a reserve in 1736 by the General Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut, the Schaghticoke tribe have one of the oldest reservations in the United States. But, today their original , once located on both sides of the Housatonic River, has been diminished to a 400-acre (1.6 km²) reservation on the west side of the river. It includes a wilderness habitat for rattlesnakes, ruffed grouse, and other animals. At one time, the Schaghticoke tribe owned land from the Massachusetts border to the Ten Mile River.\n\nEuropean-American agents, appointed by the state, sold off more than 2,000 acres of tribal land between 1801 and 1911 without approval by the federal government. Tribal leaders say that the land sales and takings violated the Indian Non-Intercourse Act. This is the collective name of six statutes passed from 1790 to 1834, which said that only the federal government had the right to deal directly with Indian nations and had to approve all land sales for them.\n\nThe Schaghticoke Tribal Nation (STN) has filed suits for restoration of about 2100 acres. Much of the land in question is in Kent, on the eastern side of the Housatonic River from the current reservation. About half the campus of the private Kent School is on the disputed land. Another major portion is owned by the Preston Mountain Club, a private fishing club.\n\nThe Schaghticoke filed land rights suits in 1985, 1998 and 2000, the last two under the name and leadership of the STN. By 2010, the cases were consolidated; the defendants were the federal government, the Connecticut Light & Power Company, and the Kent School. In 1993, the federal government had proposed a land swap to Connecticut, offering 25 acres of federal land in exchange for 49.7 acres of the reservation, as part of a major restoration of the Appalachian Trail and securing control of it. The STN objected to the state's making the exchange for a lesser amount of land, threatening to close access to the Trail through the reservation.\n\nIn October 2010 a federal court granted the defendants' request to dismiss the case, based on the argument of \"collateral estoppel.\" The judge held that, as the BIA had determined in 2005 that STN did not meet the criteria for federal recognition as a tribe, it could not establish a \"prima facie\" case for land rights. As it was not a tribe, the state could not have violated the Non-Intercourse Act with the land deals. Because another federal court had upheld the BIA’s reversal of the STN’s federal acknowledgment (see below), the defendants had argued that the STN could not proceed with its land case.\n\nBut, the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation has appealed in federal court, arguing that a tribe does not have to be federally acknowledged in order to bring land claim lawsuits under the 1790 Non-Intercourse Act. At the end of November 2012, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals set February 25, 2013 as the deadline for the parties to submit their briefs in the land claims case.\n\nThe Schaghticoke land reserve is located along the Housatonic River, which is polluted with PCBs manufactured by Monsanto and put into the river by General Electric from their electrical transformer factory in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. This limits the use of the river and presents health risks to those who live along river, and for instance they may no longer eat the fish from the river.\n\nIn 1981 the Schaghticoke Indian Tribe (SIT) filed a petition for federal recognition. The tribal genealogist had documented that four family lineages form the basis of most of today's tribal members. These are the Cogswells, Kilsons, Harrises and Bradleys. During the nascent stages of the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation's petition process, several individual leaders, both elected and from within the community, disputed the STN leadership. The result was a political dispute that has not been resolved.\n\nRichard Velky is the chief of the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation who has been told by the BIA that they can not reform, regroup or reorganize and that the Schaghticoke Indian Tribe is the Historic continuation of the tribe; Alan Russell is the Tribal Chief of the S.I.T. and has been its leader since 1983. Neither represents all of the Schaghticoke people, including many who refuse to enroll with either political faction.\n\nIn December 2002, the BIA made a preliminary finding that the STN failed to satisfy two of seven criteria for recognition: proof of cohesive community and maintenance of a continuous political leadership. After the tribe provided more documentation in consultation with the agency, in January 2004 the Department of Interior acknowledged the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation as an Indian tribe according to the federal law and practice. STN was the fourth Connecticut tribes to gain federal recognition after the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, the Mohegan Tribe and the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation.\n\nThe Connecticut governor and other parties immediately opposed the Bureau of Indian Affairs decision, claiming adverse effects in communities due to the effects of gambling casinos. They feared the tribe would use recognition to press its land claims and to develop a casino. The Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation had received federal recognition in 2002, which the state was also opposing. The Mohegan Indian Tribe and Mashantucket Pequot had already developed increasingly successful, large casino resorts. In 2005, Representative Nancy Johnson introduced the \"Schaghticoke Acknowledgement Repeal Act of 2005\". Five requests were made to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA) to review the BIA Final Determination to Acknowledge the STN, which had been approved on January 24, 2004. The five requesters were (1) the “Coggswell Group,” a group of individuals described as “descendants of the historical tribe known today as the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation;” (2) the Town of Cornwall, Connecticut; (3) the State of Connecticut together with the Towns of Kent, Bethel, New Fairfield, Newtown, Ridgefield, Greenwich, Sherman, Westport, Wilton, and Weston as well as the Cities of Danbury and Stamford; the Kent School Corporation; the Connecticut Light and Power Company; and the Housatonic Valley Council of Elected Officials, (4) the Preston Mountain Club, Inc., a landowner; and (5) the Schaghticoke Indian Tribe, a group which has separately petitioned for Federal acknowledgment.\n\nOn May 12, 2005, the IBIA vacated the STN final determination and remanded it to the BIA for reconsideration. On October 11, 2005, the Office of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA) issued a Reconsidered Final Determination Denying Federal Acknowledgment of the STN. That same year, the IBIA also remanded the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation's (EPTN) positive final determination of federal acknowledgment to the OFA. The result was the same, the Schaghticoke experience - OFA issued a determination denying the federal acknowledgment of EPTN.\n\nThe Schaghticoke Tribal Nation was the first tribe to have had its federal acknowledgment rescinded.\n\nSTN appealed the BIA ruling, but in August 2009, federal Judge Peter Dorsey upheld it. The STN sued for relief in Federal court, but the suit was dismissed in August 2008. This ruling was appealed in the 2nd Circuit Court in New York and was denied on October 19, 2009. The STN had hoped to build a third gaming facility in Connecticut if they were federally acknowledged.\n\nIn 2015, the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued new rules saying that tribes which have previously been denied federal recognition cannot re-petition.\n\nOn January 29, 2009, STN members and supporters rallied at the Connecticut state capital. They presented a petition to Governor Jodi Rell, calling for an end to land encroachment on the reservation, and destruction of sites there. They wanted to raise awareness of the tribe's continued push to achieve federal recognition.\n\nChief Richard L. Velky, tribal chair of STN since 1987, has said, \"I can tell you this. They will never finish us off, and they will never take our land.\"\n\nIn 2011, the two tribal groups briefly united in trying to get Michael Rost, a non-Schaghticoke, expelled from reservation land. Members of both STN and SIT have said that Rost, claiming to have the right to be there as a guest of a tribal member, took and sold lumber illegally, built roads without a permit, and destroyed sensitive archeological sites. They took him to court to get him evicted.\n\nA Connecticut Superior Court evicted Rost that year. State Judge Corinne L. Klatt ruled that the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation and its leader Richard Velky were the legitimate representatives of the people: \"Based on the evidence submitted by both parties, the court finds that the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation, through its Tribal Council, is the governing authority for the Schaghticoke Tribe.This ruling was reversed by Judge Klatt and the S.I.T. and Alan Russell were recognized as the authority on the reservation in Kent.Ct\" Rost appealed the eviction order and on September 18, 2012 the appellate decision upheld Judge Klatt's eviction while correcting her determination that STN held tribal authority. Specifically, the appellate court held that, \"The court nevertheless agreed to open its earlier decision for the limited purpose of vacating its finding that STN, through its tribal council, was the governing authority for the Schaghticoke Indians. The court clarified as follows: ‘‘It’s the Schaghticoke Indians that have the right to say who lives on the reservation. And they clearly have spoken here. Because both plaintiffs are in agreement that they do not want [the defendant] on the location.’’ The court later stated: ‘‘I am reopening my decision and clarifying my decision, that even if [Richard] Velky, in my analysis of the law, even if Velky is not the accepted and recognized tribal leader, nevertheless the plaintiffs—the plaintiffs being the Schaghticoke Indian—that—Indians, not the Schaghticoke Indian Tribe, not the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation, but the Indians that were originally recognized by this state, are the individuals that have brought this summary process action and have moved to evict [the defendant]. So, that’s the clarification of the court’s decision. Accordingly, the court modified that portion of its earlier decision finding that STN was the governing authority for the Schaghticoke Indians.\" http://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/Cases/AROap/AP138/138AP532.pdf\n\nThe Schaghticoke Tribal Nation has an elected tribal council representing STN citizens and a chief-for-life, Richard L. Velky, who was elected in 1987. The Schaghticoke Indian Tribe also has a tribal council and a chief, Alan Russell. STN and SIT have separate tribal constitutions. There is a cross section of Bradleys, Coggswells, Harrises and Kilsons in each of these three groups (STN, SIT and the unaffiliated) There also is a small group of people of doubtful heritage who claim to be Schaghticoke and claim to govern themselves with the SIT constitution. The Schaghticoke Indian tribe located in Kent, Connecticut has 110 members.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Both holidays occur on dates in the lunar Islamic calendar, which is different from the solar based Gregorian calendar, so they are observed on different Gregorian dates every year. There are a number of other days of note and festivals, some common to all Muslims, other specific to Shia Islam as a whole or branches thereof.\n\nEid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan (a month of fasting during daylight hours), and Muslims may perform acts of zakat (charity) on the occasion, which begins after the new moon is sighted for the beginning of the month of Shawal. Celebration begins with prayers on the morning of 1 Shawal, followed by breakfast, and often celebratory meals throughout the day.\n\nEid al-Adha is celebrated on the tenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah, when the Hajj pilgrimage takes place, and lasts for four days. Muslims may perform an act of zakat and friendship by slaughtering a sheep and distributing the meat to family, to friends, and to the poor. Muslims are also encouraged to be especially friendly and reach out to one another during this period.\n\nMuslims celebrate when the Quran was revealed to Muhammad by fasting from dawn to sunset during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Fasting is a purifying experience so that Muslims can gain compassion and deepen their faith in Allah.\n\nThe act of fasting represents the condition experienced by the needy, who although already hungry must also fast for Ramadan. Muslims fast by denying themselves food, water and all related sexual activity with their spouses, but people with chronic diseases or unhealthy conditions such as diabetes, and children are exempt from fasting. Travelers, and women who are menstruating or nursing a baby, are exempt from fasting but are required to fast later. A person's observance of fasting can be for naught if religiously forbidden acts are made, such as Ghibah (backbiting others) and deceiving others.\n\nThe Islamic calendar is based on the synodic period of the Moon's revolution around the Earth, approximately 29 days. The Islamic calendar alternates months of 29 and 30 days (which begin with the new moon). Twelve of these months make up an Islamic year, which is 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year.\n\nSome Gregorian dates may vary slightly from those given, and may also vary by country.

{"id": "2035421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035421", "title": "One-Design", "text": "One-Design\n\nOne-Design is a racing method which may be adopted in sports which use complex equipment, whereby all vehicles have identical or very similar designs or models. In motor racing, it is also known as one-make racing and spec racing.\n\nAs manufacturing technologies became more efficient and effective over the course of the 20th century, racers in a number of sports realized that there was an important need to equalize the design of the equipment that they were competing in. One-Design racing is the ultimate result of this. Most often, the members of a One-Design class are near identical as a direct consequence of all deriving from the same production line. Sometimes they are checked or measured at stages in their use to guarantee continuing conformity to the standard design. The important factors being measured in One-Design racing help to equalize the vehicles and put more emphasis on the skill of the competitors.\n\nOne-Design is utilized in a variety of racing sports.\n\nIt is heavily used in sailboat racing. All competitors in a One-Design race are judged simply on a 'first to the finish' basis using a single start time. Other approaches to racing involve either a handicapping process (adjusting each competitor's elapsed time over the course by a factor based on the handicap figure for their boat), or restricting participants to using boats of some recognised class or type, or allowing only boats which conform to some formula or other specification. In the United States, the One-Design Class Council creates, monitors, and enforces the rules that define what classes of sailboats are One-Design boats.\n\nIt can additionally refer to airplanes or motor vehicles, such as IndyCars, where teams are required to meet certain specifications such as vehicle weight, engine displacement, weight, fuel capacity, and a variety of other factors are measured and regulated, or classes limited to a single make, such as the Yamaha RD Cup.\n\nIn motorsport, this term is commonly known as one-make racing and this term is predominantly given to series for production based cars such as the Porsche Supercup.\n\nThere are two primary methods of competition in sailboat racing: One-Design and handicap (see: Portsmouth Yardstick, PHRF and LYS (Leading Yard Stick)). One-design refers to a racing class that consists of just one model or design of sailboat. In one-design racing, the first boat to finish wins the race. This is contrasted with handicap racing, where time is added or subtracted from the finishing times based on design factors and mathematical formulas to determine the winner.\n\nIn between One-Design and handicap racing, a number of other approaches exist. One-Design can be contrasted with a development class, the classic example being the America's Cup 12-metre class, or to the Box Rule used, for example, in the TP 52 class.\n\nA further category, the formula based class setup, is sometimes confused with one-design. The Mini Transat 6.50, the Volvo Open 70 monohull, the large ORMA trimaran, and the Formula 18 racing beach catamaran are the exponents of the formula approach. Class-legal boats race each other without any handicap calculations in both setups. However, under one-design the boats are virtually identical except in details, while the Formula setup allows the boats to differ much more in design while keeping a few important specifications the same. As a result, the identifier \"One-Design\" has been used more and more exclusively to denote a class that races only identical boats.\n\nHaving a rigid one-design specification keeps design experimentation to a minimum and reduces cost of ownership. The popularity of one-design increased in the 1970s with the introduction of laminate construction using fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) and mold building technology. This process allowed the mass production of identical hulls of virtually any size at a lower price.\n\nThe one-design design idea was created by Thomas Middleton of the Shankill Corinthian Club located south of Dublin, Ireland in 1887. He proposed a class of double ended open dinghies of simple clincher construction in pine with a lifting boiler plate capable of being lifted. The boat was called The Water Wag. The idea was quickly adopted by sailors in Ireland, England, India and South America. The Water Wag Club still thrives in Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin.\nThe Solent One Design Class was one of the earliest O.D. classes formed after discussions took place in 1893 and subsequent years. It quickly became popular, and was patronised by some of the most energetic and best known yacht owners in the Solent, Portsmouth and Southampton waters including Sir Philip Hunloke, the King's yachtmaster. Formed under the auspices of the Solent Sailing Club, the class was adopted by the Royal Yacht Squadron and the Island Sailing Club in 1895. The dimensions of the boats were length overall, 33 ft 3 in; Waterline length, 25 ft; Beam, 7 ft 9 in; Draft, 5 ft; Sail area, 750 sq ft.; Displacement, 5 tons with 2 tons 13 cwt. of lead in the keel. Cutter rig with 6 ft bowsprit. Designed by H.W. White, ten were built in 1895/6 by Messrs. White Brothers of Itchen Ferry, Southampton and another twelve were built in the following year. The class enjoyed ten years of keen racing but the Metre Rule, which was introduced in 1907 effectively killed the class. The only boat still afloat is Rosenn, formally Eilun, sail number 6. Now, fully restored, she has been identified as meriting inclusion in the National Register of Historic Vessels of the United Kingdom. She is kept in Lymington where she is still racing and winning on the Solent.\n\nAs a general rule, the tolerances are strictest in smaller boats like dinghy classes and small keelboats. In some cases the tolerances are specified in a confidential Building Specification and often everything is designed and produced at the same factory or a very few factories. Examples are the Laser, Melges 24, and several small keelboats designed by Nathanael Greene Herreshoff, such as the 12½. In others the specification is published but the boats may only be produced by licensed manufacturers with usually only one builder in any country or region. Examples are the Olympic Finn and 470 but in both these classes a single manufacturer has succeeded in building faster boats than all other manufacturers. In yet others, for example the Optimist anyone may manufacture but tight controls of measurement result in strict one-design.\n\nIn medium- to large-sized boat classes, One-Design would refer to conformance to a standard specification, with the possibility of alterations being allowed as long as they remained within certain tolerances. Examples of this are the Dragon, J/24, Santana 20, Tartan 10, Etchells, J105, Schock 35, C&C Mega 30 One Design and the Farr 40. After the hull length overall (LOA) exceeds , people generally refer to the boat as an offshore one-design boat or yacht.\n\nIn other classes, the one-design class may have organized around an existing fleet of similar boats that traditionally existed together often for commercial purposes such as sailing canoes, dhows, and skipjacks, or boats that developed a common hull form over the years (such as A-Scows).\n\nIn contrast to 'one-design', other sailboats race under a variety of handicapping rules and formulas developed to allow different type boats to compete against one another. Formula rules include the Square Metre Rule, the Ton class, the Universal Rule, and the Metre Rule. Handicap rules include Portsmouth Yardstick, PHRF, IOR, IMS, IRC, Americap and LYS.\n\nOne-make racing series (also known as spec racing series) are racing series in which all competitors race with identical or very similar vehicles from the same manufacturer and suppliers. Typically, this means the same type of chassis, tyres, brakes, fuel, and powertrain are used by all drivers. One-make racing series may allow some non-spec parts, for example, Formula E allows teams to develop their own powertrains, and IndyCar teams have a choice of engine manufacturer. Conversely, series such as Formula One are not considered one-make racing series however may mandate some spec parts, such as tyres and sensors.\n\nThe idea behind one-make racing is that success will be based more on driver skill and car setup, instead of engineering skill and budget. One-make series are popular at an amateur level as they are affordable, due to the use of a common engine and chassis.\n\nExamples of one-make racing series from around the world include the Porsche Carrera Cup and Supercup, Radical European Masters, Power Maxed (formerly John Cooper Works) Mini Challenge and Commodore Cup. There are also various formula categories that utilize one-make racing, such as Formula 2, Super Formula, Formula Renault, Formula Mazda and the Formula Car Challenge.\n\nThere have been several attempts to bring the advantages of one-design to the sport of competitive glider racing. The most successful of these has been the Schweizer 1–26 class with 700 aircraft completed and flown between 1954–1981.\n\nSchweizer Aircraft principal Paul A Schweizer was a proponent of the One-Design concept. He intended the company's 1–26 to be the aircraft to establish a one-design class in the United States. He wrote:\n\n\"The true measure of pilot ability and experience is usually shown by his final standing in a contest. What could be more indicative of this when pilots are flying identical sailplanes with identical performance. One-design competition is the sure test of soaring skill.\"\n\nOther one-design gliders have included those made in Russia by Aviastroitel, in Poland by Warsztaty Szybowcowe Orlik, and Germany, where for example the DFS Olympia Meise was planned for the 1940 Olympic championships.\n\n"}

{"id": "2035447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035447", "title": "Ten Days of Repentance", "text": "Ten Days of Repentance\n\nThe Ten Days of Repentance (, Aseret Yemei Teshuva) are the first ten days of the Hebrew month of Tishrei, usually sometime in the month of September, beginning with the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah and ending with the conclusion of Yom Kippur.\n\nDuring this time it is considered appropriate for Jews to practice \"Teshuvah\" (literally: \"returning\" or \"repentance\") which is examining one's ways, engaging in repentance and the improvement of their ways in anticipation of Yom Kippur. A \"penitent\" is referred to as a baal teshuva (\"master [of] repentance\"). This repentance can be expressed in early morning prayers, known as \"selichot\", which capture the penitential spirit appropriate to the occasion and charity, acts of \"Hesed\" (\"loving-kindness\"), or self-reflection.\n\nThe first two days of a Ten Days of Repentance are on Rosh Hashanah. One of those days may occur on a Shabbat as well, making that day of Rosh Hashanah on which Shabbat occurs stricter in observance, meaning the observances of Shabbat are followed than a Rosh Hashanah that occurs on any other day but Shabbat (Saturday). When Rosh Hashanah occurs on a Shabbat a few additional prayers in the mahzor (\"prayer book\") are added as well as excluded in keeping with the combined theme of a Rosh Hashanah and Shabbat combination.\n\nThe third day is always Fast of Gedalia, it follows Rosh HaShanah. It is a half day fast, meaning it is only observed from dawn of the third day until dusk of that same day. However, when the third of Tishrei falls on Shabbat, the fast is postponed to the fourth day.\n\nAfter Rosh Hashanah ends and before Yom Kippur starts the next notable day is the special Shabbat that has its own name Shabbat Shuvah (\"Sabbath [of] Return\") meaning the Sabbath devoted to \"teshuva\" which means \"repentance\" in Judaism. \n\nThe tenth day is the last and it is always the serious Biblically mandated fast of Yom Kippur. decrees that Yom Kippur is a strict day of rest and of fasting. Yom Kippur can also fall out (meaning be observed) on a Shabbat, one of the rare times when fasting is allowed on that day. Even when it is on a regular weekday, Yom Kippur is still observed as a \"Shabbat\" because in the Torah it is referred to as a שבת שבתון \"Sabbath [of] Sabbaths\" .\n\nThree of the main observances are themes that are repeated in both the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur prayer services and printed in every mahzor (\"holiday prayer book\") of those two holy days: \"Repentance, Prayer and Charity (\"teshuva, tefila, tzedaka\") remove the evil decree\":\n\nThere are many observances, customs, rituals and prayers said and performed on Rosh Hashanah, such as: \n\nFasting is done partially only on Fast of Gedalia and for the full day of Yom Kippur. Money in any form is not handled or carried on Jewish holidays according to Jewish law, but promises to make donations are allowed.\n\nIn contemporary Judaism, many congregations offer a Selichot service near midnight on the Saturday night \"preceding\" the Ten Days of Repentance. This, often short, prayer service serves as a preamble to the High Holy Days (Yom Kippur in particular). The service itself comprises prayers of atonement, the liturgy of which may be found in many machzorim (prayer books for the High Holy Days) or in special prayer books or pamphlets known as \"slechot.\"\n\n\"Shabbat Shuvah\" (\"Sabbath [of] Return\" שבת שובה) or \"Shabbat Teshuvah\" (\"Sabbath [of] Repentance\" שבת תשובה) refers to the Shabbat that occurs during the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. This Shabbat is named after the first word of the Haftarah that is read on that day, , and literally means \"Return!\" The alternative name, \"Shabbat Teshuvah\" (Sabbath of Repentance), is due to its being one of the Aseret Yemei Teshuvah (Ten Day of Repentance).\n\nSome Jews and communities have the custom of performing Kapparot during a weekday, a ritual in which either a chicken or money is swung over one's head usually three times as a symbolic atonement by the chicken or the money \"assuming the sins\" of the one performing the ritual. This custom is not required by the Torah.\n\nOn Yom Kippur additional prohibitions are observed similar to the fast of Tisha B'Av, as detailed in the Jewish oral tradition (\"Mishnah\" tractate \"Yoma\" 8:1) because the Torah stipulates that ועניתם את נפשתיכם \"and you shall afflict your souls\" and the Talmud therefore defines self-imposed \"affliction\" during Yom Kippur only, as follows:\n\n\nmaking the culmination of the ten days a very serious set of observances. \n\nYom Kippur is over at sundown on the tenth day at nightfall but is 'confirmed' as concluded after the recitation of the Kaddish following the end of \"ne'ila\" (\"closing\") prayer and the shofar is sounded.

Traditional solemn tunes are used in the prayers. The musaf service on Rosh Hashana has nine blessings; the three middle blessings include biblical verses attesting to sovereignty, remembrance and the shofar, which is sounded 100 times during the service.\n\nDuring these days some are stricter and eat only baked goods produced with a Jew involved in the baking process known as Pat Yisrael even though during the year they eat any kosher baked goods known as \"pat paltar\".

{"id": "2035450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035450", "title": "Cruck", "text": "Cruck\n\nA cruck or crook frame is a curved timber, one of a pair, which support the roof of a building, historically used in England. This type of timber framing consists of long, generally naturally curved, timber members that lean inwards and form the ridge of the roof. These posts are then generally secured by a horizontal beam which then forms an \"A\" shape. Several of these \"crooks\" are constructed on the ground and then lifted into position. They are then joined together by either solid walls or cross beams which aid in preventing 'racking' (the action of each individual frame going out of square with the rest of the frame, and thus risking collapse).\n\nThe term \"crook\" or \"cruck\" comes from Middle English ', from Old Norse ', meaning \"hook\". This is also the origin of the word \"crooked\", meaning bent, twisted or deformed, and also the crook used by shepherds and symbolically by bishops.\n\nCrucks were chiefly used in the medieval period for structures such as houses and large tithe barns, which were entirely timber-framed. They were also often used for the roofs of stone-walled buildings such as churches. However, these bent timbers were comparatively rare, as they were also in high demand for the shipbuilding industry. \n\nWhere naturally curved timbers were convenient and available, carpenters continued to use them at much later dates. For instance, base crucks are found in the roofs of the residential range of Staple Inn Buildings, Nos. 337 – 338, High Holborn, London. This is dated by documented records to 1586, with significant alterations in 1886 (under Alfred Waterhouse) and further restorations in 1936, and 1954–55. Despite these changes Cecil Hewett, an authority on English Historic Carpentry, has stated that these 16th-century crucks are original.\n\nThe large main barn of the manor house Barlow Woodseats Hall features what is claimed to be the longest continuously roofed cruck barn in Derbyshire, and possibly even in the United Kingdom.\n\nAn example of a Yorkshire cruck barn complete with a heather-thatched roof can be found in Appletreewick. The crucks or cruck \"blades\" are a single oak tree riven (split) in two to form an equally shaped A frame.\n\nRare examples of cruck framing are found on continental Europe such as in Belgium, Flanders, Northern France and the Corrèze region of France. No cruck frames are known to have been built in North America though there are rare examples of what may be an upper cruck or knee rafters.\n\nDuring the current revival of green-oak framing for new building work, which has occurred mainly since approximately 1980 in the UK, genuine cruck frames have quite often been included in traditionally carpentered structures. \n\nThere are also some fine, historically authentic reconstructions. For instance, Tithe Barn, Pilton, Glastonbury, whose original roof was destroyed by lightning, has been carefully rebuilt in 2005 from curved oaks. The necessary trees were sought out, using special templates, in English woodlands.\n\n\nThe apex of a cruck frame also helps to define the style and region of the cruck. Different types include the butt apex, halved, housed, yoke, and crossed forms.\n\n\n\n"}

This is Gorka's fifth album and unlike the previous four recorded in various places in the northeastern United States, \"Out of the Valley\" was recorded at Imagine Sound Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. This is also the first of several Gorka albums to employ the talents of guitarist/producer John Jennings.\n\nGuest vocalists include country music superstars Kathy Mattea and Mary Chapin Carpenter among others. Guest instrumentalists include guitarist Leo Kottke, Fairport Convention drummer Dave Mattacks, and bluegrass virtuosos Jerry Douglas and Tim O'Brien. A notable absence is the voice of Lucy Kaplansky whose background vocals have been a feature of all other Gorka albums.\n\nThis is perhaps Gorka's most commercial album and is his only work to have ranked on one of \"Billboard's\" charts. It peaked at # 26 on the \"Heatseekers\" chart. Reactions to the increased level of commercial production in Gorka's folk music were varied. Allmusic states: \"...many of the dense musical\narrangements do a disservice to his powerful voice.\" Meanwhile a review in \"Sing Out!\" reads: \"...nowhere does star power take precedence over bringing out the best in these songs. Congratulations are due to both Gorka and to producer John Jennings.\" The songs are more upbeat than some of Gorka's earlier works and generally better suited to a more glossy production. Gorka's writing, however, remains strong. \"Sing Out!\" states that \"\"Out of the Valley\"... reveals a mature artist with a keen sense of observation with equal parts humor and compassion.\" \"The Valley\" in Gorka's title is a reference to Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley and as with Gorka's previous albums a number of songs feature stories and characters that are based on Gorka's experiences living in this area that surrounds Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n\nHigh Street Records also offered a limited release promotional EP titled Motor Folkin with alternative mixes of songs from the \"Out of the Valley\" recording sessions.\n\nAll songs written by John Gorka except where noted.\n\n\"Good Noise\" is an upbeat gospel-tinged song that promotes a bright optimism not often found in Gorka's earlier work. High Street Records promoted this song with a music video that appeared on media such as CMT. Cover versions include a recording of the song by the Scottish folk band, The John Wright Band for the 2001 album, \"Language of the Heart\".\n\nMusicians:\n\nGorka never explicitly names the subject of \"That's Why\". Listeners, however, are able to ascertain much from various references. The following lines about a commemorative stamp are just one example:\n\"That's Why\" is not Gorka's only tribute to the \"King of Rock'n'Roll\", for another see the 2006 Billy C. Wirtz album, \"Sermon from Bethlehem\", for a recording of \"The King & I\", a tune penned by Gorka and Fred Koller.\n\nMusicians:\n\nAccording to \"Sing Out!\" \"Carnival Knowledge\" is a tragic story of a circus clown whose grease paint provides his only escape from the depths of low self-esteem.\"\n\nMusicians:\n\n\"Talk About Love\" is another one of Gorka's happy blue-inflected love songs. As with the track, \"Good Noise\" the liner notes describe Jonell Mossers' work as \"Testifying vocals\".\n\nMusicians:\n\n\n\"Sing Out!\" called \"Furniture\", a \"song of critical self-examination without self-pity.\"\n\nMusicians:\n\nAccording to \"Allmusic\", \"the track \"Mystery to Me\" reveals [Gorka's] wicked sense of humor about the mysteries of attraction.\"\n\nMusicians:\n\nLike many songs in Gorka's earlier catalog, \"Out of the Valley\" draws on Gorka's experiences living in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. It was sometime around the time of the recording of this album that Gorka himself moved out of \"The Valley\" and began the transition to his current home in Minnesota.\n\nMusicians:\n\nMusicians\n\nMusicians:\n\n\"Flying Red Horse\" has been described as a \"fantasy of freedom inspired by a gas station sign.\" Gorka shares his vision of the Mobil logo coming to life and escaping to the sky. While the song is delivered in a serious tone Gorka manages to inject a fair amount of humor:\n\nA reviewer for \"Allmusic\" preferred the relatively simple production. He wrote that this track, \"in which the only instrumentation is a guitar and the voices of Gorka and Mary Chapin Carpenter, demonstrates an amazing imagination and an ability to captivate with great storytelling.\"\n\nMusicians:\n\n\"Sing Out!\" stated that \"Up Until Then\" offers a scene of local characters \"that would make Tom Waits proud.\"\n\nMusicians:\n\nMusicians:\n\nProduction:\n\nMotor Folkin' was a 1994 limited issue promotional EP released by High Street Records. Perhaps the track of greatest interest from this release was the live solo version of \"Furniture\" recorded at \"The Mountain\", KMTT in Seattle, Washington. Remixes of \"Mystery to Me\" and \"Good Noise\" were also included, as was an in-studio recording of \"Campaign Trail\". A final mix of \"Campaign Trail\" was not released until 1996 on Gorka's \"Between Five and Seven\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2035467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035467", "title": "Such, Such Were the Joys", "text": "Such, Such Were the Joys\n\n\"Such, Such Were the Joys\" is a long autobiographical essay by the English writer George Orwell.\n\nIn the piece, Orwell describes his experiences between the ages of eight and thirteen, in the years before and during World War I (from September 1911 to December 1916), while a pupil at a preparatory school: St Cyprian's, in the seaside town of Eastbourne, in Sussex. The essay offers various reflections on the contradictions of the Edwardian middle and upper class world-view, on the psychology of children, and on the experience of oppression and class conflict.\n\nIt was probably drafted in 1939–40, revised in 1945–46, and not completed until May or June 1948. It was first published by \"Partisan Review\" in 1952, two years after Orwell's death.\n\nThe veracity of the stories it contains about life at St. Cyprian's has been challenged by a number of commenters, including Orwell's contemporaries at the school and biographers, but its powerful writing and haunting observations have made it one of Orwell's most commonly anthologised essays.\n\nThe title of the essay is taken from \"The Echoing Green\", one of William Blake's \"Songs of Innocence\" which Orwell's mother had read to him when they lived at Henley:\n\nThe allusion is never explained in Orwell's text, but it is grimly ironic, since Orwell recollects his early boarding school experiences with unvarnished realism. St Cyprian's was, according to him, a \"world of force and fraud and secrecy,\" in which the young Orwell, a shy, sickly and unattractive boy surrounded by pupils from families much richer than his own, was \"like a goldfish\" thrown \"into a tank full of pike.\" The piece fiercely attacks the cruelty and snobbery of both his fellow pupils and of most of the adults connected with the school, — particularly the headmaster, Mr. Vaughan Wilkes, nicknamed \"Sambo,\" and his wife Cicely, nicknamed \"Flip\".\n\nOrwell describes the education he received as \"a preparation for a sort of confidence trick,\" geared entirely towards maximising his future performance in the admissions exams to leading English public schools such as Eton and Harrow, without any concern for actual knowledge or understanding. He describes the approach as amounting to being cynically 'crammed', as a 'goose is crammed for Christmas'. The process is exemplified by the 'date learning' teaching of history in which boys were encouraged to learn dates, without any understanding of 'the mysterious events they were naming.' \"1587? \"Massacre of St. Bartholomew (there is a mistake here in the book, in fact 1572)\"! 1713? \"Treaty of Utrecht\" – 1520? \"Field of the Cloth of Gold\"! and so on.\" Orwell also claims that he was accepted as a boarder at St Cyprians—at half of the usual fees—so that he might earn a scholarship that would look good in the school's publicity, and that his training relied heavily on the use of beatings, while the rich boys received preferential treatment and were exempted from corporal punishment.\n\nThe essay lashes out at the hypocrisy of the Edwardian society in which Orwell grew up and in which a boy was \"bidden to be at once a Christian and a social success, which is impossible.\" A chapter is devoted to the puritanical attitudes towards sex at the time and to the frightful consequences of the discovery of what appears to have been a case of masturbation among a group of boys at the school. On the other hand, Orwell describes the actual \"pattern of school life\" as\n\nOrwell's story is punctuated by anecdotes about the dirt and squalor surrounding him, such as the porridge at the dining hall containing \"more lumps, hairs and unexplained black things than one would have thought possible, unless someone were putting them there on purpose,\" a human turd floating in the Devonshire Baths, and a new boy's teeth turning green because of neglect.\n\nAccording to the essay, the main lesson that Orwell took away from St Cyprian's was that, for a \"weak\" and \"inferior\" person such as himself, \"to survive, or at least to preserve any kind of independence, was essentially criminal, since it meant breaking rules which you yourself recognized,\" and that he lived in a world \"where it was \"not possible\" [for him] to be good.\" In the piece, Orwell also seeks to illustrate the reflection that children live \"in a sort of alien under-water world which we can only penetrate by memory or divination,\" and he wonders whether even in more modern times, without \"God, Latin, the cane, class distinctions and sexual taboos,\" it might still be normal for schoolchildren to \"live for years amid irrational terrors and lunatic misunderstandings.\"\n\nSecondary education for the dominant classes in England since the early 19th century has been provided mainly by the fee-paying public schools. These have selective entrance by examination and offer scholarships by competitive examination, which offset all or part of the fees. The curriculum in Orwell's time, and for long after, centred on the classics. Prep schools were established from the 19th century to prepare students for these examinations and to provide a broader-based education than the traditional crammer, offering sports and additional subjects. Prep school children were often boarders, starting as early as five or as late as twelve. Boarding was, and still is, for terms of three months. Eastbourne was a popular town for preparatory schools at the turn of the 20th century because its bracing sea air was believed to be healthy, and by 1896, \"Gowland's Eastbourne Directory\" listed 76 private schools for boys and girls. An Eton scholarship was most highly prized, not just for its financial value but because it provided access to the elite intellectual cadre of King's Scholars. One of the leading prep schools of the time, Summer Fields School, set in the university town of Oxford and with which St Cyprian's eventually was to merge, won every year at least five of the available Eton scholarships.\n\nOrwell's mother sent him (as Eric Blair) to board at St Cyprian's School at the age of eight in 1911. The school had been founded twelve years earlier by the headmaster, Vaughan Wilkes, and his wife Cicely. It had moved into newly built facilities in extended grounds in 1906. Although able to charge high fees for better-off parents, the Wilkeses supported traditional families on lower incomes, particularly in the colonial service, by taking their children at considerably reduced fees. Orwell was one of several beneficiaries, who also included Cyril Connolly, Alaric Jacob, and Walter Christie. Mrs Wilkes spotted Orwell looking sad on his arrival and tried to comfort him, but noted \"there was no warmth in him\". Nor did he respond positively to being taken on a picnic the following day. Senior boys in Orwell's first year included Ian Fraser and Bolo Whistler. His early letters home report a normal catalogue of class placings, results of games, and school expeditions.\n\nIn September 1914 Cyril Connolly arrived at the school and formed a close friendship with Orwell. The First World War had just broken out, and Orwell's patriotic poem written at school was published in the \"Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard\". The war made life difficult for the school – most of the teaching staff left to fight, although one staff member Charles Edgar Loseby, later a Labour MP, returned for a period while recovering from being gassed in the trenches. The First World War had a significant effect in other ways – there was the increasing roll call of old boys killed in the trenches, Mr Wilkes spent his summer holidays driving ambulances in France, the boys knitted and put on entertainments for the injured troops camped nearby, and food shortages made feeding a challenge. Classics was taught by Mr Wilkes, while the formidable Mrs Wilkes taught English, history and scripture. The long-serving deputy, Robert Sillar, taught geography, drawing, shooting and nature studies and was highly regarded in old boys' accounts. Outings on the South Downs were a regular part of school life, and Sillar led the boys on nature study expeditions. The school had instituted a Cadet Corps, in which Orwell was an active member. Orwell recalls stealing books off Connolly and Connolly describes how they reviewed each other's poetry. Cecil Beaton vaguely recalled working on the school's war-time allotments with Orwell. During his time at school, Orwell surreptitiously collected the saucy seaside postcards that were later to figure in his essay \"The Art of Donald McGill\".\n\nIn 1916 Orwell came second in the Harrow History Prize, had another poem published in the \"Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard\", and with Connolly had his work praised by the external examiner Sir Charles Grant Robertson. In 1916 Orwell won a scholarship to Wellington College, a school with a military background appropriate for colonial service. Mr Wilkes also believed Orwell could win an Eton scholarship and would benefit from Eton College life and so he sat the Eton exam as well. Orwell headed the school prize list in 1916 with Classics, while Cyril Connolly won the English prize, Cecil Beaton won the drawing prize, Walter Christie won the history prize and Rupert Lonsdale won the scripture prize. Henry Longhurst, Lord Pollington and Lord Malden were among the winners of other class prizes. Other activities in which Orwell was involved included narrowly missing winning the diving competition, playing the part of Mr Jingle in the school play, and being commended as a useful member of the 1st XI cricket team. Although he had won an Eton scholarship, this was subject to a place becoming available. Instead of going to Wellington he stayed at St Cyprian's for an additional term in the hope that a place at Eton would materialise. As this had not happened by the end of term, he went on to Wellington in January. However, after he had been there for nine weeks, an Eton place became available, which Orwell took.\n\nOn sending a version of the essay to Warburg, in May 1947, Orwell stated that he had written the \"long autobiographical sketch\" partly as a \"sort of pendant\" to the publication in 1938 of \"Enemies of Promise\", an autobiographical work by Cyril Connolly, and at Connolly's request. Connolly, who had been Orwell's companion at St Cyprian's and later at Eton, had written an account of St Cyprian's which, though cynical, was fairly appreciative compared to Orwell's. In his letter to Warburg, Orwell wrote that he thought his essay \"really too libellous to print\", adding that it should be printed \"when the people most concerned are dead\". The libel report for Secker & Warburg, compiled after Orwell's death, judged that well over thirty paragraphs were defamatory.\n\nSonia Orwell and Warburg both wanted to publish \"Such, Such Were the Joys\" immediately after Orwell's death, but Sir Richard Rees, who was Orwell's literary executor violently disagreed. He considered the work \"grossly exaggerated, badly written, and likely to harm Orwell's reputation\" and when Sonia insisted, he told her, \"You’re completely nutty about St Cyprian's\". Thereafter, Rees had no further involvement in publishing decisions. In 1952, within two years of Orwell's death a version was published in the United States in the \"Partisan Review\". In this version the school was referred to as \"Crossgates\" and the names of the headmaster and his wife altered to Mr and Mrs Simpson (\"Sim\" and his wife \"Bingo\"). Following Mrs Wilkes' death in 1967, \"Such, Such Were the Joys\" was published in the UK, but with only the name of the school and the proprietors in original form – the real names of his fellow pupils were still disguised. In the \"Completed Works\" edition (2000), the original text including all names has been restored.\n\nMost biographers have to a greater or lesser extent concluded that \"Such, Such Were the Joys\" significantly misrepresents the school and exaggerates Orwell's suffering there. David Farrer, partner of Orwell's publishers, considered it a \"gross distortion of what took place\".\n\nOf his contemporaries, Cecil Beaton wrote of the piece \"It is hilariously funny, but it is exaggerated\". Connolly, on reviewing Stansky & Abraham's interpretation, wrote \"I was at first enchanted as by anything which recalls one's youth but when I went to verify some references from my old reports and letters I was nearly sick... In the case of St Cyprian's and the Wilkes whom I had so blithely mocked I feel an emotional disturbance... The Wilkeses were true friends and I had caricatured their mannerisms (developed as a kind of ritual square-bashing for dealing with generations of boys) and read mercenary motives into much that was just enthusiasm.\" Walter Christie and Henry Longhurst went further and wrote their own sympathetic accounts of the school in response to Orwell's and voiced their appreciation for the formidable Mrs Wilkes. Robert Pearce, researching the papers of another former pupil, made a comprehensive study from the perspective of the school, investigating school records and other pupils' accounts. While some features were universal features of prep school life, he concluded that Orwell's depiction bore little relation to reality and that Orwell's defamatory allegations were unsupportable. Davison writes \"If one is looking for a factual account for life at St Cyprian's, this is not the place to seek it.\"\n\nOn Orwell's claimed state of misery, Jacintha Buddicom, who knew him well at the time, also raised a strong challenge. She wrote \"I can guarantee that the 'I' of \"Such, Such were the Joys\" is quite unrecognisable as Eric as we knew him then\", and \"He was a philosophical boy, with varied interests and a sense of humour—which he was inclined to indulge when referring to St Cyprian's in the holidays.\"\n\n"}

He went out to Wayne Mardle 2-4 in 2005. He won his first match at the World Championship at his third attempt in 2006. He was seeded 12th for the event, and beat Warren Parry before losing 0-4 to Dennis Smith in the next round.\n\nHe had slipped to 16th in the world rankings for the 2007 World Championship, when he was surprisingly beaten by 19-year-old Dutch player Rico Vonck, thus continuing his poor run at the tournament. He started the year ranked 15th in the world, but had fallen to 32 by November, which put him in danger of failing to qualify for the 2008 World Championship. However, he reached the semi-final of the Ireland Open Classic in September, and won the non-ranked Gleneagle Irish Masters in early November, thus hinting at an upturn in form. He also reached the semi-finals of the PDC German Darts Championship.\nIn the 2008 PDC World Darts Championship, Walsh defeated Adrian Gray in the first round, setting up a second-round match with Taylor. Walsh led Taylor 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 before Taylor won six consecutive legs to beat him 4-3. Despite losing, Walsh stated that from suffering dartitis to pushing the greatest player in the world to the final set at the World Championship was a great victory in its own right.\n\nWalsh continued his good form, reaching three quarter finals including the Open Holland Masters and then reached the last 32 stage of the US Open and the UK Open. He followed up with a semi final showing in the PDPA Players Championship Las Vegas and then qualified for the 2008 Las Vegas Desert Classic the next day. He beat Bill Davis in the first round before losing to James Wade. He then reached the second round of the 2008 World Matchplay, defeating Colin Lloyd in the opening match of the tournament but lost to Kevin McDine. He reached the second round of the World Grand Prix, beating Steve Beaton in the first round before losing to Terry Jenkins. Walsh missed out on qualifying for the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts but bounced back to reach the semi finals of the inaugural Championship League Darts, winning group eight and then placing second in the winners group, eventually losing to Mervyn King. He then reached the quarter finals of the 2008 European Darts Championship and reached the final of the PDPA Players Championship Holland 2, losing to Wade.\nWalsh defeated Jamie Caven 3-2 in the first round of the 2009 PDC World Championship, narrowly missing out on a nine dart finish on the way. In the second round he lost 4-2 to King. On 17 January, Walsh hit a nine dart finish in the Eddie Cox Memorial Players Championship in Gibraltar against Caven to win the deciding leg of their first round match. Having rolled over for four Players Championships, Walsh won £1,600 for the nine-darter.\n\nWalsh won his first PDC title in two years, when he won the Coventry Players Championship on 28 March 2009 beating Taylor 6-4 in the final. He added another title with his second career UK Open Regional in Derby, by winning the East Midlands region 6-5 over Raymond van Barneveld.\n\nWalsh was 12th seed for the 2010 PDC World Championship, however he only made the first round after losing 3-2 to former World Champion Mark Webster.\nWalsh qualified for the 2011 Grand Slam of Darts as the highest ranked player from the PDC Order of Merit not already invited. He progressed through Group A with victories over Tony O'Shea and Michael van Gerwen but finished second after losing to Scott Waites.

Walsh played Kevin Painter in the Last 32 and came back from 1–3 to level the match at 3–3. He couldn't keep his momentum going, however, as he lost the deciding set by 3 legs to 0 to exit the tournament 3–4. At the World Matchplay, Walsh beat Colin Osborne 10–8 in the first round, before being comprehensively beaten 4–13 by James Wade in the last 16. Despite winning the first set in his first round match against Robert Thornton at the World Grand Prix, he only took one more leg and lost 1–2. Walsh qualified from Group 8 of the Championship League with a 6–5 victory against Steve Beaton. However, he finished bottom of the eight man Winners Group, winning just one of his seven matches. Walsh was whitewashed 0–5 in his opening Group H game of the Grand Slam of Darts, but came back to defeat both Wayne Jones and Christian Kist 5–4. However, his heavy defeat and narrow wins meant that he failed to qualify for the knockout stage on leg difference. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Walsh was 23rd on the Order of Merit, inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals.

He lost 4–5 to Lee Palfreyman in the second round of the UK Open. He failed to qualify for the World Matchplay for the first time in his career and the World Grand Prix for the first time since 2007 due to falling out of the top 16 on the Order of Merit and not winning enough games through the PDC Pro Tour.\nIn October, Walsh reached the quarter-finals of a Pro Tour event for the first time in a year at the 11th Players Championship as he beat the likes of Andy Hamilton and Newton, before his run was ended with a 6–4 defeat against Robert Thornton. He lost 5–0 to Robert Thornton and 5–1 to Andy Hamilton at the Grand Slam of Darts, before a consolation 5–2 victory over Justin Pipe but Walsh was already resigned to finishing bottom of the group.\n\nAt the 2014 World Championship Walsh missed five darts to extend his first round match against Jarkko Komula into a final set as he lost 3–1. He dropped to world number 31 after the event concluded and was defeated 9–5 by Mark Webster in the third round of the UK Open. Walsh failed to advance beyond the last 32 of any event after this. He fell to world number 41 ahead of the 2015 World Championship, outside of the top 32 who automatically qualify and could not claim a place via any other route to break a streak of 11 consecutive appearances in the event. 2015 also marked the first UK Open not to feature Walsh (he had played in each one since its inception in 2003) after he failed to win enough matches to qualify. He did qualify for four European Tour events with two first round and two second round exits adding a total of £5,000 to his ranking.\n\nWalsh was 65th on the Order of Merit after the 2016 World Championship, just outside the top 64 who remain on tour and so entered Q School. Despite losing in the final round to Vincent Kamphuis on the last day, Walsh had done more than enough to win his place back right away as he topped the Q School Order of Merit. At the 10th Players Championship in July, Walsh reached his first quarter-final in over two years, but lost 6–1 to Andrew Gilding. This helped him qualify for the Finals and, in what was his PDC major event since February 2014, he was edged out 6–5 by Josh Payne in the opening round.\n\nHe has won six non-televised PDC titles: the Welsh Regional final of the UK Open in September 2005, the Gleneagle Irish Masters in November 2007, the Coventry Players Championship and the UK Open East Midlands Regional plus two more Players Championships in Barnsley beating Jamie Caven and in Germany beating Andy Hamilton 6-5.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2035515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035515", "title": "Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)", "text": "Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)\n\nSymphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68, is a symphony written by Johannes Brahms. Brahms spent at least fourteen years completing this work, whose sketches date from 1854. Brahms himself declared that the symphony, from sketches to finishing touches, took 21 years, from 1855 to 1876. The premiere of this symphony, conducted by the composer's friend Felix Otto Dessoff, occurred on 4 November 1876, in Karlsruhe, then in the Grand Duchy of Baden. A typical performance lasts between 45 and 50 minutes.\n\nBrahms began composing a D minor symphony in 1854, but this work underwent radical change before much of it was finally recast as his first Piano Concerto, also in D minor. The long gestation of the C minor Symphony which would eventually be his first, may be attributed to two factors. First, Brahms's self-critical fastidiousness led him to destroy many of his early works. Second, there was an expectation from Brahms's friends and the public that he would continue \"Beethoven's inheritance\" and produce a symphony of commensurate dignity and intellectual scope – an expectation that Brahms felt he could not fulfill easily in view of the monumental reputation of Beethoven.\n\nIt was probably 1868 when Brahms finally realized what would become the final structure of his first Symphony. In September of that year, he sent a card to his lifelong friend Clara Schumann sketching the Alphorn tune which would emerge in the symphony's Finale, along with the famous message \"Thus blew the shepherd's horn today!\" Despite the evidence of the work's development, the symphony would not premiere for eight more years, in 1876.\n\nFritz Simrock, Brahms's friend and publisher, did not receive the score until after the work had been performed in three cities – and Brahms still wished trial performances in at least three more.\n\nThe manuscript to the first movement apparently does not survive, yet the remainder has been reproduced in miniature facsimile by Dover Publications. The autograph manuscript of the second, third, and fourth movements is held by the Morgan Library & Museum in New York City.\n\nThe symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones (fourth movement only), timpani and the string section.\n\nThe symphony is in four movements, marked as follows:\nThe first movement is in sonata form with an extended introduction.\n\nUnique among Brahms symphonies, the First Symphony is ushered in via a formal introduction (an 1862 score of the symphony originally started with the Allegro section). After a processional opening section featuring chaotic syncopated rhythms underpinned by pulsating timpani, the woodwinds and pizzicato strings play with thematic phrases to be fully explored in the following exposition. A short and stormy return to the original development, this time in the dominant of G and supported by rolling timpani, is finally followed by further melodic introductions played by oboe, flute and cellos before resolving in a drawn-out transitional passage ending with a plucked G note in the cellos.\n\nThe exposition begins abruptly, echoing the introduction's plucked final note with an orchestral exclamation, followed by a short motto which leads to the main theme, which is initially played, stridently, by the violins. The overall mood is \"savagely energetic\" and \"scherzo-like\" in time. As the responsibility for the main theme shifts from the violins to the woodwinds, the strings and timpani begin to sound out a da-da-da-DUM rhythm which is strongly reminiscent of the \"fate\" rhythm of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.\n\nAn extended transition leads to the arrival of the key of E major which in turn introduces the flowing and heart-easing second theme. This theme, which is related to the motto used to open the movement, is carried out in the wind section, led by oboe and clarinet with support from the bassoon and eventually the French horns. Strong intervention from the violas ends this peaceful passage with a descending minor key sequence which opens to a new closing theme leading up to a final bombastic passage wrapping up the exposition. The score then calls for a full repeat, which requires an abrupt return to C minor.\n\nThe action in the development section begins with a full step descent into B major, and instability ensues as interplay between the \"fate\" motif and phrases from the original theme are played off each other. A series of modulations, each seeming to lead further away from the tonic, eventually leads the path back to the recapitulation. Starting with a murky rumble in the basses, the music gathers strength with a thrilling set of arpeggios in the violins with support from the brass, which repeat the \"fate\" motif with great alacrity. Finally, a \"shocking digression\" in the bass line leads to a modulation to F, setting the stage for the recapitulation.\n\nA somewhat nebulous start to the recapitulation is followed by a foreshortened restatement of the first theme, allowing the music to proceed in the tonic, rather than taking up the tonal progressions originally followed in the exposition. The coda begins with pizzicato strings which quickly decrescendo, leading to a set of modulations played out in the strings with their bows leading to the closing cadence. The movement ends peacefully in C major.\n\nThe E-major second movement is in modified ternary form (A–B–A). It features significant solo passages from oboe and first chair violin.\n\nLike the second movement, the third movement is in ternary form. It is composed of the Allegretto and contrasting trio section, followed by a reprise of the Allegretto material and coda. A notable aspect of this movement is Brahms’s careful attention to symmetry.\n\nThe form could be described as:\n\nThe Allegretto is in the key of A major and begins with a calm, stepwise melody in the clarinet. The four-bar figure is extended to an irregular five bars through a small bridge between the phrases by the strings. The clarinet rounds off the A theme in the Allegretto with an inversion of the first five bars heard.\nThe B theme enters in measure 11 and features a descending dotted-eighth-note pattern in the flute, clarinet, and bassoon with the strings echoing the rhythm in rising and falling figures. After eight measures, A appears with the violins iterating the first theme and a longer, chromatic bridge section that extends the phrase structure to seven bars. B is presented with an extension into C.\n\nThe C and D themes differ from the first two in that they are shorter and more angular rhythmically. The A and B themes feature an almost constant eighth-note pizzicato in the strings, whereas C and D are more complex with an interlocking sixteenth-note pattern accompanying the winds. Movement from the major mode to F minor also marks these sections as apart from preceding material. This obvious contrast in character and mood can lend one to think of the C and D sections as a sort of trio within the first Allegretto section in the larger ternary form displayed by the movement as a whole. The symmetry within one section reflects the symmetry of the whole.\n\nA closes off the first major section with the clarinet stating the first theme, much as it did in the beginning, finishing with a transition to the trio.\n\nThe Trio offers a change of key, as well as a change of time. The key moves to B major, an enharmonic minor third away from A. This key movement balances with the C and D sections in F minor, also a minor third away from the home key but in the opposite direction. The time signature changes from a stately to a more pastoral and dancelike . The flute, oboe, and bassoon introduce a joyful melody in stepwise motion as in the A theme. The strings add a downward three-note arpeggio. These two motives make up the bulk of the trio material. Restatement and development of those themes ensue until the brass and winds join together for a final repeat of the melody. The second ending brings the orchestra back into time and to A.\n\nA major difference between A and the earlier iterations of A is the lingering effect of the trio upon the movement. The monotone call from the opening of the trio melody appears over the clarinet melody in the flute, oboe, and bassoon. The rhythmic effect of triplets also invades the pure eighth-note world of the A theme, producing polyrhythms. Instead of the inversion of the theme we expect in the second phrase of A, the strings take over and offer an entirely different melody, but with essentially the same contour as the inversion. B occupies a significantly larger space of the reprise than it does in the previous Allegretto. It leads through an extended transition to the last, quiet statement of A in unison by the strings. Strings of dotted eighth notes end the movement proper with ideas from the B theme.\n\nThe entry to the coda is marked \"poco a poco più tranquillo\" and the movement ends with the gentle throbbing of triplets quoted from the trio section. The final few bars end somewhat abruptly with the downward arpeggio of the strings in the trio finishing on the downbeat of a new bar.\n\nAs with the first movement, Brahms begins the final movement with a formal introduction in C minor. The finale, noted for its \"vast scope\"...\"resolves all the tensions that the first movement had raised but was (magnificently) unable to dissipate.\" Except for the cut-time () Più allegro coda, the movement is in common () meter.\n\nPART I (Adagio - C minor). The extended introduction begins with a murky and ominous descending four-note sequence in the strings, which is followed by a tragically-rendered \"anticipation\" of the movement's joyous 'Alphorn' theme. This is followed by a passage of pizzicato string notes, plucked in two-note groups passed between the high- and low-pitched instrument sections, which rises in tempo and volume until the prior tragic theme re-emerges in a short reprise. This is followed by a second passage of pizzicato strings, which is resolved in a sudden shift to a rising set of modulations in the woodwinds followed by a set of rapid arpeggios in the strings leading to the grand entrance of the Alphorn theme in C major.\n\nPART II (Più andante - C major). The horns, including the first entry of the trombones, introduce the Alphorn theme with a \"noble and grand presentation\" over a \"shimmering cloudscape\" of strings, in \"one of the classic orchestral moments of the nineteenth century\". As the horns conclude the performance of the Alphorn tune, it is given to the flutes to recite. This leads to a mellow chorale in the brass, to be concluded with the transition to the exposition. The first three notes of the Alphorn theme create are presented in a swelling crescendo which resolves in a drawn out conclusion over pounding timpani followed by a quiet chord dying in the brass.\n\nThe main theme commences immediately in C major, a \"famous, grandly striding tune\" which was likened by many to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony \"Freude\" theme. This was an assertion which irritated Brahms, but which he nevertheless acknowledged--\"any ass can see that\". The theme is introduced in the violins and violas in alto register accompanied softly by horns and underpinned by pizzicato bass. After a few bars, the strings undulate through the second phrase with support from the bassoons. The woodwinds then pick up the song, with the strings in pizzicato accompaniment with gently trilling timpani. Finally, the full orchestra is unleashed in an energetic rendition which quickly fragments into transitional struggle. A passage led by arpeggio strings accompanied by bassoon and contrabassoon follows, including a brief variation of the Alphorn tune leading directly to the second theme.\n\nThe second theme arrives as a falling four note figure related to the opening sequence and related to the Alphorn tune. The theme is introduced softly in the low strings, and elaborated upon by the violins. The second statement of the theme is joined first by the bassoons, followed by the flutes and oboes. After an energetic transitional passage in the strings, the oboe continues with an inverted variation of the theme in G major but eventually modulates back to E minor, leading to the conclusion of the exposition.\n\nThe development section begins with a full restatement of the movement's main theme; the last time it will be heard in its entirety. The development section in fact provides a full recapitulation of both of the symphony's main themes and leads directly to the movement's coda; there is no separate recapitulation section in the movement.\n\nThe recapitulation of the main theme is 'richly scored', with full strings carrying the tune supported by 'punctuating chords' in the winds and gently rolling timpani. The oboe leads a transition to E-flat and a development-heavy section marked by key instability and fragmented restatements and elaborations of phrases in the melody. These are parried between the winds, led by flutes, and (softly) by the horns and bassoons with pizzicato strings providing additional momentum. An energetic restatement of the theme by the orchestra follows, but this quickly digresses into a transitional section marked by string arpeggios and the arrival of a new thematic element for further development.\n\nA distinctive 'turning' motif, derived from the main theme, appears in the winds, traded between flute and oboe with lush string harmony accompaniment. This is followed by an energetic passage, mainly in the strings, featuring falling arpeggio figures and elements of the main theme recited in C minor/F minor.\n\nThe turning motif returns in a thrilling rendition led by the horns, followed by powerful syncopated descending figures which are traded between the strings and the wind instruments. This finally leads back to a rendition of the Alphorn theme, which begins tragically in the strings, but is recovered by a soothing harmonic motion initiated in the winds and followed by a major key restatement in the horns, this time without the shimmering strings of the exposition. The music begins to lose momentum as the strings play a descending procession that sounds as if it may lead to closing material for the section. \n\nInstead, the second theme immediately follows in a full recapitulation, which is restated with little change from its original appearance in the exposition. However, after the theme's restatement is complete, a subtle change in the final passage avoids the key modulation taken in the exposition section, which allows the section to end in C minor. A lengthy coda follows without pause, which returns to C major, restates the chorale from the introduction, and ends with a triumphant pair of plagal cadences.\n\nThe value and importance of Brahms's achievements were recognized by Vienna's most powerful critic, the staunchly conservative Eduard Hanslick. The conductor Hans von Bülow was moved in 1877 to call the symphony \"Beethoven's Tenth\", due to perceived similarities between the work and various compositions of Beethoven. It is often remarked that there is a strong resemblance between the main theme of the finale of Brahms's First Symphony and the main theme of the finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Also, Brahms uses the rhythm of the \"fate\" motto from the opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. This rather annoyed Brahms; he felt that this amounted to accusations of plagiarism, whereas he saw his use of Beethoven's idiom in this symphony as an act of conscious homage. Brahms himself said, when comment was made on the similarity with Beethoven, \"any ass can see that\". Nevertheless, this work is still sometimes (though rarely) referred to as \"Beethoven's Tenth\".\n\nThe symphony begins with a broad introduction wherein three key elements are heard simultaneously: the low drumming, the rising figure in the strings, and the falling figure in the winds. This introduction was constructed after the remainder of the piece had been scored. The Allegro section of the movement is a large orchestral sonata, wherein musical ideas are stated, developed, and restated with altered relationships among them.\n\nThe second and third movements are lighter in tone and tension than the first and last movements. The slow movement, Andante sostenuto, exhibits gentle lyricism through three sections, the third of which is a new treatment of the themes from the first. The long violin solo is reminiscent of some of Beethoven's later works: the late quartets and \"Missa Solemnis\". The third, scherzo-like movement, has an easy spirit yet is full of complex rhythms and interwoven textures.\n\nThe fourth movement begins with a slow introduction, where a new melody competes with \"gloomy dramatic rhetoric\". In the \"Più andante\" section, the horns and timpani introduce a tune that Brahms heard from an Alpine shepherd with the words, \"High on the hill, deep in the dale, I send you a thousand greetings!\" This movement contains melodies reminiscent of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The last section—Allegro non troppo, ma con brio—contains a grand melody in a major key, as the novel, Beethoven-like main subject of the grand finale.\n\n\n"}

Initially fronted by Francis Dunnery, the band split in 1990, eventually returning in 2006 with new frontman John Mitchell. This lineup toured and produced two further albums plus two live albums.\n\nBy May 2019, confusion emerged surrounding the future of the band: while drummer Bob Dalton stated the band will no longer write/record or play live, frontman John Mitchell said that both he and keyboard player John Beck are writing new material and were not consulted about the split, only finding out through social media.\n\nDescribed as having \"a strong art-rock tendency\" by AllMusic, website Über Rock stated, \"It Bites have always been one of the more curious cases of the progressive rock world. Their first impression on us back in the 1980s was that of a pop band. But a pop band doing what no pop band had the right to do – successfully mix catchy tunes with complex musicianship and, god forbid, distorted guitars.\"\n\nThe band's musical development can be split into four clear phases – their \"The Big Lad in the Windmill\" phase (in which they embraced various varieties of contemporary pop, funk, sophisti-pop, and Queen-style glam rock and processed it through their progressive rock influences); the \"Once Around the World\" phase (in which they produced 1970s style progressive rock with a 1980s contemporary producer-pop gloss); the \"Eat Me in St. Louis\" phase (during which they produced detailed hard rock songs with elements of heavy metal and glam rock); and the reunion phase with John Mitchell (in which they played a more measured melodic progressive rock similar to that of the \"Once Around The World\" phase).\n\nOriginally formed by drummer Bob Dalton, bass player Dick Nolan and guitarist/singer Francis Dunnery, It Bites started out in early 80s in the market town of Egremont in Cumbria, UK. Keyboard player John Beck from Whitehaven joined the group later in 1982, and for a short period of time It Bites also featured saxophonist Howard \"H\" Smith, a period in which the band worked playing gigs at nightclubs around Cumbria.\n\nThe band then split up at 1983, when Dalton and Nolan moved to Birmingham, Dunnery to London and Beck to Manchester. One year later, It Bites reunited in 1984 after a meetup in Egremont, and this time opted to relocate entirely to London.\n\nAll four members moved into a squat in Peckham and spent a year living hand-to-mouth and writing original material. Bob Dalton later commented \"it was actually the perfect situation because all we could afford to do was write songs 24/7. All that time was the making of us. We became strong writers and strong players.\" Their demo tape eventually secured them a management deal with Martyn Mayhead (at WEA Records), and shortly afterwards a recording contract with Virgin Records.\n\nIn March 1986, It Bites released their first single \"All in Red\", which only charted modestly. Their second single, \"Calling All the Heroes\", was released in June 1986 and became a big hit, reaching No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart and gaining the band a huge amount of radio play and many television appearances (including \"Top of the Pops\", \"Wogan\", and \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\"). The third single, \"Whole New World\", also charted, but not at such a high position peaking at number 54. All three singles appeared on the first It Bites album \"The Big Lad in the Windmill\" (produced by Alan Shacklock), which was released in the summer of 1986 but met with only moderate commercial success, despite charting at number 35.\n\nThe band toured with Go West and Marillion in late 1987, played major European outdoor festivals (including the Montreaux Jazz Festival, broadcast live across Europe by Swiss TV) and supported Robert Plant in early 1988. This diverse set of support slots revealed a problem in marketing the band which would last throughout their career. It Bites' blend of contemporary 1980s producer-pop, progressive rock and hard rock (setting glossy keyboards and massed harmony vocals against heavy drumming, complex time signatures and Allan-Holdsworth-inspired guitar solos) would draw criticism from some music press writers who accused the band of failing to settle on a coherent direction. Despite this, the band forged a loyal and enthusiastic following in the UK.\n\nThe band began recording their second album \"Once Around The World\" with producer Mark Wallis in mid-1987. Footage of this process was broadcast on Channel 4 TV's \"Equinox\" programme \"Twang, Bang, Kerrang!\" (which documented the history of the electric guitar. Francis Dunnery featured prominently in the programme, comparing his Japanese and American Fender Stratocaster guitars and discussing technique and equipment.\n\n\"Once Around The World\" was released in March 1988 and signaled a departure from the more directly pop-oriented sound of It Bites' first album, something demonstrated explicitly by a fourteen-minute title track in full progressive rock style. Virgin Records had insisted on some more pop-orientated sessions with producer Steve Hillage which resulted in the minor hit singles \"Kiss Like Judas\" (February 1988) and \"Midnight\" (April 1988). The first single from the album \"Old Man and the Angel\" (a heavily edited version of a lengthy track from the Wallis sessions) peaked at number 72 in the singles charts. Despite its split nature, the final album was consistent in tone and sound and was popular with fans. During this period, Dunnery also gained some press attention for his invention of the Tapboard, an instrument based on two paired guitar necks and using a ten-finger tapping technique to create exceptionally fast and clear melodic runs and chording.\n\nThe third album, \"Eat Me in St. Louis\" was recorded in early 1989 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany, produced by Reinhold Mack (best known for work with Queen and The Rolling Stones). The album featured a harder-edged, more guitar-orientated sound than before, with shorter, punchier songs and the direct progressive rock influences cut back. In contemporary interviews, Dunnery claimed to have become dissatisfied with the more technical and virtuosic side of It Bites' music as demonstrated on the previous album – \"That was very important to us at the time. We wanted to say to people, Look, but aren't we very clever? I can't be bothered now to write all them long sections, I just wanna see some good songs... Instead of flying around at 9,000 miles an hour, I've been playing tunes that people can remember.\" However, the band also chose to commission the artwork for \"Eat Me in St. Louis\" and its early single releases from the progressive rock sleeve artist Roger Dean, in what Dunnery admitted was a calculated attempt to play on their own \"progressive rock\" reputation and to \"annoy people.\"\n\nOn its release, \"Eat Me in St. Louis\" scored excellent reviews in rock magazines \"Kerrang!\" and \"RAW\" and spawned the minor hit single \"Still Too Young To Remember\". During this period, Virgin made strong attempts to break the band as a serious hard rock act with several re-releases and video shoots for \"Still Too Young To Remember\" and the follow-ups \"Underneath Your Pillow\" and \"Sister Sarah\". Although Virgin's efforts to boost the band's commercial profile were ultimately unsuccessful, the band still proved themselves popular as a live act, playing sell-out gigs across the UK, US and Japan, and touring with Jethro Tull and the Beach Boys. Certain band members also participated in outside projects – Nolan recording with Tony Banks (on his 1989 \"Bankstatement\" album) and Dunnery singing backing vocals on the debut Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe album during the same year.\n\nIt Bites showcased some new post-\"Eat Me in St. Louis\" material on an eight-date UK tour during March and April 1990. In June 1990, the band travelled to Los Angeles, to start writing and recording their fourth album. This was intended to be the record to break the American market, and Dunnery promised simpler songs with \"a stronger taste of blues.\" However, tensions within the band reached breaking point during the pre-rehearsal period, and it was confirmed to the band's fanclub in November 1990 that the band had parted company with Francis Dunnery. Dunnery is rumoured to have demanded full band leadership and control over material, and it's also claimed that he clashed with former creative foil John Beck to the extent that he demanded Beck's expulsion from the band.\n\nNow minus Dunnery, the remaining trio initially stayed on in Los Angeles, continuing to write and auditioning new singers. Returning to England, they recruited Lee Knott as the new It Bites singer. Knott had previously fronted the band Innocence Lost, who had played support slots to It Bites on previous UK dates. During this period, John Beck had also switched instruments, later recalling that \"at the time I think we were all sick of what was happening and wanted a total change. I was playing guitar, and a little bit of keyboards, but mainly guitar. It was a change for me, and Bob & Dick were happy doing that.\"\n\nA new It Bites album was initially scheduled for early 1991. This was ultimately replaced by a live album covering the Francis Dunnery years, \"Thank You And Goodnight\", which was mostly drawn from \"Eat Me in St. Louis\" tour recordings and released in August 1991.\n\nIn an attempt to refresh their identity, the Knott-fronted It Bites renamed themselves as Navajo Kiss and played several gigs under that name. The concerts featured new material plus a vigorous cover of \"Murder of the Planet Earth\" (from \"Eat Me in St. Louis\"). A second name-change – to Sister Sarah – followed, but the band split quietly within the year due to lack of enthusiasm from audiences. John Beck would later admit \"we found out pretty soon that people weren’t about to go along with such a change in direction.\" The various band members went their separate ways but remained in touch.\n\nAfter the split of It Bites, Beck and Dalton joined John Wetton's band for a Japanese tour and a live album, \"Chasing The Dragon\", with Beck moving on to become one of the keyboard players for the Alan Parsons Project. Nolan (who also worked for the Alan Parsons Project) eventually established himself as Ray Davies' bass player of choice. Dalton played drums for Chris Norman and Ray Davies and moved into teaching at the Academy of Contemporary Music in Guildford. Lee Knott spent some time in management (Portishead, Tricky, Underworld), and briefly resurfaced as the instrumental half of Superior (who released a couple of singles – \"Being You\" and \"Coma\" – on Virgin Records in 1998). Francis Dunnery, now based permanently in the US, re-emerged in 1991 to begin a successful solo career which continues to this day.\n\nA partial It Bites reunion appeared in 1996 in the shape of the band Unicorn Jones. This project featured John Beck, Dick Nolan and singer David Banks (who'd once auditioned for It Bites and who'd previously been part of the band Mummy Calls, whose song \"Beauty Has Her Way\" appeared on the soundtrack to the film \"The Lost Boys\"). Banks had approached Beck and Nolan to help him record an album of Burt Bacharach covers, but the trio had been sidetracked into recording a bizarre cover of Motörhead's \"Ace of Spades\" (in which they described themselves as having \"replac(ed) Lemmy's timeless vocal with David's crooner voice and transform(ed) the heavy metal trash into a dark deranged groove\"). This cover version spawned the Unicorn Jones band, which recorded one album – 1996's 'A Hundred Thousand Million Stars' – but did not play live.\n\nBeck and Dalton reunited in 2005 as members of the band Kino, a progressive rock band which also featured Marillion bass player Pete Trewavas and British prog scene regular John Mitchell (Arena and others) on lead vocals and guitar. The band initially featured former Porcupine Tree drummer Chris Maitland, but the latter was later replaced by Dalton. Kino's album 'Picture' was well-received on the British prog rock scene during 2005, and the band performed versions of the It Bites songs \"Kiss Like Judas\" and \"Plastic Dreamer\" at live concerts.\n\nOn 30 August 2003, during a solo concert at the Union Chapel in London, Francis Dunnery was joined onstage by his old It Bites band-mates for the first time since 1990. John Beck joined Dunnery for a duet on the It Bites song \"Hunting The Whale\", following which Dick Nolan and Bob Dalton also joined in for a gig finale of \"Still Too Young To Remember\". Following this, it was announced that It Bites would be getting back together to write and record a new album followed by a tour. Although some writing and initial recording did take place, the full reunion of the original lineup never materialised (apparently due to Dunnery's hectic schedule back in the United States, which affected his ability to commit to the band). The brief reunion did, however, act as a spur for some archive It Bites releases – the \"Live at Montreux\" album (originally recorded in 1987) and the DVD \"Live in Tokyo\" (featuring footage dating from the \"Eat Me in St Louis\" period.) Both were released by Bob Dalton on behalf of the band.\n\nIn 2006, It Bites opted to formally reunite, but with Beck and Dalton's Kino bandmate John Mitchell replacing Dunnery as lead singer and guitarist. According to an interview on francisdunnery.com, dated 15 October 2008, Dunnery said Bob Dalton called him out of the blue and said he was no longer wanted in the band. Dalton explained to Dunnery that they already had someone to replace him. Mitchell had been an enthusiastic It Bites fan since his teens, and was happy to take on the role. John Beck commented \"I’ve met guitarists that could manage Frank’s licks but weren’t singers, or the other way around. John’s the first to do both. It’s all been so natural, I don’t even remember agreeing to do this; it took on a life of its own.\"\n\nThe new It Bites made their live debut for a well-received tour in winter 2006, playing material from the original three It Bites albums as well as premiering three new songs – \"Memory of Water\", \"Playground\" and \"Lights\". The tour also spawned a live album called \"When The Lights Go Down\", released in 2007. The band began recording material for a new album (predominantly written by Mitchell and Beck) between 2006 and 2008, opting to self-produce. Recording sessions were completed in May 2008.\n\nOn 23 June 2008 the band announced a further change to their line-up with the departure of another founder member, bass player Dick Nolan (earlier in the year, Nolan had failed to show up for a performance at a Classic Rock Society concert, and there had been rumours of his dissatisfaction with the project). The band's statement revealed that all bass playing on the forthcoming album had in fact been performed by either John Mitchell or John Beck – in what the band referred to as \"Genesis-style\", a reference to the 1978 Genesis album \"...And Then There Were Three...\" – and that It Bites had reluctantly parted company with Nolan due to his lack of involvement and commitment. Nolan was replaced by Lee Pomeroy, an established British session bass guitarist and multi-instrumentalist who'd played with Take That, Mike Oldfield and Rick Wakeman's New English Rock Ensemble and shared It Bites' appreciation of English progressive rock musicians. Pomeroy had apparently been originally recommended to the band by Nolan.\n\nIt Bites' comeback album – \"The Tall Ships\" – was pre-released to members of the It Bites internet forum on 21 July 2008, with a full release following on Inside Out Music in October 2008. The album generally gained good reviews and was considered an excellent comeback ranking with the best of the band's previous work.\n\nIn summer 2009 It Bites played the Three Rivers Progressive Rock Festival and also toured Japan, with Level 42's guitarist Nathan King covering for an unavailable Lee Pomeroy as bass player. (King was subsequently confirmed as It Bites' regular deputising bass player for whenever Pomeroy was unavailable.) The band went on to play further British concerts in autumn 2009. A live album called \"This Is Japan\" – recorded at a Tokyo concert on 3 July 2009, and featuring King – was released in February 2010 (the album had previously been released in Japan only under the title \"It's Live\").\n\nOn 28 February 2010, the band released a re-recorded version of their 1986 hit \"Calling All The Heroes\" in order to raise funds for flood relief following the Cumbrian floods of late 2009. For this release, the band were joined by various guest performers including former members Francis Dunnery and Dick Nolan. Dunnery re-sang the opening lines of the song, with the rest of the vocals handled by John Mitchell, John Wetton (Asia, King Crimson, U.K.), Jason Perry (A) and Steve Hogarth (Marillion). Further instrumental contributions came from Nolan, Geoff Downes (Asia, Yes, Buggles), Jem Godfrey (Frost*, Atomic Kitten, etc.) and various members of Marillion. It Bites played more UK dates in March 2010 and two more dates in Japan during the same month (with Nathan King once again playing bass guitar for the Japanese concerts).\n\nDuring 2011, Mitchell and Beck spent time writing for the next It Bites album. Later in the year, the album was recorded at Mitchell's own Outhouse Studios with a full band of Mitchell, Beck, Dalton and Pomeroy. In 2012, the band announced that the album would be called \"Map of the Past\" and that it would be a concept album – \"inspired by the discovery of an old family photograph, \"Map of the Past\" is a highly personal journey that explores love, passion, jealousy, anger, remorse and loss through the eyes of a previous generation against the backdrop of Britain as it enters a new century and one of the most defining periods of its history.\" The album was released on 26 March 2012.\n\nIt Bites continued to play and tour infrequently over the following years, despite the involvement of band members with other projects (notably John Mitchell with Lonely Robot). The last full band tour was in 2013, although Mitchell and Beck performed an acoustic duo house concert tour in 2014. However, most band activity during this period was restricted to archive releases.\n\nIn 2014, all of the albums from the band's period with Francis Dunnery as frontman were released in the boxset \"Whole New World – The Virgin Albums 1986–1991\".\n\nIn 2018, the band released another archive box set, \"Live in London\", which contained full live recordings from three different concerts during the Dunnery era (recorded at the Marquee Club, the Astoria and Hammersmith Odeon). On 18 September 2018, while announcing to fans on Facebook that the pressing had now sold out, Bob Dalton also commented \"once again I have been astounded by your unwavering loyalty to It Bites and only wish there was something else on the horizon to be able to offer you but as it stands, this is the final offering from us. I sincerely hope you enjoy the new (old) CDs and it was a pleasure creating this for you.\"\n\nOn 25 May 2019, Bob Dalton announced the apparent end of the band on Facebook, stating \"unfortunately It Bites won't be touring or gigging again, we don't have any plans for anything else in the future but it was a great time and we do appreciate all of you who have followed us through the years.\" However, a few days after Dalton's announcement John Mitchell revealed that neither he nor John Beck had been consulted about dissolving It Bites, and that even if the band had split up he might still continue working with Beck. He clarified \"neither of us were consulted with or informed of the announcement – we have been looking into the possibility of releasing \"The Tall Ships\" on vinyl, and had made arrangements to write together in the coming weeks (we already have the bones of four songs written and recorded). If Bob doesn't wish to be part of this endeavour, that is entirely down to him but we would have appreciated a combined discussion and agreement before making such an announcement. Obviously this doesn't prevent John and I from making music together, whatever the outlet for this now may be!\"\n\nDuring this period, Francis Dunnery has also intermittently toured Britain with a band he refers to as \"Francis Dunnery's It Bites\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2035563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035563", "title": "Invasion of Kuwait", "text": "Invasion of Kuwait\n\nThe invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 was a two-day operation conducted by Iraq against the neighboring State of Kuwait, which resulted in the seven-month-long Iraqi occupation of the country. This invasion and Iraq's subsequent refusal to withdraw from Kuwait by a deadline mandated by the United Nations led to military intervention by a United Nations-authorized coalition of forces led by the United States. These events came to be known as the first Gulf War and resulted in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the Iraqis setting 600 Kuwaiti oil wells on fire during their retreat.\n\nIn early 1990 Iraq was accusing Kuwait of stealing Iraqi petroleum through slant drilling, although some Iraqi sources indicated Saddam Hussein's decision to attack Kuwait was made a few months before the actual invasion. Some feel there were several reasons for the Iraqi move, including Iraq's inability to pay the more than US$14 billion that it had borrowed to finance the Iran–Iraq War, and Kuwaiti high petroleum production levels which kept revenues down for Iraq. The invasion started on 2 August 1990, and within two days most of the Kuwait Armed Forces were either overrun by the Iraqi Republican Guard or fell back to neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Iraq set up a puppet government known as the \"Republic of Kuwait\" to rule over Kuwait and then annexed it outright, when Saddam Hussein announced a few days later that it was the 19th province of Iraq.\n\nWhen the Iran–Iraq War broke out, Kuwait initially stayed neutral and also tried mediating between Iran and Iraq. In 1982, Kuwait along with other Arab states of the Persian Gulf supported Iraq in order to curb the Iranian Revolutionary government. In 1982–1983, Kuwait began sending significant financial loans to Iraq. Kuwait's large-scale economic assistance to Iraq often triggered hostile Iranian actions against Kuwait. Iran repeatedly targeted Kuwaiti oil tankers in 1984 and fired weapons at Kuwaiti security personnel stationed on Bubiyan island in 1988. During the Iran–Iraq War, Kuwait functioned as Iraq's major port once Basra was shut down by the fighting. However, after the war ended, the friendly relations between the two neighbouring Arab countries turned sour for several economic and diplomatic reasons that culminated in an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.\n\nBy the time the Iran–Iraq War ended, Iraq was not in a financial position to repay the 14 billion USD it borrowed from Kuwait to finance its war and requested that Kuwait forgive the debt. Iraq argued that the war had prevented the rise of Iranian hegemony in Kuwait. However, Kuwait's reluctance to pardon the debt strained the relationship between the two countries. In late 1989, several official meetings were held between the Kuwaiti and Iraqi leaders, but they were unable to break the deadlock between the two.\n\nIn 1988 Iraq's Oil Minister, Issam al-Chalabi, stressed a further reduction in the crude oil production quota of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members so as to end the 1980s oil glut. Chalabi argued that higher oil prices would help Iraq increase its revenues and pay back its US$60 billion debt. However, given its large downstream petroleum industry, Kuwait was less concerned about the prices of crude oil and in 1989, Kuwait requested OPEC to increase the country's total oil production ceiling by 50% to 1.35 million bpd. Throughout much of the 1980s, Kuwait's oil production was considerably above its mandatory OPEC quota and this had prevented a further increase in crude oil prices. A lack of consensus among OPEC members undermined Iraq's efforts to end the oil glut and consequently prevented the recovery of its war-crippled economy. According to former Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, \"every US$1 drop in the price of a barrel of oil caused a US$1 billion drop in Iraq's annual revenues triggering an acute financial crisis in Baghdad\". Kuwait's refusal to decrease its oil production was viewed by Iraq as an act of aggression against it.\n\nThe increasingly tense relations between Iraq and Kuwait were further aggravated when Iraq alleged that Kuwait was slant-drilling across the border into Iraq's Rumaila field. The dispute over Rumaila field started in 1960 when an Arab League declaration marked the Iraq–Kuwait border 2 miles north of the southernmost tip of the Rumaila field. During the Iran–Iraq War, Iraqi oil drilling operations in Rumaila declined while Kuwait's operations increased. In 1989, Iraq accused Kuwait of using \"advanced drilling techniques\" to exploit oil from its share of the Rumaila field. Iraq estimated that US$2.4 billion worth of Iraqi oil was \"stolen\" by Kuwait and demanded compensation. Kuwait dismissed the accusations as a false Iraqi ploy to justify military action against it. Several foreign firms working in the Rumaila field also dismissed Iraq's slant-drilling claims as a \"smokescreen to disguise Iraq's more ambitious intentions\".\n\nOn 25 July 1990, only a few days before the Iraqi invasion, OPEC officials said that Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates had agreed to a proposal to limit daily oil output to 1.5 million barrels, thus potentially settling differences over oil policy between Kuwait and Iraq. At the time of the settlement, more than 100,000 Iraqi troops were deployed along the Iraq–Kuwait border, and American officials expressed little indication of decline in tensions despite the OPEC settlement.\n\nMany westerners believed that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was largely motivated by its desire to take control over the latter's vast oil reserves. The Iraqi government justified its invasion by claiming that Kuwait was a natural part of Iraq carved off as a result of British imperialism. After signing the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, the United Kingdom planned to split Kuwait from the Ottoman territories into a separate \"sheikhdom\", but this agreement was never ratified. The Iraqi government also argued that the Kuwaiti Emir was a highly unpopular figure among the Kuwaiti populace. By overthrowing the Emir, Iraq claimed that it granted Kuwaitis greater economic and political freedom.\n\nKuwait had been loosely under the authority of the Ottoman vilâyet of Basra, and although its ruling dynasty, the Al Sabah family, had concluded a protectorate agreement in 1899 that assigned responsibility for its foreign affairs to Britain, it did not make any attempt to secede from the Ottoman Empire. For this reason, its borders with the rest of Basra province were never clearly defined or mutually agreed.\n\nOn 25 July 1990, April Glaspie, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, asked the Iraqi high command to explain the military preparations in progress, including the massing of Iraqi troops near the border.\n\nThe American ambassador declared to her Iraqi interlocutor that Washington, \"inspired by the friendship and not by confrontation, does not have an opinion\" on the disagreement between Kuwait and Iraq, stating \"we have no opinion on the Arab–Arab conflicts\".\nGlaspie also indicated to Saddam Hussein that the United States did not intend \"to start an economic war against Iraq\". These statements may have caused Saddam to believe he had received a diplomatic green light from the United States to invade Kuwait. This exchange only became public knowledge in 2011, following a WikiLeaks release of a cable, sent by the US embassy in Iraq, following on from Ms Glaspie's meeting with Saddam Hussein. In addition, one week before the invasion, the Assistant Secretary of State, John Kelly, told the US congress that the US had no treaty obligations to defend Kuwait.\n\nAccording to Richard E. Rubenstein, Glaspie was later asked by British journalists why she had said that, her response was \"we didn't think he would go that far\" meaning invade and annex the whole country. Although no follow-up question was asked, it can be inferred that what the U.S. government thought in July 1990 was that Saddam Hussein was only interested in pressuring Kuwait into debt forgiveness and to lower oil production.\n\nOn 2 August 1990 at 2:00 am, local time, by Saddam Husain’s order Iraq launched an invasion of Kuwait with four elite Iraqi Republican Guard divisions (1st Hammurabi Armoured Division, 2nd al-Medinah al-Munawera Armoured Division, 3rd Tawakalna ala-Allah Mechanized Infantry Division and 4th Nebuchadnezzar Motorized Infantry Division) and Iraqi Army special forces units equivalent to a full division. The main thrust was conducted by the commandos deployed by helicopters and boats to attack Kuwait City (see Battle of Dasman Palace), while the other divisions seized the airports and two airbases.\n\nIn support of these units, the Iraqi Army deployed a squadron of Mil Mi-25 helicopter gunships, several units of Mi-8 and Mi-17 transport helicopters, as well as a squadron of Bell 412 helicopters. The foremost mission of the helicopter units was to transport and support Iraqi commandos into Kuwait City, and subsequently to support the advance of ground troops. The Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) had at least two squadrons of Sukhoi Su-22, one of Su-25, one of Mirage F1 and two of MiG-23 fighter-bombers. The main task of the IQAF was to establish air superiority through limited air strikes against two main air bases of the Kuwaiti Air Force, whose aircraft consisted mainly of Mirage F1s and Douglas (T)A-4KU Skyhawks. Meanwhile, certain targets in the capital of Kuwait City were bombed by Iraqi aircraft.\n\nDespite months of Iraqi sabre-rattling, Kuwait did not have its forces on alert and was caught unaware. The first indication of the Iraqi ground advance was from a radar-equipped aerostat that detected an Iraqi armour column moving south. Kuwaiti air, ground, and naval forces resisted, but were vastly outnumbered. In central Kuwait, the 35th Armoured Brigade deployed approximately a battalion of Chieftain tanks, BMPs, and an artillery battery against the Iraqis and fought delaying actions near Al Jahra (see Battle of the Bridges), west of Kuwait City. In the south, the 15th Armoured Brigade moved immediately to evacuate its forces to Saudi Arabia. Of the small Kuwaiti Navy, two missile boats were able to evade capture or destruction.\n\nKuwait Air Force aircraft were scrambled, but approximately 20% were lost or captured. An air battle with the Iraqi helicopter airborne forces was fought over Kuwait City, inflicting heavy losses on the Iraqi elite troops , and a few combat sorties were flown against Iraqi ground forces. The remaining 80% were then evacuated to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, some aircraft even taking off from the highways adjacent to the bases as the runways were overrun. While these aircraft were not used in support of the subsequent Gulf War, the \"Free Kuwait Air Force\" assisted Saudi Arabia in patrolling the southern border with Yemen, which was considered a threat by the Saudi Arabians because of Yemen–Iraq ties.\nIraqi troops attacked Dasman Palace, the Royal Residence, resulting in the Battle of Dasman Palace. The Kuwaiti Emiri Guard, supported by local police and Chieftain tanks and a Platoon of Saladin armoured cars managed to repel an airborne assault by Iraqi special forces, but the Palace fell after a landing by Iraqi marines (Dasman Palace is located on the coast). The Kuwaiti National Guard, as well as additional Emiri Guards arrived, but the palace remained occupied, and Republican Guard tanks rolled into Kuwait City after several hours of heavy fighting.\n\nThe Emir of Kuwait, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah had already fled into the Saudi Arabian desert. His younger half brother, Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, was shot and killed by invading Iraqi forces as he attempted to defend Dasman Palace after which his body was placed in front of a tank and run over, according to an Iraqi soldier who was present and deserted after the assault.\n\nTowards the end of the first day of the invasion, only pockets of resistance were left in the country. By 3 August, the last military units were desperately fighting delaying actions at choke points and other defensible positions throughout the country until out of ammunition or overrun by Iraqi forces. Ali al-Salem Air Base of the Kuwaiti Air Force was the only base still unoccupied on 3 August, and Kuwaiti aircraft flew resupply missions from Saudi Arabia throughout the day in an effort to mount a defense. However, by nightfall, Ali al-Salem Air Base had been overrun by Iraqi forces. From then on it was only a matter of time until all units of the Kuwaiti Military were forced to retreat or be overrun.\n\nKuwaitis founded a local armed resistance movement following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. Most of the Kuwaitis who were arrested, tortured, and executed during the occupation were civilians. The Kuwaiti resistance's casualty rate far exceeded that of the coalition military forces and Western hostages. The resistance predominantly consisted of ordinary citizens who lacked any form of training and supervision.\n\nAt first, Iraqi forces did not use violent tactics. Iraqi soldiers instructed Kuwaitis to replace their Kuwaiti license plates with Iraqi ones, and also set up an extensive system of security checkpoints to patrol the Kuwaiti population. Within a few weeks of the invasion, however, Kuwaitis began participating in mass actions of nonviolent resistance. People stayed home from work and school en masse. Kuwaitis also began printing informational pamphlets about the invasion from their home computers and printers and distributed the pamphlets to neighbors and friends. After that wave of nonviolent resistance, the Iraqi military turned to repression in order to maintain control over Kuwait.\n\n400,000 Kuwaiti citizens left the country after the invasion, and a network of safe houses was established for those who remained and joined the resistance. Pamphlets with anti-war slogans were printed and the resistance provided hiding places and false identification cards for Kuwaitis who were sought by the Iraqi secret police. Resistance cells held secret meetings at mosques. Kuwaiti women like Asrar al-Qabandi, a prominent female resistance leader, staged street protests and carried signs with slogans like \"Free Kuwait: Stop the Atrocities Now.\" Iraqi police searched the homes of those suspected of hiding foreigners or covertly smuggling money to the resistance movement. Money that was smuggled to the resistance was often used to bribe Iraqi soldiers to look the other way. Resistance tactics included car bombs and sniper attacks that caused a considerable number of Iraqi casualties.\n\nBy August 1990, the resistance movement was receiving support from the U.S. government in the form of intelligence, materials, and other types of covert assistance. Both the CIA and the U.S. Green Berets were involved. The U.S. government, however, would neither confirm nor deny its support of the resistance on record. On the topic of the resistance, President Bush stated, \"... in a broad way I support the Kuwaiti underground. I support anybody that can add a hand in restoring legitimacy there to Kuwait and to getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait.\" Operation Desert Storm, which included U.S. forces, also aided the resistance movement out of its base in Taif, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Kuwaiti government went into exile in Taif and supported the resistance movement from there. The exiled Kuwaiti government explicitly supported the resistance and commented on its strategies. Although Iraqi forces curtailed almost all forms of communication within and outside the country, the resistance movement managed to smuggle satellite phones across the Saudi Arabian border in order to establish a line of communication with the exiled Kuwaiti government in Taif, Saudi Arabia. Kuwaitis also printed informational pamphlets and distributed them to other citizens. This was especially important because the flow of information was severely restricted in Kuwait during the occupation; radio channels played transmissions from Baghdad and many Kuwaiti TV channels were shut down. A resistance newspaper titled Sumoud al-Sha'ab (Steadfastness of the People) was printed and circulated in secret. Informational pamphlets became one of the only sources of news from the outside world. Foreigners and Kuwaitis of different genders and classes participated in the resistance, breaking down Kuwait’s traditional social barriers. Ahmed ar-Rahmi, a lieutenant colonel in the Kuwaiti army, stated, \"In Kuwait, everyone from children to old men resisted. There were no Kuwaiti puppets which Iraq could use to form a Government.\"\n\nIn October 1990, Iraqi officials cracked down on the resistance by executing hundreds of people it suspected were involved in the movement as well as conducting raids and searches of individual households. After the crackdown, the resistance began to target Iraqi military bases in order to reduce retaliation against Kuwaiti civilians. In October 1990, the Iraqi government opened the borders of Kuwait and allowed anyone to exit. This resulted in an exodus of both Kuwaitis and foreigners, which weakened the resistance movement.\n\nAnother crackdown occurred in January and February 1991. Iraqi forces publicly executed suspected members of the Kuwaiti resistance. Kuwaitis were kidnapped, their corpses later deposited in front of their family homes. The bodies of executed Kuwaiti resistance members showed evidence of different kinds of torture, including beating, electrical shocking, and fingernail removal. Some 5,000 Palestinians living in Kuwait were arrested for their activities in support of the resistance, and Palestinian support was enough to cause Iraqi officials to threaten Palestinian leaders. Some Palestinians, however, supported Saddam’s regime because of sympathies with the Ba’ath party’s pugnacious anti-Israel stance. Palestinian members of the resistance sometimes disagreed with resistance tactics such as the boycott of government offices and commercial activity. The Kuwaiti resistance movement was suspicious of this Palestinian ambivalence, and in the weeks after Iraqi forces withdrew, the Kuwaiti government cracked down on Palestinians suspected of sympathizing with the Saddam regime.\n\nIraqi forces also arrested over two thousand Kuwaitis suspected of helping the resistance and imprisoned them in Iraq. Many of those arrests were made during the Iraqi retreat from Kuwait in February 1991. Hundreds escaped from prisons in southern Iraq after the retreat and over one thousand were repatriated by the Iraqi government, but hundreds remain missing. The fate of 605 Kuwaitis arrested during the occupation remained unknown until 2009, when the remains of 236 of them were identified. Initially, Iraq claimed it had recorded the arrests of only 126 of the 605 missing Kuwaitis. The names of 369 other missing Kuwaitis are stored in files maintained by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Seven of those missing Kuwaitis are women and nearly 24 are under the age of 16. Iraq has made little effort to address the hundreds of missing Kuwaitis, despite trying to mend diplomatic relations with Kuwait in other ways.\n\nThe resistance was a grass roots movement and leadership was organized horizontally, although Sheik Salem Sabah was cited as the \"nominal head of the resistance movement.\"\n\nYahya F. Al-Sumait, Kuwait’s housing minister, said in October 1990 that the resistance movement helped undermine the occupation’s legitimacy and dispel the idea that Iraq invaded in order to assist with a popular uprising against the Kuwaiti government. The movement also protected Americans, British and other foreigners trapped in Kuwait during the occupation. Some have cited the resistance movement as part of the foundation for a more robust civil society in Kuwait after the occupation.\n\nAt the Al Qurain Martyrs Museum, Kuwait remembers its citizens slain during the resistance to Iraqi occupation. The families of those martyrs received material benefits from the Kuwaiti government such as cars, homes, and funding for trips to Mecca for the hajj. Since most accounts of the liberation of Kuwait focus on U.S.-led coalition forces, part of Kuwait’s goal in memorializing the resistance is to emphasize Kuwaiti citizens’ role in liberating their own country.\n\nAfter the Iraqi victory, Saddam Hussein installed Alaa Hussein Ali as the Prime Minister of the \"Provisional Government of Free Kuwait\" and Ali Hassan al-Majid as the de facto governor of Kuwait. The exiled Kuwaiti royal family and other former government officials began an international campaign to persuade other countries to pressure Iraq to vacate Kuwait. The UN Security Council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, but to no avail.\n\nFollowing the events of the Iraq–Kuwait war, about half of the Kuwaiti population, including 400,000 Kuwaitis and several thousand foreign nationals, fled the country. The Indian government evacuated over 170,000 overseas Indians by flying almost 488 flights over 59 days.\n\nDuring the 7-month occupation, the forces of Saddam Hussein looted Kuwait's vast wealth and there were also reports of violations of human rights. A 2005 study revealed that the Iraqi occupation had a long-term adverse impact on the health of the Kuwaiti populace.\n\nAfter Iraqi forces invaded and annexed Kuwait and Saddam Hussein deposed the Emir of Kuwait, Jaber Al-Sabah, he installed Ali Hassan al-Majid as the new governor of Kuwait.\n\nThe Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait was unanimously condemned by all major world powers. Even countries traditionally considered to be close Iraqi allies, such as France and India, called for immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Several countries, including the Soviet Union and China, placed arms embargoes on Iraq. NATO members were particularly critical of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and by late 1990, the United States had issued an ultimatum to Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait by 15 January 1991 or face war.\n\nOn 3 August 1990, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 660 condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and demanding that Iraq unconditionally withdraw all forces deployed in Kuwait.\n\nAfter a series of failed negotiations between major world powers and Iraq, the United States-led coalition forces launched a massive military assault on Iraq and Iraqi forces stationed in Kuwait in mid-January 1991. By 16 January, Allied aircraft were targeting several Iraqi military sites and the Iraqi Air Force was destroyed. Hostilities continued until late February and on 25 February, Kuwait was officially liberated from Iraq. On 15 March 1991, the Emir of Kuwait returned to the country after spending more than 8 months in exile. During the Iraqi occupation, about 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed and more than 300,000 residents fled the country.\n\nIn December 2002, Saddam Hussein apologized for the invasion shortly before being deposed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Two years later, the Palestinian leadership also apologized for its wartime support of Saddam. In 1990, Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, a longtime ally of Saddam Hussein, backed Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. After Iraq lost the Gulf War, Yemenis were deported en masse from Kuwait by the restored government.\n\nThe US military continue a strong presence adding 4,000 troops in February 2015 alone.\nThere is also a very strong US civilian presence with an estimated 18,000 American children in Kuwait being taught by 625 US teachers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2035578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035578", "title": "Bronze Age of Comic Books", "text": "Bronze Age of Comic Books\n\nThe Bronze Age of Comic Books is an informal name for a period in the history of American superhero comic books usually said to run from 1970 to 1984. It follows the Silver Age of Comic Books, and is followed by the Modern Age of Comic Books.\n\nThe Bronze Age retained many of the conventions of the Silver Age, with traditional superhero titles remaining the mainstay of the industry. However, a return of darker plot elements and storylines more related to relevant social issues, such as racism, began to flourish during the period, prefiguring the later Modern Age of Comic Books.\n\nThere is no one single event that can be said to herald the beginning of the Bronze Age. Instead, a number of events at the beginning of the 1970s, taken together, can be seen as a shift away from the tone of comics in the previous decade.\n\nOne such event was the April 1970 issue of Green Lantern, which added Green Arrow as a title character. The series, written by Denny O'Neil and penciled by Neal Adams (inking was by Adams or Dick Giordano), focused on \"relevance\" as Green Lantern was exposed to poverty and experienced self-doubt.\n\nLater in 1970, Jack Kirby left Marvel Comics, ending arguably the most important creative partnership of the Silver Age (with Stan Lee). Kirby then turned to DC, where he created \"The Fourth World\" series of titles starting with \"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #133\" in December 1970. Also in 1970 Mort Weisinger, the long term editor of the various Superman titles, retired to be replaced by Julius Schwartz. Schwartz set about toning down some of the more fanciful aspects of the Weisinger era, removing most Kryptonite from continuity and scaling back Superman's nigh-infinite—by then—powers, which was done by veteran Superman artist Curt Swan together with groundbreaking author Denny O'Neil.\n\nThe beginning of the Bronze Age coincided with the end of the careers of many of the veteran writers and artists of the time, or their promotion to management positions and retirement from regular writing or drawing, and their replacement with a younger generation of editors and creators, many of whom knew each other from their experiences in comic book fan conventions and publications. At the same time, publishers began the era by scaling back on their super-hero publications, canceling many of the weaker-selling titles, and experimenting with other genres such as horror and sword-and-sorcery.\n\nThe era also encompassed major changes in the distribution of and audience for comic books. Over time, the medium shifted from cheap mass market products sold at newsstands to a more expensive product sold at specialty comic book shops and aimed at a smaller, core audience of fans. The shift in distribution allowed many small-print publishers to enter the market, changing the medium from one dominated by a few large publishers to a more diverse and eclectic range of books.\n\nIn 1970, Marvel published the first comic book issue of Robert E. Howard's pulp character Conan the Barbarian. Conan's success as a comic hero resulted in adaptations of other Howard characters: King Kull, Red Sonja, and Solomon Kane. DC Comics responded with comics featuring Warlord, Beowulf, and Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. They also took over the licensing of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Tarzan from long-time publisher Gold Key and began adapting other Burroughs creations, such as John Carter, the Pellucidar series, and the Amtor series. Marvel also adapted to comic book form, with less success, Edwin Lester Arnold's character and, later, Lin Carter's Thongor.\n\nThe murder of Spider-Man's longtime girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, at the hands of the Green Goblin in 1973's \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #121-122 is considered by comics scholar Arnold T. Blumberg to be the definitive Bronze Age event, as it exemplifies the period's trend towards darker territory and willingness to subvert conventions such as the assumed survival of long-established, \"untouchable\" characters. However, there had been a gradual darkening of the tone of superhero comics for several years prior to \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\", including the death of her father in 1970's \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #90 and the beginning of the Dennis O'Neil/Neal Adams tenure on \"Batman\".\n\nIn 1971, Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Stan Lee was approached by the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to do a comic book story about drug abuse. Lee agreed and wrote a three-part Spider-Man story, \"Green Goblin Reborn!,\" which portrayed drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. At that time, any portrayal of drug use in comic books was banned outright by the Comics Code Authority, regardless of the context. The CCA refused to approve the story, but Lee published it regardless.\n\nThe positive reception that the story received led to the CCA revising the Comics Code later that year to allow the portrayal of drug addiction as long as it was depicted in a negative light. Soon after, DC Comics had their own drug abuse storyline in \"Green Lantern/Green Arrow\" #85-86. Written by Denny O'Neil with art by Neal Adams, the storyline was entitled \"Snowbirds Don't Fly,\" and it revealed that the Green Arrow's sidekick Speedy had become addicted to heroin.\n\nThe 1971 revision to the Comics Code has also been seen as relaxing the rules on the use of vampires, ghouls and werewolves in comic books, allowing the growth of a number of supernatural and horror-oriented titles, such as \"Swamp Thing\", \"Ghost Rider\" and \"The Tomb of Dracula\", among numerous others. However, the tone of horror comic stories had already seen substantial changes between the relatively tame offerings of the early 1960s (e.g. \"Unusual Tales\") and the more violent products available in the late 1960s (e.g. \"The Witching Hour\", revised formats in \"House of Secrets\", \"House of Mystery\", \"The Unexpected\").\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, publishers moved away from the super-hero stories that enjoyed mass-market popularity in the mid-1960s; DC cancelled most of its super-hero titles other than those starring Superman and Batman, while Marvel cancelled weaker-selling titles such as \"Dr. Strange\", \"Sub-Mariner\" and \"The X-Men\". In their place, they experimented with a wide variety of other genres, including Westerns, horror and monster stories, and the above-mentioned adaptations of pulp adventures. These trends peaked in the early 1970s, and the medium reverted by the mid-1970s to selling predominantly super-hero titles.\n\nA concern with social issues had been a part of comic book stories since their beginnings: early Superman stories, for example, dealt with issues such as child mistreatment and working conditions for minors. However, in the 1970s relevance became not only a feature of the stories, but also something that the books loudly proclaimed on their covers to promote sales. The Spider-Man drug issues were at the forefront of the trend of \"social relevance\" with comic books noticeably handling real-life issues. The above-mentioned \"Green Lantern/Green Arrow\" series dealt not only with drugs, but other topics like racism and environmental degradation. The X-Men titles, which were partly based on the premise that mutants were a metaphor for real-world minorities, became wildly popular. Other well-known \"relevant\" comics include the \"Demon in a Bottle\", where Iron Man confronts his alcoholism, and the socially conscious stories written by Steve Gerber in such titles as \"Howard the Duck\" and \"Omega the Unknown\". Issues regarding female empowerment became trends with female versions of popular male characters (Spider-Woman, Red Sonja, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk).\n\nWriters and artists began getting a lot more credit for their creations even though they were still ceding copyrights to the companies for whom they worked. Pencil Artists were allowed to keep their original artwork and sell it on the open market. When word got out that Superman's creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were living in poverty, artists such as Neal Adams, Jerry Robinson, and Bernie Wrightson helped organize fellow artists to pressure DC in rectifying them and other pioneers from the 1930s and 1940s. Newer publishers, such as Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics, negotiated contracts in which creators retained copyright to their creations.\n\nOne of the most significant developments during the period was a substantial rise in the number of black and other non-white minority superheroes. Before the 1970s, there had been very few non-white superheroes (Black Panther and Falcon of the Avengers being notable exceptions) but starting in the early 1970s this began to change with the introduction of characters such as Marvel's Luke Cage (who was the first black superhero to star in his own comic book in 1972) of the Defenders, Storm of the X-Men, Blade, Monica Rambeau of the Avengers, Misty Knight, Shang-Chi, and DC's Green Lantern John Stewart, Bronze Tiger, Black Lightning, Vixen, and Cyborg of Teen Titans many of whom were black (with the exception of Shang-Chi himself). Additionally, Jewish superheroes became more visible with the appearances of Marvel's Kitty Pryde of the X-Men and Moon Knight respectively.\n\nCharacters such as Luke Cage, Mantis, Misty Knight, Shang-Chi, and Iron Fist have been seen by some as an attempt by Marvel Comics to cash in on the 1970s crazes for Kung Fu movies. However, these and other minority characters came into their own after these film trends faded, and became increasingly popular and important as time progressed. By the mid-1980s, Storm and Cyborg had become leaders of the X-Men and Teen Titans respectively, and John Stewart briefly replaced Hal Jordan as the lead character of the \"Green Lantern\" title.\n\nStarting with Neal Adams' work in \"Green Lantern/Green Arrow\" a newly sophisticated realism became the norm in the industry. Buyers would no longer be interested in the heavily stylized work of artists of the Silver Age or simpler cartooning of the Golden Age. The so-called \"House Styles\" of DC and Marvel became imitations of Adams' work and much more realistic versions of Kirby's respectively. This change is sometimes credited to a new generation of artists influenced by the popularity of EC Comics in the 1950s. In spite of the House Styles, those artists who could draw apart from these would gain some notoriety. Such names include Berni Wrightson, Jim Aparo, Jim Starlin, John Byrne, Frank Miller, George Pérez, and Howard Chaykin. A secondary line of comics at DC, headed by former EC Comics artist Joe Orlando and devoted to horror titles, established a differing set of styles and aggressively sought talent from Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe X-Men were originally created in 1963 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. However, the title never achieved the popularity of other Lee/Kirby creations, and by 1970 Marvel ceased publishing new material and the title was turned over to reprints. But in 1975 an \"all-new all-different\" version of the X-Men was introduced by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum in \"Giant-Size X-Men\" #1, with Chris Claremont as uncredited assistant co-plotter. Claremont stayed as writer on just about all X-Men related titles, including spinoffs, for the next sixteen years, after which other regular writers such as Louise Simonson, Fabian Nicieza, and Scott Lobdell joined and Claremont eventually left.\n\nOne of the most apparent influences from this series was the creation of what became DC Comics' answer to X-Men's character-based storytelling style, \"The New Teen Titans\" by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, which became a highly successful and influential property in its own right. Wolfman would associate himself with the title for sixteen years, while Perez established a large fan base and sought-after pencilling style. A successful cartoon based on the Titans of the Bronze Age of Comics was launched in 2003, and lasted for four years.\n\nDuring the Silver Age, comic books frequently had several features, a form harkening back to the Golden Age when the first comics were anthologies. In 1968, Marvel graduated its double feature characters appearing in their anthologies to full-length stories in their own comic. But several of these characters could not sustain their own title and were cancelled. Marvel tried to create new double feature anthologies such as \"Amazing Adventures\" and \"Astonishing Tales\" which did not last as double feature comic books. A more enduring concept was that of the team-up book, either combining two characters, at least one of which was not popular enough to sustain its own title (\"Green Lantern/Green Arrow\"). Even DC combined two features in \"Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" and had team-up books (\"The Brave and the Bold\", \"DC Comics Presents\" and \"World's Finest Comics\"). Virtually all such books disappeared by the end of the period.\n\nMarvel and DC worked out several crossover titles the first of which was \"Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-Man\". This was followed by a second Superman and Spider-Man, \"Batman vs. the Incredible Hulk\" and the \"X-Men vs The New Teen Titans\". Another title, \"The Avengers vs. the Justice League of America\" was written by Gerry Conway and drawn by George Pérez with plotting by Roy Thomas, but was never published, reflecting the later animosity between the two companies. Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter was not pleased that DC wanted the fourth company crossover to include the New Teen Titans, DC's best-selling title at the time, as he wanted the crossover to be the X-Men and the Legion of Super-Heroes. This led to Shooter's decision to stall and cancel the JLA/Avengers project.\n\nBeginning circa 1970, Marvel introduced vast numbers of reprints into the market, which played a key role in their becoming the overall market leader among comic publishers. Suddenly many titles featured reprints: \"X-Men\", \"Sgt. Fury\", \"Kid Colt Outlaw\", \"Rawhide Kid\", \"Two-Gun Kid\", \"Outlaw Kid\", \"Jungle Action\", \"Special Marvel Edition\" (the early issues), \"War is Hell\" (the early issues), \"Creatures on the Loose\", \"Monsters on the Prowl\", and \"FEAR\", to name just a few.\n\nIn the mid-'70s, DC launched numerous new titles such as Jack Kirby's \"New Gods\" and Steve Ditko's \"Shade the Changing Man\". Jenette Kahn would eventually take the helm of the company in 1976. The company followed this up in 1978 with the \"DC Explosion\" where the standard line of books increased in page count and 50 cent price. Many of these titles added backup features with various characters. However, DC greatly overestimated the appeal of so many new titles at once, sales dropped severely during the harsh 1978 winter and it nearly broke the company and the industry, including Charlton Comics; this event has been called the \"DC Implosion\".\n\nMarvel eventually gained 50% of the market and Stan Lee handed control of the comic division to Jim Shooter while he worked with their growing animation spin-offs.\n\nAs the Bronze Age began in the early 1970s, popularity shifted away from the established superhero genre towards comic book titles from which superheroes were absent altogether. These non-superhero comics were typically inspired by genres like Westerns or fantasy & pulp fiction. As previously noted, 1971's revised Comics Code left the horror genre ripe for development and several supernaturally-themed series resulted, such as the popular \"The Tomb of Dracula\", \"Ghost Rider\" and \"Swamp Thing\". In the science fiction genre, post-apocalyptic survival stories were an early trend, as evidenced by characters like \"Deathlok\", \"Killraven\", and \"Kamandi\". The long-running sci-fi/fantasy anthology comic magazine \"Metal Hurlant\" and its American counterpart \"Heavy Metal\" began publishing in the late '70s. Marvel's \"Star Wars\" series was very popular with a nine-year run.\n\nOther titles began from characters originally found in 20th century pulp magazines or novels. Noteworthy examples are the long running titles \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"Savage Sword of Conan\" (the latter was published as a magazine, bypassing the Comics Code), as well as \"Master of Kung-Fu\". The early success of these titles soon led to more pulp character adaptations (\"Doc Savage\", \"Kull\", \"The Shadow\", \"Justice, Inc.\", \"Tarzan\"). During this period, both Marvel and DC also regularly published official comic book adaptations for various projects, including popular movies (\"Planet of the Apes\", \"Godzilla\", \"Logan's Run\", \"Indiana Jones\", \"Jaws 2\", \"\", \"Star Wars\"), TV shows (\"The Man from Atlantis\", \"Battlestar Galactica\", \"Star Trek\", \"The A-Team\", \"Welcome Back Kotter\"), toys (\"\", \"Micronauts\", \"Transformers\", \"Rom\", \"Atari Force\", \"Thundercats\"), and even public figures (Kiss, Pope John Paul II).\n\nThough not necessarily \"non-superhero\", a few unconventional comic book series from the period featured one or more villains as their central character (\"Super-Villain Team-Up\", \"Secret Society of Super-Villains\", \"The Joker\").\n\nArchie Comics dominated the female market during this time with their characters, Betty and Veronica having some of the largest circulation of titular female characters. Several clones were attempted by Marvel and DC unsuccessfully. Several Archie titles examined socially relevant issues and introduced a few African-American characters. Archie largely switched to paperback digest format in the late 1980s.\n\nChildren's comics were still popular with Disney reprints under the Gold Key label along with Harvey's stable of characters which grew in popularity. The latter included \"Richie Rich\", \"Casper\", and \"Wendy\", which eventually switched to digest format as well. Again Marvel and DC were unable to emulate their success with competing titles.\n\nAn 'explicit content' market akin to the niche Underground Comix of the late '60s was ostensibly opened with the Franco-Belgian import \"Heavy Metal Magazine\". Marvel launched competing magazine titles of their own with \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"Epic Illustrated\" which would eventually become its division of Direct Sales comics.\n\nThe paper drives of World War II and a growing nostalgia among Baby-Boomers in the 1970s made comic books of the 1930s and 1940s extremely valuable. DC experimented with some large size paperback books to reprint their Golden Age comics, create one-shot stories such as \"Superman vs. Shazam\" and \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" as well as the early Marvel crossovers.\n\nThe popularity of those early books also opened up a market for specialty shops. The existence of these shops made it possible for small-press publishers to reach an audience, and some comic book artists began self-publishing their own work. Notable titles of this type included Dave Sim's \"Cerebus\" and Wendy and Richard Pini's \"Elfquest\" series. Other small-press publishers came in to take advantage of this growing market: Pacific Comics introduced in 1981 a line of books by comic-book veterans such as Jack Kirby, Mike Grell and Sergio Aragonés, for which the artists retained copyright and shared in royalties.\n\nIn 1978, Will Eisner published his \"graphic novel\" \"A Contract With God\", an attempt to produce a long-format story outside the traditional comic book genres. In the early 1980s Art Spiegelman and Françoise Mouly began publishing \"Raw Magazine\", which included the early serialization of Spiegelman's award-winning graphic novel \"Maus\".\n\nComics sold on newsstands were distributed on the basis that unsold copies were returned to the publisher. Comics sold to comic shops were sold on a no-return basis. This allowed small-press titles sold through the direct market to keep publishing costs down and increase profits, making viable titles that otherwise would have been unprofitable. Marvel and DC began taking advantage of this direct market themselves, publishing books and titles distributed only through comic book shops.\n\nThis period is also marked by the cancellation of most titles in the genres of romance, western and war stories that had been a mainstay of comics production since the forties. Most anthologies, whether they presented feature characters or not, also disappeared. They had been used since the Golden Age to create new characters, to host characters that lost their own title or to feature several characters. This had the effect of standardizing the length of comics stories within a narrow range so that multiple stand-alone stories would appear within a single issue. The underground comix of the 1960s counterculture continued, but contracted significantly and were ultimately subsumed into the emerging direct market.\n\nOne commonly used ending point for the Bronze Age is the 1985–1986 time frame. As with the Silver Age, the end of the Bronze Age relates to a number of trends and events that happened at around the same time. At this point, DC Comics completed its special event, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" which marked the revitalization of the company's product line to become a serious market contender against Marvel, as happened before. This time frame also includes the company's release of the highly acclaimed works, \"Watchmen\" by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, and \"\" by Frank Miller, which redefined the superhero genre and inspired years of \"grim and gritty\" comic books.\n\nAt Marvel Comics, the commonly used milestone marking the end of the Bronze Age is \"Secret Wars\", although this could be extended to 1986 which saw the cancellation of \"Defenders\" and \"Power Man and Iron Fist\", as well as the launch of the New Universe and \"X-Factor\" (extension of the X-Men franchise).\n\nAfter the Bronze Age came the Modern Age of Comic Books, alternatively referred to as the Dark Age of Comic Books. According to Shawn O'Rourke of PopMatters, the shift from the previous ages involved a \"deconstructive and dystopian re-envisioning of iconic characters and the worlds that they live in\", as typified by Frank Miller's \"\" (1986) and Alan Moore's and Dave Gibbons' \"Watchmen\" (1986–1987). Other features that define the era are an increase in adult oriented content, the rise of the X-Men as Marvel Comics' \"dominant intellectual property\", and a reorganization of the industry's distribution system.\nThese changes would also lead to the appearance of new independent comic book publishers in the early 1990s - such as Image Comics, with titles like \"Spawn\" and \"Savage Dragon\" which also boasted a darker, sarcastic and more mature approach to superhero storylines.\n\nWriters\n\nArtists\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2035588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035588", "title": "Radiochemistry", "text": "Radiochemistry\n\nRadiochemistry is the chemistry of radioactive materials, where radioactive isotopes of elements are used to study the properties and chemical reactions of non-radioactive isotopes (often within radiochemistry the absence of radioactivity leads to a substance being described as being \"inactive\" as the isotopes are \"stable\"). Much of radiochemistry deals with the use of radioactivity to study ordinary chemical reactions. This is very different from radiation chemistry where the radiation levels are kept too low to influence the chemistry.\n\nRadiochemistry includes the study of both natural and man-made radioisotopes.\n\nAll radioisotopes are unstable isotopes of elements—undergo nuclear decay and emit some form of radiation. The radiation emitted can be of several types including alpha, beta, gamma radiation, proton and neutron emission along with neutrino and antiparticle emission decay pathways.\n\n1. α (alpha) radiation—the emission of an alpha particle (which contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons) from an atomic nucleus. When this occurs, the atom's atomic mass will decrease by 4 units and atomic number will decrease by 2.\n\n2. β (beta) radiation—the transmutation of a neutron into an electron and a proton. After this happens, the electron is emitted from the nucleus into the electron cloud.\n\n3. γ (gamma) radiation—the emission of electromagnetic energy (such as gamma rays) from the nucleus of an atom. This usually occurs during alpha or beta radioactive decay.\n\nThese three types of radiation can be distinguished by their difference in penetrating power.\n\nAlpha can be stopped quite easily by a few centimetres in air or a piece of paper and is equivalent to a helium nucleus. Beta can be cut off by an aluminium sheet just a few millimetres thick and are electrons. Gamma is the most penetrating of the three and is a massless chargeless high energy photon. Gamma radiation requires an appreciable amount of heavy metal radiation shielding (usually lead or barium-based) to reduce its intensity.\n\nBy neutron irradiation of objects it is possible to induce radioactivity; this activation of stable isotopes to create radioisotopes is the basis of neutron activation analysis. One of the most interesting objects which has been studied in this way is the hair of Napoleon's head, which have been examined for their arsenic content.\n\nA series of different experimental methods exist, these have been designed to enable the measurement of a range of different elements in different matrices. To reduce the effect of the matrix it is common to use the chemical extraction of the wanted element \"and/or\" to allow the radioactivity due to the matrix elements to decay before the measurement of the radioactivity. Since the matrix effect can be corrected for by observing the decay spectrum, little or no sample preparation is required for some samples, making neutron activation analysis less susceptible to contamination.\n\nThe effects of a series of different cooling times can be seen if a hypothetical sample which contains sodium, uranium and cobalt in a 100:10:1 ratio was subjected to a very short pulse of thermal neutrons. The initial radioactivity would be dominated by the Na activity (half-life 15 h) but with increasing time the Np (half-life 2.4 d after formation from parent U with half-life 24 min) and finally the Co activity (5.3 yr) would predominate.\n\nOne biological application is the study of DNA using radioactive phosphorus-32. In these experiments stable phosphorus is replaced by the chemically identical radioactive P-32, and the resulting radioactivity is used in analysis of the molecules and their behaviour.\n\nAnother example is the work which was done on the methylation of elements such as sulfur, selenium, tellurium and polonium by living organisms. It has been shown that bacteria can convert these elements into volatile compounds, it is thought that methylcobalamin (vitamin B) alkylates these elements to create the dimethyls. It has been shown that a combination of Cobaloxime and inorganic polonium in sterile water forms a volatile polonium compound, while a control experiment which did not contain the cobalt compound did not form the volatile polonium compound. For the sulfur work the isotope S was used, while for polonium Po was used. In some related work by the addition of Co to the bacterial culture, followed by isolation of the cobalamin from the bacteria (and the measurement of the radioactivity of the isolated cobalamin) it was shown that the bacteria convert available cobalt into methylcobalamin.\n\nIn medicine PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans are commonly used in diagnostic purposes in. A radiative tracer is injected intravenously into the patient and then taken to the PET machine. The radioactive tracer releases radiation outward from the patient and the cameras in the machine interpret the radiation rays from the tracer. PET scan machines use solid state scintillation detection because of its high detection efficiency, NaI(Tl) crystals absorb the tracers radiation and produce photons that get converted into an electrical signal for the machine to analyze. \n\nRadiochemistry also includes the study of the behaviour of radioisotopes in the environment; for instance, a forest or grass fire can make radioisotopes become mobile again. In these experiments, fires were started in the exclusion zone around Chernobyl and the radioactivity in the air downwind was measured.\n\nIt is important to note that a vast number of processes are able to release radioactivity into the environment, for example the action of cosmic rays on the air is responsible for the formation of radioisotopes (such as C and P), the decay of Ra forms Rn which is a gas which can diffuse through rocks before entering buildings and dissolve in water and thus enter drinking water In addition, human activities such as bomb tests, accidents, and normal releases from industry have resulted in the release of radioactivity.\n\nThe environmental chemistry of some radioactive elements such as plutonium is complicated by the fact that solutions of this element can undergo disproportionation and as a result many different oxidation states can coexist at once. Some work has been done on the identification of the oxidation state and coordination number of plutonium and the other actinides under different conditions. This includes work on both solutions of relatively simple complexes and work on colloids Two of the key matrixes are soil/rocks and concrete, in these systems the chemical properties of plutonium have been studied using methods such as EXAFS and XANES.\n\nWhile binding of a metal to the surfaces of the soil particles can prevent its movement through a layer of soil, it is possible for the particles of soil which bear the radioactive metal can migrate as colloidal particles through soil. This has been shown to occur using soil particles labeled with Cs, these have been shown to be able to move through cracks in the soil.\n\nRadioactivity is present everywhere (and has been since the formation of the earth). According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, one kilogram of soil typically contains the following amounts of the following three natural radioisotopes 370 Bq K (typical range 100–700 Bq), 25 Bq Ra (typical range 10–50 Bq), 25 Bq U (typical range 10–50 Bq) and 25 Bq Th (typical range 7–50 Bq).\n\nThe action of micro-organisms can fix uranium; Thermoanaerobacter can use chromium(VI), iron(III), cobalt(III), manganese(IV) and uranium(VI) as electron acceptors while acetate, glucose, hydrogen, lactate, pyruvate, succinate, and xylose can act as electron donors for the metabolism of the bacteria. In this way the metals can be reduced to form magnetite (FeO), siderite (FeCO), rhodochrosite (MnCO), and uraninite (UO). Other researchers have also worked on the fixing of uranium using bacteria , Francis R. Livens \"et al.\" (Working at Manchester) have suggested that the reason why \"Geobacter sulfurreducens\" can reduce cations to uranium dioxide is that the bacteria reduce the uranyl cations to which then undergoes disproportionation to form and UO. This reasoning was based (at least in part) on the observation that is not converted to an insoluble neptunium oxide by the bacteria.\n\nDespite the growing use of nuclear medicine, the potential expansion of nuclear power plants, and worries about protection against nuclear threats and the management of the nuclear waste generated in past decades, the number of students opting to specialize in nuclear and radiochemistry has decreased significantly over the past few decades. Now, with many experts in these fields approaching retirement age, action is needed to avoid a workforce gap in these critical fields, for example by building student interest in these careers, expanding the educational capacity of universities and colleges, and providing more specific on-the-job training.\n\nNuclear and Radiochemistry (NRC) is mostly being taught at university level, usually first at the Master- and PhD-degree level. In Europe, as substantial effort is being done to harmonize and prepare the NRC education for the industry's and society's future needs. This effort is being coordinated in a projects funded by the Coordinated Action supported by the European Atomic Energy Community's 7th Framework Program: The CINCH-II project - Cooperation in education and training In Nuclear Chemistry. This project has set up a wiki dedicated to NRC teaching: NucWik. Although NucWik is primarily aimed at teachers, anyone interested in Nuclear and Radiochemistry is welcome and can find a lot of information and material explaining topics related to NRC.\n\n"}

A point can consist of a double fault by the server, in which case it is won by the receiver; otherwise, it begins with a legal serve by one side's server to the receiver on the other, and continues until one side fails to make a legal return to the other, losing the point. Four points win a game, counted as 15 (1 point), 30 (2 points), 40 (3 points). A game must be won by at least two points.\n\nThe players (or teams) stand on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the \"server\", and the opposing player (or, in doubles, one of the opposing players) is the \"receiver\". The players (or teams) alternate serving from game to game. From point to point within a game, the server alternates between the right (forehand) and left (backhand) sides of his end of the court. At the start of each point, the server stands behind his baseline, between the center mark and one of the sidelines (the first serve of a game is made from the right hand side). The receiver may stand anywhere on his side of the net, usually behind the diagonally opposite service box, the target for the server's ball.\n\nA legal serve is any serve which does not \"fault\". A fault occurs if the ball is touched by anything other than the racket, between the time the server throws the ball into the air to serve it and the time at which it lands in the designated service box; service faults are also incurred for missing the ball, stepping across the baseline before striking the ball (foot fault), and walking or running while serving. Two consecutive faults (double fault) result in the opponent winning the point. The receiver must allow the serve to bounce once before returning it, or they lose the point.\n\nIf the ball touches the net on an otherwise legal serve (this is called a \"let\" or \"net service\") the serve is retaken, without being counted as a fault. (On any other return during the point, the ball may touch the net without any consequence.)\n\nIf a legal serve is made, the players then alternate returning the ball from their side of the court to the opponent's. The point is lost by whichever player first:\n\nThe rules \"allow\" such actions as:\n\nBecause the lines are drawn just inside the courts, the ball is considered \"in\" if it touches any part of the relevant line. On clay courts the ball leaves an impression in the ground that can be checked; on grass courts a puff of chalk from the line indicates contact from the ball. This is less accurate, however, because dirt from the grass court resembles the chalk and can also be thrown up after being struck with a ball.\n\nIn an unofficiated game, the players are to give each other the benefit of the doubt on line calls. In an officiated game it is the chair umpire or line umpire's duty to call the ball \"out.\" The chair umpire may overrule a line umpire's call.\n\nComputer-assisted video tracking technology has improved to the point that it can determine the position of a ball at impact with a margin of error less than five millimeters.\nAccordingly, starting with the NASDAQ-100 Open in March 2006, most top-level tournaments allow systems such as \"Hawk-Eye\" to be used to settle disputed line calls.\n\nPlayers are allowed to appeal to Hawk-Eye on disputed calls with a limitation: They lose the privilege if the appeal goes against them three times per set, with one more challenge allowed during a tie-breaker.\n\nIn the 2006 NASDAQ-100 Open, challenges by men were upheld 38% compared to 27% for women (skewed by Maria Sharapova, who went 0 for 11).\n\nAt the Championships, Wimbledon 2008, in the men's singles challenges were successful 29% of the time with an average of 6.6 challenges per match, in the women's singles challenges were successful 20% of the time with an average of 3.8 challenges per match.\n\nAs of 1999, in Division I tennis in the NCAA, a let service is considered playable. This rule change was made to prevent receivers from falsely claiming a valid service to be a let, which is a call that cannot be overruled. Thus, a service that hits the net before landing in the service box is a playable shot, and must be returned by the receiver. Otherwise, the receiver loses the point.\n\nDuring high school tennis team matches, players may have to follow a few different rules:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2035607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035607", "title": "Tabubil", "text": "Tabubil\n\nTabubil is a town, company operated township located in the Star Mountains area of the North Fly District of Western Province, Papua New Guinea. The town, including the adjoining relocated village of Wangabin and the industrial area of Laydown (where industrial equipment was originally laid down before being installed at the mine ~1970–1980), is the largest settlement in the province, although the provincial capital, Daru is a similar size. It had a recorded population of 10,270 at the 2011 census.\n\nTabubil is set in extremely dense jungle fed by one of the highest rainfalls in the world. The town is the largest settlement in the country that has never been a provincial capital, or incorporated within one. The town was established primarily to serve the mine of Ok Tedi, which is currently mining copper and gold.\n\nTabubil lies in the heart of the Min Nation, an area with a distinct ethnic makeup that straddles the Indonesian border, and extends towards the southern Sepik areas and throughout the northern Fly River system. During the early years of colonisation of New Guinea it was unknown how many people, if any, lived in this remote and seemingly impassable and inhospitable terrain.\n\nBefore the 1940s, outside contact with the Min people was either brief, or merely vicarious. It is thought the Min were pushed north hundreds or even thousands of years ago by war with the southern Gogodala peoples, who were a strong warrior nation that currently reside on the plains of the central Fly area of the Western Province.\n\nIt was not until 1943 that USAAF gliders landed deep in the Star Mountains to establish an airstrip station in what is now Telefomin, about 25 km north-east of Tabubil. This is the first permanent colonial influence on the Min people, who at the time were Cannibals involved in a deep tribal war. Soon after the arrival of the Americans, the Telefolmin tribe experienced a cessation of hostilities with its neighbours, the Falamin and the Tifalmin due to mutually agreeable conditions that emerged from the construction and introduction of western goods and services. Conflict between social groups was also forcefully deterred by Australian colonial administrators. After colonial pacification, trade flourished in the area.\n\nTabubil, originally a small camp surrounding an airstrip, was set up as a base of operations for drilling sites by the Kennecott Copper Corporation. In 1976, Australian mining company BHP entered into negotiations with the Papua New Guinea government in an attempt to gain control of the camp and establish it as a gold mining town. BHP was successful in 1980, and in 1981, Ok Tedi Mining Limited was established to take control of operations, with a major BHP shareholding.\n\nToday, the old Kennecott camp is still standing. Known locally as the \"A\" houses, they are ATCO shipping crate styled houses. Later, the \"B\" and \"C\" houses were built by BHP for their workers. BHP has built the majority of the town, with structures placed by other companies and the national government making up only a small percentage of the total buildings. \n\nTabubil is host to a diverse range of cultures, due to its workforce historically being sourced from many parts of PNG, Australia, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Most expatriates are Australian, but there are also many Filipinos. A Canadian mining company, Inmet Mining Corporation owns an 18% stake in the mine, and of Tabubil.  A number of Canadians, particularly those from Port Hardy on Vancouver Island, have also resided in Tabubil. During recent years, however, Ok Tedi Mining Limited has looked closer to home for human resources, with its long existent, but recently enforced \"preferred area\" human resourcing plan.\n\nThe main cultural event of the year is Papua New Guinea's Independence Day. The event is proceeded by a festival known as the \"Amamas Week\" meaning joyful week, encompassing a week of traditional and contemporary dancing(arranged and performed by school students, local groups and groups from other provinces), music, traditional ceremonies. In the 90s, performers from other countries like Samoa, New Zealand, were also invited to showcase their traditional dances for the week. \n\nElections are extremely important to local residents, often inciting riots, tribal conflict, and other forms of civil disobedience. The provincial government has banned the sale of alcohol during an election to try and curb violence. \n\nMelbourne Cup day has been a well celebrated event since the foundation of the town. As many expatriate residents of the town are from Australia, Melbourne Cup celebrations have been a traditionally important connection to the culture left behind in Australia. \n\nThe most popular religion in the town is Christianity. There are still a few people that hold traditional beliefs, and others that blend traditional beliefs with Christianity.\n\nTabubil is host to four major permanent churches, and many other church groups that meet in the large undercover areas beneath the \"B\" and \"C\" style houses.\n\nThe Mission Aviation Fellowship has a presence in Tabubil Airport and the YMCA and YWCA hold a strong influence over the town culture and commerce.\n\nAlthough many people in Tabubil own computers, internet use is very rare. There is, however, a wide selection of cable TV stations available from Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, PNG, and the USA. There is a local TV station called OTV. Several AM and FM radio stations are available in town. Radio Fly is on shortwave frequencies 3915 kHz and 5960 kHz.\n\nMobile (cellular) phone and data services are provided by Telikom PNG (CitiFon) and Digicel.\n\nTabubil has a tropical rainforest climate more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and with no cyclones therefore equatorial. The town is known unofficially as one of the wettest places on earth, with an average annual rainfall of 8 metres per annum, and a peak rainfall of 10 metres per annum. The unique weather conditions have caused much adaptation in the local jungle flora and fauna, causing Tabubil to be particularly interesting to the scientific community.\n\nTabubil often has a transient population that aren't used to the large amounts of rain that fall there. Locals, however, operate quite happily in the rain, as it rains daily, and residents cannot afford to let it disrupt their lives.\n\nMost fixed houses in northern Tabubil are designed to suit the town and its unique conditions much better than their counterparts in the south, as the 'B' and 'C' class houses are newer. Most of these newer houses have a large dry undercover area under the house, and are raised on stilts. Many people think the houses are on stilts due to the possibility of flooding, but they mostly provide protection from the many earthquakes in the area.\n\nThe entire town is slightly sloped on an increment towards the south. This provides excellent water runoff, which is aided by the many 'floodways' which are found around town, and allow large volumes of water to cross roads. Most residents, especially on the escarpment side of town, have large ravines in their backyards which can fill up to a depth of two metres during especially wet periods, and pose a safety hazard.\n\nBecause of the large rainfall, there are many indoor sporting facilities in town. Indoor facilities for sports such as squash, indoor cricket, gymnastics, basketball, and other sports are available.\n\nIn a country where biodiversity is extreme, the area around Tabubil is regarded as being especially unique. There are untold numbers of different species of birds, fish, insects, spiders, and small animals. The area around Tabubil is known for moths that grow to the size of dinner plates, bird eating spiders and many other unique creatures. New species are being discovered constantly.\n\nThe sheer abundance of life in the area is attributed to the high rainfall. In town, many plant species, such as mint, that grow elsewhere in the world can be found in large amounts. The plants in Tabubil are larger than usual, and grow much faster than they do elsewhere.\n\nTabubil is the base of operations for the Ok Tedi Copper Mine, the largest economic entity in the Western Province. The mine accounts for over half of the entire province's economy and 25.7% of the country's entire export earnings. Consequently, Tabubil is the richest and most well served settlement in western Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe mine, which operates as Ok Tedi Mining Limited was formerly owned by a joint initiative between the PNG government, and Australian mining giant, BHP. In 2002 the mine was restructured, and the PNG Sustainable Development Program now owns the BHP share.\n\nTabubil is serviced by a hotel, a hospital, a police station and courthouse, fire station, two primary schools (one international), a community high school, two supermarkets, a bakery, chemist, two banks, and a hardware store. Various other local businesses create an unusually westernised culture within this remote town.\n\nVarious clubs operate in the town, including the Golf Club, the Hash House Harriers, and the Gazebo club. For non drinking related recreation there is an indoor squash court, indoor cricket centre, tennis courts, a public pool, rugby fields, a gym, and many jungle tracks which may or may not be safe to walk along.\n\nThe main commercial hub of town is in the Centre, to the northeast of the airport. This commercial district is based around a town square plan, and was host to the first ATMs, EFTPOS machines and public telephones in western Papua New Guinea. The largest store in town, the Tabubil Superstore, is located in the Centre. There is also a smaller, newer supermarket in the north of town and several smaller convenience shops known as \"Lik-Lik Shops\" after the Tok Pisin word for \"small\".\n\nTabubil is powered by a hydro-electric station at Ok Menga, capable of producing 10 megawatts of electricity, and has a backup diesel power generating plant.\n\nThe main industrial hub is at the south end of the airport. This area was originally known locally as the 'Lay-Down' area, due to the fact that it was the storage location for much of the materials shipped in for the construction of the town. It is currently officially known as the ward of Laytown.\n\nA sawmill (now disused) is located at Sawmill Creek.\n\nTabubil itself is situated amongst dense jungle on a plateau, beside a steep escarpment leading down to the Ok Tedi River in the Star Mountains of Papua New Guinea. The township is very remote and is only accessible via air, or river barge followed by road.\n\nTabubil has an international airport (IATA code TBG) with a 1280-metre (4200 ft) dirt and gravel airstrip. Most passenger traffic is handled by daily flights to Port Moresby or Mount Hagen and tri-weekly flights to Cairns in Australia by Asia Pacific Airlines Dash 8s. Prior to the introduction of Dash 8 services, a King Air Super 200 was used for mine traffic.\n\nAsia Pacific Airlines is a local company with head offices in Tabubil, and Airlines PNG, Mission Aviation Fellowship and Air Niugini also fly to Tabubil Regularly. Tabubil was also regularly serviced by Talair before it was disbanded.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Tabubil was a small camp. Before construction of the town, Tabubil's first airstrip was in a different location, and a different angle to the airstrip that exists today. Air travel was instrumental in the development of the town, as there were no roads and the Kiunga-Tabubil Highway, which was a major logistical problem, was not constructed yet.\n\nThere are some sealed main streets in Tabubil, and several unsealed minor roads. The central north-south road in the town, separating the 'B' and 'C' houses is called \"Spine Road\", and is closed to vehicular traffic by large boulders at the end of each local road, apart from a small section at the south that is used for access to a group of townhouses. This non-vehicular road creates a well used and safe walkway through the town. Market stalls are common on this road, and there are two \"lik-lik\" stores adjacent to the road, and the town's only public park and playground.\n\nAll major roads are sealed and contain numerous \"floodways\" which allow the large amounts of rain in the town to wash over the road without obstructing traffic.\n\nThe most common form of roadkill in town is snakes, which will often stretch across the road seeking heat from the bitumen.\n\nThe township is situated upon an unsealed highway.  One end of the highway terminates at Ok Tedi mine, about 30 km by road to the northwest. The other end of the highway terminates at the river port of Kiunga, the most northern navigable point of the Fly River, about 100 km to the south. Buses, private vehicles, and heavy trucking operations run along this route. This highway is used for transportation of supplies to the town and to the mine from barges on the Fly River. The highway is heavily used by trucking operations heading to and from the port. Slurry of copper concentrate from the mine is sent to the river port along a 137 km pipeline which runs parallel to this highway. The Kiunga-Tabubil Highway is one of the only all-weather roads in the province, and most other roads in the district feed into this remote highway.\n\nExcept in cases of severe drought, most supplies to the mine are delivered by barge along the Fly River, which can be accessed by a port in Kiunga on the southern terminus of the Kiunga-Tabubil Highway. All the produce from the mine and all local exports are sent from this port. The Fly river has a water level which is often too low for shipping, and barges are often banked mid-passage. River barge followed by truck is the only way to supply the township apart from air cargo.\n\nIt is not uncommon for residents to access other remote areas by foot.  Most locals can tell you how many days it would take to walk to most locations within the country.  Walking often is the only way for people to get to their local villages anyway, as many local airstrips are in disrepair. The maintenance of airstrips is a Local Level Government responsibility, and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.\n\n"}
{"id": "2035609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035609", "title": "Dolby Stereo", "text": "Dolby Stereo\n\nDolby Stereo is a sound format made by Dolby Laboratories. There are two basic Dolby Stereo systems: the Dolby SVA (stereo variable-area) system used with optical sound tracks on 35mm film, and Dolby Stereo 70mm which refers to Dolby noise reduction on 6-channel magnetic soundtracks on 70mm prints. Dolby Pro Logic is the domestic equivalent of Dolby stereo and Dolby Surround is the name of the encoding technology used by playback software compatible with Dolby Pro Logic. \n\nOf the two, Dolby SVA was by far the more significant, as it brought high-quality stereo sound within the reach of virtually every cinema. Though 7-track magnetic stereo had been used in Cinerama films since 1952, and Fox had introduced 4-track stereo magnetic sound as part of the CinemaScope system in 1953, the technology had proved to be expensive and unreliable. Except in large cities, most movie theaters did not have facilities for playing back magnetic soundtracks, and a majority of films continued to be produced with mono optical soundtracks. Dolby SVA provided a method for putting high-quality stereo soundtracks on optical sound prints.\n\nThe optical soundtrack on a Dolby Stereo encoded 35 mm film carries not only and tracks for stereophonic sound, but also—through a matrix decoding system (Dolby Motion Picture matrix or Dolby MP) similar to that developed for \"quadraphonic\" or \"quad\" sound in the 1970s—a third center channel, and a fourth surround channel for speakers on the sides and rear of the theater for ambient sound and special effects. This yielded a total of four sound channels, as in the 4-track magnetic system, in the track space formerly allocated for one mono optical channel. Dolby also incorporated its A-Type noise reduction into the Dolby Stereo system.\n\nThe original involvement by Dolby Labs in movie sound was when film studios used Dolby A type noise reduction on studio magnetic film recordings. The first film to use Dolby noise reduction throughout the production process was \"A Clockwork Orange\", though much of the benefit was lost when it was released with a standard \"Academy\" optical soundtrack. This led to a proposal from Dolby that A type noise reduction be applied to the optical soundtrack on release prints.\n\nAt that time (early 1970s) there was renewed interest in improving the quality of optical soundtracks, which had changed little since the 1930s. In particular, the infamous \"Academy curve\" (the standard frequency response for cinema playback of optical tracks as specified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1938) was still in use. It involved a drastic roll-off in the high-frequency response of the theater system with the intention of reducing the audibility of noise and distortion. Dolby proposed replacing the Academy curve with Dolby A type noise reduction on the track. Starting with the 1974 film \"Callan\", ten films were released with a Dolby encoded mono soundtrack. Theaters were equipped with a Dolby A type noise reduction module and a third-octave equalizer to equalize the electro-acoustic frequency response of the speakers/auditorium. It created a new international standard for cinema sound.\n\nThough the system worked well, theater owners were reluctant to invest in the technology until stereo was added to the mix. The idea of putting a two-channel optical stereo soundtrack in the normal soundtrack area of a film print was not new; the stereo pioneer Alan Blumlein had made experimental stereophonic films using such a system as early as 1933, and J. G. Frayne of Westrex had proposed a similar system to the SMPTE in 1955.\n\nBy 1970, however, it was apparent that magnetic recording methods were not going to displace optical soundtracks on most release prints, and in the early 1970s Eastman Kodak revived the idea, as described by R. E. Uhlig in a paper presented to the SMPTE in 1972. Initially using a two-channel, 16m film recorder built for them by RCA, Kodak recorded two-channel stereo soundtracks much as Blumlein and Frayne had done before, but added Dolby noise reduction to improve the limited dynamic range available from these half-width tracks.\n\nThere was one problem left to solve: the absence of a center channel, regarded as essential to lock screen-center dialogue to the middle of the screen. Uhlig discussed this issue in a follow-up paper. He considered the possibility of splitting the soundtrack area three ways to provide a third center channel, but dismissed it because of the negative impact it would have on dynamic range and the problems involved in converting film projectors. Instead he suggested feeding a center-channel speaker with a simple mix of the left and right channels; however, this is not entirely satisfactory as it degrades the stereo separation.\n\nAt this time Dolby joined forces with Kodak in developing this system. Dolby's solution to the center-channel problem was to use a \"directionally enhanced\" matrix decoder, based on those developed for domestic \"Quadraphonic\" systems, to recover a center channel from left and right channels recorded on the film. The matrix decoder originally employed for this used the Sansui QS matrix under license. This system was used for the 1975 Ken Russell film \"Lisztomania\".\n\nThe matrix was then extended to provide a fourth channel for surround loudspeakers, allowing for a 4-channel system with the same speaker layout as the CinemaScope 4-track magnetic stereo system of the 1950s, but at a far lower cost.\n\nDolby Stereo, as this 4-channel system was now branded, was first used in 1976's \"A Star is Born\". From spring 1979 onward, a new custom matrix replaced the Sansui QS matrix. It was first used in that year's \"Hair\" and \"Hurricane\".\n\nAt first Dolby Stereo equipment was installed mainly in larger theaters already equipped with amplifiers and speakers for CinemaScope 4-track stereo. But the success of 1977's \"Star Wars\", which used the 4-channel system to great effect, encouraged owners of smaller theaters to install stereo equipment for the first time.\n\nA key feature of this system was its backward compatibility: the same print could play anywhere, from an old drive-in theater with mono sound to a Dolby Stereo-equipped cinema, eliminating the need for a costly double inventory of prints for distribution. The success of Dolby Stereo resulted in the final demise of magnetic stereo on 35mm release prints. From then on, only 70mm prints used magnetic sound.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dolby SR noise reduction began to replace Dolby A type NR in 35mm motion picture exhibition. All release prints encoded with Dolby Digital include a Dolby SR analog soundtrack, both as a backup in case the digital track malfunctions and for theaters not equipped for Dolby Digital playback.\n\nToday, as of 2019; Dolby Stereo still exists, although its market share in the cinema space has quite declined, with the advent of digital cinema. It serves as a backup for movie theaters, still exhibiting films on 35mm film.\n\nThe Dolby Stereo Matrix is straightforward: the four original channels: Left (L), Center (C), Right (R), and Surround (S), are combined into two, known as Left-total (LT) and Right-total (RT) by this formula:\nwhere \"j = 90° phase-shift\"\n\nThis center channel information is carried by both LT and RT in phase, and surround channel information by both LT and RT but out of phase. This gives good compatibility with both mono playback, which reproduces L, C and R from the mono speaker with C at a level 3dB higher than L or R, but surround information cancels out. It also gives good compatibility with two-channel stereo playback where C is reproduced from both left and right speakers to form a phantom center and surround is reproduced from both speakers but in a diffuse manner.\n\nA simple 4-channel decoder could simply send the sum signal (L+R) to the center speaker, and the difference signal (L-R) to the surrounds. But such a decoder would provide poor separation between adjacent speaker channels, thus anything intended for the center speaker would also reproduce from left and right speakers only 3dB below the level in the center speaker. Similarly anything intended for the left speaker would be reproduced from both the center and surround speakers, again only 3dB below the level in the left speaker. There is, however, complete separation between left and right, and between center and surround channels.\n\nTo overcome this problem the cinema decoder uses so-called \"logic\" circuitry to improve the separation. The logic circuitry decides which speaker channel has the highest signal level and gives it priority, attenuating the signals fed to the adjacent channels. Because there already is complete separation between opposite channels there is no need to attenuate those, in effect the decoder switches between L and R priority and C and S priority. This places some limitations on mixing for Dolby Stereo and to ensure that sound mixers mixed soundtracks appropriately they would monitor the sound mix via a Dolby Stereo encoder and decoder in tandem. In addition to the logic circuitry the surround channel is also fed via a delay, adjustable up to 100 ms to suit auditoria of differing sizes, to ensure that any leakage of program material intended for left or right speakers into the surround channel is always heard first from the intended speaker. This exploits the \"Precedence effect\" to localize the sound to the intended direction.\n\nDolby Surround was the earliest consumer version of Dolby's multichannel analog film sound format Dolby Stereo. \n\nDue to the compatibility of the Dolby Stereo matrix with mono and stereo playback, when films originally made in Dolby Stereo were released on stereo domestic video formats, such as VHS-HiFi or laserdisc, or broadcast on stereo TV the original two-channel Dolby Stereo soundtrack could be used. Some domestic listeners were keen to hear these soundtracks in a manner more akin to how they would have sounded in the theater and for that market some manufacturers produced simplified surround decoders. To keep the cost down these decoders dispensed with a center speaker output and the logic circuitry found on the professional decoder, but did include the surround delay. To distinguish these decoders from the professional units found in cinemas they were given the name \"Dolby Surround\" decoders. The term \"Dolby Surround\" was also licensed by Dolby for use on TV programs or straight-to-video movies recorded through the Dolby Stereo matrix.\n\nBy the late 1980s integrated-circuit manufacturers were working on designing integrated-circuit matrix decoders. A typical early example is the SSM-2125 from PMI. The SSM-2125 is a complete Dolby Stereo matrix decoder (except for the surround delay) on a single chip, it allowed domestic decoders which used the same logic system found in professional decoders to be marketed to the consumer. These decoders were thus given the name Dolby Pro Logic.\n\nDolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track refers to the use of Dolby noise reduction on the six magnetic soundtracks of a 70 mm print. This was first used on some prints of the MGM film \"Logan's Run\" released in 1976. \n\nThe Todd-AO format was introduced in 1955 and included multi-channel magnetic sound from the start, it does not have an optical soundtrack (although in recent years some 70mm prints have used a DTS digital track in place of the analogue magnetic one).\n\nThe original layout was for 5 front channels and one surround. But by the 1970s the use of the intermediate (left-center and right-center) tracks had been largely abandoned, these channels either being left blank, or filled with a simple mix of the adjacent channels. Dolby did not approve of this later practice, which results in loss of separation, but instead used these channels for LFE (low-frequency enhancement) utilizing the bass units of the otherwise redundant intermediate front speakers. Later the unused HF capacity of these channels was used to provide for stereo surround in place of the mono surround of the Todd-AO layout giving the modern 5.1 channel allocation retained today by Dolby Digital.\n\nBy 1984, Dolby Stereo had a competitor. Ultra Stereo Labs had introduced a comparable stereo optical sound system, Ultra Stereo. Its cinema processor introduced improvements in matrix decoding and convolution matching with greater channel separation. An included balancing circuit compensated for film weave and some imbalances between the left and right tracks that previously caused voice leakage into the surround channel. The Ultra Stereo sound system won a 1984 Technical Achievement Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\n"}

The hills are a popular country park area and they afford panoramic views over much of the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe hills had been a royal hunting reserve belonging to the Manor of Bromsgrove. Free public open access began in 1888 when Rednal Hill was bought by the Birmingham Society for the Preservation of Open Space. The Society then presented it to the City of Birmingham in trust. Pinfield Wood and Bilberry Hill were then leased at a nominal rent. Beacon Hill was bought by Edward, George and Henry Cadbury in 1907 and then given to the City of Birmingham. Cofton Hill, Lickey Warren and Pinfield Wood were bought in 1920. The final stage in restoring public access to the area was the purchase of the Rose Hill Estate from the Cadbury family in 1923. Although fully owned and maintained by Birmingham City Council, only a small part of the Lickey Hills Country Park is within its boundary, the rest being in Worcestershire.\n\nThe Lickey Hills consist of two parallel ranges with a valley between. The Lickey Hills Country Park of 525 acres (2 km²) belonging to Birmingham City Council and a golf club covers part of the hills. The lower range, known as the Lickey Ridge, consists of three hard quartzite hilltops, Rednal Hill, Bilberry Hill and Cofton Hill.

A tapestry map woven about the time of the Spanish Armada (1588) shows the huge iron basket on top of Beacon Hill where two men kept watch night and day.\n\nDuring the Second World War the Army's Royal Engineers built a range of buildings on top of Beacon Hill that were used by Air Raid Wardens, who acted as fire watchers over the south of Birmingham and Royal Observer Corps aircraft spotters who activated the air raid sirens for Rednal, Rubery, Northfield, the Austin motors factory and the Austin Aero aircraft factory at Cofton Hackett. The range of buildings included a dormitory-rest room block and an open topped toilet range. The latter building, the toilet block still painted in army khaki, was located just under the cover of the tree line and remained in use by the public as late as the early 1970s.\n\nDuring the extremely cold winters that affected the Birmingham area during the 1950s the northern slope of Beacon Hill was frequently covered by snow for several weeks each year and was used daily by hundreds of families for sledging. In recent years milder winters have not produced sufficient snow and the slope has been reduced in scope by housing development and expansion of the Municipal Golfcourse.\n\nStanding on the apex of the hill, is a toposcope which was built to commemorate the gift of the land to the City of Birmingham in 1907 by the Cadbury family. The small castle-like structure that houses it was rebuilt in 1988 to celebrate the centenary of the country park. It is above sea level, and provides views of the city and stands adjacent to the Ordnance Survey triangulation point.\n\nIn the hills there is an obelisk commemorating the sixth Earl of Plymouth (died 1833) as gratitude for his work in forming the Worcestershire Yeomanry volunteer regiment of cavalry.\n\nThe Lickey Incline runs about south of the hills — since 1964 it has been reputedly the steepest sustained adhesion-worked gradient (approximately 2 miles at 1 in 38, steepest grade 1 in 36) on the UK railway system.\n\nAccording to legend, the Devil and his accomplice, named Harry-ca-nab, used to hunt wild boar in the Lickey Hills, mounted on white bulls.\n\n\n\n"}

Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the title \"Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gases\", as documented by the Fondazione Barsanti e Matteucci.\n\nBorn in Lucca, Tuscany, Matteucci studied hydraulic and mechanical engineering, first in Paris, then in Florence. In 1851 he met Father Barsanti and appreciated his ideas for a new type of engine. They worked together to turn the primary concept into a manufacturable item, eventually developing a model suitable for mass production. Its construction was entrusted to Bauer & Co. of Milan, a company also known as Helvetica, which delivered the motor at the beginning of 1863.\n\nThe success of the engine, which was much more efficient that the steam-engine, was so great that orders started pouring in from as far away as Constantinople. Matteucci and Barsanti reached an agreement for the production of the motor with a company in Belgium, and Barsanti departed for Belgium on February 18, 1864 to oversee the work personally. On the following April 19, Barsanti died suddenly, and all their work came to an end.\n\nMatteucci returned to his previous work as a hydraulic engineer. He studied new hydrometers (to measure the level of a river), rain gauges, and hydraulic operations over rivers.\n\nIn 1877, Matteucci defended that he and Barsanti were the originators of the invention of the internal combustion engine. The patent registered by Nicolaus August Otto was indeed very similar to the Barsanti-Matteucci engine. This frustration contributed to Matteucci's illness that eventually caused his death, in his own home in Capannori, near Lucca. The documents concerning the priority of Barsanti and Matteucci’s engine and their patents in England, Piedmont, France, Belgium and Prussia are kept in the archive of the library of the Museo Galileo in Florence.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the second-northernmost and second-oldest public bridge in Budapest.\n\nIt was designed by French engineer Ernest Goüin and built by the construction company Maison Ernest Goüin et Cie. between 1872 and 1876, the engineer in charge being Émile Nouguier. Margaret Bridge was the second permanent bridge in Budapest after Széchenyi Chain Bridge. This bridge leads up to Margaret Island, its two parts enclosing 165 degrees with each other at the embranchment towards the island. The reason for this unusual geometry is that the small extension to connect to Margaret Island was hastily inserted into the original design but not built until two decades later due to lack of funds.\n\nThe bridge's two ends are\n\nIt is in length and in width.\n\nAll the bridges of Budapest were blown up by World War II Wehrmacht sapper troops in January 1945 during their retreat to the Buda side of the surrounded capital. However, Margaret Bridge had been damaged earlier, on 4 November 1944, when an accidental explosion destroyed the eastern span of the bridge. Estimates of the number of victims range from 100 to 600: Among them were innocent civilians, about 40 German soldiers, passengers in a tram that overturned and plunged into the river, and Jewish forced laborers(including Olympic champion fencer Endre Kabos), who were on the bridge in a truck. During reconstruction, much of the original steel material was lifted from the river and incorporated into the rebuilt structure.\n\nBy the beginning of the 2000s, the bridge was in very bad shape. It became life-threatening therefore, its reconstruction became very important. The recondition (after the Megyeri Bridge and Szabadság Bridge completion) began 21 August 2009. It was closed to road traffic for at least a year, but trams maintained a partial service over the bridge using temporary track. The whole project took more than 20 billion forints and half of the costs were financed from EU funds. The restoration was completed in 2011. They tried to restore the original appearance of the bridge. Instead of reinforced concrete, durable steel was used and new barriers and floodlights were installed. The middle lanes were widened, the sidewalk expanded by approx. 2 meters and the bike path completed.\n\nSoon after the bridge was inaugurated, it became a preferred spot for people seeking to take their own lives over personal or financial troubles. The wave of suicides inspired János Arany, a renowned Hungarian poet to compose a ballad, \"\"Híd-avatás\"\" (\"Bridge Inauguration\"), about the jumpers. It was widely distributed in leaflet format, illustrated with Mihály Zichy's romantic styled intricate pencil drawings.\n\n\n"}

Her first novel, \"Caucasia\" (1998), has been translated into multiple languages and has won several awards. The winner of a Whiting Award, Senna is the author of five books and numerous essays centering on issues of gender, race and motherhood; her most recent work is the novel \"New People\" (2017). Her writing has appeared in \"The New Yorker,\" \"Vogue\" and \"The New York Times.\" She is a professor of English at the University of Southern California.\n\nDanzy Senna was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, the middle child of two writers, poet and novelist Fanny Howe, and author and editor Carl Senna (\"The Fallacy of IQ;\" \"The Black Press and the Fight for Civil Rights\"). Her mother is white; her father is African-American. Growing up, Senna attended Boston public schools as well as the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts, an alternative school in Roxbury founded to instill racial pride in black children through arts education. Senna graduated from Brookline High School.\n\nShe did her undergraduate degree at Stanford University, where she was the founder and editor of the literary journal, \"Enigma: The Stanford Journal of Black Expression.\" She earned an MFA in creative writing from University of California, Irvine, where she began and completed her first novel, \"Caucasia\".\n\nSenna's first novel, \"Caucasia\" (1998), received the Book of the Month Club's Stephen Crane Award for First Fiction, was nominated for the Orange Prize for Fiction, and won the Alex Award from the American Library Association. The novel was also longlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award and was named a \"Los Angeles Times\" \"Best Book of the Year\". \"Caucasia\", a national bestseller, has been translated into ten languages. \"Caucasia\" is narrated by a young biracial girl, Birdie Lee, who is taken into the political underground by her mother, and forced to live under an assumed identity. The coming of age story follows Birdie's struggle for identity and her search for the missing parts of her family.\n\nHer second novel, \"Symptomatic\" (2004), is a psychological thriller narrated by an unnamed young woman who moves to New York City for what promises to be a dream job – a prestigious fellowship writing for a respected magazine. The narrator feels displaced, however, and is unsure of how she fits into the world around her. She becomes the object of an older woman's attention after they bond over their similarly mixed heritage. As the older woman's interest turns into obsession, the narrator must figure out what their relationship means to her, even as both of their lives seem to spiral out of control.\n\nAs a fellow at the New York Public Library’s Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers, Senna researched and wrote the autobiographical work, \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?: A Personal History\" (2009). She recounts the story of her parents, who married in 1968. Their marriage was opposed by some family members and friends as the two American writers came from wildly divergent backgrounds. Her mother was a white woman with a blue-blood Bostonian lineage. Her father was a black man, the son of a single mother and an unknown father. When their marriage disintegrated eight years later, one family friend called it \"the ugliest divorce in Boston’s history.\" Decades later, Senna looked back not only at her parents’ divorce, but at the family histories they tried so hard to overcome. Her often painful journey through the past is epitomized by the question posed to her as a young child by her father: \"Don’t you know who I am?\". In 2010, Danzy's father, Carl Senna, sued Senna for \"libel, privacy invasion, fraud, and misappropriation of his name and likeness\" in the book and claimed she had misled him in telling him what the book was about in order to get information from him for the work.\n\nSenna's short story collection, \"You Are Free\" (2011), was described by Kirkus Review as, \"Deft, revealing stories [from] a writer for our time...a fresh, insightful look into being young, smart and biracial in postmillennial America.\" In the title story, a woman’s strange correspondence with a girl claiming to be her daughter leads her into the doubts and what-ifs of the life she hasn’t lived. In \"The Care of the Self,\" a new mother hosts an old friend, still single, and discovers how each of them pities and envies the other. In the collection's first story, \"Admission,\" tensions arise between a liberal husband and wife after their son is admitted into the elite daycare school to which they’d applied only on a lark.\n\nSenna's most recent book, \"New People\" (2017) was named by \"Time\" magazine as one of the Top Ten Novels of 2017. \"New People\" tells the story of mixed-race Maria and her fiancé Khalil, who live together in '90s Fort Greene, then populated by black artists and bohemians. The seemingly perfect \"King and Queen of the Racially Nebulous Prom\" is troubled by Maria's fixation on a black poet she barely knows. The novel was in part inspired by Senna's fascination with the Jonestown massacre. Doreen St. Félix writing for the \"New Yorker\" praised the novel for making \" keen, icy farce of the affectations of the Brooklyn black faux-bohemia.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Then for any other probability distribution\n\nthe following inequality between positive quantities (since p and q are between zero and one) holds:\n\nwith equality if and only if\n\nfor all \"i\". Put in words, the information entropy of a distribution P is less than or equal to its cross entropy with any other distribution Q.\n\nThe difference between the two quantities is the Kullback–Leibler divergence or relative entropy, so the inequality can also be written:\n\nNote that the use of base-2 logarithms is optional, and \nallows one to refer to the quantity on each side of the inequality as an \n\"average surprisal\" measured in bits.\n\nFor simplicity, we prove the statement using the natural logarithm (ln), since\n\nthe particular logarithm we choose only scales the relationship.\n\nLet formula_7 denote the set of all formula_8 for which \"p\" is non-zero. Then, since formula_9 for all \"x > 0\", with equality if and only if \"x=1\", we have:\n\nThe last inequality is a consequence of the \"p\" and \"q\" being part of a probability distribution. Specifically, the sum of all non-zero values is 1. Some non-zero \"q\", however, may have been excluded since the choice of indices is conditioned upon the \"p\" being non-zero. Therefore the sum of the \"q\" may be less than 1.\n\nSo far, over the index set formula_7, we have:\n\nor equivalently\n\nBoth sums can be extended to all formula_15, i.e. including formula_16, by recalling that the expression formula_17 tends to 0 as formula_18 tends to 0, and formula_19 tends to formula_20 as formula_21 tends to 0. We arrive at \n\nFor equality to hold, we require\n\nThis can happen if and only if formula_31 for formula_32.\n\nThe result can alternatively be proved using Jensen's inequality, the log sum inequality, or the fact that the Kullback-Leibler divergence is a form of Bregman divergence. Below we give a proof based on Jensen's inequality:\n\nBecause log is a concave function, we have that:\n\nWhere the first inequality is due to Jensen's inequality, and the last equality is because formula_21 is a probability distribution.\n\nFurthermore, since formula_35 is strictly concave, by the equality condition of Jensen's inequality we get equality when\n\nSuppose that this ratio is formula_37, then we have that\n\nWhere we use the fact that formula_39 are probability distributions. Therefore the equality happens when formula_40.\n\nThe entropy of formula_41 is bounded by:\n\nThe proof is trivial – simply set formula_43 for all \"i\".\n\n"}

The Red Hill Railway, the country's first train, ran from Red Hills to Chintadripet bridge in Madras in 1837. It was hauled by a rotary steam-engine locomotive manufactured by William Avery. Built by Arthur Cotton, the railway was primarily used to transport laterite stone for road-building work in Madras. In 1845, the Godavari Dam Construction Railway was built at Dowleswaram in Rajahmundry. Also built by Cotton, it supplied stone for the construction of a dam over the Godavari River.\n\nOn 8 May 1845, the Madras Railway was incorporated, followed that year by the East India Railway. On 1 August 1849, the Great Indian Peninsular Railway was incorporated by an act of parliament. The \"guarantee system\", providing free land and a guaranteed five-percent rate of return to private British companies willing to build railways, was finalized on 17 August 1849. In 1851, the Solani Aqueduct Railway was built in Roorkee. It was hauled by the Thomason steam locomotive, named after a British officer-in-charge of that name. The railway transported construction materials for an aqueduct over the Solani River. In 1852, the Madras Guaranteed Railway Company was incorporated.\n\nThe country's first passenger train, which ran between Bombay's Bori Bunder station and Thane on 16 April 1853, was dedicated by Lord Dalhousie. The 14-carriage train was hauled by three steam locomotives: the \"Sahib\", \"Sindh\", and \"Sultan\". Travelling , the train carried 400 people. The passenger line was built and operated by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR). It was built in broad gauge, which became the country's standard for railways.\n\nIn May 1854, the Bombay–Thane line was extended to Kalyan with the Thane viaducts over the Thane creek (India's first railway bridges). The first passenger train in eastern India ran from Howrah (near Calcutta) to Hoogly, a distance of , on 15 August 1854. The line was built and operated by the East Indian Railway Company (EIR). That year, the GIPR opened its first workshops in Byculla. In 1855, the BB&CI Railway was incorporated. That August, the EIR \"Express\" and \"Fairy Queen\" steam locomotives were introduced.\n\nSouth India's first passenger train ran from Royapuram–Veyasarapady (Madras) to Wallajah Road in Arcot, a distance of , on 1 July 1856. It was built and operated by the Madras Railway. The Madras Railway's first workshop opened in Perambur (near Madras) that year, and the Bombay-Thane line was extended to Khopoli. In 1858, the Eastern Bengal Railway was incorporated.\n\nIndia's first tramway (a horse-drawn tramway) opened in Calcutta between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat Street, a distance of , on 24 February 1873. The following year, the Great South Indian and Carnatic Railways merged to form the South Indian Railway Company. On 9 May 1874, a horse-drawn tramway began operation in Bombay between Colaba and Parel. The Calcutta Tramways Company was incorporated in 1880, followed a decade later by the East Coast State Railway.\n\nLighting in passenger coaches was introduced by many railway companies in 1897. In 1902, the Jodhpur Railway was the first to introduce electric lighting as standard fixtures. Electric signal lighting was introduced between Dadar and Currey Road in Bombay in 1920.\n\nThe first railway budget was presented in 1925. On 3 February 1925, the first electric passenger train in India ran between Victoria Terminus (VT) and Kurla on 1,500 V DC overhead traction. Cammell Laird and Uerdingenwagonfabrik manufactured the locomotives for this train. The VT-Bandra section was electrified (with an elevated platform at Sandhurst Road), the Oudh and Rohilkhund Railway was merged with the EIR, the first railway budget was presented in the same year. In 1926, the Kurla-Kalyan section was electrified with 1,500 V DC. Electrification to Poona and Igatpuri (both 1,500 V DC) over the Bhore and Thal Ghats was also completed, and the Charbagh railway station in Lucknow was built that year. The Bandra-Virar section was electrified with 1,500 V DC in January 1928.\n\nThe Frontier Mail made its inaugural run between Bombay VT and Peshawar in 1928. The country's first automatic color-light signals became operational, on GIPR's lines between Bombay VT and Byculla. In 1928, the Kanpur Central and Lucknow stations opened. The Grand Trunk Express began running between Peshawar and Mangalore, the Punjab Limited Express began running between Mumbai and Lahore, and automatic color-light signaling was extended to the Byculla-Kurla section the following year. On 1 June 1930, the \"Deccan Queen\" began service (hauled by a WCP-1—No. 20024, old number EA/1 4006) with seven coaches on the GIPR's electrified route from Bombay VT to Poona. The Hyderabad Godavari Valley Railway was merged into Nizam's State Railway and the route of the Grand Trunk Express was changed to Delhi-Madras that year.\n\nThe re-organisation of railways in India into regional zones began in 1951. On 14 April of that year, the Southern Railway zone was created. On 5 November, the Central and Western Railway zones were created. That year, the post of Chief Commissioner of Railways was abolished and the Railway Board adopted the practice of making its senior-most member the chairman of the board. The government of West Bengal also entered into an agreement with the Calcutta Tramways Company to take over its administrative functions that year. The Northern, Eastern and North Eastern Railway zones were created on 14 April 1952.\n\nFans and lights were mandated for all compartments in all classes of passenger accommodations in 1952, and sleeping accommodations were introduced in coaches. On 1 August 1955, the South-Eastern zone was split off from the Eastern Railway zone. A divisional system of administration was established for the zones in 1956, and the first fully air-conditioned train was introduced (between Howrah and Delhi).\n\nIn 1957, after successful trials in France, SNCF proposed 25 kV AC electrification for India's railways. Indian Railways decided to adopt 25 kV AC electrification, choosing SNCF as a technical consultant. The Main Line Electrification Project (which later became the Railway Electrification Project and, still later, the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification) was established that year. In 1958, the Northeast Frontier Railway zone split off from the North Eastern zone. In 1959, Raj Kharswan to Dangoaposi was the first section electrified with 25 kV AC traction. The first scheduled train using 25 kV AC traction ran on the Raj Kharswan-Dangoaposi section on 11 August 1960. The first containerized freight service began between Bombay and Ahmedabad in 1966, and 25 kV AC electrification of several suburban tracks around Delhi, Madras and Calcutta was completed. In 1979, the Main Line Electrification Project became the Central Organization for Railway Electrification (CORE).\n\nIndia's first metro train ran from Esplanade to Bhowanipur (now the Netaji Bhawan station) in Calcutta on 24 October 1984, and the Calcutta Metro was the country's first rapid-transit line.\n\nIn 1986, computerized ticketing and reservations were introduced in New Delhi. The Shatabdi Express, India's fastest train, was introduced between New Delhi and Jhansi in 1988; the line was later extended to Bhopal. In 1990, the first self-printing ticket machine (SPTM) was introduced in New Delhi. Air-conditioned, three-tier coaches and a sleeper class (separate from Second Class) were introduced in 1993.\n\nOn 16 January 1995, the first regularly-scheduled service with 2 x 25 kV traction began on the Bina-Katni line. In September 1996, the CONCERT system of computerized reservations began in New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. In 1998, coupon-validating machines (CVMs) were introduced at Mumbai CST. The CONCERT system became operational nationwide on 18 April 1999; the South East Central Railway zone was established and credit cards were accepted for tickets and reservations at some stations that year. In February 2000, the Indian Railways website went online. On 6 July 2002, the East Coast, South Western, South East Central, North Central and West Central Railway zones were created. Indian Railways (IR) began online train reservations and ticketing on 3 August of that year, with Internet ticketing extended to many cities on 1 December. On 5 February 2012, The Western Railway zone (WR) ended its use of 1,500 V DC traction, switching to 25 kV AC traction. The Tatkal system of ticketing was extended to all trains on 26 September 2013.\n\nGatimaan Express, India's fastest train with a maximum speed of 160 km/h, made its maiden journey from Delhi to Agra on 5 April 2016. The Central Railway zone (CR) ended its use of DC traction in the Mumbai area and on the country's main-line rail network, switching to 25 kV AC traction on 11 April of that year. On 31 March 2017, IR announced that India's entire rail network would be electrified by 2022.\n\n\n"}

Before the 2011 local government reform it was a part of the municipality of Gytheio, of which it was a municipal district. The 2011 census recorded 234 residents in the village and 293 residents in the community. The community of Skoutari covers an area of 11.667 km. According to local tradition it was founded by refugees from the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nIn the Mycenaean period of Greece, there was thought to be a town called Vorthona which is now submerged. In Ancient Greece, the town used to be called Asine. The town was under Spartan control. In 218 BC, the inhabitants of Asine defeated the army of Philip V of Macedon who was besieging the town. During the Roman period it belong to Sparta ever though most of the other towns in the area were part of the Union of Free Laconians.\n\nThe modern town of Skoutari was founded in 1453 AD by refugees from the namesake district of Constantinople who fled from the Ottomans during the Fall of Constantinople. While the rest of Greece fell to the Ottoman Turks, Mani remained free. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Skoutari became a haven for pirates which rivalled Oitylo. The Ottomans tried to conquer Mani in 1770 and they laid siege to the tower of the Grigorakis clan which was one of the most powerful in Mani and whose base was Skoutari and they blew it up with gunpowder after a three-day siege. The Ottoman army was later defeated in the Battle of Vromopigada in the plain outside Skoutari and repelled from Mani. The Ottomans tried to capture Skoutari again in 1815 but they were defeated and driven back. In 1832, Greece was recognized as an independent state and Skoutari became part of it. During World War II, Greece was invaded by the Germans and Italians who captured Skoutari.\n\nNow Skoutari is a peaceful sea town with around 150 residents during summer. Skoutari was struck by a forest fire in the last days of July 2007, it did not consume as much of the area as the 2006 dangerous fires, several firefighters, helicopters and planes battled the fire for days and left some groves and forests in damages.\n\nSkoutari was built on a hill around 50 metres above the sea level.

{"id": "2035730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035730", "title": "Progressivism in the United States", "text": "Progressivism in the United States\n\nProgressivism in the United States is a political philosophy and reform movement that reached its height early in the 20th century. Middle class and reformist in nature, it arose as a response to the vast changes brought by modernization such as the growth of large corporations, pollution and rampant corruption in American politics.\n\nHistorian Alonzo Hamby describes American progressivism as a \"political movement that addresses ideas, impulses, and issues stemming from modernization of American society. Emerging at the end of the nineteenth century, it established much of the tone of American politics throughout the first half of the century\".\n\nIn the 21st century, progressives continue to embrace concepts such as environmentalism and social justice. While the modern progressive movement may be characterized as largely secular in nature, by comparison, the historical progressive movement was to a significant extent rooted in and energized by religion.\n\nHistorians debate the exact contours, but generally date the \"Progressive Era\" from the 1890s to either World War I or the onset of the Great Depression, in response to the excesses of the Gilded Age.\n\nMany of the core principles of the Progressive Movement focused on the need for efficiency in all areas of society. Purification to eliminate waste and corruption was a powerful element, as well as the Progressives' support of worker compensation, improved child labor laws, minimum wage legislation, a support for a maximum hours that workers could work for, graduated income tax and allowed women the right to vote.\n\nAccording to historian William Leuchtenburg:\nThe Progressives believed in the Hamiltonian concept of positive government, of a national government directing the destinies of the nation at home and abroad. They had little but contempt for the strict construction of the Constitution by conservative judges, who would restrict the power of the national government to act against social evils and to extend the blessings of democracy to less favored lands. The real enemy was particularism, state rights, limited government.\n\nProgressives repeatedly warned that illegal voting was corrupting the political system. They especially identified big-city bosses, working with saloon keepers and precinct workers, as the culprits who stuffed the ballot boxes. The solution to purifying the vote included prohibition (designed to close down the saloons), voter registration requirements (designed to end multiple voting), and literacy tests (designed to minimize the number of ignorant voters).\n\nAll of the Southern states (and Oklahoma) used devices to disenfranchise black voters during the Progressive Era. Typically the progressive elements in those states pushed for disenfranchisement, often fighting against the conservatism of the Black Belt whites. A major reason given was that whites routinely purchased black votes to control elections, and it was easier to disenfranchise blacks than to go after powerful white men.\n\nIn the North, Progressives such as William U'Ren and Robert La Follette argued that the average citizen should have more control over his government. The Oregon System of \"Initiative, Referendum, and Recall\" was exported to many states, including Idaho, Washington, and Wisconsin. Many progressives, such as George M. Forbes, president of Rochester's Board of Education, hoped to make government in the U.S. more responsive to the direct voice of the American people when he said:\n\n[W]e are now intensely occupied in forging the tools of democracy, the direct primary, the initiative, the referendum, the recall, the short ballot, commission government. But in our enthusiasm we do not seem to be aware that these tools will be worthless unless they are used by those who are aflame with the sense of brotherhood ... The idea [of the social centers movement is] to establish in each community an institution having a direct and vital relation to the welfare of the neighborhood, ward, or district, and also to the city as a whole\n\nPhilip J. Ethington seconds this high view of direct democracy saying:\ninitiatives, referendums, and recalls, along with direct primaries and the direct election of US Senators, were the core achievements of 'direct democracy' by the Progressive generation during the first two decades of the twentieth century.\n\nProgressives fought for women's suffrage to purify the elections using supposedly purer female voters. Progressives in the South supported the elimination of supposedly corrupt black voters from the election booth. Historian Michael Perman says that in both Texas and Georgia, \"disfranchisement was the weapon as well as the rallying cry in the fight for reform\"; and in Virginia, \"the drive for disfranchisement had been initiated by men who saw themselves as reformers, even progressives.\"\n\nWhile the ultimate significance of the progressive movement on today's politics is still up for debate, Alonzo L. Hamby asks:\nWhat were the central themes that emerged from the cacophony [of progressivism]? Democracy or elitism? Social justice or social control? Small entrepreneurship or concentrated capitalism? And what was the impact of American foreign policy? Were the progressives isolationists or interventionists? Imperialists or advocates of national self-determination? And whatever they were, what was their motivation? Moralistic utopianism? Muddled relativistic pragmatism? Hegemonic capitalism? Not surprisingly many battered scholars began to shout 'no mas!' In 1970, Peter Filene declared that the term 'progressivism' had become meaningless.\n\nThe Progressives typically concentrated on city and state government, looking for waste and better ways to provide services as the cities grew rapidly. These changes led to a more structured system, power that had been centralized within the legislature would now be more locally focused. The changes were made to the system to effectively make legal processes, market transactions, bureaucratic administration, and democracy easier to manage, thus putting them under the classification of \"Municipal Administration\". There was also a change in authority for this system; it was believed that the authority that was not properly organized had now given authority to professionals, experts, and bureaucrats for these services. These changes led to a more solid type of municipal administration compared to the old system that was underdeveloped and poorly constructed.\n\nThe Progressives mobilized concerned middle class voters, as well as newspapers and magazines, to identify problems and concentrate reform sentiment on specific problems. Many Protestants focused on the saloon as the power base for corruption, as well as violence and family disruption, so they tried to get rid of the entire saloon system through prohibition. Others (like Jane Addams in Chicago) promoted Settlement Houses. Early municipal reformers included Hazen S. Pingree (mayor of Detroit in the 1890s) and Tom L. Johnson in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1901, Johnson won election as mayor of Cleveland on a platform of just taxation, home rule for Ohio cities, and a 3-cent streetcar fare. Columbia University President Seth Low was elected mayor of New York City in 1901 on a reform ticket.\n\nMany progressives such as Louis Brandeis hoped to make American governments better able to serve the people's needs by making governmental operations and services more efficient and rational. Rather than making legal arguments against ten-hour workdays for women, he used \"scientific principles\" and data produced by social scientists documenting the high costs of long working hours for both individuals and society. The progressives' quest for efficiency was sometimes at odds with the progressives' quest for democracy. Taking power out of the hands of elected officials and placing that power in the hands of professional administrators reduced the voice of the politicians and in turn reduced the voice of the people. Centralized decision-making by trained experts and reduced power for local wards made government less corrupt but more distant and isolated from the people it served. Progressives who emphasized the need for efficiency typically argued that trained independent experts could make better decisions than the local politicians. Thus Walter Lippmann in his influential \"Drift and Mastery\" (1914), stressing the \"scientific spirit\" and \"discipline of democracy,\" called for a strong central government guided by experts rather than public opinion.\n\nOne example of progressive reform was the rise of the city manager system, in which paid, professional engineers ran the day-to-day affairs of city governments under guidelines established by elected city councils. Many cities created municipal \"reference bureaus\" which did expert surveys of government departments looking for waste and inefficiency. After in-depth surveys, local and even state governments were reorganized to reduce the number of officials and to eliminate overlapping areas of authority between departments. City governments were reorganized to reduce the power of local ward bosses and to increase the powers of the city council. Governments at every level began developing budgets to help them plan their expenditures (rather than spending money haphazardly as needs arose and revenue became available). Governor Frank Lowden of Illinois showed a \"passion for efficiency\" as he streamlined state government.\n\nCorruption represented a source of waste and inefficiency in the government. William U'Ren in Oregon, and Robert M. La Follette Sr. in Wisconsin, and others worked to clean up state and local governments by passing laws to weaken the power of machine politicians and political bosses. In Wisconsin, La Follette pushed through an open primary system that stripped party bosses of the power to pick party candidates. The Oregon System, which included a \"Corrupt Practices Act\", a public referendum, and a state-funded voter's pamphlet among other reforms was exported to other states in the northwest and Midwest. Its high point was in 1912, after which they detoured into a disastrous third party status.\n\nEarly progressive thinkers such as John Dewey and Lester Ward placed a universal and comprehensive system of education at the top of the progressive agenda, reasoning that if a democracy were to be successful, its leaders, the general public, needed a good education. Progressives worked hard to expand and improve public and private education at all levels. Modernization of society, they believed, necessitated the compulsory education of all children, even if the parents objected. Progressives turned to educational researchers to evaluate the reform agenda by measuring numerous aspects of education, later leading to standardized testing. Many educational reforms and innovations generated during this period continued to influence debates and initiatives in American education for the remainder of the 20th century. One of the most apparent legacies of the Progressive Era left to American education was the perennial drive to reform schools and curricula, often as the product of energetic grass-roots movements in the city.\n\nSince progressivism was and continues to be 'in the eyes of the beholder,' progressive education encompasses very diverse and sometimes conflicting directions in educational policy. Such enduring legacies of the Progressive Era continue to interest historians. Progressive Era reformers stressed 'object teaching,' meeting the needs of particular constituencies within the school district, equal educational opportunity for boys and girls, and avoiding corporal punishment.\n\nThe reformers emphasized professionalization and bureaucratization. The old system whereby ward politicians selected school employees was dropped in the case of teachers and replaced by a merit system requiring a college-level education in a normal school (teacher's college). The rapid growth in size and complexity the large urban school systems facilitated stable employment for women teachers and provided senior teachers greater opportunities to mentor younger teachers. By 1900 in Providence, Rhode Island, most women remained as teachers for at least 17.5 years, indicating teaching had become a significant and desirable career path for women.\n\nMany progressives hoped that by regulating large corporations they could liberate human energies from the restrictions imposed by industrial capitalism. Yet the progressive movement was split over which of the following solutions should be used to regulate corporations.\n\nPro-labor progressives such as Samuel Gompers argued that industrial monopolies were unnatural economic institutions which suppressed the competition which was necessary for progress and improvement. United States antitrust law is the body of laws that prohibits anti-competitive behavior (monopoly) and unfair business practices. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft supported trust-busting. During their presidencies, the otherwise-conservative Taft brought down 90 trusts in four years while Roosevelt took down 44 in 7 1/2 years in office.\n\nProgressives such as Benjamin Parke De Witt argued that in a modern economy, large corporations and even monopolies were both inevitable and desirable. With their massive resources and economies of scale, large corporations offered the U.S. advantages which smaller companies could not offer. Yet, these large corporations might abuse their great power. The federal government should allow these companies to exist but regulate them for the public interest. President Theodore Roosevelt generally supported this idea and was later to incorporate it as part of his \"New Nationalism\".\n\nProgressives set up training programs to ensure that welfare and charity work would be undertaken by trained professionals rather than warm-hearted amateurs.\n\nJane Addams of Chicago's Hull House typified the leadership of residential, community centers operated by social workers and volunteers and located in inner city slums. The purpose of the settlement houses was to raise the standard of living of urbanites by providing adult education and cultural enrichment programs.\n\nDuring this era of massive reformation among all social aspects, elimination of prostitution was vital for the progressives, especially the women.\n\nChild labor laws were designed to prevent the overuse of children in the newly emerging industries. The goal of these laws was to give working class children the opportunity to go to school and mature more institutionally, thereby liberating the potential of humanity and encouraging the advancement of humanity. Factory owners generally did not want this progression because of lost workers. They used Charles Dickens as a symbol that the working conditions spark imagination. This initiative failed, with child labor laws being enacted anyway.\n\nLabor unions grew steadily until 1916, then expanded fast during the war. In 1919 a wave of major strikes alienated the middle class; the strikes were lost, which alienated the workers. In the 1920s the unions were in the doldrums; in 1924 they supported La Follette's Progressive party, but he only carried his base in Wisconsin. The American Federation of Labor under Samuel Gompers after 1907 began supporting the Democrats, who promised more favorable judges. The Republicans appointed pro-business judges. Theodore Roosevelt and his third party also supported such goals as the eight-hour work day, improved safety and health conditions in factories, workers' compensation laws, and minimum wage laws for women.\n\nMost progressives, especially in rural areas, adopted the cause of prohibition. They saw the saloon as political corruption incarnate, and bewailed the damage done to women and children. They believed the consumption of alcohol limited mankind's potential for advancement. Progressives achieved success first with state laws then with the enactment of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The golden day did not dawn; enforcement was lax, especially in the cities where the law had very limited popular support and where notorious criminal gangs, such as the Chicago gang of Al Capone made a crime spree based on illegal sales of liquor in speakeasies. The \"experiment\" (as President Hoover called it) also cost the treasury large sums of taxes and the 18th amendment was repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1933.\n\nSome progressives sponsored eugenics as a solution to excessively large or under-performing families, hoping that birth control would enable parents to focus their resources on fewer, better children. Progressive leaders like Herbert Croly and Walter Lippmann indicated their classically liberal concern over the danger posed to the individual by the practice of eugenics.\n\nDuring the term of the progressive President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909) and influenced by the ideas of philosopher-scientists such as George Perkins Marsh, John Wesley Powell, John Muir, Lester Frank Ward and W. J. McGee, the largest government-funded conservation-related projects in U.S. history were undertaken.\n\nOn March 14, 1903, President Roosevelt created the first National Bird Preserve, (the beginning of the Wildlife Refuge system), on Pelican Island, Florida. In all, by 1909, the Roosevelt administration had created an unprecedented 42 million acres (170,000 km²) of United States National Forests, 53 National Wildlife Refuges and 18 areas of \"special interest\", such as the Grand Canyon.\n\nIn addition, Roosevelt approved the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902, which gave subsidies for irrigation in 13 (eventually 20) western states. Another conservation-oriented bill was the Antiquities Act of 1906 that protected large areas of land by allowing the President to declare areas meriting protection to be national monuments. The Inland Waterways Commission was appointed by Roosevelt on March 14, 1907 to study the river systems of the United States, including the development of water power, flood control, and land reclamation.\n\nIn the early 20th century, politicians of the Democratic and Republican parties, Lincoln–Roosevelt League Republicans (in California) and Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 Progressive (\"Bull Moose\") Party all pursued environmental, political, and economic reforms. Chief among these aims was the pursuit of trust busting, the breaking up very large monopolies, and support for labor unions, public health programs, decreased corruption in politics, and environmental conservation.\n\nThe progressive movement enlisted support from both major parties (and from minor parties as well). One leader, Democrat William Jennings Bryan, had won both the Democratic Party and the Populist Party nominations in 1896. At the time, the great majority of other major leaders had been opposed to Populism. When Roosevelt left the Republican Party in 1912, he took with him many of the intellectual leaders of progressivism, but very few political leaders. The Republican Party then became notably more committed to business-oriented and efficiency-oriented progressivism, typified by Taft and Herbert Hoover.\n\nThe foundation of the progressive tendency was indirectly linked to the unique philosophy of pragmatism, which was primarily developed by John Dewey and William James.\n\nEqually significant to progressive-era reform were the crusading journalists, known as muckrakers. These journalists publicized, to middle class readers, economic privilege, political corruption, and social injustice. Their articles appeared in \"McClure's Magazine\" and other reform periodicals. Some muckrakers focused on corporate abuses. Ida Tarbell, for instance, exposed the activities of the Standard Oil Company. In \"The Shame of the Cities\" (1904), Lincoln Steffens dissected corruption in city government. In \"Following the Color Line\" (1908), Ray Stannard Baker criticized race relations. Other muckrakers assailed the Senate, railroad companies, insurance companies, and fraud in patent medicine.\nNovelists criticized corporate injustices. Theodore Dreiser drew harsh portraits of a type of ruthless businessman in \"The Financier\" (1912) and \"The Titan\" (1914). In \"The Jungle\" (1906), Socialist Upton Sinclair repelled readers with descriptions of Chicago's meatpacking plants, and his work led to support for remedial food safety legislation.\n\nLeading intellectuals also shaped the progressive mentality. In \"Dynamic Sociology\" (1883) Lester Frank Ward laid out the philosophical foundations of the Progressive movement and attacked the laissez-faire policies advocated by Herbert Spencer and William Graham Sumner. In \"The Theory of the Leisure Class\" (1899), Thorstein Veblen attacked the \"conspicuous consumption\" of the wealthy. Educator John Dewey emphasized a child-centered philosophy of pedagogy, known as progressive education, which affected schoolrooms for three generations.\n\nProgressivism in the 21st century is significantly different from the historical progressivism of the 19th-20th centuries. According to Princeton economics professor Thomas C. Leonard, \"At a glance, there is not much here for 21st-century progressives to claim kinship with. Today’s progressives emphasize racial equality and minority rights, decry U.S. imperialism, shun biological ideas in social science, and have little use for piety or proselytizing.\" However, both historical progressivism and the modern movement shares the notion that the free markets lead to economic inequalities that must be ameliorated. Many modern progressives have used the term \"new progressivism\" to make this distinction.\n\nIncome inequality in the United States has been on the rise since 1970, as the wealthy continue to hold more and more wealth and income. For example, 95% of income gains from 2009 to 2013 went to the top 1% of wage earners in the United States. Progressives have recognized that lower union rates, weak policy, globalization, and other drivers have caused the gap in income. The rise of income inequality has led Progressives to draft legislation including, but not limited to, reforming Wall Street, reforming the tax code, reforming campaign finance, closing loopholes, and keeping domestic work.\n\nProgressives began to demand stronger Wall Street regulation after they perceived deregulation and relaxed enforcement as leading to the financial crisis of 2008. Passing the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory act in 2010 provided increased oversight on financial institutions and the creation of new regulatory agencies, but many Progressives argue its broad framework allows for financial institutions to continue to take advantage of consumers and the government. Bernie Sanders, among others, has advocated to reimplement Glass-Steagall for its stricter regulation and to break up the banks because of financial institutions' market share being concentrated in fewer corporations than progressives would like.\n\nIn 2009, the Congressional Progressive Caucus outlined five key healthcare principles they intended to pass into law. The CPC mandated a nationwide public option, affordable health insurance, insurance market regulations, an employer insurance provision mandate, and comprehensive services for children. In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was intended to increase the affordability and efficiency of the United States healthcare system. Although considered a success by progressives, many argued that it didn't go far enough in achieving healthcare reform, as exemplified with the Democrats' failure in achieving a national public option. In recent decades, Single-payer healthcare has become an important goal in healthcare reform for progressives. In 2016 Democratic Party primaries, progressive and democratic socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders raised the issue of a single-payer healthcare system, citing his belief that millions of Americans are still paying too much for health insurance, and arguing that millions more don't receive the care they need. In 2016, an effort was made to implement a single-payer healthcare system in the state of Colorado, known as ColoradoCare (Amendment 69). Senator Sanders held rallies in Colorado in support of the Amendment leading up to the vote. Despite high-profile support, Amendment 69 failed to pass, with just 21.23% of voting Colorado residents voting in favor, and 78.77% against.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, the minimum wage peaked in 1968 at around $9.90 (in 2020 dollars). Progressives believe that stagnating wages perpetuate income inequality and that raising the minimum wage is a necessary step to combat inequality. If the minimum wage grew at the rate of productivity growth in the United States, it would be $21.72 an hour, nearly three times as much as the current $7.25 an hour. Popular progressives such as Senator Bernie Sanders and former Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison have endorsed a federally mandated wage increase to $15 an hour. The movement has already seen success with its implementation in California with the passing of bill to raise the minimum wage $1 every year until reaching $15 an hour in 2021. New York workers are lobbying for similar legislation as many continue to rally for a minimum wage increase as part of the Fight for $15 movement.\n\nBlack Lives Matter is an international activist group that fights against police brutality and systemic racism. Black Lives Matter has organized protests against the deaths of African-Americans by police actions and crimes. These include protests against the deaths of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Korryn Gaines, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery.\n\nModern progressives advocate for strong environmental protections and measures to reduce or eliminate pollution. One reason for this is the strong link between economic injustice and adverse environmental conditions: groups that are economically marginalized tend to be disproportionately affected by the harms of pollution and environmental degradation.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of self-proclaimed progressives such as Bernie Sanders, Andrew Yang, and Elizabeth Warren, the term began to carry greater cultural currency, particularly in the 2016 Democratic primaries. While answering a question from CNN moderator Anderson Cooper regarding her willingness to shift positions during an October 2015 debate, Hillary Clinton referred to herself as a \"progressive who likes to get things done\", drawing the ire of a number of Sanders supporters and other critics from her left. Questions about the precise meaning of the term have persisted within the Democratic Party and without since the election of Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election, with some candidates using it to indicate their affiliation with the left flank of the party. As such, \"progressive\" and \"progressivism\" are essentially contested concepts, with different groups and individuals defining the terms in different (and sometimes contradictory) ways towards different (and sometimes contradictory) ends.\n\nFollowing the first progressive movement of the early 20th century, two later short-lived parties have also identified as \"progressive\".\n\nIn 1924, Wisconsin Senator Robert La Follette ran for president on the \"Progressive party\" ticket. La Follette won the support of labor unions, Germans and Socialists by his crusade. He carried only Wisconsin and the party vanished outside Wisconsin.\n\nThere, it remained a force until the 1940s.\n\nA third party was initiated in 1948 by former Vice President Henry A. Wallace as a vehicle for his campaign for president. He saw the two parties as reactionary and war-mongering, and attracted support from left-wing voters who opposed the Cold War policies that had become a national consensus. Most liberals, New Dealers, and especially the CIO unions, denounced the party because it was increasingly controlled by Communists. It faded away after winning 2% of the vote in 1948.\n\n\n"}

The classical prime number theorem serves as a prototypical example, and the emphasis is on abstract asymptotic distribution results. The theory was invented and developed by mathematicians such as John Knopfmacher and Arne Beurling in the twentieth century.\n\nThe fundamental notion involved is that of an arithmetic semigroup, which is a commutative monoid \"G\" satisfying the following properties:\n\n\n\nAn additive number system is an arithmetic semigroup in which the underlying monoid \"G\" is free abelian. The norm function may be written additively.\n\nIf the norm is integer-valued, we associate counting functions \"a\"(\"n\") and \"p\"(\"n\") with \"G\" where \"p\" counts the number of elements of \"P\" of norm \"n\", and \"a\" counts the number of elements of \"G\" of norm \"n\". We let \"A\"(\"x\") and \"P\"(\"x\") be the corresponding formal power series. We have the \"fundamental identity\"\n\nwhich formally encodes the unique expression of each element of \"G\" as a product of elements of \"P\". The \"radius of convergence\" of \"G\" is the radius of convergence of the power series \"A\"(\"x\").\n\nThe fundamental identity has the alternative form\n\n\n\n\nThe use of arithmetic functions and zeta functions is extensive. The idea is to extend the various arguments and techniques of arithmetic functions and zeta functions in classical analytic number theory to the context of an arbitrary arithmetic semigroup which may satisfy one or more additional axioms. Such a typical axiom is the following, usually called \"Axiom A\" in the literature:\n\n\nFor any arithmetic semigroup which satisfies Axiom \"A\", we have the following \"abstract prime number theorem\":\n\nwhere π(\"x\") = total number of elements \"p\" in \"P\" of norm |\"p\"| ≤ \"x\".\n\nThe notion of arithmetical formation provides a generalisation of the ideal class group in algebraic number theory and allows for abstract asymptotic distribution results under constraints. In the case of number fields, for example, this is Chebotarev's density theorem. An arithmetical formation is an arithmetic semigroup \"G\" with an equivalence relation ≡ such that the quotient \"G\"/≡ is a finite abelian group \"A\". This quotient is the \"class group\" of the formation and the equivalence classes are generalised arithmetic progressions or generalised ideal classes. If χ is a character of \"A\" then we can define a Dirichlet series\n\nwhich provides a notion of zeta function for arithmetical semigroup.\n\n\n"}

Longbridge is in close proximity to and can be viewed from the Lickey Hills.\n\nSince 1906, the area has been dominated by the Longbridge plant, which produced Austin, Nash Metropolitan, Morris, British Leyland, and most recently MG Rover cars. The factory became dormant, and some parts of the older sections of the site were demolished after MG Rover fell into administration in April 2005. The plant was one of the main employers of the local population and the resultant layoffs caused local decline. The company, renamed MG Motor (owned by MG Rover's would-be partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation) resumed full MG TF sports car production within a small portion of the factory in August 2008 and in late 2010 started final assembly of the MG6. The remaining disused sections of the factory were demolished on 4 August 2006.\n\nThe demolition of the Longbridge plant left behind a large amount of disused brownfield land. The site was bought by regeneration firm St. Modwen Properties. A shopping complex was constructed along with many new homes and a retirement complex. Concerns that the area's history would be completely erased were met with the addition of plaques set into the concrete walkway running parallel to the River Rea that give a brief history of the Longbridge Plant and its operators; principally, the Austin Motor Company. \n\nGary Sambrook of the Conservative Party is the Member of Parliament for Birmingham Northfield, representing the seat since December 2019.\n\nAs part of the Ward of Longbridge And West Heath, Longbridge is represented on Birmingham City Council by Debbie Clancy (Conservative Party (UK)) and Brett O'Reilly (Labour Party (UK)) who was very narrowly elected at the 2018 Birmingham City Council election.\n\nThe 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 30,964 people living in Longbridge with a population density of 3,789 people per km² compared with 3,649 people per km² for Birmingham. Longbridge has a small ethnic minority population: only 6.8% (2,117) of the ward's population consists of ethnic minorities, unlike more centralised areas such as Aston, Handsworth and Small Heath.\n\n\n\n"}

It is distributed throughout the Palearctic ecozone.\nThe common name of this species refers to the supposed shapes of the bold dark stigmata on the usually pale forewings. In this species all the stigmata have a rounded shape, contrasting with the elongated claviform stigmata of the much commoner heart and dart. The hindwings are grey, usually much darker than in heart and dart and turnip moth. The wingspan is 35–40 mm. The moth flies at night in June and July and is attracted to light and sugar.\n\nThe larva feeds on a variety of herbaceous plants (see list below). The young larva feeds on the leaves of the food plant, later feeding on the roots.

It is down the line from and is situated between to the south and to the north. Its three-letter station code is PEG. It is a small station with few services calling there.\n\nIt is managed by Northern Trains, which operates two southbound trains and one northbound train per day (excluding Sundays, when there is no service). Access to the platforms is via sloping tarmacadamed footpaths, and transfer between the northbound and southbound platforms is provided by the road overbridge at the north end of the station.\n\nThe station has featured in one of Bill Bryson's books – the author took the train to Pegswood before walking to Ashington.\n\nThe station was opened by the NER in 1903 (to serve the nearby village and colliery), more than 50 years after the line itself. The station was twice threatened with closure after nationalisation - firstly in 1958 and again in 1966 during the Beeching cuts, but was reprieved each time. Until 1968 it was served by through trains to , whilst a handful of through services (on average 3-4 each way per day) to and from Alnmouth, and Edinburgh Waverley continued to call right up until the late 1980s. However, the electrification of the line led to these being cut back to Berwick; they were further cut (and reduced in frequency to the present residual level) by British Rail in May 1991 due to a shortage of rolling stock. The local rail user group (SENRUG) has been running a campaign to improve service levels here and at neighbouring Widdrington since September 2016.\n\nOn Mondays to Saturdays a train starting at makes its way southbound through Northumberland providing a commuter service to . It calls at Pegswood at 07.52 and runs through to . This service is typically provided by a diesel multiple unit (DMU), normally a Class 156. There is a balancing northbound service between Newcastle and Chathill (departing Newcastle at 05:55) but it is limited stop and does not call here, Widdrington or Acklington.\n\nA second southbound train calls at 19.48 on weekdays or 20.03 on Saturdays – this service is the return working of the train which made its way northbound through the village earlier in the evening (see below). This continues beyond Newcastle through to .\n\nOn Mondays to Fridays a train from Newcastle at 17.56 (18:03 on Saturdays) reaches Pegswood at 18.21 (18:28 on Saturdays), having called at Manors, Cramlington, and Morpeth. From Pegswood, the local train continues to Widdrington, Acklington, Alnmouth, and Chathill. The train continues out of service to Belford, where it waits in a siding for other trains to pass, before returning to Chathill to form the southbound evening run through Northumberland. Like the morning run, this train is typically composed of a DMU.\n\nNo services call either way on Sundays.\n\nA bench and shelter are located on the southbound platform. Tickets are purchased on board the train. Owing to the cant of the track through the station, the step up into the train from the southbound platform is substantial. There are no facilities at all on the northbound platform other than a station name sign and a timetable poster board. A telephone kiosk, letter box, shop, and bus stop are all within a couple of minutes walk of the station. Step-free access is available to both platforms.\n"}

In spring 2013, Jeff hosted \"$24 in 24\", a show in which he went to several cities and ate an entire day's worth of meals on 24 dollars.\n\nSeason 8 started May 13, 2012. For season 8, the format changed, with the contestants divided into three five-member teams, each coached by a Food Network host, either Bobby Flay, Alton Brown, or Giada De Laurentiis. Coaches worked with the teams as they prepared for and completed their tasks. The winner's coach would also be the producer of the winner's show.\n\nEach week, a winning team was selected, and one member of the teams that did not win was up for elimination in a new feature called Producers' Challenge. Each challenge was hosted by current Food Network personalities.\n\nThe final winner was decided by an audience vote cast on foodnetwork.com between July 15–17, 2012 and the winner was announced on July 22, 2012. The winner was Justin Warner, who hosted a one-hour special on The Food Network, but did not have a series produced. He has become a blogger on foodnetwork.com, makes appearances at Food Network events, and is an active Twitter presence.\n\n\nSeason 9 started on June 2, 2013.

It is used so children develop a range of designing skills and technology skills for example, using media to design their project and a saw to cut items. It first appeared as a titled subject in the first National Curriculum of England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 1988. D&T, or a similar form, has been taught in many countries around the world such as India, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Malta, China, South Africa, France and Finland. Many international schools teach design and technology. As a school subject it involves students in designing in a practical context using a range or materials and media. It is also a university course in many countries, including Australia, Canada, the US, Singapore, South Africa, Netherlands and New Zealand, both for the preparation of teachers and for general education in areas such as industrial design. Some of the UK universities which deliver courses include: Brighton, Sheffield Hallam, Goldsmiths, University of London and Greenwich.\n\nWith the first National Curriculum new GCSE qualifications were introduced for D&T in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Unlike the National Curriculum the previous subject titles were retained (e.g. craft, design and technology (CDT) and home economics) and others added (e.g. electronics, food technology, textiles technology and systems and control). These GCSE specifications had two assessed components:\n\n\nGCSE D&T titles available included:\n\n\nSince September 2017 a new GCSE has been taught in England that incorporates all material areas (with the exception of food which is now a separate GCSE). Similar to the previous GCSE, the new GCSE Specifications have two assessed components - an exam and a non-examined assessment (NEA) but with a 50:50 split of the marks.\n\nA and AS level examinations prepare students for individualised learning and problem solving, which is essential in business and industry. Time management is a key factor to candidates' success within the coursework elements of the qualification. The examinations are as rigorous as any other subject. Indeed, due to the complexity and variety of tasks and organisation skills required this examination and course is very demanding. The subject covers activities from control technology to aesthetic product design. Students have to use all types of computer software including computer-aided design and manufacture, spreadsheets and computer presentations. Outputs from such work are often sent to CNC machines for manufacture.\n\nIB Design Technology (DT) is an elective subject offered in many International Baccalaureate schools globally. Design is also offered in the IB Middle Years Programme as a compulsory subject for grades 6–10, and at the Diploma Programme level (grades 11-12). IB Design Technology is very similar in content to \"Design Technology\", which is widely offered in the national curricula of England, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and many African nations. It is one of the Group 4 sciences.\n\nThe primary focus of MYP Design is to give students an understanding of the design cycle, through a practical programme. The student will complete projects based on solving a real and authentic problem. Students document their progress as they follow the design cycle to come to a feasible solution. They create the solution and then evaluate it following thorough testing.\n\nThe Diploma Programme of Design Technology is a two-year introduction to designing, a range of fundamentals of technology, and global technological issues. It provides students with the knowledge to be able to design and make in school workshops, and also to develop an informed literacy about technology in general. Because it is an international curriculum it has a particular focus on global environmental issues. It covers core topics in human factors and ergonomics, resource management and sustainable production, modeling, raw materials to final production, innovation and design, classic design. It covers advanced higher level topics in user centered design, sustainability, innovation and markets, and commercial production. The diploma is accepted for university entrance in many countries, and is a good preparation for careers in areas such as engineering, architecture, product design, interior design, design and education.\n\nTechnological education is part of the Scottish secondary school curriculum. Technological education is segregated into various subjects available at National 4, National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher\n\n\"Standard Subject in Technical\"\n\n\"Specialist Subjects within Technical\"\n\nExample work:\nwww.cdtwork.wordpress.com\n\nIn the UK, the Arkwright Scholarships Trust awards two-year scholarships to students who are taking GCSE/Scottish Standard Grade in design & technology. The Arkwright Engineering Scholarships support students through their A levels/Scottish Highers and encourage them to study engineering or a related area of design at a top university or through a high-quality industrial apprenticeship.\n\n"}

Founded in 1979 under the name Dalmatinski magazin (\"Dalmatian Magazine\" in Croatian), the band quickly began to make a mark on local pop music festivals with its songs influenced by Dalmatian folk music. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Andrea Šušnjara, guitarist Željko Baričić and bass guitarist Nenad Vesanović Keko. Baričić is the only active founding member even though Vesanović featured on every album to date.\n\nThe band is a successor to Mladi Batali band that was founded in 1966. Original name Dalmatinski Magazin was shortened to Magazin in 1982. after singer Majda Šoletić left the band.\nTheir gradual rise in popularity continued in the 1980s with a series of prestigious festival victories. But their zenith was reached while Ljiljana Nikolovska was the band's lead singer. The leader and songwriter Tonči Huljić began to insert elements of folk music of other European countries in his songs. Magazin became one of the most popular and most influential music bands in Croatia. Magazin have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide, which is the most for a Yugoslavian musical act. Their biggest hits are \"Put putujem\" (I'm travelling), \"Ti si želja mog života\" (You are the desire of my life), \"Sve bi me curice ljubile\" (All girls would kiss me), \"Balkanska ulica\" (Balkan street), \"Istambul\", \"Zna srce, zna\" (The heart knows, knows), \"Sve bi seke ljubile mornare\" (All girls would like to kiss sailors), \"Boli me\" (It hurts), \"Besane noći\" (Sleepless nights) and many more. Most of these songs are considered as classics in Croatia.\nThe band won the first iteration of Dora in 1992. with the song \"Aleluja\" but Croatia was not eligible to compete in the Eurovison Song Contest. Later, they entered the 1995 Eurovision Song Contest with \"Nostalgija\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2035853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035853", "title": "Aluminium sulfate", "text": "Aluminium sulfate\n\nAluminium sulfate is a chemical compound with the formula Al(SO). It is soluble in water and is mainly used as a coagulating agent (promoting particle collision by neutralizing charge) in the purification of drinking water and waste water treatment plants, and also in paper manufacturing.\n\nThe anhydrous form occurs naturally as a rare mineral millosevichite, found e.g. in volcanic environments and on burning coal-mining waste dumps. Aluminium sulfate is rarely, if ever, encountered as the anhydrous salt. It forms a number of different hydrates, of which the hexadecahydrate Al(SO)•16HO and octadecahydrate Al(SO)•18HO are the most common. The heptadecahydrate, whose formula can be written as [Al(HO)](SO)•5HO, occurs naturally as the mineral alunogen.\n\nAluminium sulfate is sometimes called alum or papermaker's alum in certain industries. However, the name \"alum\" is more commonly and properly used for any double sulfate salt with the generic formula , where \"X\" is a monovalent cation such as potassium or ammonium.\n\nAluminium sulfate may be made by adding aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH), to sulfuric acid, HSO:\n\nor by heating aluminum metal in a sulfuric acid solution:\n\nThe alum schists employed in the manufacture of aluminium sulfate are mixtures of iron pyrite, aluminium silicate and various bituminous substances, and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate, a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of aluminium sulfate of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until ferrous sulfate crystallizes on cooling; it is then drawn off and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, and decanted from any sediment.\n\nIn the preparation of aluminum sulfate from clays or from bauxite, the material is gently calcined, then mixed with sulfuric acid and water and heated gradually to boiling; if concentrated acid is used no external heat is generally required as the formation of aluminum sulfate is exothermic. it is allowed to stand for some time, the clear solution drawn off.\n\nWhen cryolite is used as the ore, it is mixed with calcium carbonate and heated. By this means, sodium aluminate is formed; it is then extracted with water and precipitated either by sodium bicarbonate or by passing a current of carbon dioxide through the solution. The precipitate is then dissolved in sulfuric acid.\n\nIt is sometimes used in the human food industry as a firming agent, where it takes on E number E520, and in animal feed as a bactericide. Aluminum sulfate may be used as a deodorant, an astringent, or as a stiptic for superficial shaving wounds.\n\nIt is a common vaccine adjuvant and works \"by facilitating the slow release of antigen from the vaccine depot formed at the site of inoculation.\"\n\nAluminium sulfate is used in water purification and as a mordant in dyeing and printing textiles. In water purification, it causes suspended impurities to coagulate into larger particles and then settle to the bottom of the container (or be filtered out) more easily. This process is called coagulation or flocculation. Research suggests that in Australia, aluminium sulfate used this way in drinking water treatment is the primary source of hydrogen sulfide gas in sanitary sewer systems. An improper and excess application incident in 1988 polluted the water supply of Camelford in Cornwall.\n\nWhen dissolved in a large amount of neutral or slightly alkaline water, aluminium sulfate produces a gelatinous precipitate of aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH). In dyeing and printing cloth, the gelatinous precipitate helps the dye adhere to the clothing fibers by rendering the pigment insoluble.\n\nAluminium sulfate is sometimes used to reduce the pH of garden soil, as it hydrolyzes to form the aluminium hydroxide precipitate and a dilute sulfuric acid solution. An example of what changing the pH level of soil can do to plants is visible when looking at \"Hydrangea macrophylla\". The gardener can add aluminium sulfate to the soil to reduce the pH which in turn will result in the flowers of the \"Hydrangea\" turning a different color (blue). The aluminium is what makes the flowers blue; at a higher pH, the aluminium is not available to the plant.\n\nIn the construction industry, it is used as waterproofing agent and accelerator in concrete. Another use is a foaming agent in fire fighting foam.\n\nIt can also be very effective as a molluscicide, killing spanish slugs.\n\nMordants aluminium triacetate and aluminium sulfacetate can be prepared from aluminium sulfate, the product formed being determined by the amount of lead(II) acetate used:\n\nThe compound decomposes to γ−alumina and sulfur trioxide when heated between 580 and 900 °C. It combines with water forming hydrated salts of various compositions.\n\nAluminium sulfate reacts with sodium bicarbonate to which foam stabilizer has been added, producing carbon dioxide for fire-extinguishing foams:\n\nThe carbon dioxide is trapped by the foam stabilizer and creates a thick foam which will float on top of hydrocarbon fuels and seal off access to atmospheric oxygen, smothering the fire. Chemical foam was unsuitable for use on polar solvents such as alcohol, as the fuel would mix with and break down the foam blanket. The carbon dioxide generated also served to propel the foam out of the container, be it a portable fire extinguisher or fixed installation using hoselines. Chemical foam is considered obsolete in the United States and has been replaced by synthetic mechanical foams, such as AFFF which have a longer shelf life, are more effective, and more versatile, although some countries such as Japan and India continue to use it.\n\n"}

The location of the battle was in a plain between the two towns of Skoutari and Parasyros. The battle ended in a Greek victory.\n\nFollowing the Venetian defeat to the Ottoman Empire in the Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718), the Peloponnese once again returned to Ottoman hands. However, the autonomous Mani, who had refused to accept Ottoman sovereignty in the first Ottoman occupation of the Peloponnese once again refused to accept Ottoman rule. The Maniots through an agent they had in Russia began conspiring with Catherine the Great and Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov. In 1770, terms were agreed and a Russian fleet sailed into the Aegean Sea and landing in Mani en route destroying an Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Chesma.\n\nAfter initial success, the Orlov Revolt ended in failure. Arguments between Orlov, the Russian leader, and John the Canine, the Maniot leader led to the separation of the armies. John's army suffered a devastating defeat at Rizomilo in Messenia against the Ottoman army with only John surviving. Meanwhile, the Russian army having made no long term gains retreated. The Ottomans had, meanwhile, unleashed mercenaries of Muslim Albanians (also known as Turkoalbanians) on Greece. They pillaged their way through Attica before attacking the Peloponnese where they massacred Greek civilians in revenge for massacres and destruction of properties that Christian forces committed against Muslim civilians.\n\nThey launched several incursions into Mani but they were all beaten back with heavy casualties. This string of defeat aggravated the Ottoman Pasha in the Peloponnese, Hatzi Osman and he mustered an army of 16,000 men and invaded Mani. He was held back for twelve days at Kastania but after capturing the towers he advanced down the coast to Skoutari, where he was once again delayed by a tower. This tower was garrisoned by fifteen men who held back the Ottoman army for three days until the tower as undermined and blown up.\n\nMeanwhile, a Maniot force consisting of 3,000 men and 2,000 women under the command of Exarchos Grigorakis and his nephew Zanetos Grigorakis had mustered in the hills above the town of Parasyros, which were known as Trikefali, and had fortified themselves. Hatzi, meanwhile, had advanced with his army to Agio Pigada (a plain that lay between Parasyros and Skoutari) and from there sent envoys demanding the surrender of the Maniots. However, the Maniots were hesitant in sending envoys back because if the answer was negative, Hatzi would have the envoys executed.\n\nThree old men, two priests and a layman volunteered and went to the Turkish camp. When they reached the camp, they went to the pasha and without bow they asked him what they wanted from the poor and free Maniots. The pasha demanded that the Maniots give \"...ten captains' children as hostages. All your guns and every year a poll tax for your head because you attacked against the Sultan with the Russians, our enemies\". The Maniot envoys replied: \"We prefer to die than give you our guns and freedom. We don't pay taxes because our land is poor\". Hatzi, infuriated by their answer, had them decapitated and mutilated before planting their heads on stakes.\n\nWhen the Maniots saw the fate of their envoys they decided how to defeat the Ottomans. During the night, a force of 1,500 Maniots outflanked the Ottoman positions and approached from the Turkish rear. Meanwhile, the main Maniot force attacked the Ottomans as they slept. The Ottomans, surprised by this night attack started to flee but were cut off by the Maniots at their rear. The remaining Turks managed to retreat to Mystras.\n\n"}
{"id": "2035871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035871", "title": "Fit-up", "text": "Fit-up\n\nFit-up refers to the old style of theatre or circus where companies of travelling players or performers would tour from town or village to village in the provinces of Britain and elsewhere, particularly throughout the 19th-century. Taken from the noun 'Fit-up', the term is theatre slang to describe a stage or tent or booth that can be transported and erected quickly for shows. A fit-up company would be a travelling company of players which carries its scenery, props and costumes that can be set up in a temporary venue - which might be a large tent or a village hall. 'Fit-up' companies were particularly prevalent in 19th-century Ireland and a study of the performance histories of these has been made by Irish academics. The oldest of these Irish companies included the J. B. Carrickford Company and Tommy Conway/Keegan, who formed the Bohemian Minstrels in the early 19th-century. \n\nThe number of 'fit-up companies' grew at the beginning of the 20th-century with estimates of about 60 companies touring the Irish countryside by 1930. Their performances usually involved some form of variety act and a melodrama followed by a farce. While World War I made times difficult for theatres in Ireland with conscription and travelling restictions making it difficult for overseas performers to get to venues, the fit-up companies were able to continue largely unaffected. The company of the actor Anew McMaster formed in 1925 continued this earlier tradition and travelled to the remote parts of Ireland to perform until the middle of the 20th-century. Examples in the 21st-century would include travelling circuses, travelling fairs and Punch and Judy shows.\n\nGenerally, a 'fit-up' company :\n\n...carried all their props, costumes, scenery, curtains and light system... and if necessary the materials for a temporary improvised stage which they would fit-up in whatever sort of venue was available.\nTheatrical companies would travel to often remote locations and ‘fit up’ the local theatres or halls. Very often these travelling shows might be the only entertainment a village might see for some time and would therefore usually play to capacity audiences. They would often perform the works of classic authors such as Shakespeare. In literature the novel \"Nicholas Nickleby\" (1838) by Charles Dickens includes the Crummles troupe of travelling players that Nickleby joins. Headed by Vincent Crummles, a larger-than-life actor-manager who takes Nicholas under his wing, he and his family take their act to America to pursue greater success on the theatrical stage.\n"}

Henry was heavily criticised following the All Blacks' quarterfinal exit at the 2007 Rugby World Cup and was controversially reappointed. He was vindicated, however, when the All Blacks won the 2011 Rugby World Cup final. and is one of the most successful coaches to have ever coached the All Blacks. On 1 November 2011, Henry announced he would be stepping down as All Blacks coach of 140 matches in a career that included a series victory over the tour British and Irish Lions in 2005, five Tri Nations and one Rugby World Cup title.\n\nIn 2012, Graham Henry joined Argentina as an advisor for the backroom coaching staff, and acted as an assistant coach to the Argentine Team. In 2013, he re-committed to Argentina for the 2013 Rugby Championship.\n\nAfter attending Christchurch Boys' High School where he was tutored in part by John Graham, Henry studied at the University of Otago, gained a Diploma in Physical Education in 1969, and became a secondary school geography and physical education teacher. He taught at two schools known for their rugby prowess – Auckland Grammar School and Kelston Boys' High School. He coached both their first XVs. He began his career at Grammar in 1973 and remained there – while completing a Bachelor of Education at Massey University in 1979 until 1982, when he was appointed deputy headmaster of Kelston. Following the unexpected death of head master Jim Paton while jogging in 1987, Henry became headmaster. He held the job until resigning to become a full-time coach in 1996.\n\nHis first major role was as coach of the successful Auckland provincial rugby team from 1992 to 1997. During his tenure, the team won the National Provincial Championship (NPC) four years in a row (1993–1996). Henry also coached the Blues in the Super 12 – winning the title in 1996 and 1997, and losing the final in 1998. Remarkably, the only other occasion the Blues have won the title was when he briefly returned as technical adviser in the 2003 season.\n\nAfter being overlooked for the All Blacks coaching position in 1998, Henry left New Zealand to coach Wales, at the time becoming the highest paid rugby union coach in the world for a reputed £250,000 per year. His success with Wales resulted in him being given the nickname \"the Great Redeemer\" in the media there after guiding his side to eleven consecutive victories in 1999. As a result, Henry gained celebrity status in Wales. He was appointed coach of the British and Irish Lions for their unsuccessful 2001 tour to Australia – this made him the first Lions' coach from outside the Home Nations. He left Wales in 2002 after a record defeat to Ireland in the Six Nations by 54–10, and returned to New Zealand where he was appointed defensive coach of the Blues during their successful 2003 Super 12 season.\n\n\nFollowing the All Blacks' semi-final loss to Australia in the 2003 Rugby World Cup the All Blacks coaching job was advertised. Apart from incumbent coach John Mitchell, Henry was the only applicant and took the job in December of that year. Henry appointed his former Wales assistant Steve Hansen as forwards coach, Wayne Smith as attack coach, and having himself responsible for defence. Henry also recruited Sir Brian Lochore as a selector. The coaching team was often referred to by rugby commentators as the Three Wise Men due to their collective experience and success.\n\nHis first Test match as coach was against the Rugby World Cup 2003 winners England team in New Zealand in 2004. England, coached by Sir Clive Woodward were decisively defeated in both Tests. The success did not carry on into the 2004 Tri-Nations where the All Blacks won two, and lost two Tests – they eventually finished last in the tournament. Henry and his assistants were criticised in the New Zealand media for their insistence on using a \"flat backline\" approach in attack – which they blamed for a low number of tries. The 2004 end of year Tests where they played Northern Hemisphere opponents was more successful and culminated in a 45–6 defeat of France in Paris.\n\nIn 2005 he coached the All Blacks in their 3–0 series defeat of the British and Irish Lions. He then coached the All Blacks to 2005 Tri-Nations victory where they lost their only match of 2005 – against South Africa. He then coached them to only their second ever Grand Slam over the four Home Nations later that year. The All Blacks were named 2005 IRB International Team of the Year by the sport's governing body, the International Rugby Board (IRB). The IRB named Henry as Coach of the Year and first five-eighth Dan Carter as Player of the Year.\n\nAfter winning the 2006 Tri-Nations and winning all end-of-year Tests in the tour of England, France and Wales, Henry won the IRB Coach of the Year again in 2006. The All Blacks were also named IRB International Team of the Year and captain Richie McCaw Player of the Year.\n\nDespite such successes, Henry attracted controversy for his rotation policy. This policy means that players in the squad are rotated into and out of the starting team resulting in consecutive matches in the All Blacks 2005 Grand Slam fielding entirely different starting fifteens. An extreme competitiveness developed for all positions.\n\nHenry's All Black coaching career was in question after New Zealand lost to France 20–18 in their 2007 World Cup quarter-final. This was New Zealand's worst-ever performance in a Rugby World Cup; they had made the last four of every previous tournament. In particular, Henry was blamed for instructing his men to press for a try in the final ten minutes of the game instead of attempting a drop goal, with the All Blacks losing by only two points; the All Blacks' best option for a drop goal, centre Aaron Mauger, never got onto the pitch. Others criticised Henry for omitting experienced winger Doug Howlett, the All Blacks' leading scorer of tries in this tournament, starting lock Keith Robinson (who was both injured and had had minimum game time throughout the World Cup) as well as the injured flyhalf Daniel Carter (after earlier proclaiming that his team had enough depth not to force any injured players onto the field), and playing Mils Muliaina, widely considered one of the best fullbacks in rugby, out of position at outside centre.\n\nHenry never stated that referee Wayne Barnes was culpable for the defeat, as Barnes not only allowed several French ruck infringements to go unpunished, but also sin-binned Luke McAlister and missed a forward pass in the buildup to the decisive French try scored by Yannick Jauzion. This later led to him receiving a fair sportsmans award, the second New Zealander after Tana Umaga. After some speculation that he would leave, Henry applied for the post after it became vacant, competing with Robbie Deans.\n\nOn 7 December 2007, Henry's contract as All Blacks coach was extended for a further two years, beating Crusaders's coach Robbie Deans, who subsequently accepted the head coaching position of the Australian rugby union team, the Wallabies. The reappointment produced a mixed reception with the public, media and past players; some applauded the decision while others considered it a mistake. The move to reappoint Henry was also significant as it was the first time that an All Black coach was reappointed after defeat in the World Cup. This has been very divisive in New Zealand with many commentators declaring that it was a case of politics at work.\n\nUpon his reappointment Henry stated that Richie McCaw would retain the captaincy of the All Blacks, and declared that he would be looking for new tight forwards for the All Blacks.\n\nIn July 2009, Henry was reappointed as the coach of the All Blacks through till the end of 2011. This contract saw him coaching the All Blacks through the 2011 Rugby World Cup which was held in New Zealand and won by the All Blacks beating France 8-7 in the final.\n\nDuring a series against France 2009 for contest of the Dave Gallagher Trophy he did not tell the All Blacks that they needed to win by a specified margin to secure the trophy. He said this was done because the All Blacks were \"relatively young\" and didn't need the extra pressure. This was not accepted as sound reasoning by all players.\n\nAt the IRB Awards in 2011, Henry and his team both captured awards. The All Blacks were named IRB International Team of the Year and Graham Henry IRB International Coach of the Year for the 5th time.\n\nOn 1 November 2011, Henry announced he would step down as coach, finishing his All Blacks career as one of the most successful rugby coaches of all time: he coached the All Blacks to 88 wins in 103 tests for a winning percentage of 85.4 percent. In February 2012, he took a two-year part-time position with the NZRU as a mentor for the country's Super Rugby and ITM Cup coaches. In April 2012, Henry began serving for one year in a similar role with the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR), primarily as a mentor to that country's high-level coaches and also as an assistant with the national team. His NZRU contract prohibits him from being part of the Pumas' coaching staff for their matches against New Zealand during the 2012 Rugby Championship, but the NZRU has given him its blessing to work with the UAR at other times.\n\nHenry met his wife Raewyn at university. She has also coached first class sports teams – the Auckland and Welsh netball teams. They have three children.\n\nHenry was made a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2012 New Year Honours, for services to rugby.\n\nFollowing the 2007 rugby world cup defeat, close friend Murray Deaker suggested Henry ought to step down as coach of the All Blacks. Deaker spells out his criticism in his recent book, \"Henry's All Blacks\". Deaker wrote the final chapter of the book, entitled The Verdict, after the loss to France at Cardiff: \"We choked,\" he has written. \"There's no other word for it – choked, choked, choked.\"\n\n\n"}

The city has an area of and a population of 324,756 (), and the Greater Posadas area has a population of over 359,609 according to a 2017 estimate ().\n\nPosadas is the provincial centre of the government, culture and the economy. Furniture, tobacco, food, textiles and construction are its most important industries. Other important economic activities are commerce and services.\n\nPosadas is connected to the Paraguayan city of Encarnación by the San Roque González de Santa Cruz Bridge. The port, once of great economical importance, is used for sport vessels, carrier of passengers and some boats for sand transport. The city is located on National Route 12, some from Buenos Aires. The General José de San Martín Airport , at coordinates , is seven kilometres from the city, and features regular flights to Buenos Aires.\n\nFather Roque González y de Santa Cruz established a town called Anunciación de Itapúa on March 25, 1615, but ten years later the settlement was moved to the other side of the Paraná River to the present location of Encarnación, Paraguay.\n\nThe first settlement was not completely abandoned, and a new San José reduction was settled there in 1628. In 1867, during the Paraguayan War, the Brazilians set up the Trinchera de San José military base there. Following the end of the war, Paraguay renounced all claims to the area, and in 1879, the town was renamed after Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, the Supreme Director of the Argentine Confederation (1814).\n\nOn December 22, 1881, the limits of the Misiones Federation were drawn, leaving Posadas within the territory of current Corrientes Province. On July 30, 1884 the National Congress decided to give Posadas to Misiones Province, and name it its capital. The National University of Misiones was established at Posadas in 1973, and in 1990, the city's cultural and economic links to Encarnación were strengthened with the completion of the San Roque González de Santa Cruz Bridge.\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Posadas, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 57 min. 10% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 16 min, while 26% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.3 km, while 2% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\nThe population mainly owns Spanish and indigenous ancestry (of the Avá ethnic group in its majority), generally resulting from the mixture of both parts and with that being the ethnic origin of the settlers who initially made up the city and also of the majority of those who arrived from the 20th century onwards from the rest of the province and especially from Paraguay (whith Paraguayans being the largest foreign group). Among those who migrated from the rest of Misiones there are also descendants of Germans (other people of that descent have migranted from southern Brazil in the first half of the 20th century), Poles and Ukrainians, as well as a small group of Mbyá indigenous people. Another little minorities are Romani, Ashkenazim and descendants of Italians and French, as well also immigrants from Colombia (who arrived since the late 2000s) and Asia (mainly Laotians of the Hmong ethnic group -who arrived in the late 1970s as refugees from the Laotian Civil War-, Japanese -who arrived in the mid-20th century- and Chinese -arrived from the 2000s-). Other immigrants who make up very small numbers and who generally arrived in the late-20th century or 21st century are Bolivians, Haitians (who are mainly university students), Peruvians, Senegalese, South Koreans and Taiwanese.\n\nPosadas has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa).

A bigger ship was designed, ironically about the same size as the older that the Royal Navy had rejected earlier as too large and expensive for mass production. The size of the new ship made them suitable for use as ocean-going escort ships and many were used in that role to fill a critical shortage of escorts. In fact most of the ships built for the RCN were solely employed as such and were fitted with more dedicated anti-submarine weapons than the RN ships. To maximise production, alternate designs were made to use either steam turbines or reciprocating steam engines.\n\nThe turbine-powered ships displaced at standard load and at deep load while the reciprocating group displaced at standard load and at deep load. The hull's dimensions were the same for both groups and the ship measured long overall with a beam of . The turbine group had a draught of while the reciprocating ships sat deeper in the water. The ships' complement consisted of 85 officers and ratings.\n\nThe turbine-powered ships had two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The reciprocating ships had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines totalling and reached the same speed.

The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Many Canadian ships omitted their sweeping gear in exchange for a 24-barrel Hedgehog spigot mortar and a stowage capacity for 90+ depth charges.\n\nAfter the war, a number continued in service as patrol boats, survey ships, and training ships. On 11 March 1959 HMS \"Acute\" and HMS \"Jewel\", training ships at Dartmouth, rescued the burning German coaster \"Vorman Rass\", off Start Point, Devon. Some were sold to other navies or into merchant service. At least one, HMS \"Pickle\" was still engaged in minesweeping duties in British waters as late as 1955. At least one \"Algerine\" is still in service with the Royal Thai Navy: HTMS \"Phosampton\" (ex-).\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father, Vítor Cândido Gonçalves, was an amateur footballer turned foreign exchange dealer. He graduated from the Portuguese military academy as an engineer in 1942. Gonçalves married, in 1950, Aida Rocha Afonso, with whom he had a son, Vitor, and a daughter, Maria João.\n\nIn 1942, Gonçalves graduated from a Portuguese military academy in the Army Engineering Corps. As an officer, Gonçalves served in Portuguese Goa, and spent part of his military career in the Portuguese overseas territories of Angola and Mozambique.\n\nIn 1973, Gonçalves joined the Armed Forces Movement and was involved in the planning of the overthrow of the Estado Novo regime.\n\nGonçalves's tenure as Prime Minister of Portugal was marked by political turmoil and instability. The PM oversaw the transition of the Portugal into a democracy known as the Processo Revolucionário Em Curso or the \"Ongoing Revolutionary Process\".\n\nEarly in March 1975, Gonçalves's leadership was challenged by a right-wing coup attempt which ultimately failed. Emboldened by this, the Prime Minister proceeded to nationalize all Portuguese-owned capital in the banking, insurance, petrochemical, fertilizer, tobacco, cement, and wood pulp sectors of the economy, as well as the Portuguese iron and steel company, major breweries, large shipping lines, most public transport, two of the three principal shipyards, core companies of the Companhia União Fabril (CUF) conglomerate, radio and TV networks (except that of the Roman Catholic Church), and important companies in the glass, mining, fishing, and agricultural sectors.\nIn April 1975, the Socialist Party and its allies gained a majority in the provisional constituent assembly; they quickly denounced Gonçalves, whom they accused of left-wing extremism, and they began a series of campaigns of civil disobedience against Gonçalves' government. On August 18, Gonçalves delivered an impassioned speech decrying his political opponents. The tone of this speech raised doubts about his sanity and two weeks later, amid a growing threat of civil war, President Francisco da Costa Gomes dismissed Gonçalves.\n\nGonçalves' dismissal was met with heavy opposition from the radical Portuguese left, most notably from the Portuguese Workers' Communist Party, which organized mass demonstrations in Lisbon in September 1975.\n\nAfter his tenure as Prime Minister, Gonçalves retired from politics and would occasionally attend rallies in support of movements from the left. His last public appearance was in 2004 at an event with Portuguese Prime Minister José Manuel Durão Barroso.\n\nWhile remaining independent throughout his life, Gonçalves identified as a Marxist.\n\nVasco dos Santos Gonçalves died on June 11, 2005 at the age of 84 after drowning in his brother's swimming pool due to cardiac complications.\n"}

Designed for shunting in docks, it had a short wheelbase in order for it to readily negotiate tight curves. The locomotives spent their entire lives painted in plain black.\n\nThe LMS were responsible for operating lines on a number of docks which, due to space constraints, contained curves considerably sharper than most other places, thus most dock tanks had only four coupled (i.e. driving) wheels in order to allow them to negotiate the tight curves.\n\nWith the growth in freight a more powerful engine was required which resulted in this design by Sir Henry Fowler for an 0-6-0 tank locomotive with a wheelbase which, aided by the use of Cartazzi self-centring axleboxes on the rear axle, allowed the loco to negotiate curves of 2½ chains.\n\nTen of these simple sturdy locomotives were built on Lot 61 in 1928 and 1929 by Derby Works although, unusually for dock tanks they incorporated outside cylinders, these normally being considered too dangerous in an area where people were working close to the rapidly moving rods. Other than this they were typical of most dock tanks with simple slide valves and oval buffers.\n\nThey were initially numbered 11270–11279, renumbered under the LMS 1933 renumbering scheme to 7100–7109, and renumbered again in 1939 to 7160–7169. Despite their small number, the LMS considered them standard locomotives. After nationalisation in 1948, BR added 40000 to their numbers making them 47160–47169, and allocated 5 of the 10 to Scottish depots, where they operated on branch lines as well as docks.\n\nWithdrawals took place between 1959 and 1964 with none surviving into preservation.\n"}

Saladins were noted for their excellent performance in desert conditions, and found favour with a number of Middle Eastern armies accordingly. They were armed with a 76 mm low-pressure rifled (spin-stabilised) gun which fired the same ammunition as that mounted on the FV101 Scorpion.\n\nThe Saladin also spawned an armoured personnel carrier counterpart, the Alvis Saracen.\n\nDespite the vehicle's age and dated design, it is still in use in a number of countries in secondary roles.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War, the British Army issued a requirement for a new, 6×6 wheeled armoured vehicle to replace the obsolete AEC Armoured Car. Design work began in 1947 and a contract was awarded to Alvis Cars to build two prototypes for trials. The new armoured car was designated FV601A and armed with an Ordnance QF 2-pounder gun. Alvis also proposed a much heavier fire support variant designated FV601B armed with a new 76 mm low-pressure gun. Design work on the FV601B was subcontracted to Crossley Motors, which engineered and manufactured six pre-production models. After further modifications by Alvis, the FV601C entered mass production in 1958 as the \"Alvis Saladin\". Production of the FV601C and its variants continued at the Alvis factory at Coventry until 1972.\n\nA special variant known as the FV601D was developed for law enforcement agencies and internal security purposes; this model lacked a co-axial machine gun and had different lights and smoke dischargers. The FV601D was only adopted by the German Federal \"Bundesgrenzschutz\", which designated it \"Geschützter Sonderwagen III\". A Saladin was also offered with the same 30 mm RARDEN autocannon as found on the FV510 Warrior and FV721 Fox, but this model did not find favour with the British military or any export customers.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany was the first country to express an interest in the Saladin, specifically the FV601D. When production began, export customers such as Australia, Indonesia, and Ghana also placed large orders for the vehicle. By the late 1960s, the British Army was beginning to dispose of second-hand Saladins as military aid for various Commonwealth member states. The Saladin performed well on the export market but was not as successful as its primary competitor, the French Panhard AML-90, which was much more heavily armed, and cheaper.\n\nThe Saladin shared many common components with the Saracen armoured personnel carrier, Stalwart high mobility load carrier and Salamander fire tender.\n\nThe Saladin was used by B Sqn 16/5 Lancers during their defence of Nicosia airport in 1974 and subsequent armed recce operations under the banner of the UN.\n\nThe Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) modified Saladin turrets, and fitted them onto M113A1 tracked personnel carriers; this combination was known as the Fire Support Vehicle (FSV). However, the same name was also used for a subsequent vehicle, based on the turret from the FV101 Scorpion (and accepted by the RAAC in 1976). This was later redesignated the Medium Reconnaissance Vehicle (MRV).\n\nThe Saladin was widely used by the Sultan of Oman's armed forces throughout the Omani Civil War, and saw extensive action during the period 1972 to 1976, supporting ground forces and on convoy patrol. Often crewed by British servicemen (loan soldiers) and Omani servicemen, the Sultan's Armoured Car Squadron consisted of an estimated 36 Saladins. They saw extensive action supporting troops from the British SAS, Oman Firqa, Oman regulars, and Iranian forces in their war with the Adoo. The squadron's vehicles were regularly attacked by Katyusha rockets, anti-tank mines, rocket propelled grenades, and light and heavy machine gun fire. Many vehicles were mined and repaired, and after the end of the war in 1976 the Saladin remained in service until the early 1980s. An unpublished account called \"The Tinned Equivalent\" was written in 1977, and details many of the events of that war.\n\nThe Ceylon Army received several ex-British Army Saladins following the outbreak of the 1971 JVP insurrection and were deployed counter-insurgency operations. These were used extensively by the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps in the 1980s in the early stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War, with its 76 mm gun being effective in countering insurgents. However, the wheeled vehicles had limited cross country capabilities and suffered damage from IEDs and RPGs in urban areas. In one case, in July 1987 during an insurgent attack on an army encampment in Jaffna, a Saladin was knocked out when an RPG entered through the drivers viewing portal, killing the driver and a sergeant inside. Saladins remained in reserve status till the end of the war in 2009. It forms the tank crew pin of the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps.\n\nDuring the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Saladins were filmed on the streets of Kuwait City defending Kuwait against Iraqi forces.\n\nThe Indonesian Army (TNI AD) uses the Saladin for \"KOSTRAD Cavalry Battalion\", \"KOSTRAD Recon Company\" and Armoured Car Company. In 2014, the Indonesian Army confirmed that it was continuing to deploy the Saladin in active operations. Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla charged state-owned arms manufacturer Pindad with developing a modernization package for the Saladin in early 2016, indicating the armoured car would continue to remain in service for some time. By the end of the year 16 Indonesian Army Saladins had been modernized by Pindad.\n\nThe Sudanese Army deployed Saladins during the Second Sudanese Civil War, some being captured by the SPLA.\n\nNearly 100 Saladins were exported to the Federal Republic of Germany as part of a British assistance programme for the fledgling \"Bundesgrenzschutz\" in the mid to late 1950s. In German service they were designated \"Geschützer Sonderwagen III\" and utilised for border patrols. All but 25, along with the entire German inventory of spare parts, were later resold to Honduras as part of a $7 million deal negotiated through Honduran defence contractor Gerard Latchinian. Honduran Saladins could be seen in the streets of Tegucigalpa in the 2009 coup against President Manuel Zelaya.\n\n\n\nThere is a Saladin on display as a gate guard at Episkopi Garrison, British Sovereign Base, Cyprus. It is dedicated to the memory of L/Cpl Nicholas Stokes, who died in a training accident in October 1992.\n\nA decommissioned Lebanese Army Saladin is currently part of the \"Hope for Peace\" monument in Yarze, Lebanon.\n\nThere is an FV 601 Saladin in Yad la-Shiryon museum, Latrun.\n\nThere is an Alvis Saladin at Sri Lanka Armoured Corps Training Centre, Anuradhapura – a gate guard.\n\nSeveral Saladins are parked at a tank garage at The Indonesian Army 4th Cavalry Battalion.\n\nThere are three surviving Saladins in The Tank Museum, Dorset, England. One, in all over green, is displayed in the tank story exhibition. The second, in all over tan, is in operational condition and used in events. The third, in a tan and green camouflage pattern, is part of the museum's reserve collection and is stored in the vehicle conservation centre.\n\nThere is a Saladin in the Muckleburgh Collection, Norfolk, England. It can be seen running at various time during the year.\n\nThere is a Saladin on display at the Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry Museum at Hever Castle in Kent.\n\nThere is a Saladin at the Dunmore Park base of the B Squadron \"North Irish Horse\" SNIY Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, an Army Reserve regiment.\n\nThere is a Saladin at the Aldershot Army Museum\n\nThere is also a non-functioning Alvis Saladin displayed outside the Lebanese Army's military outpost in the mountain region of Baabda located between Hammana and Chbaniyeh.\n\nAn American college sports enthusiasts club in Knoxville, Tennessee, the \"Big Orange Army\" operates a Saladin painted orange as an advertising device.\n\nThere is another privately owned and fully operational restored 1959 Saladin AFV in Knoxville Tennessee. It has a live L5A1 76 mm main gun and a coaxial 1919A4 BMG with a Browning M2 Machine Gun top mounted on authentic US Mark 93 mounting hardware and gun shield plate.\n\nThere is a privately owned Saladin in the Hurst-Euless-Bedford area of Texas.\n\nThere is a Saladin as gate guardian at King Phraya Damrong Rajanupam Camp of the Royal Thai Border Police in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand.\n\nThere is a privately owned Saladin in the Vancouver, British Columbia area of Canada.\n\nThere is a Saladin at the Inniskillings Museum in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.\n\nNumerous Saladin survive in Australia, one example is on display at the RAAC Memorial and Tank Museum Puckapunyal, Victoria. and another complete operational, privately owned ex-British Saladin exists in the outer metropolitan region of Sydney. Many ex-Australian Army Saladins remain turretless because of the fitting of Saladin turrets on M113 carriers to make the Fire Support Vehicle (M113-A1 FSV) used in the Vietnam war.\nTwo Saladins are on display at the Australian Armour and Artillery Museum located in Cairns, Queensland. One as the Gate Guard and the second (on display) is in running condition.\n\n"}
{"id": "2035956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035956", "title": "Waterfalls (TLC song)", "text": "Waterfalls (TLC song)\n\n\"Waterfalls\" is a song by American recording group TLC. It was written by band member Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes with Marqueze Etheridge and Organized Noize for TLC's second album, \"CrazySexyCool\" (1994), featuring production by the latter. The song was released as the third single from the album on May 29, 1995 in the United States, followed by a United Kingdom release on August 5, 1995.\n\nOften considered the group's signature song, \"Waterfalls\" was an international hit, topping the charts in many different territories. The song spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, giving the group their second US No. 1. The song was the No. 2 song of the year on the \"Billboard\" 1995 year-end chart. \"Waterfalls\" also peaked at No. 1 in New Zealand and Switzerland while reaching the top ten in many other countries. \"Waterfalls\" received critical acclaim, earning two Grammy nominations at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in 1996 for Record of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n\nThe song tackled issues of the illegal drug trade, promiscuity and HIV/AIDS. Jarett E. Nolan of BMG noted that \"Waterfalls\" was the first number one song ever to reference AIDS in one of its verses. The accompanying music video for the song reflected its socially conscious lyrics. With a million-dollar budget, the video was an MTV staple credited for giving the single much of its success. It stayed atop the MTV Video Monitor chart for over a month, making TLC the first act to ever achieve this feat. The video won four MTV Video Music Awards in 1995, including top honors for Video of the Year. TLC was the first African-American act to ever receive the trophy.\n\n\"Waterfalls\" is an R&B song, written by TLC band member Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes with Marqueze Etheridge and Organized Noize, who also produced the song. Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas and Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins perform the song with Lopes, who also provides a rap. The background vocals are performed by the members of TLC, as well as Debra Killings and Cee-Lo Green. Of Green's involvement, Watkins noted, \"He was in Goodie Mob, we grew up together, we go way back. He (sang on the track) and it was amazing! I love his voice.\"\n\nThe lyrics of the song reference 1990s issues such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic and violence associated with the illegal drug trade. Watkins said that it was important for the group to \"get the message across without seeming like preaching.\"\n\nThe TLC song shares elements with Paul McCartney's song of the same name, which opens with the line \"Don't go jumping waterfalls, please keep to the lake.\" McCartney himself noted the resemblance, stating \"In fact, somebody had a hit, a few years ago, using the first line...then they go off into another song. It's like, 'Excuse me?'\"\n\nThe music video was directed by F. Gary Gray and features Ella Joyce, Bokeem Woodbine, Shyheim, Paul J. Alessi and Gabrielle Bramford. TLC had to force L.A. Reid to get the budget for the music video, which was filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood from June 8–9, 1995.\n\nLike the song itself, the video tackles issues of illegal drug trade and HIV/AIDS, two crises that plagued the 1990s. A young man (Shyheim) goes against his mother's advice to stop selling drugs, and is killed before a drug deal. In other scenes, a woman in a relationship is shown convincing her partner (Alessi) not to use a condom. Afterwards, he looks in the mirror and sees that he has an early symptom of AIDS visible on his face, in the form of Kaposi's sarcoma. He then sees a small photo frame on the dresser, showing all the people she has had sex with previously. The video also intercuts scenes of liquefied versions of TLC performing to the song while standing on top of an ocean and performing in front of a real waterfall. At the end of the video, the young man involved with drug gangs appears in ghost form. He tries to hug his mother as she is walking down the streets; every time he tries to hug her, she walks right through him. The bedroom of the couple shows the man's face faded from the picture with the woman sitting alone on the bed; she too fades away, as they both die from AIDS.\n\nThe video won four awards at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards: Video of the Year, Best Group Video, Best R&B Video, and the Viewer's Choice Award. Watkins stated in retrospect that the \"video spoke for a whole epidemic.\"\n\nThe song was performed at many awards shows, including the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards and the 1996 Grammy Awards. The group performed \"Waterfalls\" at the 1995 MTV Movie Awards wearing black tops and silver pants. The performance \"was theatrical and kept true to the lyrical story.\" They also performed the song at MTV's 20th Anniversary on August 1, 2001, making it Left Eye's final performance with the group before her death. In September 1995, TLC performed \"Waterfalls\" in a medley with \"Creep\" and \"Diggin' on You\" on the British TV chart show \"Top of the Pops\", aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom.\n\nRemaining members T-Boz and Chilli performed the song along with Alicia Keys and fellow girl groups En Vogue and SWV at the 2008 BET Awards. Thomas and Watkins appeared on Good Morning America on October 15, 2013 to perform the song during promotion for the greatest hits \"20\" and the VH1 biopic \"\".\n\nOn November 24, 2013, TLC performed at the 2013 American Music Awards with special guest Lil Mama, who performed Left Eye's rap in tribute to her.\n\n\"Waterfalls\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Bill Lamb from About.com commented that \"slinky, gently insistent backing horns and guitar combine with smooth, languid vocals to create an instant R&B classic.\" He noted that the song \"is a disturbing commentary on street violence and its impact on the lives of young black men.\" Christine Werthman from \"Complex\" wrote that the song \"is drenched in water-droplet synth notes, live drums, rising horns, and a bass line that walks wherever it pleases.\" She noted that \"it's a heavy song, but the warnings in the verses are buoyed by a rich, singable chorus, which certainly helped it get radio play.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" described it as a \"Prince-inspired ballad\" that \"hint[s] at the artistic greatness TLC might achieve if freed from commercial concerns.\" Nigel Butler of Sputnikmusic compared the song to esteemed artists such as Sly and the Family Stone, Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder. Butler wrote, \"The arrangement and instrumentation is absolutely fantastic - if a bunch of great melodies had an orgy, the result would something a little like this - and the lyrics are the best on an album that maintains a shockingly high standard of songwriting. Left-Eye drops the album's best rap on this track too.\"\n\nThe song was nominated for two Grammys at the 1996 Grammy Awards: Record of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. It was also ranked 13th in VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years and 8th on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 1990s. In 2010, \"Billboard\" awarded the song the top position of summer songs in 1995.\n\n\"Billboard\" named the song #10 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.\n\nJeff Benjamin of Fuse wrote that the track was \"far more than just another pop hit: The track told a cautionary tale of HIV and AIDS, and its video depicted a man who didn't wear a condom with his girlfriend and later watched his body degenerate in the mirror.\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \"Waterfalls, \"with its gently insistent horns and guitar lines and instantly memorable chorus, ... ranks as one of the classic R&B songs of the '90s.\" Sputnikmusic's Butler asserted that \"any list of the best singles of the 90s that does not include this in the top 15 — at least — is among the worst lists ever written.\" Australian music channel Max placed the song at number 196 in their list of \"1000 Greatest Songs of All Time\" in 2012.\n\nThomas and Watkins rerecorded \"Waterfalls\" with Japanese pop and R&B singer Namie Amuro in 2013 for the song's twentieth anniversary. The song peaked at number twelve on Japan's Hot 100 chart. That same year, the song was referenced in the film \"We're the Millers\" as Will Poulter performs Lopes's rap. The song also appears in the film's end credits. In 2015, the horror-comedy show \"Scream Queens\" featured the song in the pilot and is referenced numerous times in other episodes. It appears in the 2019 Marvel Studios film \"Captain Marvel\", which is set in 1995.\n\nUS/International CD single\n\nEuropean CD Single\n\n2001 US re-release CD single\n\nWaterfalls (20th Anniversary Edition) Digital Single\n\n\"Waterfalls\" was recorded by British girl group Stooshe originally recorded for their self-titled debut album, released through Warner Music UK on November 11, 2012. Stooshe chose to release a cover of \"Waterfalls\" after meeting TLC member T-Boz, who had previously congratulated them on their acoustic cover of the song. The band have turned the track's rap, performed by Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, into a three-part harmony. It was announced in April 2013 that the group's cover of \"Waterfalls\" would not be appearing on their debut album, with member Karis Anderson claiming they \"are pretending [it] didn't happen\".\n\n4Music's Trent Maynard stated that Stooshe's take on \"Waterfalls\" has \"smooth, layered harmonies and a easy-breezy barbershop feel.\" Digital Spy's Lewis Corner gave the song three out of five stars and commented \"It must be said that soft flourishes of brass and light guitar strums blend with the girls' on-point vocals smoother than a Starbucks cappuccino. However, after proving themselves as one of 2012's most promising original pop acts, covering a much-loved '90s anthem still feels like a strange move.\" Jon Hornbuckle from \"So So Gay\" gave the song four stars and stated \"Covering a song as famous as TLC's global hit 'Waterfalls' could backfire on a girl group, but Stooshe shouldn't be worried. Their take on the classic 1995 hit is yet another opportunity for them to showcase their fantastic voices and is a sure-fire hit, with its radio friendly vibes and sing-along chorus.\" He thought the song sounded \"fresh\" and Stooshe had managed to put their own stamp on the track. Hornbuckle added \"If only all cover tracks were like this – a re-interpretation, rather than a copy-and-paste cover.\"\n\nStooshe released an official lyric video for the track on October 3, before unveiling the official music video on T4 on October 7. The video, directed by Matt Stawski, features cameo appearances from fellow TLC members T-Boz and Chilli. Hornbuckle commented \"The video is perhaps the most colourful promo from a girl group for years, and we love the choreography the girls pull out on the chorus. Stooshe make being cool, classy and fun all at once look effortless.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2035975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035975", "title": "Radical Reformation", "text": "Radical Reformation\n\nThe Radical Reformation represented a response to perceived corruption both in the Catholic Church and in the expanding Magisterial Protestant movement led by Martin Luther and many others. Beginning in Germany and Switzerland in the 16th century, the Radical Reformation gave birth to many radical Protestant groups throughout Europe. The term covers radical reformers like Thomas Müntzer (circa 1489–1525) and Andreas Karlstadt (1486–1541), the Zwickau prophets (1521–1522), and Anabaptist groups like the Hutterites (founded circa 1527) and the Mennonites (founded circa 1536).\n\nIn parts of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, a majority sympathized with the Radical Reformation despite intense persecution. Although the surviving proportion of the European population that rebelled against Catholic, Lutheran and Zwinglian churches was small, Radical Reformers wrote profusely and the literature on the Radical Reformation is disproportionately large, partly as a result of the proliferation of the Radical Reformation teachings in the United States.\n\nUnlike the Catholics and the more Magisterial Lutheran and Reformed (Zwinglian and Calvinist) Protestant movements, some of the Radical Reformation abandoned the idea that the \"Church visible\" was distinct from the \"Church invisible.\" Thus, the Church only consisted of the tiny community of believers, who accepted Jesus Christ and demonstrated this by adult baptism, called \"believer's baptism\".\n\nWhile the magisterial reformers wanted to substitute their own learned elite for the learned elite of the Catholic Church, the radical Protestant groups rejected the authority of the institutional \"church\" organization, almost entirely, as being unbiblical. As the search for original Christianity was carried further, it was claimed that the tension between the church and the Roman Empire in the first centuries of Christianity was normative, that the church is not to be allied with government sacralism, that a true church is always subject to be persecuted, and that the conversion of Constantine I was, therefore, the Great Apostasy that marked a deviation from pure Christianity.\n\nThough most of the Radical Reformers were Anabaptist, some did not identify themselves with the mainstream Anabaptist tradition. Thomas Müntzer was involved in the German Peasants' War. Andreas Karlstadt disagreed theologically with Huldrych Zwingli and Martin Luther, teaching nonviolence and refusing to baptize infants while not rebaptizing adult believers. Kaspar Schwenkfeld and Sebastian Franck were influenced by German mysticism and spiritualism.\n\nSome early forms of the Radical Reformation were millenarian, focusing on the imminent end of the world. This was particularly notable in the rule of John of Leiden over the city of Münster in 1535, which was ultimately crushed by the combined forces of the Catholic Bishop of Münster and the Lutheran Landgrave of Hesse. After the Munster rebellion, the small group of the Batenburgers continued to adhere to militant Anabaptist beliefs. Non-violent Anabaptist groups also had millenarian beliefs.\n\nThe early Anabaptists believed that their reformation must purify not only theology but also the actual lives of Christians, especially their political and social relationships. Therefore, the church should not be supported by the state, neither by tithes and taxes, nor by the use of the sword; Christianity was a matter of individual conviction, which could not be forced on anyone, but rather required a personal decision for it.\n\nMany groups were influenced by biblicism (like the Swiss Brethren), spiritualism (like the South German Anabaptists) and mainly absolute pacifism (like the Swiss Brethren, the Hutterites and the Mennonites from Northern Germany and the Netherlands). The Hutterites also practiced community of goods. In the beginning, most of them were strongly missionary.\n\nLater forms of Anabaptism were much smaller and focused on the formation of small, separatist communities. Among the many varieties to develop were Mennonites, Amish, and Hutterites. Typical among the new leaders of the later Anabaptist movement, and certainly the most influential of them, was Menno Simons (1496–1561), a Dutch Catholic priest who early in 1536 decided to join the Anabaptists.\n\nSimons had no use for the violence advocated and practiced by the Münster movement, which seemed to him to pervert the very heart of Christianity. Thus, Mennonite pacifism is not merely a peripheral characteristic of the movement, but rather belongs to the very essence of Menno's understanding of the gospel; this is one of the reasons that it has been a constant characteristic of all Mennonite bodies through the centuries.\n\nThe Anabaptists of the Radical Reformation continue to inspire current community groups such as the Bruderhof and movements such as Urban Expression in the UK.\n\nIn addition to the Anabaptists, other Radical Reformation movements have been identified. Notably, George Huntston Williams, the great categorizer of the Radical Reformation, considered early forms of Unitarianism (such as that of the Socinians, and exemplified by Michael Servetus as well as the Polish Brethren), and other trends that disregarded the Nicene christology still accepted by most Christians, as part of the Radical Reformation. With Michael Servetus (1511–1553) and Faustus Socinus (1539–1604) anti-Trinitarianism came to the foreground.\n\n\n\n"}

Robin, an approximate formula for the capacity of a sealed expanded bag is:\n\nwhere \"w\" is the width of the bag (the shorter dimension), \"h\" is the height (the longer dimension), and \"V\" is the maximum volume. The approximation ignores the crimping round the equator of the bag.\n\nA very rough approximation to the capacity of a bag that is open at one edge is:\n\n(This latter formula assumes that the corners at the bottom of the bag are linked by a single edge, and that the base of the bag is not a more complex shape such as a lens).\n\nIn the special case where the bag is sealed on all edges and is square with unit sides, \"h\" = \"w\" = 1, and so the first formula estimates a volume for this of roughly:\n\nor roughly 0.19. According to Andrew Kepert at the University of Newcastle, Australia, an upper bound for this version of the teabag problem is 0.217+, and he has made a construction that appears to give a volume of 0.2055+.\n\nIn the article referred to above A C Robin also found a more complicated formula for the general paper bag. Whilst this is beyond the scope of a general work, it is of interest to note that for the tea bag case this formula gives 0.2017, unfortunately not within the bounds given by Kepert (i.e., 0.2055+ ≤ maximum volume ≤ 0.217+).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2035990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035990", "title": "Herbie", "text": "Herbie\n\nHerbie (sometimes referred to as \"Herbie the Love Bug\") is a fictional sentient anthropomorphic 1963 Volkswagen Beetle, a character that is featured in several Walt Disney motion pictures starting with the 1968 feature film \"The Love Bug\". He has a mind of his own and is capable of driving himself, and is often a serious contender in auto racing competitions. Throughout most of the franchise, Herbie is distinguished by red, white and blue racing stripes from front to back bumper, a racing-style number 53 on the front luggage compartment lid, doors, and engine lid, and a yellow-on-black '63 California license plate with the registration \"OFP 857\".\n\nHerbie's origins as a racing car are firmly established in \"The Love Bug\" (1968). Before the events of the film, he was bought from the showroom of Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson) by San Francisco socialite Mrs. Van Luit for her upstairs maid, but returned him shortly afterwards due to reliability problems. He was then purchased by race driver Jim Douglas (Dean Jones), who had earlier stood up for Herbie when Thorndyke kicked him. Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett), Jim's best friend and housemate, names the car \"Herbie\" after his uncle Herb, a middleweight boxer whose nose got shaped more and more like a Volkswagen Beetle, then makes Herbie a racing car.\n\nIn \"Herbie Rides Again\" (1974), Herbie has been left to Tennessee's widowed aunt, Mrs. Steinmetz (Helen Hayes). Mrs. Steinmetz and her displaced neighbor, Nicole Harris (Stefanie Powers), try to save her house from being bulldozed by Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) with the help of Herbie. During the film, it is explained that after several successful races with Herbie, Douglas entered foreign racing circuits while his sidekick Tennessee is residing in Tibet to help his ailing instructor. During the film, it is revealed that Herbie has befriended other sentient VW Beetles and these team up with him to defeat Hawk, and we learn of the existence of other sentient objects (briefly mentioned by Tennessee in the first film), such as Mrs. Steinmetz's self-playing jukebox.\n\nBy \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\" (1977), Douglas enters Herbie in the Trans-France Race and recruits mechanic friend Wheely Applegate (Don Knotts) to assist him. Herbie falls in love with a Lancia Scorpion named Giselle (who is also sentient, although Jim, Herbie and Wheely are the first to discover it) and Douglas with her driver Diane Darcy (Julie Sommars). Herbie also finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when the stolen \"Etoile de Joie\" diamond is hidden in his gas tank.\n\nIn \"Herbie Goes Bananas\" (1980), Douglas has retired from racing after Monte Carlo and leaves Herbie to his nephew, Pete Stancheck (Stephen W. Burns), who plans to enter Herbie in the Brazil Grand Primeo. In the interim, Herbie befriends an orphan named Paco (Joaquin Garay, III), with whom he wreaks havoc on board the cruise ship the \"Sun Princess\", prompting the overzealous Captain Blythe (Harvey Korman) to force Herbie to \"walk the plank\". Having fallen into the ocean, Herbie is rescued by Paco and disguised as a taxi, later to stop a gang of con artists from stealing ancient Inca gold. Early in their partnership, Paco gives Herbie the nickname \"Ocho\" because he can't understand Herbie talking through his horn. Ocho is the Spanish word for the number 8; purportedly because the digits 5 and 3 in Herbie's racing number, 53, were combined to produce \"8\" (5+3 = 8) and possibly to rhyme with \"Vocho\", the Beetle's colloquial name in Mexico.\n\nAfter the Mexico debacle, Douglas takes in Herbie and opens a driving school in the TV series \"Herbie, the Love Bug\". There, Douglas meets a woman named Susan MacLane and her three kids: Julie, Matthew, and Robbie, with the kids become friends to Herbie, But; however, a business man named Randy Bigelow want to get rid of Herbie and Douglas and get Susan back after they broke up during his wedding.\n\nHank Cooper (Bruce Campbell) becomes the owner of Herbie in the 1997 made-for-television movie \"The Love Bug\". Here, Herbie's origins as a sentient Volkswagen Beetle are explained: an elderly German engineer named Dr. Gustav Stumpfel was building Herbie when a picture of his deceased wife fell into a vat of molten metal; with Stumpfel's love for her animating Herbie. During the film, Stumpfel is forced to build an evil Volkswagen counterpart to Herbie, \"Horace the Hate Bug\", from a sample of Herbie's original metal. Horace's personality is influenced by the narcissism of Herbie's former owner Simon when he has a picture of himself dropped into the metal vats, and kills Herbie during the film. Cooper buries Herbie, but the return of Jim Douglas sets Cooper to rebuild the fallen Love Bug (with the help of the repentant Dr. Stumpfel) and have him race against Simon and Horace. In this race, Herbie ultimately divides himself in half (as in the original film) to win the race.\n\nOver the years Herbie is passed down from owner to owner (including someone named \"Maxx\", who left his driver suit inside the hood), competing in many races, until he starts losing constantly to newer and faster cars, and later found by a tow truck driver in a garage and carried to Crazy Dave's scrapyard and, later, bought by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan) in \"\" (2005). He is later modified, becoming a 2002-cc-engined car and participating in various races, from a demolition derby to the final race of the Nextel Cup Series. Herbie eventually falls in love with a Volkswagen New Beetle (which, at the end, is revealed to be a sentient car too).\n\nHerbie has been the central character of five theatrical-release films, a made-for-TV movie, and a short-lived television series.\n\nA television series, \"Herbie, the Love Bug\", was aired in 1982 on CBS. Dean Jones reprised his role as Jim Douglas for the series. Five episodes were made.\n\n\nHerbie's appearance remained consistent throughout the first four film entries as well as the 1982 television series. There were only minor, subtle changes. The 1997 TV movie and \"Herbie: Fully Loaded\" featured major overhauls in Herbie's appearance, as there were different production crews working for Disney by this time.\nIn order to create the effect of Herbie driving himself, Disney concocted a detailed system of sprockets and pulleys connected to a second steering column under the front seat for a rear seat driver. There was also a second set of pedal assemblies, clutch cables and a shifter extension. In \"The Love Bug\", the rear seat driver sat low enough to see over the windshield but still out of the view of the camera. For \"Herbie Rides Again\" and \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\", Disney installed a hood-mounted Carello fog light that concealed a small camera which allowed the rear seat driver to view the street and sit lower.\n\nIn the original film, \"The Love Bug\", the original racing stripes differ from those in later movies; the stripes do not cover the valances or louvers of the car and the blue is a lighter shade. Also, Herbie features color-keyed running boards, while in later films the running boards are standard black.\n\nDuring the film, depending on the scene, the wheels change from standard VW wheels (although fitted with plain hubcaps with no VW logo) to specially widened wheels on the racing Herbies. During one scene (when Tennessee is hanging out of the window), the \"53\" logo (a.k.a. \"gumball\") on the passenger-side door is missing. The door is also cut along the lower edge at an angle to enable the car to tilt over to the right on two wheels.\n\nOne of the modified racing Herbies featured a Porsche 356 engine, brakes and KONI shock absorbers. All Herbies in \"The Love Bug\" had the VW badges removed from the hood and featured plain non-VW hubcaps. The hood-mounted VW logo was replaced with a plain disc of the same diameter, colored to match the body. All VWs logos were removed to avoid any trademark conflicts.\n\nIn \"Herbie Rides Again\", Herbie features revised racing stripes, with the original blue switched to a dark navy. In addition, the stripes were applied over the valances and louvers, and the front hood was recycled for 1982's television series \"Herbie the Matchmaker\". Herbie also received a hood-mounted Carello fog light, and his running boards were now the more conventional black.\n\nAdditionally, Herbie was running on standard wheels yet again. Volkswagen also promoted the film by having a Type 1 Beetle, complete with Herbie livery, in every showroom. There are various model errors in this film, such as the later \"big window\" (post-1964) Beetles being used. Also of note is the \"cut-n-shut\" engine cover after the warehouse break-in. The Beetle used was a late model, having a more bulbous flat-bottomed lid with an earlier rounded bottom edge welded on.\n\nAfter the success of \"The Love Bug\", the film was heavily endorsed by Volkswagen, which was in financial trouble at the time, when Beetle sales in North America were considerably lower than in previous decades. As such, the company insisted that the VW logos appear on Herbie. Both the hub cap VW logo and hood-mounted VW logo were reinstated at the company's request.\n\nIn \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\", Herbie is again fitted with wide racing wheels (Goodyear GT radials), and has an external fuel filler cap. Post-1967 Beetles did feature the fuel tank accessible on the right side behind the fender; the silver cap itself, however, was fake and added for the film's storyline. With the addition of the fuel filler, the antenna is now a retractable unit fitted on the front cowling, near the windshield wipers. He has a roll cage again, and he has Monte Carlo racing stickers on his windows (one on the front window, two on the left back window, and one on the rear window). Herbie still sports the hood-mounted Carello fog light with an added black cover sporting the company name. He now has gray bucket seats instead of stitched seats. Throughout this film, Herbie has an asymmetrical door mirror. There were a total of 9 VWs used in \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\". Many of these cars were recycled for use in \"Herbie Goes Bananas\".\nIn \"Herbie Goes Bananas\", the hood-mounted light, the grey roll cage bar, the Monte Carlo racing stickers and the silver gas cap were removed. He still had his gray bucket seats, asymmetrical door mirror and his Goodyear GT Radial racing tires and rims, and Herbie's sunroof was the original light gray rather than the dark gray from Monte Carlo. The rust seen on the car in this film was painted on some of the Herbies. The car that \"walks the plank\" in the movie was never recovered from the sea. It was tossed overboard from the \"M.N. Coromuel\" ferry ship (not \"The Sun Princess\" cruise ship). The car is somewhere between La Paz and Baja California. The car thrown overboard was not a proper car and had many wooden parts.\n\n\"Herbie Goes Bananas\" also featured the same later model door mirror as \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\". Herbie set a Guinness World Record as the first car to go through the Panama Canal during filming in 1979. Herbie's name is only mentioned 3 times in the film by the garage owner, apart from the two times Herbie honks his horn at Paco trying to say his name when Paco couldn't understand what Herbie was saying.\n\nSome of these Herbie cars were recycled for \"Herbie, the Love Bug\" in 1982.\n\nOne of the actual film cars used with its flip wheel chassis in the bullfighting scenes now resides in Sydney, Australia. Another one was displayed in the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum until the museum's closure in 2011. Since then its new location remains unknown.\n\nVolkswagen ceased the sale of Beetles in the USA one year before the film's release.\n\nIn \"The Love Bug\" television film there were some significant changes. The graphics used were copied from the 1974 Volkswagen of America decal kit, and the position on the front hood 53 was higher up. The racing stripes were different sizes, and the shade of blue reverted to the lighter version used in the original 1968 movie. The sunroof was a solid white (vs. gray) and was missing the racing stripes. Herbie's wheels were standard Beetle wheels, instead of the wider GoodYear GT Radial racing tires used in \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\" and \"Herbie Goes Bananas\", and the seats were regular instead of the gray bucket seats he had previously had.\n\nIn \"\", Herbie, who in this film seemed to be able to show emotions miming a face, went through several \"costume changes\" throughout the movie, changing his style dramatically from scene to scene.\n\n\nMore than 30 different Herbies were used during the shooting of this film, and three original cars are known to be on display. There is one at the Volo Auto Museum in Illinois and two other vehicles in California, one fully motorized is preserved at the Peterson Automotive Museum and a “personality car” at the hobby store Electric Dreams. Both California cars were used during the NASCAR racing segment of the film.\n"}

In his service at an early age, Zarco commanded the caravels guarding the coast of Algarve from the incursions of the Moors, was at the conquest of Ceuta, and later led the caravels that recognized the island of Porto Santo in 1418 to 1419 and afterward, the island of Madeira 1419 to 1420. He founded the city of Câmara de Lobos. He was granted, as hereditary leader (Capitania), half the island of Madeira (the Capitania of Funchal, being its first Captain-major). Together with his fellow fleet commanders, Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo, he started the colonization of the islands in 1425. In his role of knight of Prince Henry's house he participated in the siege of Tangier, in 1437, which ended in failure.

The first Christian chapel on this site dates from 1095, and operated as a Catholic church until the Reformation. The current church dates from 1686, and has served Church of Ireland parishioners in Dublin for more than 300 years.\n\nBuilt on the site of an early Norse chapel from 1095, the current structure dates largely from a reconstruction undertaken under William Robinson in 1686, but is still the only parish church on the north side of the Liffey surviving from a Viking foundation.\n\nWhile the exterior of the church may be unimpressive, the interior boasts some fine woodwork, and an organ (dated 1724) on which Handel is said to have composed his \"Messiah\".\n\nThe vaults of St. Michan's uniquely contain many mummified remains. The walls in the vaults contain limestone, which has kept the air dry, creating ideal conditions for preservation. Among the preserved remains are the 400-year-old body of a nun, a six-and-a-half foot man popularly believed to have been a crusader, a body with its feet and right hand severed, and the Sheares brothers—Henry and John—who took part in the 1798 rebellion. The various holders of the title Earl of Leitrim were also interred here.\n\nA number of crypts in the St. Michan's vaults were damaged by vandals in 1996 and again in early 2019. Following the 2019 incident, the church stated that several mummified remains were desecrated by vandals, including the remains of a 400-year-old nun, and the decapitation of the 800-year-old 'crusader'.\n\nThe church vaults are open to tours on Saturdays, and seasonally on some weekdays, receiving approximately 27,000 visitors during 2018. Following the vandalism event in early 2019, these tours were temporarily cancelled, recommencing by early July 2019.\n\nThe organ, built circa 1940 by Evans and Barr of Belfast, is housed within the eighteenth-century organ case constructed by John Baptiste Cuvillie between 1723–1725. The three manual pneumatic console employs modern compass and playing dimensions yet has been squeezed into the space originally occupied by much narrower keyboards. The Swell division features a slider soundboard, with separate pneumatic underaction; the Great and Choir divisions are served by sliderless ventil chests. Stopaction is pneumatic throughout.\n\nIn front of the gallery is the Organ Trophy, a carved wooden piece which depicts 17 musical instruments and was installed in 1724. It is widely considered that George Frideric Handel practised in advance of the first performance of Messiah on this organ.\n"}

After military service during the First World War, he trained with the Faith Mission and served with them, mainly in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, including on the island of Skye. He was particularly equipped for this as a native Gaelic speaker.\n\nIn 1925, Campbell resigned from the Faith Mission and married Shona Gray, whom he had long known. She had just returned for health reasons from two years service with Algiers Mission Band. He served as a missionary at the United Free Church at Ardvasar on Skye, but dissented from that church's union with the Church of Scotland with the result that he had to give up his post.\n\nCampbell's next post was ministering to a church at Balintore, Easter Ross which had also dissented from the union, building a new church for the continuing United Free Church where he ministered until he accepted the call to the United Free Church at Falkirk. In 1942, during his work there, Campbell was ordained as a minister. He later described this period as 'years of backsliding ... a barren spiritual wilderness'.\n\nIn 1949, Campbell felt called to rejoin the Faith Mission, which provided him with a house in Edinburgh. However, his ministry took him back to Skye, where he had worked 25 years before, travelling to and from Edinburgh by motorcycle. This work was successful, leading to people being converted to Christ. He was thoroughly engaged in that work when he received the call to go to the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. He initially resisted this call, but doors closed in Skye, opening the opportunity for him to go.\n\nThe call came from the Reverend James Murray MacKay, at the prompting of two Gaelic-speaking sisters in their eighties, who had been praying for revival. It was only at the third invitation that Campbell accepted. Over the following years he traveled from village to village preaching with many people being converted.\n\nOn one occasion Campbell was the main preacher at the Faith Mission Convention at Hamilton Road Presbyterian Church in Bangor, Northern Ireland, when he suddenly felt that he must leave at once, despite being engaged to speak at the closing meeting there the next day. He went (according to the call) to the island of Berneray off Harris, where he met an elder of the local church (then without a minister), who was so convinced that Campbell was coming that he had already announced the meetings at which Campbell was to preach. After several days of meetings, suddenly the island was gripped with a new awareness of God.\n\nAfter unreliable reports of events on Lewis, he published a booklet, \"The Lewis Awakening\", as an official account of this revival.\n\nIn 1958, Campbell was called to become principal of the Faith Mission's Training Home and Bible College in Edinburgh, where he served for a number of years, before retiring. During his retirement, he was a regular preacher at conventions in Great Britain, Ireland, South Africa, the United States and elsewhere, including the Stornoway Convention, which he had founded. He was also a visiting lecturer at colleges, such as Youth With A Mission's School of Evangelism at Lausanne in Switzerland, and died while lecturing there.\n\nCampbell was outspoken about two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit. The first was that, in his view, a true revival was a move of God that affected, not only church members, but the surrounding community in a way that was visible to all parties concerned (work stopping, bars closing, crime ceasing, etc.). The second was the definite and profound experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost subsequent to conversion.\n\nHis practice in evangelistic meetings was not to make the usual altar call, but to invite people to come to another room to pray and seek God. In his ministry in Lewis, he sought to transcend denominational boundaries, but this was at times difficult.\n\nDuncan Campbell was, before everything else, a man of prayer and almost invariably started the day with a period of prayer and study of the Bible.\n\nThe story of Duncan Campbell during the Hebridean Revival is told in the 2008 documentary film \"Great Christian Revivals\". An extract from the film: \"Duncan Campbell said, 'Revival is a community saturated with God.' Campbell witnessed first hand the Spirit of God descending upon a community and learned to let the Holy Spirit have His way. In his own words, 'Seventy-five percent (of the people) were gloriously saved before they came near a meeting... the power of God was moving!'\"\n\n\n"}

Maharaja Surat Singh Rathore (b.1787 – d.1828) of Bikaner State won this fort on Tuesday. Since Tuesday is the auspicious day of the Hindu deity Hanuman, Surat Singh renamed Bhatner to \"Hanumangarh\" - the Fort of Hanuman the Hindu-deity. A 1700-year-old Bhatner fort is situated in the middle of Hanumangarh Town, the description of which can be found in \"Ain-i-Akbari\".

{"id": "2036036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036036", "title": "Methodist Church of Great Britain", "text": "Methodist Church of Great Britain\n\nThe Methodist Church of Great Britain is a Protestant Christian denomination in Britain and the mother church to Methodists worldwide. It participates in the World Methodist Council, the World Council of Churches and other ecumenical associations.\n\nMethodism began primarily through the work of John Wesley (1703–1791), who led an evangelical revival in 18th-century Britain. An Anglican priest, Wesley adopted unconventional and controversial practices, such as open-air preaching, to reach factory labourers and newly urbanised masses uprooted from their traditional village culture at the start of the Industrial Revolution. His preaching centred upon the universality of God's grace for all, the effect of faith on character and the possibility of perfection in love during this life. He organised the new converts locally and in a \"Connexion\" across Britain.\n\nFollowing Wesley's death, the Methodist revival became a separate church and ordained its own ministers; it is called a Nonconformist church because it does not conform to the rules of the established Church of England. In the 19th century, the Wesleyan Methodist Church experienced many secessions, with the largest of the offshoots being the Primitive Methodists. The main streams of Methodism were reunited in 1932, forming the Methodist Church as it is today.\n\nMethodist circuits, containing several local churches, are gathered into thirty districts. The supreme governing body of the church is the annual Methodist Conference; it is headed by the president of Conference, a presbyteral minister, supported by a vice-president who can be a local preacher or deacon.\n\nThe 2009 British Social Attitudes Survey found that around 800,000 people, or 1.29 per cent of the British population, identified as Methodist. , active membership stood at approximately 173,000, representing a 14.3 per cent decline from the 2014 figure. Methodism is the fourth-largest Christian group in Britain. Around 202,000 people attend a Methodist church service each week, while 490,000 to 500,000 take part in some other form of Methodist activity, such as youth work and community events organised by local churches.\n\nThe movement which would become the Methodist Church began in the mid-18th century within the Church of England. A small group of students, including John Wesley, Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, met at Oxford University. They focused on methodical study of the Bible and living a holy life. Other students mocked them, saying they were the \"Holy Club\" and \"the Methodists\", being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle.\n\nThe first Methodist movement outside the Church of England was associated with Howell Harris, who led the Welsh Methodist revival. This was to become the Calvinistic Methodist Church (today known as the Presbyterian Church of Wales). Another branch of the Methodist revival was under the ministry of George Whitefield, resulting in the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion.\nThe largest branch of Methodism in England was organised by John Wesley; he took to open-air preaching to recruit followers to his movement. He formed small classes in which his followers would receive religious guidance and intensive accountability in their personal lives. Wesley also appointed itinerant evangelists to travel and preach as he did and to care for these groups of people. It is a tribute to Wesley's powers of oratory and organisational skills that the term \"Methodism\" is today assumed to mean \"Wesleyan Methodism\" unless otherwise specified. Theologically, Wesley held to the \"Arminian\" view that salvation is available to all people, in contrast to the \"Calvinist\" ideas of election and predestination that were accepted by the Calvinistic Methodists.\n\nMethodist preachers were famous for their enthusiastic sermons. During Wesley's lifetime, many members of England's established church feared that new doctrines promulgated by the Methodists, such as the necessity of a new birth for salvation, of justification by faith and of the constant and sustained action of the Holy Spirit upon the believer's soul, would produce ill effects upon weak minds. Theophilus Evans, an early critic of the movement, even wrote that it was \"the natural Tendency of their Behaviour, in Voice and Gesture and horrid Expressions, to make People mad\". In one of his prints, William Hogarth likewise attacked Methodists as \"enthusiasts\" full of \"Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism\". Other attacks against the Methodists were physically violent—Wesley was nearly murdered by a mob at Wednesbury in 1743. The Methodists responded vigorously to their critics and thrived despite the attacks against them.\nAs Wesley and his colleagues preached around the country they formed local societies, authorised and organised through Wesley's leadership and conferences of preachers. Wesley insisted that Methodists regularly attend their local parish church as well as Methodist meetings. In 1784, Wesley made provision for the continuance as a corporate body after his death of the 'Yearly Conference of the People called Methodists'. He nominated 100 people and declared them to be its members and laid down the method by which their successors were to be appointed. The Conference has remained the governing body of Methodism ever since.\n\nAs his societies multiplied, and elements of an ecclesiastical system were successively adopted, the breach between Wesley and the Church of England (Anglicanism) gradually widened. In 1784, Wesley responded to the shortage of priests in the American colonies due to the American Revolutionary War by ordaining preachers for America with power to administer the sacraments. Wesley's actions precipitated the split between American Methodists and the Church of England (which held that only bishops could ordain persons to ministry).\n\nWith regard to the position of Methodism within Christendom, \"John Wesley once noted that what God had achieved in the development of Methodism was no mere human endeavor but the work of God. As such it would be preserved by God so long as history remained.\" Calling it \"the grand depositum\" of the Methodist faith, Wesley specifically taught that the propagation of the doctrine of entire sanctification was the reason that God raised up the Methodists in the world.\n\nBritish Methodism separated from the Church of England soon after the death of Wesley. There were early contentions over the powers of preachers and the Conference, and the timing of chapel services. At this point in time a majority of Methodist members were not attending Anglican church services. The 1795 Plan of Pacification permitted Methodist chapels to celebrate Holy Communion where both a majority of trustees and a majority of the stewards and leaders allowed it. (These services often used Wesley's abridgement of the \"Book of Common Prayer\".) This permission was later extended to the administration of baptism, burial and timing of services, bringing Methodist chapels into direct competition with the local parish church. Consequently, known Methodists were excluded from the Church of England. Alexander Kilham and his \"radicals\" denounced the Conference for giving too much power to the ministers of the church at the expense of the laity. In 1797, following the Plan of Pacification, Kilham was expelled from the church. The radicals formed the Methodist New Connexion, while the original body came to be known as the Wesleyan Methodist Church.\n\nEarly Methodists were systematic in collecting statistics on membership. Their growth was rapid, from 58,000 in 1790 to 302,000 in 1830 and 518,000 in 1850. Those were the official members, but the national census of 1851 counted people with an informal connection to Methodism, and the total was 1,463,000. Growth was steady in both rural and urban areas, despite disruption caused by numerous schisms; these resulted in separate denominations (or \"connexions\") such as the Wesleyan Methodist Church, the first and largest, followed by the New Connexion, the Bible Christian Church and the Primitive Methodist Church. (They would be eventually reunited in the Methodist Union of 1932.) Some of the growth can be attributed to the failure of the established Church of England to provide church facilities. A series of reforms in the established church helped to correct that failure, so there were fewer opportunities for the Nonconformists in general and the Methodists in particular to keep growing. Membership reached 602,000 in 1870 and peaked at 841,000 in 1910.\n\nEarly Methodism was particularly prominent in Devon and Cornwall, which were key centers of activity by the Bible Christian faction. The Bible Christians produced many preachers, and sent many missionaries to Australia. Methodism as a whole grew rapidly in the old mill towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire, where the preachers stressed that the working classes were equal to the upper classes in the eyes of God. In Wales, three elements separately welcomed Methodism: Welsh-speaking, English-speaking, and Calvinistic.\n\nThe independent Methodist movement did not appeal to England's landed gentry; they favoured the developing evangelical movement inside the Church of England. However, Methodism became popular among ambitious middle class families. For example, the Osborn family of Sheffield, whose steel company emerged in the mid-19th century in Sheffield's period of rapid industrialisation. Historian Clyde Binfield says their fervent Methodist faith strengthened their commitment to economic independence, spiritual certainty and civic responsibility.\n\nMethodism was especially popular among skilled workers and much less prevalent among labourers. Historians such as Élie Halévy, Eric J. Hobsbawm and E. P. Thompson, have explored the role of Methodism in the early decades of the making of the British working class (1760–1820). On the one hand it provided a model of how to efficiently organise large numbers of people and sustain their connection over a long period of time, and on the other it diverted and discouraged political radicalism. In explaining why Britain did not undergo a social revolution in the period 1790–1832, a time that appeared ripe for violent social upheaval, Halévy argued that Methodism forestalled revolution among the working class by redirecting its energies toward spiritual affairs rather than workplace concerns. Thompson argues that overall it had a politically regressive effect.\n\nJohn Wesley was the longtime president of the Methodist Conference, but after his death it was agreed that in future, so much authority would not be placed in the hands of one man. Instead, the president would be elected for one year, to sit in Wesley's chair. Successive Methodist schisms resulted in multiple presidents, before a united conference assembled in 1932.\n\nWesley wrote, edited or abridged some 400 publications. As well as theology he wrote about music, marriage, medicine, abolitionism and politics. Wesley himself and the senior leadership were political conservatives. Although many trade union leaders were attracted to Methodism—the Tolpuddle Martyrs being an early example—the church itself did not actively support the unions. Historians Patrick O'Brien and Roland Quinault argue:\n\nJabez Bunting (1779–1858) was the most prominent leader of the Wesleyan Methodist movement after Wesley's death. He preached successful revivals until 1802, when he saw revivals leading to dissension and division. He then became dedicated to church order and discipline, and vehemently opposed revivalism. He was a popular preacher in numerous cities. He was four times chosen to be president of the Conference and held numerous senior positions as administrator and watched budgets very closely. Bunting and his allies centralised power by making the Conference the final arbiter of Methodism, and giving it the power to reassign preachers and select superintendents. He was zealous in the cause of foreign missions. In English politics he was conservative. He had little tolerance for liberal elements or for Sunday schools and temperance crusades, which led to expulsion of his opponents, whereupon a third of the members broke away in 1849. Numerous alliances with other groups failed and weakened his control.\n\nWilliam Bramwell was a preacher who engendered controversy due to his intense revivalist preaching style, which spurred awakenings throughout the north of England—including the 1793-97 Yorkshire Revival—and his association with Alexander Kilham (1762–1798). Kilham was a revivalist who led the New Connexion secession from mainstream Wesleyan ministry.\n\nHugh Price Hughes (1847–1902) was the first superintendent of the West London Methodist Mission, a key Methodist organisation. Recognised as one of the greatest orators of his era, he also founded and edited an influential newspaper, the \"Methodist Times\" in 1885. Hughes played a key role in leading Methodists into the Liberal Party coalition, away from the Conservative leanings of previous Methodist leaders.\n\nJohn Scott Lidgett (1854–1953) achieved prominence both as a theologian and reformer by stressing the importance of the church's engagement with the whole of society and human culture. He promoted the Social Gospel and founded the Bermondsey Settlement to reach the poor of London, as well as the \"Wesley Guild\", a social organisation aimed at young people which reached 150,000 members by 1900.\n\nEarly Methodism experienced a radical and spiritual phase that allowed women authority in church leadership. The role of the woman preacher emerged from the sense that the home should be a place of community care and should foster personal growth. Women gained self-esteem at this time when members were encouraged to testify about the nature of their faith. Methodist women formed a community that cared for the vulnerable, extending the role of mothering beyond physical care. However the centrality of women's role sharply diminished after 1790 as the church became more structured and more male dominated.\n\nIn the 18th century Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon (1707–91), played a major role in financing and guiding early Methodism. Selina was the first female principal of a men's college in Wales, Trevecca College, for the education of Methodist ministers. She financed the building of 64 chapels in England and Wales, wrote often to George Whitefield and John Wesley and funded mission work in colonial America. She is best remembered for her adversarial relationships with other Methodists who objected to a woman having power.\n\nMethodists placed a high priority on close guidance of their youth, as seen in the activities of Sunday schools and the Band of Hope (a temperance organisation in which children took a pledge of total abstinence from alcohol).\nWesley himself opened schools at The Foundery in London, and Kingswood School. A Wesleyan report in 1832 said that for the church to prosper the system of Sunday schools should be augmented by day-schools with educated teachers. It was proposed in 1843 that 700 new day-schools be established within seven years. Though a steady increase was achieved, that ambitious target could not be reached, in part limited by the number of suitably qualified teachers. Most teachers came from one institution in Glasgow. The Wesleyan Education Report for 1844 called for a permanent Wesleyan teacher-training college. The result was the foundation of Westminster Training College at Horseferry Road, Westminster in 1851.\n\n19th century England lacked a state school system; the major supplier was the Church of England. The Wesleyan Education Committee, which existed from 1838 to 1902, has documented Methodism's involvement in the education of children. At first most effort was placed in creating Sunday schools. In 1832 there were 3,339 Sunday schools with 59,277 teachers and 341,442 pupils. In 1836 the Wesleyan Methodist Conference gave its blessing to the creation of \"Weekday schools\". In 1902 the Methodists operated 738 schools, so their children would not have to learn from Anglican teachers. The Methodists, along with other Nonconformists, bitterly opposed the Education Act of 1902, which funded Church of England schools, and funded Methodists schools too but placed them under local education authorities. In the 20th century the number of Methodist Church-operated schools declined, as many became state-run schools, with only 28 still operating in 1996.\n\nThrough vigorous missionary work, Methodism spread throughout the British Empire. It was especially successful in the new United States, thanks to the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. English emigrants brought Methodism to Canada and Australia. British and American missionaries reached out to India and some other imperial colonies. In general the conversion efforts were only modestly successful, but reports back to Britain did have an influence in shaping how Methodists understood the wider world.\n\nHistorians group Methodists together with other Protestant groups as \"Nonconformists\" or \"Dissenters\", standing in opposition to the established Church of England. In the 19th century the Dissenters who went to chapel comprised half the people who actually attended services on Sunday. The \"Nonconformist conscience\" was their moral sensibility which they tried to implement in British politics. The two categories of Dissenters, or Nonconformists, were in addition to the evangelicals or \"Low Church\" element in the Church of England. \"Old Dissenters\", dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, included Baptists, Congregationalists, Quakers, Unitarians and Presbyterians outside Scotland. \"New Dissenters\" emerged in the 18th century and were mainly Methodists, especially the Wesleyan Methodists.\n\nThe \"Nonconformist conscience\" of the \"Old\" group emphasised religious freedom and equality, pursuit of justice, and opposition to discrimination, compulsion and coercion. The \"New Dissenters\" (and also the Anglican evangelicals) stressed personal morality issues, including sexuality, temperance, family values and Sabbath-keeping. Both factions were politically active, but until the mid-19th century the Old group supported mostly Whigs and Liberals in politics, while the New generally supported Conservatives. However the Methodists changed and in the 1880s moved into the Liberal Party, drawn in large part by Gladstone's intense moralism. The result was a merging of the Old and New, strengthening their great weight as a political pressure group. They joined together on new issues especially supporting temperance and opposing the Education Act 1902, with the former of special interest to Methodists. By 1914 the conscience was weakening and by the 1920s it was virtually dead politically.\n\nIn the early days of Methodism chapels were sometimes built octagonal, largely to avoid conflict with the established Church of England. The first was in Norwich (1757); it was followed by Rotherham (1761), Whitby (1762), Yarm (1763), Heptonstall (1764) and nine others. John Wesley personally approved the design of the octagonal chapels, stating, \"It is better for the voice and on many accounts more commodious than any other.\" He is also said to have added—\"there are no corners for the devil to hide in\".\n\n\"Methodist Heritage\" records the Yarm chapel as the oldest in England in continual use. Its design and construction were overseen by Wesley, who preached at the chapel frequently and declared it as his \"favourite\".\n\nNevertheless, the Heptonstall chapel has also contested for the title of oldest octagon chapel in continual use. The building featured in the BBC television series \"Churches: How to Read Them\". Presenter Richard Taylor named it as one of his ten favourite churches, saying: \"If buildings have an aura, this one radiated friendship.\"\n\nThe Wesleyan Methodists' rejection of revivals and camp meetings led to the founding in 1820 of the Primitive Methodist Connexion in England and Scotland, which emphasised those practices. It was a democratic, lay-oriented movement. Its social base was among the poorer members of society; they appreciated both its content (damnation, salvation, sinners and saints) and style (direct, spontaneous, and passionate). It offered an alternative to the more middle class Wesleyan Methodists and the upper class controlled Anglican established church, and in turn sometimes led adherents to Pentecostalism. The Primitive Methodists were poorly funded and had trouble building chapels or schools, and supporting ministers. Growth was strong in the middle 19th century. Membership declined after 1900 because of growing secularism in society, a resurgence of Anglicanism among the working classes, competition from other Nonconformist denominations (including William Booth's Salvation Army), and competition among different Methodist branches.\n\nThe leading theologian of the Primitive Methodists was Arthur Peake (1865–1929), professor of biblical criticism at the University of Manchester, 1904–29. He was active in numerous leadership roles and promoted Methodist Union that came about in 1932 after his death. He popularised modern biblical scholarship, including the new higher criticism. He approached the Bible not as the infallible word of God, but as the record of revelation written by fallible humans.\n\nMembership of the various Methodist branches peaked at 841,000 in 1910, then fell steadily to 425,000 in 1990. The second half of the 19th century saw many of the small schisms reunited to become the United Methodist Free Churches and a further union in 1907 with the Methodist New Connexion and Bible Christian Church brought the United Methodist Church into being. In 1908 the major three branches were the Wesleyan Methodists, the Primitive Methodists and the United Methodists. After the late 19th century evangelical approaches to the unchurched were less effective and less used. Methodists paid more attention to their current membership, and less to outreach, while middle-class family size shrank steadily. There were fewer famous preachers or outstanding leaders. The theological change that emphasised the conversion experience as being a one-time lifetime event rather than as a step on the road to perfection lessened the importance of the class meeting and made revivals less meaningful. The growth mechanisms that had worked so well in the expansion phase in the early 19th century were largely discarded, including revivals and the personal appeal to decide for Christ class meetings, as well as the love feast, the Sunday night prayer-meeting, and the open-air meeting. The failure to grow was signaled by the flagging experience of the Sunday schools, whose enrolments fell steadily.\nWith the Methodist Union of 1932 the three main Methodist connexions in Britain—the Wesleyans, Primitive Methodists and United Methodist Church—came together to form the present Methodist Church. Some offshoots of Methodism, such as the Salvation Army and Church of the Nazarene, as well as the Independent Methodist Connexion, remain totally separate organisations.\n\nReginald Ward states that because the union of 1932 was unevenly implemented until the 1950s, it distracted attention away from the urgent need to revive the fast-shrinking movement. The hoped-for financial gains proved to be illusory, and Methodist leaders spent the early post-war era vainly trying to achieve union with the Church of England. Multiple approaches were used to turn around the membership decline and flagging zeal in the post-war era, but none worked well. For example, Methodist group tours were organised, but they ended when it was clear they made little impact.\n\nDuring the 20th century Methodists increasingly embraced socialist ideas. Donald Soper (1903–1998) was perhaps the most widely recognised Methodist leader. An activist, he promoted pacifism and nuclear disarmament in cooperation with the Labour Party. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was a moralistic Methodist; Soper denounced her policies as unchristian. However, in \"the battle for Britain's soul\" she was reelected over and over. Historian Martin Wellings says of Soper:\n\nIn 1967, Soper, then the only Methodist minister in the House of Lords, lamented that:\n\nScholars have suggested multiple possible reasons for the decline, but have not agreed on their relative importance. Wellings lays out the \"classical model\" of secularization, while noting that it has been challenged by some scholars.\n\nOver the ten-year period from 2006 to 2016 membership decreased from 262,972 to 188,398. This represents a decline at a rate of 3.5 per cent year-on-year.\n\nMethodism was endowed by the Wesley brothers with worship characterised by a twofold practice: the ritual liturgy of the Anglican \"Book of Common Prayer\" on the one hand and the simple preaching service on the other. Listening to the reading of Scripture and a sermon based upon the biblical text is virtually always included in Methodist worship. The Methodist Church follows the Revised Common Lectionary, in common with other major denominations in Britain. Similar to most historic Christian churches, the Methodist Church has official liturgies for services such as Holy Communion, baptism, ordination and marriage. These and other patterns of worship are contained in the \"Methodist Worship Book\", the most recent Methodist service book. It states in its preface that worship is \"a gracious encounter between God and the Church. God speaks to us, especially through scripture read and proclaimed and through symbols and sacraments. We respond chiefly through hymns and prayers and acts of dedication.\" Methodism has generally allowed for freedom in how the liturgy is celebrated—the \"Worship Book\" serves as a guideline, but ministers, preachers and other worship leaders are not obligated to use it.\nThe Methodist Church has used a succession of hymnals and service books. The \"Methodist Hymn-Book\" (1933) was the first hymnal published after the 1932 union. In 1936 the church authorised the \"Book of Offices\", including an \"Order for Morning Prayer\", which closely replicated the \"Book of Common Prayer\" (1662). Later, the \"Methodist Service Book\" (1975) modernised the language used in the Communion prayers; its widespread usage has been cited as a cause for increased frequency of Communion celebration in the Methodist Church. The publication of a new hymnal, \"Hymns and Psalms\" (1983), expanded the repertoire of 20th century compositions.\n\nThe \"Methodist Worship Book\" (1999) includes a wider range of services for every season; it continues the 1975 service book's intention of preserving Methodist traditions while taking into account the insights of the liturgical renewal movement. Its publication prompted minor controversy due to the utilisation of gender-neutral language and the inclusion of a prayer addressed to \"God our Father and our \"Mother\"\". This was seen by some as a \"challenging\" departure from the masculine language which is traditionally used when referring to God.\n\nMethodism is known for its rich musical tradition, and Charles Wesley was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the Methodist Church. \"Singing the Faith\" is the current hymnal, published by the church in 2011. It contains 748 hymns and songs and 42 liturgical settings (such as the Kyrie, the Sanctus and the Lord's Prayer, as well as material from the Taizé and Iona traditions). There are also 50 canticles and psalms, selected on the basis of their use within liturgy. The collection of 89 hymns by Charles Wesley is a reduction from over 200 in the 1933 \"Hymn-Book\".\n\nMethodist congregations celebrate Holy Communion within a Sunday service generally at least once a month. The practice of an 'open table' is widespread in the Methodist Church. Although the phrasing and exact requirements in a particular local church may vary, generally all \"who love the Lord Jesus Christ\" are invited to receive bread and wine, irrespective of age or denominational identity. \"Guidelines about Children and Holy Communion\", issued in 1987, affirmed that those receiving communion should, if not already baptised, be encouraged to be baptised—though acknowledging that this \"theological principle\" was not widely adhered to.\n\nA distinctive liturgical feature of British Methodism is the Covenant Service. Methodists annually follow the call of John Wesley for a renewal of their covenant with God. In 1755, Wesley crafted the original Covenant Service using\nmaterial from the writings of eminent clerics Joseph and Richard Alleine. In 1780, Wesley printed an excerpt from Richard Alleine's \"Vindiciae Pietatis\", which is prayer for renewal of a believer's covenant with God. This excerpt, known in modified form as the Wesley Covenant Prayer, remained in use—linked with Holy Communion and observed on the first Sunday of the New Year—among Wesleyan Methodists until 1936. In the 1920s, Wesleyan minister George B. Robson expanded the form of the Covenant Service by replacing most of the exhortation with prayers of adoration, thanksgiving and confession. Robson's Covenant Service was revised and officially authorised for use in the \"Book of Offices\" (1936). Further revisions, strengthening the link with Communion and intercession for the wider church and the world, appeared in the \"Service Book\" (1975) and \"Worship Book\" (1999). This Covenant Prayer, which has been adopted by other Christian traditions, has been described as \"a celebration of all that God has done and an affirmation that we give our lives and choices to God\".\n\nA summary of Methodist doctrine is contained in the \"Catechism for the Use of the People Called Methodists\". Some core beliefs that are affirmed by most Methodists include:\n\nWesleyan tradition stands at a unique cross-roads between evangelical and sacramental, between liturgical and charismatic, and between Anglo-Catholic and Reformed theology and practice. It has been characterised as Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring holiness into the life of the participating believer. The Methodist Church teaches the Arminian concepts of free will, conditional election and sanctifying grace. John Wesley was perhaps the clearest English proponent of Arminianism. The church teaches that salvation is entirely a work of God alone with no work by which it can be earned (monergism), and that one cannot either turn to God nor believe unless God has first drawn a person and implanted the desire in their heart (the Wesleyan doctrine of prevenient grace).\n\nJohn Wesley believed that certain aspects of the Christian faith required special emphasis. Wesleyan Methodist minister William Fitzgerald (1856–1931) summarised the core emphases of Wesleyan doctrine by using four statements that collectively are called the 'Four Alls'. These are expressed:\n\nMethodists have emphasised the importance of scriptural holiness, which entails more than personal piety; love of God is always linked with love of neighbour, a passion for justice and renewal in the life of the world. John Wesley made much of the process of sanctification, occasionally even seeming to claim that individuals could achieve 'Christian perfection' in this life.\n\nIt is a traditional position of the Methodist Church that any disciplined theological work calls for the careful use of reason by which to understand God's action and will. However, Methodists also look to Christian tradition as a source of doctrine. Wesley himself believed that the living core of the Christian faith was revealed in the Bible as the sole foundational source. The centrality of Scripture was so important for Wesley that he called himself \"a man of one book\". Methodism has also emphasised a personal experience of faith; this is linked to the Methodist doctrine of assurance. These four elements taken together form the Wesleyan Quadrilateral.\n\nAccording to a conference report, \"A Lamp for our Feet and A Light to our Path\", issued in 2001 British Methodists hold a range of views about the Bible:\n\nThe Methodist Church understands itself to be part of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. It recognises the historic creeds, the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed, which may be used in church services.\n\nAlthough Methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time, these practices and beliefs can be traced to the writings, hymns and sermons of the church's founders, especially John Wesley and Charles Wesley. The Methodist Church does not possess a strict set of doctrines comparable to that of the Westminster Confession, but it does specify general doctrinal standards, as follows:\n\nThe Methodist Conference statement of 1976 says that the termination of any form of human life cannot be regarded superficially. The church has also stated that the \"unborn human\" should be accorded rights progressively as it develops through the stages of gestation, from embryo to fetus, culminating with full respect as an individual at birth. The 1976 statement gives examples of circumstances in which abortion may be permissible; these include situations where the life or health of the mother is at risk, in cases of serious abnormality where the child is incapable of survival, and in cases where the right of the unborn child to be healthy and wanted may not be met. The Methodist Church believes that its members should work toward the elimination of the need for abortion by advocating for social support for mothers. The conference statement argues that \"abortion must not be regarded as an alternative to contraception\", and disagrees with complete legalisation, recommending that abortion \"should remain subject to a legal framework and to responsible counselling and to medical judgement.\" Within this legal framework, it advocates limiting elective abortions to 20 weeks of pregnancy. The church generally approved of the Abortion Act 1967 which made abortion legal only under certain circumstances. It also supports the use of \"responsible contraception\" and family planning as ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe Methodist Church strongly opposes assisted suicide and euthanasia: \"The final stage of an illness is not one which need represent the ultimate defeat for the doctor or nurse, but a supreme opportunity to help the patient at many levels, including those relating to emotional and spiritual well-being ... Dedicated workers in this field of care, including specialised hospices, demonstrate that it is possible to deal with all the symptoms which cause problems to the patient ... Euthanasia, assisted dying – both are artificial precipitation of death. Many Christians believe this idea is wrong. An approach to death as outlined above makes euthanasia inappropriate and irrelevant.\"\n\nThe Methodist Church supported the campaign to abolish capital punishment in the United Kingdom, and since then has totally opposed its reintroduction.\n\nWithin the Methodist Church members have a broad range of views about human sexuality, relationships, and the purpose of marriage. The church condemns all practices of sexuality \"which are promiscuous, exploitative or demeaning in any way\". In his 1743 tract, \"Thoughts on marriage and a single life\", John Wesley taught that the ability to live a single life is given by God to all believers, although few people are able to accept this gift.\n\nIn 1993 the Methodist Conference met in Derby and passed six resolutions covering issues related with human sexuality (known as the \"Derby Resolutions\" or \"1993 Resolutions\"). Among these, the conference reaffirmed the traditional Christian teaching of \"chastity for all outside marriage and fidelity within it\". (The church defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman.) The Derby Resolutions also agreed that the church \"recognises, affirms and celebrates the participation and ministry of lesbians and gay men\" and allows the ordination of openly gay ministers.\n\nThe Methodist Church has a mixed position on the blessing of same-sex couples. In 2005 the Methodist Conference meeting in Torquay recommended that ministers be allowed to bless same-sex relationships, subject to local approval. It affirmed that the church should be \"welcoming and inclusive\" and not turn people away because of their sexual orientation. However, in 2006 the Methodist Conference decided not to allow formal blessings, although ministers were allowed to offer informal private prayers. The 2013 conference set up a working party to oversee a process of \"deep reflection and discernment\" before reporting back to the conference in 2016 with recommendations about whether the definition of marriage should be revised. Subsequently, in 2016 the conference voted to \"revisit\" the church's position on same-sex marriage, with a mandate from members \"expressing a desire to endorse same-sex relationships\". At present, although there are no formal services, \"prayers of thanksgiving or celebration may be said, and there may be informal services of thanksgiving or celebration...'Blessings', would be a formal liturgy, and are not permitted.\" The church has no rules prohibiting its members (including ministers) from entering into or remaining within a civil partnership or civil same-sex marriage. \nOn 3 July 2019 the Methodist Conference voted by 247 votes to 48 in principle to permit same-sex marriages in Methodist premises by Methodist ministers—a final decision is due to be made at the July 2020 conference.\n\nRegarding transgender people, the church has stated that, after transitioning, transgender people \"are permitted to marry [in a church ceremony] a person of the opposite gender under current marriage law\".\n\n\"Outcome\" is a representative group of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Methodists. It aims to strengthen the Methodist Church's position as an LGBT-affirming denomination. The group wants the church to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies.\n\nIn 1744, the directions the Wesleys gave to the Methodist societies required them \"to taste no spirituous [i.e., distilled] liquor ... unless prescribed by a physician.\" Methodists later took a leading role in the temperance movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and Methodism remains associated with teetotalism in many people's minds. Methodists saw alcoholic beverages, and alcoholism, as the root of many social ills and tried to persuade people to abstain from these. Temperance appealed strongly to the Methodist doctrines of sanctification and perfection. At one time, ministers had to take a pledge not to drink and encouraged their congregations to do the same. To this day, alcohol remains banned in Methodist premises. However, the choice to consume alcohol outside of church is now a personal decision for any member.\n\nThe Methodist Church has long used non-alcoholic wine (grape juice) in the sacrament of Holy Communion. In 1869, a Methodist dentist named Thomas Welch developed a method of pasteurising grape juice in order to produce an unfermented communion wine for his church. (He later founded Welch's grape juice company.) By the 1880s this non-alcoholic wine had become commonplace in Methodist churches worldwide.\n\nFrom the start Methodism was sympathetic towards poor people. In 1753, John Wesley bemoaned, \"So wickedly, devilishly false is that common objection, 'They are poor, only because they are idle'.\" In a Joint Public Issues Team report issued with the Baptist Union of Great Britain, the Church of Scotland and United Reformed Church, the Methodist Church regret this misconception is also prevalent today.\n\nDaleep Mukarji, Methodist Vice-President in 2013 and former Director of the charity Christian Aid, said economic inequality was more prevalent in 21st century Britain than at any time since World War II. Twenty-five per cent of British residents experience relative poverty, disproportionately many are children.\nIn 2016 there were 3,459 Methodist ministers, with 1,562 active in circuit ministry. The church recognises two orders of ordained ministry—that of presbyter and deacon.\nChurch documents refer to both as \"Minister\", though popular usage often limits this title to presbyters. Presbyters are styled \"The Reverend\", while \"Deacon\" is used as a title by members of the diaconate. Deacons (both men and women) also belong to a community of deacons in the Methodist Diaconal Order. The Deed of Union (the key foundation document of the Methodist Church since it became united in 1932) describes the roles of presbyters and deacons and the purpose of their ministries:\n\nChrist's ministers in the church are stewards in the household of God and shepherds of his flock. Some are called and ordained to this occupation as presbyters or deacons. Presbyters have a principal and directing part in these great duties but they hold no priesthood differing in kind from that which is common to all the Lord's people and they have no exclusive title to the preaching of the gospel or the care of souls. These ministries are shared with them by others to whom also the Spirit divides his gifts severally as he wills.\nThe two orders are equal in status, with presbyters and deacons each serving a distinct role in the ministry of the Methodist Church. Deacons are called to a ministry of service and witness: specifically to \"assist God's people in worship and prayer\" and \"to visit and support the sick and the suffering\". Presbyters are called to a ministry of word and sacrament: \"to preach by word and deed the Gospel of God's grace\" and \"to baptise, to confirm, and to preside at the celebration of the sacrament of Christ's body and blood.\" Presbyters are itinerant preachers, residing in a circuit for usually five years before transferring to another.\n\nMethodist presbyters are usually given pastoral charge of several local churches in a circuit. Ordinary presbyters are in turn overseen by a superintendent, who is the most senior minister in a circuit. Unlike many other Methodist denominations the British church does not have bishops. A report, \"What Sort of Bishops?\" to the conference of 2005, was accepted for study and report. This report considered whether this should now be changed, and if so, what forms of episcopacy might be acceptable. Consultation at grassroots level during 2006 and 2007 revealed overwhelming opposition from those who responded. As a consequence, the 2007 conference decided not to move towards having bishops at present.\n\nWithout bishops, the Methodist Church does not subscribe to the idea of an historical episcopate. It does, however, affirm the doctrine of apostolic succession. In 1937 the Methodist Conference located the \"true continuity\" with the church of past ages in \"the continuity of Christian experience, the fellowship in the gift of the one Spirit; in the continuity in the allegiance to one Lord, the continued proclamation of the message; the continued acceptance of the mission;...\" [through a long chain which goes back to] \"the first disciples in the company of the Lord Himself ... This is our doctrine of apostolic succession\" [which neither depends on, nor is secured by,] \"an official succession of ministers, whether bishops or presbyters, from apostolic times, but rather by fidelity to apostolic truth\".\n\nJohn Wesley allowed female preachers. The Primitive Methodist Church always allowed female preachers and ministers, although there were never many of them. The Wesleyan Methodist Church established an order of deaconesses in 1890. The Methodist Church has re-allowed ordination of women as presbyters since 2 July 1974, at the Methodist Conference in Bristol. The Methodist Church, along with some other Protestant churches, holds that when the historical contexts involved are understood, a coherent biblical argument can be made in favour of women's ordination.\n\nA distinctive feature of British Methodism is its extensive use of \"local preachers\" ('local' because they stay in the same circuit, as opposed to 'itinerant' preachers who move to different circuits, in the case of presbyters). They are laypeople or deacons who have been trained and accredited to preach and lead worship services in place of a presbyter; however, local preachers cannot ordinarily officiate at services of Holy Communion. Local preachers are thus similar to lay readers in the Church of England. It is estimated that local preachers conduct seven out of every ten Methodist services, either in their own circuit or in others where they are invited as \"visiting preachers\". All candidates for ordination as a presbyter in the Methodist Church are required to be admitted as local preachers before they can be formally accepted as candidates or begin their training.\n\nLocal preachers have played an important role in English and Welsh social history, especially among the working class and labour movement. Recent prominent public figures who preached include George Thomas, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1983, and Len Murray, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress from 1973 to 1983.\n\nMethodists belong to local churches (usually meeting in a building called a \"chapel\"), or local ecumenical partnerships, but also feel part of a larger connected community, known as \"The Connexion\". This sense of being connected makes a difference to how the Methodist Church as a whole is structured. From its inception under John Wesley, Methodism has always laid strong emphasis on the interdependence and mutual support, in terms of ministry and finance, of one local church for another. The church community has never been seen in isolation either from its immediately neighbouring church communities or from the centralised national organisation. When ministers are ordained in the Methodist Church, they are also \"received into full Connexion.\"\n\nMembership of the Methodist Church is held in a particular local church, or in a local ecumenical partnership. For people who wish to become members of the church there is a period of training and, once the local church council is satisfied with the person's sincere acceptance of the basis of membership of the Methodist Church, a service of confirmation and reception into membership is held; if they have not previously been baptised, the service will include baptism. , church members are dispersed over 4,512 local churches—unevenly distributed over a small number of large churches and a large number of small churches.\n\n\"Local church\" can refer to both the congregation and the building. It is the whole body of members of the Methodist Church linked with one particular place of worship. The concept of the local church is based on the original Methodist \"societies\" that existed within the Church of England during the time of John Wesley's ministry. A local church is normally led by a presbyter, usually referred to as \"the minister\".\n\nSome church members belong to a church council, either because they have been elected by the local church members, or because they hold one of a number of offices within the local church. The church council, with a minister, has responsibility for running the local church. Members of the church council are also trustees of the local church.\n\nLocal churches are grouped into 368 circuits () of various sizes. The responsibilities of the circuit are exercised through the circuit meeting, led by the superintendent minister. It is responsible for managing the finances, property and officeholders within the circuit. Most circuits have many fewer ministers than churches and the majority of services are led by local preachers, or by supernumerary ministers—retired ministers who are not officially counted in the number of ministers for the circuit in which they are listed. The superintendent and other ministers are assisted in the leadership and administration of the circuit by lay circuit stewards, who together form the leadership team.\n\nSome large inner-city churches, known as 'central halls', are designated as circuits in themselves. About a hundred such halls were built in Britain between 1886 and 1945, many in a Renaissance or Baroque style. They were designated as multi-purpose venues; in their heyday they presented low-cost concerts and shows to entertain the working classes on Saturdays, encouraging them to abstain from alcohol, as well as hosting church congregations on Sundays. However, many were bombed during the Second World War, and others declined as people moved out of the city centres; only sixteen remain in use as Methodist churches. Others, such as the landmark Birmingham Central Hall, and Liverpool's Grand Central Hall, have been sold and adapted as retail or nightclub venues. One of the remaining halls is Methodist Central Hall, located off Parliament Square in Westminster, established in 1912 to serve as a church with additional use \"for conferences on religious, educational, scientific, philanthropic and social questions\".\n\nThe Connexion is divided into thirty districts () covering the whole of Great Britain, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands. The district is a drawing together of a variable number of circuits in a geographic locality. Wales is covered by two districts: a Welsh-language synod and an English-language synod. Methodism has never been prevalent in Scotland and there are only around 40 local churches gathered into one Scotland District.\n\nThe governing body of a district is the twice-yearly synod. Each district is presided over by a chair, except the large London District which has three chairs. A chair was, at first, a superintendent of a circuit within the district, but now ministers are appointed exclusively to the role. The prime function of the chair is pastoral—the care of ministers, and lay workers, and their families, within the district; the appointment of ministers to circuits; candidates for the ministry and the oversight of probationer (trainee) ministers. The district chair is also the person to whom other denominations relate ecumenically at regional or national level.\n\nThe central governing body of the Connexion is the Methodist Conference which meets in June or July each year in a different part of the country. It represents both ministers and laypeople, and determines church policy. The conference is a gathering of representatives from each district, along with some who have been elected by the conference and some ex officio members and representatives of the youth assembly. It is held in three sessions, for the presbyterate, the diaconate and a representative session including lay representatives. The 2019 conference was held in Birmingham. The 2020 conference will take place as a virtual meeting due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Methodist Conference is the formal authority on all matters of belief and practice. Proposals for a change or development of Methodist teaching about personal, social or public Christian ethics can be initiated:\n\n\nIf, by methods 1 and 2 above, the proposed change or development is significant, the conference will usually direct the Methodist Council to look into the issues and to present a report at a subsequent Conference.\n\nIn the course of preparing the report, staff who are appointed or employed by the council will be responsible for developing the church's thinking with the help of professional and theological expertise; and must undertake a wide range of consultations, both within the Methodist Church and with partner denominations. Then the report, with or without specific recommendations, will be presented to Conference for debate.\n\nExamples of issues dealt with in this way are: abortion; civil disobedience; nuclear deterrence; the manufacture and sale of arms; disarmament; care of the environment; family and divorce law; gambling; housing; overseas development and fair trading; poverty; racial justice; asylum and immigration issues; human sexuality; political responsibility.\n\nSometimes the conference will attempt a definitive judgement on an important theme which is intended to represent the Methodist Church's viewpoint for a decade or more. In such cases a final decision is made after two debates in conference, separated by at least a year, to allow for discussion in all parts of the church's life. Topics of personal, social or public Christian ethics dealt with in this way become official \"Statements\" or \"Declarations\" of the Methodist Church on the subject concerned, for example, \"Family Life, the Single Person and Marriage\".\n\nThe Methodist Conference is presided over by the president of conference, a presbyter, (). The president is supported by the vice-president, who is a layperson or deacon. The president and vice-president serve a one-year term, travelling across the Connexion—following the example of Wesley—and preaching in local churches.\n\nThe \"Constitutional Practice and Discipline of the Methodist Church\" (CPD) is published annually by order of the conference. Its contents are prepared by the church's Law and Polity Committee and reviewed each year. Volume 1 contains a set of fixed texts, including Acts of Parliament, other legislation and historic documents; volume 2 includes the Deed of Union and Model Trusts, along with standing orders which are updated annually after amendments by the conference.\n\nThe Methodist Church is closely associated with several charitable organisations: namely, Action for Children (formerly the National Children's Home), Methodist Homes and All We Can (the Methodist Relief and Development Fund).\nThe church also helps to run a number of faith schools, both state and independent. These include two leading public schools in East Anglia, Culford School and The Leys School. It helps to promote an all round education with a strong Christian ethos.\n\nThe Methodist Church participates in various ecumenical forums and interdenominational associations. The church is a member of the three national ecumenical bodies in Great Britain, namely Churches Together in England, Cytûn in Wales and Action of Churches Together in Scotland, plus Churches Together in Britain and Ireland. The Methodist Church is also one of the Covenanted Churches in Wales, along with the Church in Wales, the Presbyterian Church of Wales, the United Reformed Church and certain Baptist churches. It participates in the Conference of European Churches and the World Council of Churches. The church has sent delegates to every Assembly of the World Council and has at various times been represented on its Central Committees and Faith and Order Commission.\n\nThe Methodist Church is officially committed to \"seek opportunities to work in partnership with other denominations\" and \"seek opportunities to join with other Christians in sharing the Good News of the Gospel and to make more followers of Jesus Christ through together bearing witness to the unity of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.\" From the 1970s onward, the Methodist Church has been involved in nearly 900 local ecumenical partnerships (LEPs) with neighbouring denominations, such as the Church of England, the Baptist Union and the United Reformed Church. Christ Church in Nelson, Lancashire, is a rare example of a joint Methodist–Catholic church in Britain.\n\nIn April 2016 the World Methodist Council opened an Ecumenical Office in Rome, Italy. Methodist leaders and Pope Francis met together to dedicate the new office. It exists to offer a resource in the city of Rome for the global Methodist family and to help facilitate Methodist relationships with the wider Christian Church, especially the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Methodist Church made ecumenical overtures to the Church of England, aimed at church unity. In February 1963, a report, \"Conversations between the Church of England and the Methodist Church\", was published. This gave an outline of a scheme to unite the two churches. The scheme was not without opposition, for four Methodist representatives; Kingsley Barrett, Meadley, Snaith and Jessop, issued a dissentient report. Through much of the 1960s, controversy spread in the two churches. Central in the debate was the need for Methodist ministers to be ordained under the Anglican historical episcopate, which opponents characterised as \"reordination\" of Methodist ministers.\n\nDiscussions failed when the proposals for union were rejected by the Church of England's General Synod in 1972 but were renewed in the mid-1990s, with a series of Informal Conversations held in 1995 and 1996. These meetings concluded with the publication of a common statement in December 2000 which highlighted common beliefs and potential areas of cooperation between the two denominations.\n\nIn 2002, the British Methodist Conference voted on the proposals in \"An Anglican–Methodist Covenant\", sending it to its districts for discussion. On 1 November 2003, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, the president and other leaders of the Methodist Conference and the leaders of the Church of England signed the covenant at Methodist Central Hall in Westminster. The covenant affirms the willingness of the two churches to work together at a diocesan/district level in matters of evangelism and joint worship.\nFollowing the submission of a report entitled \"Justice for Palestine and Israel\" in July 2010, the British Methodist Conference was reported to have questioned whether \"Zionism was compatible with Methodist beliefs\". Christian Zionism was broadly characterised as believing that Israel \"must be held above criticism whatever policy is enacted\", and Conference called for a boycott of selected goods from Israeli settlements. The Chief Rabbi of Britain's Orthodox Jewish community described the report as \"unbalanced, factually and historically flawed\" and charged that it offered \"no genuine understanding of one of the most complex conflicts in the world today. Many in both communities will be deeply disturbed.\"\n\nSt Andrew's Scots Church, Malta, is a joint congregation of the Methodist Church of Great Britain and the Church of Scotland situated in Valletta. There are also Methodist congregations in the Crown dependencies of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands (each forming a district).\n\nMethodist churches in Northern Ireland are part of the Methodist Church in Ireland, a separate Connexion which is historically associated with the British Methodist Church.\n\nMethodism is a worldwide movement with around 80.5 million adherents (including members of united and uniting churches). Its largest denomination is the United Methodist Church, which has congregations on four continents (though the majority are in the United States). Almost all Methodist denominations meet together every five years in a conference of the World Methodist Council, with its headquarters in Lake Junaluska, North Carolina.\n\n"}
{"id": "2036044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036044", "title": "Galaxiidae", "text": "Galaxiidae\n\nThe Galaxiidae are a family of mostly small freshwater fish in the Southern Hemisphere. The majority live in Southern Australia or New Zealand, but some are found in South Africa, southern South America, Lord Howe Island, New Caledonia, and the Falkland Islands. One galaxiid species, the common galaxias (\"Galaxias maculatus\"), is probably the most widely naturally distributed freshwater fish in the Southern Hemisphere. They are coolwater species, found in temperate latitudes, with only one species known from subtropical habitats. Many specialise in living in cold, high-altitude upland rivers, streams, and lakes.\n\nSome galaxiids live in fresh water all their lives, but many have a partially marine lifecycle. In these cases, larvae are hatched in a river, but are washed downstream to the ocean, later returning to rivers as juveniles to complete their development to full adulthood. This pattern differs from that of salmon, which only return to fresh water to breed, and is described as amphidromous.\n\nFreshwater galaxiid species are gravely threatened by exotic salmonid species, particularly trout species, which prey upon galaxiids and compete with them for food. Exotic salmonids have been recklessly introduced to many different land masses (e.g. Australia, New Zealand), with no thought as to impacts on native fish, or attempts to preserve salmonid-free habitats for them. Numerous localised extinctions of galaxiid species have been caused by the introduction of exotic salmonids, and a number of freshwater galaxiid species are threatened with overall extinction by exotic salmonids.\n\nAbout 50 species are in the family Galaxiidae, grouped into seven genera:\n\n\nGalaxiids are found around the south eastern seaboard of Australia and in some parts of south western Australia. The galaxiids and the temperate perches (Percichthyidae) are the dominant native freshwater fish families of southern Australia. Species common to all areas include:\n\nSouth east Australian mainland\n\nThreatened species are:\n\nWestern Australia\n\nTasmania\nFifteen species of galaxiids have been found in Tasmania. The most common species are:\n\nTasmanian endangered species include:\n\nTwenty-three species of galaxiids have been discovered in New Zealand, and prior to the introduction of non-native species such as trout, they were the dominant freshwater fish family. Most of these live in fresh water all their lives. However, the larvae of five species of the genus \"Galaxias\" develop in the ocean, where they form part of the zooplankton and return to rivers and streams as juveniles (whitebait), where they develop and remain as adults. All \"Galaxias\" species found in New Zealand are endemic, except for \"Galaxias brevipinnis\" (koaro) and \"Galaxias maculatus\" (inanga).\n\n\n\n\nThe juveniles of those galaxiids that develop in the ocean and then move into rivers for their adult lives are caught as whitebait while moving upstream and are much valued as a delicacy. Adult galaxiids may be caught for food, but they are generally not large. In some cases, their exploitation may be banned (e.g. New Zealand) unless available to indigenous tribes.\n\nIn addition to serious impacts from exotic trout species, Australian adult galaxiids suffer a disregard from anglers for being \"too small\" and \"not being trout\". This is despite the fact that several Australian galaxiid species, though smallish, grow to a sufficient size to be catchable and readily take wet and dry flies, and that one of these species — the spotted galaxias — was keenly fished for in Australia before the introduction of exotic trout species. A handful of fly-fishing exponents in Australia are rediscovering the pleasure of catching (and releasing) these Australian native fish on ultralight fly-fishing tackle.\n\n"}

Their purpose is to increase the reputation of the profession and to establish the profession as such in its own right.\n\nThere are different membership categories which one can apply to - membership fees are organized accordingly.\n\nVoting members are Fellow members, Professional members and Associate members. The Fellow members are members who are deemed to have excelled in contributing to the Architectural Lighting Design profession and to PLDA. Professional members are those who own an independent practice or work in an independent practice, and have a certain number of years of experience in lighting design. The same applies to Associate members, except their number of years' experience is less.\n\nNon-voting members are Design members (independent, but with little or no experience as an independent designer), Student members and Affiliate members.\nAffiliate members are those who are not full-time lighting designers, but are very interested in lighting design or need it for their profession.\n\nPLDA collaborates with other lighting associations, including CIE, IES and other groupings of lighting designers around the world.\nWith the Institution of Lighting Engineers, PLDA has a partnership agreement, in order to foster deeper understanding between the lighting profession and engineering practitioners.\n\nThe official magazine of the organization is the Professional Lighting Design, which is published by the VIA-Verlag. Every member receives the magazine automatically. The VIA-Verlag maintains very close ties with PLDA by, for example, organizing many events for the association.\n\nThe Professional Lighting Designers' Association believes that education is the key to establishing Lighting Design as a serious profession. The association thus dedicates a large portion of its time to the organisation and support of education programmes at university level. PLDA has an Educators' network. International educators meet on a regular basis. PLDA works closely with many universities around the world, for example at KTH in Stockholm/S, the Hochschule Wismar/D, Fachhochschule Hildesheim/D, Parson's New School of Design in NYC/USA and Bachelor and Masters programmes in many European countries.\n\nThe Workshop Programme with up to four major workshops a year gives students and young designers the opportunity to work in teams under the guidance of a professional lighting designer to develop and implement a lighting design concept on a real project. Some universities have these workshops in their curriculum.\n\nThe Professional Lighting Designers' Association stages the Light Focus conference once a year, usually in conjunction with a major lighting fair event, e.g. Light+Building in Frankfurt/D or Euroluce in Milan/I. The sessions cover topics of interest and relevance to all those involved in architectural lighting design and bring to light a variety of professional themes.\n\nThe Professional Lighting Designers' Association stages the Vox Juventa conference for young designers once a year. The winning speaker receives a money prize.\n\nPLDA, hosts a number of practical workshops, which are organized by the event management of VIA publishing, in which various lighting projects are carried out in areas of a selected town or city. In this way, the general public is educated and shown what lighting design means and that it can help to improve the urban nightscape.\n\nThe town of Alingsås, Sweden is the most regular partner. In 2009 PLDA and Alingsås celebrated their tenth year of working together.\n\nOthers have been carried out in Jyväskylä/FIN, Winterthur/CH, Birmingham/UK, Lüdenscheid/D, Liverpool/UK or Stavanger/N and Notodden/N.\n\nPolicy making for PLDA is handled the association's elected council:\n\n\n\n"}

It is famous for Textile in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It has been termed a 'textile city'.\n\nStone Age tools dating from 5,012 to 200,000 years were found in Bundi and Bhilwara districts of the state.\n\nAccording to substantiation, the present Bhilwara city had a mint where coins known as 'Bhiladi' were minted and from this denomination was derived the name of the district. And other story goes like this that a tribe known as Bheel helped Maharana Pratap in war against Mughal Empire king Akbar lived in Bhilwara region that's this area came to be known as Bheel+Bada (Bheel's area) Bhilwara. Over the years it has emerged out as one of the major cities of Rajasthan. Nowadays, Bhilwara is better known as the textile city in the country.\n\nThe oldest part of this town was set up in the middle of the 11th century by building a Krishna Radha mandir (temple) that still exists and is known as the Bada Mandir. The area that is now known as Purana Bhilwara (Patwari Mohalla, Junawas, Manikya Nagar Malikhera). There is also reference to Arjuna having fought here during the Mahabharata period.\n\nHistorical records show that a town named Mandal close to Bhilwara served as the military base for the Mughals when they had attacked Chittaurgarh. The ruins of their campsite can still be seen today. A watch tower that was built on a small mound in Mandal is now a Devi temple.\n\nBhilwara is located at . It has an average elevation of 421 metres (1381 feet). It falls between the districts of Ajmer (in north) and Chittorgarh and Udaipur (in south). Major rivers flowing through the district are Banas, Bedach, Kothari, Khari, Mansi, Menali, Chandrabhaga, and Nagdi.\n\nThere is no natural lake in the district but there are the number of ponds and dams so the district is the most irrigated in the state of Rajasthan.\n\n India census, Bhilwara has a population of 359,483. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. About 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nThe major industry is textiles, with more than 850 manufacturing units in the town. The main textile product is synthetic fabric used in trousers. It began with a spinning and knitting company named Mewar Textile Mills, owned by industrialist Shri Sampatmal Lodha, started in 1938. Thereafter Shri Laxmi Niwas Jhunjhunwala started his first unit for synthetic textile in 1961 at Bhilwara.\n\nNational Highway No. 79, part of the Golden Quardrilateral (four lane), and another National Highway No. 76 part of the East West Corridor (four-lane) pass through the district.

The Badoon Exfulgence are notable for living under strict gender segregation, resulting in two separate societies; the Brotherhood of Badoon (ruled by a \"Brother Royal\") and the Sisterhood of Badoon (ruled by a Queen).\n\nThe Brotherhood live on the planet Moord in the Lomora star system, in the Milky Way, while the Sisterhood reside on the Badoon homeworld of Lotiara (Capella II, also known as \"Swampworld\"), 42.2 light years from Earth.\n\nThe Badoon first appeared in \"Silver Surfer\" #2 and were created by Stan Lee and John Buscema.\n\nThe Badoon Exfulgence is older than the Kree and the Skrulls. There was a natural hatred between the two genders, and they fought each other in long gender wars. The males won and placed the weaker females in captivity. In time, the males further developed technology and abandoned Lotiara, returning only when their mating drive made it necessary. The males became conquerors of worlds, while the females became pacifists, content to remain in peace on their homeworld and ignorant of the males' star-spanning empire.\n\nAmong the Brotherhood's conquest attempts are the Zen Whoberi, the Spartax Empire, and the extra-dimensional world of Polemachus. They have been known to form alliances with the Brood (against the Shi'ar and Earth's superhumans), the Kree (against the Skrulls), and Byrrah of Atlantis. They were also responsible for killing a woman who would have become the universe's greatest peacemaker.\n\nBadoon invasion attempts of Earth have been overcome by the Silver Surfer, Namor, and the New Warriors. They were also opposed by the combined forces of the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and Arkon in order to liberate Arkon's homeworld and prevent an invasion of the Shi'ar empire.\n\nAt the time of the Annihilation Wave the Badoon Empire controlled 37.7% of the Milky Way Galaxy. Despite this, the Badoon are considered a minor species. The time traveler Major Victory warned the Guardians of the Galaxy that they need to take the Badoon seriously, as soon they'll become the greatest military threat in the galaxy.\n\nThe Inhumans and the Kree later form an alliance with the Badoon alongside the Centaurians, the Dire Wraiths, and the Kymellians. They were put through the same experimental procedure so that they cannot be harmed by the Terrigen Mists. The Badoons' procedure had them going through Amphogenesis upon injecting one drop of the diluted water from the dormant Amphogen (a mutagenic substance). The Badoons were present on Earth's moon upon Black Bolt's return and when the prophecy of the four cities is known.\n\nThe Badoon Exfulgence’s currency is the Kreull.\n\nThe Brotherhood are capable of faster-than-light space travel and also possess personal cloaking technology. They employ a hand-held particle gun called the \"basic weapon.\" Although males typically wear minimal clothing, some soldiers wear an explosive \"frag-thong\" that destroys approximately ten surrounding enemies once a Badoon is shot down.\n\nThere is also a large, muscular cyborg-like being sometimes used in personal combat called the Monster of Badoon. The Badoon will bolster their forces with Zom soldiers: the corpses of victims turned into cyborg warriors. They are known to use Saturnian Hound-Hawks in the 31st century.\n\n\nThe Brotherhood are most closely associated with the Guardians of the Galaxy's 'Multiverse' timeline of Earth-691. In this reality, Earth fought a war with them in the 30th century until both Earth and its solar system colonies were conquered in the year 3007, and many races were nearly all wiped out. The Guardians of the Galaxy were made up of different species, and put together by Starhawk. The human Michael Korvac, joined the Badoon and became a cyborg. The Solar System was liberated by the intervention of the Sisterhood in 3014. Almost all information about the Sisterhood comes from the Guardians of the Galaxy's encounters with them in this timeline.

As per all constituencies for the House of Commons in the modern age, each constituency elects one Member of Parliament by the First Past The Post system.\n\nThe most recent changes to Parliamentary constituencies by the Boundary Commission for England retain the 5 constituencies in Shropshire, making only small changes to the boundary between Telford and The Wrekin to align with current local government wards. These changes were implemented for the 2010 United Kingdom general election.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.\n\n\"Primary data source:\" House of Commons research briefing - General election results from 1918 to 2019\n\nThe number of votes cast for each political party who fielded candidates in constituencies comprising Shropshire in the 2019 general election were as follows:\n\nIncludes National Liberal Party up to 1966\n\n1950-1979 - Liberal; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Included in Other\n\nIncludes National Liberal Party up to 1966\n\n1950-1979 - Liberal; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\nTimeline of Parliamentary constituencies in the county, with historical (green) and extant (pink) constituencies.\n\nA cell marked → (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\n"}
{"id": "2036078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036078", "title": "Torksey", "text": "Torksey\n\nTorksey is a small village in the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 875. It is situated on the A156 road, south of Gainsborough and north-west of the city of Lincoln, and on the eastern bank of the tidal River Trent, which here forms the boundary with Nottinghamshire.\n\nIt is notable historically as the site of a Roman canal, a major Viking camp, the late medieval Torksey Castle and a Victorian railway bridge, Torksey Viaduct.\n\nFoss Dyke, a Roman canal constructed in or about the 2nd Century, joins the River Trent by way of a series of lock-gates about half a mile (800 m) south of the village.\n\nDuring the 9th Century, Torksey was part of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Lindsey. In the late 860s, a Viking invasion force known to the English as the \"Great Heathen Army\" conquered eastern England. In 871–2, the Vikings established a winter camp in London, but returned to Northumbria soon afterwards, following a rebellion against their rule. During 872–3, the Great Heathen Army established its winter quarters at Torksey.\n\nThe now Grade I listed 16th-century Torksey Castle was destroyed in August 1645 during the English Civil War; its remains are on the river side of the dike which separates it from dry land.\n\nThe Grade II* listed railway viaduct over the Trent remains but it is no longer in use.\n\nTorksey Viaduct has two spans across the River Trent. It was built between 1847 and 1849 to carry the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (Clarborough Junction-Sykes Junction branch). It is of unusual design and is regarded as the first box girder bridge. It was designed by John Fowler, who had been influenced by Fairbairn and Stephenson's tubular bridges at Conwy and the Menai Straits. The tubular girder bridge was not initially accepted by the Board of Trade's inspector Lintorn Simmons; this decision (and also the basic premise that a bridge designed by a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers which had passed all practical tests could be rejected by a railway inspector because he was uncomfortable with its novel design) was criticised by the ICE: \"The subject has been discussed in the Institution of Civil Engineers, and every eminent engineer was of the opinion that the Government inspector was clearly wrong\". Threatened with a call for a parliamentary enquiry should approval continue to be withheld, the Railway Inspectorate reconsidered and approved the bridge un-modified. Subsequently, and consequently, the Board of Trade took the view that (as it explained in defending itself from criticism that the defects in the Tay Bridge should have been seen and acted upon by the Railway Inspectorate): \"The duty of an inspecting officer, so far as regards design, is to see that the construction is not such as to transgress those rules and precautions which practice and experience have proved to be necessary for safety. If he were to go beyond this, or if he were to make himself responsible for every novel design, and if he were to attempt to introduce new rules and practices not accepted by the profession, he would be removing from the civil engineer, and taking upon himself a responsibility not committed to him by Parliament.\" \nTorksey bridge was strengthened in 1897 by adding a more conventional central truss above the deck rather than by strengthening the box.\n\nThe environmental charity Sustrans has carried out work on the viaduct in preparation for opening it as a walk/cycle-way They obtained planning permission in 2015 for the paths, which Sustrans aimed to link as a walking and cycling route to connect the quiet roads east of Torksey with those west of Cottam, a village about to the west. In April 2016, the viaduct was opened to both cyclists and walkers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2036080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036080", "title": "Hakluyt Society", "text": "Hakluyt Society\n\nThe Hakluyt Society is a text publication society, founded in 1846 and based in London, England, which publishes scholarly editions of primary records of historic voyages, travels and other geographical material. In addition to its publishing role, the Society organises and participates in meetings, symposia and conferences relating to the history of geographical exploration and cultural encounter. It is a registered charity and a non-profitmaking institution administered by a voluntary team of council members and officers. Membership is open to all with an interest in its aims.\n\nThe Society is named after Richard Hakluyt (1552–1616), a collector and editor of narratives of voyages and travels and other documents relating to English interests overseas.\n\nThe Society was created at a meeting convened in the London Library, St James's Square, on 15 December 1846. Under the chairmanship of the geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, it established an eight-man steering group which included the geographer and historian William Desborough Cooley; the Army medical officer Dr Andrew Smith; the naval officer and surveyor Sir Charles Malcolm; the antiquary Bolton Corney; the British Museum Principal Librarian Sir Henry Ellis; the physicist and mathematician William Rowan Hamilton, FRS; and John Edward Gray, Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum. Cooley had previously criticised the Royal Geographical Society for relying too heavily on contemporary materials in the solution of geographical problems, arguing that the scientific study of geography should involve a far wider analysis and appreciation of earlier sources. He took the major role during the Society's formative period, assisted by Corney and Smith, while Murchison occupied little more than a figurehead position.\n\nCooley had proposed that the society should be known as the \"Columbus Society\", but at the inaugural Council Meeting on 26 January 1847 it was decided that it be named in commemoration of Richard Hakluyt. Not only did Hakluyt's name as a recorder of voyages, rather than an explorer in his own right, better reflect the society's aims, but it also proclaimed its central ambition, which was to advance Hakluyt's work into the modern age. A resolution was adopted whereby the Society would print and circulate to its members, for a subscription of one guinea per annum, rare accounts of voyages, travels and geographical records dating from any period prior to William Dampier's circumnavigation (effectively before the end of the 17th century). Meetings were initially held in a room at the London Library, but in 1849 transferred to the offices of the Society's printer in St Martin's Lane, and from 1850 in Great Queen Street. From 1872 they were held at the Royal Geographical Society's premises, originally in Savile Row and subsequently in Kensington Gore.\n\nA General Meeting on 4 March 1847 agreed a constitution and a list of works to be published. The Society was to be governed by a President (Murchison), two Vice-Presidents (Charles Malcolm and Revd H. H. Milman), a Secretary (Cooley) and 17 elected council members. The first year's Council included – in addition to the members of the original steering group – Charles Darwin, Charles Beke, Captain Charles Ramsay Drinkwater Bethune and the scholar Richard Henry Major.\n\nThe Society attracted 220 members in its first two years. Its first publication, Bethune's \"Observations of Sir Richard Hawkins\", appeared in December 1847; followed by Major's \"Select Letters of Christopher Columbus\" (printed 1847 but published in January 1848). Richard Hakluyt's \"Divers Voyages touching the Discovery of America\", which the Society had intended for its inaugural publication, was postponed until 1850. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Schomburgk's edition of Ralegh's voyage to Guiana had appeared (1849), together with Cooley's \"Sir Francis Drake his Voyage\" (1849), Thomas Rundall's \"Voyages towards the North-West\", and Major's \"Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia\". Early print-runs were relatively small – around 250 copies to satisfy the existing membership, with a few to spare – at a cost to the Society in the region of £50–60.\n\nMurchison served as President until his death in 1871, although his position was largely honorary. He was succeeded by Sir David Dundas (1871–77), a lawyer and politician, and then by Sir Henry Yule (1877–89), an Oriental scholar and former East India Company soldier. Yule took a more direct interest in the editing of the society's publications than either Murchison or Dundas, and it was his decision that all future volumes should be indexed. R. H. Major, who had taken over as Secretary from Cooley in 1849, held the office until 1858 when his place was taken by the geographer, historian and expedition promoter Clements Markham. Markham served as Secretary 1858–87, and as President 1889–1909, and personally edited no fewer than 29 volumes. From 1893 he was assisted by William Foster, the East India Company historian and India Office archivist, who served as Secretary until 1902. The first permanent Treasurer, appointed in 1908, was Edward Heawood, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian: he remained in office for thirty-eight years.\n\nIn 1908, the final year of Markham's rule, the Society broke with tradition and published its first post-1700 text, Bolton Corney's \"Voyage of Captain Don Felipe Gonzalez\".\n\nIn 1909 Markham was succeeded as President by Sir Albert Gray, an ex-member of the Ceylon Civil Service. From this time onwards the Society began to extend its activity beyond that of publication. It supported the establishment of a memorial to Richard Hakluyt in Bristol Cathedral in 1911, and in 1914 Gray represented the Society on the British Academy Committee involved in organising the Shakespeare Tercentenary. The period also saw the emergence of women as editors and translators, notably Sigfus Blondal, Bertha Philpotts, Lavinia Anstey and Zelia Nuttall. Membership increased, largely on account of institutional subscriptions which by 1911 accounted for half of the 440 members. Sir William Foster, the former Secretary, served as President 1928–1945, and then as Vice-president until his death in 1951. Foster's skill in annotating rubbed off on his editors and resulted in a period distinguished by considerable improvements in the quality of the Society's publications, together with a steady growth in membership to more than 2000. Foster was succeeded in 1945 by Edward Lynam, Superintendent of the Map Room at the British Museum (now the British Library) and the first of a line of post-war presidents whose terms of office were restricted to a period of five years. In the post-war period the Society's publication programme benefited from the labours of those of its voluntary officers who also took on editorial responsibilities, including R. A. Skelton, Eila Campbell, Terence Armstrong, Sarah Tyacke, Michael Brennan, Robin Law and Will Ryan.\n\nThe main activity of the Society is the publication of scholarly editions of primary sources on the voyages and travels undertaken by individuals in many parts of the globe. These include early accounts dealing with the geography, ethnology and natural history of the regions visited. The Society has to date published over 200 editions in some 350 volumes. All editions are published in English.\n\nAlthough many of the Society's past editions relate to British ventures, with documentary sources in English, the majority concern non-British enterprises and are based on texts in languages other than English. Translations from Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French or Dutch have regularly appeared, and occasional translations from Russian, Greek, Latin, Amharic, Mandarin, Persian or Arabic. The translation in which the material is presented is normally a fresh version, but has sometimes been an earlier rendering, checked and corrected as necessary.\n\nAll editions contain scholarly annotation to elucidate the complexities of the text, and to place it in its wider historical context. Volumes are produced in a standard binding, and generally contain maps and contemporary illustrations. The Society's logo, which appears on the cover of all volumes, is a vignette of Ferdinand Magellan's ship, the \"Victoria\".\n\nEditions have dealt with the following explorers: Ibn Battuta, Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, Pedro Cieza de León, John Cabot, Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan, Cosmas Indicopleustes, James Cook, Vasco da Gama, Semyon Dezhnev, Francis Drake, Humphrey Gilbert, Jean-François de La Pérouse, Ludwig Leichhardt, Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, Ma Huan, Olaus Magnus, Arthur J. M. Jephson, Jens Munk, William of Rubruck, and George Vancouver.\n\nThe Society published 100 volumes in its First Series, from 1847 to 1899. The Second Series ran from 1899 to 1998, and accounted for 190 volumes. The Third Series, in a larger format, began in 1999, and by the end of 2016 had reached 31 volumes. These included a 3-volume journal of The Malaspina Expedition, published in association with the Museo Naval de Madrid.\n\nCurrently, two volumes are published on average each year.\n\nIn addition to its regular series, the Society publishes a separate Extra Series, comprising books which are too expensive in their production to be freely distributed, but which are made available to members at reduced prices. Publications of this type first appeared in 1903–07 with C. R. Beazley's annotated extracts from Hakluyt, and the multi-volume MacLehose editions of Hakluyt's \"Principal Navigations\" and Purchas's \"Pilgrimes\". These are now treated as volumes 1–33 of the Extra Series, although only a few sets of the MacLehose printings appeared in Hakluyt Society binding, and none carried the Extra Series imprint. The concept was revived and formally designated in the 1950s with the publication of the \"Journals of Captain James Cook\" (4 volumes, 1955–67, numbered as Extra Series vols 34–37), followed by other titles including the monumental \"Charts & Coastal Views of Captain Cook's Voyages\" (1988–92). The Extra Series had reached 47 volumes by the end of 2012.\n\nThe Society's Annual General Meeting and Annual Lecture is held at the Royal Geographical Society. Its website hosts a discussion group and publishes an online \"Journal of the Hakluyt Society\".\n\nA sister organisation, The American Friends of the Hakluyt Society, was founded in 1996 at the John Carter Brown Library located on the campus of Brown University. The American Friends was founded in conjunction with the 150th anniversary celebration of the Hakluyt Society. The Rhode Island merchant John Carter Brown (1797–1874), was the first American to join the Society as a charter member in 1846.\nThe American Friends of the Hakluyt Society exists as a non-profit corporation with objectives similar to those of the Hakluyt Society in London, but with a focus on the history of the Americas. The group promotes and helps provide financial support from the United States for the publication of scholarly editions of records of voyages, travels and other geographical material of the past.\n\n\n\n"}

This was the last series available on AGP cards.\n\nThe following features are common to all models in the GeForce 7 series except the GeForce 7100, which lacks GCAA:\n\nThe GeForce 7 supports hardware acceleration for H.264, but this feature was not used on Windows by Adobe Flash Player until the GeForce 8 Series.\n\nThe 7100 series was introduced on August 30, 2006 and is based on GeForce 6200 Series architecture. This series supports only PCI Express interface. Only one model, the 7100 GS, is available.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe 7100 series supports all of the standard features common to the GeForce 7 Series provided it is using the ForceWare 91.47 driver or later releases, though it lacks opencl/CUDA support, and its implementation of Intellisample 4.0 lacks GCAA.\n\nHowever it is important to note that 7100 series does not support technologies such as: high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and UltraShadow II.\n\nAlthough the 7300 LE was originally intended to be the \"lowest budget\" GPU from the GeForce 7 lineup, the 7100 GS has taken its place. As it is little more than a revamped version of the GeForce 6200TC, it is designed as a basic PCI-e solution for OEMs to use if the chipset does not have integrated video capabilities. It comes in a PCI Express Graphics Bus and up to 512MB DDR2 VRAM.\n\nPerformance specification\n\n\nThe 7200 series was introduced October 8, 2006 and is based on (G72) architecture. It is designed to offer a low-cost upgrade from integrated graphics solutions. This series supports only PCI Express interface. Only one model, the 7200 GS, is available.\n\nFeatures\n\nIn addition to the standard GeForce 7 Series features, the 7200 series supports the following features:\n\nHowever it is important to note that 7200 series does not support Scalable Link Interface (SLI).\n\nThe 7200 GS has the same memory speed as the 7300 GS, and the core frequency is the same as the 7300 LE. It has two pixel pipelines. Nvidia stated that the 7200 GS performance is 50% higher than the latest integrated graphics, it's the slowest card of the GeForce 7 Series and of the GeForce 6 Series but supports HDR and Nvidia PureVideo. NVIDIA GeForce 7200 GS desktop Graphics Processing Unit was launched in January 2006. The GPU uses Second Generation CineFX Shading architecture, and it is manufactured on 90 nm technological process. The card's graphics frequency is 450 MHz. It also has 2 pixel shaders, 4 texture units, together with 2 ROPs. The GeForce 7200 GS embeds 256 MB of DDR2 memory, utilizing 64 bit bus. The memory is clocked at 400 MHz, which results in 6.4 GB/s memory bandwidth. The GPU supports PCI Express 1.0 interface, and needs a single motherboard slot.\n\nNvidia designed the 7300 series to be entry level gaming video cards. Four models were available: the 7300 GT, the 7300 GS, the 7300 LE, and the 7300 SE.\n\nThis series was released to replace the older Geforce 6200 series.\n\nFeatures\n\nIn addition to the standard GeForce 7 Series features, the 7300 series supports following advanced features:\n\nIt uses the same core frequency and memory speed as the 7300 LE, and has two vertex and pixel shaders. In many ways, this card is actually inferior to the 7100 GS, although it still retains the HDR support.\n\nThe 7300 LE (LE stands for \"light edition\") is a scaled-down version of the 7300 GS. It has DDR2 memory, and a slightly lower core clock speed (450 MHz vs. 550 MHz). It is only available in the PCI Express interface. ASUS have produced a 7300 series card based on the 7300 LE core, running it at 580 MHz rather than 450 MHz.\n\nCard with the highest core clock speed of the 7300 series. Better performance than the 7300SE/LE.\n\nCard with the 128-bit memory interface and the highest memory bandwidth, but slightly lower 3D vertex rendering.\n\nThe GeForce 7500 LE is an OEM GPU and is like the 7300 GS based on the G72 core. It has either 128 MB or 256 MB of dedicated video memory, however it also supports TurboCache, giving it up to 512 MB of video memory. It has DDR2 type memory and uses 64-bits memory interface. The card also has 550 MHz core clock speed and 263 MHz or 324 MHz memory clock speed (526 MHz or 648 MHz effective).\n\nNvidia announced immediate availability of the GeForce 7600 series on March 9, 2006. Currently, two Models are available and these are GeForce 7600 GT and 7600 GS. This series is available with AGP and PCI-Express interfaces, covering a wide range of market segments.\n\nThis series was released to replace the older GeForce 6600 series.\n\nFeatures\n\nIn addition to the standard GeForce 7 Series features, the 7600 series supports following advanced features:\n\nOn March 22, 2006, Nvidia announced the immediate availability of the GeForce 7600 GS GPU targeted at the low-mid end. This new GPU assumed the place of the GeForce 6600 GT, which had been around for quite some time.\n\nThe AGP version was introduced on July 21, 2006. According to Nvidia, this card is identical to the PCI-e version other than the interface. In addition, the AGP version uses Nvidia's AGP-PCIe bridge chip.\n\nPreliminary testing showed that the GeForce 7600 GS outperforms a GeForce 6600 GT and ATI's counterpart, the ATI Radeon X1600 Pro.\n\nThis is the high-mid range product in the 7 Series family.\n\nThe 7600 contains all the features of the GeForce 7 family. It was made to provide a Geforce 7 series card to the mass market. Some companies released AGP versions. It incorporates memories (ddr3).\n\nThe GeForce 7650GS was limited to a few OEM cards only. Not much is known about this card, other than that it uses the 80 nm process.\nThe 7800 series was designed to deliver exceptional performance and was targeted towards high-end market segment. This series was discontinued and replaced with the 7900 series in early 2006.\n\nA total of 4 models were available: GeForce 7800 GTX 512, GeForce 7800 GTX, GeForce 7800 GT, and GeForce 7800 GS.\n\nFeatures\n\nIn addition to the standard GeForce 7 Series features, the 7800 series supports following advanced features:\n\nThe GeForce 7800 GT is the second GPU in the series, launched on August 11, 2005 with immediate retail availability. It has 20 pixel pipelines, 7 vertex shaders, 16 ROPs and a 400 MHz core clock, 500 MHz memory clock (1 GHz effective) using GDDR3 memory.\n\nThe GeForce 7800 GT had been introduced as a more affordable alternative to the 7800 GTX. At the time it was considered the performance/cost champion of video cards.\n\nOn February 2, 2006, Nvidia announced the 7800 GS as the first AGP video card in the GeForce 7 series lineup, an AGP version of the high-end GeForce 7 Series.\n\nThis card was promoted by several hardware enthusiasts as \"the last high-ended AGP card in existence\". It has 16 pixel shader units instead of the 20 that the 7800 GT has, but still benefits from the optimizations of the other 7-series GPUs enjoy. Clock speeds are 375 MHz for the GPU and 1200 MHz for the (GDDR3) memory. According to all benchmark tests, the performance of this card is faster than the GeForce 6800 GT and GeForce 6800 Ultra. Different vendors may deviate from the stated specification. It serves to provide a great upgrade path for those with high-end AGP systems who don't want to switch to a new high-end PCI-Express system.\nThere was a special \"Golden Sample\" release from Gainward that was called \"7800 GS+\" or officially \"Bliss 7800 GS 512 MB GS+\" that had default clock speeds of 450 MHz core and 1250 MHz memory. Unlike a standard 7800 GS, the 7800 GS+ actually used a 7900 GT GPU that had the full 24 pixel shaders instead of the regular 16 pixel shaders that are normally found on a 7800 GS video card.\n\nGainward had previously released a \"Bliss 7800 GS 512MB GS\" card that was based on a 7800 GT but utilized the AGP bus. Its external appearance and name make it nearly indistinguishable from the 7900 GT-based Bliss 7800 GS 512MB GS+. Leadtek produced a similar card with 256MB memory.\n\nIn late 2006 Gainward released a third '7800 GS' card with 20 pixel shaders running at 500 MHz core and 1400 MHz memory called the \"BLISS GS-GLH\". This card is also based on the 7900 GS core.\n\nThe GeForce 7800 GTX (codenamed G70, and previously NV47) was the first GPU in the series, launched on June 22, 2005 with immediate retail availability. The GeForce 7800 GTX supported the highest specification DirectX 9 vertex and pixel shaders, at the time: Version 3.0. It was natively a PCI Express chip. SLI support had been retained and improved from the previous generation.\n\nAccording to PC World, the 7800 GTX was \"one of the most complex processors ever designed\". The GPU had 302 million transistors (the Athlon 64 X2 4800+ CPU has 233.2 million transistors), along with 24 pixel and 8 vertex shaders. It was succeeded by the 7900 GTX on March 9, 2006.\n\nThe 512 MB version of the GeForce 7800 GTX was released on November 14, 2005. The card features more than simply an increased frame buffer from 256 MB to 512 MB. The card features a much improved core clock speed of 550 MHz vs. 430 MHz (27.9% increase) and fast 1.1 ns GDDR3 memory clocked at 1.7 GHz vs. 1.2 GHz (41.7% increase), when compared to the original version. Like ATI's X1800 XT, the addition of another 256 MB of memory, and to a lesser extent, the increased clock speeds, have raised the heat and power output significantly. To combat this, the GeForce 7800 GTX 512 sports a much larger yet quieter dual slot cooling solution when compared to the original 256 MB version.\n\nNvidia officially announced availability of the GeForce 7900 series on March 9, 2006.\n\nNvidia's 7900 series is a product refresh and not a new generation of Nvidia's GPU, running at 650 MHz. Officially, this series was meant to support only PCI Express Interface but some companies released AGP versions.\n\nA total of 5 models have been developed and are available: 7900 GX2, 7900 GTX, 7900 GT, 7900 GTO and 7900 GS.\n\nFeatures\n\nIn addition to the standard GeForce 7 Series features, the 7900 series supports following advanced features:\n\nIntroduced during the fall of 2006, At a MSRP of US$199, the 7900 GS filled the gap between the mid-end GeForce 7600 GT and the high-end GeForce 7900 GT. The card was unofficially launched August 23 by woot! as a white box OEM. However, the product's company, MSI, made claims that these cards were stolen from MSI during transportation and sold to woot!. The referenced MSI customer notice has been changed to remove explicit references to woot!. As of March 2007, Nvidia had discontinued production of a number of GeForce 6 and 7 series products, including the 7900 GS.\n\nThe GeForce 7900 GS has 20 pixel processors, 7 vertex processors, 256-bits memory bus, and comes clocked at approximately 450 MHz/1320 MHz for core/memory, which should provide slightly lower performance than the 7900 GT. The GeForce 7900 GS is powered by the graphics chip code-named G71, thus, shares the same advantages as the G71 did over its immediate predecessor G70: dual-link DVI outputs, reduced power consumption, higher performance.\n\nThis video card was released on March 9, 2006. Like the 7900 GTX, it uses the G71 GPU that is produced at 90 nm. It too offers all the features of the 7800 series as well as an attractive performance-to-price ratio.\n\nThe GeForce 7900 GTX is a 90 nm produced G70 (named G71) and features all the same features of the 7800 GTX but is built upon the smaller manufacturing process. Due to shortages of memory modules for the 512 MB GTX, more readily available 1600 MHz memory was used.\n\nThe 7900 GTO is a close cousin of the 7900 GTX. The GTO first arrived at a handful of retailers around October 1, 2006. At the time of launch, GTO boards sold for around US$250, compared to the 7900 GTX boards that cost in excess of $400 at the time. The GTO was essentially identical to the GTX, with the exception that it lacked HDCP and VIVO support, had underclocked memory running at 1320 MHz, and used tighter memory timings. Other than that, the two boards were identical: same PCB, same cooler, same GPU. The GTO used extremely fast 1.1ns Samsung BJ11 GDDR3 memory running at 1.8V, as opposed to the 2.1V it is rated at. Clock speeds on the two cards are identical, at 650 MHz. At stock memory speeds, most comparisons found the GTO to lag behind the GTX by roughly a 5-10% margin.\n\nThe majority of owners find that their GTO will overclock to 1600 MHz memory speeds, despite the under-volted RAM. Many flash their GTO to a GTX BIOS to officially make it a GTX. GTO owners having trouble reaching GTX speeds with BIOS version 5.71.22.39.13 or newer are advised to simply flash to an older BIOS version such as 5.71.22.39.08, this seems to solve overclocking problems for most users.\n\nThe GTO was an extremely popular card among enthusiasts as it offered near GTX performance at a considerably lower price. It was a limited production card aimed at cleaning out G70 inventories before the release of the G80, and only spent about a month in retail channels before selling out.\n\nThe GeForce 7900 GX2 is two videocards stacked to fit as a dual slot solution. This is not like products such as the ASUS Dual GeForce 7800 GT or nVidia's own 7950 GX2, where two GPUs are on the same card. This enables quad-SLI on two PCI Express x16 slots. Other OEM companies have access to the GX2 and it is available from numerous vendors.\n\nThe card features a 500 MHz GPU and 1200 MHz effective RAM speed. Although the power of the GX2 is less than the 7900 GTX, each card is more powerful than the 7900 GT.\n\nMany issues in this implementation of a dual-GPU unit convinced Nvidia to restrict its sale to OEM companies. The card is extremely long, with only the largest e-ATX cases being able to hold it. Two of the cards operating in quad-SLI also required extremely well designed airflow to function, and demanded a 1000 watt power supply unit.\n\nGeForce 7950 Series is the last addition in the GeForce 7 series. Officially, this series was meant to support only PCI Express Interface but some companies released AGP versions.\n\nTwo models are available: 7950 GT and 7950 GX2.\n\nFeatures\n\nIn addition to the standard GeForce 7 Series features, the 7950 series supports following advanced features:\n\nOn September 14, 2006 Nvidia released the 7950GT. Announced with a 550 MHz core clock, 700 MHz (1400 MHz effective) memory clock, 24 pixel shader units, standard configurations come equipped with both 512 MB GDDR3 memory and HDCP support. At an introductory price of US$300, the GeForce 7950 GT replaces the older GeForce 7900 GT and improves performance: the GeForce 7950 GT has a fillrate of 13,200 Megatexels/s and a memory bandwidth of 44.8 GB/s (versus 10800 Megatexels/s and 940 Megavertices/s for the 7900 GT).\n\nThis is essentially a dual-GPU video card that takes up only a single PCIe x16 slot, allowing for 4 GPUs to run with only two PCIe x16 slots, in standard SLI motherboards. Unlike the 7900 GX2 before it, this version is available to consumers directly.\n\nThe 7950 GX2 was released to retail on June 5, 2006, and shares similar specs to the GeForce 7900 GX2, with 500 MHz GPU clock, and 1200 MHz effective RAM speed. 512 MB of memory per GPU, for a total of 1 GB, however total performance is more in line with 512 MB since each GPU can only access its own memory and not the memory of the other one. It does not offer any advantages over single-GPU cards with 512 MB, memory wise.\n\nThis card is designed for the DIY market; it addresses many problems which the previous 7900 GX2 had suffered from, such as noise, size, power consumption, and price. The 7950 GX2 requires only a single PCIe power connector, in contrast to the twin-connectors of its predecessor; technically, this is understandable, as there is no need for a ring bus configuration – frames need only be passed on to the primary GPU. It is much shorter, fitting easily in the same space as a 7900 GTX. Lesser board layout and the removal of cooling vents on the bracket have greatly reduced temperatures, allowing the fans to run at a lower speed, thereby lowering noise. As of September 2006, the board can be found for $299, half the cost of a 7900 GX2.\n\nAccording to some review sites (such as Tom's Hardware - see above), a single 7950GX2 draws less power than a single ATI Radeon X1900 XT – some consider this an amazing feat considering the GX2 employs a pair of GPUs, when the Radeon uses only one. Other review sites say that a GX2 is quieter than the aforementioned Radeon, despite the GX2 boasting a pair of identical GPU coolers – however 'loudness' is highly subjective without the proper tools and testing conditions. If true, this would make a pair of GX2 cards cooler, quieter, and less power hungry than a pair of X1900 XT cards in CrossFire. However, there is no appreciable performance gain from pairing two 7950 GX2 cards in most applications, while dual X1900 XT configurations see large performance boosts in CrossFire mode.\n\nOn August 9, 2006, Nvidia released initial ForceWare 91.45 drivers for Windows 2000 and XP that support Quad SLI. The Quad SLI support was soon merged in with the normal WHQL driver package, when ForceWare 91.47 drivers was released on October 16, 2006.\n\nNvidia has not only targeted the desktop market but also the notebook market with the GeForce 7 series.\n\nFeatures\n\nIn addition to the standard GeForce 7 Series features, the GeForce Go 7 series supports following advanced features:\n\n\nThe GeForce Go 7 GPU series line-up consists of following models:\n\n\nNVIDIA has ceased driver support for GeForce 7 series, saying that \"GeForce 6-series and GeForce 7-series GPUs will be moved to legacy support after GeForce R304 drivers (304.xx to 309.xx). GeForce R310 drivers will not support these products.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Around 1418, while exploring the coast of Africa, he and João Gonçalves Zarco were taken off course by bad weather, and came upon an island which they called Porto Santo (Holy Harbor). Shortly after, they were ordered by Prince Henry to settle the island, together with Bartolomeu Perestrelo. Following a rabbit outbreak that made it difficult to grow crops, they moved to the nearby island of Madeira. It proved to be hospitable and cultivable, so Prince Henry sent for more settlers to colonize the island. The governance of Madeira was divided between Zarco and Tristão, who were appointed Captain-majors (\"capitães-donatários\") of Funchal and Machico, respectively. Tristão was officially designated to the post in May 11, 1440.\n\nTristão Vaz took part in further raids and explorations along the coast of Africa throughout his life. He died at Silves, at an advanced age.\n"}
