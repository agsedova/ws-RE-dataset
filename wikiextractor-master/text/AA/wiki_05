The agency ceased to exist separately on 1 April 2008 when it became part of Land and Property Services, an executive agency of the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel, along with the Rate Collection Agency, the Valuation and Lands Agency, and the Land Registry.\n\nIt was an Executive Agency within the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the Northern Ireland Executive. \n\nThe Ordnance Surveys of Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland share a common heritage: the British Ordnance Survey (OS) ceased to map Ireland just before the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 (the Partition of Ireland having already taken place in May 1921 with the creation of Northern Ireland). The new Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland (OSNI) officially came into existence on 1 January 1922, while the new Ordnance Survey of Ireland (OSI) came into being slightly later, on 1 April 1922.\n\nThe vast majority of OSNI's income came from the licensing of its digital mapping data, which, because of the long history of mapping in Ireland (see Ordnance Survey) is amongst the most detailed and comprehensive in the world. \nDigital products range from the Large Scale (1:1250 urban and 1:2500 rural) vector database, 1:10,000 raster mapping derived automatically from the L/S vector, 1:50,000 and 1:250,00 vectors, 1;10,000 orthophotography, 1:25,000 leisure maps, the 1:50,000 raster series, 1:250,000 Ireland North raster, street maps of the main conurbations, as well as paper derivatives of all the raster products.\n\nIn 2005 OSNI began, with the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI), to digitise the complete set of historical maps dating back to the 1830s. (The earliest comprehensive and accurately surveyed large scale mapping in the world). These are being georectified to match modern mapping projections and are being annotated with points of interest from PRONI's archives.\n\nOSNI also maintained the UK's only common address database, Pointer, which cross matches and validates the address data from the Royal Mail, Valuation and Lands Agency, OSNI and local authorities, and georeferences each address, as well as giving it a unique identifier. This allows spatial interrogation by customers of the >800,000 addresses in NI using computerised Geographic Information Systems (GIS) combined with digital mapping and the customer's own data. \n\nSupporting the interconnectivity of Geographical Information (GI) for the benefit of the Northern Ireland economy, society and administration was OSNI's primary purpose. In support of this, OSNI also provides the secretariat for Mosaic, the GI strategy for Northern Ireland, which is the first such strategy to be implemented in the UK. In support of Mosaic, OSNI is currently (2006) building a GeoHub for the region, which will be able to host and connect to spatial data from multiple sources, permit a metadata (data about the data) search and, using thin client browser applications, via the Internet, permit multiple data layers to be interrogated, connected, analysed, licensed, downloaded, uploaded and updated.\n\nStarting in Spring 2006, OSNI's own full product range is available via a map-enabled e-commerce website at www.osni.gov.uk\nOSNI's surveying technology is based on both photogrammetry and ground survey using total station electronic theodolites in combination with pen (tablet) computers, so that the data is updated directly into the digital format. The photogrammetry (using flight-derived stereoimagery at high resolution) is also used to maintain height models of the topography (Digital Terrain Model or DTM). Computer software permits the draping of aerial photography and/or mapping over such models for the purposes of fly-through or drive-through 3D visualisations.\nOSNI's Geodesy section maintains the positional reference system to millimetre precision and OSNI's ground stations allow high accuracy use of the GPS system.\n\n\n"}

According to \"Boston\" magazine, \"Its 16 miles of blacktop run from gritty industrial zones to verdant suburbia, passing gentrified brownstones, college campuses and bustling commercial strips.\"\n\nThe street begins in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester and runs southeast-northwest through Boston, paralleling Interstate 93 for a short distance and interchanging with the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90). It crosses the Charles River from the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston into the city of Cambridge via the Harvard Bridge, where it bisects the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, passes through Central Square, and curves around two sides of Harvard Yard at Harvard Square. After Harvard Square it turns sharply northward, passes Harvard Law School, then passes through Porter Square, where it bears northwestward. It continues through North Cambridge, Arlington, and Lexington, where it enters the Minuteman National Historical Park.\n\nThe road, by the same name, continues northwest and west, through many different cities and towns. It largely parallels or joins Route 2 and Route 2A, all the way into central Massachusetts, with a few gaps at towns that have different names for the central road.\n\nFor much of its length, Massachusetts Avenue is a center of commercial activity, especially through the larger towns. Apartments, shops, and restaurants fill both sides of it, and there is a lot of pedestrian traffic.\n\nA number of linear parks cut across various portions of Mass. Ave., including the Southwest Corridor Park, the Commonwealth Avenue portion of the Emerald Necklace, the Charles River Bike Path, the Cambridge Linear Park, Alewife Brook Reservation, and the Minuteman Bikeway.\n\n\n\nOn the night of April 18–19, 1775, Paul Revere rode his horse down a portion of this road (then known as the Great Road) on his \"Midnight Ride\". On April 18–19, 1775, William Dawes and Samuel Prescott also rode on portions of this road on their way to Concord. (These travels were on the Cambridge side of the Charles River; the Harvard Bridge was not constructed until the 1880s.)\n\nMassachusetts Avenue was formed at the end of the nineteenth century from what were separate roads. In Boston the road was previously called East Chester Park south of Chester Square and West Chester Park to the north (Chester Square is in the South End and is now called Chester Park). Across the river in Cambridge the road follows part of what was once Front Street near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then follows the former Main Street to Harvard Square (Main Street originally ran between Kendall and Harvard Squares, and the part to the east of Central Square retains the original name). From Harvard Square to the Arlington line at Alewife Brook it follows what had been North Avenue since 1838, and prior to that the Road to Menotomy. In Arlington it follows the former Arlington Avenue, and in Lexington it follows the former Main Street south of the Battle Green and the former Monument Street north of the Battle Green.\n\nMassachusetts Avenue is served with direct connections for a number of the MBTA's bus and subway routes between Lexington and Boston.\n\nDirect bus connections on Mass Ave include: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , a stop on the Silver Line bus, and LexPress.\n\nMBTA subway stations, from west to east, include: Porter, Harvard, and Central along the Red Line; both the Hynes Convention Center and Symphony along the Green Line; and a station along the Orange Line under the Mass Ave. name. An additional stop at Arlington Center was mooted during the 1980s Red Line extension but ultimately was not constructed.\n\nTwo MBTA Commuter Rail stations are located on Massachusetts Avenue, Porter in Cambridge and Newmarket at the South Bay Shopping Center in Dorchester.\n\n\n"}

Its Kazinczy Street facade has a rose window and narrow Gothic windows. The synagogue has three aisles. The women's balcony is supported by slim iron pillars decorated with Gothic Revival and Neo-Byzantine elements. The painting of the walls feature ornamental Eastern design.\n\nWhen designing the synagogue, Förster made some innovations: he had an organ built and the Torah reader's platform was put before the Ark, not in the centre of the synagogue. These innovations were rejected by the Orthodox majority of the city's Jews, and in the year following the opening of the synagogue a rabbinical assembly in Sátoraljaújhely excommunicated the rabbi of Miskolc. The Jewish citizens of Miskolc decided to remove the organ from the synagogue and put the platform in the centre, in accord with tradition.\n\nThis event led to a split in the Jewish community, and the local Hasidim (\"Sefardim\") separated from the rest, building a small place of worship in Kölcsey street, which no longer survives.\n\nAnother synagogue built in 1817, in Pálóczy Street, was demolished in 1963.\n\nAccording to the 1920 census, Miskolc had about 10,000 Jewish residents (16.5% of the total population) but the majority of them fell victim to The Holocaust. At the Déryné Street entrance to the synagogue are marble tablets commemorating that tragic event. Another commemorative plaque can be seen in János Arany Street, where the ghetto once was.\n\nAs of 2001, the city has about 500 Jewish residents.\n\n"}

Businesses in the poverty industry often include payday loan centers, pawnshops, rent-to-own centers, casinos, liquor stores, lotteries, tobacco stores, credit card companies, and bail-bond services. Illegal ventures such as loansharking might also be included. The poverty industry makes roughly US$33 billion a year in the United States. In 2010, elected American federal officials received more than $1.5 million in campaign contributions from poverty-industry donors.\n\nIn poorer countries, the poverty industry exploits the bottom of the pyramid and its extent can at times be used as a litmus test to assess the effectiveness of philanthropic poverty-alleviation initiatives. In some cases, the poverty industry directly takes advantage of philanthropic poverty-alleviation initiatives (e.g. formal, government-supported microfinance). For example, some moneylenders misrepresent themselves as formal microfinance initiatives or obtain loans from formal microfinance initiatives through deception. They on-lend these loans to micro-entrepreneurs (informal intermediation).\n\n\n"}

Its ruins are located north of the modern town Tekirova in the Kemer district of Antalya Province in Turkey. It lies between the Bey Mountains and the forests of Olympos National Park, south of the tourist town of Kemer and on the 57th kilometre of the Antalya–Kumluca highway. Phaselis and other ancient towns around the shore can also be accessed from the sea by daily yacht tours.\n\nThe town was set up by the Rhodians in 700 BC. Because of its location on an isthmus separating two harbours, it became the most important harbour city of eastern Lycia and an important centre of commerce between Greece, Asia, Egypt, and Phoenicia, although it did not belong to the Lycian League. The city was captured by Persians after they conquered Asia Minor. Cimon, in 468 BC, attacked the city and it was enrolled in the Delian Confederacy. Later it was captured by Alexander the Great.\n\nAfter the death of Alexander, the city remained in Egyptian hands from 209 BC to 197 BC, under the dynasty of Ptolemaios, and with the conclusion of the Apamea treaty, was handed over to the Rhodian Peraia, together with the other cities of Lycia. From 190 BC to 160 BC it remained under Rhodeian hegemony, but after 160 BC it was absorbed into the Lycian confederacy under Roman rule. Phaselis, like Olympos, was under constant threat from pirates in the 1st century BC, and the city was even taken over by the pirate Zekenites for a period until his defeat in 77 or 76 BC by the Romans under Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus. In 42 BC Brutus had the city linked to Rome. In the 3rd century AD, the harbor fell under the threat of pirates once again. So it began to lose importance, suffering further losses at the hands of Arab ships, until totally impoverished in the 11th century. When the Seljuqs began to concentrate on Alanya and Antalya as ports, Phaselis ceased to be a port of any note.\n\nThere was a temple of Athene at Phaselis, where the lance of Achilles was exhibited. It was the birthplace of the poet and orator Theodectes. It was also renowned for its roses, from which the essence was extracted.\n\nPhaselis became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Mira, the capital of the Roman province of Lycia. Its bishop Fronto took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451. His successor, Aristodemus, was one of the signatories of the letter that in 458 the bishops of Lycia sent to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian concerning the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. The bishop of the time of the Second Council of Nicaea (787) did not attend, and the acts were signed in his name by a deacon called Ioannes.\n\nNo longer a residential bishopric, Phaselis is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\n\nPhaselis has three harbours: the 'Northern Harbour', the 'Battle Harbour' and the 'Protected (Sun) Harbour', of which the last is the most important today. A 24-metre-wide ancient street runs through the middle of the city. The 'Hadrian Waterway Gate' is on the southern part of the street. There are ruins of shops and stores on the sides of the street and near these are ruins of public places such as Roman baths, agoras and theatres. These structures are dated to the 2nd century BC. There are water canals between the town centre and the 70 m plateau. There are also numerous sarcophagi.\n\n"}

The fulminate ion, , is a pseudohalic ion because its charge and reactivity are similar to those of the halogens. Due to the instability of the ion, fulminate salts are friction-sensitive explosives. The best known is mercury(II) fulminate, which has been used as a primary explosive in detonators. Fulminates can be formed from metals, such as silver and mercury, dissolved in nitric acid and reacted with ethanol. The weak single nitrogen-oxygen bond is responsible for their instability. Nitrogen very easily forms a stable triple bond to another nitrogen atom, forming nitrogen gas.\n\nFulminates were discovered by Edward Charles Howard in 1800. The use of fulminates for firearms was first demonstrated by a Scottish minister, A. J. Forsyth, who patented his scent-bottle lock in 1807; this was a small container filled with fulminate of mercury. Joshua Shaw determined how to encapsulate them in metal to form a percussion cap, but did not patent his invention until 1822.\n\nIn the 1820s, the organic chemist Justus Liebig discovered silver fulminate (AgCNO) and Friedrich Wöhler discovered silver cyanate (AgOCN). They have different properties but the same chemical composition, which led to a bitter dispute finally resolved by Jöns Jakob Berzelius through the concept of isomers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1796571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796571", "title": "Frank Stapleton", "text": "Frank Stapleton\n\nFrancis Anthony Stapleton (born 10 July 1956 in Dublin) is an Irish former football player and manager. He is best remembered for his time at Arsenal, Manchester United and as a pivotal player for the Republic of Ireland. He has also been manager at Bradford City and MLS club New England Revolution.\n\nStapleton was a distinguished centre forward, once touted as being amongst the best in the world in his position, who was an exceptionally strong header of the ball. He started his career with Arsenal, joining them in 1972 as an apprentice, after being turned down by Manchester United. He made his first-team debut in 1975 against Stoke City, and would go on to form a potent striking partnership with Malcolm Macdonald; the two scored 46 goals between them in 1976–77. He was Arsenal's top scorer for the three following seasons, and helped the Gunners reach a trio of FA Cup finals; Stapleton scored one of the goals in Arsenal's 1979 FA Cup Final 3–2 win over Manchester United, and scored 108 goals in 300 appearances in total for the Gunners.\n\nStapleton went on to move to Manchester United in the summer of 1981 for £900,000 (a fee set by tribunal after the two clubs could not agree) as new manager Ron Atkinson began building a team capable of challenging for silverware after a disappointing 1980-81 season under Dave Sexton. He helped United win the 1983 and 1985 FA Cups. It was in the first of those finals, when he scored against Brighton, in which Stapleton made history by becoming the first man to score for two different clubs in FA Cup Finals.United finished in the top four of the league in each of Stapleton's first five seasons at Old Trafford, and came close to winning a league title medal in the 1985-86 season after United won their first 10 league games of the season before their form slumped and they finished fourth. Atkinson was sacked and replaced by Alex Ferguson in November 1986, and Stapleton remained a regular member of the first team under the new manager, but he left at the end of the season to sign for Ajax Amsterdam, before returning to England soon afterwards to sign for Derby County, later joining Blackburn Rovers, Aldershot, Huddersfield Town (as player-coach) and Bradford City, where he spent three seasons after a brief period at Le Havre in France. \n\nAfter three seasons as player-manager at Bradford, he was sacked following their narrow failure to qualify for the Division Two playoffs at the end of the 1993-94 season. He then had a brief spell at Brighton & Hove Albion in the 1994–95 season, playing two games before finally announcing his retirement as a player.\n\nHe also won 71 caps for the Republic of Ireland, scoring a then record 20 goals. Stapleton made his international debut under then player-manager Johnny Giles in a friendly against Turkey in Ankara in 1976 at 20 years of age. He scored after only three minutes of his debut when he headed home a Giles free-kick at the near post. That friendly international finished 3–3 and marked the start of a magnificent international career for the quiet and reserved Stapleton.\n\nStapleton was committed to international football insisting that an \"international release clause\" be inserted to all of his contracts so that he could be released to play in international games for Ireland.\n\nStapleton played a significant role in Ireland's attempt to qualify for the World Cup in Spain in 1982. Goals against Cyprus, the Netherlands and France for Stapleton in the qualifying matches were not enough as Ireland were denied a place at the World Cup by a superior French goal difference. Stapleton was made captain of the national team for the qualifying campaign for the 1986 World Cup though Ireland failed to emulate their fine performance in the 1982 qualifiers.\n\nJack Charlton took over as the Irish manager in 1986 and he kept Stapleton as captain despite a sometimes uneasy relationship between the two men. Stapleton scored a magnificent diving header in the opening Euro 1988 qualifier against Belgium in the 2–2 draw at the Heysel Stadium, Brussels that September. He also scored in the 2–1 defeat by Bulgaria in Sofia on 1 April 1987 with another goal against Luxembourg in the 2–1 victory at Lansdowne Road the following September.\n\nStapleton captained the Irish team to the 1988 Euro finals and played in all of their matches during the competition including Ireland's famous victory against England.\n\nAfter the 1988 European Championships Stapleton remained on the fringe of the national team during qualification for World Cup Italia 1990 making just two appearances late in the campaign. By then, his 20 goals for the Republic had made him the national side's all-time leading goalscorer – a record which would be broken 10 years later by Niall Quinn, who was in the early stages of his own international career when Stapleton bowed out of the international scene.\n\nHe did, however, score an 87th-minute goal against Malta in a 3–0 friendly in Valletta just prior to those finals in Italy.\n\nStapleton moved to the United States to manage Major League Soccer side New England Revolution in 1996. In the 2003–04 season he briefly returned to English football as a specialist coach of Bolton Wanderers. The Bolton manager Sam Allardyce wanted Stapleton to enhance the skills of the strikers at the club and saw the Irishman as an ideal candidate, given his successful playing career.\n\nStapleton was appointed assistant manager to former teammate Ray Wilkins with Jordan on 3 September 2014.\n\nArsenal\n\nManchester United\n\n"}

Her appearance in the short softcore film \"Sex is My Business\" led to her meeting with magazine publisher David Sullivan, who promoted her widely as a model, and featured her in the softcore comedy \"Come Play With Me\", which ran for a record-breaking four years at the same cinema. However, in her later years she faced depression and pressure from frequent police raids on her sex shop. After a downward spiral of drug addiction, shoplifting and debt, she died at home of an overdose of medications and vodka. She was 33.\n\nMillington has been described as one of the \"two hottest British sex film stars of the seventies\", the other being Fiona Richmond.\n\nQuilter was born out of wedlock, and grew up without her father, John William G. Klein (1899-1973), initially in Willesden and later in Mid Holmwood near Dorking. She was bullied at school due to being born illegitimately, and suffered from low self-esteem throughout her childhood and teenage years. She left school at 15 and in 1964 she married Robert Maxted, and lived in Dorking. She had to nurse her terminally ill mother for more than ten years, and began her porn career to pay for her care. She had decided that she wanted to be a fashion model but at 4 feet 11 inches she was not tall enough. Instead she became a glamour model in the late 1960s.\n\nSoon after becoming a glamour model, she met the glamour photographer and pornographer John Jesnor Lindsay, who offered to photograph her for softcore magazines. She became one of his most popular models and began appearing in 8 mm hardcore porn loops which sold well in Europe. One of her first films was \"Miss Bohrloch\" in 1970. \"Miss Bohrloch\" won the Golden Phallus Award at the Wet Dream Festival held in November 1970 in Amsterdam. Maxted starred in around twenty short hardcore films for John Lindsay, although only five (\"Miss Bohrloch\", \"Oral Connection\", \"Betrayed\", \"Oh Nurse\" and \"Special Assignment\") have so far resurfaced. She then returned to modelling for British pornographic magazines such as \"Knave\" and \"Men Only\". She also appeared in softcore short films by Russell Gay (\"Response\", 1974), Mountain Films (\"Love Games\", \"Wild Lovers\") and Harrison Marks (\"Sex is My Business\", c. 1974).\n\n\"Sex is My Business\" was shot late on a Saturday night at a sex shop on London's Coventry Street. The storyline concerns a powerful aphrodisiac being dropped by a customer, the potency of which renders the shop's staff and customers sex crazy. Maxted, dressed in a short see-through dress, is the film's main focus of attention, playing a member of staff who drags a customer into the back room for some multi-position sex, thoughtfully turning on the shop's CCTV camera so others can watch. \"Sex is My Business\" was considered something of a lost film until a Super 8 mm film print of the film was located and privately transferred to DVD in 2008. The film subsequently made its internet debut on 26 July 2008 at the (now defunct) site ZDD Visual Explosion. In 2010 \"Sex is My Business\" was included as a special feature on the DVD re-release of \"Come Play With Me\".\n\nIn February 1974, Maureen O’Malley, her co-star in \"Sex is My Business\" introduced her to adult magazine publisher David Sullivan. Although she was still married, the pair became lovers. He rebranded her as Mary Millington. In her first appearance in Sullivan's \"Whitehouse\" magazine, he claimed that she was the bisexual nymphomaniac sister of the magazine's editor Doreen Millington, and so gave Mary her new stage name. She became well-known thanks to her appearances in Sullivan's porn magazines such as \"Whitehouse\" and \"Private\". She soon became the most popular model in any of Sullivan's magazines. In November 1977 magistrates acquitted her and Sullivan following prosecution under the Obscene Publications Acts.\n\nShe had a small part in Sullivan's 1977 softcore sex comedy \"Come Play with Me\", alongside Alfie Bass and Irene Handl. Although critically panned, the film was highly successful, running continuously for four years at one London cinema. It then became one of the first British films to sell in large numbers on the new VHS format. This was followed by a larger role in \"The Playbirds\" (1978), in which she was cast as a policewoman working undercover as a nude model. Although her lack of acting training was evident, \"The Playbirds\" was a commercial success. Like \"Come Play with Me\" it was extensively trailed in Sullivan's magazines. She made many public appearances at this time, promoting her films in regional cinemas, opening shops and restaurants, and raising money for the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. At the height of her fame she was also working behind the counter in Sullivan's sex shops, mainly in the \"Whitehouse\" shop in Norbury. She continued working as a call girl, which she had done since her early modelling days. She then made a cameo appearance in \"Confessions from the David Galaxy Affair\" (1979), which was a flop, and \"Queen of the Blues\" (1979). She appeared in other sex movies such as \"Eskimo Nell\" (1975), \"Intimate Games\" (1976) and Derek Ford's \"What's Up Superdoc!\" (1978). \n\nMillington's final appearance was in the Sex Pistols film \"Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\", directed by Julien Temple, which was released theatrically in March 1980. However, neither she nor her punk rock co-star Sid Vicious lived to see the completion of the movie. Liz Fraser, one of her co-stars in the film, remembered \"I was next to this girl called Mary Millington, and she and I had a great chat together…. and then we went into the pub for a lunch during the filming of that and someone said 'she’s a porn star' and I said 'I don’t understand what do you mean' and he said 'porn, p-o-r-n' and he said 'she’s naked and she does everything in all these films' but she was lovely and so I met my first porn star\".\n\nOne of Millington's most outrageous moments was being photographed topless outside 10 Downing Street. Millington, while posing for an innocuous picture with a policeman outside Number Ten, decided to unzip her top, exposing her breasts for the photograph, much to the surprise of those present, including fellow \"Come Play With Me\" actress Suzy Mandel, \"Whitehouse\" photographer George Richardson (who took the picture anyway) and the policeman in question (who tried to confiscate the film). According to Simon Sheridan's biography of Millington, \"For this stunt Mary was conditionally discharged and bound over to keep the peace\". Millington's film \"Come Play With Me\" still stands as one of the longest-running films in British movie history, and ran continuously at the Moulin Cinema in London's West End from 1977 to 1981. In a publicity stunt for the second anniversary of the film's opening, both Suzy Mandel and Millington posed in lingerie on the Moulin cinema's marquee.\n\nIn 1978 she was approached to appear in a hardcore porn film called \"Love is Beautiful\", to have been directed by Gerard Damiano. However, despite Millington and Damiano being pictured together at that year's Cannes Film Festival, the movie (meant to have been produced by David Grant’s Oppidan Films) never materialized. Potential co-stars may have included Harry Reems, Gloria Brittain and Lisa Taylor. That same year she turned 33, and found herself being replaced by younger models in Sullivan's magazines. In March 1978 she ceased to work in Sullivan's \"Whitehouse\" sex shop in Norbury and opened her own in Tooting called \"Mary Millington's International Sex Centre\". She began to spend more time working in her own sex shop, selling illegal material. The shop was raided by the police on numerous occasions, and she claimed the police threatened her and forced her to pay protection money. In the past she had publicly criticised police raids on sex shops and published the addresses and telephone numbers of Scotland Yard, the Director of Public Prosecutions and Members of Parliament in her magazines.\n\nMillington had always been prone to neurosis and depression, which was exacerbated by her cocaine habit. Her mother's death in 1976 also affected her deeply, and her behaviour became unpredictable, which led to her breaking up with Sullivan. Her life had begun a downward spiral into drug use and depression following the raids on her shop. A few months prior to her death, she had received a large tax bill which she was unable to pay. Her kleptomania became more pronounced in the last year of her life, with arrests for shoplifting in June 1979, and again for stealing a necklace the day before her death.\n\nMillington committed suicide at age 33, by an overdose of tricyclic antidepressant anafranil, paracetamol and alcohol at her home in Walton-on-the-Hill, Surrey. Her husband found her dead in her bed on 19 August 1979. She left four suicide notes which were found near her body. In one of them she had written, \"The police have framed me yet again. They frighten me so much. I can't face the thought of prison... The Nazi tax man has finished me as well.\" In another note, to her solicitor Michael Kaye (partly published in \"Private\" magazine no 59), Millington wrote \"the police have killed me with their threats…the police have made my life a misery with frame ups. The tax man has hounded me so much- I will be made bankrupt, he mustn't get anything of his £200,000 demands. He is a religious maniac.\" In another note, to David Sullivan, she wrote: \"please print in your magazines how much I want porn to be legalised, but the police have beaten me\".\n\nMillington was a member of the National Campaign for the Reform of the Obscene Publications Acts (NCROPA) and encouraged her readers to demand the abolition of the Acts. After her death, NCROPA founder David Webb wrote \"Mary was a dear, kind person and we much admired her courage in standing up to the bigotry and repression which still so pervades the establishment of this country. She obviously had tremendous pressures put on her as a result and there is no doubt in my mind that these must have contributed to this tragedy.\"\n\nShe was buried at St Mary Magdalene Church, in South Holmwood, Surrey marked by a grey granite tombstone which bears her married name. She is buried in the same grave as her mother, Joan Quilter, who died in 1976.\n\nMillington has been described as one of the \"two hottest British sex film stars of the seventies\", the other being Fiona Richmond. David Sullivan described her as \"the only really uninhibited, natural sex symbol that Britain ever produced and who believed in what she did\". Between 1975 and 1982 there was always at least one of Millington's films playing in London's West End.\n\nA posthumous exploitation film about her life was released in London in October 1980, entitled \"Mary Millington's True Blue Confessions\". In 1996, Channel Four screened a tribute to her entitled \"Sex and Fame: The Mary Millington Story\", featuring an interview with David Sullivan.\n\nTwenty years after her death, the author and film historian Simon Sheridan put Millington's life into context in the biography \"Come Play with Me: The Life and Films of Mary Millington\". Further information about her career can be found in Sheridan's follow-up book \"Keeping the British End Up: Four Decades of Saucy Cinema\", the fourth edition of which was published in April 2011.\n\nIn 2004 Millington's prominence was recognized by her inclusion in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", edited by Colin Matthew and Brian Harrison. Her entry was written by Richard Davenport-Hines.\n\nIn 2008 an exhibition of the work of the late glamour photographer Fred Grierson was held in London, which included several little-seen pictures of Millington taken by Grierson at June Palmer's Strobe Studios in the early 1970s.\n\nIn 2009, Millington was referenced in an episode of \"EastEnders\" (broadcast Thursday 18/06/09) when Aunt Sal (Anna Karen), after hearing Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Janus) had been caught in a compromising position on the Queen Vic's floor, greeted Ronnie with \"ooh, here she is, Mary Millington herself\".\n\nIn late 2009, an 8 mm copy of one of her early John Lindsay short films \"Special Assignment\" resurfaced. Unseen since the early 1970s, it was subsequently transferred to DVD. Two years later in 2011, \"Wild Lovers\", another 8 mm film starring Millington, was also traced and transferred from 8 mm to DVD.\n\nA nightclub in Liverpool is named after her. She is commemorated in a blue plaque on the site of the former Moulin Cinema in Great Windmill Street, Soho for her appearance in \"Come Play with Me\". The film ran there continuously for 201 weeks, from April 1977 to March 1981, and is listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the longest-running British film. However, the validity of this record and the blue plaque has been called into question by film historian Allen Eyles who says that \"Come Play with Me\" ran for 165 weeks and that Britain's longest running film was \"South Pacific\" which ran for four years and twenty-two weeks.\n\nA feature-length documentary chronicling Millington's life, entitled \"Respectable – The Mary Millington Story\", was partly-shot and produced at Pinewood Studios in 2015.\n\nWritten, directed and produced by Mary Millington's biographer, Simon Sheridan, the film mixes archive footage, previously unseen photographs and interviews with Millington's family, friends and co-stars, including David Sullivan, Pat Astley, Dudley Sutton, Linzi Drew and Flanagan.\n\nThe film received its world premiere at London's Regent Street Cinema on 7 April 2016. A DVD of the film was released in the UK on 2 May 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his role as the cowboy Trampas during the entire run from 1962 to 1971 of the NBC Western series, \"The Virginian\", loosely based on the Owen Wister novel.\n\nMcClure was born in Glendale, California. His English mother, Clara Elsie (née Barker; 1907–1997), had moved to the United States from her native United Kingdom in 1915, when her widowed mother married an American, Frank S Artman. Clara Barker was naturalized as an American citizen in 1918, and married Irish-American Donald Reed McClure (1904–1965) in 1929. Donald and Clara were parents to Donald Reed McClure Jr. (1931–2003) and then Doug. The widowed Clara married former Beverly Hills mayor Frank Clapp in 1971.\n\nMcClure's acting career included such films as \"The Enemy Below\", \"The Unforgiven\" and \"Because They're Young\", before he landed the role of Trampas on \"The Virginian\" – a role that would make him famous. He also starred:\n\n\nMcClure had a minor role in 1957 as an Army officer in \"California Gold Rush in Reverse\" on the syndicated anthology series \"Death Valley Days\". The episode is a dramatization of the race in 1848 between the Army and the Navy to be the first to deliver gold nuggets from California to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1958 and 1959, McClure appeared in three episodes of the syndicated Western series \"26 Men\", stories of the Arizona Rangers.\nMcClure was in the third episode \"Mr. Denton on Doomsday\", of CBS's \"The Twilight Zone\".\n\nThen, in 1962, he was cast as Trampas on NBC's \"The Virginian\". His co-stars throughout the series were James Drury, Roberta Shore, Lee J. Cobb, Randy Boone, Gary Clarke, Clu Gulager, Diane Roter, Charles Bickford, Sara Lane, Tim Matheson, Jeanette Nolan and John McIntire.\n\nIn 1965, he appeared in \"Shenandoah\", an Andrew V. McLaglen film starring James Stewart, Glenn Corbett, Patrick Wayne, Katharine Ross and Rosemary Forsyth.\n\nAfter \"The Virginian\" ended in 1971, McClure was slated to co-star with Bette Davis on a series about a parolee assisting a judge, played by Davis, by doing detective work. The pilot, produced and written by the prolific team of Richard Levinson and William Link, failed to generate interest in the series and was released as a telemovie under the title \"The Judge and Jake Wyler\". McClure made another attempt at a television series during the 1972–73 season by co-starring on \"SEARCH\" as a hi-tech investigator, rotating with Anthony Franciosa and Hugh O'Brian, and again in 1975–76 in \"The Barbary Coast\", co-starring William Shatner (with whom he'd previously starred in \"The Virginian\" episode 'The Claim'). He then shifted to low-budget science fiction films such as \"At the Earth's Core\", \"The Land That Time Forgot\" and \"The People That Time Forgot\", all three based on the novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs. In 1967, he played the Errol Flynn role in a remake of \"Against All Flags\" titled \"The King's Pirate\". He was cast in the lead in three World War II adventures, \"The Longest Hundred Miles\", \"The Birdmen\", and \"State Of Division\" (also known as \"Death Race\"). In the 1970s and 1980s, McClure appeared in commercials for Hamms Beer. McClure also appeared as the blonde slave to Jamie Farr's character in the sequel \"Cannonball Run II\" (1984).\n\nHe also had a cameo role as a poker player in the 1994 remake of \"Maverick\".\n\nIn 1994, McClure was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television at 7065 Hollywood Blvd. It was unveiled in what would be his final public appearance.\n\nOn February 5, 1995, McClure died at age 59 from lung cancer in Sherman Oaks, California. He is interred at Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, in Santa Monica. McClure was married to his fifth wife at the time of his death. McClure was divorced four times, including twice while he was performing on \"The Virginian\". He was also survived by his two children, actress Tané (from his first marriage) and Valerie (from his fourth marriage).\n\nThe character of Troy McClure on \"The Simpsons\" was modeled after McClure and fellow actor Troy Donahue. Mike Reiss, executive producer of \"The Simpsons\", said that Doug McClure's daughter informed him that Doug was a big fan of \"The Simpsons\". She said that while watching an episode Doug saw the character Troy McClure on the show and said, \"Are they making fun of me?\" Doug said he thought the parody was funny and his daughters would call him Troy McClure behind his back as a joke.\n\nIn the episode of \"Red Dwarf\" titled \"Backwards\", Rimmer and Kryten landed on Earth. When Rimmer asked Holly what the time period was, his question was, \"Do we expect to see a herd of flesh-eating dinosaurs feeding off the bones of Doug McClure?\" McClure is also referenced in the \"Red Dwarf\" episode \"Legion\" in an apology from Kryten to Lister about the evening movie – \"I'm sorry sir, it is another Doug McClure. Please, don't hit me.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1796590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796590", "title": "Bid whist", "text": "Bid whist\n\nBid whist is a partnership trick-taking variant of the classic card game whist. As indicated by the name, bid whist adds a bidding element to the game that is not present in classic whist. It is generally accepted that the game of bridge came from the game of whist. Bid whist, along with spades, remains popular particularly in U.S. military culture and a tradition in African-American culture with probable roots in the period of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe general play of bid whist is similar to that of whist, with four notable exceptions. In whist, the trump suit for a given hand is determined at random by the last card dealt, whereas in bid whist, the trump suit (or whether there will even be a trump suit) for a given hand is determined by the outcome of the bidding process.\n\nSecondly, whether a trick is won by the higher-ranking card of the winning suit, or by the lower-ranking card of that suit is also determined by the outcome of the bidding process. Thirdly, whether the ace is the highest-ranking card of the suit or the lowest-ranking card can change from hand to hand, depending on whether higher-ranking cards or lower-ranking cards win in that hand. And lastly, the scoring of the game is handled differently.\n\nUptown\n\nTrumps: Big joker, little joker, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2\n\nNon-trump: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2\n\nDowntown\n\nTrumps: Big joker, little joker, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K\n\nNon-trump: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K\n\nIn most variations, a 'kitty' of four, five, or six cards is dealt separately from the cards delivered to each player. If no jokers are being used, the kitty will consist of four cards. If one joker is being used, the kitty will consist of five cards. And if two jokers are being used, the kitty will consist of six cards.\n\nIn bid whist, after all of the cards have been dealt, but prior to the beginning of game play, each player may submit a bid. If a player chooses not to bid, the player may pass. Just as with the game play, the bidding starts with the player to the dealer's left and proceeds clockwise to each player in turn, ending with the dealer.\n\nIn order to bid, a player must make a bid that is 'better' (see below) than the best bid made by a previous player for the current hand. Unlike bridge, no deals are passed. If the first three players pass, the dealer (the last player) must make a bid. Most games set a minimum bid of at least four, though \"officially\" three is the minimum bid.\n\nA player's bid consists of a declaration of the minimum number of books (over the required 6 books) that will be taken (turned) by that player and their partner, followed by an indication either that the player wishes there to be no trump suit for the current hand, or of whether the player wishes for higher-ranking or for lower-ranking cards to be victorious in the current hand.\n\nIn determining what makes a bid 'better' than a previous bid, the initial consideration is the number of books being declared. Bidding a higher number of books than the current bid is always sufficient for making a better bid. Bidding a lower number of books can never be sufficient. If a player wishes to bid the same number of books as the current, the next consideration is whether the current bid indicated there would be no trump suit. If not, and the current bid indicates that there will be a trump suit, then the player now bidding may better the current bid by claiming the same number of books but now bidding that there will be no trump suit. If the current bid already indicates there will be no trump suit, that bid may only be bettered by indicating a higher number of books.\n\nIn some variations, a bid which indicates that there will be a trump suit, and that higher-ranking cards will win, can also be bettered by bidding the same number of books and indicating that there will be a trump suit and that lower-ranking cards will win. In other variations, however, a bid for higher-ranking cards and a bid for lower-ranking cards, each with the same number of books, are considered equal bids.\nA no trump bid can be made without an over bid and can be a high(uptown)or a low(downtown) bid. A no trump bid takes out a trump bid.\n\nAt the end of the bidding process, the player who has made the best bid is deemed to have won the bid. The winning bidder's indication regarding either having no trump suit, or the ranking of cards is granted for the duration of the hand. That player and their partner are now committed to taking at least the number of books indicated in the bid. The opposing player and their partner are committed to 'setting' the bidding team by preventing the bidding team from succeeding in taking the number of books to which they are committed.\n\nIf the winning bid indicated a desire for no trump suit, then prior to the beginning of game play, the winning bidder must now indicate whether high-ranking or low-ranking cards will be victorious during that hand. Conversely, if the winning bid indicated whether high- or low-ranking cards would win during this hand, the winning bidder must now declare a trump suit for this hand. In high-winning hands, an ace serves as the highest card of its suit (better than a king). In low-ranking hands, an ace serves as the lowest card of its suit (under the 2).\n\nAfter making this final declaration, the player receives into their hand the cards from the kitty (if one was used), and the player then discards an equal number of cards from their hand. In some variations, the cards of the kitty are overturned (sported) to be visible to all players prior to the winning bidder taking those cards into their hand. In other variations, the kitty is not sported, and only the winning bidder sees what cards they are. The most commonly played variation is to sport the kitty when there is a trump suit, and not sport when there is no trump suit.\n\nIf there is a trump suit in the upcoming hand, and if jokers are being used, the jokers become the best cards of the trump suit (better than the ace) regardless of whether high-ranking cards or low-ranking cards are the winners. If there is no trump suit, the jokers are worthless.\n\nThe objective of the play is to win tricks. A trick consists of four cards, one from the hand of each player, in rotation, the first card played to a trick generally being called the lead. A player is required to follow suit to the card led, if possible. Failure to follow suit when a player has a card of the suit played is called a renege (see Renege below). If the player cannot follow suit, he may play any card.\n\nSome people play that if the hand is a no trump hand and a player has a joker in his hand, he must throw off the joker the first time a suit is played and the player does not have a card of the suit played. Other players play that if the hand is a no-trump hand, players who have a joker must turn in the joker for one of the discarded cards in the kitty. Many people do not like to play the latter way, because it gives an indication of what suit the bid-taker has discarded.\n\nFor trump bids, it is generally preferred to cut a suit with a trump card when the player cannot follow the suit controlled by the opponents. The highest bidder always plays the first lead card in the game. After this play, the player who won the trick leads off to the player seated at his left. The play continues in this way until all twelve tricks have been played.\n\nWhen a trick is completed, i.e., four cards played, a member of the side which won the trick takes the four cards, turns them face down, and places them in front of him in a row. It is customary for one player to take in all the tricks won by his side. The tricks should be kept separated from one another so that any previous trick can be referred to, if necessary. A player may turn and look back at the last trick until he or his partner has led or played to the next player. After that, he may not look at any previous tricks, unless a renege is called.\n\nBid whist is a game of skills and strategy. While you cannot audibly tell your partner what you want him to play (this is called talking across the board), there are many non-verbal cues that partners give each other during play. It is very common for a player to indicate to his partner in what suit he has a winner other than trump. This is usually done by the player playing a card from a strong suit in his hand when he is out of the trump suit.\n\nFor example, trumps are hearts and it's an uptown (high cards win) hand. A player has strong diamonds, e.g., an ace, king, queen. When that player runs out of hearts, the next time hearts are played, he will throw off a low diamond. This typically tells his partner he has some help for him in diamonds.\n\nSkilled players typically \"pull trumps\". This means they start off playing the trump suit and \"pulls\" all the trumps from the opponents. Once trumps are pulled from the opponents, the bidding player will begin playing his \"offsuit\". A player will not continue to play trumps when the opponents are out of trumps, saving his trumps to cut another suit that is played.\n\nNot pulling trumps can lead to a team being \"set\". For example: trumps are spades and the bid is uptown, high cards winning. An opposing player has one spade, a three of spades, and no diamonds. The bidding player has an ace, king and queen of diamonds. Instead of pulling trumps from his opponents, the player plays his ace of diamonds.\n\nThe opposing player with no diamonds and (for this hand) a lousy trump, will cut the ace of diamonds and take the trick. The bidding player should have first pulled trumps and then played his offsuit, the diamonds. Similarly, if the bidding player's partner takes a trick, he will give the lead back to his partner by leading back trumps, giving control back to his partner.\n\nIf the partner began playing what he thinks are winning cards, he runs the risk of one of the opposing players not having the suit played and cutting with a trump card. Also, by playing something other than his partner's trump, he opens up his partner's hand for the opposing team to see. That is, the opposing team will see what suit, other than trump, is in the bidding player's hand. The opposing team will then know what suit to keep for play when the trump suit is not played.\n\nIf a player fails to follow suit, e.g., clubs are led, player has a club, but plays a spade (or some other suit), the player has reneged. It is up to the opposing team to spot the renege and call it. If a renege is called, the player calling it must name the specific book where the renege occurred.\n\nIf the player successfully calls the renege, the team reneging loses three tricks. If the player calls a renege and cannot identify the exact trick where the renege occurred, then the team calling the renege loses three tricks.\n\nEach team begins the game with a score of zero. At the end of each hand, the bidding team either wins points by making their bid or loses points by failing to take enough books to satisfy their bid (known as being set). The game ends when a team wins by achieving a cumulative score of seven or more, or loses by reaching a cumulative score of minus seven or worse.\n\nAt the end of each hand, the books that the team that won the bid are counted. There are 13 altogether, corresponding to the 12 cards played by each player plus the kitty (if one is used), which counts as a book won by the bidder's team. Each book won above six counts toward the team's bid. In order to make their bid, the bidding team must take at least the number of books equal to six plus their bid.\n\n\n\"Note: If Team A won the bid with a 5 High they must take 11 tricks (Initial 6 plus their bid of 5) to make their bid. If they only take 10 books (the kitty and 9 other books) Team A would have failed their bid (also known as being set) and they would go back 5 points. On the other hand if Team A made 12 books (the kitty plus 11 other books) on our 5 bid, we will score a total of 6 points for that hand.\"\n\n\nSome people play that if you miss two bids (missing a bid being called a \"felony\" also called \"lies\") you lose. This usually happens at card parties when there are other pairs waiting to play. This may be to speed up the game, as people can go on for hours going up and down before achieving seven positive (winning) or negative points (losing). You can also speed up the game by \"going out the back door\" i.e. the losing bid(points) goes to the opponent. Say one team has bid successfully for a three and later the opposing team bids four and gets set, the team with three wins. \n\nWhen there are more than two pairs of players, you can choose to play 'Rise and Fly'. If one pair gets 'set', or doesn't make their bid, they must get up and let the next waiting pair sit and play. This is the most common practice when playing with more than 4 people. This is not done when keeping score. When the opponent reaches a score of seven or more, they have won. That's when the loser gets up, or 'rises'.\n\nBid whist may also be played as an individual game. For most players, the standard 54-card deck with a 6-card kitty may be used. For a 5 player game, the kitty should be reduced to 4 cards.\n\nBids may begin at any number, and indicate the number of books the player expects to take. This number is not the bid plus six, but is an exact number (a bid of 4 would require the individual to take at least 4 books). Since players do not need to communicate with a partner, there is no need to indicate uptown or downtown with their bid. Thus, the bids, from lowest to highest, are: 1, 1NT, 2, 2NT, 3, 3NT, etc. After all but one player has passed, the player with the highest bid then announces uptown or downtown plus the trump suit, if applicable, and takes the kitty. That player is then solely responsible to take at least the number of tricks bid.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hand, each player, including the winner of the bid, scores 1 point, individually, for each trick taken. If the bid winner fails to make his bid, he scores zero points, and loses the amount of his bid. The first player to score 30 points, individually, is the winner.\n\n\n"}

Between the years 1863 and 1892, ten grammar schools were opened under the auspices of the Act. The first of these was Ipswich Grammar School, which opened in 1863.\nThe Grammar Schools Act was the fourth bill of the first parliament of Queensland. Along with the \"Primary Schools Act (Qld)\" 1860, it aimed to bring Queensland under one general and comprehensive education system without prejudice.\n\nIn the early years of Australian education, denominational schools (particularly Anglican schools) had a large influence. These schools were criticised over a number of decades for proliferating a social divide, and providing poor and biased education. By the time of the first parliament of Queensland in 1860, there was a general feeling that any system of education established in Queensland should be free of denominationalism.\n\nThe Act received little opposition in either House of Parliament – revealing its popularity. It found the approval of the public in general, and even amongst sections of the Anglican community. The Act marked a departure from the education systems in place in Victoria and New South Wales, where schools were generally tied up with respective religious bodies or (in the case of schools such as Sydney Grammar School) being provided massive, ineffective endowments, with little effort required from the community.\nThe main points of the Act are summarised below. Basically, the Act allowed for the establishment of a grammar school in any town where £1000 could be raised locally. The Queensland Government then matched that figure. The Schools were to be administered by a seven-member Board of Trustees, of which four members were appointed by the Governor. The Act also made provision for public scholarships for students to attend university in Britain or the southern states of Australia.\n\nThe act was repealed in 1975 and replaced with the Grammar Schools Act 1975.\n\nThere were ten grammar schools opened under the Act – eight of which remain open today. In chronological order, they were:\n\n\nWhen it opened in 1881, Rockhampton Grammar School was co-educational. Only four years later, the Board of Trustees decided to exclude females from the School, leading to the construction of Rockhampton Girls Grammar School. The latter opened on 11 March 1892 – one day after the official opening of Ipswich Girls Grammar School. (Females were readmitted to Rockhampton Grammar School in 1977 after a 92-year absence).\n\nIn 1936, hit hard by the effects of the Great Depression, the Maryborough Grammar School and Maryborough Girls Grammar School were forced to close. They were subsequently taken over by the Department of Education, Queensland Government, and renamed the Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Boys and Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Girls. In 1974, these schools merged to become the Maryborough State High School.\n\nThe main aspects of the Act were as follows:\n\n\n"}

He coined the term POPaganda to describe a mash-up of high and low cultural touchstones, from superhero mythology to totems of art history, populated with his original characters, including MC Supersized, the obese fast-food mascot featured in the movie \"Super Size Me\", and Abraham Obama, the fusion of America’s 16th and 44th Presidents. Other characters in English’s paintings, billboards, and sculpture include three-eyed rabbits, cowgirls and grinning skulls – visual, with humorous undertones.\n\nEnglish was interviewed for the documentary \"Super Size Me\" (2004), which showed his McDonald's-themed artwork—inspired by his belief about the effect of fast food franchises and restaurant chains on American culture – \"MC Supersized\" is English's interpretation of Ronald McDonald, a western culture \"Buddha\" eating a diet of what is sold by McDonald’s in the religion of consumerism and an over-sated devotee.\n\n\"Abraham Obama,\" made during the 2008 US Presidential Election, was a \"portrait-fusion\" of America's 16th and 44th Presidents.\n\nEnglish has painted album covers for The Dandy Warhols' \"Welcome to the Monkey House\", the 2010 album \"Slash\", and the for \"F.A.M.E\". Some of his paintings were used in the Morgan Spurlock documentaries \"Super Size Me\" and \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold\". English has collaborated with Daniel Johnston and Jack Medicine in the \"Hyperjinx Tricycle\" project. In 2010 he created the artwork for Art Nouveau Magazine's first print issue.\n\nEnglish is the subject of a Pedro Carvajal documentary titled \"Popaganda\" (after one of his art books). He is also a subject of \"The Art Army\" action figures by Michael Leavitt. English and his fellow artists Shepard Fairey, Kenny Scharf and Robbie Conal guest-starred on the March 4, 2012, episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart.\" In 2015 he was a guest judge on the Oxygen Network's reality show \"Streetart Throwdown\" created by Justin BUA. English's work was included in Seth Rogen's film \"This is the End\" and \"Movie 43\".\n\nEnglish has an early background as an art reproducer. English has initiated and participated in illegal public art campaigns since the early 1980s and for this is often referred to as the 'Godfather of Street Art'. Ron English street art activities are the subject matter and covered extensively in the Pedro Carvajal documentary titled Popaganda.\n\nCulture jamming is one aspect of English's work. Although never an official member, Ron several times joined with the Billboard Liberation Front, which practices culture jamming by altering billboards by changing key words to radically alter the message, often to an anti-corporate message. Frequent targets of English's work include Joe Camel, McDonald's, and Mickey Mouse.\n\nEnglish intends his culture jamming technique to inspire people to question consumer capitalism. English does this by using his over emphasized, grotesque, and to some, offensive, characters to intrigue the consumer, luring them in to reveal the truth behind the product.\n\nLater English focused on another form of advertising: product packaging. He recreates several different kinds of packaging (cereal boxes, milk cartons, cigarette packs, etc.), to reveal truth in advertising. After designing the packaging English and his Team POPaganda infiltrate different retailers around the country and \"shop gift\". Some of English's product packaging designs include, \"Cap'n Corn Starch\", \"Duncan High Hash Brownies\" and \"Camel Kool's\" THC Enriched Tobacco Cigarettes.\n\nEnglish has created murals a locations throughout the world.\n\nEnglish is a fine art painter specializing in oils. He received his bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. After receiving his MFA from The University of Texas he moved to New York City and apprenticed with several artists, beginning to sell his own work. His style is characterized by extreme photo realism, use of secondary color and appropriation of pop imagery. Frequent themes are revisiting and reworking childhood with adult skill as well as examining the darker meanings behind garish pop surface imagery. English also uses historical imagery as a template to explore universal issues. He has frequently reworked images of \"The Last Supper\", \"Starry Night\", and Picasso's \"Guernica\".\n\nEnglish has appropriated many well known images and characters from pop culture, reworking them into his own images. These include a reworking of Charlie Brown into his \"Grin\" character and one of his famous \"MC Supersized\" based on the idea that Ronald McDonald ate his own product. Another image of the idealized American female is that of Marilyn Monroe with Mickey Mouse breasts.\n\nIn 1980, English exhibited \"Grade School Guernica\", one of his versions of Picasso's \"Guernica\", at the Station Museum of Contemporary Art in Houston. The painting depicts the scene acted out by his children viewed from the point of view of the bomber airplane. His largest collection of \"Guernica\" paintings was on view at Allouche gallery in New York City from September to October 2016.\n\n\"Lazarus Rising\" was English's first exhibit in the UK, at Elms Lesters Painting Rooms in London. His exhibition \"Season in Supurbia\" took place in 2009 at the Corey Helford Gallery in Culver City, where he had a second exhibition \"POPagandastan\" in 2013. In 2011 he exhibited \"Skin Deep: Post-Instinctual Afterthoughts on Psychological Nature\", a new body of works exploring the inner lives of iconic figures, at Lazarides in London that represents the artist.\n\nIn 2005 English began creating designer toy versions of his creatures and has been producing these collectibles ever since. He has produced over 50 different designer toys.\n\nRonnnie Rabbbit was English's first designer toy, produced in 2005 by Dark Horse. In 2013, he joined Slash to create a limited edition fiberglass bust of the image used for the \"Slash and Friends\" album artwork. He also joined singer Chris Brown to launch their \"Dum English\" toy; a 10-inch turquoise and pink Astronaut Star Skull.\n\nIn 2013, English collaborated with rock band Pearl Jam to produce \"Falla Sheep\", a blind box line-up with seven color variants of 3.5 inch sheep in wolves' clothing toys. These were sold in stores and also at shows during Pearl Jam's 2013 tour.\n\nSee Wikiquote page .\n\n\nRon English has produced the following music projects:\n\n 1.

He married Arlene Francis on May 14, 1946, and they had a son named Peter Gabel.\n\nOne of Gabel's earliest noted roles was as Neil Williams, a newspaper reporter, on the radio serial comedy \"Easy Aces\" in the mid-to-late 1930s. Gabel's most noted work was as narrator and host of the May 8, 1945, CBS Radio broadcast of Norman Corwin's epic dramatic poem \"On a Note of Triumph\", a commemoration of the fall of the Nazi regime in Germany and the end of World War II in Europe. The broadcast was so popular that the CBS, NBC, Blue and Mutual networks broadcast a second live production of the program on May 13. The Columbia Masterworks record label subsequently published an album of the May 13 production. The production became the title focus of the Academy Award-winning short film \"\" in 2005, the 60th anniversary year of the broadcast. \n\nGabel was first associated with Orson Welles when he played Javert in his six-part radio adaptation of \"Les Misérables\" (1937).

He was educated at the Roman Catholic Presentation Brothers College in Cork.\n\nCantwell played as a full-back for Western Rovers, Cork Athletic, West Ham United and Manchester United.\n\nWhile at West Ham, he featured in the London XI side that competed in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final on 1 May 1958. He captained the Hammers to winning the Division Two championship in the 1957–58 season and thereby leading the club into the top flight for the first time since 1932.\n\nIn November 1960, Cantwell joined Manchester United for £29,500 which at the time was a record for a full back. He helped the club win the 1965 and 1967 league titles and captained United when winning the 1963 FA Cup Final – just as his fellow countryman Johnny Carey had done in United's previous FA Cup win 15 years earlier.\n\nHe also served as Chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association.\n\nHe won 36 full International caps for the Republic of Ireland (typically playing at left full back and on several occasions at centre forward). He made his debut against Luxembourg in October 1953; his final appearance coming away to Turkey in February 1967. He scored 14 goals including 5 from penalties and also captained the Republic on several occasions including a match against England at Wembley.\n\nIn his first managerial role at Coventry City he had the onerous task of following Jimmy Hill who had taken the club into the First Division for the first time in their history. Cantwell narrowly kept the Sky Blues in the top in his first two seasons before taking them to a sixth-place finish in 1969–70, earning them qualification for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (a year before it was replaced by the UEFA Cup).\n\nHe departed from Highfield Road on 12 March 1972, but within seven months was back in English football as manager of Peterborough United.\n\nHe helped Peterborough win the Fourth Division title in his first full season as manager, before leaving on 10 May 1977 to manage the New England Tea Men.\n\nHe returned to Peterborough on 19 November 1986 for a second spell as manager, remaining in this role until he became general manager on 12 July 1988.

After World War I, his family moved to England, where he was educated at Shrewsbury School and Trinity College, Cambridge. A specialist in modern languages, he taught at Stowe and St. Paul's schools. After completing university, Rudé took a trip to the Soviet Union with friends. When he returned he was a \"committed Communist and anti-Fascist\", despite his family’s fairly conservative political views.\nIn 1935 Rudé joined the British Communist Party. Communism awoke in Rudé an interest in history in which he pursued during the 1930s and 1940s attending London University part-time. During this time he taught at the preparatory schools of Stowe and St Paul’s. When the war broke out he joined the London Fire Service where he extinguished fires caused by German bombs.\n\nHe received his doctorate at the University of London in 1950 for a thesis on crowd action during the French Revolution. He taught modern languages in English secondary schools while publishing. His first book, \"The Crowd in the French Revolution\", soon became a classic.\n\nRudé was actively involved with the Communist party, an affiliation which caused him many hardships during his life. In 1949, he was relieved of his duties at St Paul’s for the activities of the political party which he was affiliated with. He accepted teaching positions at Sir Walter St John's Grammar School for Boys and later at Holloway Comprehensive School. Rudé, making his new academic focus history, and with very little to back his research in Paris of revolutionary France, became a leading British historian of the French Revolution. Rudé contributed to the \"history from below\" view of history, which is history from the view of the oppressed. He focused especially on those who participated in the riots and rebellions.\n\nHe is credited by Eric Hobsbawm as having been the only member of the Historians' Group of the English Communist Party to write 18th-century history, exploring the chronological \"no-man's land between the Group's two most flourishing sections\". After writing an article about rioters during the French Revolution, he was awarded the esteemed Alexander Prize by the Royal Historical Society in 1956. Rudé wrote and was featured in a number of journals and created a scholarly name for himself under the wing of his mentor, Georges Lefebvre.\n\nHobsbawm alleged that Rudé's thesis advisor, (Alfred Cobban, a political conservative), blocked any chances Rudé may have had at getting an appointment at a University, but Friguglietti says there is no evidence of that. Feeling shunned in Britain, Rudé began looking to opportunities abroad.\n\nIn 1959, he was appointed senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide, in the home town of his wife Doreen. He took the opportunity of his time in Australia to research 19th-century British and Irish political prisoners transported to Australia as convicts. This later resulted in a major work, \"Protest and Punishment: The Story of Social and Political Protesters Transported to Australia, 1788–1868\".\n\nRudé, like most prominent communists in Australia, was put under surveillance by the government's domestic security agency, ASIO. However, they found little of interest to record. One agent noted: \"history books of which he is the author and reports of his class work at schools in England all show that he is objective in his approach to his teaching subject and has not let his own personal politics intrude in any way\".\n\nRudé accepted an offer of a foundation chair of history, at the new University of Stirling, in Scotland, during 1967. However, he fell out with the university administration and returned to Adelaide in 1969, this time as professor of history at Flinders University. In 1970, Rudé moved to Montreal, where he taught at George Williams University (later Concordia University) until he retired in 1987. He founded the Inter-University Center for European Studies. Rudé was also a visiting professor at the University of Tokyo, Columbia University in New York and the college of William and Mary in Virginia. \nWhile he was at Concordia, he also taught in the Graduate Programme of Social and Political Thought at York University, Toronto.\n\nRudé suffered deteriorating health after the early 1970s and had a brain tumour removed in 1983. After retiring, he returned to England, eventually dying in hospital at Battle on 8 January 1993. His widow Doreen placed his ashes in the garden behind their home in Rye. A tall, handsome and athletic man, he always retained the manners of an English gentleman as well as his left-wing sympathies.\n\nGeorge Rudé’s historical work focused primarily on the French Revolution and crowd behaviour in France and Great Britain, during the 18th and 19th centuries. Rudé utilizes the method of reporting and analyzing history from the \"bottom up,\" focusing on the people, not the leaders and elites. Rudé’s most notable works include \"The Crowd in the French Revolution\", \"The Crowd in History\", \"Revolutionary Europe: 1783–1815\", \"Ideology and Popular Protest\", \"Paris and London in the Eighteenth Century\", \"Debate on Europe: 1815–1850\" and \"Captain Swing: A Social History of the great English Agricultural Uprising of 1830\" (co-authored with Eric Hobsbawm).\n\nOne of Rudé’s most influential works is \"The Crowd in History\", focusing on 18th- and 19th-century dissidents and revolutionaries in France and Great Britain. Rudé analyzes the impact and importance of various uprisings between 1730 and 1848. He identifies grain shortages in France and industrialisation in Britain as the two recurring catalysts for disturbance. In this work Rudé employs a clear and precise prose style, beginning with specific examples of disturbances in Part 1, and moving on in Part 2 to \"a critical analysis of the crowd in its various manifestations\". In his introduction Rudé expresses a hope that other historians will be inspired by his new bottom-up approach to write crowd-centric histories of other eras. He made no secret of his sympathy for the underdog, and this history offers a robust defence of popular uprisings in this period.\n\nIn \"The Crowd in the French Revolution\", Rudé examines the historically neglected crowd of the French Revolution. He explains that the Revolution was not only political but more importantly a social upheaval in which the common Frenchmen played a tremendous role in the course and outcome of the Revolution. Most significantly, Rudé analyzes the French crowds in great depth to understand their composition and force on history.\n\nRudé wrote a broad survey \"Revolutionary Europe: 1783-1815\" in traditional fashion. In is he portrays France and Europe before, during and after the French Revolution. He examines the significance of the Revolution in context to the rest of the European world. The broader focus of this work was a shift from his crowd studies, which would resume in his later works.\n\nRudé’s \"Paris and London in the 18th Century\" explains the popular protests and revolts of Paris and London during the 18th century. Rudé compares and contrasts the time, place, social, political and economic factors of Paris and London. He examines the pre-industrial stages and the turbulent events that occurred in both European capitals. While this work is not predominately a history from the \"bottom up,\" Rudé does incorporate the impact of each class in Paris and London during the 18th-century events.\n\nIn \"Ideology and Popular Protest\", Rudé defines the theory behind the ideology of protest beginning with its origins in Marx and Engels. He explains his theory of ideology through various situations in pre-industrial Europe. Rudé also utilizes his explained ideology in the event of the English protests of the 18th and early 19th century and the development of the English industrial society, and closing with the possible implications of industry on society.\n\nRudé, in \"Debate on Europe: 1815-1850\", attempts to utilize the views and interpretations of other historians to argue the significant period of the first half of the 19th century. He examines the rise of national powers, the impacts of the Industrial Revolution, differences of political opinions and the various revolutions throughout Europe during this period. In addition, Rudé inserts his own argument based on the impressive and extraordinary change in Europe during this era as well as inferring at what point this change began.\n\n\"Captain Swing: A Social History of the great English Agricultural Uprising of 1830\" is a prime example of George Rudé’s focus on history \"from below\" and the examination of common people. In \"Captain Swing\", Rudé examines the people of the 1830 agricultural uprising and the impacts of these events. The entire focus of this work is on the crowd and their history, revealing a historical interpretation of history from the \"bottom up.\"\n\nGeorge Rudé’s influence was his emphasis and development of \"history from below\". Following the new Annales School of thought, Rudé strove to cast off the idea that history was only about nation-states and the men who ruled them. Accompanying Rudé in this shift was the ‘new left’, which according to Mark Gilderhus these liberal historians, \"showed the feasibility of doing history while incorporating attitudes and viewpoints other than those associated with white male elites\". Though Rudé was not part of this movement directly, he was firmly inside their ideas and helped to promote them. He believed, along with the ‘new left’ that it was the neglected people who could be used to reshape the face of history. The historian James Friguglietti comments that Rudé’s work, \"displayed sympathy for the lower classes, whether laborers or convicted criminals\". By focusing on lower classes Rudé hoped to create a new understanding of histories major events.\n\nRudé’s communist ties shaped his way of perceiving history and opened him up to the idea of looking at the history of protesters. Revolutions were transforming events, and Rudé sought to bring light to why someone would join in such an endeavor. Marxist theory believes that everyone’s primary motives for acting are always linked with their material need. Using this frame of reference Rudé places it on the people of the French Revolution and created specific faces in the crowds. He sought to dismantle the myth that the crowd in the revolution is seen as a great evil mass of people bent on destruction of order. As Rudé paints it, \"those who took to the streets were ordinary, sober citizens, not half-crazed animals, not criminals\". By taking such a view the history of the French revolution was transformed. Common people were suddenly being taken as important historical actors in their own context.\n\nIn the decades that Rudé was writing, his new way of looking at history fit well into the social scene. It was the age of liberation, as the oppressive systems that segregated classes, genders, and races were being torn down. People were in need of a new history that included all aspects of society. Writing \"history from below\", brought in those forgotten yet not unimportant members of history into the narrative. Rudé did this by showing the common people in the revolutions and protests as key players who actively sought to change history. By focusing on such groups, historians have, \"inspired new debates over the roles of class, gender, and race in accounting for human divisions and inequalities.\" In helping bring a voice to prisoners and protesters, George Rudé contributed significantly to the study of history.\n\nRudé is not without his detractors. From the start, his Marxist view of history made teaching in Great Britain very difficult at the height of Cold War fervour and brought him severe criticism. The main criticism that continues on after his death was that after developing his initial thesis of the crowd in history, he continued using that model in every case to prove his point. Some of Rudé’s work became less highly regarded after the collapse of the USSR, but, overall, his contributions to social history and the understanding of protests greatly enhanced how historians look at the past and its actors.\n\n\n\nConcordia University Records Management and Archives: George Rudé fonds\n"}

It occurs in Southern Africa in Zimbabwe and southern and eastern South Africa. This species is found in coastal and mountain grassland, often near water.\n\nIn 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Cape longclaw in his \"Ornithologie\" based on a specimen collected from the Cape of Good Hope. He used the French name \"L'alouette du Cap de Bonne Espérance\" and the Latin \"Alauda Capitis Bonae Spei\". Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his \"Systema Naturae\" for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Cape longclaw. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name \"Alauda capensis\" and cited Brisson's work. The specific name \"capensis\" denotes the Cape of Good Hope. The species is now placed in the genus \"Macronyx\" that was introduced by the English naturalist William John Swainson in 1827 with the Cape longclaw as the type species. There are two subspecies.\n\nThe Cape longclaw is a 19–20 cm long. The adult male has a grey head with a buff supercilium and a streaked blackish back. It has a bright orange gorget, black breast band and otherwise yellow underparts. The female is duller, having a yellow throat and much weaker breast band. The juvenile has a dirty yellow throat, indistinct breast band, and yellowish white underparts.\n\nThe Cape longclaw is usually found in pairs throughout the year. It feeds on the ground on insects and some seeds. The song is a musical \"cheewit cheewit\", the contact call is \"tsweet\", and there is also a mewling alarm call. Typically not found in larger groups than two, a breeding pair or more often singly. Another behavioural characteristic is the tendency of birds to stand on top of stones, anthills or large grass clumps. While doing so birds stand upright with their breast extended.\n\nThis species has a striking resemblance to the unrelated icterid meadowlarks, grassland birds of the Americas. This is presumably due to convergent evolution.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1796645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796645", "title": "Firefly (dinghy)", "text": "Firefly (dinghy)\n\nThe Firefly is a two-sail, one design, wooden or GRP sailing dinghy with no spinnaker, designed by Uffa Fox in 1938. The first four boats from the production line were named \"Fe\", \"Fi\", \"Fo\" and \"Fum\". Number one, \"Fe\", is now owned by the National Maritime Museum Cornwall. Although designed as a double-hander, it was selected as the single handed class for the 1948 Olympics but was subsequently replaced by the Finn class. The class then became popular as a low cost, one design, double hander, as was originally intended, tolerating remarkably well combined weights of 16 to 25 stone (102 to 159 kg).\n\nThe Firefly class today has a thriving open events calendar in the UK. The national championships are always held at a sea venue and attracts a very high level of dinghy racing competitors in boats of all ages from all over the country and fleets of 60 entries plus. Away events are held at a number of the top end sailing clubs in the UK including Restonguet, Itchenor, West Kirby, Felixstowe Ferry, Southport, Budworth and Rickmansworth. It has become particularly successful as a team racing boat in the UK, thanks to its high manoeuvrability, easy handling, and low cost. Another benefit is the use of smaller mainsail which enables sailing in stronger winds. The class has become particularly popular for the British Universities Sailing Association team racing events and is used in similar BSDRA events, thus many universities and schools that team race have a fleet of Fireflys, taking advantage of the benefits above.\n\nThe Firefly ideal was to produce a one-design dinghy at a low cost; this is why the class celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2006 and continues to grow. The Firefly appeals to all ages and is raced by both men and women. A more detailed history will be found on the class association website.\n\nAll modern hulls are made from GRP/fibreglass and hulls have to be ordered in advance for a batch of them to be made. E.g. universities and other institutions getting together to procure entire fleets of boats. Being made of GRP with aluminium spars makes the dinghy very light and thus fast in the right hands, putting emphasis on crew skill. They are also designed to be very simple, thus all parts are uniform, e.g. shackles and pulleys, helping to cater for a wider range of clients.\n\nAll boats are the same with the exception of sail colour (some universities have team colour-coded sails) and certain accessories such as sheet colour and edge protectors.\n\nThere is also a significant number of cold moulded wooden ply fireflies still being lovingly maintained by owners, young and old alike. While boat production ended in the late 1990s, many of the older wooden boats are still very competitive if maintained and kitted with latest modern fittings etc. They are also often sold on at very good low prices, so ideal for younger sailors if they know what they are doing.\n\nWhen racing in a mixed fleet of classes, the Firefly uses a Portsmouth Yardstick handicap of 1168 (in the RYA scheme) or a D-PN of 99.6 (US Sailing scheme).\n\n1947, Hayling Island S.C., Ralph Gore Cup & Sir Richard Fairey Cup - 1st.

{"id": "1796650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796650", "title": "Rwandan Civil War", "text": "Rwandan Civil War\n\nThe Rwandan Civil War was a civil war in Rwanda fought between the Rwandan Armed Forces, representing the government of Rwanda, and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) from 1 October 1990 to 18 July 1994. The war arose from the long-running dispute between the Hutu and Tutsi groups within the Rwandan population. A 1959–1962 revolution had replaced the Tutsi monarchy with a Hutu-led republic, forcing more than 336,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. A group of these refugees in Uganda founded the RPF which, under the leadership of Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, became a battle-ready army by the late 1980s.\n\nThe war began on 1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded north-eastern Rwanda, advancing into the country. They suffered a major setback when Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The Rwandan Army, assisted by troops from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October. Kagame, who had been in the United States during the invasion, returned to take command. He withdrew troops to the Virunga Mountains for several months before attacking again. The RPF began a guerrilla war, which continued until mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. A series of protests forced Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic opposition parties. Despite disruption and killings by Hutu Power, a group of extremists opposed to any deal, and a fresh RPF offensive in early 1993, the negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of the Arusha Accords in August 1993.\n\nAn uneasy peace followed, during which the terms of the accords were gradually implemented. RPF troops were deployed to a compound in Kigali and the peace-keeping United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) was sent to the country. But the Hutu Power movement was steadily gaining influence and planned a \"final solution\" to exterminate the Tutsi. This plan was put into action following the assassination of President Habyarimana on 6 April 1994. Over the course of about 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in the Rwandan genocide. The RPF quickly resumed the civil war. They captured territory steadily, encircling cities and cutting off supply routes. By mid-June they had surrounded the capital, Kigali, and on 4 July they seized it. The war ended later that month when the RPF captured the last territory held by the interim government, forcing the government and \"genocidaires\" into Zaire.\n\nThe victorious RPF assumed control of the country, with Paul Kagame as de facto leader. Kagame served as vice president from 1994 and as president from 2000. The RPF began a programme of rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of the country, bringing genocide perpetrators to trial, and promoting reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi. In 1996 the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched an offensive against refugee camps in Zaire, home to exiled leaders of the former regime and millions of Hutu refugees. This action started the First Congo War, which removed long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. As of 2019, Kagame and the RPF remain the dominant political force in Rwanda.\n\nThe earliest inhabitants of what is now Rwanda were the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, Bantu groups migrated into the region and began to clear forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their land and moved to the slopes of mountains. Historians have several theories regarding the Bantu migrations. One theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, and the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly originating from the Horn of Africa. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory the Hutu and Tutsi are a later class, rather than a racial, distinction.\n\nThe population coalesced, first into clans (\"ubwoko\") and by 1700 into around eight kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda, ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became dominant from the mid-eighteenth century, expanding through conquest and assimilation. It achieved its greatest extent under the reign of Kigeli Rwabugiri in 1853–1895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. These included \"uburetwa\", a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them, and \"ubuhake\", under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service. Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi were assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884, and Germany established a presence in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the King. German policy was to rule through the Rwandan monarchy, enabling colonisation with fewer European troops. The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior. The Rwandan King welcomed the Germans, and used their military strength to reinforce his rule and expand the kingdom. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule. The Belgian administration, in conjunction with Catholic clerics, modernised the local economy. They also increased taxes and imposed forced labour on the population. Tutsi supremacy remained, reinforced by Belgium's enthusiastic support of the monarchy, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised. In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards classifying each individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. It had previously been possible for wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, but the identity cards prevented further movement between the groups.\n\nAfter 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed, demanding the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu. The Tutsi leadership responded by trying to negotiate a speedy independence on their terms but found the Belgians no longer supported them. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church, with prominent conservative figures in the early Rwandan church replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these a greater proportion were Flemish rather than Walloon Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu. In November 1959 the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief in an assault by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the Rwandan Revolution. The King and Tutsi politicians launched a counter-attack in an attempt to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians, but were thwarted by Belgian Colonel Guy Logiest, who was brought in by the colonial Governor. Logiest re-established law and order and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite. He replaced many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu and effectively forced King Kigeli V into exile.\nLogiest and Hutu leader Grégoire Kayibanda declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961 and it became independent in 1962. More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda by 1964 to escape the Hutu purges, mostly to the neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire. Many of the Tutsi exiles lived as refugees in their host countries, and sought to return to Rwanda. Some supported the new Rwandan Government, but others formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda, the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963. These groups were known in Kinyarwanda as the \"inyenzi\" (cockroaches). Historians do not know the origin of this term – it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night. The \"inyenzi\" label resurfaced in the 1990s as a highly derogatory term for the Tutsi, used by Hutu hardliners to dehumanise them. The \"inyenzi\" attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them. The last significant attack was made in desperation from Burundi in December 1963 but failed due to bad planning and lack of equipment. The government responded to this attack with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.\n\nKayibanda presided over a Hutu republic for the next decade, imposing an autocratic rule similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy. In 1973 Hutu army officer Juvénal Habyarimana toppled Kayibanda in a coup. He founded the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party in 1975, and promulgated a new constitution following a 1978 referendum, making the country a one-party state in which every citizen had to belong to the MRND. Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence. A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a loss of income for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to foreign aid receipts. The family of first lady Agathe Habyarimana, known as the \"akazu\", were the principal winners in this fight. The family had a more respected lineage than that of the President, having ruled one of the independent states near Gisenyi in the nineteenth century. Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west. The \"akazu\" exploited this to their advantage, and Habyarimana was increasingly unable to rule without them. The economic situation forced Habyarimana to greatly reduce the national budget, which led to civil unrest. On the advice of French president François Mitterrand, Habyarimana declared a commitment to multi-party politics but took no action to bring this about. Student protests followed and by late 1990 the country was in crisis.\n\nThe organisation which became the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) was founded in 1979 in Uganda. It was initially known as the Rwandan Refugees Welfare Association and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU). It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan President Milton Obote. Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, Idi Amin, including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame had joined Yoweri Museveni's rebel Front for National Salvation (FRONASA). Museveni fought alongside Obote to defeat Amin in 1979 but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the 1980 general election. With Rwigyema and Kagame he formed a new rebel army, the National Resistance Army (NRA). The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in what became known as the Ugandan Bush War. President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to Nairobi in Kenya. In 1982, with the authority of Obote, local district councils in the Ankole region issued notices requiring refugees to be evicted from their homes and settled in camps. These evictions were violently implemented by Ankole youth militia. Many displaced Rwandans attempted to cross the border to Rwanda, but the Habyarimana regime confined them to isolated camps and closed the border to prevent further migration. Faced with the threat of statelessness, many more Tutsi refugees in Uganda chose to join Museveni's NRA.\n\nIn 1986 the NRA captured Kampala with a force of 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, with the goal of allowing the refugees to return home. As well as fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible. In 1988 a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing Peter Bayingana as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, Kagame assuming the vice presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice president but resented the loss of the leadership. Bayingana and his supporters attempted to start the war with an invasion in late 1989 without the support of Rwigyema, but this was quickly repelled by the Rwandan Army.\n\nRwandan President Habyarimana was aware of the increasing number of Tutsi exiles in the Ugandan Army and made representations to President Museveni on the matter. At the same time many native Ugandans and Baganda officers in the NRA began criticising Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions. He therefore demoted Kagame and Rwigyema in 1989. They remained de facto senior officers but the change in official status, and the possibility that they might lose access to the resources of the Ugandan military, caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda. In 1990 a dispute in south-western Uganda between Ugandan ranch owners and squatters on their land, many of whom were Rwandans, led to a wider debate on indigeneity and eventually to the explicit labeling of all Rwandan refugees as non-citizens. Realising the precariousness of their own positions, the opportunity afforded by both the renewed drive of refugees to leave Uganda, and the instability on the Rwandan domestic scene, Rwigyema and Kagame decided in mid-1990 to effect their invasion plans immediately. It is likely that President Museveni knew of the planned invasion but did not explicitly support it. In mid-1990 Museveni ordered Rwigyema to attend an officer training course at the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth in the United States, and was also planning overseas deployments for other senior Rwandans in the army. This may have been a tactic to reduce the threat of an RPF invasion of Rwanda. After two days of discussion Rwigyema persuaded Museveni that following years of army duty he needed a break and was allowed to remain in Uganda. Museveni then ordered Kagame to attend instead. The RPF leadership allowed him to go, to avoid suspicion, even though it meant his missing the beginning of the war.\n\nOn 1 October 1990 fifty RPF rebels deserted their Ugandan Army posts and crossed the border from Uganda into Rwanda, killing a Rwandan customs guard at the Kagitumba border post and forcing others to flee. They were followed by hundreds more rebels, dressed in the uniforms of the Ugandan national army and carrying stolen Ugandan weaponry, including machine guns, autocannons, mortars, and Soviet BM-21 multiple rocket launchers. According to RPF estimates, around 2,500 of the Ugandan Army's 4,000 Rwandan soldiers took part in the invasion, accompanied by 800 civilians, including medical staff and messengers. Both President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Habyarimana of Rwanda were in New York City attending the United Nations World Summit for Children. In the first few days of fighting, the RPF advanced south to Gabiro. Their Rwandan Armed Forces opponents, fighting for Habyarimana's government, were numerically superior, with 5,200 soldiers, and possessed armoured cars and helicopters supplied by France, but the RPF benefited from the element of surprise. The Ugandan government set up roadblocks across the west of Uganda, to prevent further desertions and to block the rebels from returning to Uganda.\n\nOn 2 October the RPF leader Fred Rwigyema was shot in the head and killed. The exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death are disputed; the official line of Kagame's government, and the version mentioned by historian Gérard Prunier in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. In his 2009 book \"Africa's World War\", Prunier states that Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander Chris Bunyenyezi wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible. The argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead. Another senior RPF officer, Stephen Nduguta, witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother Salim Saleh to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana's and Bunyenyezi's arrests and eventual executions.\n\nWhen news of the RPF offensive broke, Habyarimana requested assistance from France in fighting the invasion. The French president's son, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, was head of the government's Africa Cell and promised to send troops. On the night of 4 October, gunfire was heard in Kigali in a mysterious attack, which was attributed to RPF commandos. The attack was most likely staged by the Rwandan authorities, seeking to convince the French that the regime was in imminent danger. As a result, 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, twice as many as initially pledged. The French operation was code-named Noroît and its official purpose was to protect French nationals. In reality the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and Kigali International Airport. Belgium and Zaire also sent troops to Kigali in early October. The Belgian troops were deployed primarily to defend the country's citizens living in Rwanda but after a few days it became clear that they were not in danger. Instead, the deployment created a political controversy as news reached Brussels of arbitrary arrests and massacres by the Habyarimana regime and its failure to deal with the underlying causes of the war. Faced with a growing domestic dispute over the issue, and no with no obvious prospect of achieving peace, the Belgian government withdrew its troops by the beginning of November. Belgium provided no further military support to the Habyarimana government. Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko's contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP). Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF, but their discipline was poor. The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes, prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival. With French assistance, and benefiting from the loss of RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the Rwandan Army enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF and pushed the rebels all the way back to the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda and others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. Habyarimana accused the Ugandan Government of supplying the RPF, establishing a \"rear command\" for the group in Kampala, and \"flagging off\" the invasion. The Rwandan Government announced on 30 October that the war was over.\n\nThe Rwandan Government used the attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for the arbitrary arrest of more than 8,000 mostly Tutsi political opponents. Tutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion; Radio Rwanda aired incitement to ethnic hatred and a pogrom was organised on 11 October in a commune in Gisenyi Province, killing 383 Tutsi. It was the first time in nearly twenty years that massacres against Tutsi were perpetrated, as anti-Tutsi violence under the Habyarimana regime had been low level only up to that point.\n\nPaul Kagame was still in the United States at the time of the outbreak of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth. He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion. At the end of September Kagame informed the college that he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began. The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war. When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops. He flew through London and Addis Ababa to Entebbe Airport, where he was given safe passage by a friend in the Ugandan secret service; the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass. Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.\n\nThe RPF were in disarray by the time Kagame arrived, with troop morale very low. He later described his arrival as one of the worst experiences of his life; the troops lacked organisation following Rwigyema's death and were demoralised after their losses in the war. Kagame was well known to the RPF troops, many of whom had fought with him in the Ugandan Army, and they welcomed his arrival in the field. He spent the following weeks gathering intelligence with senior officers. By the end of October, with the RPF forced back to the Ugandan border, Kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting. He therefore withdrew most of the army from north-eastern Rwanda, moving them to the Virunga mountains. Kagame knew that the rugged terrain of the Virungas offered protection from attacks, even if the RPF's position was discovered. The march west took almost a week during which the soldiers crossed the border into Uganda several times, with the permission of President Museveni, taking advantage of personal friendships between the RPF soldiers and their ex-colleagues in the Ugandan Army.\n\nMeanwhile, some RPF soldiers remained as a decoy to carry out small-scale attacks on the Rwandan Army, who remained unaware of the Front's relocation. The reorientation towards guerrilla warfare began with a raid on a Rwandan customs post across the border from Katuna. Following the attack, the Rwandan Government accused Uganda of deliberately sheltering the RPF. The RPF's new tactics inflicted heavy casualties on the Rwandan Army, which reacted by shelling Ugandan territory. Ugandan civilians were killed and a significant amount of damage to property was incurred, and there were reports of Rwandan troops crossing the border to loot and abduct locals.\n\nConditions in the Virungas were very harsh for the RPF. At an altitude of almost , there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the high-altitude cold climate. Kagame spent the next two months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations. Alexis Kanyarengwe, a Hutu colonel who had worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation. Another Hutu, Seth Sendashonga, became the RPF's liaison with Rwandan opposition parties. Most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi. Personnel numbers grew steadily, volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries. Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldier conduct. Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population. The RPF punished personnel who broke these rules, sometimes with beatings, while more serious offences such as murder, rape, and desertion, were punishable by death.\n\nThe RPF carried out a major fundraising programme, spearheaded by Financial Commissioner Aloisia Inyumba in Kampala. They received donations from Tutsi exiles around the world, as well as from businessmen within Rwanda who had fallen out with the government. The sums involved were not enormous but, with tight financial discipline and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives, the RPF was able to grow its operational capability. It obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources, including the open market, taking advantage of a surplus of weaponry at the end of the Cold War. It is likely they also received weaponry from officers in the Ugandan Army; according to Gérard Prunier, Ugandans who had fought with Kagame in the Bush War remained loyal to him and secretly passed weaponry to the RPF. Museveni likely knew of this but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with the international community. Museveni later said that \"faced with [a] \"fait accompli\" situation by our Rwandan brothers\", Uganda went \"to help the RPF, materially, so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to the Tutsi people of Rwanda and would not have been good for Uganda's stability\". Journalist Justus Muhanguzi Kampe reported that the taking of military equipment by deserted Tutsi members of the Ugandan Army meant that the national arsenal \"nearly got depleted\"; he suspected that the war \"must have had a tremendous financial impact on the Ugandan government, especially Uganda's military budget\", costing the country \"trillions of shillings\".\n\nAfter three months of regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to fight again. The target for the first attack was the northern city of Ruhengeri, south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north-west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence and Kagame hoped this would destabilise the government.\n\nDuring the night of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters descended from the mountains into hidden locations around the city, assisted by RPF sympathisers living in the area. They attacked on the morning of 23 January. The Rwandan forces were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion. The Rwandan Police and army succeeded in briefly repelling the invasion in areas around their stations, killing large numbers of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the Rwandan Army forces were assisted by French troops, as the French Government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, the defending forces were defeated and the RPF held the whole city. Most of the civilian population fled.\n\nOne of the principal RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest. When he learnt of the invasion the warden, , telephoned the government in Kigali to request instructions. He spoke to Colonel Elie Sagatwa, one of the \"akazu\", who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison to avoid escape and defections during the fighting. He also wanted to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF. Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him and repeated the order, having confirmed it with the president. Eventually, the RPF stormed the buildings and the prisoners were liberated. Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including Théoneste Lizinde, a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.\n\nThe RPF forces held Ruhengeri through the afternoon of 23 January, before withdrawing into the mountains for the night. The raid undermined the Rwandan Government's claims that the RPF had been ejected from the country and had been reduced to conducting guerrilla operations from Uganda. The government sent troops to the city the following day and a state of emergency was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area. The RPF raided the city almost every night for several months, fighting with Rwandan army forces, and the country was back at war for the first time since the October invasion.\n\nFollowing the action in Ruhengeri the RPF again began to wage guerrilla war. The Rwandan Army massed troops across the north of the country, occupying key positions and shelling RPF hideouts in the Virunga mountains, but the mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all-out assault. Paul Kagame's troops attacked the Rwandan Army forces repeatedly and frequently, keen to ensure that the diplomatic and psychological effect of the RPF's resurgence was not lost. Kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across the north of the country, to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place. This low intensity war continued for many months, both sides launching successful attacks on the other, and neither able to gain the upper hand in the war. The RPF made some territorial gains including capturing the border town of Gatuna. This was significant as it blocked Rwanda's access to the port of Mombasa via the Northern Corridor, forcing all trade to go through Tanzania via the longer and costlier Central Corridor. By late 1991 the RPF controlled 5% of Rwanda, setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory near Mulindi, Byumba province. Many Hutu civilians in areas captured by the RPF fled to government-held areas, creating a large population of internally displaced persons in the country.\n\nThe renewed warfare had two effects in Rwanda. The first was a resurgence of violence against Tutsi still in the country. Hutu activists killed up to 1,000 Tutsi in attacks authorised by local officials, starting with the slaughter of 30–60 Bagogwe Tutsi pastoralists near Kinigi and then moving south and west to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi. These attacks continued until June 1991, when the government introduced measures to allow potential victims to move to safer areas such as Kigali. The \"akazu\" also began a major propaganda campaign, broadcasting and publishing material designed to persuade the Hutu population that the Tutsi were a separate and alien people, non-Christians seeking to re-establish the old Rwandan feudal monarchy with the final goal of enslaving the Hutu. This included the Hutu Ten Commandments, a set of \"rules\" published in the \"Kangura\" magazine, mandating Hutu supremacy in all aspects of Rwandan life. In response the RPF opened its own propaganda radio station, Radio Muhabura, which broadcast from Uganda into Rwanda. This was never hugely popular but gained listenership during 1992 and 1993.\n\nThe second development was that President Habyarimana announced that he was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following intense pressure from the international community, including his most loyal ally France. Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and opposition groups had formed in the months since, including the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Liberal Party (PL), but the one-party state law had remained in place. In mid-1991 Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change that saw a plethora of new parties come into existence. Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF, but these were quite ineffective and had no political influence. The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the \"akazu\".\n\nProgress remained slow in 1991 and 1992. A cabinet set up in October 1991 contained almost no opposition, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development party. Another one-party cabinet was announced in January 1992 which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, forcing Habyarimana to make real concessions. He announced his intention to negotiate with the RPF, and formed a multi-party cabinet in April. This was still dominated by Habyarimana's party, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and negotiated a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began peace negotiations in the Tanzanian city of Arusha.\n\nThe peace process was complicated by the fact that four distinct groups were involved, each with its own agenda. The Hutu hardliners, centred around the family of Agathe Habyarimana, were represented by the CDR as well as extremists within the president's own MRND party. The second group was the official opposition, which excluded the CDR. They had much more democratic and conciliatory aims but were also deeply suspicious of the RPF, whom they saw as trying to upset the \"democratic\" policy of Hutu rule established in the 1959 revolution. The third group was the RPF. Paul Kagame engaged with the peace process against the advice of some of his senior officers, in the knowledge that many of those on the other side of the table were hardliners who were not sincerely interested in negotiations. He feared that shunning the opportunity for peace would weaken the RPF politically and lose them international goodwill. Finally there was the group representing President Habyarimana himself, who sought primarily to hold on to his power in whatever form he could. This meant publicly striving for a middle ground compromise solution, but privately obstructing the process and trying to delay change to the status quo for as long as possible. Habyarimana recognised the danger posed to him by the radical Hutu faction and attempted in mid-1992 to remove them from senior army positions. This effort was only partially successful; \"akazu\" affiliates Augustin Ndindiliyimana and Théoneste Bagosora remained in influential posts, providing them with a link to power.\n\nThe delegates at the negotiations in Arusha made some progress in the latter half of 1992, despite wrangling between Habyarimana and hardline members of his party that compromised the government officials' negotiating power. In August the parties agreed a \"pluralistic transitional government\", which would include the RPF. The CDR and hardline faction of the MRND reacted violently to this. Feeling sidelined by the developing Arusha process, they began killing Tutsi civilians in the Kibuye area; 85 were killed, and 500 homes burnt. Historian Gérard Prunier names late 1992 as the time when the idea of a genocidal \"final solution\" to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first mooted. Hardliners were busy setting up parallel institutions within the official organs of state, including the army, from which they hoped to effect a move away from the more conciliatory tone adopted by Habyarimana and the moderate opposition. Their goal was to take over from Habyarimana's government as the perceived source of power in the country amongst the Hutu masses, to maintain the line that the RPF and Tutsi more generally were a threat to Hutu freedoms, and to find a way to thwart any agreement negotiated in Arusha.\n\nThe situation deteriorated in early 1993 when the teams in Arusha signed a full power-sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF and other major opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until free and fair elections could be held. The agreement reflected the balance of power at the time; Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition, and the RPF all accepted it, but the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole north-west of Rwanda and lasted for six days; many houses were burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed.\n\nPaul Kagame responded by pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six-month cease-fire. The RPF cited the CDR and MRND-hardliner violence as its reason for this, but according to foreign policy scholar Bruce D. Jones the offensive may actually have been intended primarily to increase the rebels' bargaining power at the peace talks. The next subject for the negotiations was the proportion of troops and officers to be allocated to each side in the new unified army. By demonstrating its military power in the field, through a successful offensive against the Rwandan Government forces, the RPF was able to secure an increased percentage of troops in the agreement.\n\nThe RPF began its offensive on 8 February, fighting southwards from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met by weak resistance from the Rwandan Army forces. The likely reason was a significant deterioration in morale and military experience within the government forces. The impact of the long-running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc, had left the government struggling to pay its soldiers regularly. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one-year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready, with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.\n\nThe RPF advance continued unchecked in February, its forces moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition. They took Ruhengeri on the first day of fighting, and later the city of Byumba. Local Hutu civilians fled \"en masse\" from the areas the RPF were taking, most of them ending up in refugee camps on the outskirts of Kigali. The civilian cost of the offensive is unclear; according to André Guichaoua several thousand were killed, while Prunier labelled the RPF killing as \"small-scale\". This violence alienated the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.\n\nWhen it became clear that the Rwandan Army was losing ground to the RPF, Habyarimana requested urgent assistance from France. Fearing that the RPF could soon be in a position to seize Kigali, the French immediately dispatched 150 troops to Rwanda, along with arms and ammunition, to bolster the Rwandan Army forces. A further 250 French soldiers were sent on 20 February. The arrival of French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.\n\nBy 20 February the RPF had advanced to within of the capital, Kigali, and many observers believed an assault on the city was imminent. The assault did not take place, and the RPF instead declared a cease-fire. Whether or not the RPF intended to advance on the capital is unknown. Kagame later stated that his aim at this point was to inflict as much damage as possible on Rwandan Army forces, capture their weapons, and gain ground slowly, but not to attack the capital or seek to end the war with an outright RPF victory. Kagame told journalist and author Stephen Kinzer that such a victory would have ended international goodwill towards the RPF and led to charges that the war had simply been a bid to replace the Hutu state with a Tutsi one. The increased presence of French troops and the fierce loyalty of the Hutu population to the government meant that an invasion of Kigali would not have been achieved with the same ease that the RPF had conquered the north. Fighting for the capital would have been a much more difficult and dangerous operation. Several of Kagame's senior officers urged him to go for outright victory but he overruled them. By the end of the February war over one million civilians, mostly Hutu, had left their homes in the country's largest exodus to date.\n\nThe RPF cease-fire was followed by two days of negotiations in the Ugandan capital Kampala, attended by RPF leader Paul Kagame, and involving President Museveni and representatives of European nations. The Europeans insisted that RPF forces withdraw to the zone they had held before the February offensive. Kagame responded that he would only agree to this if the Rwandan army were forbidden from re-entering the newly conquered territory. Following a threat by Kagame to resume fighting and potentially take even more territory, the two sides reached a compromise deal. This entailed the RPF withdrawing to its pre-February territory, but also mandated the setting up of a demilitarised zone between the RPF area and the rest of the country. The deal was significant because it marked a formal concession by Habyarimana's regime of the northern zone to the rebels, recognising the RPF hold on that territory. There were many within the RPF senior command who felt that Kagame had ceded too much, because the deal meant not only withdrawal to the pre-February boundaries, but also a promise not to encroach on the demilitarised zone. This therefore ended RPF ambitions of capturing more territory. Kagame used the authority he had accumulated through his successful leadership of the RPF to override these concerns, and the parties returned once more to the negotiating table in Arusha.\n\nDespite the agreement and ongoing negotiations President Habyarimana, supported by the French Government, spent the subsequent months forging a \"common front\" against the RPF. This included members of his own party and the CDR and also factions from each of the other opposition parties in the power-sharing coalition. At the same time other members of the same parties issued a statement, in conjunction with the RPF, in which they condemned French involvement in the country and called for the Arusha process to be respected in full. The hardline factions within the parties became known as Hutu Power, a movement which transcended party politics. Apart from the CDR there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement. Instead almost every party was split into \"moderate\" and \"Power\" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party. Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal. Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the \"Interahamwe\", which was attached to the ruling party, and the CDR's \"Impuzamugambi\". The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country. The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of the fact that the training they provided was being used to perpetrate the mass killings.\n\nBy June President Habyarimana had come to view Hutu Power, rather than the mainstream opposition, as the biggest threat to his leadership. This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion. According to Prunier this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process. The negotiation of troop numbers was protracted and difficult; twice the talks almost collapsed. The Rwandan Government wanted to allocate only 15% of the officer corps to the RPF, reflecting the proportion of Tutsi in the country, while the RPF was arguing for a 50/50 split. The RPF were in a superior position following their successful February campaign and were backed in their demands by Tanzania, which was chairing the talks. The government eventually agreed to their demands. As well as 50% of the officer corps, the RPF was allocated up to 40% of the non-command troops. The deal also mandated large-scale demobilisation; of the 35,000 Rwandan Army and 20,000 RPF soldiers at the time of the accords, only 19,000 would be drafted into the new national army. With all details agreed the Arusha Accords were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.\n\nAn uneasy peace was once again entered into, which would last until 7 April of the following year. The agreement called for a United Nations peacekeeping force; this was titled the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), and was in place in Rwanda by October 1993 under the command of Canadian General Roméo Dallaire. Another stipulation of the agreement was that the RPF would station diplomats in Kigali at the \"Conseil national de développement\" (CND), now known as the Chamber of Deputies, Rwanda's Parliament building. These men were protected by 600–1,000 RPF soldiers, who arrived in Kigali through UNAMIR's Operation Clean Corridor in December 1993. Meanwhile, the Hutu Power wings of the various parties were beginning plans for a genocide. The President of Burundi, Melchior Ndadaye, who had been elected in June as the country's first ever Hutu president, was assassinated by extremist Tutsi army officers in October 1993. The assassination reinforced the notion among Hutus that the Tutsi were their enemy and could not be trusted. The CDR and the Power wings of the other parties realised they could use this situation to their advantage. The idea of a \"final solution\", which had first been suggested in 1992 but had remained a fringe viewpoint, was now top of their agenda. An informant from the \"Interahamwe\" told UNAMIR officials that a group of Hutu extremists were planning on disrupting the peace process and killing Tutsis in Kigali.\n\nThe cease-fire ended abruptly on 6 April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the new President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira. The pair were returning home from a regional summit in Dar es Salaam at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying the implementation of the Arusha accords. The attackers remain unknown. Prunier, in his book written shortly after the incident, concluded that it was most likely a coup carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible. At the end of 2010 the Judges succeeding Bruguière ordered a more thorough scientific examination, which employed experts in ballistics and acoustics. This report seemed to reaffirm the initial theory that Hutu extremists assassinated Habyarimana. But the report did not lead the judges to drop the charges against the RPF suspects; this was finally done in 2018, due to lack of evidence.\n\nThe shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours. A crisis committee was formed by the military, headed by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, which refused to recognise Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana as leader, even though she was legally next in the line of political succession. UN commander General Dallaire labelled this a coup and insisted that Uwilingiyimana be placed in charge, but Bagosora refused. The Presidential Guard killed Uwilingiyimana and her husband during the night, along with ten Belgian UNAMIR soldiers charged with her protection and other prominent moderate politicians and journalists. The crisis committee appointed an interim government, still effectively controlled by Bagosora, which began ordering the systematic killing of huge numbers of Tutsi, as well as some politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks. Over the course of approximately 100 days between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed.\n\nOn 7 April, as the genocide started, RPF commander Paul Kagame warned the interim government and the United Nations peacekeepers that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day Rwandan Army forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions but RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back. The RPF then crossed the demilitarised zone from their territory in the north and began an attack on three fronts, leaving their opponents unsure of their true intentions or whether an assault on Kigali was imminent. UNAMIR contingents in the demilitarised zone withdrew to their camps to avoid being caught in the fighting. Kagame refused to talk to the interim government, believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora's rule and not committed to ending the genocide. Over the next few days the RPF moved steadily south through the eastern part of the country, capturing Gabiro and large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali. Their unit stationed in Kigali was isolated from the rest of their forces but a unit of young soldiers successfully crossed government-held territory to link up with them. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba at this stage but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF also allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF controlled areas.\n\nIn April there were numerous attempts by the United Nations forces to establish a cease-fire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April the RPF secured the whole of the Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the Rwandan Army forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far north-west. As well as fighting the war Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and Rwandan Tutsi refugees who had been living in Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.\nIn late June 1994 France launched \"Opération Turquoise\", a UN-mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for displaced persons, refugees, and civilians in danger. From bases in the Zairian cities of Goma and Bukavu, the French entered south-western Rwanda and established the \"Turquoise\" zone, within the Cyangugu–Kibuye–Gikongoro triangle, an area occupying approximately a fifth of Rwanda. Radio France International estimates that \"Turquoise\" saved around 15,000 lives, but with the genocide coming to an end and the RPF's ascendancy, many Rwandans interpreted \"Turquoise\" as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some who had participated in the genocide. The French remained hostile to the RPF and their presence held up the RPF's advance in the south-west of the country. \"Opération Turquoise\" remained in Rwanda until 21 August 1994.\n\nHaving completed the encirclement of Kigali, the RPF spent the latter half of June fighting for the capital. The Rwandan Army forces had superior manpower and weapons, but the RPF steadily gained territory and conducted raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines. According to Dallaire, this success was due to Kagame's being a \"master of psychological warfare\"; he exploited the fact that the Rwandan Army were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali and exploited the government's loss of morale as it lost territory. The RPF finally defeated the Rwandan Army in Kigali on 4 July and on 18 July took Gisenyi and the rest of the north-west, forcing the interim government into Zaire. This RPF victory ended the genocide as well as the civil war. At the end of July 1994 Kagame's forces held the whole of Rwanda except for the \"Turquoise\" zone in the south-west. The date of the fall of Kigali, 4 July, was later designated Liberation Day by the RPF and is commemorated as a public holiday in Rwanda.\n\nThe UN peacekeeping force, UNAMIR, was in Rwanda during the genocide, but its Chapter VI mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily. Efforts by General Dallaire to broker peace were unsuccessful, and most of UNAMIR's Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate. Its most significant contribution was to provide refuge for thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu at its headquarters in Amahoro Stadium, as well as other secure UN sites, and to assist with the evacuation of foreign nationals. The Belgian Government, which had been one of the largest troop contributors to UNAMIR, pulled out in mid-April following the deaths of its ten soldiers protecting Prime Minister Uwilingiliyimana. In mid-May the UN conceded that \"acts of genocide may have been committed\", and agreed to reinforcement. The new soldiers started arriving in June, and following the end of the genocide in July they stayed to maintain security and stability, until the termination of their mission in 1996. Fifteen UN soldiers were killed in Rwanda between April and July 1994, including the ten Belgians, three Ghanaians, an Uruguayan, and Senegalese Mbaye Diagne who risked his life repeatedly to save Rwandans.\n\nThe victorious RPF assumed control of Rwanda following the genocide, and as of 2013 remain the dominant political force in the country. They formed a government loosely based on the Arusha Accords, but Habyarimana's party was outlawed and the RPF took over the government positions allocated to it in the accords. The military wing of the RPF was renamed as the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) and became the national army. Paul Kagame assumed the dual roles of Vice President of Rwanda and Minister of Defence; Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu who had been a civil servant under Habyarimana before fleeing to join the RPF, was appointed president. Bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs but Kagame remained commander-in-chief of the army and de facto ruler of the country.\n\nRwandan's infrastructure and economy suffered greatly during the genocide. Many buildings were uninhabitable and the former regime had taken all currency and moveable assets when they fled the country. Human resources were severely depleted, with over of the population having fled or been killed. Many of the remainder were traumatised: most had lost relatives, witnessed killings, or participated in the genocide. The long-term effects of war rape included social isolation, sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies and babies, some women resorting to self-induced abortions. The army, led by Paul Kagame, maintained law and order while the government began the work of rebuilding the country's institutions and infrastructure.\n\nNon-governmental organisations began to move back into the country but the international community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime. Most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi-dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.\n\nDuring the genocide and in the months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting the genocide. Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda, who had lost family or friends and sought revenge. The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. Human Rights Watch, as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000, and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings. In an interview with Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. The killings gained international attention after the 1995 Kibeho massacre, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in Butare Province. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed; the Rwandan Government claimed that the death toll was 338.\n\nPaul Kagame took over the presidency from Pasteur Bizimungu in 2000 and began a large-scale national development drive, launching a programme to develop Rwanda as a middle income country by 2020. The country began developing strongly on key indicators, including the human development index, health care, and education. Annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged per year, the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45% between 2006 and 2011, and life expectancy rose from 46.6 years in 2000 to 64.3 years in 2018. A period of reconciliation began as well as the establishment of courts for trying genocide suspects. These included the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and \"Gacaca\", a traditional village court system reintroduced to handle the large caseloads involved.\n\nFollowing the RPF victory, approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide. The camps were crowded and squalid and tens of thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including cholera and dysentery. They were set up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide, who began to rearm in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.\n\nBy late 1996, Hutu militants from the camps were launching regular cross-border incursions and the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched a counter-offensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi group in the Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The refugees fleeing further into Zaire were relentlessly pursued by the RPA under the cover of the AFDL rebellion, killing an estimated 232,000 people. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north-western provinces. By 1999 a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.\n\nAs well as dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning a war to remove Mobutu. Mobutu had supported the \"genocidaires\" based in the camps and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. The Rwandan and Ugandan governments supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The rebels quickly took control of North and South Kivu provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. They controlled the whole country by May 1997. Mobutu fled into exile and the country was renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998 and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the Second Congo War. This lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and severe damage. A 2010 United Nations report accused the Rwandan Patriotic Army of wide-scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity during the two Congo wars, charges denied by the Rwandan Government.\n\nIn 2015 the Rwandan government paid reparations to Uganda for damage inflicted during the civil war to its border regions.\n\n"}

The school originally opened as a branch of the Brisbane Grammar School with fifty students under the direction of a principal, Janet O'Connor.\n\nBrisbane Girls Grammar is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia (AGSA), and is a member of the Queensland Girls' Secondary Schools Sports Association (QGSSSA).\n\nBrisbane Girls Grammar School has approximately 1370 students enrolled in Years 7 to 12.\n\nBrisbane Girls Grammar School was founded in March 1875, six years before women were admitted to universities in Sydney and Melbourne. The school opened as a branch of Brisbane Grammar School with fifty female students under the direction of a lady principal, Janet O'Connor, in premises on George Street, Brisbane. Within six months the school outgrew these premises and subsequently moved to a site on Wickham Terrace.\n\nBy July 1882, the school was well established and a decision was made to separate from Brisbane Grammar School, so as to operate independently under the Grammar Schools Act. Plans were also made to move the school to its present location on Gregory Terrace, Spring Hill. In 1884, the Main Building, designed by architect Richard Gailey, was opened to one hundred students.\n\nThe school's motto is \"Nil Sine Labore\", Latin for \"Nothing Without Labour\". It was adopted from the Brisbane Grammar School, which in turn borrowed it from Horace's Second Book of Satires. The school badge is an open book on a shield with the school motto on a ribbon underneath. The open book was also borrowed from Oxford University, where over half of the original staff of Brisbane Grammar School were originally secured.The School colour is royal blue, adopted from the colours of Brisbane Grammar School, which were originally derived as a compromise between the Oxford colour of light blue and the Cambridge colour of dark blue.\n\nIn 2007, the $25m, six-level Cherrell Hirst Creative Learning Centre opened, winning several awards including the prestigious Sir Zelman Cowen Award for public architecture in 2008. In 2009 a new 25 metre suspended swimming pool and multi-purpose covered area were completed. The Gehrmann Building, constructed in 1986, was renovated in 2011.\n\nIn 2015, the five-storey, $17.4 million Research Learning Centre opened, to coincide with the introduction of Year 7 to the School. Home to a collection of more than 55,000 resources, the Research Learning Centre provides numerous flexible contemporary learning spaces as well as space for individual study.\n\nBrisbane Girls Grammar offers 18 competitive and non-competitive sports. The School is a founding member of the Queensland Girls’ Secondary Schools Sporting Association (QGSSSA) competition, and participates in a range of Brisbane Club associations as well as operating a comprehensive Interhouse programme.\n\nQGSSSA: artistic gymnastics, athletics, badminton, basketball, cricket, cross country, football, hockey, netball, rhythmic gymnastics, softball, swimming, tennis, touch and volleyball. \nCLUB: Fencing (QFA), Rowing (BRSA) and water polo (BWPI)\nLifestyle: Yoga, pilates and rock climbing.\n\nThe three core music domains (strings, band and choir) offer more than 900 places for students to pursue their musical talents at their specific level of proficiency. Specialist music staff provide instrumental and vocal tuition in group and private lessons.\n\nAs with most Australian schools, Brisbane Girls Grammar School utilises a house system. The House System provides a framework of support for students during their years at the school. The House System originated in 1964, with 10 houses that were amalgamated to five in 1966. In 1973 the House System reverted to Interform Competitions but was reintroduced in 1980. Since then, some of the previously discontinued houses have returned, while new houses have been created. There are currently nine houses, each named after past principals and teachers of the school as well as previous chairmen of the Board of Trustees: \nNamed after Sophia Beanland, the former Head Mistress of the school from 1882 to 1889. The house was first established in 1964 when the school had ten Houses, each with approximately fifty students. Beanland House and four other houses were discontinued in 1966, as the system of ten houses was not manageable. Beanland House was reintroduced in 1994.\nNamed after John Edwyn England, one of the longest serving trustees of the school. He was a member of the trust for 20 years and was Chairman of the Board from 1952 to 1961.\nOriginally formed in 1964 and lasted until 1973 when the House System was discontinued in favour of a horizontal division based on year groups. Gibson House was officially reconstituted in February 1980 after a gap of seven years and is named in honour of Major John Lockhart Gibson, M.D. one of Brisbane's best-known doctors. Gibson was appointed Vice-Chairman of the School Board of Trustees in 1906. From 1929 until his resignation in 1940, he served as Chairman of the Board.\nOriginally established in 1964 and combined with Mackinlay House in 1966 to form a larger Griffith house. It continued in this form until 1973, when the house system was discontinued. Griffith House was officially reconstituted in February 1980 and is named in honour of Sir Samuel Walter Griffith, former Chairman of Trustees, Premier of the Colony of Queensland, Chief Justice of Queensland and the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. \nNamed after Konrad Hirschfeld (1904–1987) who served as Chairman of the Board of Brisbane Girls Grammar School between 1963 and 1976. Hirschfeld was involved in many aspects of the medical profession and also had an enduring passion and commitment to education. Hirschfeld House was formed in 1980 in recognition of his services to education and the school. \nOne of nine houses established in 1964. Lilley House was named after Sir Charles Lilley, the former Premier and Chief Justice of Queensland, and the founder of Brisbane Girls Grammar School. Particularly influential in the educational arena, Sir Charles Lilley had a substantial influence on the Education Act 1875 and was responsible for the introduction of free education in Queensland in 1870.\nStarted in 1998 and named after Margaret Annie Mackay, a pupil at the school in its early days. She became a teacher at Brisbane Girls Grammar School and was appointed Head Mistress in 1916. She retired in 1924.\nNamed after Brisbane Girls' Grammar School's first Headmistress, Janet O'Connor. From 1875 to 1877, O'Connor led the fledgeling school which was then located on George Street. O'Connor House was established in 1964 and was discontinued in 1966. In 1990, it was re-established and adopted maroon as its colour.\nFirst established in 1964 and named after John Laskey Woolcock in recognition of his contribution to the School and to education in general. In 1966, Woolcock and O'Connor Houses combined, keeping the name Woolcock. In 1973 the House was discontinued but was re-established in 1980.\n\nIn addition to the main school site at Gregory Terrace, Spring Hill, the school has a Sports Campus in the Brisbane suburb of Fig Tree Pocket and an outdoor education campus, Marrapatta, in the Mary Valley.\n\nBrisbane Campus, Gregory Terrace, Spring Hill\n\nSince 1884, Brisbane Girls Grammar has continually developed their main campus. Recent building projects include the Cherrel Hirst Creative Learning Centre, opened in 2007 to house music, drama, computer technology and art facilities, and a 25-metre suspended swimming pool in 2009. In 2015, to coincide with the introduction of Year 7, the school developed the Research Learning Centre.\n\nMarrapatta Memorial Outdoor Education Centre\n\nThe school operates a dedicated Outdoor Education Centre in the Mary Valley at Imbil, approximately 2 hours drive north of Brisbane.\n\nRangakarra Recreational and Environmental Education Centre\n\nIn 2013, Brisbane Girls Grammar School acquired a 13-hectare site in Fig Tree Pocket, which comprises two playing fields and three ovals. It is from the CBD and is the home ground for sports such as hockey, cricket and touch. The campus is also used to teach environmental sciences, with school groups working with local organisations to rehabilitate areas of ecological significance. The site was officially named Rangakarra Recreational and Environmental Education Centre on 23 May 2015 and the Main Field was renamed the Daphne Welch (1949) Oval in honour of past student and sporting legend Daphne Pirie (Welch) MBE, AO.\n\n\n"}

The band consisted of vocalist Steve Isaacs formerly of Skycycle three Jane's Addiction members: Dave Navarro (guitar), Chris Chaney (bass), and Stephen Perkins (drums, percussion). The band released one studio album, entitled \"(ONe)\" in 2006, and entered an indefinite hiatus in 2007.\n\nFormed in the wake of Jane's Addiction's third split in early 2004, The Panic Channel featured guitarist Dave Navarro, bassist Chris Chaney, and drummer Stephen Perkins, all formerly of Jane's Addiction, as well as vocalist Steve Isaacs, formerly of the band Skycycle. The band's name refers to a state of panic induced by the world media as well as \"channeling the energy inside and outside the room when we create these songs. We like to think of creating music as a way to channel the panic into something tangible,\" as stated by Navarro.\n\nThe band's sole album, \"(ONe)\", was released on August 15, 2006 via Capitol Records. According to the band's official website, the album's name refers to numerous aspects of the band: the debut album for the band (the first, or album number \"one\"), the Panic \"Channel\" being \"ON\", and there being \"nothing more than ONE, spiritually speaking.\" Also according to the website, the parentheses represents everything being held together in \"this age of panic.\" Currently, the band has released two singles – one radio single, \"Why Cry\", and one internet single, \"Teahouse of the Spirits\". Both of these songs, as well as \"She Won't Last\" and \"Bloody Mary\", can be heard on the band's MySpace page. The song \"Teahouse of the Spirits\" also appears on Madden NFL 07.\n\nOn September 6, 2006, on CBS's \"\", it was announced the band would join Supernova on a 28-city tour.\n\nIn January 2007, it was announced that Siggy Sjursen of Powerman 5000 would be joining The Panic Channel as a touring bassist, replacing Chris Chaney who was said to be unable to tour due to family obligations. Initially, Chaney was said to still be a member of the band, but Sjursen was later announced as a permanent replacement.\n\nDave Navarro and Stephen Perkins reunited with Jane's Addiction in 2008. However, on his radio show \"Dark Matter\" on 6 August 2009, Navarro said he had spoken to both Perkins and Chaney about re-forming The Panic Channel, with Steve Isaacs' residence in New York City being the main problem. He has meanwhile moved back to Los Angeles. Navarro urged fans to go on to Twitter to send Isaacs messages encouraging him to re-unite with the band.\n\n\n"}

Mrs. Sally McGuire Tobin christened the ship on 25 August 1990. Construction and fitting out progressed on schedule and, on 14 August 1990, Lieutenant Commander Jerald Tyler Ballance, USNR, accepted \"Pioneer\" on behalf of the Navy from Mr. Ellsworth Peterson of Peterson Builders. \"Pioneer\" began her commissioned service on 1 September 1992 and, after completing initial crew training, sailed to her new homeport of NS Ingleside, Texas. \"Pioneer\" was formally commissioned on 7 December 1992, a tribute to the many U.S. servicemen who had served at Pearl Harbor.\n\nIn January 1993, \"Pioneer\" began an intense shakedown year filled with numerous evaluations, training periods, exercises, and inspections. These included the first major mine warfare exercise in the western Gulf of Mexico, two visits to the Magnetic Silencing Facility in Charleston, South Carolina, port visits to Port Canaveral and Port Everglades, Florida, an Operational Propulsion Plant Examination, Combat Systems Qualification and Testing in Panama City, Florida, mine sweeping performance trials, Final Contract Trials, and a Logistic Management Assessment. For the remainder of 1993 and throughout 1994, \"Pioneer\" continued her aggressive training cycle and conducted post-shakedown maintenance, repairs, and pre-deployment exercises.\n\nIn February 1995, \"Pioneer\" set sail for Europe on her maiden cruise. During this deployment, \"Pioneer\" participated in Exercise Blue Harrier '95 and visited Bermuda, Portsmouth England, Aarhus Denmark, Kiel Germany, Russia, Azores, La Spezia Italy, and Cartagena, Spain, Palma de Mallorca and Benidorm Spain. During her visit to St. Petersburg, the \"Pioneer\" and her crew were greeted by hundreds of Russians; eager to see the Americans that had arrived to participate in the 50th Anniversary of V-E day. She returned to Ingleside in August and, after a well-deserved break, began her next training cycle.\n\nIn January 1996, \"Pioneer\" joined , , and as a training ship for the Mine Force's Rotational Crews. For the next four years, the Navy's eight Mine Countermeasures Rotational Crews conducted their pre-deployment training in these Ingleside-based ships before completing a six-month deployment in the Persian Gulf in or . But by early 2000, the Navy no longer manned its forward-deployed MCM ships with rotational crews, and on 20 January 2000, the remaining members of MCM Rotational Crew BRAVO embarked in \"Pioneer\"—a ship they knew well—as her permanent crew. \"Pioneer\" now serves in Mine Countermeasures Squadron 1 (MCMRon 1), the squadron responsible for planning and overseeing the Navy's Mine Countermeasures operations in the Western Pacific.\n\nThe crew moved aboard and quickly made the ship their home by resealing decks, painting, and generally taking ownership. Along with this came a plethora of repairs and upgrades, which increased \"Pioneer\"s material readiness. \"Pioneer\" then completed a successful CART II and N43 visit and made its way to Panama City, Florida for a Squadron 1 exercise. En route to this exercise, LCDR Samuel Norton relieved CDR Clay Harris as Commanding Officer of \"Pioneer\". The crew remained focussed and performed admirably during the Mine Warfare Exercise. Following a brief port visit to Tampa, Florida, the ship returned to Ingleside, Texas to complete preparations for another mine warfare exercise (GOMEX 2000). \"Pioneer\" participated in the exercise off the coast of Corpus Christi, Texas and the ship and crew's performance was outstanding. With precision and polish, they led the way for mine countermeasures. Members of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 3's Detachment 15 aided \"Pioneer\" in this task.\n\n\"Pioneer\" then prepared to make its first extended underway period with a permanent crew since 1995. On 12 September 2000 \"Pioneer\" set off for Beaumont, Texas for Navy Days, its first stop on an East Coast cruise. During this period \"Pioneer\" participated in Unified Spirit 2000, a multi-national exercise off the coast of North Carolina. \"Pioneer\" again identified and neutralized its fair share of mines, aided by members of Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic 8, a Canadian Explosive Ordnance Disposal dive team. The crew worked well with the divers, and claimed a few victories with its Mine Neutralization Vehicle, performing the first live activation of a Mission Package One cutter arm since USS \"Pioneer\" gained its permanent crew, bringing a moored mine safely to the surface and completing the neutralization and recovery.\n\n\"Pioneer\" then began her journey back to homeport, stopping again in NAB Little Creek, Virginia and briefly in Key West, Florida en route to Mobile, Alabama—the last stop before returning to Ingleside. In Mobile \"Pioneer\" was once again greeted by the warm southern hospitality for the members of the Mobile Navy League and the people of Mobile as a whole. \"Pioneer\" bid Mobile a fond farewell as she traveled to Ingleside, Texas returning on 15 December 2000.\n\nFollowing the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, \"Pioneer\" was ordered out-to-sea as a part of Joint Task Force Katrina. During her underway time, \"Pioneer\" was tasked with conducting sonar sweeps and maritime safety checks of the shipping lanes off the coast of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi.

It was formerly known as Murray Bay.\n\nThe development of tourism in this area is said to date back to 1760, when the Scottish feudal lords John Nairne and Malcolm Fraser began receiving visitors to the region at their estates. The Manoir Richelieu (currently serving as a hotel) and Casino de Charlevoix are both located in the neighbourhood and former municipality of Pointe-au-Pic.\n\nIn 1608, Samuel de Champlain visited the area. He could not find suitable anchorage for his ship in the bay and therefore named it \"Malle Baye\" (archaic French for \"bad bay\"), a name further justified when during low tide the bay dried up and his ships ran aground.\n\nIn 1761, two Scottish officers of the British Army were attracted to the beauty of the place, and they each sought to obtain a concession. John Nairne (1731–1802) received the western shores of the Malbaie River, that he thereafter called the Seignory of Murray Bay that included the settlement of La Malbaie. Malcolm Fraser (1733–1815) was granted the eastern part that became the Seignory of Mount Murray. They also renamed the bay, the settlement, and river after James Murray (1721–1794), British General and successor of Wolfe. Although this name never received official approval, in the 18th and 19th centuries Murray Bay had become the internationally accepted toponym, but La Malbaie remained in local use.\n\nIn 1774, the Parish of Saint-Étienne was formed. In 1845, the place was first incorporated as the Municipality of La Malbaie, but it was abolished in 1847.\n\nMurray Bay is the site of the summer home of the Taft family, including U.S. President William Howard Taft. The residents of Murray Bay were very demonstrative in their affection for Taft, referring to him as \"le petit juge,\" lifting their caps to him as he drove by, and performing burlesque sketches during the winter months in which he was played by the largest villager. They burned a candle at the time of his death, and spat upon hearing of his betrayal by Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1957, Saint-Étienne-de-Murray-Bay was renamed to Saint-Etienne-de-la-Malbaie. A year later, the Village Municipality of La Malbaie changed status and became the Town of La Malbaie, that annexed the parish municipality in 1965.\n\nOn February 15, 1995, the Town of La Malbaie and the Village Municipality of Pointe-au-Pic merged to form the Town of La Malbaie–Pointe-au-Pic. On December 1, 1999, the Municipalities of Rivière-Malbaie and Saint-Fidèle, the Village Municipality of Cap-à-l'Aigle, the Parish Municipality of Sainte-Agnès, and the Town of La Malbaie–Pointe-au-Pic were amalgamated to form the new Town of La Malbaie.\n\nLa Malbaie is the seat of the judicial district of Charlevoix.\n\nIn June 2018, La Malbaie hosted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and world leaders at the 44th G7 summit.\n\nLa Malbaie is located in the Charlevoix Seismic Zone, which is the most active seismic zone in Eastern Canada. La Malbaie is notable for having an extremely high seismic risk, although a significant earthquake has not occurred in the region recently.\n\n\nThe following is a list of Mayors of La Malbaie.\n\nThe Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu is a hotel under the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts banner. The first hotel was built in 1899; the current building was completed in 1929 to replace the first building destroyed by a fire.\n\nThe building was acquired by Fairmont in 1998 and re-opened under the current banner in 1999. The hotel hosted the 44th G7 summit on June 8–9, 2018.\n\n\n"}

They are sequels to the Game Boy Color game \"Robopon\". Their simultaneous release is similar to how the \"Pokémon\" series of video games are released in pairs of games (such as \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\") to promote inter-connectivity between them.\n\nThe games are a sequel to the earlier 2000 Game Boy Color game \"Robopon Sun\". The \"Robopon\" bears much similarity to Nintendo's series of \"Pokémon\" games, and thus is often considered to be a \"Pokémon\" clone, but also bears similarity to the lesser known Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Robotrek\", released by the Japanese game company Enix (now Square Enix).\n\nAfter the events of the first game, the now number one Legend of Porombo Island, Cody, sets out for new lands and new titles, but forgets his Robopon. Before he can turn back to retrieve them, his boat is wrecked in a storm, and he washes up on the continent of Majiko. He decides to become the Robopon champion of this land; however, in order to do this, he must obtain the one-of-a-kind XStones and challenge the rank-holders of Majiko. As he collects the XStones, however, he finds the towns of Majiko are troubled by events past and present, and he must travel between the world of 20 years ago and the present to make things right.\n\nWithin both versions of \"Robopon 2\", Robopon can be created by finding different types of batteries and combining them (this process in known as \"sparking\"). Each different combination of batteries produces a different type of Robopon. \"Robopon 2\" also builds upon the battle system of the first game by implementing four-on-four battles, allowing the player's whole party of Robopons to participate in one big battle. Subsequently, targeting certain enemies within battles becomes crucial. Another less drastic change from \"Robopon\" is the ability to change the colour of the player's Robopon.\n\nBoth \"Robopon 2\" games received \"average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n"}

It provides significant transportation in the area.\n\nMost of the streams that ultimately form the Apure originate in the Venezuelan highlands of the Cordillera de Mérida and only some minor affluents of the Sarare River come from the Cordillera Oriental in the Colombian Andes, entering Venezuela at the confluence with the Oirá River which has a very narrow and steep valley and forms the border between the two countries for . The Oirá River starts in Venezuela and its thalweg forms that border for several kilometres downstream. The Uribante River is longer than the Sarare and flows from the Táchira-Mérida border, near the town of Pregonero. The Apure's drainage area thus includes the slopes of both the Colombian (less than 0.5 percent of its total area) and the Venezuelan Andes.\n\nFrom the point where the Uribante joins the Sarare, the Apure flows eastward across the Venezuelan llanos, into the Orinoco. The Apure flows primarily through Apure State including San Fernando before joining the Orinoco River via six braided river branches west of Cabruta, Guárico State, across from Caicara, Bolívar State, at about . The Apure is long from the Uribante's starting point to the Orinoco. It is navigable for about above the Orinoco, where it has a sluggish course across the llanos, despite rapids at about the mark. From the north, its principal tributaries are the Caparo, Portuguesa and Guarico. The Caucagua is its only major tributary from the south. Because of the flatness of the land its meanders and bayous to the south are mingled with those of the Arauca River creating an extensive area which is flooded annually. However, both rivers keep independent channels during dry season.\n\n"}

He was a Member of Parliament and former co-leader of the Green Party. Norman resigned as an MP in October 2015 to work as Executive Director of Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\nNorman was born in Brisbane, Australia, and worked a number of unskilled roles after dropping out of medical school. As a student in Queensland, his first ever vote in 1986 was motivated by the desire to oust the Premier of Queensland at the time, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Whilst living in Australia, Norman was involved with the Democratic Socialist Party for several years, and contested the House of Representatives for the party at the 1990 federal election, placing fifth of five candidates in the seat of Griffith.\n\nNorman moved to New Zealand in 1997, saying this was to observe the red-green Alliance coalition. He wrote his political science PhD thesis on the Alliance, and was active within the party, editing its party newsletter.\n\nIn New Zealand Norman became involved in organic farming, and was active in the Auckland branch of the Green Party, helping to set up the Waikehe branch.\n\nLater, he worked as an assistant to Green MPs Sue Kedgley, Nándor Tánczos and Keith Locke. He was a researcher for the party from 2002 to 2004 and was the national campaign manager prior to the 2005 election and the national Party Development Co-ordinator afterwards.\n\nFollowing the death of Rod Donald, Norman put his name forward as a contender for the male co-leader position. He won the position on 3 June 2006 at the annual meeting, beating Tanczos, David Clendon and former MP Mike Ward in an STV vote by delegates from electorates around the country.\n\nIn the 2002 election general election, Norman contested the Rimutaka electorate, where he placed fourth. He was ranked seventeenth on the Green Party list. In the 2005 election, he did not contest an electorate, but was ranked tenth on the Green Party list. On 27 June 2008 Norman was declared elected to parliament when Tanczos resigned after Ward and Catherine Delahunty, who were above Norman on the party list, agreed to stand aside. In the 2008 general election Norman stood in the Rongotai electorate against senior Labour Cabinet Minister Annette King. He placed third in the electorate, but was second on his party's list, and so was returned to parliament.\n\nNorman stood as the Green Party's candidate for the Mount Albert by-election in 2009, following the resignation of Prime Minister Helen Clark. Norman came third with 12.09% of the vote.\n\nIn June 2010, Norman claimed he was assaulted by Chinese security staff when he protested against a visiting Chinese delegation of the Vice President Xi Jinping with a Tibetan snow lion flag. Norman lodged a complaint of assault with the New Zealand Police and the Speaker of the House, but police did not find enough evidence to substantiate his claims.\n\nIn January 2015, shortly after the birth of his third child, Norman announced he would stand down as co-leader of the Green Party. However, he said he would remain as a Green MP for the foreseeable future. He named what he saw as his key political victories as co-leader as: forcing the Government to reverse its decision to allow mining on Schedule 4 conservation land, and leading a campaign and referendum against National's asset sales programme. Norman was succeeded by James Shaw as co-leader on 30 May 2015. On 11 September 2015, Norman announced that he will resign in October as an MP, and that he will also formally resign from the Green Party, prior to taking on the role of Executive Director of Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand. This enabled the next person on the Green Party list, Marama Davidson, to become a member of parliament. In his valedictory speech in Parliament, he spoke about the loss of democracy in New Zealand, and said there were significant problems regarding access to official information.\n\n Norman and his partner, Katya Paquin (sister of Anna Paquin), live with their two sons and a daughter in Hataitai.\n\nIn 2012 when Norman and David Shearer shaved their heads for a cancer appeal, he revealed that he had had a melanoma mole removed from his forearm at age 15, leaving a 10 cm scar.\n\nIn 2014, Norman was awarded a Bravo award by the New Zealand Skeptics for responding to Steffan Browning's comments on homeopathy stating, \"stating that this was not something the Green Party would support as they take 'an evidence based approach.'\"\n\n"}

Her mother claimed the Principality of Antioch for herself, but the nobles supported her son, Maria's brother Bohemund III. King Baldwin III of Jerusalem set Bohemund III up as prince and appointed as regent the rich and worldly Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch and an old opponent of Raynald. Constance protested this decision in Constantinople at the court of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos, the nominal overlord of Antioch.\n\nAt the end of 1159, Manuel's wife Empress Eirene (originally named Bertha of Sulzbach) had died, and Manuel wanted to marry a princess from one of the Crusader states. John Kontostephanos, the chief \"dragoman\" (interpreter) Theophylact, and the \"akolouthos\" of the Varangian Guard Basil Kamateros were sent to Jerusalem to seek a new wife, and the two princesses Maria of Antioch and Melisende of Tripoli, a daughter of Count Raymond II of Tripoli by Hodierna of Jerusalem, were offered as candidates. Both were renowned for their beauty, but according to John Kinnamos Maria was the more beautiful of the two; the tall, blonde-haired princess clearly showed her Norman ancestry. King Baldwin III suggested Melisende, and her brother Count Raymond III of Tripoli set about gathering an enormous dowry, with gifts from Hodierna and from Melisende's namesake, her aunt Queen Melisende. The ambassadors were not satisfied and delayed the marriage for over a year; they had apparently heard rumours concerning Hodierna's infidelity and therefore Melisende's possible legitimacy. Instead, Manuel chose Maria. Count Raymond was insulted and in retaliation attacked Byzantine Cyprus.\n\nMeanwhile, an imperial embassy led by Alexios Bryennios Komnenos and the prefect of Constantinople, John Kamateros, came to Antioch to negotiate the marriage. Maria embarked from the port of St. Simeon for Constantinople in September 1161, and the marriage took place in Hagia Sophia on December 24. Three patriarchs performed the marriage: Luke Chrysoberges, Patriarch of Constantinople; Sophronios, Greek Patriarch of Alexandria, and Athanasios I, Greek Patriarch of Antioch. The marriage was celebrated with feasts, gifts to the church, and chariot races in the Hippodrome for the people. This strengthened the connection of Antioch to the Byzantine Empire. The marriage also strengthened the position of Maria's mother Constance, who now held the regency of Antioch. According to Niketas Choniates, Maria\n\n\"...was like unto the laughter-loving, golden Aphrodite, the white-armed and ox-eyed Hera, the long-necked and beautiful ankled Laconian, whom the ancients deified for their beauty, and all the rest of the beauties whose good looks have been preserved in distinguished books and histories.\"\n\nFor several years, Maria was childless. In 1166 she had her first pregnancy, but miscarried a son, a fact which was considered a tragedy by the Emperor and the population. In 1169 Maria finally gave birth to a son, the future emperor Alexios II Komnenos. She played a role in the political and diplomatic life of Constantinople. French being her mother tongue, she was able to observe the double-dealing of the \"hypoboleus\" (court interpreter) Aaron Isaakios, who was quietly advising Westerners not to pay too much for the Emperor's favour. As a result, Manuel had Aaron blinded.\n\nAfter the death of Manuel in 1180, Maria officially became a nun with the name \"Xene\" (translated \"foreigner\"), but in reality she acted as regent for their son Alexios II. Despite being a nun she had many ambitious suitors, but she chose another Alexios, the \"prōtosebastos\" and \"prōtovestiarios\", a nephew of Manuel and uncle of Maria Komnene, former queen of Jerusalem, as an advisor and lover, causing a scandal among the Greek population. As a Westerner who favoured the Italian merchants, Maria was opposed by the Greeks, and her regency was widely considered incompetent. \n\nThe leaders of the opposition were her stepdaughter, the \"porphyrogenita\" Maria Komnene and her husband, the Caesar Renier of Montferrat, though himself a fellow Latin. The \"porphyrogenita\" Maria may have considered herself the rightful heir, as the elder child of Manuel; she was almost as old as her stepmother Maria. Maria and Renier gained the support of the Patriarch Theodosius I and used Hagia Sophia as a base of operations. Alexios had the patriarch arrested, leading to open warfare on the streets of Constantinople.\n\nManuel's cousin Andronikos Komnenos, who had been exiled during Manuel's reign, was invited back by the \"porphyrogenita\" Maria, and marched on Constantinople in 1182. He provoked the citizens into a massacre of the Latin inhabitants, mostly Venetian and Genoese merchants. \n\nAfter gaining control of the city, he had the Porphyrogenita and Renier poisoned, and then had Empress Maria arrested and imprisoned in the monastery of St. Diomedes or in a prison nearby. The empress tried to seek help from her brother-in-law King Béla III of Hungary, to no avail. Andronikos had Alexios II sign the order for his mother's execution, and appointed his own son Manuel and the \"sebastos\" George to execute her, but they refused. Instead, according to Niketas, Maria was strangled by the \"hetaireiarches\" Constantine Tripsychos and the eunuch Pterygeonites, and buried in an unmarked grave on a nearby beach. \n\nPresumably owing to the secrecy surrounding her death, alternative versions of her death circulated, such as that she was tied up in a sack and drowned.

{"id": "1796740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796740", "title": "Doctor shopping", "text": "Doctor shopping\n\nDoctor shopping is the practice of visiting multiple physicians to obtain multiple prescriptions for otherwise illegal drugs, or the medical opinion that one wants to hear. It is a common practice of drug addicts, suppliers of drug addicts, hypochondriacs or patients of factitious disorder and factitious disorder imposed on another. A doctor who, for a price, will write prescriptions without the formality of a medical exam or diagnosis is known as a \"writer\" or \"writing doctor\".\n\nA doctor shopper will visit multiple health care providers as a \"new patient\" or \"visiting from out of town,\" and will exaggerate or feign medical problems to obtain prescriptive medications or a wanted medical opinion, diagnosis or treatment with no specific material gain.\n\nFrequently involved in prescription fraud are narcotics, stimulants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tranquilizers and other psychoactive substances manufactured for use in legitimate medical treatment. Law enforcement officers spend a significant amount of time investigating cases involving prescription fraud, many of which also involve insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid fraud.\n\nPrescription drug diversion occurs by faking, forging, or altering a prescription; obtaining bogus prescriptions from criminal medical practitioners; or buying drugs diverted from health care facilities by personnel. Pharmacy thefts are increasing throughout the United States to feed the growing demand for prescription drugs. The rising cost of prescription drugs has also enticed senior citizens to join in the diversion and to sell their prescriptions.\n\nDoctor shopping is a kind of malingering with the specific goal of procuring prescription drugs. Malingering is underdiagnosed, often because of the physician's fear of making false accusations. Covert surveillance has indicated that as many as 20% of pain clinic patients misrepresent the extent of their disability. The judgment of the morality of malingering is largely a matter of the observer and circumstances. Most people would regard the defraudment of an insurance company, by a false injury, as an antisocial act. In contrast, the malingering of a prisoner-of-war, who is attempting to manipulate his or her captors, would be seen by most compatriots as a skillful coping mechanism.\n\nDoctor shopping is associated with the ubiquitous medicalization of drug use, as an alternative to criminalization and legalization.\n\nSome patients of hypochondria, factitious disorder and factitious disorder imposed on another will visit multiple health care providers to find a medical opinion, diagnosis or treatment that they feel the need to get, not specifically in search of prescription drugs, for no material benefit and even incurring in significant costs, debts or losses. This kind of doctor shopping lacks intention to commit malingering for material gain and is the result of such mental conditions.\n\n"}

She was the third ship named USS \"Hopkins\" and the third named for Esek Hopkins.\n\n\"Hopkins\" was launched 26 June 1920 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Miss Sarah Babbitt, a descendant of Esek Hopkins; and commissioned 21 March 1921 at Philadelphia, Lieutenant Commander C. A. Bailey commanding.\n\nAfter shakedown \"Hopkins\" arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, 31 May for battle practice training during the summer. In November, she was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 15 for tactical training with the Atlantic Fleet along the East Coast.\n\n\"Hopkins\" sailed from Hampton Roads 2 October 1922, and reached Constantinople 22 October for duty in Turkish waters. She protected American interests and cooperated with the relief mission in the Near East, ranging to Beirut, Jaffa, and Smyrna. She departed Constantinople 18 May 1923 for New York, arriving 12 June. For the next seven years, \"Hopkins\" operated out of New England ports in the summer, Charleston, South Carolina, in the winter, and the Caribbean Sea in the spring. During the spring of 1930, \"Hopkins\" participated in force battle practice with aircraft.\n\nOn 3 February 1932, \"Hopkins\" was one of the two naval ships rendering medical aid to earthquake victims at Santiago, Cuba. She departed 5 February to join the Pacific Fleet at San Diego, California. She had escort duty for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's cruise to Canada in July 1936, then resumed training along the Western Seaboard.\n\n\"Hopkins\" returned to Norfolk, Virginia in April 1939, and performed Neutrality Patrol from September 1939 until sailing for San Diego 37 May, and from there to Pearl Harbor. She converted to a high-speed minesweeper (DMS-13) in the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.\n\nWhen the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, \"Hopkins\" was at Johnston Island for war maneuvers, but immediately headed back to Hawaii. She continued patrol of the Hawaiian Sea Frontier, with a short break for overhaul in the States, until late summer 1942, when she joined the invasion fleet bound for Guadalcanal. As America's first offensive of the Pacific war began 7 August, \"Hopkins\" swept the transport area and covered the landings on Tulagi. During a heavy enemy air attack 9 August, she shot down two enemy planes, and in the following months, \"Hopkins\" escorted transports, swept mines, and carried badly needed supplies to Guadalcanal.\n\n\"Hopkins\" served as flagship for Admiral Richmond K. \"Kelly\" Turner as the Russell Islands were invaded 21 February 1943. During the action, she shot down a Japanese plane. Remaining in the southwest Pacific, she joined in the initial invasion of Rice Anchorage, New Georgia, 4 July, and of Bougainville 1 November. Convoy escort, antisubmarine patrol, and sweeping duties kept the destroyer busy until the Solomon Islands were secured.\n\nAs the Navy moved farther across the Pacific in the island-hopping campaign, \"Hopkins\" arrived off Saipan 13 June 1944 to sweep the invasion approaches. She provided screen and fire support for the amphibious landings of 15 June 1944. She picked up 62 prisoners from sunken Japanese ships as well as rescuing a downed fighter pilot and a seaplane crew. A brief rest at Eniwetok was followed by a role in the capture of Guam. \"Hopkins\" reached that important Marianas island 14 July to participate in the preinvasion sweeping and bombardment. She also gave fire-support to the landings 16 July.\n\nFollowing overhaul at San Francisco, CA, \"Hopkins\" arrived in Leyte Gulf 27 December 1944 to prepare for the Lingayen landings. The minesweepers sailed 2 January 1945 to sweep Lingayen Gulf under attack from Japanese dive bombers and \"kamikazes\". When her sister ship was hit and sank in 13 minutes the morning of 7 January, \"Hopkins\" rescued 94 survivors.\n\n\"Hopkins\" departed the Philippines 15 January 1945 for a brief rest at Eniwetok, then swept the transport areas and channels off Iwo Jima to prepare for invasion 19 February 1945. She remained on patrol off Iwo Jima, emerging from heavy air and shore fire unscathed. Departing Iwo Jima 6 March, \"Hopkins\" next headed into battle off Okinawa, the \"last stepping stone to Japan.\" While fighting off the constant raids and suicide attacks she shot down several Japanese planes. On 4 May 1945 she was struck a glancing blow by a burning \"kamikaze\" just before it plunged into the sea. There was one casualty during this attack. Coxswain Morris Dee Garrett was the only casualty on that day and was the only casualty from the USS Hopkins during World War II.\n\nOn 7 June 1945, \"Hopkins\" steamed for overhaul at Leyte, Philippine Islands where she remained until cessation of hostilities. \"Hopkins\" then rendezvoused with units of the 3rd Fleet headed for Tokyo Bay. After two days of sweeping the entrances to Tokyo Bay, \"Hopkins\" anchored in sight of Mount Fuji 30 August 1945. \"Hopkins\" rode out two typhoons with winds raging to 125 knots before her departure from Tokyo Bay 10 October 1945 for the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.\n\n\"Hopkins\" arrived in Norfolk 28 November and decommissioned there 21 December 1945. She was sold for scrapping 8 November 1946 to Heglo Sales Corporation, Hillsdale, New Jersey.\n\n\"Hopkins\" was awarded two Navy Unit Commendations for heroism off Guadalcanal and in Lingayen Gulf. She also received 10 battle stars for her service in World War II. \"Hopkins\" is the most decorated member of the Clemson-class destroyers.\n\n\n"}

Slowly expanding, it became, in medieval times, a fief of the Clavesana marquis, who was a subject of the Republic of Genoa, to which Cervo had always been faithful. The present character of Cervo dates from these times: 16th-century towers and ramparts still protect the village.\n\nOne of its main attractions is the fine baroque church of St. John the Baptist, overlooking the sea. The Romanesque Oratorio di Santa Caterina contain 18th-century frescoes. The medieval Clavesana stronghold hosts the Ethnographic Museum of Western Liguria and the Palazzo Viale-Citati.\n\nInhabitants used to earn a living from coral fishing in the Corsican and Sardinian seas, in addition to growing olives and seafaring, but the modern economy of Cervo is based on tourism and agriculture.\n\nCervo's connections with classical music date from to 1964, when the International Chamber Music Festival of Cervo was established by the Hungarian violinist Sandor Vegh.

{"id": "1796746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796746", "title": "Theophilus (biblical)", "text": "Theophilus (biblical)\n\nTheophilus is the name or honorary title of the person to whom the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles are addressed (, ). It is thought that both the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles were written by the same author, and often argued that the two books were originally a single unified work. Both Luke and Acts were written in a refined Koine Greek, and the name \"θεόφιλος\" (\"Theophilos\"), as it appears therein, means \"friend of God\" or \"(be)loved by God\" or \"loving God\" in the Greek language. No one knows the true identity of Theophilus and there are several conjectures and traditions around an identity. In English Theophilus is also written \"Theophilos\", both a common name and an honorary title among the learned (academic) Romans and Jews of the era. The life of Theophilus would coincide with the writing of Luke and the author of the Acts.\n\nCoptic tradition asserts that Theophilus was a person and not an honorary title. The Coptic Church claims that the person was a Jew of Alexandria. Similarly, John Wesley in his Notes on the New Testament recorded that Theophilus was \"a person of eminent quality at Alexandria\", which he understood to be the tradition 'of the ancients'.\n\nOthers say that Theophilus was probably a Roman official of some sort, because Luke referred to him as \"κρατιστε\", \"optime\" in the Latin Vulgate translation, meaning \"most excellent\" (), although in the parallel introduction to Acts he is simply referred to as 'O Theophilus'.\n\nHonorary title (academia) tradition maintains that Theophilus was not a person. The word in Greek means \"Friend of God\" and thus both Luke and Acts were addressed to anyone who fits that description. In this tradition the author's targeted audience, as with all other canonical Gospels, were the learned (academic) but unnamed men and women of the era. Likewise the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, and Gospel of James are not addressed to any particular gender, or any specific person.\n\nSome believe that Theophilus could have been Paul's lawyer during his trial period in Rome. To support this claim people appeal to the formal legalese present in the prologue to the Gospel such as \"eye witnesses\", \"account\", \"carefully investigated\", \"know the certainty of things which you have been instructed\". The conclusion of the Book of Acts ends with Paul still alive and under arrest awaiting trial, suggesting it was the intention of the author to update Theophilus on Paul's history to provide for an explanation of his travels and preaching and serve as evidence in support of his innocence under Roman law. Some also point to the parallel between the account of Jesus' trial before Pontius Pilate narrated in Luke's Gospel with the account of Paul's trials before Roman judges in the Book of Acts. In total, Jesus was declared innocent 3 times by Pontius Pilate as was Paul before various judges.\n\nA growing belief points to Theophilus ben Ananus, High Priest of the Temple in Jerusalem from 37 to 41. In this tradition Theophilus would have been both a kohen and a Sadducee. That would make him the son of Annas and brother-in-law of Caiaphas, raised in the Jewish Temple. Adherents claim that Luke's Gospel was targeted at Sadducee readers. This might explain a few features of Luke. He begins the story with an account of Zacharias the righteous priest who had a Temple vision of an angel (). Luke quickly moves to account Mary's purification (niddah), Jesus' Temple redemption (pidyon ha-ben) rituals (), and then to Jesus' pilgrimage to the Temple when he was twelve (), possibly implying his bar mitzvah. He makes no mention of Caiaphas' role in Jesus' crucifixion and emphasizes Jesus' literal resurrection (), including an ascension into heaven as a realm of spiritual existence (; ). Luke also seems to stress Jesus' arguments with the Sadducees on points like legal grounds for divorce, the existence of angels, spirits, and an afterlife (Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection of the dead). If this was the case then Luke is trying to use Jesus' rebuttals and teachings to break down Theophilus' Sadducean philosophy, maybe with the hope that Theophilus would use his influence to get the Sadducees to cease their persecution of the Christians. One could also look at Luke's Gospel as an allegorical (רֶמֶז remez) reference to Jesus as \"the man called the Branch\" prophesied in ; , who is the ultimate high priest foreshadowed by the Levitical priesthood.\n\nMost, if not all, of the commentaries on the Gospel of Luke say the \"Question about the Resurrection\" pericope presented in Lk. 20:27-40 is the only account in Luke of Jesus confronting the Sadducees. It is true that Luke only mentions the Sadducees by name once but it is not true that this pericope is the only one concerning the Sadducees. The Parables about the Good Samaritan, the Unjust Steward, the Rich Man and Lazarus and the Wicked Tenants are directed to the Sadducees who controlled the temple establishment. These parables are about unfaithful priests. They are the wicked sons of Eli.\n\nAll of the New Testament passages concerning alms and almsgiving, except one in Matthew, are in Luke-Acts. Therefore, these parables may be about alms, almsgiving and the proper use of the wealth controlled by the temple authorities. Luke's criticism focuses on the use of these temple resources by the religious aristocracy for their own selfish purposes. This means that the religious authorities controlled tremendous wealth that had been in times past properly distributed to the people as part of the institutional form of almsgiving. The priests in these parables are unfaithful, dishonest and disobedient because, inter alia, they have not invited the poor, the maimed, the lame and the blind to the banquet table. Once the office of the High Priest became non-hereditary, and available to the highest bidder, the institutional role of almsgiving was abandoned or reduced as the purchaser had to recoup his purchase price.\n\nA minority view identifies Theophilus as a later high priest: Mattathias ben Theophilus who served from 65 to 66. Note that Luke refers to high priest Joseph ben Caiaphas simply as \"Caiaphas\". Thus, the reasoning goes, Luke used this pattern when addressing Theophilus.\n\n\n"}

He is the former chief political commentator of \"The Daily Telegraph\", from which he resigned in early 2015. He is author of \"The Rise of Political Lying\" and \"The Triumph of the Political Class\", and, with Frances Weaver, the pamphlet \"Guilty Men\". He writes a political column for the \"Daily Mail\" and \"Middle East Eye\".\n\nHe sat as a commissioner for the Citizens Commission on Islam, Participation and Public Life. He won the Press Awards Columnist of the Year in 2012 and again in 2016.\n\nOborne was educated at Sherborne School and read history at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA degree in 1978. After abandoning work on a doctorate, he joined NM Rothschild's corporate finance division in 1981, and stayed there for three years.\n\nHe began working for Robert Maxwell's now closed \"Financial Weekly\" magazine in 1985, being taken on by the editor Mihir Bose. In between two spells on the \"Evening Standard\", the second being more extended, he joined \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 1987 for what turned out to be five months. During his second period on the \"Standard\", he was sent to Westminster in 1992 as a junior political journalist by Paul Dacre, then the \"Standard\"s editor. After moving to the Express titles in 1996, where he was taken on by Sue Douglas as a political commentator, he accepted voluntary redundancy in April 2001 at a time when the titles' new proprietor, Richard Desmond, was attempting to reduce losses.\n\nOborne is the author of a highly critical biography of Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, published in 1999, and a biography of the cricketer Basil D'Oliveira (whose selection for England to tour South Africa in 1968 caused that country's apartheid regime to cancel the tour). Oborne is also a vocal critic of the late Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, and author of a pamphlet, published by the Centre for Policy Studies about the situation in Zimbabwe, \"A moral duty to act there.\"\n\nAs a television journalist, Oborne made three polemical documentaries with filmmaker Paul Yule: \"Mugabe's Secret Famine\" (2003), \"Afghanistan – Here's One We Invaded Earlier\" (2004), and \"Not Cricket – The Basil D'Oliveira Conspiracy\" (2004). When the paperback of Oborne's book on the D'Oliveira affair, \"Basil D'Oliveira, Cricket and Conspiracy: The Untold Story\" was published in 2005, Owen Slot wrote in a review in \"The Times\", that Oborne \"sets it up beautifully: one gentle, conservative Cape Town coloured man versus apartheid at its most rabid, the odds stacked heavily against the former\". Robin Marlar in \"The Sunday Times\" thought \"the positives in this book have it by a mile, the good guys are praised, and the others revealed\". The book was written with D'Oliveira's involvement.\n\nIn an edition of the Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" programme in November 2004, \"The Dirty Race for the White House\", broadcast just before the re-election of George W. Bush, Oborne asserted: \"This US presidential election is about using the darkest tools of political persuasion — fear, lies and black propaganda — in order to target an amazingly small but utterly decisive group of largely ignorant voters\". The historian Andrew Roberts wrote in \"The Times\" that such claims by Oborne as the country's voters being \"ignorant beyond belief\" was a \"staggeringly snobbish, anti-American generalisation\" and that \"it can hardly be blamed on the candidates that they engage the electorate in the vernacular in which they are best likely to be understood\".\n\nIn April 2005, he presented the Channel 4 programme in the \"Election Unspun\" series, \"Why Politicians Can't Tell the Truth\", that examined how major political parties in Britain allegedly pursue an agenda designed to appeal only to a narrow band of floating voters expected to play a decisive role in the UK general elections of 2005. In a \"Dispatches\" broadcast in November 2005, \"Iraq — The Reckoning\", he commented that the 2003 invasion was \"the greatest foreign policy disaster since Munich. And our Government has reacted in precisely the same way: by going into denial. Denial about the role our troops are really playing in Iraq. Denial about the true nature of the emerging Iraqi state. Above all, we’re in denial about the fact that the invasion of Iraq, as conceived by President Bush and Tony Blair, has failed\".\n\nIn April 2006, it was announced that Oborne was taking up a new position at the \"Daily Mail\" as a political columnist, while retaining his connection with \"The Spectator\" as a contributing editor. He had been \"The Spectator\"s political editor since 2001. Fraser Nelson of \"The Scotsman\" replaced Oborne as \"The Spectator\"s political editor.\n\nOborne's book \"The Triumph of the Political Class\" was published in 2007. Simon Jenkins, in a review for \"The Sunday Times\", summarised Oborne's thesis \"in his latest diatribe against Britain's \"ingénue\" ruling class\" as \"Out have gone mandarins, independent advisers, political parties and ministers with experience of life. In has come a tight network of loyalist apparatchiks, quango-crats, lobbyists and City consultants\" in the era of New Labour. Jenkins observed: \"Amid all this sound and fury, it is sometimes hard to discern Oborne's real complaint from his aloof moralism. Much of what he attacks predates Blair\". Oborne wrote some years later: \"Blair falls into the tradition of <nowiki>[</nowiki>Robert<nowiki>]</nowiki> Walpole and <nowiki>[</nowiki>David<nowiki>]</nowiki> Lloyd George\", who greatly enriched themselves in office, although Blair's \"exploitation of the office of prime minister came after he left Downing Street\".\n\nIn July 2008, Oborne presented another \"Dispatches\" programme made for Channel 4 called \"It Shouldn't Happen to a Muslim\". In this film and the accompanying leaflet \"Muslims Under Siege\" co-written with television journalist James Jones, it was argued that the demonisation of Muslims has become widespread in British media and politics. The pamphlet was serialised in \"The Independent\". In an October 2006 \"Guardian\" interview with James Silver, Oborne was against the \"litany of condemnation\" of Muslim women who wear the veil from government ministers and considered it an \"anti-Islamic crusade\". In his opinion, New Labour had \"given up on the Muslim vote after the Iraq war, so it's now bashing Muslims to get back the white working-class vote and the veil row is a very carefully orchestrated political strategy\".\n\nOborne was on the Orwell Prize's Journalism shortlist for 2009.\n\nIn collaboration with James Jones, Oborne wrote the pamphlet \"The Pro-Israel Lobby In Britain\", which outlined the influence allegedly enjoyed by pro-Israeli media and political lobbyists in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe article asserted that while the lobbying efforts of groups such as Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), Labour Friends of Israel, and the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre (BICOM) are legal, their funding is often untraceable, their operations are not transparent, and media seldom declare the influence of junkets arranged by these pro-Israeli entities on the tenor of their writing. Oborne and Jones conclude that changes are needed \"because politics in a democracy should never take place behind closed doors. It should be out in the open and there for all to see.\" On the same issue. Oborne wrote and presented an edition of \"Dispatches\" titled \"Inside Britain's Israel Lobby\", featuring interviews with people mentioned in the pamphlet and commenting on the BBC's refusal to broadcast the 2009 DEC Gaza appeal. \n\nIn December 2012, he argued that the Conservatives' unwillingness to criticise the Israeli government threatens the prospect of a permanent peace in the region.\n\nIn collaboration with Conservative Member of Parliament Jesse Norman, Oborne produced the pamphlet \"Churchill's Legacy – the Conservative case for the Human Rights Act\" in the summer of 2009. Published by Liberty, the pamphlet attempted to show how \"the Act is not a charter for socialism but contains the most basic rights from 900 years of British history\".\n\nIn September 2011, Oborne and Frances Weaver co-authored the pamphlet \"Guilty Men\" for the Centre for Policy Studies written, according to Denis MacShane in \"The Guardian\", with Oborne's \"characteristic rococo exuberance\". According to Oborne and Weaver in a covering article \"the pro-Europeans find themselves in the same situation as appeasers in 1940, or communists after the fall of the Berlin Wall\". The report sought to identify the politicians, institutions and commentators who the authors felt had tried to take Britain into the European Single Currency. The \"Financial Times\", which \"has been wrong on every single major economic judgment over the past quarter century\", in the covering article is accused of a \"vendetta\" against Euro-sceptics. In the report, the \"FT\", BBC and CBI are accused of being \"villains\" and considered the \"propaganda arm for the pro-single\ncurrency movement\". MacShane wrote that the authors' made false claims in the report against the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and he dismisses the idea that the British media \"have been suborned into aiding and abetting a pro-Europe line\" because the press is dominated by a right-wing euro-sceptic agenda.\n\nFollowing the pamphlet's publication, Oborne made frank comments on the BBC programme \"Newsnight\" on 28 September 2011. In the debate about the Greek debt crisis and its effects on the eurozone, he referred to the European Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj Tardio as \"that idiot in Brussels\" which, after he used the phrase for a third time, resulted in Tardio walking out of the studio. (Tardio, spokesman for European Union economic and monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn, was speaking from a studio in Brussels.) Oborne was mocked by \"Newsnight\" presenter Jeremy Paxman for \"gratuituous rudeness\" after Paxman had himself asked for a response from, \"Mr Idiot in Brussels\".\n\nOn 10 May 2012, on the BBC's \"Question Time\" programme, Oborne commented following the jailing of a Rochdale sex trafficking gang, who had been convicted of rape, sexual activity with children and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children having raped, physically assaulted and sexually groomed girls as young as 12. Oborne said the victims had \"accepted the advances\" of their attackers and added: \"What does it tell us about what's happened to our society that we have 12 year old girls, 13 year old girls, who are happy to give up their affection and their beauty to men in exchange for a packet of crisps?\" Some, such as Vicky Allan of \"The Herald\", have claimed that this type of rhetoric amounts to victim blaming, saying that: \"there is a prevalent conviction that young girls are somehow asking for whatever they get as soon as they begin to behave in a sexual manner, or choose to involve themselves with men\".\n\nOborne has been critical of the state of Saudi Arabia - United Kingdom relations as he considers that Saudi Arabia has too much influence over British politicians' decisions due to the value of arms they buy from British-headquartered companies like BAE Systems. In October 2014, his \"Daily Telegraph\" column criticised the British government for launching an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood, apparently on the say-so of the Saudi Arabian government and the Arab lobby. On the Arab lobby, he said: \"Unlike the Pro-Israel lobby (with which it is, nevertheless, very closely allied) there are few obvious institutional structures or pressure points. The British Arab lobby is inchoate. It is powerfully represented at the heart of the British military and intelligence establishments, while its connections with the oil and defence industries remain profound. Relations with the British monarchy run very deep.\" He also called on the British government to end its support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.\n\nWritten with David Morrison, Oborne's book \"A Dangerous Delusion: Why the Iranian Nuclear Threat is a Myth\" (2013) sought to dispel what the authors see as a common misconception of a malign intent behind Iran's nuclear power programme, and objects to the current sanctions against Iran and argues against any military intervention. \"The Times\" leader writer Oliver Kamm disagreed with the author's notion that Ayatollah Khomeini was \"one of the greatest theologians of all time\" whose \"teaching contained insights which went far deeper than anything the rationalists and materialists of the United States could imagine\" suggesting those insights fall somewhat short of the proposals of Thomas Jefferson in the \"Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom\". Of a podcast involving the authors, Douglas Murray asserted that Morrison, with the acquiescence of Oborne, made disingenuous claims about President Ahmadinejad's history of Holocaust denial.\n\nOborne, responding to his critics in an article for \"The Spectator\"s 'Coffee House' blog, complained of the \"scale and (in some cases) virulence that I have never encountered before\" of his and Morrison's opponents. He rejected Kamm and Murray's claims about his co-author, who \"fully accepts\" the veracity of claims against Ahmadinejad. Oborne wrote that \"not one of our critics have even tried to deal with the central, factual points of our short book: that Iran isn’t in possession of nuclear weapons and isn’t building them\". Michael Axworthy thought that \"For the most part, Oborne and Morrison are right and their arguments are strong.\", but Douglas Murray, after quoting Oborne's comment in a response, wrote that \"customers should ask for a refund\". A review by Con Coughlin for \"The Jewish Chronicle\" speculated that Oborne's \"unhappy descent into the world of international fantasy\" owed much to his association with Morrison, and accused \"the authors\" of \"alarming ignorance about the rudimentary principles that underpin the current Iranian regime\" and reports from intelligence sources and the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nOborne had re-joined \"The Daily Telegraph\" in May 2010 from the \"Mail\" to write for the newspaper from the following September.\n\nOn 17 February 2015, Oborne resigned from \"The Daily Telegraph\". In a letter posted to the online news website, openDemocracy, Oborne criticised his former employer for the allegedly unscrupulous relationship between their editorial and commercial arms. Specifically, Oborne outlined how the paper would suppress negative stories and drop investigations into the HSBC bank, a major source of their advertising revenue, which, in his opinion, compromised their journalistic integrity calling it a \"form of fraud on its readers\". He also alleged that \"The Telegraph\"s coverage of stories relating to UK supermarket chain Tesco, shipping company Cunard and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong had been influenced by commercial considerations. He added, \"There are other very troubling cases, many of them set out in \"Private Eye\", which has been a major source of information for \"Telegraph\" journalists wanting to understand what is happening on their paper\".\n\nThe Telegraph group responded to Oborne's claims in a statement: \"We aim to provide all our commercial partners with a range of advertising solutions, but the distinction between advertising and our award-winning editorial operation has always been fundamental to our business. We utterly refute [sic] any allegation to the contrary.\"\n\nMichael White wrote of Oborne at the time: \"What makes him unusual, however, not just among journalists, is his powerful sense of right and wrong\".\n\nIn July 2015, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a report by Oborne in which he and producer Anna Meisel investigated the closure a year earlier of HSBC bank accounts belonging to British Muslim institutions and individuals. He had originally begun his investigation whilst working for \"The Daily Telegraph\" but the newspaper had refused to publish the resultant article, which had been critical of the bank's decision, triggering his decision to resign.\n\nOn 30 June 2015, it was announced that Oborne would rejoin the \"Daily Mail\" with a weekly political column starting in the autumn and write a weekly column in Middle East Eye.\n\nDuring the nomination process for the 2016 United States presidential election, Oborne said that while Hillary Clinton \"for me is a warmonger\" as \"[t]here's never been a war she hasn't supported\", the eventual US President, Donald Trump \"in terms of his foreign policy is actually quite sensible. He doesn't want to get involved\". The Russian government, in his opinion, under Vladimir Putin is among the countries in the world which have \"been converted into a form of pillage by a ruling family, individual or ruling elite\".\n\nThough previously a \"strong Brexiter\", on 7 April 2019, Oborne wrote an article for the UK-based political website openDemocracy suggesting that the Brexit decision needs to be rethought:\n\n\"So I argue, as a Brexiteer, that we need to take a long deep breath. We need to swallow our pride, and think again. Maybe it means rethinking the Brexit decision altogether.\"\nIn October 2019, Oborne wrote a piece in the OpenDemocracy about how journalists and the media are being used by Downing Street to get their false news out, saying \"It’s chilling. From the Mail, The Times to the BBC and ITN, everyone is peddling Downing Street’s lies and smears. They’re turning their readers into dupes.\" \n\nIn an interview with Channel 4 News, he said the journalists, who are being used by the government include the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg and ITV's Robert Peston.\n\nOborne describes himself as a \"regular Anglican churchgoer\", and his wife, Martine, is Vicar at St. Michael's Sutton Court in Chiswick, west London. The couple have five children. Martine Oborne is also a writer and illustrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the only rider to score qualified rides from the 1987 World Champion and 1990 ProRodeo Hall of Fame bull Red Rock. He died in the arena at the 1989 Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo as a result of injuries sustained when the bull Takin' Care of Business struck him after the ride.\n\nAt the time of Lane's birth, his parents lived in Lapoint, Utah. His father, Clyde, was on the rodeo circuit as a saddle bronc and bareback rider. His mother, Elsie, went to stay with her parents in Kim, Colorado, and he was born in the hospital in La Junta. He had an older sister, Robin, and a younger brother, Cody.\n\nFrost started riding dairy calves around age 5–6. His first rodeo awards were won when he was 10, at the \"Little Buckaroos\" Rodeos held in Uintah Basin: first in bareback, second in calf roping, and third in the \"bull riding\" (calf riding) event. He also competed in wrestling in junior high school. The family then moved to Oklahoma and he attended Atoka High School in Atoka. In Oklahoma, he was the National High School Bull Riding Champion in 1981. He was the Bull Riding Champion of the first Youth National Finals in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1982.\n\nOn January 5, 1985, Frost married Kellie Kyle (born 1965), a barrel racer from Quanah, Texas, west of Wichita Falls.\n\nFrost joined the PRCA and began rodeoing full-time after graduating from high school in 1982. In 1987, he became the PRCA World Champion Bull Rider at age 24. That same year, the bull Red Rock, owned by Growney Bros. Rodeo Company, was voted Bucking Bull of the Year. In 309 attempts, no one had ever ridden him, and in 1988, at the Challenge of the Champions, Frost rode him in seven exhibition matches and was successful in four out of seven tries. He went on to compete at the Rodeo '88 Challenge Cup held as part of the Cultural Olympiad in association with the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.\n\nSometime in 1988, John Growney pondered a special competition between the two 1987 Champions. It was decided that Frost and Red Rock would have seven showdowns at different rodeos in states across the West. The event was titled the \"Challenge of the Champions.\" Red Rock was brought out of retirement and Frost finally rode him to the eight-second whistle for a scoring ride for 4 of the 7 matches.\n\nOn July 30, 1989, at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo in Cheyenne, Wyoming, after completing a successful 91-point ride on a Brahma bull named Takin' Care of Business, Frost dismounted and landed in the dirt. The bull turned and hit him in the back with his horn (although he was not gored), breaking several of his ribs. He initially rose to his feet, waving at Tuff Hedeman for help. As he took a couple of steps, he fell to the ground, causing his heart and lungs to be punctured by the broken ribs. He was rushed to Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead. He was 25 years old. No autopsy was performed. He posthumously finished third in the event.\n\nTakin' Care of Business appeared in the 1990 National Finals Rodeo. He was retired in the 1990s, and put out to stud until he died in 1999.\n\nFrost is buried near his hero and mentor, Freckles Brown, in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Hugo, Oklahoma.\n\nAfter Frost's death, Cody Lambert, who currently resides in Bowie, Texas, one of his traveling partners, and a founder of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR), created the protective vest that all professional cowboys now must wear when riding bulls.\nIn 1994, the biopic based on Frost's life, \"8 Seconds\", was released. Luke Perry played the role of Frost. Stephen Baldwin was cast as Tuff Hedeman.\n\nThe medical team for the PBR league is named after Frost, as is the Lane Frost/Brent Thurman Award, given for the highest scoring ride at the PBR World Finals. The Lane Frost Health and Rehabilitation Center in Hugo is dedicated to his memory.\n\nCountry music star Garth Brooks paid tribute to Frost in the video for his 1990 hit single \"The Dance\". Rodeo announcer Randy Schmutz wrote the song \"A Smile Like That\" about him. The 1993 song \"Red Rock\" by the Smokin' Armadillos is about him, and he is mentioned at the end of the video for Korn's 2007 song \"Hold On\". Aaron Watson's 2012 album, \"Real Good Time\", included the single \"July in Cheyenne\". Kings of Leon 2013 music video for Beautiful War pays homage to Lane Frost.\n\nIn August 1990, Frost was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 1999, he was named to the : Ring of Honor, the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame, the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame in Fort Worth. In 2017, he was inducted into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame.\n\nFrost's parents have authorized \"Cowboy Bible: The Living New Testament\", with a sketch of him on the cover. A documentary titled \"The Challenge of the Champions: The Story of Lane Frost and Red Rock\" premiered in 2008. It covers the match between them.\n\nIn 2014, on the 25th anniversary of Frost's death, the \"Wyoming Tribune-Eagle\" published as part of its coverage of Cheyenne Frontier Days an article recalling the highlights of his career and his character. His friend, Cody Lambert, is quoted: \"I'm a John Wayne fan, and I don't mean any disrespect to John Wayne, but he played the characters that Lane really was.\" Sage Kimzey, the champion bull rider from Strong City, Oklahoma, said: \"He's the guy every young bull rider wants to grow up and be like.\" Tuff Hedeman compared Frost's death to that of James Dean: \"gone way too soon.\"\n\nAfter surviving an accident on the last lap of the 2015 Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway, NASCAR Cup Series driver Austin Dillon waved to the crowd with a similar gesture to that of Frost’s; he later stated that it was purposefully in tribute to Frost.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1796774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796774", "title": "Sid Grauman", "text": "Sid Grauman\n\nSidney Patrick Grauman (March 17, 1879 – March 5, 1950) was an American showman who created two of Hollywood's most recognizable and visited landmarks, the Chinese Theatre and the Egyptian Theatre.\n\nHe was the son of David Grauman (who died in 1921 in Los Angeles, California) and Rosa Goldsmith (1853–1936).\nGrauman's parents were theatrical performers on various show circuits.\n\nBorn to Jewish parents, Grauman and his father went to Dawson City, Yukon, for the Gold Rush when he was a young man. He worked there as a paperboy. Since newspapers were scarce, they could command a dollar each. Grauman told a story about a store owner who purchased a newspaper from him for $50. The shopkeeper then read the paper aloud in his store, charging admission to local miners. In the Yukon, the young Grauman learned a lesson which would serve him the rest of his life: that people would willingly pay handsomely for entertainment. Sid and his father began organizing events like boxing matches, which paid them well. It was also in the Yukon that Grauman saw his first motion picture. A failed prospector in the Klondike gold rush, David Grauman initially took his young son to the Klondike with the idea of building a theater there. Though they did not strike gold, both of the Graumans were made considerably wealthy by their Klondike entertainment activities. When his father's sister became ill and he left the territory to care for her, young Grauman remained in Dawson City for a time. His parents settled in San Francisco and Grauman joined them there in 1900.\n\nDavid and his son decided to open a vaudeville theater in San Francisco. Their first venture was on Market Street near Mason called the Unique Theater. Before long they added motion pictures to the vaudeville shows, and another theater called the Lyceum. As the theater manager, though Sid Grauman had seen just about every type of performance, there were some that startled and amazed him, turning down an offer to learn how to swallow swords. The Graumans were also instrumental in establishing the Northwest Vaudeville Company, which stretched from San Francisco to Minneapolis and Portland, Oregon. The association brought quality live entertainment at reasonable prices to the Northwest area of the US.\n\nDavid Grauman tried his hand at expanding his theater business in New York City and the East Coast, where he was far from successful; for a time, Sid worked in Scranton, Pennsylvania at one of the theaters he and his father were interested in. David Grauman suffered enough financial loss to have the need to take a business partner in his Lyceum Theater, and to accept an offer from the partner to buy him out in 1905. He later arranged to take over the lease of the Lyceum, which would then evict his former partner from the theater in 1907. By early 1906, the Graumans had lost their lease of the Unique Theater. The building had been purchased by the president of the Orpheum Theater circuit and Grauman's rent was doubled by the new owner. The structure was able to house a theater only because Grauman had established one there before a fire ordinance prohibiting it was passed. Before his tenancy was over, Grauman hired a crew of men with axes to demolish the interior of the Unique, so it could not be re-built for use as a theater.\nWith the Unique Theater gone and the Lyceum unable to be occupied by the Graumans until 1907, father and son appeared to be temporarily out of business when the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 destroyed both the Unique and Lyceum theaters. Sid was able to save one of the theater's movie projectors from the ruins. He was also able to get a tent from an evangelist preacher in Oakland. Putting those together with some pews from a destroyed church, he set up on the site where the Unique once stood. The Graumans posted a sign outside of their makeshift theater that said: \"Nothing to fall on you but canvas if there is another quake.\" The family received a commendation from the City of San Francisco for their help in boosting citizens' morale during the trying times. They operated their tent theater for two years; by that time David Grauman had opened a theater called the New National Theater. The Graumans expanded their theaters within a short period of time, opening the Imperial and the Empress in San Francisco, and branching out further to other Northern California cities. By 1917, the Graumans decided they would relocate to Los Angeles and build theaters there. They approached Adolph Zukor, who would go on to be the owner and founder of Paramount Pictures, regarding a business deal. Zukor agreed to buy the San Francisco theaters off the Graumans and also to assist them with financing in beginning their theater business in Los Angeles.\n\nSid Grauman introduced the flickers to San Jose, California. On February 7, 1903, Sid Grauman opened the Unique Theatre at 20 East Santa Clara Street in San Jose. The theatre presented movies, stock theater companies, amateur nights, and vaudeville acts. The most notable amateur to develop his talent there was Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle. The 1906 earthquake demolished the Unique Theatre, and Grauman moved on to Los Angeles, founding the Princess Theatre and Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nBy 1918, the first of the three noteworthy Los Angeles movie palaces was open for business: the Million Dollar Theatre. In 1921, David Grauman died suddenly, never able to see the completion of the Egyptian Theatre which opened the year after his death. Now working on his own, Sid Grauman began the building of his last theater, the Chinese Theatre in 1926. It was opened for a premiere on May 18, 1927. There was a crush of onlookers eager to have a glimpse of both the stars attending and the splendor of the building. Many of the fittings were imported from China and Chinese artisans were brought in to create works of sculpture which were originally located in the theater's forecourt and are now housed inside the theater.\n\nThe forecourt still contains the now-famous celebrity hand and footprints in cement. The tradition began by accident, while the finishing touches were being put on the Chinese Theatre. Two versions of the story have been published; one has Mary Pickford as the actress who stepped in the wet cement on her way to see Sid Grauman's new building, and the other credits Norma Talmadge with the misstep. Grauman decided it was a wonderful way to have a permanent record of the stars, and began inviting selected film personalities to put their hand and footprints in concrete. Grauman himself made the choices; the tradition continued after his death using a secret system for choosing celebrities.\n\nGrauman was not the sole owner of the Chinese Theatre, even though it bears his name. His business partners in the venture were Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and Howard Schenck. Two years after its opening, he sold his share of the theater to Fox West Coast Theatres, but remained its Managing Director for the rest of his life. Over four million people visit the Chinese Theatre yearly.\n\nIn addition to his theater, and Hollywood energies, Sid Grauman built the Hollywood Roller Bowl which caused for the 'discovery' of Gloria Nord, who would become one of the most important people in roller skating's history.\n\nGrauman's non-entertainment ventures turned out as badly as his father's. He formed the Black Hills Exploration Corporation in a gold mining effort near Deadwood, South Dakota. Grauman had convinced others such as entertainer Al Jolson and many movie company executives to join him in investing in the company. The company was not successful and Grauman advised everyone to get out of the investment.\n\nGrauman was known far and wide among Hollywood's leading stars and was considered to be a close friend to many, including Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle. It was in Grauman's office at the Million Dollar Theatre that Arbuckle called the San Francisco police to turn himself in. Arbuckle began working for Grauman as a singer at his San Francisco Unique Theater as R. C. Arbuckle. The San Francisco theater connections of father and son meant the Graumans knew people like Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford, as the stars had performed at one of the Grauman theaters when they were on their way up. David Grauman was the originator of Pickford's \"America's Sweetheart\" nickname.\n\nGrauman, who never married, was devoted to his mother. She was the only non-celebrity whose imprints were taken for display; after Rosa's death, Grauman kept all of her personal effects. Grauman was very closely connected with the motion picture industry and appeared in several cameo appearances that nodded to his fame in Hollywood and further afield in the Gold Rush. Living for 35 years at Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel, Grauman spent the last six months of his life at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, but not because of illness. Grauman liked being at Cedars and would leave to eat at various premiere restaurants and return to the hospital to sleep.\n\nGrauman received an honorary Academy Award in 1949 for raising the standard for film exhibition. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6379 Hollywood Blvd. He was one of the original 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS).\n\nGrauman died of a coronary occlusion at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on March 5, 1950, twelve days shy of his 71st birthday. He was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\nAfter Grauman's death, a woman named Carrie Adair came forward with claims of being his common-law wife and the mother of his child. Adair produced a copy of a will and a letter naming her as Grauman's childhood sweetheart. Adair's sister, Agnes Gerlich, gave testimony that her sister was living in Texas during the time she was said to be with Grauman. She also stated that the child Adair referred to was actually her daughter and not Adair's.\n\n\n"}

It lies approximately a mile east of the neighbouring suburb of Parkhead, and just north of Braidfauld and south of Shettleston.\n\nThe area was once host to mass employment in the industrial age thanks largely to the large Fullarton steel works (now occupied by housing). McVitie's biscuit factory is one of the main employers in the area today, with a facility in the area since the 1920s.\n\nMany residents of the Lilybank housing estate would consider themselves residents of Tollcross, but they, like the biscuit factory, were officially placed within the separate Braidfauld Ward of Glasgow City Council until its reorganisation in 2007; since then, Maukinfauld Road has been the local administrative boundary, with land to the west in the Calton ward and land to the east in Shettleston ward along with the rest of Tollcross.\nPart of the Tollcross area was formerly known as Egypt, and is still marked so on a number of maps; the name is believed to have been derived from a farm that existed at one time in the vicinity, operated by a former soldier who had been stationed in Egypt. The farm, owned by the Gordon family in 1920s before being sold to the Hamilton family.\n\nThe poet William Miller, author of \"Wee Willie Winkie\", is buried in Tollcross.\n\nIn June 2011, pupils from St. Aidan's and St. Joan of Arc School combined into a new school located on Fullarton Avenue. They voted to call the new school Cardinal Winning, after Thomas Winning, the late Archbishop of Glasgow who died in 2001; the new school opened on 21 June 2011.\n\nJust south of the school is Fullarton Park, home to the local Junior level football club Vale of Clyde, and the Tollcross Bowling Club adjacent to a modern retail park on London Road.\n\n\"Tollcross House\" was built in 1848 for James Dunlop who was one of the owners of the Clyde Iron Works. David Bryce and William Burn were the architects and the building replaced a substantial house that the original owners of the estate, the Corbets, had occupied. In 1897 the house, now within the centre of the public park, became a Children's Museum and was converted into flats in 1989, then as accommodation for the elderly in 2003.\n\nTollcross Park occupies an area of between Shettleston and Tollcross. It opened in 1897, having been purchased by from the Dunlop family. In 2008, Tollcross was voted the best park in Scotland with its children's farm based around the former main lodge building at its eastern side, the rose garden in the southern section (set out in 1986, which holds annual cultivation trials) playing fields in the north part and a secret garden area.\n\nThe Tollcross conservatories were originally erected in 1870 at Redholm in Ardrossan, North Ayrshire. Baillie A.G. MacDonald of Redholm gifted them to the Glasgow Corporation in 1898 as a gesture to commemorate his inks with the area. They were careful dismantled and re-erected at their present-day site. The Tollcross cast-iron Victorian conservatory (NS 63659 63721), is a B-Listed structure, known as the 'Winter Gardens'. It is Latin-cross shaped in layout, has two semicircular ends and is crowned with a dome. The scrolled cast iron buttresses are a notable feature.\n\nThe conservatory suffered storm damage in December 2010 and January 2011. The conservatory and associated building have been closed since that time. The Winter Gardens are on the 'register of buildings at risk in Scotland'.\n\nThe Winter Gardens underwent a £1.9 million refurbishment between 1998 and 2000 carried out by a partnership of the Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic Environment Scotland and Glasgow City Council. A tent-like extension was built that housed a cafe, toilets, etc. and after being closed for fourteen years the Winter Gardens were opened again in November 2000.\n\nIn 1997, the East End Leisure Centre in Tollcross Park became a feature of the area, featuring an Olympic-sized swimming pool which is used by the City of Glasgow Swim Team. It was renamed as the \"Tollcross International Swimming Centre\" and renovated to serve as the swimming venue of the 2014 Commonwealth Games held in the city.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1796786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796786", "title": "Clan Macrae", "text": "Clan Macrae\n\nThe Clan Macrae is a Highland Scottish clan. The clan has no chief; it is therefore considered an armigerous clan.\n\nThe surname Macrae (and its variations) is an anglicisation of the patronymic from the Gaelic personal name \"MacRaith\". This personal name means \"son of grace\". The name is recorded numerous times in the Middle Ages, and was used by various unrelated families.\n\nAccording to the late 19th-century historian Alexander Mackenzie, and Rev. Alexander Macrae in the early 20th century, the main authority for the early history of Clan Macrae is the late 17th-century manuscript account of the clan written by Rev. John Macrae. Alexander Macrae largely based his history of the clan upon John Macrae's earlier account.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Macraes were originally from Ireland and shared a common ancestry with the Mackenzies and Macleans. The Macraes were said to have originated from Clunes, which is located near the southern shore of the Beauly Firth, and was within the lordship of Lovat. Alexander Macrae stated that these traditions likely refer to a period sometime in the middle of the 13th century. According to John Macrae, after a violent dispute arose between the Macraes and more powerful Frasers of Lovat, three sons of the Macrae chief set off for new lands. One of the sons settled in Brahan, near Dingwall (later the site of Brahan Castle); another settled in Argyll; and the other settled in Kintail.\n\nAt that time Kintail was held by the Mackenzies, and according to John Macrae's account, there were very few Mackenzies of the chiefly line and thus the chief of that clan welcomed the Macraes because they shared a common descent and could be relied upon. Although John Macrae did not know the name of the Macrae brother who settled in Kintail, he stated that this Macrae brother married the daughter, or granddaughter, of Macbeolan who possessed a large part of Kintail before Mackenzie's rise to power. Alexander Mackenzie considered this marriage to be the real reason for the loyalty given by the Macraes to their Mackenzie lords; he did not believe the Macraes and Mackenzies to share a common ancestry in the male line as John Macrae had claimed.\n\nAlexander Macrae was of the opinion that these events probably took place sometime in the first half of the 14th century before the Mackenzies became firmly established in the Kintail area. He stated that there didn't appear to be any evidence that the Macraes were in the Kintail area before the time of these events, but noted that it was said that Eilean Donan Castle was garrisoned by Macraes and Maclennans in the late 13th century, during the period when the fortress was first taken into possession by Kenneth, founder of the Mackenzies of Kintail.\n\nAccording to tradition, one of the prominent ancestors of the Macraes from Kintail was Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd, According to John Macrae, Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd was about two, or three, generations removed from the Macrae who settled in Kintail from Clunes. Alexander Macrae stated that Fionnla Dubh was a contemporary of Murdo Mackenzie, fifth chief of the Mackenzies of Kintail. In 1416, Murdo died and was succeeded by his son, Alexander. According to the traditions of John Macrae, when the bastard uncles of the young Mackenzie chief began oppressing the folk of the district, Fionnla Dubh was instrumental in retrieving him from the south of Scotland; upon Alexander's return, the Mackenzie lands were brought back under control. The main line of the Macraes from Kintail, the Macraes of Inverinate, trace their descent from Fionnla Dubh.\n\nThe Macraes are known to have been constant supporters of the Clan Mackenzie in recorded times; in 1520, and for many years onwards, they were constables of Eilean Donan Castle. In 1539 the Clan Macdonald of Sleat besieged Eilean Donan as part of their attempt to restore the Lordship of the Isles and Duncan Macrae is credited with slaying the Macdonald chief with an arrow which brought the siege to an end. In view of their constant service to the Mackenzies, the Macraes of Kintail became known as the Mackenzies' \"shirt of mail\".\n\nThe Rev. Farquhar Macrae, born in 1580, Constable of Eilean Donan, was both an energetic churchman and a great Latin scholar. On his first visit to the Isle of Lewis, he is said to have baptised all the inhabitants under forty years of age, no clergyman having resided on the island during that period. His second son, John Macrae, became minister of Dingwall in 1640 and died in 1704.\n\nDuring the Civil War the Clan Macrae supported the Royalist cause but under the equivocating Earl of Seaforth firstly fought valiantly on the losing Stateside at the Battle of Auldearn in May 1645 before following Seaforth to support the royalist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose.\n\nRev. Farquhar Macrae's grandson, Duncan Macrae of Inverinate was the compiler of the famous Fernaig manuscript 1688-93.\n\nThe Jacobite rising of 1715 was a disastrous event for the Macraes. The crucial battle was the Battle of Sheriffmuir, near Stirling. The Macraes formed the left flank and were left unprotected when the Jacobite cavalry was moved by error across to the right. The Highland foot (Macraes) was charged by the Government cavalry, fell back and rallied again and again up to twelve times. Of the 232 Jacobite casualties suffered in the battle 58 of those killed were Macraes. Among those killed was Duncan MacRae, who as a young man was known for both his superior strength and his tender heart. During the battle, he killed at least seven men with his Claymore before he was shot down by an English trooper. His claymore was exhibited for many years in the Tower of London as \"The great Highlander's sword\". Another Macrae killed at Sheriffmuir was John of Conchra, who was distinguished in battle and esteemed in the Highlands, he was one of the \"Four Johns of Scotland\".\n\nIn 1721 a force of men from the Clan Ross, led by chief William Ross 6th of the Pitcalnie line and his brother Robert went on a rent-collecting expedition into the lands of the Mackenzies. They were confronted by a force of 300 men from the Clan Mackenzie and Clan Macrae, led by a Colonel Donald Murchison. The Rosses were outnumbered and after a short battle, the two sides parleyed and the Rosses withdrew realising that further resistance was useless. The next day the chief's son Walter Ross died of his wounds and his nephew William, son of Robert Ross, was wounded but survived. \"See main article: Battle of Glen Affric\".\n\nThe Macraes did not support the Jacobite cause in the Jacobite rising of 1745. A number of Macraes are known to have taken the side of the British government as part of the Independent Companies under Captain Colin Mackenzie. It is recorded that the Mackenzie Company was at Shiramore in Badenoch in June 1746 and it included over sixty Macraes. It is recorded that John MacRae was an Ensign in one of the Mackenzie Independent Highland Companies that supported the British Government and that was commanded by the aforementioned Captain Colin Mackenzie.\n\nEilean Donan Castle is located where three lochs meet, Loch Duich, Loch Long and Loch Alsh. It has long been associated with the Macraes, when it was a stronghold of the chiefs of Clan Mackenzie. The castle was destroyed by the British Royal Navy in 1719 during the third of the Jacobite risings. The ruined castle was purchased and rebuilt during 1912–1932, by Lt.-Col. John MacRae-Gilstrap. Its beauty, and spectacular setting, has made it the most photographed castle in Great Britain, and it draws many visitors every year.\n\nToday, crest badges, clan badges, and clan tartans are all means of identifying clans and displaying members' allegiance to their clan. A crest badge suitable to be worn by a member of Clan Macrae, on a bonnet or upon the chest, contains the crest: \"A cubit arm grasping a sword, all proper\". The motto which circles the crest is: \"FORTITUDINE\", which means \"with fortitude\" in Latin.\n\nThe more authentic clan badges (sometimes called plant badges) are actually plants, of which springs are worn upon a bonnet or upon the chest as a badge. The clan badge of Clan Macrae is club moss. sometimes referred to as \"staghorn grass\". It may refer to the Mackenzie chiefly arms, due to the Macraes' close association with the Mackenzies.\n\nThe slogan representing the war cry of the clan \"Sgurr Uaran\" refers to a prominent rallying point in the clan's traditional lands, Sgùrr Fhuaran, a mountain near Loch Duich which is one of the \"Five Sisters of Kintail\".\n\nA 2/4 March for bagpipes was composed in honour of Clan Macrae.\n\n"}

{"id": "1796797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796797", "title": "Alton line", "text": "Alton line\n\nThe Alton line is a railway line in Hampshire and Surrey, England, operated by South Western Railway as a relatively long branch of the South Western Main Line.\n\nThe branch leaves the main line at Pirbright Junction to the west of Brookwood station, Surrey, then turns to the southwest. The route crosses and recrosses the Surrey / Hampshire border, and serves the towns of Aldershot and Farnham before reaching its present-day terminus at Alton in East Hampshire. The line originally continued west to Winchester; the section between Alton and New Alresford is preserved as the heritage Watercress line.\n\nThe Alton line was electrified (750 V DC third rail) during the late interwar years by Southern Railway. Aside from regular electric trains, freight trains operated by EWS and steam trains connected to the Mid Hants Watercress Railway (by way of rolling stock supply or special excursion) operate on the line.\nThe first railway line to Farnham opened in 1849 and was a branch from Guildford via Tongham. The line from Farnham to Alton opened on 28 July 1852. On 2 October 1865 the \"Alton, Aldershot & Winchester Railway\" extended the line from Alton to Winchester, with Alton station moving to a new site. On 2 May 1870 the present-day line from Brookwood to Farnham opened. Alton became a junction station on 1 June 1901 when the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway opened, temporarily closed 1917–1924 as the track was taken up for use in France during the First World War, but reopened after local pressure. Use was light and the line closed in 1933. On 1 June 1903 the \"Meon Valley Railway\" opened from Alton to on the south coast. This line closed to passengers in 1955.\n\nThe section between Alton and Winchester was closed in 1973. The 10 mile stretch from Alton to Alresford was reopened in stages from 1977 to 1985 as the Watercress heritage railway. The route between Alresford and Winchester is unlikely to be reopened, as houses and the M3 motorway have since been built across the route.\n\nThe line closed briefly in August 2006 between Brookwood and Ash Vale due to a landslip at Foxhills Tunnel, causing most commuter journeys to be diverted via Guildford.\nHeavy rainfall destabilised the embankment near Wrecclesham causing closure of the line between 13 April 2016 and 3 May 2016. Network Rail undertook further work to stabilise fully the earthworks.\n\nThere are two trains per hour in each direction between Waterloo and Alton (Mondays to Saturdays). On Sundays, the service is hourly until the early afternoon when half-hourly. Peak time trains take between 67 and 71 minutes for the whole journey; off-peak trains take between 75 and 78 minutes for the journey and Sunday services take 79 to 85 minutes.\n\nPassenger trains that serve this line during off-peak hours also stop at the following stations (from north to south):\n\n\nDuring peak hours trains typically do not stop at Clapham Junction; some peak trains also omit calls at Surbiton, West Byfleet or Brookwood. On Sundays, the service also calls at Wimbledon.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1967, Alton trains ran fast from Waterloo to Surbiton and then ran all stations to Alton. They formed the front (country) end of an 8-car train that split at Woking with the rear 4 cars running to Portsmouth. The trains ran throughout the day and left Waterloo at 27 and 57 minutes past the hour and took exactly 80 minutes to reach Alton. Additionally, there were trains in the rush hours that ran fast to Woking and then all stations – at 16:17, 18:14, and 18:17 (also stopping at Surbiton) to Farnham, and at 16:47, 17:17, 17:47 to Alton taking between 72 and 76 minutes. Trains from Waterloo to Alton from 05:25 to 08:25 left two minutes earlier than the standard departures and called at Wimbledon. All trains took the fast line from Waterloo to Surbiton. The last train in the evening was the 22:57 to Farnham, which ran to Alton on Wednesday and Saturday nights only, arriving at 00:17. On Sundays there was a 23:27 that only ran to Farnham. On weekdays the 17:27 and 19:27 had connections at Bentley to Bordon with a five-minute connection at Bentley and a journey time to Bordon of 15 minutes. The diminutive army town of Bordon had a very regular service on Sunday nights from Bentley.\n\nOn the up line the pattern was similar, with several departures from Farnham to Waterloo starting at 06:05 and then from Alton at 06:54, then every 30 minutes till 22:54 with three extra rush hour services in the morning. In those days the line from Farnham to Alton was double track.\n\nIn the 1980s the pattern was somewhat different: the off-peak trains ran half-hourly and stopped at Surbiton, Woking then all stations, being detached from the Bournemouth (hourly) or Basingstoke (hourly) stopping services. Around 1985 Alton lost its half-hourly service, with half the trains terminating at Farnham. Peak services were approximately every 20 minutes until 1985, half-hourly thereafter, generally going fast Waterloo to Woking, occasionally stopping at West Byfleet or Surbiton\n\nIn 1989 the service changed again with three trains an hour as far as Farnham: a fast train (Clapham Junction, Woking and all stations to Alton), a semi-fast (Surbiton, certain stations to Woking, then all to Farnham) and a slow (Clapham Junction, Wimbledon, Surbiton and all stations to Farnham).\n\nA daily service used to run to Holybourne Oil Terminal from Fawley, but this service has ceased. In order to facilitate the running around of the locomotive on this oil train, the 10:23 service from Waterloo would short at Farnham and not continue to Alton; and as a result there would be no 12:15 return service from Alton to Farnham, this train beginning its journey from Farnham instead at 12:28. This arrangement with the 10:23 Waterloo to Farnham still happens now, even after the suspension of the oil train.\n\nOil carrying wagons are stored in the terminal at Holybourne.\n\nFarnham Traincare Depot (), in Weydon Lane, was opened by the Southern Railway at the time of the electrification of the Portsmouth and Alton lines in 1937. It was refurbished for the introduction of modern units when slam-door trains were replaced circa 2005. At the same time, disused quarry and ballast dump sidings behind the carriage shed were removed and a number of outdoor sidings were laid for overnight storage and servicing of units.\n\nIt is between Farnham railway station, Surrey and Bentley (Hampshire) railway station close to the county border.\n\nSouth Western Railway use the depot under the five-to-ten year government franchise operated by the subsidiary. The depot houses mainly Class 450 trains, but also Class 458 and occasionally Class 444 and 456 trains as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1796801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796801", "title": "John Bentley (football manager)", "text": "John Bentley (football manager)\n\nJohn James Bentley (June 1860 – September 1918) was an English football player and manager, captain, and variously secretary, treasurer and president of Turton F.C., secretary of Bolton Wanderers, the fourth full-time secretary of Manchester United, president of the Football League and vice-president of The Football Association.\n\nTurton F.C. is one of the oldest football clubs in the world; records show that Christ Church F.C. (now Bolton Wanderers) were \"initiated by Turton into the technicalities of the London Association Game\". Turton played many famous sides including Bolton Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers, Everton, Nottingham Forest, Preston North End and Sheffield Wednesday, and many lesser known local teams such as Westhoughton, Astley Bridge and Darwen F.C.. Records show that most of them \"retired well beaten\", until the introduction of professionals \"put the boot on the other leg\". Many of these teams came to Turton for guidance, learning the newly established rules of the game; as such Turton F.C. played a substantial role in the development of the game as we now know it. Records show Turton hosting matches as far back as 1830, though it was not until August 1874 that members voted \"that the Rules of the London Football Association be adopted\".\n\nBentley's first match for Turton F.C. was against Westhoughton in November 1878, at the age of eighteen. Bentley stepped in when Turton were a man down. After \"showing his paces\" he became a regular in the team, proving himself to be an excellent half-back.\n\nFrom 1879 onwards he was sending in match reports to local newspapers. He wrote up the Turton matches under the pen name \"Free Critic\" and, freely critical of his own performances, contributed regular articles to the Bolton Weekly Journal \"Cricket and Football Field\".\n\nBentley was playing for Turton F.C. in September, 1880, when at the invitation of Darwen F.C. the two teams formed the Lancashire County Football Association. Challenges were sent to the Manchester Association, Bolton Wanderers, Cob Wall (Blackburn), Blackburn Rovers, Birch Association, Astley Bridge and Christ Church (Blackburn) Clubs for matches.\n\nA number of Turton players figured in County matches, including John James Bentley, his brother Tom Bentley, H. Brown, W. Forrest, J.J. Greenhalgh, J. Hamer, H. Howarth, James Howarth, W.Mather, T. Scowcroft, C. Tootill, P. Toothill, William Trainor, and J. Waddicor.\n\nBentley was first team captain in 1881 when Sheffield Wednesday came to Turton for an FA Cup match, soon becoming first secretary and then treasurer of Turton F.C.\n\nIn 1882, aged twenty two, he set himself up as an accountant in Acresfield, Bolton. His business thrived, and by 1885 he had given up playing, becoming a collector of income tax and the secretary of Bolton Wanderers. He was described at this time as \"bold but extravagant, a genius who lived in the future, inspired by a vision of what football could become\".\n\nBetween the years 1895 and 1900, John James Bentley was probably the most powerful man English football has ever known.\n\nIn 1886, he left his Bolton accountant's office to work in Manchester as Assistant Editor, and later Editor, of \"The Athletic News\". He became a regular columnist in the Daily Express, Daily Mail and \"Football chat\", a weekly magazine.\n\nIn 1887 William McGregor contacted was John Bentley about the formation of a Football League, because of his influence over Lancashire football. He became a founder committee member of the football league, becoming president on McGregor's retirement in 1894, holding the position until 1910 when he became a life member of the Football League management committee.\n\nAfter leaving Bolton Wanderers, he became the secretary of Manchester United in 1912. Bentley's guidance changed the club from a bankrupt outfit to the power we now know, relocating the team from Clayton to their now world-famous base at Old Trafford. However, he was rather less successful in this role than his predecessor, Ernest Mangnall; he took little interest in the running of the team and largely left the players to their own devices. As a result, the club slumped from being title challengers to barely avoiding relegation, and Bentley handed over to Jack Robson in 1914. He remained involved with Manchester United until retiring from club administration, in 1916, due to ill health.\n\nHe also became vice-president of the FA.\n\nThroughout he maintained contact with Turton FC, and was president of the club in the early years of the 20th Century.\n\nJohn Bentley was born in June 1860 in Chapeltown, a small village to the south of Darwen, between Bolton and Blackburn. His father ran the grocers shop on Chapeltown highstreet, next door to the Chetham arms public house.\n\nHe was very keen on the new Harrow game when it was introduced to Chapeltown. His older brothers Thomas and William joined in with the first games played under the Harrow rules, but John was too young to play until the Association Rules had been introduced.\n\nJohn married and had three children.\n\nJohn James Bentley died aged fifty eight, and was buried in St Anne's Churchyard, Chapeltown, in September 1918.\n\nIn the words of William Pickford, sports writer for the \"Manchester evening Chronicle\":\n\"He could be an autocrat but was rarely unpopular because he drew men towards him like a magnet, once persuaded they were forever loyal\".\n\nIn the words of William McGregor:\n\"In all the years I knew John we never exchanged a wrong word, I was always amazed at his unruffled calm, he made mistakes of course but often because he was too generous, money meant little to him he was a soft touch, especially when it came to former players whose requests he rarely refused, he was a man of real worth blind to the faults of his friends, I can honestly say I have never met a kinder or more easy-going man\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1796806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796806", "title": "Ridgewood, Queens", "text": "Ridgewood, Queens\n\nRidgewood is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. It borders the neighborhoods of Maspeth, Middle Village and Glendale, as well as the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bushwick and East Williamsburg. Historically, the neighborhood straddled the Queens-Brooklyn boundary.\n\nThe etymology of Ridgewood's name is disputed, but may have referred to Ridgewood Reservoir, the local geography, or a road. Ridgewood was settled in the 17th century by the British, while nearby Bushwick was settled by the Dutch. The presence of the adjacent settlements led to decades of disputes over the boundary, which later became the border between Queens and Brooklyn. While Bushwick was developed rapidly in the 19th century, Ridgewood remained sparsely populated until the early 20th century, when rowhouses were built for the area's rapidly growing, predominantly German population. Ridgewood has become more ethnically diverse since the mid-20th century. Today, large parts of the neighborhood are national and city historic districts.\n\nRidgewood is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 104th Precinct. Politically, Ridgewood is represented by the New York City Council's 30th District.\n\nThe origin of the neighborhood's name is disputed. One theory states that it may have come from the Ridgewood Reservoir in Highland Park, located in Brooklyn just south of Ridgewood. The reservoir was located on a high ridge in the middle of the Harbor Hill Moraine, a terminal moraine that runs the length of Long Island. Another possible etymology may have been the forests that covered the area prior to colonial settlement, and the fact that early English settlers referred to the moraine as the \"ridge\" of Long Island. Yet another possible etymology may have been \"Ridge Road\".\n\nThe name of Ridgewood was originally applied by the government of Kings County (which is now coextensive with Brooklyn), and referred to an area within Brooklyn along the border between Kings and Queens Counties. In the early 20th century, developers gave the area various names, including \"Germania Heights, St. James Park, Ridgewood Heights, Wyckoff Heights, [and] Knickerbocker Heights\", though only the name \"Ridgewood\" gained enough popularity past the 1910s.\n\nRidgewood in western Queens is adjacent to Bushwick, Brooklyn, and the two neighborhoods have a similar history. Both were initially settled by the Lenape Native Americans, specifically the Mespachtes tribe (for whom the adjacent neighborhood of Maspeth is named). In 1638, the Dutch West India Company secured a deed from the Lenape; subsequently, Peter Stuyvesant chartered present-day Bushwick in 1661 under the name \"Boswijck\", meaning \"neighborhood in the woods\" in 17th-century Dutch. Likewise, Ridgewood was part of Newtown, one of the three initial towns within Queens, and was settled by the British.\n\nIn both neighborhoods, there were British and Dutch families that tilled farms and grew crops for Brooklyn's and Manhattan's markets. Many of these farms also contained slaves. The only remaining Dutch farmhouse that is known to survive in the neighborhood is the Onderdonk House, which was erected in 1709. Also located at the Onderdonk House site is Arbitration Rock, which was a marker for the disputed boundary between Bushwick and Newtown, and by extension Brooklyn and Queens (see ). The land remained rural through the American Revolutionary War, though there was possibly a burial ground in the area. Ridgewood's oldest streets are Myrtle Avenue, Metropolitan Avenue, and Fresh Pond Road, which were subsequently used by farmers to take their goods to the markets. Fresh Pond Road was formerly a Native American trail, while the other roads were laid out as plank roads in the early to mid-19th century.\n\nThe development of public transportation, starting with horse-drawn cars in the mid-19th century and later succeeded by trolleys and elevated trains, helped to spur residential and retail development. The first transit line to arrive in the neighborhood was the Myrtle Avenue horsecar, which was extended to Brooklyn's Broadway in 1855. Following this, the Bay Ridge Branch opened in 1878, connecting to Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan Beach, and the Brooklyn shorefront via the Manhattan Beach Railroad. The Myrtle Avenue elevated railroad, running above Myrtle Avenue within Brooklyn, was extended to the Queens border in 1889. An electric trolley line through Ridgewood, running to Lutheran Cemetery, was opened along a private right-of-way in 1894. Ten years later, the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was extended on a ground level alignment over that trolley line. The current elevated structure would be erected along the Lutheran Cemetery line's right-of-way in 1915.\n\nSimultaneously, northern Brooklyn was seeing an increase in the number of German immigrants. Many of the city's German immigrants had originally settled in Manhattan's Little Germany, located mostly within the East Village and Lower East Side, in the mid-19th century. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German immigrants had moved to other enclaves such as Yorkville, Manhattan; Steinway, Queens; and the north Brooklyn/Ridgewood area. The discovery of freshwater under northern Brooklyn resulted in the development of breweries, where many Germans worked. By 1880, there were 35 breweries in Brooklyn, including a 14-block \"brewer's row\" within Bushwick that contained at least 11 breweries. Factories and knitting mills were also opened within the communities, and speculative German developers built houses, consisting mostly of multi-family stock that were three or four stories tall. \"Brewer's Row\" had grown to 14 breweries by 1890.\n\nRidgewood remained rural until the unification of New York City's boroughs in 1898, even as Bushwick had become fully developed. Development in Ridgewood in the 19th century consisted mostly of picnicking locations, beer gardens, racetracks, and amusement areas for the residents of Bushwick. By the end of the century, developers had bought these sites and started constructing rowhouses and tenements, usually two to three stories high. The Ridgewood Board of Trade, created in 1902, was organized to develop the streets and utilities, and to improve the transit infrastructure.\n\nMuch of the housing stock was erected between 1905 and 1915. Most of the houses built before 1905 were wood-frame houses; that year, a zoning ordinance was passed, requiring new buildings to be made of masonry. The area was developed more quickly after the Queensboro Bridge opened in 1909, connecting Queens to Manhattan. According to a 1909 issue of the \"Real Estate Record and Guide\", development was concentrated in an 150-block area around East Williamsburg in Brooklyn, namely the present-day area of Ridgewood. More than five thousand buildings were built from the beginning of the 20th century to World War I's start in the mid-1910s. Residential construction predominated in the southern part of Ridgewood while industrial factories and mills were prevalent in the northern section, near Newtown Creek.\n\nConstruction slowed down during World War I, but resumed shortly after the war's end, and by the 1930s the last farmland in Ridgewood had been developed. Some of the later houses were single-family homes with garages. Two of the more drastic changes to Ridgewood's character in the 1920s were the implementation of a street numbering system across Queens in 1925, followed by the opening of the Canarsie subway on the neighborhood's southern border in 1928.\n\nRidgewood was among New York City's most quickly-developing neighborhoods between at least 1906 and 1911. Much of the new housing was originally settled by Germans, who had mostly moved from other neighborhoods such as Williamsburg. To the German newcomers, the modern and more expansive houses in Ridgewood provided an improvement over the cramped housing stock in their former neighborhoods. A 1913 \"Real Estate Record\" article stated that, for several years, Germans had been moving from Ridgewood from the city's other boroughs. Figures from the 1910 United States Census indicated that much of Ridgewood's population was working-class and of German or Eastern European descent, and many homes were owner-occupied. Ridgewood's German population was so large that the \"Ridgewood Times\" first issue in 1908 was published in both English and German.\n\nAfter World War I, the population expanded with an influx of Gottscheers, an ethnic German population from Slovenia who were dislocated in the aftermath of World War I, and spoke the Gottscheerish dialect. Other Eastern Europeans came as well. As recorded in the 1920 United States Census, the population of Ridgewood was mostly working-class homeowners from Germany, Austria, or Italy, with a smaller population from Hungary, Ireland, Poland, and Sweden. The demographic figures remained relatively unchanged through the 1930 United States Census. The large German presence led to disputes following the rise of Nazi Germany, and a large, 9,000-person boycott of Nazi Germany in April 1934 resulted in brawls between Nazi sympathizers and Jewish Communist groups. Still, in the 1939 WPA Guide to New York City, workers for the Federal Writers' Project described Ridgewood and Bushwick as \"old-fashioned and respectable\", and said that Ridgewood \"rivals Manhattan's Yorkville as a German center.\"\n\nBy the 1940 United States Census, Southern Europeans were also recorded as having moved into Ridgewood. In the mid-20th century, Romanians, Serbs, and Puerto Ricans arrived. By the late 20th century, Poles, Dominicans, and Ecuadorians—including a significant population of Quechua-speaking Amerindians from the Imbabura and Cañar provinces of Ecuador—had moved to Ridgewood. Other large populations included Yugoslavians, Chinese, Koreans, and Slovenians. \n\nOriginally, Ridgewood and Glendale shared ZIP Code 11227 with Bushwick. Following the 1977 blackout, the communities of Ridgewood and Glendale expressed a desire to disassociate themselves from Bushwick. Residents voted on a proposal to create a new ZIP Code, and a majority of votes were cast in favor of the proposal. The communities were given the ZIP Code 11385 in 1980. \n\nBy the mid-1980s, parts of Ridgewood had been given federal landmark designations. Young professionals were also moving to the neighborhood in large numbers, and Ridgewood's homeownership rates increased.\n\nBased on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Ridgewood was 69,317, a decrease of 138 (0.2%) from the 69,455 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .\n\nThe racial makeup of the neighborhood was 39.8% (27,558) White, 2.0% (1,380) African American, 0.1% (93) Native American, 7.7% (5,331) Asian, 0.0% (19) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (204) from other races, and 1.1% (765) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 49.0% (33,967) of the population. The entirety of Community Board 5, which comprises Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale, had 166,924 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.4 years. This is about equal to the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 22% are between the ages of 0–17, 31% between 25–44, and 26% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 8% and 13% respectively.\n\nAs of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 5 was $71,234. In 2018, an estimated 19% of Ridgewood and Maspeth residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in seventeen residents (6%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 46% in Ridgewood and Maspeth, lower than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.\n\nRidgewood is zoned for various land uses, but is mostly commercial along main streets and residential along side streets. Large parts of the neighborhood are residential historic districts. In addition, the large Cemetery Belt is located directly to the south.\n\nThe majority of the neighborhood covers a large hill, part of the glacial moraine that created Long Island, which starts at Metropolitan Avenue, rises steeply for about two blocks, then slopes down gently. For instance, at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Parish on 60th Place, the front entrance of the church is almost level with the second floor of the Parish school next door. Part of Ridgewood around the Linden Hill Cemetery, centered around Flushing and Metropolitan Avenues, was once known as Linden Hill, distinct from the neighborhood of Linden Hill in Flushing, Queens. Linden Street is named after this subsection of Ridgewood.\n\nRidgewood is a densely settled neighborhood, with housing stock ranging from six-family buildings near the Brooklyn border to two-family and single-family row houses deeper into Queens. Ridgewood is visually distinguished by the large amount of exposed brick construction, which is characteristic of the early-20th-century rowhouses built in the neighborhoods.\n\nMost of Ridgewood was developed block-by-block around the turn of the 20th century. Most of the buildings were designed by local architect Louis Berger & Co., which designed more than 5,000 buildings in the area. The neighborhood has been largely untouched by construction since then, leaving many centrally planned blocks of houses and tenements still in the same state as their construction. These blocks include the Mathews Flats (six-family cold water tenements), Ring-Gibson Houses (two- and four-family houses with stores), and Stier Houses (curved two-family rowhouses). Many of these houses are well-kept and retain much of their early 20th century appeal.\n\nThere are low-density commercial districts along Myrtle, Forest, and Metropolitan Avenues and Fresh Pond Road.\n\nRidgewood is home to Ridgewood Savings Bank, the largest mutual savings bank in New York State. Their headquarters is located at the intersection of Myrtle and Forest Avenues and was built in 1929. The building architects were Halsey, McCormack and Helmer, Inc. and the general contractors were Stamarith Construction Corporation. The building's exterior is made of limestone and contains an eight-foot granite base. The interior has travertine walls and marble floors.\n\nIn Ridgewood 10 national historic districts were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\n\nIn addition, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has designated four landmark districts in Ridgewood:\n\n\nThere are two individual city-designated landmarks:\n\nThe Vander Ende-Onderdonk House, the Evergreens Cemetery, and St. Matthias Roman Catholic Church Complex are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nMaspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale are patrolled by the 104th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 64-02 Catalpa Avenue. The 104th Precinct ranked 21st safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. However, the precinct covers a large diamond-shaped area, and Maspeth and Middle Village are generally seen as safer than Ridgewood. With a non-fatal assault rate of 19 per 100,000 people, Ridgewood and Maspeth's rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 235 per 100,000 people is lower than that of the city as a whole.\n\nThe 104th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 87.4% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 2 murders, 17 rapes, 140 robberies, 168 felony assaults, 214 burglaries, 531 grand larcenies, and 123 grand larcenies auto in 2018.\n\nRidgewood contains a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire station, Engine Co. 291/Ladder Co. 140, at 56-07 Metropolitan Avenue.\n\nPreterm and teenage births are less common in Ridgewood and Maspeth than in other places citywide. In Ridgewood and Maspeth, there were 70 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 17.6 teenage births per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide). Ridgewood and Maspeth have a low population of residents who are uninsured. In 2018, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 13%, slightly higher than the citywide rate of 12%.\n\nThe concentration of fine particulate matter, the deadliest type of air pollutant, in Ridgewood and Maspeth is , more than the city average. Twenty percent of Ridgewood and Maspeth residents are smokers, which is higher than the city average of 14% of residents being smokers. In Ridgewood and Maspeth, 19% of residents are obese, 7% are diabetic, and 20% have high blood pressure—compared to the citywide averages of 22%, 8%, and 23% respectively. In addition, 19% of children are obese, compared to the citywide average of 20%.\n\nNinety-two percent of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is higher than the city's average of 87%. In 2018, 78% of residents described their health as \"good,\" \"very good,\" or \"excellent,\" equal to the city's average of 78%. For every supermarket in Ridgewood and Maspeth, there are 5 bodegas.\n\nThe nearest major hospitals are Elmhurst Hospital Center in Elmhurst and the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Bushwick.\n\nRidgewood is covered by ZIP Code 11385, which it shares with neighboring Glendale. The United States Post Office operates three post offices nearby:\n\nToday, Ridgewood's land area lies within Queens County. However, its political boundary with Brooklyn causes confusion and debate about where the western boundary of Ridgewood truly lies and whether part of Ridgewood is considered to be actually part of Brooklyn. The political dispute dates to the 17th century, when Newtown was under English rule and Boswijck was under Dutch rule. Disputes over the boundary between the two settlements continued until 1769, when a boundary line was drawn through what later became known as the Arbitration Rock. The street grid plan in Ridgewood and Bushwick was laid out in the late 19th century. Because the Arbitration Rock lay along a diagonal with this grid plan, numerous houses were built on the Brooklyn-Queens boundary, their owners sometimes subject to taxes from both counties. During the 19th century, this resulted in situations where some houses received water and fire protection from what was then the city of Brooklyn, while their neighbors in Queens had to rely on volunteer firefighting squads and paid exorbitant water bills to private utilities in Elmhurst.\n\nIn 1925, the political boundary was adapted to the street grid, resulting in a zig-zag pattern. The change resulted in 2,543 persons' addresses being reassigned from Queens to Brooklyn, and 135 persons' addresses reassigned from Brooklyn to Queens. Modern addresses in the two boroughs can be distinguished by the presence or absence of a hyphen in the house number. Queens's house numbering system uses a hyphen between the closest cross-street (which comes before the hyphen) and the actual address (which comes after the hyphen). While buildings fronting on streets that are west of Forest Avenue and the Bay Ridge Branch follow the Queens address numbering system, the avenues which run parallel to the county line—bounded by Metropolitan Avenue to the north, Forest Avenue to the east, and the Brooklyn border to the south—do not follow this address numbering system. Streets in this area that run perpendicular to the county line are demarcated by a jump in numbering sequence between the two boroughs.\n\nSince at least 1898, when the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens were created as part of the City of Greater New York, Glendale and Ridgewood's postal mail had been routed through the main Brooklyn post office in Williamsburg, rather than the main post office in Flushing, because they are located closer to Williamsburg. When ZIP Codes were assigned in 1963, the neighborhoods were assigned Brooklyn ZIP Codes with the 112 prefix, along with all areas whose mail was routed through a Brooklyn post office. This gave Glendale and Ridgewood a Brooklyn mailing address despite actually being located in Queens. The neighborhoods' ZIP Code of 11227 was shared with Bushwick, Brooklyn, as well as with Wyckoff Heights on the border of the two boroughs. After the 1977 New York City blackout, newspapers around the country published UPI and \"Associated Press\" photos of Bushwick residents with stolen items and a police officer beating a suspected looter, and Bushwick became known for riots and looting. Afterward, the communities of Ridgewood and Glendale expressed a desire to disassociate themselves from Bushwick.\n\nFollowing complaints from residents, Postmaster General William Bolger proposed that the ZIP Codes would be changed if United States Representative Geraldine Ferraro could produce evidence that 70% of residents supported it. After Ferraro's office distributed ballots to residents, 93 percent of the returned ballots voted for the change. The change to ZIP Code 11385 was made effective January 13, 1980.\n\nThe \"Ridgewood Times\", established in 1908 and now known as the \"Times Newsweekly\", serves as the community newspaper. It is published in English and was formerly published in German as well.\n\nRidgewood and Maspeth generally have a lower rate of college-educated residents than the rest of the city. While 33% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, 16% have less than a high school education and 50% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 39% of Queens residents and 43% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Ridgewood and Maspeth students excelling in math rose from 36% in 2000 to 67% in 2011, and reading achievement rose from 42% to 49% during the same time period.\n\nRidgewood and Maspeth's rate of elementary school student absenteeism is less than the rest of New York City. In Ridgewood and Maspeth, 14% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, lower than the citywide average of 20%. Additionally, 82% of high school students in Ridgewood and Maspeth graduate on time, more than the citywide average of 75%.\n\nRidgewood's public schools are operated by the New York City Department of Education. Ridgewood contains the following public elementary schools, which serve grades PK-5 unless otherwise indicated:\n\n\nThe following middle schools are located in Ridgewood:\n\n\nGrover Cleveland High School is the only high school in Ridgewood, and is the zoned public high school to most of Ridgewood.\n\nThere are two Catholic grammar schools located in the neighborhood. The first one is the Notre Dame Catholic Academy (formerly known as Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal School) located on Bleecker and 61st Streets. The second one is St. Matthias Catholic Academy located on Catalpa Avenue between Onderdonk and Woodward Avenues.\n\nThe Queens Public Library's Ridgewood branch is located at 20-12 Madison Street.\n\nThe Brooklyn Public Library's Washington Irving branch is located at 360 Irving Avenue near Woodbine Street, just across Ridgewood's border with Bushwick. The Queens and Brooklyn Public Libraries are separate library systems and are not interchangeable.\n\nThe New York City Subway's BMT Myrtle Avenue Line () runs through the heart of Ridgewood with stops at , , and . Additionally, the Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues station, in the southern portion of Ridgewood, is a transportation hub serving the Myrtle Avenue Line, the BMT Canarsie Line (), and several buses. At the end of the Myrtle Avenue Line is the Fresh Pond Yard, a storage yard for the . Halsey Street () has entrances in both Ridgewood and Bushwick.\n\nThe Ridgewood Terminal at the Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues station serves New York City Bus' lines. The bus lines also serve Ridgewood. In addition, the neighborhood is home to the large Fresh Pond Bus Depot, which services many of the buses that run throughout Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nThe Ridgewood Park baseball ground, built on land owned by William Wallace, was part of a larger entertainment area bounded by Wyckoff Avenue, Covert Street, Halsey Street, and Irving Avenue. From 1886 to 1889, it was home to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms (later the Brooklyn Dodgers and now the Los Angeles Dodgers) for their Sunday games. The property continued to operate until 1959. Another similarly named site, called Grauer's Ridgewood Park, was located between Myrtle Avenue, Cypress Avenue, Seneca Avenue, and Decatur Street, and was used mainly as a picnic site.\n\nMafera Park, named after former Queens borough president Joseph F. Mafera, is located south of the Fresh Pond Junction, between the Myrtle Avenue elevated line to the west and the Bay Ridge Branch to the east.\n\nNotable current and former residents of Ridgewood include:\n\n\n"}

(; ) is the national stock exchange of the Philippines. The exchange was created in 1992 from the merger of the Manila Stock Exchange and the Makati Stock Exchange. Including previous forms, the exchange has been in operation since 1927.\n\nThe main index for PSE is the PSE Composite Index (PSEi) composed of thirty (30) listed companies. The selection of companies in the PSEi is based on a specific set of criteria. There are also six additional sector-based indices. The PSE is overseen by a 15-member Board of Directors, chaired by José T. Pardo.\n\nOn February 3, 1936, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had \"relinquished control of the Manila Stock Exchange.\"\n\nThe Philippine Stock Exchange was formed on December 23, 1992 from the merger of the Manila Stock Exchange (MSE) (established on August 12, 1927, based on Muelle de la Industria, Binondo, Manila) and the Makati Stock Exchange (MkSE) (established on May 15, 1963, based in the Makati Central Business District, within Ayala Tower One). Both exchanges traded the same stocks of the same companies.\n\nIn June 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted the PSE a \"Self-Regulatory Organization\" (SRO) status, which meant that the bourse can implement its own rules and establish penalties on erring trading participants (TPs) and listed companies.\n\nIn 2001, the PSE was transformed from a non-profit, non-stock, member-governed organization into a shareholder-based, revenue-earning corporation headed by a president and a board of directors and on December 15, 2003 listed its own shares on the exchange (traded under the ticker symbol PSE).\n\nOn January 4, 1993, the former Manila Stock Exchange started the computerization of its operations using the Stratus Trading System (STS) with a company called Equicom. On June 15, the former Makati Stock Exchange adopted the MakTrade trading system. Both systems were linked on March 25, 1994 to produce a One Price-One Market exchange. Two years later, on November 13, 1995, the implementation of the Unified Trading System (UTS) allowed the use of a single-order-book system on a MakTrade software where all the orders are posted and matched in one computer.\n\nIn October 2004, the Securities Clearing Corporation of the Philippines (SCCP), a clearing and settlement agency for depository eligible trades, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the PSE. The SCCP acts as the settlement coordinator and risk manager for broker transactions as well as administrator of the trade guaranty fund.\n\nIn 2005, the PSE adopted an online daily disclosure system (ODiSy) to improve the transparency of listed companies and ensure full, fair, timely and accurate disclosure of material information from all listed companies. The ODiSy provides a 24/7 online system access for the submission of all types of disclosures.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, the PSE launched its new trading system, PSEtrade, which replaced the MakTrade system.

He was the third African-American mayor in the city's history.\n\nOn September 8, 1960 Bill Campbell was enrolled in Murphey Elementary School in Raleigh, North Carolina at the age of seven, thus becoming the first black student to attend an all-white school in Raleigh City Schools. He later recalled, \"My family prepared me by simply saying this. 'This is important, and you’re going to have to do it. You’re going to have to endure it'.\" Campbell's parents also tried to enroll Campbell's older brother, Ralph, and his older sister but he was the only one approved for entry. Campbell was accepted by his teacher and immediate classmates, but his presence upset some of the parents of other students. Some of the older students bullied him, and his parents received bomb threats. Campbell remained the only black student at Murphey for five years. He later graduated from William G. Enloe High School.\n\nCampbell received a B.A. from Vanderbilt University, and a J.D. from Duke University Law School. He was a member of Omega Psi Phi.\n\nCampbell was heartily endorsed by outgoing mayor Maynard Jackson, and won the 1993 election. During his first term, his major accomplishments included overhauling the city's finance department, passing a major bond issue to pay for infrastructure improvements for the 1996 Olympics, rebuilding the public housing system, and modernizing the legal, public works, and water departments. Violent crime rates also dropped significantly during his tenure. According to Douglas A. Blackmon, Campbell was seen as a \"post–civil rights movement black politician who would leverage the economic rebirth of Atlanta, build a bridge to white voters, and become a U.S. senator or a Georgia governor\".\n\nCampbell subsequently fell into disfavour during his second term, despite defeating then-president of the Atlanta City Council, Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.. The 1997 race was known for its emphasis on the racial overtones often not publicly seen in the African-American community, with Campbell being the lighter-skinned candidate and Arrington the darker complexioned. Campbell would later be criticized for deploying anti-Black racist messaging in an attempt to deflect criticism of his record as mayor. Campbell was succeeded by Shirley Franklin. Following his tenure as mayor, he moved to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, where he worked as a practicing attorney. He was disbarred by order of the Supreme Court of Florida as a result of his tax evasion conviction.\n\nIn November 1994, the Atlanta Empowerment Zone was established, a 10-year, $250 million federal program to revitalise Atlanta's 34 poorest neighbourhoods including the Bluff. Scathing reports from both the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs revealed corruption, waste, bureaucratic incompetence, and specifically called out interference by mayor Campbell.\n\nAccording to the documentary, \"\", Mayor Campbell accepted a $6,900 campaign contribution and a trip to Paris from water privatization company Suez even though he was \"not running for office.\"\n\nIn August 2004 Campbell retained high-profile attorney Billy Martin to defend him against several indictments by a federal grand jury on racketeering, bribery, and wire fraud. The charges came from a five-year federal investigation into possible corruption during his time as Mayor of Atlanta. Campbell was later acquitted on all charges relating to the indictments; although on March 10, 2006, a federal jury convicted him on three counts of tax evasion. He was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Story to 30 months in prison for the three counts on tax evasion. He was also ordered to serve a year on probation, pay $6,000, and pay more than $60,000 in back taxes. On August 21, 2006 he reported to the Federal Correctional Institution in Miami, Florida.\n\nCampbell was released from prison in December 2007 after receiving a shortened sentence by enrolling in a drug treatment program. This came just a short time after he told a federal judge that he was not struggling with a drug abuse problem. It was reported that the New York Times that “Prison officials said inmates must offer documentation of prior substance abuse to enter the treatment program, but for privacy reasons they said they could not disclose whether Mr.Campbell submitted such proof.” Mr. Campbell statements to the judge wasn't used to determine whether or not he could enter the program.\n\nAfter leaving prison he lived in a halfway house until October 21, 2008.\n\n"}

Strategies of the Swadeshi movement involved boycotting British products and the revival of domestic products and production processes B.C Bhole identifies five phases of the Swadeshi movement.\n\n\nThe Swadeshi movement started with the partition of Bengal by the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon in 1905 and continued up to 1911.\nIt was the most successful of the pre-Gandhian movement. Its chief architects were Aurobindo Ghosh, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai, Babu Genu. Swadeshi, as a strategy, was a key focus of Mahatma Gandhi, who described it as the soul of Swaraj (self rule). It was strongest in Bengal and was also called the Vandemataram movement.\n\nThe word \"Swadeshi\" derives from Sanskrit and is a \"sandhi\" or conjunction of two Sanskrit words. \"Swa\" means \"self\" or \"own\" and \"desh\" means country, so \"Swadesh\" would be \"own country\", and \"Swadeshi\", the adjectival form, would mean \"of one's own country\".\n\nCredit to starting the Swadeshi movement goes to Baba Ram Singh Kuka of the Sikh Namdhari sect, whose revolutionary movements which heightened around 1871 and 1872.\nNaamdharis were instructed by Baba Ram Singh to only wear clothes made in the country and boycott foreign goods. The Namdharis resolved conflict in the peoples court and totally avoided British law and British courts. They also boycotted the educational system as Baba Ram Singh prohibited children from attending British School, amongst other forms and measures he employed.\n\nThe Post-Independence \"Swadeshi Movement\" has developed forth differently than its pre-independence counterpart. While the pre-independence movement was essentially a response to colonial policies, the post-independence Swadeshi movement sprung forth as an answer to increasingly oppressive imperialistic policies in the post-Second World War climate. For a nation emerging from two centuries of colonial oppression, India was required to compete with the industrialised economies of the west. While rapid industrialisation under the umbrella of \"Five year Plans\" were aimed at enabling a self-sufficient India, the need to balance it with a predominantly agrarian set-up was the need of the hour. This need to preserve the old fabric of an agrarian country while simultaneously modernising, necessitated a resurgence of a slightly recast \"Swadeshi Movement\". Forerunners of this resurgent movement was noted journalist, writer and critic S. R. Ramaswamy. Others of late in the movement include the likes of Rajiv Dixit, Swami Ramdev and Pawan Pandit.

{"id": "1796865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796865", "title": "Sunnyside, Queens", "text": "Sunnyside, Queens\n\nSunnyside is a neighborhood in the western portion of the New York City borough of Queens. It shares borders with Hunters Point and Long Island City to the west, Astoria to the north, Woodside to the east and Maspeth to the south. It contains the Sunnyside Gardens Historic District, one of the first planned communities in the United States.\n\nThe name \"Sunnyside\" originates with the Bragaw family, French Huguenots who had purchased the land in 1713 and named their estate \"Sunnyside Hill\". Sunnyside was a rural hamlet mostly consisting of small farms and marshland. It was incorporated into Long Island City in 1870, and developed into a bedroom community after the Queensboro Bridge was completed in 1909. A large portion of the neighborhood is six-story apartment buildings constructed during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nSunnyside is located in Queens Community District 2 and its ZIP Codes are 11101, 11104, and 11377. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 108th Precinct. Politically, Sunnyside is represented by the New York City Council's 26th District.\n\nSunnyside Gardens, listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places, is among the first planned communities in the U.S.\n\nSunnyside Gardens includes one-, two-, and three-family homes, and a few apartment buildings, all made of Hudson brick (it was inexpensive, durable, and available). Each private residence has a small front garden facing the street and a private garden in the rear. The rental units in the two- and three-family houses enjoy private terraces overlooking the gardens. There are two configurations: the courtyard condition and the mews condition; at the edges of the community some homes simply line the street, with a common walkway running the length of the row. Homes in the courtyard blocks enclose an inner courtyard that was designated a common, landscaped but not used for recreation. Each homeowner actually owned, and paid taxes on, the part of the common in the block and lot, even if it was not used. The mews houses face a common front court and back on alleys; each mews house also has a private rear yard.\n\nThis model allowed for denser residential development, while also providing ample open/green-space amenities. Clarence Stein and Henry Wright served as the primary architects and planners for this development (Frederick L. Ackerman designed some of the mews houses), and the landscape architect was Marjorie Sewell Cautley. As an amenity for the residents, the City Housing Corporation reserved lots on the northern edge of the development (abutting the Sunnyside Yard) for one of only two private parks in the city, the other being Gramercy Park.\n\nThe area was the first development in the United States patterned after the ideas of the garden city movement initiated in England in the first decades of the twentieth century by Ebenezer Howard and Raymond Unwin, specifically Hampstead Garden Suburb and Letchworth Garden City. Covering 77 acres between Queens Boulevard and the Sunnyside Railroad Yards, Sunnyside Gardens was constructed between 1924 and 1928 by the City Housing Corporation, founded by developer Alexander Bing, and architects Clarence Stein and Henry Wright. The project grew out of discussions in the early 1920s about housing and planning; social critic Lewis Mumford and economist Richard T. Ely were leading participants.\n\nIn the early years of the Great Depression, nearly 60 percent of the residents lost their homes to foreclosure. Those difficult years saw organized resistance by residents who forcefully resisted efforts by city marshals to evict families. The character of Sunnyside Gardens was protected by 40-year easements which protected the integrity of the courtyards and common walkways and controlled changes to the exterior of every property, extending to even paint color. Those covenants lapsed in the mid-1960s, and some homeowners rushed to claim their property, erecting fences into the middle of some courtyards. In response, in 1974 the Department of City Planning designated Sunnyside Gardens a special planned community preservation district, together with Fresh Meadows, Parkchester, and the Harlem River Houses. With that designation came rules protecting the inner courts and landscaping, and prohibiting driveways and curbcuts, rear sheds, and additions.\n\nThe Sunnyside Gardens Historic District is a national historic district that includes 66 contributing buildings and 12 contributing sites. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and as a city historic district in 2007.\n\nSunnyside Gardens is a park that takes up approximately three and a half acres, also known as a New York City landmark. It was built between 1924 and 1928, roughly taking up 16 blocks, which consists more than 600 buildings. It has 12 courts within the landmark, which are known as Carolin Gardens, Colonial Court, Hamilton Court, Hamilton Court Apartments, Harrison Place, Jefferson Court, Lincoln Court, Madison Court North and South, Monroe Court Apartments, Phipps Garden Apartments I, Phipps Garden Apartments II, Roosevelt Court, Washington Court, and the Wilson Court. Sunnyside Gardens is located in the Northwestern part of Queens which was established by Clarence Stein, Henry Wright and the City Housing Corporation were led by Alexander Bing. The creators of the Sunnyside Gardens wanted to create housing which would be inexpensive to residents to stop the shortages and overcrowding of other areas.\n\nIn 2003, a grassroots movement started to request designation as a New York City Historic District, in response to lack of protection for the historic character of the homes in the neighborhood. The campaign was contentious and garnered publicity in major news outlets, including WNYC and the New York Times. On April 17, 2007, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (NYCLPC) held a public hearing on the neighborhood, which was controversial, with 60 people speaking in favor and 25 against the designation. This was documented on New York Public Radio in a segment called \"Cloud Over Sunnyside?\". On June 26, 2007, the NYCLPC voted to designate the community. The designation prevents most major work from being done without consultation with the NYCLPC.\n\nBased on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Sunnyside was 63,271, a change of 1,324 (2.1%) from the 61,947 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .\n\nThe racial makeup of the neighborhood was 35.4% (22,424) White, 2.5% (1,588) African American, 0.2% (109) Native American, 24.3% (15,390) Asian, 0%(29) Pacific Islander, 0.6% (395) from other races, and 2.1% (1,342) from two or more races.

High priests are typically more experienced leaders within the priesthood. The term derives in part from the Epistle to the Hebrews, which describes Jesus as \"a high priest after the order of Melchizedek\" (5:10; see also 6:20). Movement founder Joseph Smith ordained the first high priests on June 3, 1831.\n\nHigh priests are organized into quorums. The first president of a high priests quorum of the church was Smith's younger brother, Don Carlos Smith.\n\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), high priests are primarily responsible for the spiritual welfare of the members and the administration of local church units called wards and stakes.\n\nMelchizedek priesthood holders in the church are ordained high priests when they become a member of a stake presidency, stake high council, or bishopric, \"or when otherwise determined by the stake president\". Ordinations are approved by the member's bishop and stake president and the common consent of the general priesthood membership in the stake. A man must hold the Melchizedek priesthood and hold the priesthood office of elder before he may become a high priest. Ordination is done by another high priest by the laying on of hands.\n\nLike other priesthood offices in the LDS Church, high priests are organized into quorums. The high priests quorum is organized at the stake level, with the president of the quorum being the stake president. (In contrast, priesthood quorums for the offices of deacon, teacher, priest, and elder are organized at the ward level.) Prior to the church's April 2018 General Conference, the stake president would organize a high priest \"group\" in each ward. Each group was provided with a group leader, who typically selected two assistants and a secretary to assist him. However, following changes announced in general conference, the high priest group were to disband at the ward level. The high priest quorum on the stake level henceforth would consist of high priests currently serving in the stake presidency, as a high councilor, in a bishopric, or as a functioning patriarch. High priests not currently serving in those callings would join their ward's elders quorum.\n\nIn a district, there is no high priests quorum. Men holding the office of high priest join the elders quorum of the branch they live in.\n\nThere are a number of positions in the LDS Church which may only be filled by a high priest. Among these are the stake president and his counselors, members of a stake high council, mission president, and member of a temple presidency. A bishop must be a high priest [unless he has a right-by-lineage to the calling (see D&C 107:69)]. Bishop's counselors are usually high priests, but there are some exceptions. (For example, the church does not require counselors in some young single adult wards to be ordained high priests.) Any high priest may become a member of the First Presidency, but in recent practice most members of the First Presidency have been apostles.\n\nSince 1995, individuals ordained to the office of seventy are ordained first to the office of high priest.\n\n\n"}

No further explanation for the suspension was ever given. By the next match, two days later against Bolton Wanderers, Lal Hilditch had taken over on a temporary basis as player-manager.\n\nFollowing the end of his suspension, Chapman unsuccessfully applied to become manager of Leeds United and turned down two football management offers before taking up a position as the general manager of the Liverpool Greyhound Racing Club in August 1927.\n"}

Established by six friends in June 1993, the company is best known for the first-person shooter series \"Serious Sam\" as well as the 2014 puzzle game \"The Talos Principle\".\n\nCroteam was established on 14 June 1993, as a \"garage games\" company in Zagreb, Croatia, headed up by six friends. The company's founders were Admir Elezović, Davor Hunski, Alen Ladavac, Roman Ribarić, Dean Sekulić, and Davor Tomičić. Their first video game was \"Football Glory\", a football game which was published by Black Legend for the Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200 platforms in 1994, and then for PC in 1995. Sensible Software threatened legal action against Croteam, asserting that \"Football Glory\" was a clone of their video game \"Sensible Soccer\". Croteam ceased further development on the title and released it as freeware in 1998. Their second video game, titled \"Save the Earth\", was a children's game based on a Croatian TV series and released for the Amiga 4000. One year later, Croteam finished \"Five-A-Side Soccer\", an indoor soccer version of \"Football Glory\" for the Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200.\n\nA long hiatus followed, broken by the first title of the \"Serious Sam\" series, \"\" in 2001, followed by \"\" in 2002. Both \"Serious Sam\" games debuted on Microsoft Windows and utilised Croteam's in-house Serious Engine. In 2002, \"Serious Sam\" for the Xbox was released, which consisted of both games with the additional number of cinematics, an updated scores system, combos, multikills, auto-aiming and other console specific features. A sequel, \"Serious Sam 2\" for both PC and Xbox was released on 11 October 2005, using Serious Engine 2.\n\nIn 2007, development began on \"\", a prequel to the original game. In 2010, Croteam released high definition remakes of the original \"Serious Sam\" games with upgraded textures and models, enhanced engine, user interface and audio, and additional features. \"Serious Sam 3: BFE\" was released for Windows in November 2011, soon followed by macOS and Linux versions. The Xbox 360 version of \"Serious Sam 3: BFE\" was released on Xbox Live Arcade in September 2012, and later made its way to PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Network in March 2014. In December 2014, Croteam released the first-person puzzle game \"The Talos Principle\" for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nCo-founder and chief technical officer Ladavac left Croteam to join Google's Munich-based branch in October 2019 and work on the Stadia project.\n\nFor development of \"Serious Sam: The First Encounter\", Croteam developed the Serious Engine (formerly named S-Cape3D), a proprietary game engine, which, while similar to other engines at the time, was designed to render large environments and support a large number of enemies visible at any time. Serious Engine 2 was developed alongside \"Serious Sam 2\", adding in support for a physics engine, refraction, detailed textures, and high dynamic range lighting.\n\nSerious Engine 3 was used to support the high-definition remakes of \"The First Encounter\" and \"The Second Encounter\" for release on Windows and Xbox 360, adding in true high-dynamic lighting support. As Croteam wanted to target more platforms with the release of \"Serious Sam 3: BFE\", Serious Engine 3 was heavily reworked to support seventh-generation consoles, and became Serious Engine 3.5. With the introduction of eighth-generation consoles, Croteam continued to improve the Serious Engine, releasing it as Serious Engine 4, which premiered with \"The Talos Principle\". Serious Engine 4 is also expected to be used for the upcoming \"Serious Sam 4\", with Croteam claiming it can support up to 100,000 enemies on screen at any time.\n\nIn honour of \"Serious Sam: The First Encounter\" 15th anniversary in 2016, Croteam released the source code for the first Serious Engine under an open-source licence.\n\n"}

In January 1914 he joined Manchester United as an outside left, but soon changed to his favoured half back position. He featured three times during the 1913/14 season before establishing himself in the team the following term. Although he joined Manchester United during the First World War, he quickly established a name for himself as an astute halfback who was an incredibly clean tackler and read the game well.\n\nIn the summer of 1920 he was selected by the Football Association to be part of the 20-man squad that travelled to South Africa for a 14 match tour. Hilditch featured in all three 'tests' against South Africa but it was the closest he came to international recognition.\n\nIn October 1926, after John Chapman was suspended for unknown reasons, Hilditch took over the manager's job for the rest of the season in addition to his playing duties.\n\nA stalwart in the United team for over a decade, he played 322 league games scoring 7 league goals before retiring in 1932 without winning any medals with the club.\n\n"}

The original bridges opened in 1965; prior to that, visitors used a ferry to get to the island. The new bridge, by bypassing the middle island, became the 3rd-longest bridge in Florida. The north end of SR 300 is at US 98 (SR 30) in Eastpoint. It was opened on February 27, 2004.\nInitially, the bridge was designated State Road G1A by the Florida Department of Transportation while Gulf Beach Drive on the island east of the bridge was given the SR 300 designation. Later, the bridge and Gulf Beach Drive were both SR 300. More recently, Gulf Beach Drive lost its State Road designation, leaving only the St. George Island Bridge with the SR 300 designation.

Lynch\n\nKevin Andrew Lynch (January 7, 1918 – April 25, 1984) was an American urban planner and author. He is known for his work on the perceptual form of urban environments and was an early proponent of mental mapping. His most influential books include \"The Image of the City\" (1960), a seminal work on the perceptual form of urban environments, and \"What Time is This Place?\" (1972), which theorizes how the physical environment captures and refigures temporal processes.\n\nA student of architect Frank Lloyd Wright before training in city planning, Lynch spent his academic career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, teaching there from 1948 to 1978. He practiced site planning and urban design professionally with Carr/Lynch Associates, later known as Carr, Lynch, and Sandell.\n\nLynch was born as the youngest child of an Irish-American family on January 7, 1918. He was raised in the Hazel Avenue neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. After graduating from the Francis Parker School in 1935, Lynch matriculated at Yale University intending to study architecture. Finding its pedagogy too conservative, he left to study under Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Lynch later stated that Wright was a great influence, but disagreed with his individualistic social philosophy. Leaving Wright after a year and a half, he enrolled at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York to study engineering in 1939, but did not complete the program and went to work for Chicago architect Paul Schweikher. In 1941, Lynch married Anne Borders, a fellow graduate of the Parker School.\n\nThree weeks after his wedding, Lynch was drafted into the Army Corps of Engineers, serving in the Philippines and Japan through 1944. After the war, he completed his undergraduate education at MIT and received a Bachelor's degree in city planning in 1947.\n\nAfter graduation, Lynch began work in Greensboro, North Carolina as an urban planner but was soon recruited to teach at MIT by Lloyd Rodwin. He began lecturing at MIT the following year, becoming an assistant professor in 1949, a tenured associate professor in 1955, and a full professor in 1963.\n\nIn 1954, after receiving a grant from the Ford Foundation to study urban form in Italy, Lynch and his MIT teaching colleague Gyorgy Kepes were awarded a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study perceptions of the urban environment and urban form. In 1958 Lynch wrote an essay ‘The theory of urban form’ with Lloyd Rodwin where the city is described through the complementary of two systems – flows and adapted spaces – interpreted starting from a group of descriptive categories of urban form. Lynch and Kepes' research was published in 1960 as Lynch's book \"The Image of the City\". In 1970, Lynch received funding from UNESCO to study the use of cities by young people in urban areas of Salta, Melbourne, Toluca, and Krakow, a project summarized in his book \"Growing Up in Cities\" (1977).\n\nLynch provided seminal contributions to the field of city planning through empirical research on how individuals perceive and navigate the urban landscape. His books explore the presence of time and history in the urban environment, how urban environments affect children, and how to harness human perception of the physical form of cities and regions as the conceptual basis for good urban design.\n\nParallel to his academic work, Lynch practiced planning and urban design in partnership with Stephen Carr, with whom he founded Carr/Lynch Associates in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nLynch became professor emeritus in 1978, but continued to write and practice architecture. He died of a heart attack at his summer home at Gay Head on Martha's Vineyard on April 25, 1984.\n\nLynch's most famous work, \"The Image of the City\" (1960), is the result of a five-year study on how observers take in information of the city. Using three American cities as examples (Boston, Jersey City and Los Angeles), Lynch reported that users understood their surroundings in consistent and predictable ways, forming mental maps with five elements:\n\nIn the same book, Lynch also coined the words \"imageability\" and \"wayfinding\". \"Image of the City\" has had important and durable influence in the fields of urban planning and environmental psychology.\n\nAnne Borders Lynch and Kevin Lynch were married in 1941 and had four children. The Lynches were long-term residents of Martha's Vineyard, where Anne continued spending her summers until her death in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Archos manufactures tablets, smartphones, portable media players and portable data storage devices. The name is an anagram of Crohas' last name. Also, in Greek (-αρχος), it's a suffix used in nouns indicating a person with power. The company's slogan has been updated from \"Think Smaller\" to \"On The Go\", and the current \"Entertainment your way\".\n\nArchos has developed a variety of products, including digital audio players, portable video players (PVP), digital video recorders, a personal digital assistant, netbooks, more recently tablet computers using Google Android and Microsoft Windows (tablet PCs), and smartphones.\n\nBy the year 2000, Archos became an important player in the portable media player market and this was demonstrated by the groundbreaking year 2000 release of the very first disk-based digital audio player (DAP) called Jukebox 6000. This product paved the way for the high-capacity DAPs, which finally resulted in the wide adoption of digital and MP3 players. Archos' success during this period was attributed to its strategy of technological leadership, releasing different iterations of a product line, which featured a succession of products with better specifications and technology than their predecessors.\n\nIn the latter part of the 2000s, Archos began to lose to Apple, which - for its part - introduced its own portable devices such as the iPod. This development highlighted a trend in the technology industry where beating competitors to the market and equipping products with the most advanced technology available do not always translate to success. The company started phasing its portable media players in 2008 to focus more on its Android tablet range.\n\nIn 2013, the company entered the mobile phone market by launching a series of smartphone models in the market.

The five tablets were supposed to be launched with Android 2.2 Froyo along with a hold-over release of the Archos 5 without its GPS. Froyo was not released until sometime around December, due to numerous delays with the Archos firmware development team.\n\nUnder the new brandname \"Arnova\", in 2011 Archos released a series of low cost Android tablets for the mass consumer market. They are priced at 100 Euro to 200 Euro (in the U.S. $99 to $199). Current models have resistive touch screens, and uses the RK2818 Rockchip SoC. All versions have Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g).

Archos has mostly been pushing to publicize the Titanium & Platinum series which they announced at CES 2013. In announcing their Titanium & Platinum series, Archos stated that each of the tablet models were made to compete against another major tablet range in the market, but at a lower price:\n\nFormer Archos products since discontinued include ranges of handheld and portable computers, digital camcorders, audiovisual playback equipment, portable storage devices, and peripherals for the Commodore Amiga line.\n\nReleased along with the Generation 5 and Archos TV+ devices in 2007, the Archos Content Portal (ACP) provides video on demand purchase or rental directly to the internet enabled devices. However, there is no PC based software for the service such as iTunes. A major difference from similar services is that given \"portals\" are serviced by different distributors, such as CinemaNow in North America. Archos has numerous ACP partners worldwide but they vary by region.\n\nIn the summer of 2007 French-based Cinebank announced MoovyPlay. The device runs on a kiosk to harddrive rental service with Archos building the 40GB player. The Drive attaches to a Dock similar to those seen in Archos players and connects to a Video Display. The device was launched in France on December 10, 2007 with initial success.\n\nDISH Network Corporation, which owns 19% of Archos since 2005, sold Archos PVPs under the PocketDish brand. There were three versions, the AV700E (AV700), AV500 (AV500), and the AV402E (Gmini 402). While the original products are no longer available, on December 18, 2007 Dish Network released info on a new similar deal with the current generation 605 and 705 Wi-Fi, allowing high speed transfers to the devices from their current HD receivers. Unlike with the original PocketDish, the products will not be sold a Dish rebranding, instead the software plug-in was made available for free for the two products. They are expected to be sold alongside Dish products in January. In 2008 Dish Network's PocketDish page was updated to show the new service and products.\n\nIn May 2007, American Airlines revealed plans of offering modified Archos 604 and 704s to first-class passengers for entertainment during their flight.\n\nOpera Software has provided the web browser for Archos devices since the PMA400. They are a version of Opera for devices similar to that seen on the Wii video game console and the Nokia N800 Internet appliance. On Generation 5 devices Adobe Flash support was added. An update to full Flash 9 support was announced in April 2008 from the current Flash 7.\n\nIn late 2007, SFR, a French mobile phone company, announced to be building a new device with Archos that utilizes 3G communication. It was revealed to be the Archos 5g. The Archos 5g is currently available for a discounted price through SFR for a service contract.\n\nA similar deal to the one with Cinebank was announced with Blockbuster Inc. in 2008. The specifics were revealed and Blockbuster hinted that the service will not be Archos exclusive.\n\nIn 2018, Archos introduced a slew of products to the market. The most notable of these involved the product unveiled in February, which was the very first Android-powered scooter called Citee Connect. Several weeks later, the company announced the Archos Hello, which is touted as an A.I.-powered smart display to challenge the likes of Amazon Echo. The Saphir 50X joined these gadgets in April 2018. This new release was an update to the Archos 50 Saphir, the tech company's rugged phone brand.\n\n\nEnthusiasts web sites :\n"}

He is based on Jerry Ordway's real life friend, Jo Jo Kaminski, described as a \"hard as nails softie\".\n\nBibbo first appears in a Suicide Slum bar called the Ace o' Clubs. When Superman comes in looking for information, Bibbo, thinking this is \"some clown in a Superman suit\", punches Superman, damaging his hand. He gains respect for the Man of Steel. He would later refer to Superman as his \"fav'rit\" hero.\n\nDuring the Eradicator saga, Bibbo teams up with Lobo and Raof, a teleporter and a tribute to Marvel's Nightcrawler, to witness Lobo kill Superman. Lobo gives Bibbo a set of special goggles that will record the battle. All three, however, get drunk on Okarran liquor and thus suffer loss of all memory of the battle, which Superman won by a ruse engineered by the Eradicator artifact. Additionally, Bibbo wore the goggles backwards, and thus the entire recording was of his reactions. As a result, the aliens who retained Lobo to kill Superman have no proof that there even was a battle.\n\nBibbo becomes a more significant part of the comic when he finds a winning lottery ticket dropped by Gangbuster and uses the money to buy the Ace o' Clubs bar and to help those living in the slum.\nBibbo attempts to assist Superman when Superman becomes involved in a drawn-out fight against the murderous Doomsday. Bibbo works with Professor Hamilton on a plan to blast Doomsday with a large laser. They score a direct hit, but the monster is not affected.\n\nWhen Doomsday and Superman ultimately kill each other, Bibbo is on the scene and helps Hamilton use a device to try to perform CPR on Superman, despite the risk of the device killing Bibbo himself. The plan fails and Bibbo is injured. Hamilton takes over the CPR but also fails.\n\nShortly afterward, Bibbo encounters a young man who, his family rendered homeless by Doomsday's rampage, is blatantly selling \"Death of Superman\" commemorative souvenirs during a public commemoration honoring the Man of Steel. At first outraged at the man's crassness, Bibbo feels some sympathy for his losses and buys his entire inventory in order to get him off the street, then offers him a job at the Ace O' Clubs. While Superman is gone, Bibbo takes to putting on a 'disguise' of sorts and helping out on the streets. Around this time he saves a man from suicide. This is mostly told through tall tales concerning various super-villains.\n\nBibbo briefly takes care of a small white dog named Krypto whom he had saved from drowning, not to be confused with the Kryptonian dog of the same name. The name was supposed to be \"Krypton\", but the engraver Bibbo hired to make a name tag made an intentional mistake, trying to extort more money from Bibbo (the price accorded was for six letters). Bibbo took the tag as it was.\n\nA poster seen by the hero Aztek indicates that at one point, Bibbo fought the hero Wildcat during a charity boxing event. Later in the series, The Ace O' Clubs bar is the site of a battle between the life-force devouring Parasite and Aztek. Bibbo and his friends purposely ignore the fight, playing cards instead and trusting others to handle the villain.\n\nIn \"The Power of Shazam!\", Ordway introduces Professor Bibbowski, Bibbo's pacifist scientist brother.\n\nBibbo reappears in \"Superman\" #679, shown as one of the champions of Metropolis that the villainous Atlas defeated. He is established by then as having worked in the Ace of Clubs, even bringing himself to boldly menace Atom Smasher for \"Talking trash about Sooperman\".\n\nBibbo returns in 2016 \"Superman\" #4. He is seen arm-wrestling Hacken and easily beating him, before Superman's fight with Eradicator moves into his bar. Bibbo is shocked to see what appears to be Superman running away from the fight, but quickly realizes Superman is simply trying to lure Eradicator somewhere when there are no innocent bystanders. \n\nLater Bibbo and his niece show up in Superwoman. When Ultrawoman takes over Metropolis, Bibbo is seen trying to start a fight with her minions but is saved by Natasha Irons and Traci 13.\n\nPerry White recommends Clark and Lois take their son over to Bibbo's 'Ace O' Clubs' for burgers. \n\nAt one point, Superman saves Bibbo from being murdered by gun-wielding muggers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term 'phreatic surface' indicates the location where the pore water pressure is under atmospheric conditions (i.e. the pressure head is zero). This surface normally coincides with the water table. The slope of the phreatic surface is assumed to indicate the direction of ground water movement in an unconfined aquifer. \n\nThe phreatic zone, below the phreatic surface where rock and soil is saturated with water, is the counterpart of the vadose zone, or unsaturated zone, above. Unconfined aquifers are also referred to as phreatic aquifers because their upper boundary is provided by the phreatic surface.\n\nIn speleogenesis, a division of speleology, 'phreatic action' forms cave passages by dissolving the limestone in all directions, as opposed to 'vadose action', whereby a stream running in a cave passage erodes a trench in the floor. It occurs when the passage is full of water, and therefore normally only when it is below the water table, and only if the water is not saturated with calcium carbonate or calcium magnesium carbonate. A cave passage formed in this way is characteristically circular or oval in cross-section as limestone is dissolved on all surfaces.\n\nMany cave passages are formed by a combination of phreatic followed by vadose action. Such passages form a keyhole cross section: a round-shaped section at the top and a rectangular trench at the bottom.\n\nA phreatic eruption or steam-blast eruption occurs when magma heats ground or surface water.\n\n"}

During this time of upheaval throughout the Near East and south Russia, she rendered aid to American commercial personnel, Red Cross workers, and U.S. Food Administration officials who were assisting the stricken inhabitants. \"Lawrence\" together with other American destroyers also evacuated thousands of Greek refugees from areas of Asia Minor which had been occupied by Turkish Forces. The destroyer returned to New York 30 October 1923, and resumed operations with the Scouting Fleet.\n\nShe departed New York 3 January 1924 to join in Army-Navy exercises which tested the defenses and facilities of the Panama Canal. In August of that year \"Lawrence\" was stationed off Labrador during the Army around the world flight, returning to Boston, Massachusetts in September to resume operations with the Scouting Fleet. For the next 3 years she performed reserve training cruises, maneuvers along the east coast and engaged in simulated attack exercises on the Hawaiian Islands.\n\n\"Lawrence\" detached from the Scouting Fleet 11 February 1927, and sailed off the coast of Nicaragua to protect American lives and property during the Civil War then underway in that country.

She decommissioned at San Diego 13 September 1938.\n\nOnce again \"Lawrence\" recommissioned 26 September 1939, Cmdr. H. D. Clarke in command, and sailed 2 months later for maneuvers and patrol in the Caribbean. Following training operations, she arrived at Boston 1 March 1940, and later that month was assigned to the east coast sound school at New London, Connecticut. The destroyer conducted tactical exercises along the east coast until 3 December when she steamed for the Pacific.\n\nArriving at San Francisco, California on the 27th, she was later assigned to the Sound School at San Diego, continuing these operations until America's declaration of war on Japan. During the early months of the war the destroyer performed convoy escort operations between San Francisco and Seattle, Washington. \"Lawrence\" departed San Francisco 13 August 1942 to escort a troop convoy en route to Kodiak, Alaska, arriving there 7 days later. For the next month the destroyer covered convoy approaches between Kodiak, Dutch Harbor, and Adak before returning to San Francisco 27 September.\n\nBased at Treasure Island, California for the rest of the war, \"Lawrence\" served on patrol and escort operations to the approaches of San Francisco Bay.

{"id": "1797004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797004", "title": "Sexual addiction", "text": "Sexual addiction\n\nSexual addiction, also known as sex addiction, is a state characterized by [[compulsive]] participation or engagement in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], particularly [[sexual intercourse]], despite negative consequences.\n\nProponents of a diagnostic model for sexual addiction consider it to be one of several sex-related disorders within [[hypersexual disorder]]. The term \"sexual dependence\" is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their [[sexual urges]], behaviors, or thoughts. Related or synonymous models of pathological sexual behavior include [[hypersexuality]] (nymphomania and satyriasis), [[erotomania]], [[Don Juanism]] (or Don Juanitaism), and [[paraphilia]]-related disorders.\n\nThe concept of sexual addiction is contentious. There is considerable debate among [[psychiatrists]], [[psychologist]]s, [[sexologist]]s, and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction, and therefore its classification and possible diagnosis. [[Animal research]] has established that compulsive sexual behavior arises from the same [[transcriptional]] and [[epigenetic]] mechanisms that mediate [[drug addiction]] in laboratory animals; however, sexual addiction is not a clinical diagnosis in either the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]] medical classifications of diseases and medical disorders. Some argue that applying such concepts to normal behaviors such as sex can be problematic, and suggest that applying medical models such as addiction to human sexuality can serve to [[Slut-shaming|pathologise normal behavior]] and cause harm.\n\nThe [[ICD-11]] created a new condition classification, compulsive sexual behavior, to cover \"a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour\".\n\nNone of the official diagnostic classification frameworks list \"sexual addiction\" as a distinct disorder.\n\nThe [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) publishes and periodically updates the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), a widely recognized compendium of mental health diagnostics.\n\nThe version published in 1987 (DSM-III-R), referred to \"distress about a pattern of repeated sexual conquests or other forms of [[paraphilia|nonparaphilic]] sexual addiction, involving a succession of people who exist only as things to be used.\" The reference to sexual addiction was subsequently removed. The DSM-IV-TR, published in 2000 (DSM-IV-TR), did not include sexual addiction as a mental disorder.\n\nSome authors suggested that sexual addiction should be re-introduced into the DSM system; however, sexual addiction was rejected for inclusion in the [[DSM-5]], which was published in 2013. Darrel Regier, vice-chair of the DSM-5 task force, said that \"[A]lthough '[[hypersexuality]]' is a proposed new addition...[the phenomenon] was not at the point where we were ready to call it an addiction.\" The proposed diagnosis does not make the cut as an official diagnosis due to a lack of research into diagnostic criteria for compulsive sexual behavior, according to the APA.\n\nThe World Health Organization produces the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which is not limited to mental disorders. The most recent approved version of that document, ICD-10, includes \"excessive sexual drive\" as a diagnosis (code F52.7), subdividing it into \"satyriasis\" (for males) and \"nymphomania\" (for females). However, the ICD categorizes these diagnoses as compulsive behaviors or impulse control disorders and not addiction. The most recent (yet unapproved) version of that document, ICD-11, includes \"compulsive sexual behavior disorder\" as a diagnosis (code 6C72)—it does not use the addiction model.\n\nThe [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]] produces the [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]] (CCMD), which is currently in its third edition the CCMD-3 does not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis.\n\nSome mental health providers have proposed various, but similar, criteria for diagnosing sexual addiction, including [[Patrick Carnes]], and [[Aviel Goodman]]. Carnes authored the first clinical book about sex addiction in 1983, based on his own empirical research. His diagnostic model is still largely utilized by the thousands of certified sex addiction therapists (CSATs) trained by the organization he founded. No diagnostic proposal for sex addiction has been adopted into any official government diagnostic manual, however.\n\nDuring the update of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to version 5 (DSM-5), the APA rejected two independent proposals for inclusion.\n\nIn 2011, the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] (ASAM), the largest medical consensus of physicians dedicated to treating and preventing addiction, redefined addiction as a chronic brain disorder, which for the first time broadened the definition of addiction from substances to include addictive behaviors and reward-seeking, such as gambling and sex.\n\nThe ICD, DSM and CCMD list promiscuity as a prevalent and problematic symptom for [[Borderline personality disorder|Borderline Personality Disorder]]. Individuals with this diagnosis sometimes engage in sexual behaviors that can appear out of control, distressing the individual or attracting negative reactions from others. There is therefore a risk that a person presenting with sex addiction, may in fact be suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder. This may lead to inappropriate or incomplete treatment.\n\nIn November 2016, the [[American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists]] (AASECT), the official body for sex and relationship therapy in the United States, issued a position statement on Sex Addiction that states that AASECT, \"...does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder, and does not find the sexual addiction training and treatment methods and educational pedagogies to be adequately informed by accurate human sexuality knowledge. Therefore, it is the position of AASECT that linking problems related to sexual urges, thoughts or behaviors to a porn/sexual addiction process cannot be advanced by AASECT as a standard of practice for sexuality education delivery, counseling or therapy.\"\n\nIn 2017, three new USA sexual health organizations found no support for the idea that sex or adult films were addictive in their position statement.\n\nIn 16 November 2017 the [[Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers]] (ATSA) published a position against sending sex offenders to sex addiction treatment facilities. Those centers argued that \"illegal\" behaviors were symptoms of sex addiction, which ATSA challenged they had no scientific evidence to support.\n\nAnimal research involving rats that exhibit compulsive sexual behavior has identified that this behavior is mediated through the same molecular mechanisms in the brain that mediate drug addiction. Sexual activity is an [[intrinsic reward]] that has been shown to act as a [[positive reinforcer]], strongly activate the [[reward system]], and induce the accumulation of [[ΔFosB]] in part of the [[striatum]] (specifically, the [[nucleus accumbens]]). Chronic and excessive activation of certain pathways within the reward system and the accumulation of ΔFosB in a specific group of neurons within the nucleus accumbens has been directly implicated in the development of the compulsive behavior that characterizes addiction.\n\nIn humans, a [[dopamine dysregulation syndrome]], characterized by drug-induced compulsive engagement in sexual activity or gambling, has also been observed in some individuals taking [[dopaminergic]] medications.\nCurrent experimental models of addiction to natural rewards and drug reward demonstrate common alterations in [[gene expression]] in the [[mesocorticolimbic projection]]. [[ΔFosB]] is the most significant [[gene transcription]] factor involved in addiction, since its [[viral vector|viral]] or genetic overexpression in the [[nucleus accumbens]] is [[necessary and sufficient]] for most of the neural adaptations and plasticity that occur; it has been implicated in addictions to [[alcoholism|alcohol]], [[cannabinoid]]s, [[cocaine]], [[nicotine]], [[opioids]], [[phenylcyclidine]], and [[substituted amphetamines]]. [[ΔJunD]] is the transcription factor which directly opposes ΔFosB. Increases in nucleus accumbens ΔJunD expression can reduce or, with a large increase, even block most of the neural alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB).\n\nΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. Natural rewards, like drugs of abuse, induce ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens, and chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological addictive state. Thus, ΔFosB is also the key transcription factor involved in addictions to natural rewards as well, and sexual addictions in particular, since ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens is critical for the reinforcing effects of sexual reward. Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that psychostimulants and sexual reward possess cross-sensitization effects and act on common biomolecular mechanisms of addiction-related neuroplasticity which are mediated through ΔFosB.\n\nAs of 2017, none of the official regulatory bodies for [[Sex therapy|Psychosexual Counselling]] or [[Relationship counseling|Sex and Relationship therapy]], have accepted sex addiction as a distinct entity with associated treatment protocols. Indeed, some practitioners regard sex addiction as a potentially harmful diagnosis and draw parallels with gay conversion therapy. As a result, treatment for sex addiction is more often provided by addiction professionals than psychosexual specialists.\n\n[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] is a common form of behavioral treatment for addictions and maladaptive behaviors in general. [[Dialectical behavior therapy]] has been shown to improve treatment outcomes as well. [[Certified Sex Addiction Therapist]]s (CSAT) a group of sexual addiction therapists certified by the [[International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals]] offer specialized behavioral therapy designed specifically for sexual addiction. Their treatments have yet to be subject to peer-review, so it is unclear if they help or harm patients.\n\nThe term \"pre-exposure prophylaxis\" (PrEP) generally refers to the use of [[antiviral drugs]] to help [[prevention of HIV/AIDS|prevent AIDS]]. PrEP is an optional treatment for people who are HIV-negative, but have a substantial risk of getting an HIV infection.\n\nIn the US, most insurance plans cover these drugs.\n\nAccording to a systematic review from 2014, observed prevalence rates of sexual addiction/hypersexual disorder range from 3% to 6%. Some studies suggest that sex addicts are disproportionately male, at 80%.\n\nSex addiction as a term first emerged in the mid-1970s when various members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] sought to apply the principles of [[twelve-step program|12-steps]] toward sexual recovery from serial infidelity and other unmanageable compulsive sex behaviors that were similar to the powerlessness and un-manageability they experienced with alcoholism. Multiple 12-step style self-help groups now exist for people who identify as sex addicts, including [[Sex Addicts Anonymous]], [[Sexaholics Anonymous]], [[Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous]], and [[Sexual Compulsives Anonymous]].\n\nThe controversy surrounding sexual addiction is centered around its identification, through a diagnostic model, in a clinical setting. As noted in current medical literature reviews, compulsive sexual behavior has been observed in humans; drug-induced compulsive sexual behavior has also been noted clinically in some individuals taking [[dopaminergic]] drugs. Moreover, some research suggests compulsive engagement in sexual behavior despite negative consequences in animal models. Since current diagnostic models use drug-related concepts as diagnostic criteria for addictions, these are ill-suited for modelling compulsive behaviors in a clinical setting. Consequently, diagnostic classification systems, such as the DSM, do not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis because there is currently \"insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders\". A 2014 systematic review on sexual addiction indicated that the \"lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\"\nThere have been debates regarding the definition and existence of sexual addictions for decades, as the issue was covered in a 1994 journal article. The [[Mayo Clinic]] considers sexual addiction a form of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] and refer to it as \"sexual compulsivity\" (note that by definition, an addiction is a compulsion toward rewarding stimuli). A paper dating back to 1988 and a journal comment letter published in 2006 asserted that sex addiction is itself a myth, a by-product of cultural and other influences. The 1988 paper argued that the condition is instead a way of projecting [[social stigma]] onto patients.\n\nIn a report from 2003, [[Marty Klein]], stated that \"the concept of sex addiction provides an excellent example of a model that is both sex-negative and politically disastrous.\" Klein singled out a number of features that he considered crucial limitations of the sex addiction model and stated that the diagnostic criteria for sexual addiction are easy to find on the internet. Drawing on the \"[[International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals#Resources|Sexual Addiction Screening Test]]\", he stated that \"the sexual addiction diagnostic criteria make problems of nonproblematic experiences, and as a result pathologize a majority of people.\"\n\nSexual addiction has been the main theme in a variety of films including \"[[Diary of a Sex Addict]]\", \"[[I Am a Sex Addict]]\", \"[[Black Snake Moan (film)|Black Snake Moan]]\", \"[[Confessions of a Porn Addict]]\", \"[[Shame (2011 film)|Shame]]\", \"[[Thanks for Sharing]]\", \"[[Don Jon]]\", and \"[[Choke (film)|Choke]]\".\n\n\nBooks that provide overview history and treatment techniques for sexual addiction include:\n\n\nBooks focusing on partners of sex addicts:\n\n\nDiscussions of the concept of sexual addiction:\n\n[[Category:Paraphilias]]\n[[Category:Sexual addiction| ]]\n[[Category:Sexual health]]\n[[Category:Behavioral addiction]]"}

In English terms, \"win-win\" maybe the correct translation. Sang(相) means \"mutual\" or \"together\" and Saeng(生) means \"live\" or \"survive\". Because of its literal meaning, mutual life-giving or win-win, this term is used by Korean politicians very often.\n\nHowever, just a simple, literal translation of mutual life-giving or win-win is not all of its meaning. Before understanding Sangsaeng further, it is recommended that you understand Cosmic year because the meaning of Sangsaeng can be explained in more detail in the context of Cosmic year. \n\nSangsaeng is necessary because governing principles in Early Heaven (cosmic spring, summer) and Later Heaven (cosmic autumn, winter) are different. In Early Heaven, the principle of Sanggeuk(相克 : mutual conflict) governs all lives. Therefore, all lives in the world are suffering even though they do not want. However, in Later Heaven, the principle of Sangsaeng(相生 : mutual life-giving) governs all lives in the world. \n\nIn daily life, mutual life-giving is to work for the well-being of others, and at the time of gaebyeok, the focus of mutual life-giving will be to save life. Sharing teachings with others is also an act of mutual life-giving. Throughout history people have prospered at the expense of others, but in Jeungic philosophy, from now on people can only prosper by benefiting others.\n\nQuote from Dojeon\n\n"}

Appearing as an elderly man wearing a tuxedo and thick-framed glasses, he is usually shown stepping slowly off a bus before he suddenly performs a frenetic dance to an instrumental version of the Vengaboys song \"We Like to Party\" to invite stressed and overworked people to Six Flags.\n\nAccording to \"USA Today\", Mr. Six is the creation of Doner Advertising of Southfield, Michigan. The success of the ad became such that Six Flags toured the vintage bus featured in the ad to all of its 31 parks and sold T-shirts based on the Mr. Six advertisement. Mr. Six also appeared on the nationally broadcast U.S. TV morning show \"Good Morning America\".\n\nThe first airing introduced Mr. Six as an apparently elderly, slow-moving man dressed in his trademark tuxedo and large glasses, pulling up in front of a house in a retro-style bus. The occupants of the house are sitting around the front yard apparently very bored. Mr. Six slowly shuffles off the bus, then suddenly starts performing a high-energy dance routine as \"We Like to Party\" begins playing, and invites the bored family to Six Flags. The dance he performs borrows moves from the Melbourne shuffle, jumpstyle, and Techtonik. Subsequent ads showed different variations of Mr. Six dancing and inviting people to Six Flags. The role was, initially, non-speaking.\n\nOn July 9, 2004, Six Flags Great America held a contest to find the best person who could impersonate the new \"Ambassador of Fun\" Mr. Six and dance like him. The reward would be $2,500 cash and other small prizes. About 200 people, who wore tuxedos and red bow ties, went out onto the stage and danced. The winner of the contest was 13-year-old Jordan Pope. Jim Crowley, Six Flags Great America marketing director, said, \"Jordan truly embodies the spirit of Six Flags!...He had Mr. Six's unique dance moves down to a science, the crowd went wild when he took the stage!\"\n\nOn November 29, 2005, Daniel Snyder, owner of the NFL's Washington Redskins, took over Six Flags and on the very next day, he announced the retirement of the ad campaign. Snyder said that Mr. Six was \"pointless.\" Mr. Six and the \"It's Playtime!\" motto would be dropped and Six Flags' next ad campaign would be called \"Friendly, Clean, Fast, Safe, Service.\" (Despite this, the mascot was still prominently featured at Six Flags theme parks on merchandise until his revival in 2009.) The Mr. Six campaign was replaced by the \"More Flags, More Fun\" campaign, which introduced an unnamed Asian character shouting the tagline at viewers.\n\nOn February 2, 2009, Mr. Six began appearing in place of the unnamed Asian character in the \"More Flags, More Fun\" ads on the Six Flags website. In March 2009, Six Flags announced the return of Mr. Six to promote their 2009 season opening in numerous press releases. Mr. Six also resumed appearances in a number of new television commercials where he dances and says the \"More Flags, More Fun\" tagline, alongside his sidekick Little Six, a much younger version of himself.\n\nMr. Six appeared as a bobblehead in the Six Flags New for 2017 Announcement video.\n\nThough Mr. Six was popular with the general public and park-goers, the character was described in a \"Time Magazine\" opinion piece as \"creepy\".\n\n\n\n"}

He has been described as \"the father of modern mountain rescue in Scotland\". He made an attempt to climb Everest in 1953, and is credited with inventing the first all-metal ice-axe, and a lightweight stretcher, widely used in mountain and helicopter rescue.\n\nHe was born Hamish McInnes in Gatehouse of Fleet, in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire in Galloway, Scotland, in 1930. He was the youngest child, having three sisters and a brother eighteen years older than himself. His father served in the Chinese police in Shanghai, then returned to join the British army and the Canadian army during World War I. By the age of 16, MacInness had already climbed on the Matterhorn, and at age 17 had built his own motor car.\n\nHe made the first winter ascent of Crowberry Ridge Direct and of Raven's Gully on Buachaille Etive Mòr with Chris Bonington in 1953. He designed the first all-metal ice axe, and is credited with introducing the short ice axe and hammer with inclined picks for Scottish winter work in the early 1960s. He pioneered the exploration of the Glencoe cliffs for winter work with the Glencoe School of Winter Climbing and for many years led the area's Mountain Rescue team. He is recognised as having developed modern mountain rescue in Scotland, setting up the Search and Rescue Dog Association and the Avalanche Information Service, and inventing the MacInnes stretcher, which is used for rescues worldwide. In 1975, MacInnes was deputy leader to Bonington's Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition, which included Dougal Haston and Doug Scott.\n\nAlthough never an official member, MacInnes climbed extensively with the Creagh Dhu, Glasgow-based climbing club as well as with the rival Aberdeen clubs and joined forces with Tom Patey to make the first winter traverse of the Cuillin Ridge on Skye. He was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2003 and received the Scottish Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture in 2008.\n\nHe has been involved with a number of films, as climber, climbing double and safety officer, including \"The Eiger Sanction\" and \"The Mission\", and has written numerous books on mountaineering, including the \"International Mountain Rescue Handbook\" (1972), regarded as the standard manual worldwide, and \"Callout\" (1973), his classic account of his experiences leading the Glencoe Rescue team.\n\nMacInnes acquired a number of nicknames within the mountaineering community, most noteworthy of which are 'The Fox of Glencoe' and 'MacPiton'.\n\nMacInnes was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to mountaineering and mountain rescue in Scotland in the New Year's Honours list of December 1978. He received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1992, and Stirling University in 1997.\n\nHamish Macinnes lived in Glen Coe for many years. Until 1998, he resided at 'Allt Na Reigh' a cottage within the glen that was subsequently purchased by the sex offender, Jimmy Savile. \n\nIn 2014, MacInnes suffered a urinary tract infection which rendered him severely confused and suffering from delirium. He was 'sectioned' into a psychiatric hospital in the Scottish Highlands. From there he made multiple attempts to escape, including scaling up the outside of the hospital to stand on its roof. Eventually recovering from the illness, he was left with no memory of his former life. In 2018 a documentary film was produced for BBC Scotland, titled \"Final Ascent:The Legend of Hamish MacInnes\". Introduced by his friend, Michael Palin, it recounts the story of MacInnes's life and achievements, and how he used archive footage, his photographs and his many books to \"recover his memories and rescue himself\".    \n\n\n"}

The movie stars Isabelle Adjani, Daniel Auteuil, Virna Lisi and Vincent Pérez. An abridged version of the film was released as Queen Margot in North America, and in the United Kingdom under its original French title.\n\nThe film was a box-office success, grossing $2,017,346 in the United States when given limited theatrical release as well as in other countries such as Germany where it gained 260,000 admissions and Argentina where it received 530,800. The film also had a total of 2,002,915 admissions in France.\n\nIt won the Jury Prize and Best Actress Award at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, as well as five César Awards.

Catherine decides to make an overture of goodwill by offering up her daughter Margot in marriage to Henri de Bourbon, a prominent Huguenot and King of Navarre, although she also schemes to bring about the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572, when thousands of Protestants are slaughtered. The marriage goes forward but Margot, who does not love Henri, begins a passionate affair with the soldier La Môle, also a Protestant from a well-to-do family.

However, its American distributor, Miramax, asked the director to re-edit the movie to 145 minutes, and this version was the version seen in cinemas outside France and later on video. The full-length version was available for a limited period in the United Kingdom on VHS in a collectors' edition box set in 1995, but all further releases, including the DVD, have used the 145 minute cut.\n\nThe re-edited version not only removed scenes, it also added a scene between Margot and La Môle, in which they stand outdoors wrapped in a red cloak. The director had cut this scene from the original 'full-length' version. The scene was re-inserted because Miramax insisted that the relationship between the two characters be more substantial, as the romance was to become the focal point for the American marketing campaign. The 'red cloak' scene appears on the US DVD cover. In contrast the Region 2 European DVD cover uses the original poster, showing a shocked Margot bespattered with blood.\n\n"}

They focus on three of the people who populate The Midnight Bell pub in London; the stories interconnect.\n\nThe first book in particular contains autobiographical elements—Hamilton worked in London pubs before becoming a successful writer, was infatuated with a prostitute at that time, and eventually died of liver failure caused by alcoholism. The books are also notable for their portrayal of working class London in the inter-war period.\n\nThe trilogy was published in paperback by Vintage in 2004 ().\n\n\"The Midnight Bell\" tells the story of Bob, a sailor turned bar waiter who falls in love with Jenny, a prostitute who visits the pub. Ella, the barmaid at the pub, is secretly in love with Bob. Eventually, Jenny loses interest once Bob has spent all his savings on her.\n\n\"The Siege of Pleasure\" relates Jenny's early life as a servant, and her descent into prostitution. Bob and Ella do not feature at all in this novel.\n\n\"The Plains of Cement\" focuses on Ella, and is set during the events in \"The Midnight Bell\", although from a different perspective. Ella, still nursing an untold affection for Bob, has to deal with the increasingly unwelcome advances of Ernest Eccles, an elderly customer of the pub.

He is considered \"the Father of Modern Bouldering\" by many climbers.\n\nAs a child, Gill lived in several Southern cities, including Atlanta, Georgia, where he graduated from Bass High School in 1954 and attended Georgia Tech 1954−1956. He graduated from the University of Georgia with a degree in mathematics in 1958, and entered the USAF as a second lieutenant. He attended a special graduate meteorology program at the University of Chicago 1958−1959, then was assigned to Glasgow AFB, Montana, until 1962. He resigned from the USAF Reserves as a captain several years later. After obtaining an MA in mathematics from the University of Alabama in 1964, Gill became an instructor at Murray State University 1964−1967. In 1967 he enrolled as a graduate student at Colorado State University, and received his PhD in classical complex analysis in 1971. His dissertation, on Möbius transformations, was supervised by Arne Magnus. In 2000, Gill retired as professor of mathematics from the University of Southern Colorado. During his career as a college teacher, in his spare time he wrote and published approximately thirty individually authored research papers in the analytic theory of continued fractions and related topics. He also started a minor mathematical journal entitled \"Communications in the Analytic Theory of Continued Fractions\" with John McCabe of St Andrews University.\n\nJohn Gill began mountain and rock climbing in 1953 as a traditional climber. By the mid-1950s he had begun to specialize on very short, acrobatic routes on outcrops and boulders, establishing problems in the 1950s and early 1960s considerably harder than those existing at the time. Being a gymnast and thinking of climbing as an extension of gymnastics rather than hiking, in the mid-1950s he introduced the use of gymnastic chalk into American rock climbing. The use of chalk then spread internationally throughout the climbing world. At the same time he introduced \"controlled dynamics\" (see dyno), recommending it as a technique of choice, as well as one of necessity.\n\nGill's climbing style showed the influence of formal gymnastics. He emphasized form and grace of motion over simple efficiency, the cornerstone of contemporary climbing. His performances, as recorded on film taken when he was forty (\"Disciples of Gill\", 2009), demonstrate straight lines and minimal contact with the rock. He preferred an application of strength and sometimes avoided efficient moves like the heel hook, which he considered unaesthetic. Gill's approach to bouldering – artistic style being on a par with difficulty – was rarely followed by climbers of his generation and is considered unusual today, difficulty remaining paramount. He also practised bouldering as a form of moving meditation.\n\nAlthough certainly not the first serious boulderer — his notable predecessors include Oscar Eckenstein (1859–1921) and Pierre Allain (1904–2000) — Gill was probably the first climber in the history of rock climbing to make bouldering his primary specialty and to advocate acceptance of bouldering as a legitimate sport in its own right, to be pursued wherever the terrain is suitable. His focus on bouldering and the high difficulty levels he established inspired a number of traditional climbers to take a more serious view of the sport, which, for the most part had been seen merely as training for longer roped climbs.\n\n\"\". . . his introduction of chalk and dynamic movement marked the beginning of modern climbing in America.\"\"\n\nIn the Tetons, in 1958, John Gill climbed a short route on \"Baxter's Pinnacle\" that lies in the 5.10 realm, before that grade was formally recognized — one of the first to be done in America. By the end of the 1950s, Gill had reached what would now be considered V9 levels on a few eliminate boulder problems. (He later stated he probably never progressed beyond V10 throughout his climbing career.). \n\nTwo of his problems on Red Cross Rock in the Tetons — a V8 in 1957 and a V9 in 1959 — set new standards of bouldering difficulty. And his 1961 route on a steep face of a small granite spire named the \"Thimble\" (Needles of South Dakota) — an unrehearsed and unroped 30-foot 5.12a free-solo climb (or V4 or V5 highball)— is considered one of the great classics of modern climbing, and — if considered a climb (as Gill did) — may well be the first at the 5.12 grade. Gill climbed the route without the benefit of modern climbing shoes, significantly increasing the difficulty of the climb.\n\nJohn Gill received the 2008 American Alpine Club's \"Robert & Miriam Underhill Award\" for outstanding climbing achievement.\n\nJohn Gill introduced, in the 1950s, a very early – if not the first – grading system specifically designed for bouldering and not restricted to a particular area. The system, (B1, B2, B3), had two subjective levels of difficulty, and one objective level, and was predicated on prevailing and future standards attained in traditional rock climbing. The introduction of sport climbing some twenty years later and more intense competition weakened the philosophical underpinnings of the three-tiered structure, although climbers such as Jim Holloway adopted \"personal\" three-level systems similar to Gill's. Today, Gill's B-system is rarely used, abandoned in favor of open-ended scales of difficulty.\n\nAs an amateur gymnast in the 1950s, 6'2\" and 180 pounds, Gill specialized in the competitive rope climb and the still rings, achieving a time of 3.4 seconds for the 20' rope climb (from seated position on the floor, arms only) and accomplishing a number of difficult stunts on the rings, including inverted and olympic crosses, giant swings, and slow pulls from hang to handstand. He also engaged in what are now called bodyweight exercises similar to gymnastics, achieving seven one-arm pullups with the right arm and five with the left, several one-finger one-arm pullups, one-arm pullups carrying twenty pounds, one-arm pullups on a one-half inch ledge, and one-arm front levers.\n\nGill still enjoys doing mild bodyweight exercises.\n\nAfter retiring, Gill spent several years researching the origins of rock climbing, particularly bouldering. He also compiled a chronicle of bodyweight feats associated with climbing. These results, along with a history of gymnastic rope climbing, may be found on his website.\n\nGill began studying the convergence behavior of infinite compositions of complex functions in the late 1960s, focusing on linear fractional transformations. After establishing sufficient conditions for convergence in the parabolic and elliptic cases he discovered a way to accelerate convergence of limit periodic continued fractions using an attractive fixed point, then a way to analytically continue certain continued fractions using a repulsive fixed point. He developed initial theory on the convergence of more general infinite compositions satisfying contractive conditions, leading to a paper by L. Lorentzen describing convergence of sequences of forward (or right or inner) compositions of analytic functions that uniformly contract into a compact subset of a simply connected domain. Gill then developed a similar theory for left (or backward or outer) compositions of analytic functions under similar hypotheses.\n\n"}

He succeeded Sir Matt Busby as manager of Manchester United in 1969.\n\nFollowing his tenure at the Manchester United bench, McGuinness had a four year long stay in Greece, leading Panachaiki through their first appearance in a European competition, the 1973–74 UEFA Cup.\n\nMcGuinness' son Paul was Manchester United's U-18 team manager and assistant director of their youth academy for 17- to 21-year-olds.\n\nAs a player, he captained Manchester, Lancashire and England at schoolboy level, and signed for Manchester United in January 1953. He made his first team debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 8 October 1955, turning 18 later that month. Competition for places was fierce but he played in enough matches to qualify for a medal when United won the league in 1956.\n\nHe was still a United player at the time of the Munich air disaster in 1958, but an injury had prevented him from playing so he was not on the plane that crashed. A broken leg in the 1959–60 season finished his playing career when he was only 22, and came just after he had been capped twice at senior level by the England team.\n\nMcGuinness continued to be involved at Manchester United after the end of his playing career, getting heavily involved in coaching, and in 1964, he replaced Jimmy Murphy as reserve team manager, as Murphy left that role after managing the reserve team to a sixth FA Youth Cup triumph. In 1969, McGuinness was promoted from reserve team manager to manager of the first team after Matt Busby retired as manager at the end of the 1968–69 season. Appointed as Busby's successor in June 1969 at the age of 31, at a time when the Manchester United side was in transition and Busby had moved upstairs to become general manager, McGuinness's reign as Manchester United manager was not as successful as United had hoped. But McGuinness did lead United to three cup semi-finals during his reign, one in the FA Cup and two in the League Cup.\n\nMcGuinness was sacked in December 1970, after a dramatic comeback which saw United draw 4–4 with Derby County in a league fixture at the Baseball Ground. He returned to his old job as reserve team manager before leaving the club at the end of the season to become manager of Greek side Aris Thessaloniki. Meanwhile, Busby was re-appointed as manager until the end of the season, following McGuinness' dismissal as first team manager, until Frank O'Farrell was named as Manchester United's new manager in June 1971.\n\nUnder McGuinness, Aris finished fourth in the 1971–72 Alpha Ethniki season, and ninth a year later, albeit being tied with three teams in sixth position. He took over Panachaiki in 1973, finishing sixth in the Alpha Ethniki his first year while advancing to the UEFA Cup second round in the team's first ever European campaign. Panachaiki finished seventh in the 1974–75 Alpha Ethniki season and parted with McGuinness.\n\nIn 1975, McGuinness was hired by York City. On arriving at York, he took over a side which had just recorded its highest-ever league finish, only to take them through two successive relegations before leaving midway through a season which ended with York having to apply for re-election to the Football League. Later he worked as assistant manager and then caretaker manager at Hull City, and was on the coaching staff at Bury, taking over as interim manager prior to the appointment of Sam Ellis in 1989.\n\nManchester United\n"}

The new railroad, the San Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad (SDIY), which commenced operations on October 15, 1984, did not want to invest the $5.5 million necessary to repair the collapsed tunnels and bridges in the Carrizo Gorge. CZRY Shareholders Gary Sweetwood and Benny L. Wright of local construction company East County Dirt Works, however, believed that the investment would be worthwhile and negotiated trackage rights on the line. The agreement required a fee of 6.9% imposed by SDIY, for the gross revenues from any freight on the SD&AE's \"Desert Line\" and a fee of 2% by the SD&AE Railway Company.\n\nIn 2000, FNM, owner of the Tijuana-Tecate segment, was privatized, transferring the administration to the State of Baja California.\n\nOn July 1, 2000, CZRY won the bid by the Administrator of the Tijuana-Tecate short line to operate as a technical-operational entity for rail service of the federally owned 44 miles from border to border, after SDIY exited operations of the segment. The CZRY later reopened the Desert Line in April 2004.\nSand hauling was the primary business for the CZRY from 1999 to 2005. The sand was used in making ready-mixed concrete for the construction markets in San Diego County, as it was loaded from Lindero to Campo and later from the Imperial Valley desert near Silica to Campo until 2007. There was also minor traffic of other goods between the U.S. and Mexico, mainly lumber for import. Rail car storage is another source of revenue on the east end of the Desert Line.\n\nIn October 2008, facing deteriorating conditions in the Desert Line and preparation for transportation projects in Baja California, the railroad embargoed the line from Plaster City to Campo for all revenue freight.\n\nCZRY discontinued operations of the Tijuana-Tecate segment in the end of 2011. The contract was renewed in favor of Baja California Railroad, Inc. by the government of Baja California.\n\nIn December 2012, SD&AE, owner of the line, entered into a 50-year operating lease with the Pacific Imperial Railroad company for freight trains. The lease requires that certain operating goals and repairs be completed in a specific time frame. The lease also calls for a $1,000,000 yearly payment for the rights to operate freight trains, or 15% gross revenues, or any qualified value. With this lease, the operating rights of CZRY ended.\n\nCarrizo Gorge Railway never owned any locomotives, but leased from various places. The railroad leased several locomotives from its employees and stockholder's interests from East County Dirt Works (ECDW).\n\nAfter the Desert line was reopened, CZRY leased Union Pacific power, such as GP38-2's and GP60's. Union Pacific went to court to collect for non-payment of the lease and a return of the locomotives. They were later returned to Union Pacific after the enactment of the embargo.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1797053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797053", "title": "Channel catfish", "text": "Channel catfish\n\nThe channel catfish (\"Ictalurus punctatus\") is North America's most numerous catfish species. It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \"channel cat\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with around 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States.\n\nChannel catfish are native to the Nearctic, being well distributed in lower Canada and the eastern and northern United States, as well as parts of northern Mexico. They have also been introduced into some waters of landlocked Europe (Czech Republic and Romania) and parts of Malaysia and almost as many parts of Indonesia. They thrive in small and large rivers, reservoirs, natural lakes, and ponds. Channel \"cats\" are cavity nesters, meaning they lay their eggs in crevices, hollows, or debris, to protect them from swift currents. In Canada, the species is largely, though not exclusively, limited to the Great Lakes watershed from Lake Nipigon southward.\n\nChannel catfish possess very keen senses of smell and taste. At the pits of their nostrils (nares) are very sensitive odor-sensing organs with a very high concentration of olfactory receptors. In channel catfish, these organs are sensitive enough to detect several amino acids at about one part per 100 million in water. In addition, the channel catfish has taste buds distributed over the surface of its entire body. These buds are especially concentrated on the fish's four pair of barbels (whiskers) surrounding the mouth — about 25 buds per square millimeter. This combination of exceptional senses of taste and smell allows the channel catfish to find food in dark, stained, or muddy water with relative ease. They also possess a Weberian apparatus, which amplifies sound waves that would otherwise not be perceivable.\n\nA member of the American catfish genus \"Ictalurus\", channel catfish have a top-end size of about 40–50 pounds (18–23 kg). The world record channel catfish weighed 58 pounds, and was taken from the Santee-Cooper Reservoir in South Carolina, on July 7, 1964. Realistically, a channel catfish over 20 lb (9 kg) is a spectacular specimen, and most catfish anglers view a 10-lb (4.5-kg) fish as a very admirable catch. Furthermore, the average size channel catfish an angler could expect to find in most waterways would be between 2 and 4 pounds.\n\nChannel catfish often coexist in the same waterways with its close relative, the blue catfish, which is somewhat less common, but tends to grow much larger (with several specimens confirmed to weigh above 100 lb).\n\nAs channel catfish grow longer, they increase in weight. The relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between length (L, in cm) and weight (W, in kg) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form:\n\nInvariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, formula_2 is the length of a typical fish weighing 1 kg. For channel catfish, b = 3.2293, somewhat higher than for many common species, and formula_3 cm.\n\nCatfish have enhanced capabilities of taste perception, hence called the “swimming tongue”, due to the presence of taste buds all over the external body surface and inside the oropharyngeal cavity. Specifically, they have high sensitivity to amino acids, which explains their unique communication methods as follows. The catfish has a facial taste system that is extremely responsive to L-alanine and L-arginine. More specifically, their facial taste system senses heightened levels of L-amino acids in freshwater. Feeding behavior to food is due to amino acids released by food. This is reported to cause maxillary and mandibular barbell movements, which orient the catfish's posture and food search. When the food stimulates the taste receptors, it causes more excitation which see as exaggerated biting, turning, or mastication.\n\nThe channel catfish is adapted to limited light conditions. Members of the genus \"Ictalurus\", which inhabit muddy waters, do not depend solely on visual cues. Instead, they are known to rely heavily on chemotaxic cues. Sound production may be another important means of communication among channel catfish and other species living in turbid habitats.\n\nThe North American channel catfish is an ostariophysan, or a bony fish occupying a freshwater habitat. These fishes are known to produce club cells and alarm substances for communication purposes. Both the fish's habitat and the presence of chemosensory cells covering the body are presumably the results of favored selection for this method of communication. Catfishes are capable of producing and recognizing individual specific pheromones. Through these pheromones, a catfish can identify not only the species and sex of a conspecific, but also its age, size, reproductive state, or hierarchical social status.\n\nTerritoriality in channel catfish is identifiable by a change in body odor, which is recognizable by other members of the same species. This chemical change in the amino-acid composition of the skin mucus can be noted by chromatographic methods, and are not long-lasting; rather, they last only long enough to communicate to other fish in the vicinity. Changes may be the result of the release of the contents of the club cells. These cells do not open directly to the surface of the skin, but injury caused by fighting and other agonistic behaviors may release the cells’ contents. Since catfish have a dominance hierarchy system, information relative to the change of status of any fish is important in recognition of the social strata.\n\nIn the channel catfish, while a communication signal is directed toward the receiver and contains a specific message, an information signal is a part of the general existence of the individual or the group. For example, release of an alarm signal will communicate danger, but the individual's recognition odor is only an information signal identifying one fish from another. With regards to the function and contents of the club cells, the club cells may serve different functions throughout the fish's lifecycle. Variation in the contents of the club cells’ information signals therefore may change with the species’ needs at different stages of life.\n\nAll species of catfishes can generate sound through stridulation, and many produce sounds through drumming. Stridulation consists of the clicking or grinding of bony parts on the fish's pectoral fins and pectoral girdle, and drumming consists of the contraction of specialized sonic muscles with subsequent reverberation through the swim bladder. Variability in the sound signals created by the channel catfish depends on the mechanism by which the sound is produced, the function of the resultant sound, and physical factors such as sex, age, and temperature. This variation may result in increased complexity of the outgoing signal and may allow for increased usefulness of the signal in interspecies communication. In the channel catfish, sounds are produced only by pectoral stridulation, as this species does not express sonic muscles. However, the swim bladder may still be used to help with audition.\n\nDue to the high density of water, sound travels 4.8 times faster and over longer distances under water than in air. Consequently, sound production via stridulation is an excellent means of underwater communication for channel catfish. The pectoral spine of the channel catfish is an enlarged fin ray with a slightly modified base that forms a complex articulation with several bones of the pectoral girdle. Unlike the other pectoral fin rays, the individual fin segments of the spine are hypertrophied and fused, except for at the distal tip. The surface of the spine is often ornamented with a serrated edge and venomous tissues, designed to deter predators. Sounds produced during fin abduction result from the movement of the base of the pectoral spine across the pectoral girdle channel. Each sweep of sound consists of a number of discrete pulses created by the ridges lining the base of the pectoral spine as they pass over the rough surface of the girdle's channel. The stridulation sounds are extremely variable due to the range and flexibility of motion in fin use. Different sounds may be used for different functions in communication, such as in behavior towards predators and in asserting dominance.\n\nIn many channel catfish, individuals favor one fin or another for stridulatory sound production (in the same way as humans are right-handed or left-handed). The first ray of the channel catfish pectoral fin is a bilaterally symmetrical spinous structure that is minimally important for movement; however, it can be locked as a defensive adaptation or used as a means for sound production. According to one scholar, most fish tend to produce sound with their right fin, although sound production with the left fin has also been observed.\n\nThe inferior division of the inner ear, most prominently the utricle, is considered the primary area of hearing in most fishes. The hearing ability of the channel catfish is enhanced by the presence of the swim bladder. It is the main structure that reverberates the echo from other individuals’ sounds, as well as from sonar devices. The volume of the swim bladder changes if fish move vertically, thus is also considered to be the site of pressure sensitivity. The latency of swim bladder adaptation after a change in pressure affects hearing and other possible swim bladder functions, presumably making audition more difficult. Nevertheless, the presence of the swim bladder and a relatively complex auditory apparatus allows the channel catfish to discern different sounds and tell from which directions sounds have come.\n\nPectoral stridulation has been considered to be the main means of agonistic communication towards predators in channel catfish. Sudden, relatively loud sounds are used to startle predators in a manner analogous to the well-documented, visual flash display of various lepidopterans. In most catfish, a drumming sound can be produced for this use, and the incidences of the drumming sounds can reach up to 300 or 400 per second. However, the channel catfish must resort instead to stridulation sounds and pectoral spine display for predator avoidance. In addition to communication towards predators, stridulation can be seen as a possible alarm signal to other catfish, in the sense of warning nearby individuals that a predator is near.\n\nChannel catfish are omnivores, and can be caught using a variety of natural and prepared baits, including crickets, nightcrawlers, minnows, shad, freshwater drum, crawfish, frogs, bullheads, sunfish, chicken liver, and suckers. Catfish have even been known to take Ivory soap as bait and even raw steak.\n\nJuglines, trotlines, limb lines, and bank lines are popular methods of fishing for channel catfish in addition to traditional rod-and-reel fishing. Another method uses traps, either \"slat traps\" — long wooden traps with an angled entrance — and wire hoop traps. Typical bait for these traps include rotten cheese and dog food, or \"stink bait\", and old rotted shad work well. Catches of as many as 100 fish a day are common in catfish traps. An unusual method practiced in the Southeastern United States is noodling – catching catfish by hand.\n\nWhen removing the hook from a catfish, anglers should be mindful of the sharp spines on the pectoral and dorsal fins.\n\nThe channel catfish is one of only a handful of ostariophysan freshwater fish species whose genomes have been sequenced. The channel catfish reference genome sequence was generated alongside genomic sequence data for other scaled and unscaled fish species (other catfishes, the common pleco and southern striped Raphael; also common carp), in order to provide genomic resources and aid understanding of the evolutionary loss of scales in catfishes. Results from comparative genomics and transcriptomics analyses and experiments involving channel catfish have supported a role for secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins (SCPP) in scale formation in teleost fishes.\n\nIn addition to the whole nuclear genome resources above, full mitochondrial genome sequences have been available for channel catfish since 2003. Other studies of genetic diversity, outcrossing, etc. in channel catfish have focused primarily on inbred lines and farm strains of relevance to the aquaculture of this species. For example, earlier studies have compared the genetic diversity of domestic versus wild populations of channel catfish using AFLPs.\n\n"}

After learning to climb at Tahquitz he went on to make first ascents of many big wall routes in Yosemite. As an early proponent of boltless, pitonless clean climbing, he, along with Yvon Chouinard, was instrumental in changing the climbing culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s by encouraging the use and preservation of the natural features of the rock. He went on to become a well-known kayaker.\n\n\nIn 1971, Robbins completed the second ascent, with Don Lauria, of the Dawn Wall on El Capitan, with the (controversial) intention of erasing the route as they climbed it.\n\nTheir ascent closely followed the 1970 first ascent by Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell, completed with a heavy-handed reliance on bolts - a method that offended Robbins and other clean climbing advocates. Harding had left all his bolts in the rock; Robbins and Lauria used the bolts to repeat the climb; and Robbins then chopped the heads off the bolts behind them. After two pitches, Robbins stopped chopping the bolts because (according to Lauria) \"the quality of the aid climbing was much higher than he had ever expected of Harding or Caldwell and, of course, it was also taking us an awful long time to chop all those goddam bolts.\"\n\nFollowing his success as a climber, Robbins founded an eponymous outdoor apparel company with his wife Liz Robbins. Royal Robbins, LLC In 2018 the company was bought by the Swiss company Fenix Outdoor International AG, WHO also owns brands like Fjällräven, Primus, Brunton, Tierra and Hanwag as well as the European outdoor retailers Globetrotter, Naturkompaniet, Friluftsland and Partioaitta. Liz Robbins rejoined the company in December 2015 as a senior advisor.\n\n\nRobbins authored two seminal books, \"Basic Rockcraft\" and \"Advanced Rockcraft\", which emphasized free climbing skills and a clean-climbing ethic. In a section of \"Advanced Rockcraft\" called \"Values\", he described his climbing philosophy. He believes that \"a first ascent is a creation in the same sense as is a painting or a song\", and that choosing a climbing line may well be \"an act of brilliant creativity\". Another creative aspect of a first ascent involves the aids that the leader of the climb rejects. With modern technology of aid climbing available, a first ascent is more artistic if it consciously rejects the use of certain climbing aids that are not essential to the success of the climb. He places emphasis on using equipment which is non-destructive to the mountain environment. He opposes climbs done outside the accepted mores of a given climbing center, or the prevailing style of an area. He favors what he calls \"upward variations\", or completing a climb using more stringent standards than used on the first ascent. In Robbins' view, the decision to place a single piton is a matter of \"enormous importance\" because \"like a single word in a poem, it can affect the entire composition\".\n\nIn 1978, Robbins developed psoriatic arthritis, which prevented serious climbing. He took up adventure kayaking instead, completing first descents of challenging rivers from high mountain elevations. His early kayaking partners included Doug Tompkins and Reg Lake. In 1980, the three descended the San Joaquin River Gorge from Devil's Postpile to the Mammoth Pool Reservoir, 5000 feet lower and 32 miles away. In 1981, they carried their kayaks over Mount Whitney Pass at 13,777 foot elevation, into Sequoia National Park and descended 55 miles down the Kern Trench. In 1982, joined by Neusom Holmes, they descended the Middle Fork of the Kings River in Kings Canyon National Park, the largest and steepest of these three High Sierra descents. In 1983, Robbins descended the Tuolumne River in Yosemite National Park from Tuolumne Meadows to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. He was accompanied by Reg Lake, Chuck Stanley, Lars Holbek, John Armstrong and Richard Montgomery.\n\nHe then developed an interest in descending smaller mountain creeks by kayak during their flood stage following heavy rains. His first such project in May, 1984 was the descent of Sespe Creek, which runs through the Los Padres National Forest. He was accompanied by Yvon Chouinard, Reg Lake, John Wasserman and Jackson Frischman. Robbins called this type of trip \"flash boating\", and later used the technique on the Fresno River, the Chowchilla River and the middle fork of the Mokelumne River.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1797071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797071", "title": "Sahara Las Vegas", "text": "Sahara Las Vegas\n\nSahara Las Vegas is a hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip in Winchester, Nevada. It is owned and operated by the Meruelo Group. The hotel has 1,600 rooms, and the casino contains . The Sahara anchors the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. It is the site of the northernmost station of the Las Vegas Monorail.\n\nThe resort had initially operated under the Sahara name from 1952 to 2011. Originally, Milton Prell opened the Club Bingo casino on the site in 1947. In 1951, he gathered former business partners to begin work on the Sahara, which was built on the land partially occupied by Club Bingo. Del E. Webb Construction Company built the Sahara, which opened on October 7, 1952, as the sixth resort on the Las Vegas Strip. It featured an African theme. Martin Stern Jr. designed several hotel additions for the Sahara, including a 14-story tower that opened in 1960. The Sahara was sold to Del Webb's hotel division in 1961, and a 24-story hotel tower, also designed by Stern, was opened in 1963. Paul Lowden purchased the Sahara in 1982, and another hotel tower was added in 1988. Lowden sold the Sahara to Bill Bennett in 1995, and Bennett launched a $65 million renovation of the resort that included a Moroccan theme.\n\nSam Nazarian's SBE Entertainment Group, along with Stockbridge Real Estate Group, purchased the Sahara in 2007. The Sahara was closed on May 16, 2011, as it was no longer considered economically viable. In 2013, Nazarian began a $415 million renovation of the resort before reopening it as the SLS Las Vegas on August 23, 2014, as part of SBE's chain of SLS hotels. Nazarian sold his stake to Stockbridge in 2015, and one of the hotel towers was rebranded the following year as W Las Vegas, managed by Starwood as part of its W Hotels chain. The SLS was sold to Meruelo Group in 2018, and the W Las Vegas became part of the SLS again after the resort ended its relationship with Starwood. The SLS was renamed Sahara Las Vegas on August 29, 2019, as part of an ongoing renovation by Meruelo.\n\nBefore the Sahara was built, an earlier casino had operated on the site as Club Bingo. Around 1942, Melvin D. Close (1900–1974) purchased a 19-acre property on what would become the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. Club Bingo owner Milton Prell had previously opened the 30 Club in Butte, Montana. Prell and his family then moved to Las Vegas in 1945, with the intention of opening a small hotel. Remembering how successful his earlier casino club had been, Prell opened the similar Club Bingo in Las Vegas before building a full hotel-casino. Prell opened Club Bingo with Frank Schivo, who previously worked at the 30 Club. Schivo managed Club Bingo's casino.\n\nClub Bingo opened on July 24, 1947, on 4 acres of the 19-acre property, and it quickly became a success. Club Bingo included a 300-seat bingo parlor as well as the Bonanza Room, which provided food and entertainment. Entertainers included singer Dorothy Dandridge and comedian Stan Irwin. Irwin eventually became the entertainment director for Club Bingo. The Club Bingo building was considered basic, with the exception of an electric bingo board sign on top.\n\nPrell briefly considered adding a small hotel and a village of adobe buildings to the Club Bingo property, but he decided against the idea because it did not fit in with his ultimate vision of a luxury hotel. In early 1951, Prell gathered several former business partners to begin work on a hotel project that would become the Sahara. In July 1951, Close announced he had sold the remaining land for $225,000 to the Club Bingo owners. Plans were simultaneously announced for a 200-room hotel project that would be built on the land. The site was considered ideal for the new resort because it was located just outside of city limits, allowing Prell and Winter to avoid paying taxes on slot machines and property. At the time, the project was expected to cost $2 million.\n\nClub Bingo co-owner Al Winter recruited Sam Boyd to be a partner in the new Sahara project. Boyd had previously operated a bingo game for Winter in Oregon. Boyd invested in the Sahara to become an owner and partner. The Sahara was originally set to open in summer 1952, but construction delays pushed back the opening date.\n\nThe $5 million Hotel Sahara opened on October 7, 1952, with an African Sahara theme. Attendees to the grand opening included Ray Bolger and Gus Greenbaum. It was the sixth resort to open on the Las Vegas Strip. It was constructed by Del E. Webb Construction Company. Max Maltzman was the architect, and Ragnar Qvale was the interior designer. The Sahara utilized a modern and simple design. The North African desert theme was conveyed only minimally in the Sahara's architecture. Outside, the only depiction of the theme consisted of fake camels and Arabian people. The interior included statues of Arab guards.\n\nThe Sahara was located on , employed 500 people, and contained 240 hotel rooms. The hotel consisted of two-story motel wings that formed a quadrangle around the pool. Each room included a patio or balcony. Other amenities included a casino, an 85-foot bar, and two restaurants: The Congo Room, which was the primary dining choice; and The Caravan, a coffee shop featuring hand-painted murals. These areas of the resort, as well as the Casbar Theatre, featured African images. Upon realizing that the resort needed more rooms, Prell hired Del Webb to build 200 additional units in 1953. The addition was designed by Martin Stern Jr. as a two-story motel wing, built out in an \"E\"-like shape just south of the quadrangle structures. The addition marked Stern's first project in Las Vegas. Like at Club Bingo, Schivo managed the casino at the Sahara. Schivo's wife, Shirlee, would later help to decorate the hotel's interior during a refurbishment. Irwin also retained his position as entertainment director, responsible for arranging celebrity performances at the Sahara.\n\nThe Sahara included the first Olympic-size swimming pool in Las Vegas, and would become the first hotel to host hydroplane races on Lake Mead. The Sahara Cup hydroplane races were first held in 1956, and continued for several years. The hotel ended its sponsorship of the races in 1959, stating that they had become too big of an event for a single organization to sponsor.\nIn 1959, a $3.5 million construction and remodeling project began at Hotel Sahara, including the start of construction on a 14-story hotel tower. The tower was designed by Stern, and construction was handled by Del E. Webb Construction Company. It was built southeast of the hotel pool. Construction on the tower had reached the eighth floor in November 1959, and the project was topped out in early 1960. Aside from the tower, other new features included a coffee shop with seating for 300 people, and a 700-person convention hall. The 14-story Sahara Tower (later the Tunis Tower) opened in June 1960, adding 204 additional rooms for a total of 604. It was the tallest building in Nevada at the time. A flashing, electric clock was located atop the tower. The clock included the time as well as the temperature, and was topped by a letter \"S\" sign. Also added was a 127-foot vertical roadside sign, designed by YESCO and installed in front of the resort.\n\nBy July 1961, there were plans for a $2.5 million renovation of the Hotel Sahara. Also planned was a 24-story hotel tower, designed by Stern, that would cost $4.5 million. The project would also include a parking garage along the Las Vegas Strip. The Sahara-Nevada Corporation – the hotel division of Del E. Webb Corporation – bought the Sahara in 1961. An expansion of the restaurant and lounge facilities was underway in late 1961, and an enlargement of the Casbar Theater was completed in early 1962. That year, Prell and other Sahara executives sought to rename the adjacent San Francisco Avenue as Sahara Avenue. Beldon Katleman, owner of the former El Rancho Vegas across the street, objected to the proposal, stating that the road should be renamed after his hotel-casino property. Despite the opposition, the street was renamed after the Sahara.\nA groundbreaking ceremony was held on February 9, 1962, for the $6 million, 24-story Sahara Skyscraper hotel tower, located next to the Sahara Tower. The new tower, built by Del Webb, was expected to measure 260 feet in height. It would add 400 rooms, for a total of 1,000. Three swimming pools, including the original Olympic pool, opened in April 1962, after construction and remodeling. By October 1962, construction on the new tower had reached its 17th floor. In early 1963, several new facilities were opened in a three-story building as part of a $12 million expansion. These facilities included the Caravan Room coffee shop, the House of Lords steakhouse, a Don the Beachcomber restaurant, and a 1,000-seat convention hall. Temporary walls had been put up to shield casino customers from construction of the new facilities.\n\nThe 24-story hotel addition, eventually known as the Alexandria Tower, was opened later in 1963. The clock and \"S\" sign were relocated from the original tower to the new tower. In 1964, the Sahara paid $25,000 to have the Beatles perform in Las Vegas and stay at the resort, although their performance took place at the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center, as the Sahara's 600-seat showroom could not handle the crowd size of a Beatles concert. The Sahara would later display photos of the Beatles' visit to the resort.\n\nIn 1967, there were plans to add a $3 million, two-story convention facility to the Sahara. In July 1968, the hotel was nearing completion on the facility, known as the Sahara Space Center. The facility opened in September 1968, and hosted U.S. vice presidential candidate Spiro Agnew for a speech. The Sahara Space Center included seating for up to 5,000 people.\n\nA rooftop fire occurred at the Sahara in August 1964, causing nearly $1 million in damage. A work crew had been on the roof installing a sprinkler system, and the fire was believed to have been caused by a smoldering rag. Firefighters put it out with thousands of gallons of water, which soaked through the main casino area's ceiling and also flooded the main showroom. Las Vegas sheriff Ralph Lamb believed the fire to be more financially destructive than the one which destroyed the El Rancho Vegas, stating that it was \"probably the biggest hotel fire we've ever had in Las Vegas.\" Some gamblers had been hesitant to quit playing and evacuate the casino.\n\nApproximately 100 workmen began repairs immediately following the fire, and most of the affected facilities reopened the day after. For its reopening, the Sahara sign advertised, \"Visit The Hottest Casino In Town.\" Casino operations were moved to a recently completed casino addition, adjacent to the main casino, that was unharmed by the fire. Full repair work was expected to take 30 days.\n\nIn May 1967, three men were arrested after planting a homemade bomb in a Sahara hotel room on the 12th floor, part of a failed extortion attempt. A note was left demanding $75,000 for information to disarm the bomb. The note also warned that bombs had been placed in two other hotels owned by Del Webb. Seven hotels in three states were evacuated, but no other bombs were found.\n\nIn July 1968, a fire started on the roof of the casino building, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of people. A crew had been working on a rooftop air conditioning unit, and the fire was believed to have started from a spark created by welding equipment. The fire caused an estimated $1 million in damage to the main casino area, the hotel's executive offices, the coffee shop, a lounge, and the showroom. The fire was stopped before it could damage a new casino addition, which had been in operation for several months and was located north of the main casino. The hotel portion was also unaffected by the fire, and its guests were not evacuated. Most of the affected facilities were expected to be quickly repaired and reopened the next day after the fire.\n\nIn July 1981, a fire started in a third-floor hotel room and smoke poured through the upper floors, prompting the evacuation of more than 200 guests. The cause of the fire was considered suspicious.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Sahara began declining in popularity, especially as newer, bigger resorts opened in Las Vegas in later years, such as The Mirage and MGM Grand. In the late 1970s, the Sahara was among several casinos involved in a scam pulled off by gamblers. As a result, the Sahara faced a $37,500 fine by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which alleged that the resort had violated casino procedures.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Del Webb began plans to expand the resort and its parking. In 1978, the company purchased 25 acres at the southeast corner of Paradise Road and Sahara Avenue, directly east of the resort, and turned it into a parking lot for customers. A pedestrian bridge was also built over Paradise Road, allowing for direct access to the Sahara. The parking lot was once the site of Las Vegas' first airport, Anderson Field, during the 1920s.\n\nIn 1981, Del E. Webb Corporation announced that it would have to sell the Sahara to reduce its debt. Paul W. Lowden, who owned the Hacienda hotel-casino, purchased the 932-room Sahara for $50 million in 1982. With the purchase, Lowden owned the southernmost and the northernmost casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. At the time, the Sahara had 2,500 employees, five of whom had been working there since its opening in 1952. Following a two-week investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 1982, a Sahara blackjack dealer and seven card players were indicted for taking part in a cheating scheme at the casino.\n\nLowden formed a master limited partnership to raise money for a refurbishment of the resort and to finance the construction of a 575-room hotel tower. In 1988, the 27-story Tangiers Tower was added to the property. An expansion to the Tangiers Tower was added in 1991.\nIn June 1995, Lowden's Sahara Gaming Corporation announced that gaming executive Bill Bennett had agreed to buy the Sahara as part of a $150 million deal. The agreement included the Wet 'n Wild water park located south of the resort. Bennett completed his purchase later that year, at a cost of $193 million. A $65 million renovation began in March 1996, and was aimed at attracting midlevel gamblers. A Moroccan theme would be applied throughout the resort, including the 1,750 hotel rooms. Casino space would be tripled to , and would include an additional 1,300 slot machines, as well as a new sportsbook. Two new restaurants would also be added, along with an 850-seat buffet. The renovation was funded entirely by Bennett and his company. The start of the renovation project was marked by the demolition of poolside bungalows that had housed various celebrities, including Ann-Margret, George Burns, and Tony Bennett. The renovation was scheduled for completion in January 1997, at which point a second phase of remodeling was scheduled to begin. The second phase was intended to add 1,300 rooms, for a total of more than 3,000.\n\nThe resort's main entrance was relocated from the north side of the property to a new southwest entrance on the Las Vegas Strip. The casino was increased to , with expansion into the southeast area of the property, bringing the gaming closer to the hotel and the newly relocated pool area. The buffet was relocated to the second floor of the north side of the casino. Chandeliers were placed throughout the resort. A $4.6 million porte-cochère was added, consisting of an expansive overhead Moroccan-style dome, measuring 140 feet high and 200 feet in diameter. Fountains and palm trees surrounded the hotel's circular entryway. A seven-story parking garage with 2,000 spaces was added as well. A new sign, featuring two neon camels, was added along the Las Vegas Strip in the 1990s.\nIn 2000, a roller coaster and a NASCAR restaurant were added, along with a video game arcade. The roller coaster, named \"Speed – The Ride\" and located in front of the Sahara, shot riders along the Las Vegas Strip, where it looped through the grandiose Sahara sign, went straight up a tower, stopped and then took a return trip backwards. Bergman Walls Associates were the 1999 architects.\n\nThe Sahara began appealing to middle-class customers under Bennett's ownership, offering dollar specials to stay competitive against newer resorts. Eugene Moehring, a history professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, stated that the Sahara's decline began as early as 1966, when Caesars Palace opened on the Las Vegas Strip, taking many of the Sahara's high rollers. According to Moehring, the Sahara \"helped establish Las Vegas as a major resort city after World War II. But its contributions to Las Vegas shifted as the years went by. By the early 1970s it was getting to be old. One problem is that it just didn't have the money to keep up with the times.\" Moehring stated that Bennett's idea of combining \"Arabs with NASCAR\" was a desperate move that ultimately did not work, and that the Sahara had mainly attracted low rollers since the 1990s.\n\nA modest celebration was held in October 2002, marking the resort's 50th anniversary. By that time, the capacity for the Congo Room theater had been reduced from 1,000 people to 850, and dinner was no longer served with the show. Bennett died in December 2002. Rumors of the Sahara's closure surfaced in the media in February 2006. By June, the Sahara site was reportedly up for sale.\n\nIn March 2007, Sam Nazarian's SBE Entertainment Group, along with Stockbridge Real Estate Group, agreed to purchase the Sahara from the Bennett family for an estimated $300 to $400 million. The casino was operated by Navegante Management Group, while SBE managed the hotel and restaurants. In December 2009, the Sahara closed its buffet and two of its hotel towers due to weak demand during the holiday season. In 2010, Nazarian was in negotiations with lenders to restructure the Sahara's debt, ultimately reaching a forbearance agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland Group, the primary lender.\n\nOn March 11, 2011, it was announced that the Sahara would close in two months. At the time, the Sahara had 1,720 hotel rooms and of casino space. The resort featured two primary restaurants at the time: House of Lords steakhouse, and the NASCAR Café. The Sahara had 1,050 employees who would be affected by the closure. SBE intended to help find new jobs for Sahara employees at MGM Resorts' properties. Hotel customers with reservations following the planned closing date would also be transferred to MGM Resorts' properties.\n\nAt the time of the closing announcement, Nazarian, the CEO of SBE, said, \"We are working with our partners to assess a variety of options for the property, including a complete renovation and repositioning. While no final decisions have been made at this point, the continued operation of the aging Sahara was no longer economically viable.\" Jerry Lewis, once a performer at the Sahara, said, \"We are losing what was considered by most of us Las Vegans as one of the trademarks of the city.\"\n\nSpeed – The Ride closed on May 1, 2011. The ride was sold and removed. It was planned to be relocated across from the Mandalay Bay in the plaza that was to be called Akita Plaza. As of 2019, the ride continues to sit in storage and has not been rebuilt.\n\nThe sports book and Sahara Theater closed later in May 2011. The resort's hotel and casino closed at 2:00 p.m. on May 16, 2011, marking the end of the Sahara's 58-year operation. National Content Liquidators began a two-month liquidation sale at the Sahara in June 2011, with more than 600,000 items available for sale on the first day. Among the items for sale were the Sahara camel statues, priced at $12,000 each. The contents of the NASCAR Café were excluded from the sale. The sale concluded in September 2011, and attracted thousands of people over the course of its run. It was the largest liquidation sale in Las Vegas history. Items that did not sell were donated. In September 2011, plans to redevelop the property were accelerated.\n\nOn February 14, 2013, Nazarian announced the groundbreaking for the $415 million conversion of the hotel into the SLS Las Vegas. The following month, the Sahara's camel sign on the Las Vegas Strip was dismantled.\nSLS Las Vegas opened on August 23, 2014. It contained 1,600 rooms, a casino, four nightclubs, the clothing store Fred Segal and various restaurants. Originally, the name \"SLS\", a chain of hotels, was chosen because the letters sounded good together. Later, it was stated it could stand for whatever you want it to. It has also been stated the name \"SLS\" was chosen by Nazarian to denote \"style, luxury and service\". Nazarian has also said the letters came to him when he pulled up behind a Mercedes SL500, and thought the '5' looked like an 'S'.\n\nThe guest rooms and restaurants were designed by Philippe Starck in collaboration with Gensler. Additionally, a handful of suites are designed by musician and actor Lenny Kravitz. Nazarian, a developer of nightclubs, had the casino floor redesigned for a darker appearance resembling a nightclub, with a high ceiling and exposed ductwork. In one hotel tower, the rooms were updated to feature a basic design with gray walls and exposed concrete ceilings.\n\nA 32-foot-tall abstract statue, known as \"Sam by Starck\", was designed by Starck and placed in front of the SLS, as a homage to Nazarian. The statue, resembling a silver starfish, was compared by some observers to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and the Pillsbury Doughboy. The statue, which used an internal steel frame, was constructed on-site and in pieces. A 12-foot metal duck statue, also by Starck, was added to the hotel's pool area. The duck statue is filled with Styrofoam and was glued in place.\n\nOn September 6, 2014, Hilton Worldwide added the SLS to its specialty Curio brand. The facility offered of event space, 9 dining establishments, an open air rooftop pool/nightclub, and the Ciel Spa.\n\nOn October 6, 2015, Sam Nazarian sold his interest in the SLS Las Vegas and made an agreement to franchise the hotel to Stockbridge Real Estate Group.\n\nOn November 9, 2015, Starwood Hotels & Resorts announced that it would add SLS Las Vegas to its Tribute Portfolio, a chain of independent four-star hotels that would allow it to take advantage of Starwood's reservation platform and member benefits. It also announced that the 289-room LUX Tower, one of the three towers onsite, would undergo a renovation and rebranding as W Las Vegas in September 2016. The W would have its own dedicated entrance, lobby, meeting space, pool and facilities and will be managed by Starwood while the remainder of the SLS would remain under its existing management. The conversion to the W was officially completed on December 1, 2016.\n\nIn April 2018, the Meruelo Group purchased the SLS from Stockbridge. Alex Meruelo announced plans for $100 million of renovations to the property, and was also expected to rebrand the SLS in 2019. Observers speculated that the resort would revive the Sahara name, and renovation plans used a \"working name\" of \"Grand Sahara Resort\", mirroring the name of Meruelo's Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada. Meruelo planned to redesign the casino floor, which he considered too dark. The previously renovated hotel tower would be updated again to remove its basic design in favor of a more conventional appearance. Paul Hobson was hired as general manager and would oversee the renovations. Meruelo considered the Hispanic clientele in Las Vegas underserved, and stated that it would be among the target demographics for the resort under his ownership.\n\nIn August 2018, the SLS ended its relationship with Starwood, and the W Las Vegas was renamed as the Grand Tower and brought back under in-house management.\n\nAn enormous ceremony involving fireworks and a light show was held on June 27, 2019 to announce an upcoming name change to Sahara Las Vegas, as part of the ongoing renovation. The resort would continue to operate under the SLS name for several months until the Sahara name was fully implemented throughout the resort. The process to replace the SLS branding, including exterior signage, was expected to conclude in September or October 2019, at which point the resort would be marketed under the Sahara name.\n\nOn the night of August 27, 2019, the Sam by Starck statue was removed during a ceremony and subsequently disposed, as part of the Sahara rebranding. The ceremony began with flames that were set off at the base of the statue, followed by a fireworks show. A crane subsequently tore the statue down. Palm trees are expected to take the place of the former statue. Because of the way that the statue was constructed, a company spokesman stated that it would be nearly impossible to disassemble the statue and restore it elsewhere for display. The pool area's duck statue is expected to be relocated to the pool at the Grand Sierra Resort.\n\nThe resort became Sahara Las Vegas on August 29, 2019, and renovations are expected to continue into 2020. A renovation of the pool area was scheduled to begin in September 2019. The Sahara's new lounge was named Casbar Lounge, after the resort's original live-music venue. The new Sahara is modern in its design and does not feature a Moroccan theme as before, although it features references to the original Sahara. Hobson said, \"You might see some camels in artwork around the property, but nothing in terms of a theme. There will be reference to the original Sahara era that reflects what we want for the modern era. There's some nostalgia, but we are defining it for today.\" A poker room opened in February 2020, as part of the renovation project. Poker had been absent from the casino for nearly a decade.\n\nPerformers at the resort over the years have included Tony Bennett, Sonny & Cher, Johnny Carson, Buddy Hackett, Don Rickles, Liberace, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, George Burns, and Sammy Davis Jr. Other performers included Bobby Darin, Red Skelton, Ann Blyth, Martha Raye, Donald O'Connor, Kathryn Grayson, Mae West, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, Lena Horne, Jack Benny, Paul Anka, George Carlin, Liza Minnelli, Barbra Streisand, Wayne Newton, Bill Cosby, Ann-Margret, Louis Prima, Joey Bishop, Shelley Berman, The Drifters, The Coasters, and drag queen Kenny Kerr.\n\nIn 1953, singer Marlene Dietrich was paid $90,000 to give performances for three weeks at the Sahara. A $200,000 contract was later announced that would have Dietrich perform in two separate engagements at the hotel, each spanning four weeks. The Sahara subsequently took credit for pioneering the concept of high-priced acts, citing Dietrich's initial performances there in 1953.\n\nIn late 1954, entertainment director Bill Miller hired jazz musician Louis Prima to be their late night lounge act, one of the earliest ones on the Las Vegas Strip. Along with his then-wife Keely Smith and sax player Sam Butera, they created one of the hottest late-night attractions on the Strip. In 1956, Abbott and Costello appeared together for the last time on the Sahara stage before their permanent breakup. Judy Garland performed at the resort in 1962. The resort was the site of the annual Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon for many years, first from 1973 to 1981 and again from 1991 to 1994. Jerry Lewis himself also performed at the resort. The Sahara Space Center hosted events such as boxing matches, and the Jerry Lewis telethon. It also hosted the bands Kiss and Rush in 1975.\n\nIn 2000, a magic show by Steve Wyrick launched at the Sahara. Charo, who made her headliner debut at the Sahara two decades earlier, started a concert show at the resort in 2002. While the resort was known as SLS Las Vegas, it featured two entertainment venues: Life Nightclub and Sayers Club; the latter included comedy shows. Life Nightclub was later renamed The Foundry. \"Blanc de Blanc\", a cabaret-style variety show, debuted at The Foundry in August 2019, and ended in November. Another show, \"Magic Mike Live\", is scheduled to open in 2020.\n\n\n"}

Modern scholarship identifies three major stages in monumental sculpture in bronze and stone: the Archaic (from about 650 to 480 BC), Classical (480-323) and Hellenistic. At all periods there were great numbers of Greek terracotta figurines and small sculptures in metal and other materials.\n\nThe Greeks decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavour. Seeing their gods as having human form, there was little distinction between the sacred and the secular in art—the human body was both secular and sacred. A male nude of Apollo or Heracles had only slight differences in treatment to one of that year's Olympic boxing champion. The statue, originally single but by the Hellenistic period often in groups was the dominant form, though reliefs, often so \"high\" that they were almost free-standing, were also important.\n\nBy the classical period, roughly the 5th and 4th centuries, monumental sculpture was composed almost entirely of marble or bronze; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century; many pieces of sculpture known only in marble copies made for the Roman market were originally made in bronze. Smaller works were in a great variety of materials, many of them precious, with a very large production of terracotta figurines. The territories of ancient Greece, except for Sicily and southern Italy, contained abundant supplies of fine marble, with Pentelic and Parian marble the most highly prized. The ores for bronze were also relatively easy to obtain.\nBoth marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable; as in most ancient cultures there were no doubt also traditions of sculpture in wood about which we know very little, other than acrolithic sculptures, usually large, with the head and exposed flesh parts in marble but the clothed parts in wood. As bronze always had a significant scrap value very few original bronzes have survived, though in recent years marine archaeology or trawling has added a few spectacular finds, such as the Artemision Bronze and Riace bronzes, which have significantly extended modern understanding. Many copies of the Roman period are marble versions of works originally in bronze. Ordinary limestone was used in the Archaic period, but thereafter, except in areas of modern Italy with no local marble, only for architectural sculpture and decoration. Plaster or stucco was sometimes used for the hair only.\n\nChryselephantine sculptures, used for temple cult images and luxury works, used gold, most often in leaf form and ivory for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived. Many statues were given jewellery, as can be seen from the holes for attaching it, and held weapons or other objects in different materials.\nAncient Greek sculptures were originally painted bright colors; they only appear white today because the original pigments have deteriorated. References to painted sculptures are found throughout classical literature, including in Euripides's \"Helen\" in which the eponymous character laments, \"If only I could shed my beauty and assume an uglier aspect/The way you would wipe color off a statue.\" Some well-preserved statues still bear traces of their original coloration and archaeologists can reconstruct what they would have originally looked like.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces, some of which were still visible. Despite this, influential art historians such as Johann Joachim Winckelmann so strongly opposed the idea of painted Greek sculpture that proponents of painted statues were dismissed as eccentrics, and their views were largely dismissed for more than a century.\n\nIt was not until published findings by German archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann in the late 20th and early 21st century that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact. Using high-intensity lamps, ultraviolet light, specially designed cameras, plaster casts, and certain powdered minerals, Brinkmann proved that the entire Parthenon, including the actual structure as well as the statues, had been painted. He analyzed the pigments of the original paint to discover their composition.\n\nBrinkmann made several painted replicas of Greek statues that went on tour around the world. Also in the collection were replicas of other works of Greek and Roman sculpture, and he demonstrated that the practice of painting sculpture was the norm rather than the exception in Greek and Roman art. Museums that hosted the exhibit included the Glyptothek Museum in Munich, the Vatican Museum, and the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, et al. The collection made its American debut at Harvard University in the Fall of 2007.\n\nBrinkmann said that \"no other aspect of the art of antiquity is as little understood as is the polychrome painting of temples and sculptures\", and that modern sculptures, ostensibly inspired by the Greeks but left unpainted, are \"something entirely new\".\n\nIt is commonly thought that the earliest incarnation of Greek sculpture was in the form of wooden cult statues, first described by Pausanias as xoana. No such statues survive, and the descriptions of them are vague, despite the fact that they were probably objects of veneration for hundreds of years. The first piece of Greek statuary to be reassembled since is probably the Lefkandi Centaur, a terra cotta sculpture found on the island of Euboea, dated c. 920 BC. The statue was constructed in parts, before being dismembered and buried in two separate graves. The centaur has an intentional mark on its knee, which has led researchers to postulate that the statue might portray Cheiron, presumably kneeling wounded from Herakles' arrow. If so, it would be the earliest known depiction of myth in the history of Greek sculpture.\n\nThe forms from the geometrical period (c. 900 to c. 700 BC) were chiefly terra cotta figurines, bronzes, and ivories. The bronzes are chiefly tripod cauldrons, and freestanding figures or groups. Such bronzes were made using the lost-wax technique probably introduced from Syria, and are almost entirely votive offerings left at the Hellenistic civilization Panhellenic sanctuaries of Olympia, Delos, and Delphi, though these were likely manufactured elsewhere, as a number of local styles may be identified by finds from Athens, Argos, and Sparta. Typical works of the era include the Karditsa warrior (Athens Br. 12831) and the many examples of the equestrian statuette (for example, NY Met. 21.88.24 online). The repertory of this bronze work is not confined to standing men and horses, however, as vase paintings of the time also depict imagery of stags, birds, beetles, hares, griffins and lions. There are no inscriptions on early-to-middle geometric sculpture, until the appearance of the Mantiklos \"Apollo\" (Boston 03.997) of the early 7th century BC found in Thebes. The figure is that of a standing man with a pseudo-daedalic form, underneath which lies the hexameter inscription reading \"Mantiklos offered me as a tithe to Apollo of the silver bow; do you, Phoibos [Apollo], give some pleasing favour in return\". Apart from the novelty of recording its own purpose, this sculpture adapts the formulae of oriental bronzes, as seen in the shorter more triangular face and slightly advancing left leg. This is sometimes seen as anticipating the greater expressive freedom of the 7th century BC and, as such, the Mantiklos figure is referred to in some quarters as proto-Daedalic.\n\nInspired by the monumental stone sculpture of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Greeks began again to carve in stone. Free-standing figures share the solidity and frontal stance characteristic of Eastern models, but their forms are more dynamic than those of Egyptian sculpture, as for example the Lady of Auxerre and Torso of Hera (Early Archaic period, c. 660–580 BC, both in the Louvre, Paris). After about 575 BC, figures such as these, both male and female, began wearing the so-called archaic smile. This expression, which has no specific appropriateness to the person or situation depicted, may have been a device to give the figures a distinctive human characteristic.\n\nThree types of figures prevailed—the standing nude male youth (kouros, plural kouroi), the standing draped girl (kore, plural korai), and the seated woman. All emphasize and generalize the essential features of the human figure and show an increasingly accurate comprehension of human anatomy. The youths were either sepulchral or votive statues. Examples are Apollo (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), an early work; the Strangford Apollo from Anafi (British Museum, London), a much later work; and the Anavyssos Kouros (National Archaeological Museum of Athens). More of the musculature and skeletal structure is visible in this statue than in earlier works. The standing, draped girls have a wide range of expression, as in the sculptures in the Acropolis Museum of Athens. Their drapery is carved and painted with the delicacy and meticulousness common in the details of sculpture of this period.\n\nThe Greeks thus decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavour. Seeing their gods as having human form, there was no distinction between the sacred and the secular in art—the human body was both secular and sacred. A male nude without any attachments such as a bow or a club, could just as easily be Apollo or Heracles as that year's Olympic boxing champion. In the Archaic Period the most important sculptural form was the kouros (plural \"kouroi\"), the standing male nude (See for example Biton and Kleobis). The kore (plural \"korai\"), or standing clothed female figure, was also common; Greek art did not present female nudity (unless the intention was pornographic) until the 4th century BC, although the development of techniques to represent drapery is obviously important.\n\nAs with pottery, the Greeks did not produce sculpture merely for artistic display. Statues were commissioned either by aristocratic individuals or by the state, and used for public memorials, as offerings to temples, oracles and sanctuaries (as is frequently shown by inscriptions on the statues), or as markers for graves. Statues in the Archaic period were not all intended to represent specific individuals. They were depictions of an ideal—beauty, piety, honor or sacrifice. These were always depictions of young men, ranging in age from adolescence to early maturity, even when placed on the graves of (presumably) elderly citizens. \"Kouroi\" were all stylistically similar. Graduations in the social stature of the person commissioning the statue were indicated by size rather than artistic innovations.\n\nThe Classical period saw a revolution of Greek sculpture, sometimes associated by historians with the popular culture surrounding the introduction of democracy and the end of the aristocratic culture associated with the \"kouroi\". The Classical period saw changes in the style and function of sculpture, along with a dramatic increase in the technical skill of Greek sculptors in depicting realistic human forms. Poses also became more naturalistic, notably during the beginning of the period. This is embodied in works such as the \"Kritios Boy\" (480 BC), sculpted with the earliest known use of \"contrapposto\" ('counterpose'), and the \"Charioteer of Delphi\" (474 BC), which demonstrates a transition to more naturalistic sculpture. From about 500 BC, Greek statues began increasingly to depict real people, as opposed to vague interpretations of myth or entirely fictional votive statues, although the style in which they were represented had not yet developed into a realistic form of portraiture. The statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, set up in Athens mark the overthrow of the aristocratic tyranny, and have been said to be the first public monuments to show actual individuals.\n\nThe Classical Period also saw an increase in the use of statues and sculptures as decorations of buildings. The characteristic temples of the Classical era, such as the Parthenon in Athens, and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, used relief sculpture for decorative friezes, and sculpture in the round to fill the triangular fields of the pediments. The difficult aesthetic and technical challenge stimulated much in the way of sculptural innovation. Most of these works survive only in fragments, for example the Parthenon Marbles, roughly half of which are in the British Museum.\n\nFuneral statuary evolved during this period from the rigid and impersonal kouros of the Archaic period to the highly personal family groups of the Classical period. These monuments are commonly found in the suburbs of Athens, which in ancient times were cemeteries on the outskirts of the city. Although some of them depict \"ideal\" types—the mourning mother, the dutiful son—they increasingly depicted real people, typically showing the departed taking his dignified leave from his family. This is a notable increase in the level of emotion relative to the Archaic and Geometrical eras.\n\nAnother notable change is the burgeoning of artistic credit in sculpture. The entirety of information known about sculpture in the Archaic and Geometrical periods are centered upon the works themselves, and seldom, if ever, on the sculptors. Examples include Phidias, known to have overseen the design and building of the Parthenon, and Praxiteles, whose nude female sculptures were the first to be considered artistically respectable. Praxiteles' Aphrodite of Knidos, which survives in copies, was often referenced to and praised by Pliny the Elder.\n\nLysistratus is said to have been the first to use plaster molds taken from living people to produce lost-wax portraits, and to have also developed a technique of casting from existing statues. He came from a family of sculptors and his brother, Lysippos of Sicyon, produced fifteen hundred statues in his career.\n\nThe Statue of Zeus at Olympia and the Statue of Athena Parthenos (both chryselephantine and executed by Phidias or under his direction, and considered to be the greatest of the Classical Sculptures), are lost, although smaller copies (in other materials) and good descriptions of both still exist. Their size and magnificence prompted rivals to seize them in the Byzantine period, and both were removed to Constantinople, where they were later destroyed.\n\nThe transition from the Classical to the Hellenistic period occurred during the 4th century BC. Greek art became increasingly diverse, influenced by the cultures of the peoples drawn into the Greek orbit, by the conquests of Alexander the Great (336 to 323 BC). In the view of some art historians, this is described as a decline in quality and originality; however, individuals of the time may not have shared this outlook. Many sculptures previously considered classical masterpieces are now known to be of the Hellenistic age. The technical ability of the Hellenistic sculptors are clearly in evidence in such major works as the Winged Victory of Samothrace, and the Pergamon Altar. New centres of Greek culture, particularly in sculpture, developed in Alexandria, Antioch, Pergamum, and other cities. By the 2nd century BC, the rising power of Rome had also absorbed much of the Greek tradition—and an increasing proportion of its products as well.\n\nDuring this period, sculpture again experienced a shift towards increasing naturalism. Common people, women, children, animals, and domestic scenes became acceptable subjects for sculpture, which was commissioned by wealthy families for the adornment of their homes and gardens. Realistic figures of men and women of all ages were produced, and sculptors no longer felt obliged to depict people as ideals of beauty or physical perfection. At the same time, new Hellenistic cities springing up in Egypt, Syria, and Anatolia required statues depicting the gods and heroes of Greece for their temples and public places. This made sculpture, like pottery, an industry, with the consequent standardisation and (some) lowering of quality. For these reasons, quite a few more Hellenistic statues survive to the present than those of the Classical period.\n\nAlongside the natural shift towards naturalism, there was a shift in expression of the sculptures as well. Sculptures began expressing more power and energy during this time period. An easy way to see the shift in expressions during the Hellenistic period would be to compare it to the sculptures of the Classical period. The classical period had sculptures such as the Charioteer of Delphi expressing humility. The sculptures of the Hellenistic period however saw greater expressions of power and energy as demonstrated in the Jockey of Artemision.\n\nSome of the best known Hellenistic sculptures are the Winged Victory of Samothrace (2nd or 1st century BC), the statue of Aphrodite from the island of Melos known as the Venus de Milo (mid-2nd century BC), the Dying Gaul (about 230 BC), and the monumental group Laocoön and His Sons (late 1st century BC). All these statues depict Classical themes, but their treatment is far more sensuous and emotional than the austere taste of the Classical period would have allowed or its technical skills permitted. Hellenistic sculpture was also marked by an increase in scale, which culminated in the Colossus of Rhodes (late 3rd century), thought to have been roughly the same size as the Statue of Liberty. The combined effect of earthquakes and looting have destroyed this as well as any other very large works of this period that might have existed.\n\nFollowing the conquests of Alexander the Great, Greek culture spread as far as India, as revealed by the excavations of Ai-Khanoum in eastern Afghanistan, and the civilization of the Greco-Bactrians and the Indo-Greeks. Greco-Buddhist art represented a syncretism between Greek art and the visual expression of Buddhism. Discoveries made since the end of the 19th century surrounding the (now submerged) ancient Egyptian city of Heracleum include a 4th-century BC depiction of Isis. The depiction is unusually sensual for depictions of the Egyptian goddess, as well as being uncharacteristically detailed and feminine, marking a combination of Egyptian and Hellenistic forms around the time of Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt.\n\nIn Goa, India, were found Buddha statues in Greek styles. These are attributed to Greek converts to Buddhism, many of whom are known to have settled in Goa during Hellenistic times.\n\nAll ancient Greek temples and Roman temples normally contained a cult image in the cella. Access to the cella varied, but apart from the priests, at the least some of the general worshippers could access the cella some of the time, though sacrifices to the deity were normally made on altars outside in the temple precinct (tenemos in Greek). Some cult images were easy to see, and were what we would call major tourist attractions. The image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, originally less than life-size, then typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size, in marble or bronze, or in the specially prestigious form of a Chryselephantine statue using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework. The most famous Greek cult images were of this type, including the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, and Phidias's Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon in Athens, both colossal statues now completely lost. Fragments of two chryselephantine statues from Delphi have been excavated. Cult images generally held or wore identifying attributes, which is one way of distinguishing them from the many other statues of deities in temples and other locations.\n\nThe acrolith was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body. A xoanon was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu lingam; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity. Many of the Greek statues well known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the Apollo Barberini, can be credibly identified. A very few actual originals survive, for example the bronze Piraeus Athena (2.35 metres high, including a helmet).\n\nIn Greek and Roman mythology, a \"palladium\" was an image of great antiquity on which the safety of a city was said to depend, especially the wooden one that Odysseus and Diomedes stole from the citadel of Troy and which was later taken to Rome by Aeneas. (The Roman story was related in Virgil's \"Aeneid\" and other works.)\n\n\n\n\n"}

O'Farrell played as a wing half for Cork United, West Ham United and Preston North End. He made over 300 appearances in the Football League before joining Weymouth as player-manager. He went on to manage Torquay United (three stints), Leicester City, Manchester United, Cardiff City, Iran and Al-Shaab. He played for the Republic of Ireland national team, making nine appearances between 1952 and 1959.\n\nBorn in Lower Dublin Hill in Blackpool, a suburb of Cork, O'Farrell lived on Friars Road, in the Turners Cross area of the city. His grand-uncle was renowned bowls player John \"Buck\" McGrath. He was raised a Catholic and attended Christ the King. He played Gaelic football and captained the school team to its first trophy win in 1941. He also played the association code for local teams Nicholas Rovers, Clapton Celtic and at Western Rovers alongside the brother of Noel Cantwell, with whom he would later reunite as a teammate at West Ham United. At the age of 16, he started working on the railways and wanted to be a train driver, like his father. He worked as a fireman on the Dublin–Cork railway line.\n\nA left half, O'Farrell started his playing career with League of Ireland club Cork United, replacing Tommy Moroney in the first team after his departure to West Ham United in 1947. Playing as a semi-professional, he supplemented his earnings with his work on the railways, earning £3 a week for each. In January 1948, after being spotted by West Ham scout Ben Ives, O'Farrell followed Moroney to the Upton Park club for a fee of £3,000. O'Farrell himself received a £1,000 fee for the transfer. He made over 50 appearances for the reserves before breaking into the first team. His debut came on 28 September 1950 in a 2–0 defeat of Colchester United in the Essex Professional Cup. His Football League debut followed in November 1950 in a 4–1 defeat away to Notts County. He made 18 league appearances in his first season but became a regular in the 1951–52 and 1952–53 seasons. He was one of a number of West Ham players that would meet at Cassettari's Café to discuss tactics. He played for West Ham in seven seasons and made 213 appearances, scoring eight goals.\n\nIn November 1956, O'Farrell left for Preston North End in a straight swap deal involving Eddie Lewis. Replacing Ray Evans in the team, he scored on his home debut, a 20-yard strike against Manchester City. Playing alongside Tom Finney, he played 17 league matches before his first loss with the club. He would then miss over a month of football after treatment for a nosebleed which caused him to lose around four pints of blood (he experienced a recurrence of the problem in the following season). His first season with Preston brought a third-place finish and he was still with the Lancashire club when they finished runners-up to Wolverhampton Wanderers in Division One at the end of the 1957–58 season. In the same season O'Farrell's former teammates at West Ham finished as Second Division champions, securing their promotion to the First Division, which he had strived to help achieve. In all, O'Farrell made 129 appearances for Preston, scoring four goals.\n\nHe retired from professional football in 1961, close to 34 years of age, after a second operation to remove cartilage.\n\nO'Farrell won the first of nine full international caps for Ireland against Austria in Vienna on 7 May 1952, in a 6–0 defeat. In his next international game, also against Austria, O'Farrell scored the first of his two international goals as Ireland won 4–0 at Dalymount Park, Dublin. His next game saw his second and last international goal, as Ireland lost 5–3 to France in a qualifying game for the 1954 World Cup. He played infrequently over the next six years before making his ninth and last international appearance on 10 May 1959 in a 4–0 defeat by Czechoslovakia at Tehelne Pole Stadion in Bratislava.\n\nOn 20 June 1961, O'Farrell became player-manager at Southern League team Weymouth. He was paid £25 a week for the role, which was £5 more than he had been earning as a Football League player at Preston. In 1961–62, he oversaw Weymouth's passage to the fourth round of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by his old club Preston North End. After a runners-up spot in 1963–64, he led the club to their first Southern League championship in 1964–65, also reaching the final of the Southern League Cup that season.\n\nIn May 1965, he became manager of Torquay United, replacing Eric Webber. He took the Gulls to promotion in his first season in charge and followed this with seventh- and fourth-place finishes in the Third Division in the following two seasons. While Torquay manager he returned to West Ham to sign a number of players, including John Bond, Ken Brown and Bill Kitchener.\n\nIn December 1968, O'Farrell took over Leicester City. He appointed former West Ham teammate Malcolm Musgrove as his assistant. Leicester were near the bottom of the First Division table when he was appointed and were relegated at the end of the season, but O'Farrell led them to the 1969 FA Cup Final, which they lost 1–0 to Manchester City. The following season brought a third-place finish, and 1970–71 saw the club win the Second Division and return to the top tier.\n\nOn 1 July 1971, he took over at Manchester United, having been confirmed in the role the previous month. He replaced Matt Busby, who had selected him for the role, signing a five-year contract worth £15,000 a year. Musgrove was again his assistant. His arrival came just three years after United had won the European Cup, but the side had posted eighth-place finishes in the First Division in the previous two seasons before O'Farrell's arrival.\n\nO'Farrell's tenure started well, with Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best playing well and the club, 10 points clear at one stage, losing just one of their first 14 league games. O'Farrell was named Manager of the Month for September and the club topped the table for the first time in three years in October. After being top of the league at Christmas, Best failed to attend training throughout January and United scored only three goals in their first eight games of the year, losing the first seven. O'Farrell's impersonal approach whereby every player had to schedule an appointment to see him, did not help morale. O'Farrell signed Martin Buchan for a club-record fee of £125,000, as well as Ian Storey-Moore, who scored in all of United's five league wins in the second half of the season. Once again, United ended the season in eighth place.\n\nFurther problems with Best led to a two-week suspension for the player and he continued to miss training sessions during the 1972–73 season. Forwards Wyn Davies and Ted MacDougall were signed in September 1972, bringing O'Farrell's spending in the previous six months to £500,000. On 6 December, it was announced that Best would be transfer listed. On 16 December, United lost 5–0 to Crystal Palace, with Don Rogers scoring twice, and three days after the match, with the club third-from-bottom in the league, O'Farrell was sacked after 18 months in the role. He was replaced at Old Trafford by Tommy Docherty. O'Farrell as the only Irish manager in Manchester United's history. His sacking resulted in O'Farrell suing the club over unpaid wages and he was forced to sign on at the local labour exchange while the dispute was settled. The club ultimately settled out-of-court and O'Farrell received \"about £17,000\".\n\nHe became manager of Cardiff City in November 1973, but in April 1974 quit to take the manager's post with the Iranian national team. He began his tenure with seven consecutive wins, leading them to the gold medal at the 1974 Asian Games and qualification for the Montreal Olympics. In January 2006, O'Farrell was invited to Iran to attend a ceremony in honour of Persepolis' former players, along with Alan Rogers.\n\nOn 29 November 1976, O'Farrell returned to Torquay United as manager, replacing Malcolm Musgrove. He remained with the club as consultant manager when Mike Green was appointed as player-manager in March 1977. In 1980, he joined United Arab Emirati club Al-Shaab. He became Torquay manager again when Green left the club in May 1981, but once again relinquished the position the following year, this time in July 1982 on the appointment of Bruce Rioch. He worked as general manager until his retirement in 1983, aged 55.\n\nAfter his retirement, O'Farrell continued to live in Torquay. In 1993, he worked as a scout for Everton and Bolton Wanderers. In later life, he ran a nursing home in Devon with his wife, Ann. He had been active in church affairs and presided over the local Conference of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. In 2011, his autobiography \"All Change at Old Trafford\" was published. In 2018, he was recorded as the oldest living player of West Ham United, still living in Devon, and caring for his wife.\n\nWeymouth\n\nTorquay United\n\nLeicester City\n\nCardiff City\n\nIran\n\n"}

With a drummer (Darren Shearer), bass guitarist (Dan Kurtz, now playing with Dragonette), and keyboard player (Jamie Shields), the music incorporates many elements of modern electronica, which they have branded live progressive breakbeat house.\n\nThe band formed in 1998 after an impromptu jam session they had at the Toronto venue the Comfort Zone. Upon listening to a recording of the show, they were transfixed by how much it sounded like a DJ mix. They subsequently released the jam session as their first album, \"This Is Live.\"\n\nThe band was without a name prior to the release of \"This Is Live\". Jamie Shields, whose previous band One Step Beyond had wrapped up recently, indicated that the band hadn't settled on a name. At one point, they were calling themselves \"Reprise\". \"The New Deal\" stuck shortly afterwards.\n\nOriginally billing themselves as an acid jazz group, they soon found themselves swept up into the emerging musical genre of livetronica. The drumming of Shearer often resembles the simplicity of a drum machine, while still tastefully complementing the accompanying music. Shields never loops a keyboard track and always plays everything live, even if a pattern is to be repeated. Thanks to the widespread sharing of bootleg versions of their early live shows, a national buzz ensued and within two years, and they signed a major label contract with Jive Electro.\n\nThe promotion with Jive proved disappointing, and the band fell short of a highly anticipated crossover. Nonetheless, they continued to tour, developing their fanbase, including a performance in Toronto at the Palais Royale in 2001.\n\nThey released several more live shows on a label they created, Sound+Light Records, and produced two studio releases in 2003: \"Please Be Seated\" and \"Gone Gone Gone\". In 2004, after a year-long hiatus, The New Deal toured several cities, often playing to crowds of 800 or more demonstrating the continued devotion of their fans.\n\nThe band continued to tour, and over 200 recorded shows have been made available at the Internet Archive and etree for downloading. In recent years, seeing the band live has been difficult as concerts have become sporadic. Only a few recent concerts have been made available because of difficulties accommodating \"tapers\" and obtaining soundboard recordings.\n\nOn April 8, 2011, an e-mail was sent out stating The New Deal would be breaking up in 2011. According to the e-mail, the band feels \"We have come to a point where the time and commitment that it takes to maintain our band at its best is no longer possible.\". A summer and fall tour took place throughout North America to end off the 12-year career.\n\nIn April 2014, the band resurrected their website with the text, \"The New Deal is Back – Summer 2014\". Joel Stouffer was brought on board as a new drummer in 2014.\n\nIn March 20 2019 the band announced on Facebook that they are coming back together for a short summer run of 4 shows with Davide Di Renzo as a new drummer, going on to say \"With Davide it’s a bit like ‘coming back home’ as he was the drummer that inspired our original direction back in 1998 when the three of us played our first impromptu gig together in Guelph, Ontario. Each of the band’s drummers has brought something unique to theNEWDEAL, and with Davide we’re reaching back to move forward with the organic-infused improvisation that has long-inspired a big part of theNEWDEAL sound.\" In August of that year they announced a tour schedule through the following February with Di Renzo.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1797108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797108", "title": "Karen Wetterhahn", "text": "Karen Wetterhahn\n\nKaren Elizabeth Wetterhahn (October 16, 1948 – June 8, 1997) was an American professor of chemistry at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire who specialized in toxic metal exposure. She died of mercury poisoning at the age of 48 due to accidental exposure to the organic mercury compound dimethylmercury (Hg(CH)). Protective gloves in use at the time of the incident provided insufficient protection, and exposure to only a few drops of the chemical absorbed through the gloves proved to be fatal after less than a year.\n\nWetterhahn was born in Plattsburgh, New York, and had degrees from St. Lawrence University and Columbia University. She joined Dartmouth's faculty in 1976 and published more than 85 research papers. In 1990, Wetterhahn helped establish Dartmouth College's Women in Science Project (WISP), which helped to raise the share of women science majors from 13 to 25 percent at Dartmouth College and has become a national model.\n\nOn August 14, 1996, Wetterhahn, a specialist in toxic metal exposure, was studying the way mercury ions interact with DNA repair proteins, and she was investigating the toxic properties of another highly toxic heavy metal, cadmium.\n\nDimethylmercury was a compound used, almost exclusively, as a reference standard for Hg nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, a particular type of specialized chemical analysis.\n\nWetterhahn would recall that she had spilled one or two drops of dimethylmercury from the tip of a pipette onto her latex-gloved hand. Not believing herself in any immediate danger, as she was taking all recommended precautions, she proceeded to clean up the area prior to removing her protective clothing. However, tests later revealed that dimethylmercury can, in fact, rapidly permeate different kinds of latex gloves and enter the skin within about 15 seconds. The exposure was later confirmed by hair testing, which showed a dramatic jump in mercury levels 17 days after the initial accident, peaking at 39 days, followed by a gradual decline.\n\nApproximately three months after the initial accident Wetterhahn began experiencing brief episodes of abdominal discomfort and noted significant weight loss. The more distinctive neurological symptoms of mercury poisoning, including loss of balance and slurred speech, appeared in January 1997, five months after the accident. At this point, tests proved that she had a debilitating mercury intoxication. Her urinary mercury content had risen to 234 µg per liter; its normal range is from 1 to 5 and the toxic level is > 50 μg/L.\n\nDespite aggressive chelation therapy, her condition rapidly deteriorated. Three weeks after the first neurological symptoms appeared, Wetterhahn lapsed into what appeared to be a vegetative state punctuated by periods of extreme agitation. One of her former students said that \"Her husband saw tears rolling down her face. I asked if she was in pain. The doctors said it didn't appear that her brain could even register pain.\" Wetterhahn was removed from life support and died on June 8, 1997, less than a year after her initial exposure.\n\nWetterhahn's death shocked not only the entire chemistry department at Dartmouth, but also regulatory agencies, as the accidental exposure occurred despite her having taken all required measures known at that time. These included the use of latex gloves, a fume hood, and adherence to standard safety procedures. After Wetterhahn's mercury poisoning was discovered, her colleagues tested various safety gloves against dimethylmercury and found that the small, apolar molecule diffuses through most of them in seconds, much more quickly than expected. As a result, it is now recommended to wear plastic-laminate gloves when handling dimethylmercury.\n\nAt the time, dimethylmercury was the common calibration standard for Hg NMR spectroscopy because it has certain advantages over the alternatives that exist. As a consequence of Wetterhahn's accident, safety recommendations have been revised, and the use of dimethylmercury for any purpose has been highly discouraged.\n\nDartmouth College has since established an award in Wetterhahn's name to encourage other women to pursue careers in science. Whenever possible, preference in granting the award is given to a woman. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences also maintains an annual award, for a graduate student or post-doctoral researcher, in honor of Karen Wetterhahn.\n\n"}
{"id": "1797111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797111", "title": "Committee of Nine", "text": "Committee of Nine\n\nThe Committee of Nine was a group of conservative political leaders in Virginia led by Alexander H. H. Stuart following the American Civil War when Virginia was required to adopt a new Constitution acknowledging the abolition of slavery before its readmission into the Union. They engineered the federal and state political machinery so that separate votes would be taken on the constitution (which was overwhelmingly ratified) and provisions restricting voting and office-holding rights of former Confederates (which was narrowly defeated). \n\nFollowing the American Civil War and testimony before Congress that President Andrew Johnson's self-reconstruction was not allowing newly freed slaves many civil rights, Congress passed four Reconstruction Acts which set forth requirements for civilians to take control over the state governments in formerly Confederate states, instead of the military. Because Virginia's 1850 Constitution supported slavery, which became illegal during the American Civil War, and the delegates drafting the 1864 Constitution under provisional Governor Francis Harrison Pierpont did not represent the entire state, Virginia needed to draft and adopt a new Constitution to end military rule.\n\nMany high-ranking former Confederates were not permitted and others chose not to vote for members of the Constitutional Convention of 1867-68, which included African American delegates and abolitionist federal judge John Curtiss Underwood dominated. The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868 actually began its work in December 1867. Virginia newspapers and Conservatives, including Alexander H.H. Stuart began criticizing the Convention, particularly its African-American members, during that month.\n\nNonetheless, the Convention continued, and did include former Confederates as members. Major areas of debate concerned state administration, voting regulations, restrictions on officeholding by former Confederates, and social policies. During acrimonious sessions in early 1868, many Conservative members either left or were dismissed by the Convention before it approved a draft in April, which needed to be approved by voters. The \"Underwood Constitution\" included \"free schools for both races, equal rights provisions, and reforms of local government.\" \n\nIt also included controversial and very strict clauses concerning ex-Confederates, which were unpopular, so Virginia's military ruler during Congressional Reconstruction, General John Schofield and later President-elect Ulysses S. Grant delayed the ratification vote for what turned out to be more than a year. Meanwhile, by the autumn of 1868, Virginia's Republican party split because of the anti-Confederate provisions. Governor Henry H. Wells (who succeeded Pierpont) argued that Unionists would be at risk in Virginia if the disabling clauses were removed from the proposed Virginia Constitution.\n\nStuart had appointed former Confederate general John Echols as part of a committee of three, along with F. G. Ruffin and James D. Johnston, which was to recommend eight other men to serve in the Committee of Nine. Echols would never formally become a member of the Committee of Nine, although he worked closely with Stuart to publish the \"Senex\" letter described below and set up the compromise.\nBy the end of 1868, Republicans who had been displeased with the final constitution approved by the convention joined forces with what formally became the Committee of Nine. These Republicans, such as Edgar Allan and Franklin Stearns, worked with the committee in Washington in the fight for a separate vote on the anti-Confederate provisions. They joined in meeting important Congressmen since the Republicans dominated the Congress at the time, and their work proved influential. Nonetheless, when the Congress reassembled in December 1868, the Virginia Republican executive committee requested a vote on the Underwood constitution. On December 9, the House Committee of Reconstruction passed a bill to provide money for the referendum, however, the Christmas holiday recess arrived before the Senate received the bill.\n\nAlexander H. H. Stuart wanted to get rid of the disenfranchisement clauses (which Conservatives particularly disliked, and moderate Republicans thought abrogated General Grant's terms given to Confederate General Robert E. Lee) before the referendum was held. Stuart wrote a letter to outline his plans and publicize his objections concerning the clauses. He argued for universal amnesty and for the creation of another constitution with the disenfranchisement clauses to present to the Congress. His letter was published in the Richmond papers under the pseudonym, \"Senex.\"\n\nIn his work, \"A narrative of the leading incidents of the organization of the first popular movement in Virginia in 1865 to re-establish peaceful relations between the northern and southern states, and the subsequent efforts of the \"Committee of Nine,\" in 1869, to secure the restoration of Virginia to the Union\", Alexander H. H. Stuart describes his motives behind writing and publishing the letter as following:\"I have no doubt that hundreds—nay, thousands—of my fellow-citizens thought and felt as I did as to the necessity of taking action on the subject. But no one seemed to be willing to assume the responsibility of taking the lead! Under these circumstances, as the necessity for moving in the matter was urgent, and the time within which action likely to lead to a successful result was limited to two weeks, I determined to\nsound a note of alarm by calling the attention of the people of Virginia to the frightful dangers which threatened them, and urging those who thought as I did to unite in an organized attempt to avert them. With this object in view, I wrote “a communication,” over the signature “Senex,” intended for publication in the Richmond Dispatch. This paper was written entirely on my own responsibility, and without conference or consultation with anyone. My purpose was to try and arouse the people to the necessity of immediate action, and to suggest as the most feasible, if not the only, means of obtaining relief from the disenfranchisement and test oaths embodied in the Underwood Constitution, the tender to Congress on behalf of Virginia of a compromise, on the basis of universal suffrage as an equivalent for universal amnesty.\"\n\nAlthough some Conservatives criticized Stuart's letter, many moderates and centrist Virginians favored Stuart's plan. These Virginians met at the Exchange Hotel, in Richmond, on December 31, 1868 and January 1, 1869. Their meetings led to the creation of the Committee of Nine: Alexander H. H. Stuart would act as a chairman to a committee of nine people who would visit Washington to voice objections concerning the Underwood Constitution. \nThe committee aimed to go to Washington to authorize separate votes on the proposed new state constitution, and the provision which continued to disenfranchise former Confederates (mostly white Virginians) under the Reconstruction Acts.\n\nJohn L. Marye, of Fredericksburg, one of the members of the Committee of Nine, suggested that Stuart invite Gilbert C. Walker, a northerner and who had been \"defeated for a seat in the Underwood convention\", to help the committee gain support in Washington. As predicted, Walker, a northern Republican, helped the committee receive sympathy in the north. Horace Greeley's Republican newspaper, New York Tribune, joined the campaign. The Committee of Nine spent approximately two weeks in Washington. They met with congressmen and appeared before both the House and Senate committees.\n\nUpon meeting with the Committee of Nine, and despite Governor Wells following the Committee of Nine and their supporters around in Washington, Congress approved the separation of the disabling clauses. However, in order to be readmitted, it required Virginia to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment as well.\n\nDuring meetings with members of the Committee of Nine in Washington, President-elect Grant showed sympathy towards the committee's objects and plans. \n\nGrant was inaugurated on March 4, 1869. On May 14, 1869, President Grant issued the following proclamation:“Every person who has been a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President or Vice-President, or who held any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State Legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” The committee thus achieved its goal of authorizing a separate vote for the provisions restricting former Confederates and sympathizers.\n\nRadical Republicans and Governor Wells (who became their candidate for actual election as Governor) wanted the referendum to take place as the Convention had stated. They feared that the separate votes would lead to failure of the anti-Confederate provisions and thus restore conservative dominance in the state. In March 1869, Virginia Republicans held a convention to nominate candidates for the state elections.\n\nModerate Republicans were sometimes referred to as \"Stearns Republicans\", after Franklin Stearns, and also included William L. Owen, and Gilbert C. Walker. Although they failed to gain control of the Republican party, they nominated Walker, a former northern businessman as a moderate candidate. The alliance between the moderate Republicans and Conservatives led to Gilbert C. Walker winning the Gubernatorial Election of 1869. \n\nEven though Radical Republicans, who had passed the Reconstruction Acts in 1866, still dominated the Congress, because the provisions of the new Constitution other than the anti-Confederate provisions passed overwhelmingly, Virginia was readmitted into the Union on January 26, 1870. Virginia's new Governor, Gilbert C. Walker, signed a letter announcing the readmission.\n\n\nAs the chairman, Stuart opened conferences when members appeared before federal legislators, as well as publicly set forth their objections to the Underwood Constitution.\n\n\nCSA Colonel Baldwin presented and elaborated on their views to the House and the Senate. He also wrote a paper requested by the Senate Judiciary Committee which explained the alterations the Committee of Nine wanted to make in the Underwood Constitution. All of the members signed the documents. Stuart stated that with this role, Baldwin became \"the most conspicuous member of the committee.\"\n\n\nCSA Colonel W. T. Sutherlin, of Danville, was among those who joined Alexander H. H. Stuart at the Exchange Hotel in Richmond, as was General Echols. After hearing Stuart's words, Sutherlin promised to work with them. Later, General Echols met with various newspapers to publish the \"Senex\" articles, although many refused, including \"Richmond Dispatch\" and \"Richmond Enquirer\". After Sutherlin joined Echols to visit the \"Richmond Whig,\" editor Alexander Mosely agreed to publish them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This neologism has not gained widespread acceptance in the mathematical community.\n\nThe method is most commonly used to multiply linear binomials. For example,\nIf either binomial involves subtraction, the corresponding terms must be negated. For example,\n\nThe FOIL method is equivalent to a two-step process involving the distributive law:\nIn the first step, the () is distributed over the addition in first binomial. In the second step, the distributive law is used to simplify each of the two terms. Note that this process involves a total of three applications of the distributive property. In contrast to the FOIL method, the method using distributive can be applied easily to products with more terms such as trinomials and higher.\n\nThe FOIL rule converts a product of two binomials into a sum of four (or fewer, if like terms are then combined) monomials. The reverse process is called \"factoring\" or \"factorization\". In particular, if the proof above is read in reverse it illustrates the technique called factoring by grouping.\n\nA visual memory tool can replace the FOIL mnemonic for a pair of polynomials with any number of terms. Make a table with the terms of the first polynomial on the left edge and the terms of the second on the top edge, then fill in the table with products. The table equivalent to the FOIL rule looks like this.\nIn the case that these are polynomials, , the terms of a given degree are found by adding along the antidiagonals\nso formula_7\n\nTo multiply , the table would be as follows.\nThe sum of the table entries is the product of the polynomials. Thus\nSimilarly, to multiply , one writes the same table\nand sums along antidiagonals:\n\nThe FOIL rule cannot be directly applied to expanding products with more than two multiplicands, or multiplicands with more than two summands. However, applying the associative law and recursive foiling allows one to expand such products. For instance,\nAlternate methods based on distributing forgo the use of the FOIL rule, but may be easier to remember and apply. For example,\n\n"}

{"id": "1797159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797159", "title": "Dave Sexton", "text": "Dave Sexton\n\nDavid James Sexton OBE (6 April 1930 – 25 November 2012) was an English football manager and player.\n\nSon of former professional boxer Archie Sexton, he started his professional career with Luton Town in 1951, following spells with non-league clubs Newmarket Town and Chelmsford City. Playing mainly at inside-forward, he would finish his career with time at West Ham United, Leyton Orient, Brighton and Hove Albion, and Crystal Palace. His biggest success came at Brighton, where he won the Third Division (South) Title in 1957–58.\n\nSexton started off as a coach at Chelsea, before leaving to begin his managerial career at Leyton Orient in 1965. In 1966 he was appointed by Arsenal manager Bertie Mee as the Gunners' first-team coach, but a year later returned to Chelsea to become manager following the departure of Tommy Docherty. He led the club to FA Cup success in 1970 and the European Cup Winners' Cup a year later. Chelsea also reached the League Cup final in 1972, but lost to Stoke City. However, Sexton fell out with several players, including Peter Osgood and Alan Hudson, who were subsequently sold. This, combined with other problems at the club, ensured that Sexton did not come close to repeating his earlier success and early in the 1974–75 season – which ended in Chelsea's relegation – he was dismissed.\n\nA few weeks later in October 1974 he was appointed manager of Queens Park Rangers as successor to Gordon Jago. With a team containing the likes of Stan Bowles and Gerry Francis, as well as players recruited from ex-club Chelsea, John Hollins and David Webb, Sexton took Rangers to within a point of the League title in 1975–76. The 3–2 defeat at Norwich City in their final away game of that season marked the end of a 14-match unbeaten run which had produced a spectacular 13 wins and one draw. They were top after playing their final home game versus Leeds United on 24 April 1976, but Liverpool's late 3–1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on 4 May 1976 denied them their first-ever league title. Still, second place was – and remains – their highest league finish. UEFA Cup qualification came as consolation.\n\nSexton took over at Manchester United – again succeeding Tommy Docherty – in the middle of 1977 but his reign was characterised by dour football and he was not popular with the fans. In appointing Sexton it appeared as if the United board had again opted for safety following the tumultuous tenure of Docherty (sacked for having an affair with the wife of the club's physiotherapist), whose four-and-a-half-year spell had overseen relegation from the First Division but an immediate comeback followed by high league finishes and completed with an FA Cup triumph in the season before Sexton's appointment.\n\nThe highlight was an FA Cup final appearance in 1979, losing 3–2 to Arsenal in a dramatic match, and finishing as league runners-up to Liverpool in 1979–80. His signings brought mixed success. Midfielder Ray Wilkins was bought from Chelsea in 1979 and soon established himself as one of Europe's finest midfielders, and striker Joe Jordan scored more than 50 goals in three years after arriving from Leeds United in 1978. On a less positive note, Sexton paid a club record £1.25 million for Nottingham Forest striker Garry Birtles in 1980, but a player who had been one of the country's finest goalscorers with his old club failed to find the net once in 25 league appearances during the 1980–81 season.\n\nSexton was dismissed on 30 April 1981, despite having won his final seven games in charge, as United had finished eighth in the league and Sexton had now been in charge of them for four seasons without winning a major trophy. The FA Cup final appearance two years earlier and the narrow second-place finish behind Liverpool a year earlier was of little consolation.\n\nA few weeks after being dismissed, he was appointed as manager of Coventry City. In his first season, he managed a relatively average 14th-place finish (which was still a slight improvement on the previous year), and the club appeared to be making progress, with the side mounting a serious challenge for the UEFA Cup places halfway through the 1982–83 season. However, a disastrous end to the campaign saw them win just once in their last fifteen games, with the club only avoiding relegation in the penultimate game of the season, which led to Sexton's dismissal. This would prove to be his last role in club management.\n\nSexton also had a very successful period as coach of the England's Under-21 side, and won the UEFA Under 21s Championship twice, in 1982 and 1984. After that he went on the become the FA's first Technical Director at the FA's National School at Lilleshall in 1984. He also wrote a book on coaching a football team for coaches of all levels called \"Tackle Soccer.\"\n\nHe later lived in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, where in 2008 he was commemorated with a new building in the town centre. He lived in Kenilworth after becoming Coventry City manager in 1981 and the building in his honour, Sexton House, is a refurbished building divided between shops and offices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Seattle Mariners, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Figgins was a utility player, playing all positions except catcher, pitcher, and first base.\n\nFiggins played baseball at North Brandon Little League in Brandon, Florida. He attended Brandon High School where he was a third-team High School All-American as a senior. He was drafted in the fourth-round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Colorado Rockies. He was acquired by the Anaheim Angels in a trade in 2001 for Kimera Bartee.\nFiggins made his major league debut as a pinch runner on August 25, 2002, against the Boston Red Sox. His first hit was an RBI single to right field off Aaron Myette of the Texas Rangers on September 15, 2002. His first full season in the majors was 2004. On May 14, 2004, he went 5-for-6 in a 10 inning game against the Baltimore Orioles and hit his first home run off Kurt Ainsworth of the Orioles. His breakout year came in 2005, when he was moved to leadoff hitter after original leadoff hitter David Eckstein signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. He used his speed to steal an American League-high 62 bases, the second-most in Angels history. That year, he played two positions in the same game 24 times. He was named team co-MVP of the 2005 season for the Angels, along with Bartolo Colón.\n\nPrior to the 2006 season, the Angels signed Figgins to a three-year, $10.5-million deal. He had been eligible for salary arbitration. Figgins became the fifth Angel to hit for the cycle on September 16, 2006, at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Against the Oakland Athletics on September 29, 2006, he hit his first career inside-the-park home run at Angel Stadium. Along with third base, Figgins also played shortstop, second base, and all three outfield positions. Although he was initially considered for the center field job in 2006, the Angels decided to move Darin Erstad back to the position. Figgins became the starter at third base. With Erstad on the disabled list for much of the season, however, Figgins saw more time in center field.\n\nOn March 21, 2007, in a spring training game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Figgins suffered two broken fingers on his throwing hand while attempting to field a ground ball hit by Conor Jackson. He began the season on the disabled list and did not return till the end of April. In June 2007, Figgins recorded an Angels team-record 53 hits in a month, breaking the record set by Darin Erstad in April 2000. With six hits on June 18, 2007, against the Houston Astros, including a walk-off triple, Figgins matched the American League (AL) record for most hits in a nine-inning game. On July 15, 2007, Figgins stole his 187th base as an Angel, breaking the 20-year-old club record previously held by Gary Pettis, in attendance that day as a coach for the visiting Texas Rangers.\n\nIn 2009, Figgins was selected to his first All-Star Game. He finished the season with an AL-best 101 walks and finished 10th in AL MVP voting. Although Figgins stole 42 bases in 2009, he was caught 17 times – tied for the most in the majors.\n\nOn December 4, 2009, it was reported that Figgins and the Seattle Mariners agreed to a four-year contract worth approximately $36 million. During spring training for the 2010 season, Figgins was converted to second base, moving teammate Jose Lopez to third. Figgins had his worst year to date in 2010, batting just .259, though he did match his previous season stolen base total of 42. Following the season, Figgins converted back to third base, due to the departure of Lopez. Halfway through the 2011 season, he was replaced by Adam Kennedy as the everyday third baseman. In only 81 games, with only 288 at bats, Figgins finished the season batting only .188.\n\nTo begin the 2012 season, Figgins was allowed the opportunity to bat leadoff for the Mariners in the hopes that the return to the spot in the lineup where he thrived during his time with the Angels would jump start his bat. On May 4 of that season, manager Eric Wedge announced that Figgins would no longer be an everyday player. He ended the 2012 season batting .181 with 166 at bats in 66 games and was designated for assignment by the Mariners on November 20, 2012.\n\nOn February 8, 2013, he signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. However, he did not make the team out of spring training and was released on March 20.\n\nAfter sitting out the 2013 season, Figgins signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for 2014. The Dodgers purchased his contract on March 16 and added him to the Major League roster. In 38 games with the Dodgers, he appeared as a utility player/pinch hitter and hit .217, though he had a .373 OBP due to drawing 14 walks in 76 plate appearances. He was placed on the disabled list in mid-June with a hip injury and then spent an extended time with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes on a rehab assignment. The Dodgers designated him for assignment on August 6, 2014. The Dodgers asked for unconditional release waivers on August 13. Figgins was not signed by another team.\n\nOn March 20, 2016, Figgins announced his retirement from professional baseball. He signed a one-day contract with the Angels in order to retire with the team.\n\nChone Figgins and his wife, Claudia, had a son, Desmond, Jr., in 2015.\n\n"}
{"id": "1797168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797168", "title": "Treachery of the Long Knives", "text": "Treachery of the Long Knives\n\nThe Treachery of the Long Knives () was a pseudohistorical massacre of British Celtic chieftains by Anglo-Saxon soldiers at a peace conference on Salisbury Plain in the 5th century. The story is not included in any contemporary accounts, but does feature centuries later in the semi-mythological histories of the \"Historia Brittonum\" and the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\". Though a popular cautionary tale in medieval Europe, no historical evidence for The Treachery of the Long Knives exists, and the story has been widely debunked as a purely literary construction by historians.\n\nAccording to the tradition, Vortigern, who had become a high king of the Britons in the wake of the end of Roman rule in Britain, called for Anglo-Saxons under Hengist and Horsa to settle on the Isle of Thanet in exchange for their service as mercenaries in battles against the Picts and Gaels in Scotland. The settlers, however, exploit a drunken Vortigern's lust for Hengist's daughter into allowing them to increase their numbers and granting them more land, eventually including all of the Kingdom of Kent.\n\nThere is no account of this event in the 6th-century writings of Gildas. The story first appears in the much later \"Historia Brittonum\", attributed to the Welsh historian Nennius, which was a compilation in Latin of various materials (some of which were historical and others mythic, literary or legendary) put together during the early 9th century, and surviving in 9th-century manuscripts – i.e., some 400 years after the supposed events. According to John Morris's textual analysis of the \"Historia\", this tale derived from a north Welsh narrative which was mainly about Emrys (Ambrosius Aurelianus), which the compiler of the \"Historia\" incorporated into a framework drawn from a Kentish chronicle, together with details from a \"Life of Saint Germanus\". \n\nThis is a literal translation of the Latin from Edmond Faral's (Paris 1929) edition of the text (sections in square brackets [thus] supplied from T. Mommsen's 1892 edition):\n\nIt happened however after the death of Vortimer, son of King Vortigern, and after the return of Hengist with his forces, they called for a false Council, so that they might work sorrow to Vortigern with his army. For they sent legates to ask for peace, that there might be perpetual friendship between them. So Vortigern himself with the elders by birth of his people [considered the matter and carefully thought over what they might do. And the same] opinion was with them all, that they should make peace, and their legates went back and afterwards called together the conference, so that on either side the Britons and Saxons (\"Brittones et Saxones\") should come together as one without arms, so that friendship should be sealed.\nAnd Hengistus ordered the whole of his household that each one should hide his knife (\"artavum\") under his foot in the middle of his shoe. 'And when I shall call out to you and say \"\"Eu nimet saxas\"\" (Hey, draw your swords!), then draw your knives (\"cultellos\") from the soles of your shoes, and fall upon them, and stand strongly against them. And do not kill their king, but seize him for the sake of my daughter whom I gave to him in matrimony, because it is better for us that he should be ransomed from our hands.' And they brought together the conference, and the Saxons, speaking in a friendly way, meanwhile were thinking in a wolvish way, and sociably they sat down man beside man (i.e. Saxon beside Briton). Hengistus, as he had said, spoke out, and all the three hundred elders of King Vortigern were slaughtered, and only he was imprisoned, and was chained, and he gave to them many regions for the ransom of his soul (i.e. life), that is Est Saxum, Sut saxum [, Middelseaxan, with other districts under his control which they named.]\nThe Treachery of the Long Knives is also described in Book 6 of the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote during the early 12th century and presumably used Nennius as his main source. According to him, the incident took place at a banquet in modern-day Wiltshire, ostensibly arranged to seal a peace treaty, which may have been the cession of Essex and Sussex in exchange for intermarriage between Rowena, the daughter of Saxon chieftain Hengest, and Vortigern. The story claims that the \"Saxons\" — which probably includes Angles and Jutes – arrived at the banquet armed with their long knives (\"seaxes\") hidden on their persons. During the feast, on a given word of command, they pulled their knives and killed the unarmed Britons sitting next to them. Vortigern himself was spared, but all his men were butchered, except Eldol, Earl of Gloucester, who escaped.\n\nIn 19th-century Wales, the term \"Brad y Llyfrau Gleision\" ('The Treachery of the Blue Books') was coined to refer to the report of the English commissioners on education in Wales, published in parliamentary blue covers in 1847, which was widely seen as an attack on the Welsh language. One of the effects of the report would be the exclusion of the Welsh language from Welsh schools for several generations and a consequent fall in the number of Welsh speakers.\n\nThe name Night of the Long Knives was later used for a violent political purge in Nazi Germany, when Hitler destroyed the power of the Sturmabteilung in 1934. It was also used flippantly when British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan dismissed seven members of his cabinet in a \"night of the long knives\". It has also been used to refer to the assassination of Alexander Burnes in November 1841 in Kabul, Afghanistan.\n\nIn Canada the term was used by Quebec premiere René Lévesque in reference to the repatriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1981. (Before that time, the final constitutional authority for Canada resided in the United Kingdom). Initially eight of the 10 provincial premieres were opposed to repatriating the constitution. A compromise was hammered out in Lévesque's absence, and 9 of the 10 (only Quebec dissenting) agreed to it.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1885, it is the second oldest medical school in California after the UCSF School of Medicine. \n\nIt is located on the university's Health Sciences campus in northeastern Los Angeles which is adjacent to the Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights neighborhoods.\n\nIn addition to a medical degree (MD), the school offers various combined degrees, such as MD/MPH, MD/PhD and MD/MBA. The school offers separate master's and doctoral degree programs in various biomedical fields. It also offers programs in physician assistantship and nurse anesthesia. \n\nThe joint MD-PhD program is part of a cooperation with the California Institute of Technology located in nearby Pasadena.\n\nUSC also offers a combined engineering and medicine graduate certificate program, available to both PhD and MD students. \n\nThere are several teaching hospitals, including LAC+USC Medical Center, a Level I trauma center located Downtown Los Angeles jointly operated by USC and the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. Keck Hospital of USC, and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles are also teaching hospitals.\n\nKeck Medicine of USC is an affiliated system of hospitals, clinics, and primary care providers and as of 2013, USC Health included three hospitals, some campus-based specialty clinics, five community-based ambulatory care clinics, and USC Care Medical Group, which is the physician practice of doctors who are on the faculty of the Keck School of Medicine. Hospitals and clinics include the Keck Hospital of USC and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, which USC acquired from Tenet Healthcare in 2009 for $275 million after three years of litigation between the parties, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the USC Verdugo Hills Hospital in Glendale.\n\nThe school was founded in 1885, and is the oldest medical school in Southern California.\n\nThe school's association with Children's Hospital Los Angeles began in 1932. In 1970, it formed the first academic Department of Emergency Medicine in the United States.\n\nBy 1983, the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center was opened. In 1991, the USC University Hospital, later to be renamed Keck Hospital of USC, was opened.\n\nIn July 1999, the W. M. Keck Foundation donated $110 million to the USC School of Medicine. The school was then renamed the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. The school committed to raising $330 million in matching funds, and used a large portion of the gift to expand research efforts, including the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute.\n\nIn 2015, Paul Aisen, who leads the US Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and its approximately $100 million in funding, left University of California San Diego and joined the faculty of Keck. Aisen had been recruited to UCSD from Georgetown in 2007 to run the ADCS which UCSD had established in 1991. Aisen left UCSD because he was unhappy with the level of support that UCSD was providing him and due to the offer from USC. UCSD and USC ended up in litigation over control of the program. USC rented space for Aisen in a San Diego office park, where Keck's Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute is located under Aisen's direction. Some aspects of data management were temporarily settled in 2016; as of 2017 the litigation was ongoing.\n\nA report in \"Nature\" noted that Keck had been recruiting from San Diego, hiring four scientists from Scripps Research Institute after a proposed merger fell through, and that Keck had recruited the director of the UCSD Health System to run its Children's Hospital.\n\nIn March 2016 Carmen Puliafito resigned as dean and Rohit Varma became the interim dean, and was named dean in November of that year.\n\nOn May 1, 2018, Laura Mosqueda was appointed as dean of the school. She is a professor of Family Medicine and Geriatrics. \n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" reported in July 2017 that while Puliafito served as dean and USC professor, he \"kept company with a circle of criminals and drug users who said he used methamphetamine and other drugs with them.\" The reporters reviewed video and photographs of Puliafito engaging in these activities in hotel rooms, apartments, and the dean's office. According to the newspaper, a 21-year-old prostitute had overdosed while taking drugs with Puliafito in a Pasadena hotel room on March 4, 2016; the article included a recording of a conversation between a 911 operator and Puliafito. The report said that police had found methamphetamine in the room. Puliafito resigned as dean three weeks afterwards.

At low bit rates, i.e. high compression ratios, most of the coefficients produced by a subband transform (such as the wavelet transform)\nwill be zero, or very close to zero. This occurs because \"real world\" images tend to contain mostly low frequency information (highly correlated). However where high frequency information does occur (such as edges in the image) this is particularly important in terms of human perception of the image quality, and thus must be represented accurately in any high quality coding scheme.\n\nBy considering the transformed coefficients as a tree (or trees) with the lowest frequency coefficients at the root node and with the children of each tree node being the spatially related coefficients in the next higher frequency subband, there is a high probability that one or more subtrees will consist entirely of coefficients which are zero or nearly zero, such subtrees are called zerotrees. Due to this, we use the terms node and coefficient interchangeably, and when we refer to the children of a coefficient, we mean the child coefficients of the node in the tree where that coefficient is located. We use children to refer to directly connected nodes lower in the tree and descendants to refer to all nodes which are below a particular node in the tree, even if not directly connected.\n\nIn zerotree based image compression scheme such as EZW and SPIHT, the intent is to use the statistical properties of the trees in order to efficiently code the locations of the significant coefficients. Since most of the coefficients will be zero or close to zero, the spatial locations of the significant coefficients make up a large portion of the total size of a typical compressed image. A coefficient (likewise a tree) is considered significant if its magnitude (or magnitudes of a node and all its descendants in the case of a tree) is above a particular threshold. By starting with a threshold which is close to the maximum coefficient magnitudes and iteratively decreasing the threshold, it is possible to create a compressed representation of an image which progressively adds finer detail. Due to the structure of the trees, it is very likely that if a coefficient in a particular frequency band is insignificant, then all its descendants (the spatially related higher frequency band coefficients) will also be insignificant.\n\nEZW uses four symbols to represent (a) a zerotree root, (b) an isolated zero (a coefficient which is insignificant, but which has significant descendants), (c) a significant positive coefficient and (d) a significant negative coefficient. The symbols may be thus represented by two binary bits. The compression algorithm consists\nof a number of iterations through a dominant pass and a subordinate pass, the threshold is updated (reduced by a factor of two) after each iteration. The dominant pass encodes the significance of the coefficients which have not yet been found significant in earlier iterations, by scanning the trees and emitting one of the four symbols. The children of a coefficient are only scanned if the coefficient was found to be significant, or if the coefficient was an isolated zero. The subordinate pass emits one bit (the most significant bit of each coefficient not so far emitted) for each coefficient which has been found significant in the previous significance passes. The subordinate pass is therefore similar to bit-plane coding.\n\nThere are several important features to note. Firstly, it is possible to stop the compression algorithm at any time and obtain an approximation of the original image, the greater the number of bits received, the better the image. Secondly, due to the way in which the compression algorithm is structured as a series of decisions, the same algorithm can be run at the decoder to reconstruct the coefficients, but with the decisions being taken according to the incoming bit stream. In practical implementations, it would be usual to use an entropy code such as arithmetic code to further improve the performance of the dominant pass. Bits from the subordinate pass are usually random enough that entropy coding provides no further coding gain.\n\nThe coding performance of EZW has since been exceeded by SPIHT and its many derivatives.\n\nEmbedded zerotree wavelet algorithm (EZW) as developed by J. Shapiro in 1993, enables scalable image transmission and decoding. It is based on four key concepts: first, it should be a discrete wavelet transform or hierarchical subband decomposition; second, it should predict the absence of significant information when exploring the self-similarity inherent in images; third, it has entropy-coded successive-approximation quantization, and fourth, it is enabled to achieve universal lossless data compression via adaptive arithmetic coding.\n\nBesides, the EZW algorithm also contains the following features:\n\n(1) A discrete wavelet transform which can use a compact multiresolution representation in the image.\n\n(2) Zerotree coding which provides a compact multiresolution representation of significance maps.\n\n(3) Successive approximation for a compact multiprecision representation of the significant coefficients.\n\n(4) A prioritization protocol which the importance is determined by the precision, magnitude, scale, and spatial location of the wavelet coefficients in order.\n\n(5) Adaptive multilevel arithmetic coding which is a fast and efficient method for entropy coding strings of symbols.\n\nIn a significance map, the coefficients can be representing by the following four different symbols. With using these symbols to represent the image information, the coding will be less complication.\n\nIf the magnitude of a coefficient is less than a threshold T, and all its descendants are less than T, then this coefficient is called zerotree root. And if a coefficient has been labeled as zerotree root, it means that all of its descendants are insignificant, so there is no need to label its descendants.\n\nIf the magnitude of a coefficient that is less than a threshold T, but it still has some significant descendants, then this coefficient is called isolated zero.\n\nIf the magnitude of a coefficient is greater than a threshold T at level T, and also is positive, than it is a positive significant coefficient.\n\nIf the magnitude of a coefficient is greater than a threshold T at level T, and also is negative, than it is a negative significant coefficient.\n\nThe threshold using above can be defined as the type below.\n\nRaster scanning is the rectangular pattern of image capture and reconstruction. Using this scanning on EZW transform is to perform scanning the coefficients in such way that no child node is scanned before its parent node. Also, all positions in a given subband are scanned before it moves to the next subband.\n\nThis determine that if the coefficient is in the interval [Ti, 2Ti). And a refinement bit is coded for each significant coefficient.\n\nIn this method, it will visit the significant coefficients according to the magnitude and raster order within subbands.\n\nThis method will code a bit for each coefficient that is not yet be seen as significant. Once a determination of significance has been made, the significant coefficient is included in a list for further refinement in the refinement pass. And if any coefficient already known to be zero, it will not be coded again.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1901, it is the largest regional referral center for children in critical condition who need life-saving care. Each year, it cares for nearly 140,000 infants, children and young adults by providing more than 350 pediatric programs and services. The hospital has been academically affiliated with the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California since 1932.\n\nCHLA is ranked as the No. 5 hospital by U.S. News & World Report and is the No. 1 ranked hospital for children in California. It has also received Magnet Recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center.\n\nWhile most of the children admitted come from Los Angeles County, others come from the seven-county area near Los Angeles that includes Kern, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. Additional referrals come from elsewhere around the world.\n\nCHLA also has five outpatient specialty centers (located in Arcadia, Encino, Santa Monica, South Bay/Torrance, Glendale, and Valencia), as well as dozens of specialty physician offices across the Los Angeles Area.\n\nThe hospital does not turn away patients regardless of socioeconomic status or insurance coverage.\n\nChildren's Hospital Los Angeles is home to The Saban Research Institute (TSRI), one of the largest and most productive pediatric research centers in the Western United States. The institution conducts laboratory, clinical, translational and community research designed to investigate the developmental origins of health and disease. More than 400 faculty collaborate to combat cancer, heart disease, brain disorders, autism, obesity and diabetes, among other devastating pediatric conditions. The hospital is the eighth most productive center in the nation, as measured by its funding levels from the National Institutes of Health—which provides highly competitive grants to researchers.\n\nTraining programs include 364 medical students, 277 student shadowers, 93 full-time residents, three chief residents and 127 fellows. For the past 19 years, 96 percent of those graduating from the CHLA Residency Program passed the American Board of Pediatrics exam on the first attempt, well above the national average of 75 to 80 percent.\n\nIn 2013, Stanley Black donated a $15 million to fund research and clinical care programs; CHLA's Gateway Building was renamed the Joyce and Stanley Black Family Building.\n\nThe hospital has been academically affiliated with the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California since 1932.

The timetabled journey time from one terminus to the other is nine minutes. It is completely separated from the rest of the London Overground.\n\nThe line was originally built as a branch of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR) and opened on 7 June 1893 providing the LT&SR with a link to the Great Eastern Railway at Romford and a small goods yard where the branch joins the Great Eastern Main Line. At Romford the branch had a separate station entrance in a three-storey building opposite the Great Eastern station entrance and a cast-iron footbridge was constructed over South Street which opened when a LT&SR train was due. When in April 1934 the LT&SR building ceased use as a station and the ground floor was rented as a shop, the then London and North Eastern Railway took control of the whole station.\nEmerson Park Halt was opened on 1 October 1909. A run-round loop was constructed 500 yards to the west to enable extra trains to run between Emerson Park and Upminster. When push-pull working began in 1934 the loop was no longer required and was removed in circa 1936.\n\nFrom 17 September 1956 a diesel multiple unit from replaced the steam service and from 20 April 1957 a new bay platform, numbered six, opened at effectively making it part of the Great Eastern route.\n\nThere were some attempts to close the line in the 1960s, but these failed. It was later electrified, and electric trains began operating on 17 April 1986.\n\nThe line transferred to become part of the London Overground network in May 2015.\n\nThe branch is known colloquially as the \"Romford Push and Pull\" as it is single-track throughout. It is electrified at 25 kV AC. Electrification of the line saw an end to years of speculation about its future. There is only one intermediate station, at Emerson Park. At the connection west of the station to the main line was severed in 1968.\n\nThe branch has just one signal, on approach to Romford. There were plans to link the line from platform six at Upminster to the reception tracks of the London Underground depot there. This would have allowed the transfer of London Underground D78 Stock units onto the main line to be hauled away by diesel locomotive for refurbishment at the Ilford depot. These plans were scrapped when the refurbishment work was transferred to Wakefield in Yorkshire and the transfer was done by road. The point-work which was half installed is still visible from the eastern end of platform five at Upminster.\n\nThe line is entirely within Travelcard Zone 6.\n\nServices are currently operated by London Overground, which replaced the previous operator, Abellio Greater Anglia, in May 2015. Trains are typically formed by a Class 315 with new Bombardier Aventras starting.\n\nAs of December 2015, the service pattern on the route is one train every 30 minutes between approximately 6:15 am and 10 pm Mondays to Saturdays, and approximately 8:30 am and 8 pm on Sundays. The journey time from one terminus to the other is approximately nine minutes.\n\nDuring the construction of the railway in 1892, the geologist T. V.

It comprises a coeducational junior school, single-sex senior schools and a coeducational sixth form. Founded in 1705 as a charity, the original schools are two of the oldest schools in the city.\n\nThey were founded by Dame Eleanor Allan, the daughter of a local goldsmith and the widow of a tobacco merchant, to provide a proper education for \"40 poor boys and 20 poor girls of the parishes of St Nicholas and St John\". The schools were endowed with land at Wallsend, to the east of Newcastle. The original school seems likely to have been near St Nicholas's Church, and certainly was by 1778. It moved to Manor Chare near All Saints' Church in 1786, to Carliol Square in 1821, to Rosemary Lane off Pudding Chare in 1861, and to Hanover Square in 1875. The school then moved to College Street in Newcastle in 1883 and remained there until 1935 when it re-located to the present site in Fenham.\n\nUntil 1988 the schools operated as separate boys' and girls' schools with a joint governing body. The governors then took the decision to appoint a principal with overall responsibility for the management of the two schools. At the same time, they created a joint mixed sixth form and reintroduced a mixed junior school. The plural, \"schools\", refers to the fact that Dame Allan's operates in a diamond format. In effect, Dame Allan's consists of 4 different schools: the co-educational Junior school for nursery to Year 6 are located in a separate building in Spital Tongues; the single sex boys' and girls' schools for years 7 to 11; and the co-educational sixth form (years 12 to 13).\n\nA number of new classrooms were built between 2004 and 2005 to replace older facilities, with some intended specifically for the sixth form centre. The Sixth Form Centre was opened by Queen Elizabeth II during an official visit on 14 October 2005 and was named the Queen's Building.\n\nSeptember 2012 saw the opening of the new nursery and junior school in Spital Tongues.\n\n2015 saw Dame Allan's chosen as the recipient of a £250,000 grant to help fund a £500,000 project. The grant was given by the Reece Foundation which promotes the improvement of education in engineering, technology and related subjects. The new facility will build on the Schools' existing master class programme.\n\nAll schools are private, and potential candidates must pass written exams and an interview. The fees are currently () around £4,412 per term in the Main Schools and £4,312 per term in the Junior Department. These fees include books and external examination entry fees, but do not include meals (£3.72 per day). Scholarships of up to 50% are available on the basis of academic merit, and bursaries of up to 100% are available on the basis of academic merit and financial need.\n\nBeing a private school, Dame Allan's does not strictly adhere to the National Curriculum. It does enter all its students in public examinations such as GCSEs and A-levels, so the subjects taught are closely tied into their national counterparts. All students must study English, mathematics, and the sciences to GCSE level, and it is strongly recommended that at least one foreign language be studied to this level. Sixth form students have a much wider range of study, with no mandatory subjects and the introduction of many new subjects in year 12, including A-levels in politics, psychology, sports, business and theatre studies. Dame Allan's is an Anglican school.\n\nIn 2005 the school recorded its best ever set of exam results, including a handful of Top 5 results in several subjects, notably GCSE languages. Furthermore, two pupils were awarded 6 grade As at A-level. The school consistently performs to an extremely high standard in public examinations, with the girls' school often slightly outscoring the boys' school at GCSE level. The school has not yet been inspected by OFSTED but received a positive report from the independent schools Inspectorate in 2000.\n\nThe 2000 inspection summarised the schools as \"a civilised and civilising community ...[which provides] a well-rounded education for pupils from the age of 8 to 18\" and the 2006 report states \"Dame Allan's are good schools with several great strengths and no significant weaknesses. The schools succeed very well in their key aims of providing a broad education for their pupils, where academic success is greatly valued but so is the moral, social and spiritual development of pupils.\"\n\nFormer pupils are known as Old Allanians.\n\n\n"}

Brothers\") in June 1967, when three members of the B.B. Brothers, guitarist Claus Bøhling, drummer Jens Otzen and British vocalist and bassist Mac MacLeod formed the power trio. Inspired by Cream but with more psychedelic leanings, they split from Peter Belli and MacLeod named the band 'Hurdy Gurdy'. They had considerable success in Scandinavia, breaking many attendance records for their live shows. The band moved to England in early 1968, after MacLeod had been deported from Denmark.\n\nFrom Denmark, MacLeod wrote to Donovan's manager Ashley Kozak on 19 December 1967 to ask if he could help the band in any way. Donovan wrote his song \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" for them as a gift for MacLeod. MacLeod came back to the U.K. in the new year to see Donovan and, a few weeks later, the rest of the band followed. After hearing Donovan's demo tape, the band set up outside his Little Berkhamsted cottage and played their version of the song. Donovan did not like the heavy take on the track they played as he wanted a softer, acoustic arrangement. Soon after, he released his own version of the song which became a hit, his version in the end had a similar arrangement to the Hurdy Gurdy version. Donovan told Keith Altham of the NME (and Hit Parader) in December 1968:\nWhile they were in the UK, they did some recordings produced by Chris White and Rod Argent of The Zombies. Two tracks by the MacLeod era of Hurdy Gurdy, \"Tick Tock Man\" and \"Neo Camel\", are on the Mac MacLeod anthology \"The Incredible Musical Odyssey of the Original Hurdy Gurdy Man\" and showcase the free-flowing power trio psychedelic rock sound that rivalled The Jimi Hendrix Experience in their live performances.\n\nOtzen and Bøhling had to return to Denmark shortly after those recordings, as they were unable to secure work permits from the Musician's Union. A new bassist (Torben Forne) was recruited to replace MacLeod and, in early 1971, they released a self-titled album for CBS which has recently been reissued on CD.

ACS Athens embraces American educational philosophy, principles and values.\n\nIt is located in Chalandri in the Athens area.\n\nIn 1946, the British Army School was established in several homes in the Glyfada area of Athens to educate the children of British military personnel who were stationed in Greece at the close of the Second World War. The history of ACS Athens begins here; for shortly after its inauguration, the school began to admit British and American civilians. In 1949, many more American children arrived in Greece, and a high school was opened for them in Kolonaki. Also established was an elementary school, in Psychico, which was later moved to a facility in Filothei. The British Army School had metamorphosed into the Anglo-American school.\n\nThe first yearbook of the new school, \"The Evzone\", published in 1952, highlights the accomplishments of a graduating class of six seniors who had graduated from a school that now occupied a rented villa in Kifissia. This house, complete with towers and turrets, served as the school's home until 1961. The same yearbook also documents the activities of Junior School students in a facility in Kalamaki, which would serve as the home of the Junior School until its operations were transferred to a building on the American base later in the decade following an airplane accident.\n\nThe 1954–55 school year marked another milestone in the history of the school. Chartered in the state of Delaware as a private, non-profit educational institution for the children of American diplomatic and military personnel, the Anglo-American School became the American Community Schools of Athens. From its inception, the school received no official subsidies, and its operations were funded by tuition fees. In December 1960, the ACS Athens School Board obtained funds under Public Law 480 to purchase land in Halandri, then a sleepy farming area, and began construction of a new school facility. The Class of 1962 was the first to graduate from the new facility.\n\nThe 1962 Evzone contains the following paragraph: \"This year's graduating class is the first to hold commencement exercises at the new American Academy located in the suburb of Halandri, approximately seven miles from the center of Athens. They were among 380 students who proudly took possession of the new building last September . Two-storied, containing twelve modern classrooms, two science laboratories, a library and a study hall, the building replaced an ancient villa in Kifissia on Tatoi Road which overflowed into four very unscholarly army huts. In the rear of our new school is a spacious playground area...By late spring of 1962, it appears that a new junior school will be erected on our present grounds, plus a gymnasium and an auditorium.\"\n\nA photograph of the campus in this same yearbook shows the new school building surrounded by open fields dotted with a few farmhouses. Until the early 1980s, ACS Athens students would follow the rituals of the school day to the accompaniment of the sound of bells clanging from the necks of the flocks of sheep and goats pastured in the neighboring fields.\n\nThe 1960s saw a continued expansion of the Halandri facilities. The Middle School was built in its present location in 1962; this was followed by the erection of the gymnasium the following year.\n\nIn 1964, the first two stories of the current Annex building were erected to house an elementary school. The first two stories of the current Elementary School were built in 1968. Throughout these years, ACS Athens continued to operate separate Elementary School facilities in Kifissia and on base. In 1968, yet another branch of ACS Athens was established on the island of Rhodes, for the approximately thirty children of Voice of America personnel stationed there. This branch of the school operated until 1981.\n\nIn 1963, the Greek government licensed the school to provide education to the children of Americans in official capacities. During that year, the school also began to admit students from the wider American and international expatriate communities in Greece, and ACS Athens began to take on an international flavor within the framework of an American school. (In the early 1980s, this license was amended, and ACS Athens was recognized by the Greek Ministry of Education as an educational institution for the international community in Greece.) The Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges accredited the high school in 1964. At the time, ACS Athens was one of only two international schools so distinguished. When, in 1983, the Middle States Association had expanded its accrediting authority to cover elementary and middle schools, ACS Athens received accreditation for its K-12 program.\n\nThe decade of the 1970s found ACS Athens engaged in its most ambitious building program. In 1974, the school saw the building of the bridge, containing science labs, administrative offices and a conference room, connecting the Academy and the Middle School; the current cafeteria, which originally served as the library; the amphitheater; and finally, the current library and fine arts classrooms. Additions to Annex and Elementary School buildings during the decade resulted in their taking their current form. The school's academic program was also expanded during these years: in 1976, ACS Athens became the only school in Greece to offer students the opportunity to earn an International Baccalaureate diploma as they pursued their high school studies. In 1978, the Department of Defense assumed control of the operation of the base school; at the same time, the international mix of the student body was enhanced by the arrival of a large Arabic community in the Athens area.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1979 students that were Military Dependents from the U.S. Air Base located near the old International Airport near Glyfada just south of Athens were bused into Halandri via off duty Tourist Buses. The route to the school took American Service Personnel's children through the heart of Athens and right by the Acropolis. American children of US Service Military personnel made up the majority of the student body population. The other large group attending ACS from 1976 to 1979 was a group of American Students whose parents worked for the American diplomatic corps. Other type of students was Greek-American students, Oil Field Worker's dependents, Australian-Greek students and Norwegian students. The school's long time principal was demoted to teacher in 1976 and became the most popular teacher in school. \"In 1979 there were 153 students that graduated from ACS in Athens\" says Patrick Mahoney who attended ACS in Athens from 1976 through 1979, graduated High School in 1979, played Nose Tackle for the Cougars and who was the only member of the work study program for three years.\n\nIn 1980, ACS Athens purchased the land currently occupied by the tennis courts. The Boarding Unit, originally housed in a hotel near the airport in Glyfada, and subsequently relocated to Kefalari and Nea Makri before moving to its current location in Mati, opened in 1981. As a result, the student body expanded to include, among others, many children of expatriate Americans working in the oil fields of the Arabian peninsula. In a major curricular innovation, ACS Athens established the ACS Athens Writing Project to promote the teaching of writing as a tool for learning across the disciplines in 1985.\n\nTwo years later, ACS Athens was selected as a sponsor of an International Writing Project site, with ACS Athens teachers engaged in training teachers from international schools around the world in Writing Project theory and methods. The Carnegie Commission for Promoting Excellence in Education recognized the quality of the school's academic program by awarding ACS Athens two citations for excellence during the latter part of the decade.\n\nIn 1986, ACS Athens closed the Kifissia Elementary School, and all school operations were consolidated at the Halandri campus, which had been expanded yet again with the building of new computer labs adjacent to the library. The purchase in 1988 of the public road which divided the campus allowed for the building of the central plaza which unified the campus. The closing of the American military bases during the 1992-93 school year, coupled with the Greek government's decision to allow Greek citizens to attend ACS Athens after completion of their compulsory education, resulted in yet another transformation in the complexion of the student body. While preserving its American character in philosophy and programs, ACS Athens, home to students representing over forty-five countries, was also ready to define itself as \"The International School in Greece.\"\n\nAnother milestone in ACS Athens' history occurred in 2004, when ACS Athens was authorized by the Greek Ministry of Education to offer classes and examinations leading to awarding the Greek Apolytirio.\n\nThe school is on one campus in the municipality of Halandri, at 129 Aghias Paraskevis Avenue. The student body is made up of over 1000 (2019-2020 data) students hailing from over 65 countries, and the school offers the American JK–12 curriculum, the International Baccalaureate IB Diploma, as well as a non-IB track, along with selected AP courses. Its faculty holds at least a master's degree and a number with PhDs.\n\nACS Athens alumni include actor Greg Kinnear, producer Mark Wolper, astronaut Scott Parazynski, basketball player Rony Seikaly, and Congressman Jim Moody.\n\n"}

{"id": "1797237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797237", "title": "Bath (UK Parliament constituency)", "text": "Bath (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nBath is a constituency in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom represented by Wera Hobhouse of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nPerhaps its best-known representatives have been the two with international profiles: William Pitt the Elder (Prime Minister 1766–1768) and Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong (1992-1997).\n\nBath is an ancient constituency which has been constantly represented in Parliament since boroughs were first summoned to send members in the 13th century.\n\nBath was one of the cities summoned to send members in 1295 and represented ever since, although Parliaments in early years were sporadic. Like almost all English constituencies before the Great Reform Act of 1832, it originally returned two members to each Parliament.\n\nThe precise way in which Bath's MPs were chosen in the Middle Ages is unknown. It is recorded that \"\"election was by the Mayor and three citizens being sent from thence to the county court who in the name of the whole community, and by the assent of the community, returned their representatives\"\"; but whether the \"assent of the community\" was real or what form it took is unrecorded, even assuming it was not a completely dead letter. By the 17th century, elections had become more competitive, as the means of election in Bath had become a franchise restricted to the Mayor, Aldermen, and members of the Common Council (the City Corporation), a total of thirty voters. The freemen of the city challenged this state of affairs in 1661 and again in 1705, claiming the right to vote and petitioning against the election of the candidates chosen by the corporation, but on both occasions the House of Commons, which at the time was still the final arbiter of such disputes, decided against them. The Commons resolution of 27 January 1708, \"\"That the right of election of citizens to serve in Parliament for this city is in the mayor, aldermen and common-council only\"\", settled the matter until 1832.\n\nBath was the most populous of the English boroughs where the right to vote was restricted to the corporation. At the time of the 1801 census, it was one of the ten largest towns or cities in England by population, and was almost unique in that the voters generally exercised their powers independently. As was the case elsewhere, the Common Council was not popularly elected, all vacancies being filled by co-option by the existing members, so that once a united interest had gained majority control it was easy to retain it. Most corporation boroughs quickly became pocket boroughs in this way, the nomination of their members of parliament being entirely decided by a \"patron\" who may have given some large benefaction to the area or simply used bribery to ensure only his supporters or croneys became members of the corporation. But in Bath, the Common Council retained its independence in most periods and took pride in electing two suitable members of parliament who had either strong local connections or else a national reputation. Nor was there any suggestion of bribery or other corruption, prolific in other \"independent\" constituencies. Pitt the Elder wrote to the corporation in 1761, on the occasion of his re-election as one of Bath's members, to pay tribute to \"\"a city ranked among the most ancient and most considerable in the kingdom, and justly famed for its integrity, independence, and zeal for the public good\"\".\n\nBut even in Bath the limited electorate who voted for its members of parliament expected them to work to procure favours for their constituents and enterprises to a degree that would be considered corrupt today. By exercising efforts successfully in this direction, the representatives could in return expect a degree of influence over the voters that differed little from patronage in the pocket boroughs, except that its duration was limited. Thus the lawyer Robert Henley, a Bath MP from 1747 and also Recorder of Bath from 1751, seems to have been assumed to have control over both seats while he held one of them and immediately after; yet when he gained a peerage and thus a seat in the House of Lords, Pitt replaced him on the understanding of being independently chosen. Pitt himself then acquired similar influence: the Council vetoed Viscount Ligonier's suggestion that he should be succeeded by his nephew when he was elevated the Lords in 1763, but instead allowed Pitt to nominate a candidate to be his new colleague, and voted overwhelmingly for him when he was opposed by a local man. But Pitt's influence also waned when he fell out with the Council over the Treaty of Paris later in 1763.\n\nIn the final years before the Reform Act, however, local magnates exerted a more controlling influence in Bath. Oldfield, writing early in the 19th century, stated that at that time the Marquess of Bath nominated one member and John Palmer the other; both were former members of parliament for the City (Lord Bath having sat as Viscount Weymouth, before his father's death took him to the Lords), but neither was then in the Commons – each had a relation sitting as one of the members for Bath. Palmer had succeeded Earl Camden who held one of the two seats before 1802. At the time of the Reform Act, the Lord Bath was still being listed as influencing one of the seats, although the second was considered independent once more.\n\nThe Great Reform Act opened up the franchise to all resident (male) householders whose houses had a value of at least £10 a year and imposed uniform voting provisions for all the boroughs. Bath was one of the boroughs which continued to elect two members. Given the city's medium size and its generally high property values, its electorate increased by a factor of almost 100, from 30 in 1831 to 2,853 in 1832, and created a competitive and generally marginal constituency which swung between Whig and Tory (later Liberal and Conservative) control. The parliamentary borough's boundaries were also slightly extended, but only to take in those areas into which the built-up area of the city had expanded. Bath's most notable member during this period was probably the Conservative social reformer Lord Ashley, better remembered under his eventual title of 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, for the Factory Acts, the first of which came into effect while he was one of the MPs for Bath.\n\nThe franchise was further reformed in 1867 and 1885 with only minor boundary changes. Bath was lucky to retain its two-member representation in the 1885 reforms, as its electorate of under 7,000 was near the lower limit, and this situation lasted until the 1918 reforms. The continued Liberal strength was unusual for a prosperous and predominantly middle-class town, and the seats could until 1918 not be considered safe for the Conservatives.\n\nBath's representation was reduced to a single member in 1918. The Conservatives held the seat continuously until 1992, except in the 1923 Parliament, and until World War II generally won comfortably – the Liberals retained such strength that the non-Conservative vote was split, and Labour could not rise above third place until the landslide of 1945, when the Conservative James Pitman achieved a very marginal majority. From 1945 to 1970, Labour presented the main challenge, and came within 800 votes of taking the seat in 1966.\n\nThe Liberal revival in the 1970s saw the two more left-wing parties swap places, helped by the adoption of a nationally known candidate, Christopher Mayhew, who had defected from the Labour Party. The formation of the SDP–Liberal Alliance made Bath a realistic target. The SDP came 1500 votes from winning in 1987 under Malcolm Dean. In 1992, Conservative Chris Patten was ousted by Liberal Democrat Don Foster in a narrow defeat widely blamed on Patten's strategising, campaign leading and communicating as Conservative Party chairman rather than canvassing his own constituents. At each election from 1992 to 2015, a different Conservative candidate contested the constituency.\n\nThe boundary changes implemented in 1997 took Bathampton, Batheaston, Bathford, Charlcombe and Freshford from the Wansdyke district, containing about 7,000 voters; these were moved elsewhere in 2010. Nominally, these areas had a slightly higher tendency to prefer a Conservative candidate but, the national government suffering from sleaze, in 1997 Don Foster more than doubled his almost 4,000 vote majority to over 9,000 votes. After winning two intervening elections, in 2010 Foster achieved his highest majority to date of 11,883 votes.\n\nIn the 2015 general election, following the national Liberal Democrat collapse and Foster standing down, the seat was regained by the Conservatives under Ben Howlett with a 3,833-vote majority.\n\nBath is estimated to have voted to remain in the European Union by 68.3% in the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.\n\nIn the 2017 general election, the constituency was regained by the Liberal Democrats' Wera Hobhouse, with the second-highest Liberal Democrat vote share increase nationally (after Richmond Park).\n\nBath is one of only two UK Parliament constituencies to be surrounded by another constituency. Bath is entirely surrounded by the North East Somerset constituency. The other constituency, York Central, is entirely surrounded by York Outer.\n\nFollowing the review of the constituencies in the former county of Avon carried out by the Boundary Commission for England, as of the 2010 general election the constituency covers only the city of Bath, and none of the surrounding rural area. Between 1997 and 2010, it also included some outlying villages such as Southstoke and Freshford now in the North East Somerset constituency. The changes in 2010 also resulted in Bath becoming a borough constituency, instead of a county constituency as it was before. In 2019 prior to the local elections, the Abbey Ward was abolished and became part of the Kingsmead ward, the Oldfield Park ward saw the creation of the Moorland ward.\n\nThe constituency's electoral wards are:\n\n\nThe current Member of Parliament is Wera Hobhouse of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nWilliam Pitt the Elder was briefly Prime Minister from 30 July 1766 while a Bath MP ending when on 4 August 1766 he was raised to the peerage as Earl of Chatham.\n\n\nThis was the largest Lib Dem majority (by percentage) and the second largest by number at the 2019 General Election.\n\nGeneral Election 1939/40:\n\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1940.

Playing the right wing position, he played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1988 to 2003 with the Detroit Red Wings, New Jersey Devils, Dallas Stars and Montreal Canadiens. He was commonly referred to as Randy \"The Rocket\" Mckay\" for not only his physical playstyle and consistent double digit goal seasons, but also most notably for his \"head high screamers\" or hard slapshots into the upper corner of the net.\n\nMcKay was selected by the Detroit Red Wings in the sixth round, 113th overall, of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. He split the 1987–88, 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons between the Red Wings and their affiliate in the American Hockey League (AHL), the Adirondack Red Wings. McKay stuck with the Wings in the NHL for the 1990–91 season, appearing in 47 games. While showing a scoring touch in the AHL, McKay only scored 4 goals in 83 total games with the Red Wings and was unable to find consistent playing time. Following the season, McKay and Dave Barr were sent by rule of an arbitrator to the New Jersey Devils as compensation for the Red Wings' signing of free agent Troy Crowder. The deal did not work out for the Wings as Crowder only played in seven games for the team before incurring a serious injury. McKay developed into a solid third and fourth line player that the Wings would later covet in the latter part of the decade. It was a move that Red Wings senior vice president Jim Devellano resisted at the time and regretted later.\n\nAlthough a physical presence on the ice, McKay also contributed offensively, with double-digit goal totals and a positive plus/minus most seasons (including +30 in 1997–98, fourth in the NHL). He is perhaps best remembered among Devils fans for scoring the winning goal in Game 6 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Finals against the Philadelphia Flyers; the Devils won the game 4–2 and went on to win their first Stanley Cup by upsetting the heavily-favoured Detroit Red Wings in four games.\n\nOn October 28, 2000, in a regular season game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, McKay and teammate John Madden each scored four goals in a 9–0 win for the Devils. It was the first time since 1922 that two teammates each scored four goals.\n\nMcKay was also a member of the Devils when they won the Stanley Cup in 2000 against the Dallas Stars in six games.\n\nOn March 19, 2002, McKay was traded (alongside Jason Arnott and a first-round pick in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft) to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner.\n\nMcKay retired after the 2002–03 season, finishing his career in his hometown as a member of the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nFor a period of time with the New Jersey Devils, McKay was a member of \"The Crash Line\" alongside Bobby Holík and Mike Peluso. Head coach Jacques Lemaire created the line to counter the larger skilled players of the Eastern Conference at the time, including Eric Lindros, Cam Neely and Jaromír Jágr. The average weight of the linemates was 215 pounds, and each skater played a physical and aggressive style of hockey. The trio were part of the Devils Stanley Cup championship in 1995. Following the departure of Peluso, Holík and McKay often remained on the same line, which sometimes included Sergei Brylin.\n\nMcKay is a graduate of Michigan Technological University (1984–1988). \n\nMcKay splits time between Houghton, Michigan and Marquette, Michigan as has four children: Riley, Kaitlyn, Dawson and McKenna.\n\n"}

Corran knows that he is Force-sensitive, and that only with the Force as his ally can he track down his enemy.\n\nIt turns out that Corran's wife, Mirax, was tracking down a group of elusive pirates known as the Invids. The Invids' primary tactic is to drop out of hyperspace with the flagship, an Imperial Star Destroyer named the \"Invidious\", strike, and disappear with perfect timing. As she grew closer to solving the mystery of how these pirates performed their supernaturally accurate attacks, she was kidnapped and placed into stasis on their fortress planet.

By 1334, they were settled at Lleweni.\n\nThomas Salusbury fought at the Battle of Blackheath (1497) and was knighted by Henry VII and appointed steward of the Lordship of Denbigh.\n\nAfter the establishment of Henry VIII as the new King of England, the Crown began to favour Welshmen for positions at court allowing for the creation of Salusbury Road in Queen's Park. During the reign of Elizabeth I, the family developed a passion for supporting the arts. During this time Lleweni Hall, the family's seat, expanded greatly after Sir John Salusbury was appointed the Custos Rotulorum of Denbighshire. Sir John, who was knighted in 1601, also had the distinction of being the dedicatee of Shakespeare's \"The Phoenix and the Turtle\" after Salusbury became his patron.\n\nSir John's brother, Thomas Salusbury, was executed for his involvement in the Babington Plot in 1586, and a cousin Owen Salusbury was killed while fighting for Essex during the Essex Rebellion of 1601. Sir John, however, supported the Queen at this critical juncture and was knighted shortly afterwards. Fighting as a Royalist during the English Civil War, Henry Salusbury, the second son of Sir John Salusbury, received a baronetcy on 10 November 1619 during the reign of James I for his father's contributions to the Crown.\n\nAfter the Restoration, the family fortunes began to decline. John Salusbury went on a long and ultimately failed expedition of Nova Scotia. He had one daughter, Hester Piozzi, who had twelve children by her first husband Henry Thrale, of whom four daughters survived, the eldest being Hester Maria Elphinstone, Viscountess Keith.\n\nIn 1648, after the death of Sir John Salusbury, the family had a lack of male heirs. The Salusbury family was revived after Hester Piozzi (born Salusbury) adopted John Salusbury Piozzi Salusbury, the Italian nephew of her Milanese husband. Therefore, the ancient and modern family are unrelated in blood. Around this time, the seat of the Salusbury family moved from Lleweni Hall to Brynbella. John Salusbury Piozzi Salusbury is the progenitor of the modern Salusbury family, and all people who possess the right to bear the Salusbury arms are descended from him.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The line is part of Network Rail Strategic Route 7, SRS 07.06, and is classified as a London and South-East commuter line.\n\nThe stations and all services are currently operated by Greater Anglia. As of 2019 the typical off-peak weekday service-frequency is one train per hour in each direction. The timetabled journey time between Witham and Braintree is 16 minutes.\n\nOriginally constructed from Maldon to via , only the line from Braintree to Witham remains open. The line was proposed by the Maldon, Witham & Braintree Railway (MWBR) and given royal assent in June 1846. The MWBR was subsequently purchased by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR), and the line opened in 1848.\n\nThe section from Maldon to Witham was constructed as double-track, however one track was lifted during the period of the Crimean War (1854-56) and sold to the War Office.\n\nThe Bishop's Stortford–Braintree branch line, built by the Great Eastern Railway (GER), was opened in 1869. This created a route from Maldon through to the West Anglia Main Line.\n\nThe line was extended from Maldon to Woodham Ferrers in 1889.\n\nIn 1923, both lines became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).\n\nDuring the Second World War passenger services on the section between and Woodham Ferrers were withdrawn and never reinstated.\n\nThe Bishop's Stortford–Braintree branch closed to passenger traffic in 1952 and then to freight in 1971. The section from Maldon East and Heybridge to Witham was closed to passengers following the Beeching cuts to the railways in 1964, although goods services on that section continued until 1966.\n\nThe franchise for the line is currently held by Greater Anglia.\n\nThe line is single-track throughout and the route is electrified at 25 kV AC.

Eleventh Avenue originates in the Meatpacking District in the Greenwich Village and West Village neighborhoods at Gansevoort Street, where Eleventh Avenue, Tenth Avenue, and West Street intersect. It is considered part of the West Side Highway between 22nd and Gansevoort Streets.\n\nBetween 59th and 107th Streets, the avenue is known as West End Avenue. Both West End Avenue and Eleventh Avenue are considered to be part of the same road.\n\nBetween Gansevoort Street and West 22nd Street, Eleventh Avenue is part of the West Side Highway, a very wide expressway. At a split with Twelfth Avenue/West Side Highway at West 22nd Street, Eleventh Avenue continues as a standard-width avenue.\n\nFollowing the split, Eleventh Avenue is two-way traffic for access to 23rd Street, as well as for 24th Street to access Chelsea Piers. North of 24th Street, Eleventh Avenue is one-way southbound from 24th to 34th Streets, where two-way traffic resumes for access to the Lincoln Tunnel. The segment between approximately 39th and 59th Streets is home to the largest concentration of auto dealerships in Manhattan. Eleventh Avenue again becomes one-way southbound between 40th and 57th Streets; two-way traffic resumes north of 57th Street.\n\nThe portion north of 59th Street is called West End Avenue, which has mixed commercial and residential use. The northern are a sedate Upper West Side residential street ending at Straus Park, 107th Street, and Broadway. Traffic is bidirectional, except for the northernmost block, north of 106th Street.\n\nThe West Side Line of the New York Central Railroad once had on-street running along part of Eleventh Avenue, which, along with Tenth Avenue, become known as \"Death Avenue\" because of the large number of deaths that occurred due to train–pedestrian collisions. In 1929, the city, the state, and New York Central agreed on the West Side Improvement Project, conceived by Robert Moses), allocated funds for an elevated railway which would eliminate the grade crossings and alleviate the problems along Tenth and Eleventh Avenues; it also included construction of the West Side Elevated Highway.\n\nMeanwhile, the avenue's West End Avenue section was originally created in the 1880s as the northern extension of Eleventh Avenue, and was intended to be a commercial street serving the residents of the mansions to be constructed along Riverside Drive. When West End Avenue was named in the 1880s, the Upper West Side was fairly sparsely populated, and that upper portion of the avenue, subsequently, was called the \"West End\" because of its separation from the core of the city. Seeking to distinguish the area from the factories and tenements below 59th Street, a group of real estate developers renamed the northern portions of the West Side's avenues.\n\nPortions of both West End Avenue and Eleventh Avenue were run down in the mid-20th century, with single room occupancy hotels, prostitutes and drug addicts a common sight. The city's economic comeback in the 1980s brought recovery and gentrification.\n\nThe upper portion of the avenue retains stretches of late nineteenth-century town houses and several handsome churches and synagogues, but is almost entirely made up of handsome residential buildings about twelve stories tall built in the first decades of the twentieth century. The near total absence of retail on that part of the street marks its quiet, residential character, as opposed to the high-traffic, noisy character of Eleventh Avenue.\n\nThe architecture of buildings on Eleventh and West End Avenues differs significantly. West End Avenue is noteworthy for its almost unbroken street wall of handsome apartment buildings punctuated by brief stretches of nineteenth-century townhouses and several handsome churches and synagogues. Notable architecturally historicist houses of worship include:\n\nAmong the more notable apartment buildings are:\n\nEleventh Avenue, meanwhile, is lined with new-age residential buildings – such as 100 Eleventh Avenue – adjacent to warehouses and car dealerships.\n\nBetween 34th and 59th Streets there are a number of new car dealerships including: Audi Manhattan, BMW of Manhattan, Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep-Ram Manhattan, Jaguar-Land Rover Manhattan, Lexus of Manhattan, Manhattan Motorcars, Mercedes-Benz Manhattan, Mini of Manhattan, Open Road Volkswagen, Potamkin Cadillac, Toyota of Manhattan, and Volvo Cars Manhattan. Additionally, numerous vehicle service stations, car washes, and car rental lots are found along this stretch.\n\nThis area has served the transport trade for more than a hundred years; most of the stables for New York's remaining horse cabs are located on its side streets, though many now store taxis and pedicabs. It is not uncommon to hear the clip clop of horses in the vicinity, as a result. The carriage horses live in historic stables originally built in the 19th century, but today boast the latest in barn design, such as fans, misting systems, box stalls, and state-of-the-art sprinkler systems. As horses always have in densely populated urban areas, the carriage horses live upstairs in their stables while the carriages are parked below on the ground floor.\n\nOne historic district lies on Eleventh Avenue, the West Chelsea Historic District, designated in 2008.\n\nTwo segments of West End Avenue lie within designated New York City historic districts: both sides of the avenue from West 87th to West 94th Streets can be found in the Riverside-West End Historic District. The west side of the avenue from West 75th Street through mid-block between West 78th and West 79th streets and the east side between West 76th and West 77th streets are contained within the West End-Collegiate Historic District. Concern over building demolition filings for the demolition of three row houses and a six-story elevator apartment building at the southwest corner of West End Avenue and West 86th Streets spurred a grassroots effort to seek historic district designation for the entire stretch north of Lincoln Towers from West 70th to West 107th streets. On March 18, 2009, the West End Avenue Preservation Society formally submitted a request for evaluation to the chair of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission along with a 260-page survey prepared by Andrew Dolkart.\n\nPoints of interest on or within one block of Eleventh Avenue include:\n\nPoints of interest on or within one block of West End Avenue include:\n\nEleventh Avenue has been served by the New York City Subway's , built as part of the 7 Subway Extension, at a station under the avenue at 34th Street, since September 2015.\n\nThe New York City Bus's route has served the avenue since September 2014; plans for the bus route were formulated in early 2014.\n\nNotable current and former residents include:\n\n"}

After moving a number of times during his childhood, Lessard and his family eventually settled in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1987. They had previously lived from 1980–84 in Buckingham County, Virginia and in Richmond, Virginia from 1984–86.\n\nAfter moving back to Charlottesville from Madison, Wi. in 1987, he enrolled in the Tandem School, where he studied music under trumpeter John D'earth and bassist Peter Spaar. D'earth and Spaar recommended Lessard to Dave Matthews for inclusion in his new band, which was looking for a bassist. Lessard joined Dave Matthews Band just as it was forming, when he was sixteen years old. Due to his age, he sometimes had to sneak in the back door of the clubs where the band was playing due to prohibitions on persons under 21 entering venues that serve alcohol.\n\nLessard completed his junior year of high school then took the GED (summer of '91) as he had already been accepted at Richmond's Virginia Commonwealth University in their Jazz Studies program. He left after six weeks, when it became evident that he could not be a full-time college student and simultaneously a touring member of a band with rising popularity.\n\nIn 2006, Lessard began maintaining a MySpace page called LowenDude. He also owns and maintains a blog at izstyle.com. During the 2007 European Tour, Lessard also began a video blog on YouTube.\n\nOn January 9, 2008, Lessard performed with members of Guster and Barenaked Ladies under the name Yukon Kornelius in a benefit concert sponsored by Okemo Mountain Resort, a ski resort in Vermont. Later that year, he co-wrote the original music for \"\". \n\nLessard married long-time girlfriend Josie Baucom in 1997. They had one son together, Elijah \"Diggy\" Diego (born January 9, 1998) and lost a daughter, Aslan, to SIDS in 1996. They divorced in 2004.\n\nIn October 2005 he married Jaclyn Burton, and together they have three daughters, Hazel Bailey (born March 6, 2004), Flora Jude (born July 13, 2006), and India (born November 2015).\n\nOn November 29, 2007, Lessard's home in western Albemarle County, Virginia, burned down, with a loss estimated at over 2 million dollars. It took over 40 firefighters from five different fire departments to extinguish the blaze. The origin of the fire is unknown, but the Albemarle County Fire Marshal's Office cites the structure's cedar shake siding as a contributor to the rapid spread of the fire. Lessard and his son were home at the time of the fire, though they escaped unharmed.\n\nLessard plays a variety of bass guitars, including those made by Nordstrand, Modulus, Warwick, Ken Smith Basses, and hand-made Stambaugh Custom Basses. On the Dave Matthews Band album \"Busted Stuff,\" he plays piano, Hammond organ, and Dobro guitar.\n\nBootleg Hunington Series\n\n"}

For example, at T ∼ 1200 K the carbon content of the residue exceeds a mass fraction of 90 wt.%, whereas at T ∼ 1600 K more than 99 wt.% carbon is found.\nCarbonization is often exothermic, which means that it could in principle be made self-sustaining and be used as a source of energy that does not produce carbon dioxide. (See.) In the case of glucose, the reaction releases about 237 calories per gram.\n\nWhen biomaterial is exposed to sudden searing heat (as in the case of a nuclear explosion or pyroclastic flow from a volcano, for instance), it can be carbonized extremely quickly, turning it into solid carbon. In the destruction of Herculaneum by a volcano, many organic objects such as furniture were carbonized by the intense heat.\n\nThe carbonization of wood in an industrial setting usually requires a temperature above 280 °C, which liberates energy and hence this reaction is said to be exothermic. This carbonization, which can also be seen as a spontaneous breakdown of the wood, continues until only the carbonised residue called charcoal remains. Unless further external heat is provided, the process stops and the temperature reaches a maximum of about 400 °C. This charcoal, however, will still contain appreciable amounts of tarry residue, together with the ash of the original wood.\n\nCarbonization produces substances which can prove harmful and simple precautions should be taken to reduce risks.\n\nThe gas produced by carbonization has a high content of carbon monoxide which is poisonous when breathed. Therefore, when working around the kiln or pit during operation and when the kiln is opened for unloading, care must be taken that proper ventilation is provided to allow the carbon monoxide, which is also produced during unloading through spontaneous ignition of the hot fuel, to be dispersed.\n\nThe tars and smoke produced from carbonization, although not directly poisonous, may have long-term damaging effects on the respiratory system. Housing areas should, where possible, be located so that prevailing winds carry smoke from charcoal operations away from them and batteries of kilns should not be located in close proximity to housing areas.\n\nWood tars and pyroligneous acid can be irritant to skin and care should be taken to avoid prolonged skin contact by providing protective clothing and adopting working procedures which minimize exposure.\n\nThe tars and pyroligneous liquors can also seriously contaminate streams and affect drinking water supplies for humans and animals. Fish may also be adversely affected. Liquid effluents and waste water from medium and large scale charcoal operations should be trapped in large settling ponds and allowed to evaporate so that this water does not pass into the local drainage system and contaminate streams. Kilns and pits, as distinct from retorts and other sophisticated systems, do not normally produce liquid effluent - the by-products are mostly dispersed into the air as vapours. Precautions against airborne contamination of the environment are of greater importance in this case.\n\nIn one study, carbonization was used to create a new catalyst for the generation of biodiesel from ethanol and fatty acids. The catalyst was created by carbonization of simple sugars such as glucose and sucrose. The sugars were processed for 15 hours at 400 °C under a nitrogen flow to a black carbon residue consisting of a complex mixture of polycyclic aromatic carbon sheets. This material was then treated with sulfuric acid, which functionalized the sheets with sulfonite, carboxyl, and hydroxyl catalytic sites.\n\n\n"}

In some cases, the gambling is limited to slot machines, but many locations are beginning to include table games such as blackjack, poker, and roulette.\n\nIn 2003, Joe Bob Briggs described the economic motivation of race track owners to convert into racinos:\n\n\"USA Today\" noted in a June 2003 article that receipts from slot machines are divided about evenly in four ways:\n\nAs of 2013, racinos are legal in ten U.S. states: Delaware, Louisiana, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. The first racino in Pennsylvania opened in November 2006. West Virginia pioneered the concept when MTR Gaming Group was allowed to introduce video lottery terminals (VLTs) to the venue now known as Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort in Chester. Delaware, Rhode Island, and West Virginia, three of the members of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), jointly ran a progressive VLT game, Ca$hola, from 2006 to July 2011; the three lotteries began offering Ca$hola's successor, \"MegaHits\", on July 15, 2011.\n\nWhile VLTs were somewhat successful, a November 2003 article from the \"Global Gaming Insider\" noted the real financial success story was the introduction of reel spinning slot machines in Iowa:\n\nAs the racino had increased revenues, horse racing purses increased six-fold, which attracted better horses to the racetrack and helped to develop horse breeding in Iowa.\n\nThe \"Global Gaming Insider\" article also noted that the creation of the racino has led to consolidation in the ownership of racetracks, with Magna Entertainment Corporation (currently Stronach Group) and Churchill Downs Incorporated the largest.\n\nIn November 2004, Florida voters amended their state constitution to allow slot machines at parimutuel facilities.\n\nIn Bangor, Maine, a $131 million complex is under construction that will house, among other things, a gaming floor featuring up to 1,500 slot machines, a seven-story hotel, and a four-level parking garage. The new racino is slated to open in the summer of 2008. In Biddeford, Maine on November 2, 2010 by a vote of 59%-41% approved a referendum to relocate Scarborough Downs to Biddeford with a new Harness Racing Track/Racino Complex with Slot Machines, an Entertainment Complex and a 200 room Hotel. The plan is to have most if not all of the complex open sometime in 2012. Maine voters also approved the Oxford County Maine casino on Nov 2, 2010 also, the indications are that the Bangor Maine Racino and the possibly relocated Scarborough Downs Racino facility could also have table games as well.\n\nThere are two racino-like facilities in Arkansas.

Formed in the late 1890s by \"Circular Jack\", \"Kid Yorke\", and \"Goo Goo Knox\", the gang began operating from an apartment house on Hudson Street. Knox, a former member of the Gopher Gang, had fled after a failed attempt to gain leadership of the gang from then-leader Marty Brennan. However the two gangs later became allies during the gang wars against Gay Nineties gangs, the Potashes and Boodle Gangs, soon controlling most of Manhattan's West Side as far as 13th Street and eastern Broadway, bordering Paul Kelly's Five Points Gang to the north. While the gang dominated the West Side, it constantly battled smaller rival gangs including the Fashion Plates, the Pearl Buttons, and the Marginals for control of the Hudson River docks throughout the 1900s. Eventually, it drove the rival gangs out through sheer force of numbers, with over 200 members, not including the Gophers, who numbered several hundred more, controlling the waterfront by 1910. \n\nThe gang, now a dominant force in New York, included the likes of Charles \"Red\" Farrell, Mike Costello, \"Rubber\" Shaw, Rickey Harrison, and \"Honey\" Stewart. The gang became involved in election fraud as they were hired out by Tammany Hall politicians in exchange for political protection. A colorful member by the name of Ding Dong organized a push cart theft ring whereby he had a group of apprentice gang members toss packages to him from a passing wagon, distracting the police. Soon the gang began to be noticed by the press as reporters met members in Greenwich Village tavern hangouts, becoming glamorized by the city. They came to represent the bohemian spirit of the area. According to author Luc Sante, activist Dorothy Day, by her own admission, spent much of her youth partying with the Dusters in Greenwich Village. Many of the gang's members, including most of its leaders, had become drug addicts and were known for their wild \"cocaine parties\" in which the gang wandered the city afterwards in a drugged state committing violent acts. One victim of these attacks was Gopher member Owney Madden, who was shot six times outside the Arbor Dance Hall on November 6, 1914, resulting in the deaths of three of the gang members less than a week later. With the gang's political connections to Tammany Hall, the police remained inactive. However, the gang frequently moved its headquarters to avoid police raids by \"strong arm squads\". \n\nThe gang, which regularly demanded goods from local merchants, soon attracted the unwanted attention of the police after an incident in which the gang destroyed a saloon after its owner refused to deliver six barrels of beer to a gang party. The saloon keeper reported this to his friend Dennis Sullivan, a patrolman from the Charles Street station, who arrested Farrell and ten other members at a local pool hall for vagrancy. The gang retaliated, luring Sullivan into the neighborhood onto the premises of a local merchant, who had been forced to make a complaint against a member of the gang. When Sullivan arrived he was attacked by approximately twenty members and severely beaten, eventually losing consciousness. He was stripped of his uniform and his badge was thrown into a sewer drain. As the gang fled, five members remained behind to jump on Sullivan's back and to kick him in the face repeatedly before a police \"flying squad\" arrived. Hospitalized for over a month the incident was immortalized in a poem by Gopher leader \"One Leg\" Curran:\n\nThe gang liked the poem so much they had it printed on thousands of sheets and distributed throughout the neighborhood as well as the Charles Street Station and the hospital where Sullivan was recovering. The song grew to be so popular that many juvenile gangs would often sing the tune on the street.\n\nBy 1914 however, with most of its leaders in jail or dead from drug overdoses, the remainder of the gang were driven from their territory by the Marginals under Tanner Smith, who after defeating the Pearl Buttons would assume control for the next decade. The last members of the gang were eventually arrested by police during their clearing of gangs from Manhattan in 1916.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in York, in August 1820.\n\nThough only 24, in August 1844 Middleton gained his first contract and was asked to design Cleveland Lodge, an impressive mansion situated directly beneath Roseberry Topping. He was then employed as a retained architect for the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR), and built stations and railway buildings for a number of lines, including the Wear and Derwent Junction Railway (1845), the Middlesbrough and Redcar Railway (1846) and finally the recently re-opened Weardale Railway (1847).\n\nHe moved to Cheltenham in 1859 where he designed five Anglican churches, which were All Saints', Holy Apostles, St. Mark's, St. Philip & St. James and St. Stephen's Churches. This move to Cheltenham brought Middleton to the attention of a number of landed gentry in Wales. It was Middleton who designed the Cilgwyn Mansion in Newcastle Emlyn for the Fitzwilliam family in 1884 and it was at Cilgwyn that he died in 1885. It is said locally that his death occurred at the mansion whilst disputing some aspect of the building work on the mansion. It was also Middleton's company that was contracted to build the Canterbury building at the University of Wales, Lampeter, though this was opened in 1887, and as such it is unlikely that Middleton had a great deal direct input on this building, since he died in Wales in 1885.\n\nMiddleton married Maria Margaret Pritchett, daughter of James Pigott Pritchett, architect of York, and his first wife Peggy Maria Terry. Their only surviving child John Henry Middleton (1846–1896) was appointed director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1893.\n\n"}
{"id": "1797388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797388", "title": "Glycerophospholipid", "text": "Glycerophospholipid\n\nGlycerophospholipids or phosphoglycerides are glycerol-based phospholipids. They are the main component of biological membranes.\n\nThe term glycerophospholipid signifies any derivative of glycerophosphoric acid that contains at least one O-acyl, or O-alkyl, or O-alk-1'- enyl residue attached to the glycerol moiety.\n\nThe alcohol here is glycerol, to which two fatty acids and a phosphoric acid are attached as esters. The two fatty acid chains attached to the molecule of glycerol are nonpolar hence hydrophobic while the polar heads which mainly consists of the phosphate group attached to the third carbon of the glycerol molecule is hydrophilic. This dual characteristic leads to the amphipathic nature of glycerophospholipids. They are usually organized into a bilayer in membranes with the polar hydrophillic heads sticking outwards to the aqueous environment and the non polar hydrophobic tails pointing inwards. Glycerophospholipids consists of various diverse species which usually differ slightly in structure. The most basic structure is a phosphatidate. This species is an important intermediate in the synthesis of many phosphoglycerides. The presence of an additional group attached to the phosphate allows for many different phosphoglycerides.\n\nBy convention, structures of these compounds show the 3 glycerol carbon atoms vertically with the phosphate attached to carbon atom number three (at the bottom). Plasmalogens and phosphatidates are examples.\n\nIn general, glycerophospholipids use a \"sn\" notation, which stands for stereospecific numbering. When the letters \"sn\" appear in the nomenclature, by convention the hydroxyl group of the second carbon of glycerol (sn-2) is on the left on a Fischer projection. The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being sn-1 the carbon at the top and sn-3 the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial conformation (R or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the sn1 and/or sn3 position. Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the sn-2, with unsaturated fatty acids in the sn1 and/or sn3 position.\n\nPlasmalogens are a type of phosphoglyceride. The first carbon of glycerol has a hydrocarbon chain attached via an ether, not ester, linkage. The linkages are more resistant to chemical attack than ester linkages are. The second (central) carbon atom has a fatty acid linked by an ester. The third carbon links to an ethanolamine or choline by means of a phosphate ester. These compounds are key components of the membranes of muscles and nerves.\n\nPhosphatidates are lipids in which the first two carbon atoms of the glycerol are fatty acid esters, and the 3 is a phosphate ester. The phosphate serves as a link to another alcohol-usually ethanolamine, choline, serine, or a carbohydrate. The identity of the alcohol determines the subcategory of the phosphatidate. There is a negative charge on the phosphate and, in the case of choline or serine, a positive quaternary ammonium ion. (Serine also has a negative carboxylate group.) The presence of charges give a \"head\" with an overall charge. The phosphate ester portion (\"head\") is hydrophilic, whereas the remainder of the molecule, the fatty acid \"tail\", is hydrophobic. These are important components for the formation of lipid bilayers.\n\nPhosphatidylethanoamines, phosphatidylcholines, and other phospholipids are examples of phosphatidates.\n\nPhosphatidylcholines are lecithins. Choline is the alcohol, with a positively charged quaternary ammonium, bound to the phosphate, with a negative charge. Lecithins are present in all living organisms. An egg yolk has a high concentration of lecthins- which are commercially important as an emulsifying agent in products such as mayonnaise. Lecithins are also present in brain and nerve tissue.\n\nThere are many other phospholipids, some of which are glycolipids. The glycolipids include phosphatidyl sugars where the alcohol functional group is part of a carbohydrate. Phosphatidyl sugars are present in plants and certain microorganisms. A carbohydrate is very hydrophilic due to the large number of hydroxyl groups present.\n\nOne of the main functions of glycerophospholipid is to serve as a structural component of biological membranes. Their amphipathic nature drives the formation of the lipid bilayer structure of membranes. The cell membrane seen under the electron microscope consists of two identifiable layers, or \"leaflets\", each of which is made up of an ordered row of glycerophospholipid molecules. The composition of each layer can vary widely depending on the type of cell. \n\nEach glycerophospholipid molecule consists of a small polar head group and two long hydrophobic chains. In the cell membrane, the two layers of phospholipids are arranged as follows:\n\nThis is a stable structure because the ionic hydrophilic head groups interact with the aqueous media inside and outside the cell, whereas the hydrophobic tails maximize hydrophobic interactions with each other and are kept away from the aqueous environments. The overall result of this structure is to construct a fatty barrier between the cell's interior and its surroundings.\n\nApart from their function in cell memberanes, they function in other cellular processes such as signal induction and transport. In regards to signaling, they provide the precursors for prostanglandins and other leukotrienes. It is their specific distribution and catabolism that enables them carry out the biological response processes listed above. Their roles as storage centers for secondary messengers in the membrane is also a contributing factor to their ability to act as transporters. They also influence protein function. For example, they are important constituents of lipoproteins (soluble proteins that transport fat in the blood) hence affect their metabolism and function.\n\nGlycerophospholipids can also act as an emulsifying agent to promote dispersal of one substance into another. This is sometimes used in candy making and ice-cream making.\n\nNeural membranes contain several classes of glycerophospholipids which turnover at different rates with respect to their structure and localization in different cells and membranes. There are three major classes namely; 1-alkyl-2-acyl glycerophospholipid, 1,2-diacyl glycerophospholipid and plasmalogen. The main function of these classes of glycerophospholipids in the neural membranes is to provide stability, permeability and fluidity through specific alterations in their compositions. The glycerophospholipid composition of neural membranes greatly alters their functional efficacy. The length of glycerophospholipid acyl chain and the degree of saturation are important determinants of many membrane characteristics including the formation of lateral domains that are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Receptor-mediated degradation of glycerophospholipids by phospholipases A(l), A(2), C, and D results in generation of second messengers, such as prostaglandins, eicosanoids, platelet activating factor and diacylglycerol. Thus, neural membrane phospholipids are a reservoir for second messengers. They are also involved in apoptosis, modulation of activities of transporters, and membrane-bound enzymes. Marked alterations in neural membrane glycerophospholipid composition have been reported to occur in neurological disorders. These alterations result in changes in membrane fluidity and permeability. These processes along with the accumulation of lipid peroxides and compromised energy metabolism may be responsible for the neurodegeneration observed in neurological disorders.\n\nThe metabolism of glycerophospholipids is different in eukaryotes, tumor cells, and prokaryotes. Synthesis in prokaryotes involves the synthesis of glycerophospholipids phosphatidic acid and polar head groups. Phosphatidic acid synthesis in eukaryotes is different, there are two routes, one to the other toward phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Glycerophospholipids are generally metabolized in several steps with different intermediates. The very first step in this metabolism involves the addition or transfer of the fatty acid chains to the glycerol backbone to form the first intermediate, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA then becomes acylated to form the next intermediate phosphatidic acid (PA). PA can be dephosphorylated leading to the formation of diacylglycerol which is essential in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). PC is one of the many species of glycerophospholipids. In a pathway called the Kennedy pathway, the polar heads are added to complete the formation of the entire structure consisting of the polar head regions, the two fatty acid chains and the phosphate group attached to the glycerol backbone. In this Kennedy pathway, Choline is converted to CDP-Choline which drives the transfer of the polar head groups to complete the formation of PC. PC can then be further converted to other species of glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).\n\n\n"}

It is located within the Foro Italico sports complex, north of the city. The structure is owned by the Italian National Olympic Committee and it is used primarily for association football. The Stadio Olimpico is the home stadium of Roma and Lazio and also hosts the Coppa Italia final. It was rebuilt for the 1990 FIFA World Cup and it hosted the tournament final.\n\nRated an UEFA category four stadium, it has also hosted four European Cup finals, the most recent being the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final. Outside football, the stadium is used by the Italian national rugby union team and it is Italy's national athletics stadium. Occasionally, it hosts concerts and events.\n\nThroughout its history, the Stadio Olimpico has undergone several renovations.\n\nIn its first stages, the Stadio Olimpico was called the Stadio dei Cipressi. It was designed and constructed within the larger project of the \"Foro Mussolini\" (Mussolini Forum) which was renamed \"Foro Italico\" after the war.\n\nConstruction work began in 1927 directed by the Turinese engineer Angelo Frisa and architect Enrico Del Debbio. The construction was completed in 1932, after a few variations to the original plan. For instance, the construction of masonry stands was not part of the initial plan as, originally, stands consisted of grassed terraces.\n\nIn 1937, the construction of a second tier of stairs was started but was interrupted in 1940 due to the outbreak of World War II.\n\nIn December 1950, the working site was reopened for the completion of the stadium. The project was entrusted to the engineer Carlo Roccatelli, a member of the Superior Council of Public Works. At first, the plan was for a stadium with a more complex structure than that actually realised. However, the scarcity of funds and the environmental characteristics of the area led to a less ambitious building. On the death of Roccatelli in 1951, the direction of the work was entrusted to architect Annibale Vitellozzi. The stadium now reached a capacity of about 100,000 people, hence the stadium was known as Stadio dei Centomila, until renamed for the 1960 Olympics. The building was inaugurated on 17 May 1953 with a football game between Italy and Hungary.\n\nDuring the 1960 Summer Olympics, the stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and the athletics competitions. Seating at ground level was eliminated with the result of an actual capacity of 65,000 spectators. Subsequently, the stadium hosted several editions of the Italian Championships of Athletics, the 1975 Summer Universiade (the stadium was the only venue for the Universiade) and the 1987 World Athletics Championships. It still hosts the annual meeting of the Golden Gala.\n\nFor the 1990 FIFA World Cup, for which it was the main stadium, the facility underwent an extensive renovation. While that work was underway in 1989 the Capitoline teams Lazio and Roma had to play their Serie A games at Stadio Flaminio. The work was entrusted to a team of designers including the original architect Annibale Vitellozzi. From 1987 to 1990, the construction plan was amended several times, with a consequent rise in costs. Ultimately, the Olimpico was entirely demolished and rebuilt in reinforced concrete, with the exception of the \"Tribuna Tevere\" which was expanded with the addition of further steps and of the curves which were closer to the field by nine metres. All sectors of the stadium were provided with full coverage in tensostructure white. Backless seats in blue plastic were installed and two giant screens built in 1987 for the World Athletics Championships were also mounted inside the curve. In the end the new version of the Olimpico had 82,911 seats. It was the 14th stadium in the world for number of seats among the football stadiums, the 29th among all stadiums and the second in Italy, just behind the San Siro Stadium of Milan.\n\nThe Stadio Olimpico was host to five matches in which the Italian national team took part and the final between West Germany and Argentina. West Germany won the final match 1–0.\n\nWith the same layout from 1990, the Stadio Olimpico hosted on 22 May 1996 the UEFA Champions League Final between Juventus and Ajax which saw the \"Bianconeri\" prevail in a penalty shoot-out.\n\nIn 2007, a vast plan of restyling the internal design of the stadium was laid out, to conform to UEFA standards for the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final which was held in Rome. The work was performed and completed in 2008. It included the establishment of standard structures with improvements in security, the fixing of dressing rooms and of the press room. It also included the replacement of all seats, the installation of high definition LED screens, the partial removal of plexiglas fences between spectators and the field and a reduction of seating to the current capacity of 70,634. In order to enhance the comfort of the audience, part of the modernisation of the stadium involved increasing the number of restrooms and fixing the toilets. As a result of these improvements, the \"Stadio Olimpico was\" classified a UEFA Elite stadium.\n\nThe stadium has a current capacity of 72,698, distributed as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe average season attendance at league matches held at the Stadio Olimpico for Lazio and Roma.\n\n\"# In 1989–90 season both teams played at Stadio Flaminio during the renovations of Stadio Olimpico.\"<br>\n\"* Club was in Serie B\" <br>\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, and held six matches. The first five involved host nations Italy. All their Group A matches (1–0 wins over Austria 9 June and United States on 14 June respectively and a 2–0 win over Czechoslovakia on 19 June), their Round of 16 match against Uruguay on 26 June winning 2–0 and their Quarter-finals against Republic of Ireland on 30 June winning 1–0. The sixth was the Final where West Germany and Argentina on 8 July with West Germany winning 1–0.\n\n"}

{"id": "1797421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797421", "title": "Operation Deliberate Force", "text": "Operation Deliberate Force\n\nOperation Deliberate Force was a sustained air campaign conducted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), in concert with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) ground operations, to undermine the military capability of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS), which had threatened and attacked UN-designated \"safe areas\" in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War with the Srebrenica and Markale massacres, precipitating the intervention. The shelling of the Sarajevo market place on 28 August 1995 by the VRS is considered to be the immediate instigating factor behind NATO's decision to launch the operation.\n\nThe operation was carried out between 30 August and 20 September 1995, involving 400 aircraft and 5,000 personnel from 15 nations. Commanded by Admiral Leighton W. Smith Jr., the campaign struck 338 Bosnian Serb targets, many of which were destroyed. Overall, 1,026 bombs were dropped during the operation, 708 of which were precision-guided.\n\nThe bombing campaign was also roughly conterminous in time with Operation Mistral 2, two linked military offensives of the Croatian Army (HV), the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) launched in western Bosnia.\n\nThe Bosnian War was an international armed conflict that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1 April 1992 and 14 December 1995. After popular pressure, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was asked by the United Nations to intervene in the Bosnian War after allegations of war crimes against civilians were made. In response to the refugee and humanitarian crisis in Bosnia, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 743 on 21 February 1992, creating the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The UNPROFOR mandate was to keep the population alive and deliver humanitarian aid to refugees in Bosnia until the war ended.\n\nOn 9 October 1992, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 781, prohibiting unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. This resolution led to Operation Sky Monitor, where NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone, but it did not take action against violators of the resolution. On 31 March 1993, in response to 500 documented violations, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 816, which authorized states to use measures \"to ensure compliance\" with the no-fly zone over Bosnia. In response, on 12 April, NATO initiated Operation Deny Flight, which was tasked with enforcing the no-fly zone and allowed to engage the violators of the no-fly zone. However, Serb forces on the ground continued to attack UN \"safe areas\" in Bosnia, and the UN peacekeepers were unable to fight back as the mandate did not give them authority to do so. On 4 June, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 836 authorizing the use of force by UNPROFOR in the protection of specially designated safe zones. Operation Sharp Guard, a naval blockade in the Adriatic Sea by NATO and the Western European Union, was approved at a joint session of NATO and the WEU on 8 June and began on 15 June.\n\nOn 6 February 1994, a day after the first Markale marketplace massacre, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali formally requested NATO to confirm that air strikes would be carried out immediately. On 9 February, agreeing to the request of the UN, NATO authorized the Commander of Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH), US Admiral Jeremy Boorda, to launch air strikes against artillery and mortar positions in and around Sarajevo that were determined by UNPROFOR to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets. Only Greece failed to support the use of air strikes, but it did not veto the proposal. The Council also issued an ultimatum at the 9 February meeting to the Bosnian Serbs, in which they demanded that the Serbs remove their heavy weapons around Sarajevo by midnight of 20–21 February or face air strikes. There was some confusion surrounding compliance with the ultimatum, and Hungarian Prime Minister Péter Boross announced that Hungary's air space would be closed to NATO aircraft in the event of air strikes. On 12 February 1994, Sarajevo enjoyed its first casualty-free day in 22 months (since April 1992).\n\nOn 28 February, the scope of NATO involvement in Bosnia increased dramatically. In an incident near Banja Luka, NATO fighters operating under Deny Flight shot down four Bosnian Serb fighters for violating a no-fly zone. This was the first combat operation in the history of NATO and opened the door for a steadily growing NATO role in Bosnia.\n\nOn 12 March, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) made its first request for NATO air support, but close air support was not deployed, owing to a number of delays associated with the approval process. On 10 and 11 April 1994, UNPROFOR called in air strikes to protect the Goražde safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets. This was the first time in NATO's history it had ever attacked ground targets with aircraft. Subsequently, the Bosnian Serbs took 150 UN personnel hostage on 14 April. On 16 April, a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Bosnian Serb forces. Around 29 April, a Danish contingent (Nordbat 2) on peacekeeping duty in Bosnia, as part of UNPROFOR's Nordic battalion located in Tuzla, was ambushed when trying to relieve a Swedish observation post (Tango 2) that was under heavy artillery fire by the Bosnian Serb Šekovići brigade at the village of Kalesija, but the ambush was dispersed when the UN forces retaliated with heavy fire in what would be known as Operation Bøllebank.\n\nOn 5 August, at the request of the UNPROFOR, two US A-10 Thunderbolts located and strafed a Bosnian Serb anti-tank vehicle near Sarajevo after the Serbs tested NATO's resolve by seizing weapons that had been impounded by UN troops and attacking a UN helicopter. Afterwards, the Serbs agreed to return the remaining heavy weapons. On 22 September 1994, NATO aircraft carried out an air strike against a Bosnian Serb tank at the request of UNPROFOR.\n\nOn 25–26 May 1995, after violations of the exclusion zones and the shelling of safe areas, NATO aircraft carried out air strikes against Bosnian Serb ammunition depots in Pale. In retaliation, the Bosnian Serbs took 370 UN peacekeepers in Bosnia hostage and subsequently used them as human shields at potential targets in a successful bid to prevent further air strikes. On 2 June, two US Air Force F-16 jets were sent on patrol over Bosnia in support of Operation Deny Flight. While on patrol, an F-16 piloted by Captain Scott O'Grady was shot down by a Bosnian Serb 2K12 Kub surface-to-air missile. O'Grady was forced to eject from the aircraft. Six days later, he was rescued by US marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit from . The event would come to be known as the Mrkonjić Grad incident.\n\nOn 11 July, NATO aircraft attacked targets in the Srebrenica area of Bosnia and Herzegovina as identified by and under the control of the United Nations. This was in response to Bosnian Serb forces advancing on the UN-declared Safe Area of Srebrenica. Bosnian Serb warlord Ratko Mladić threatened to kill 50 UN peacekeepers who were seized as hostages and also threatened to shell the Muslim population in Srebrenica if NATO air strikes continued. The UN peacekeepers called off the air strikes and agreed to withdraw from Srebrenica as the Bosnian Serbs promised they would take care of the Muslim population for the peacekeepers to spare their own lives. For two weeks, VRS forces under Mladić killed over 8,000 Bosniaks, mainly men and boys, in the Srebrenica massacre, which remains the worst act of genocide in Europe since World War II.\n\nOn 25 July, the North Atlantic Council authorized military planning aimed at deterring an attack on the safe area of Goražde, and threatened the use of NATO air power if this safe area was threatened or attacked. On 1 August, the Council took similar decisions aimed at deterring attacks on the safe areas of Sarajevo, Bihać, and Tuzla. On 4 August, NATO aircraft conducted air strikes against Croat Serb air defense radars near Udbina airfield and Knin in Croatia. On 10 August, the Commanders of Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH) and UNPROFOR concluded a memorandum of understanding on the execution of air strikes.\n\nOn 30 August, the Secretary General of NATO announced the start of air strikes, supported by UNPROFOR rapid reaction force artillery attacks. Although planned and approved by the North Atlantic Council in July 1995, the operation was triggered in direct response to the second Markale massacre on 28 August 1995.\n\nAs many as 400 NATO aircraft participated in the air campaign. Overall, 3,515 sorties were flown and a total of 1,026 bombs were dropped on 338 Bosnian Serb targets located within 48 complexes. NATO aircraft struck 97% of their targets, and seriously damaged more than 80% of them. 708 of the bombs dropped were precision-guided munitions. The aircraft involved in the campaign operated from Aviano Air Base, Italy, and from the US aircraft carriers and , and French aircraft carriers Foch and Clemenceau (rotating) in the Adriatic Sea. The VRS integrated air defence network, comprising aircraft and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), presented a high-threat environment to NATO air operations.\n\nThe German Luftwaffe saw action for the first time since 1945 during Operation Deliberate Force. Six interdictor-strike (IDS) version Tornados, equipped with infrared recce devices and escorted by 8 ECR Tornados, pinpointed Serb targets around Sarajevo for the Rapid Reaction Force artillery.\n\nFrustrated by the previous absence of results and the resistance of the Serbian parties to any peace progress, the Western powers, led by French President Jacques Chirac, decided to set up a strong and deterrent force on site in order to support the western diplomatic efforts. France, UK and US decided to send a multinational brigade in Sarajevo area (Mount Igman), supported by an airmobile brigade and an armored battalion in reserve. The MN Brigade was strong of 4000 military (2000 French, 1500 British, 500 Dutch). The creation of the Force is authorized by the UN Resolution 998 on 16 June 1995.\n\nCommanded by French General Andre Soubirou, the MN brigade was operational in August 1995 on Mount Igman. The main force was constituted by a mixed artillery regiment (French Art. Group with 8 155 mm AUF1 howitzer AUF1, British art. group with 12 105 Light Gun, French and Dutch 120 mm Heavy Mortar platoon). Although the artillery fired before and after the Markale Market Massacre, the main action was on 28 and 29 August 1995, firing 1070 shell on Serbian position (305 155mm shell, 408 120mm shell, 357 105 mm shells).\nThis artillery group was part of the UNPROFOR deployed on Mount Igman to support the task of NATOs aircraft by pounding Serb artillery positions.\n\nOn 30 August, a French Mirage 2000N was shot down by a Bosnian Serb shoulder-fired SAM near Pale. On 1 September, NATO and UN demanded the lifting of the Serb's Siege of Sarajevo, removal of heavy weapons from the heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and complete security of other UN safe areas. NATO stopped the air raids and gave an ultimatum to Bosnian Serb leaders. The deadline was set as 4 September. On 5 September 1995, NATO resumed air attacks on Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo and near the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale after the Bosnian Serbs failed to comply with UN demands to lift heavy weapons around Sarajevo. On the night of 10 September, the USS \"Normandy\" launched a Tomahawk missile strike from the central Adriatic Sea against a key air defense radio relay tower at Lisina, near Banja Luka, while US Air Force F-15E and US Navy F/A-18 fighter-bombers hit the same targets with about a dozen precision-guided bombs, and F-16 jets attacked with Maverick missiles.\n\nOn 14 September, NATO air strikes were suspended to allow the implementation of an agreement with Bosnian Serbs, to include the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the Sarajevo exclusion zone. The initial 72-hour suspension was eventually extended to 114 hours. Finally on 20 September, General Bernard Janvier (Commander, UNPF) and Admiral Leighton W. Smith, Jr. (CINCSOUTH) agreed that resumption of air strikes of Operation Deliberate Force was not necessary as Bosnian Serbs had complied with the conditions set out by the UN and as a result the operation was terminated. The air campaign was key to pressure on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to take part in negotiations that resulted in the Dayton Agreement reached in November 1995.\n\nThe two French airmen who were captured after their Mirage 2000N was downed by Bosnian Serb forces on 30 August 1995, Lt. Jose Souvignet and Capt. Frederic Chiffot, were released only upon the end of the Bosnian War, on 12 December 1995. Upon being released, they told reporters that they had been treated well while in captivity.\n\nIn December 1995, NATO dispatched a 60,000-strong peacekeeping force into Bosnia as part of the IFOR to enforce the Dayton Peace Agreement to secure peace and prevent renewed hostilities between three warring factions. In December 1996, the NATO-led SFOR was established to replace the IFOR to enforce the Dayton Peace Agreement. This lasted up until December 2004, when the EUFOR Althea replaced the NATO-led SFOR.\n\n\n"}

Their escape had been handled by Kislitsyn, an M.G.B. officer who was in Australia when Petrov defected in 1954. Petrov also disclosed that Burgess and Maclean were living in Kuibyshev in 1954. (National Archives Reference:kv/2/3440)\n\nHe decided to join the Soviet spy organization, the OGPU, in May 1933. He was subsequently admitted to the \"Special Cipher Section\", which was attached to the \"Foreign Department\" of the OGPU. It was his status in this section which allowed him to learn many Soviet secrets by reading the top secret ciphers.\n\nPetrov lived through the purges of Stalin under Yagoda, Yezhov, and Beria. Even though a great number of his friends, colleagues, and superiors were arrested and executed, Petrov escaped unscathed.\n\nHaving graduated from cipher clerk to full-fledged agent, Petrov was sent to Australia by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) in 1951. His job there was to recruit spies and to keep watch on Soviet citizens, making sure that none of the Soviets abroad defected. Ironically, it was in Australia where events would occur which led to his own defection from the USSR. This came about through his association with Polish-born doctor and musician Michael Bialoguski, who played along in seeming to allow Petrov to recruit him to gather information, while at the same time reporting to Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on Petrov's activities.\n\nPetrov applied for political asylum in 1954, on the grounds that he could provide information regarding a Soviet spy ring operating out of the Soviet Embassy in Australia. Petrov states in his memoirs (ghost written by Michael Thwaites) that his reasoning for defecting lay not in an imminent fear of being executed, but in his disillusionment with the Soviet system and his own experiences and knowledge of the terror and human suffering inflicted on the Soviet people by their government. He witnessed the destruction of the Siberian village in which he was born, caused by forced collectivization and the famine which resulted.\n\nPetrov became an Australian citizen in 1956. He and his wife Evdokia's names were changed to Sven and Maria Anna Allyson. They lived a quiet suburban life in Melbourne. He died in 1991, and she died in 2002.\n\nThe whereabouts of the Petrovs were still the subject of a D-Notice in 1982.\n\nPetrov's defection has inspired a number of fictional works.\n\n\n"}

The band formed in 1976 in Ylöjärvi, a small town near Tampere. The band is the best-selling music artist in Finland, with certified sales of nearly two million records, and it has also gained success especially in the use of the Finnish language in rock lyrics. In addition to their studio albums, Eppu Normaali also released live records, DVDs, and over 20 singles.\n\nEppu Normaali's most famous songs include \"Vuonna '85\" (In the Year '85), \"Kitara, taivas ja tähdet\" (The Guitar, the Sky and the Stars), \"Murheellisten laulujen maa\" (Land of Sad Songs), \"Pimeyden tango\" (Tango of Darkness), \"Suolaista sadetta\" (Salty Rain) and \"Tahroja paperilla\" (Stains on Paper).\n\nThe members of the original band were Juha Torvinen (guitar), Mikko Saarela (bass), Aku Syrjä (drums), and brothers Martti Syrjä (vocals) and Mikko \"Pantse\" Syrjä (guitar). (The brothers are the sons of accomplished writers Kirsi Kunnas and Jaakko Syrjä). In 1979, bassist Mikko Saarela left the band, and Mikko Nevalainen played bass with Eppu Normaali until 1989. The current bassist is Sami Ruusukallio.\n\nThe band took its name from a character in the Mel Brooks movie \"Young Frankenstein\", and the subtitler translated the name of the character \"Abby Normal\" (\"abnormal\") into the Finnish equivalent \"Eppu Normaali\" (\"epänormaali\", roughly 'abnormal'; a Finnish equivalent of the original play with words).\n\nIn 1977, the band participated in a local rock music competition. Finnish folk/pop legend Juice Leskinen was present and issued a demand that they \"must win\", but the judges were unimpressed—the band did not win. The band began sending demos to various record companies and they were soon signed to Poko Rekords.\n\nThey initially released albums in a punk pop style that gained favourable reviews, but the band did not gain mainstream acceptance until 1984 with what had evolved into a more AOR-oriented music style. \"Rupisia Riimejä Karmeita Tarinoita\" was released in 1984, and it was followed by \"Kahdeksas Ihme\" in 1985 and \"Valkoinen Kupla\" in 1986. This trio of albums were all hits, with combined sales of over 300,000 copies. \"Kahdeksas Ihme\" is their top-selling non-greatest hits record to date.\n\nAlthough their albums all sold well, the band decided to take a break in 1989 after intensive tours around the country and when Mikko Nevalainen left the group. In 1993, they released \"Studio Etana\", which was to become their last studio album for eleven years. The band came close to breaking up, citing \"lacking inspiration\" as the primary cause. Their 1996 release \"Repullinen hittejä\", a greatest hits compilation sold over 240,000 copies, reaching the top of the Finnish charts. This record also stayed on the charts for over two years, a duration which is second of all time in Finland. After its release, the band effectively stopped touring or performing live.\n\nIn 2004, the band announced they would record a new album, \"Sadan vuoden päästäkin\", which became one of the band's most successful releases. In 2007, they released their most recent album, \"Syvään päähän\".\n\nIn 2016, the band celebrated its 40th anniversary with a document film, book, photo exhibition and a massive show on Ratina stadium.

{"id": "1797454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797454", "title": "Noah Noble", "text": "Noah Noble\n\nNoah Noble (January 15, 1794 – February 8, 1844) was the fifth Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from 1831 to 1837. His two terms focused largely on internal improvements, culminating in the passage of the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act, which was viewed at the time as his crowning achievement. His taxing recommendations to pay for the improvements were not fully enacted, and the project ultimately led the state to negotiate a partial bankruptcy only a few years later. The debacle led to a gradual collapse of the state Whig party, which never regained control of the government, and led to a period of Democratic control that lasted until the middle of the American Civil War. After his term as governor he was appointed to the Board of Internal Improvement where he unsuccessfully advocated a reorganization of the projects in an attempt to gain some benefit from them.\n\nNoah Noble was born in Berryville, Virginia, on January 15, 1794, one of fourteen children of Dr. Thomas Noble and Elizabeth Clair Sedgwick Noble. Around 1800, his family moved to the frontier where his father opened a medical practice in Campbell County, Kentucky. In 1807, the family moved again to Boone County where his father acquired a plantation which was operated by slave labor. Noble moved to Brookville, Indiana, around 1811 at age seventeen, following his brother James Noble, who had moved there some time earlier. James was a prominent lawyer and later United States Senator.\n\nIn Indiana he made several business ventures with his partner Enoch D. John. Together they operated a hotel in Brookville, became heavily involved in land speculation, and opened a water-powered weaving mill with a wool carding machine. Noble also opened a trading company called N. Noble & Company. The company purchased produce from area farmers and shipped it to New Orleans to be sold. In 1819 a boating accident destroyed one of his shipments and left him with a large debt that took several years to repay. Later that year he married his cousin, Catherin Stull van Swearingen. The two shared the same great-grandfather. They had three children, but only one survived into adulthood; two died as infants.\n\nNoble entered politics in 1820, winning an election to become Franklin County's sheriff. By the time of his 1822 reelection bid he had become very popular in the county, and he won reelection 1,186 to 9 votes. He was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 7th Regiment of the Indiana militia in 1817, and a colonel in 1820. When his term as sheriff expired, he ran to represent the county in the Indiana House of Representatives, winning overwhelmingly. He was reelected again the following year but resigned following the death of his brother Lazarus. Lazarus had been the Receiver of Public Moneys of the Indianapolis Land Office, and his death left a vacancy. His brother, Senator James Noble, used his influence to secure the post for Noble, who remained in the position until 1829. The job took him to Indianapolis, where he was responsible for collecting revenue for the federal government. The position brought him into contact with many of the leading men in the state and he was quick to create good relationships with them. Following the election of President Andrew Jackson and the employment of the spoils system, Noble was removed from the position.\n\nFinding himself without a job, Noble launched another business venture. Before he could open the new business, his friends in the Indiana General Assembly appointed him to a commission that was responsible for laying out the Michigan Road. He remained on the commission until 1831, at which time he announced his candidacy for governor of Indiana as a Whig candidate, and secured the Whig nomination.\n\nDuring the campaign, he accused his Democratic opponent James G. Read of being ineligible to run because he was a Federal Receiver. The state constitution forbade state officials from holding both federal and state positions simultaneously. His opponent made a similar charge against Noble, who still held his position as a federal commissioner working on the Michigan Road. Noble campaigned heavily on the internal improvement platform and won the election by a plurality of 23,518 votes to Read's 21,002, with independent Milton Stapp taking 6,894.\n\nAfter becoming governor he purchased several lots on the eastern edge of the capitol, planting an orchard and vineyard and building a large brick home. He brought some of his father's emancipated slaves with him to work in his household, one of whom was supposedly the model for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom. She visited Noble's home on more than one occasion.\n\nIndiana was continuing to experience a period of prosperity as a large influx of settlers purchased land, thereby providing a large income for the government. Noble's predecessor had begun the framework for the large-scale internal improvements that were to come, but had significantly delayed the start of the canal projects. Noble set to work immediately and within a few months he completed surveying the route of the Wabash and Erie Canal and made several recommendations regarding its construction. Noble was opposed to railroads, which he viewed as monopolies since only the rail company could transport goods on the line, whereas canals were open to anyone had a boat. Construction on the canal began in earnest in 1832.\n\nConstruction on state roads was progressing slowly because of a lack of funding. Noble proposed the state borrow money to speed the construction process, but the legislature rejected his proposal. He also recommended the creation of an Internal Improvement Board to coordinate the projects and possibly reduce costs through better organization and purchase of supplies in bulk, but again the General Assembly rejected the proposal, and instead kept the projects operating under several different project boards. His first term passed with little advancement on the internal improvement front because the representatives from southern part of the state blocked any large-scale plans on the grounds that such projects would have little value for their constituents since most of the projects would be in the central part of the state.\n\nNoble had a census conducted and recommended that the legislature reapportion representation to grant more seats to the central counties. The legislature approved the plan, and expanded the Senate and House of Representatives to their present sizes of 50 and 100 seats, respectively. The change gave the central and northern parts of the state more representatives than the south for the first time, despite the fact that the south was still significantly more populous. Noble made several recommendations for the reform of public schools. Most of the measures were not accepted, but the expansion of the Indiana College was approved, and township schools were granted considerably more power over their own operations.\n\nThe Second Bank of the United States was closed during Noble's first term, leaving the state without a bank to hold government deposits or to supply paper money. There had been no banks operating in Indiana for a decade, so with no alternative to the situation the General Assembly passed a bill to create the Bank of Indiana. Noble had not taken a position on the bill, but signed it into law. The bank eventually turned out to be very profitable and one of the most important acts of his time in office. Noble also oversaw the creation of plans to build Indiana's third statehouse in 1831. The building was completed in 1835, and he also oversaw the move of the government's offices.\n\nNoble was re-elected in 1834, campaigning against James G. Read for a second time. During the campaign, Noble sold a Kentucky slave that belonged to his father. The account was widely published, and turned the anti-slavery elements in the state against him, demonstrating by his receiving only 28 votes from the Quaker-dominated eastern counties of the state. He ultimately won the election, 27,767 to 19,994 votes. Noble called out the militia in parts of the state when it was threatened during the Black Hawk War, a Native American uprising to the west of Indiana. 150 men were sent to Illinois, where they skirmished with the native uprising. The scare was only brief, and the focus soon returned to the internal improvements.\n\nWith the legislature closely divided on the issue, additional projects were proposed for the southern areas of the state to gain the support of their representatives. All the projects were bundled into one bill and passed as the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act in 1836. The act caused a great deal of celebration in the state and Noble considered the act his greatest achievement at the time. To pay for the act, which was projected to cost $10 million, Noble had also recommended a 50% increase in all state taxes. However, the legislature failed to pass that measure.\n\nThe Panic of 1837 hit the following year, causing a sharp decrease in tax revenues, even as the state budget was already faced a large deficit because of the interest on the debt. Property taxes were the state's primary regular income, and to increase the revenue Noble proposed that the tax be levied ad valorem. The change would save the state a significant amount in administrative and collection costs, and make more land subject to taxation. The tax was approved and led to a 25% increase in revenue the following year, but it was still not enough to cover the deficit. Noble proposed the projects be prioritized, and work halted on the less important ones to conserve funds, but the plan was rejected. By the time Noble left office, the state's financial situation was bleak, but it was not yet fully apparent that far more had been borrowed than could be paid back. Despite the dire situation, Noble left office in 1837 as a popular political figure and was able to use his prestige to help elect David Wallace, his lieutenant governor, as governor.\n\nIn both 1834 and 1836, Noble had his name entered as a candidate for the United States Senate, but in both years the legislature decided to send someone else to Congress, much to Noble's disappointment.\n\nAfter leaving office Noble became a member of the Board of Internal Improvements which was tasked with overseeing the ongoing internal improvements in the state. In 1840, the state ended all funding for the projects. By early 1841 it was clear that the state would not be able to pay even the interest on its debt, and paying it off was out of the question. The board approved the sending of James Lanier to negotiate a bankruptcy with the state's creditors, and all the internal improvement projects, except the separately funded Wabash and Erie Canal, were turned over to the creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt.\n\nEven before Noble had left office, many of his opponents began to blame him for the state's financial situation. He argued that he had proposed tax increases to fund the project, and it was the fault of the General Assembly for not enacting them. Although the short term situation was devastating to the state and many of the projects were never completed, the groundwork laid by the projects led to rapid development after the financial situation was resolved. In the meantime, the debacle became apparent to the public during his successor's term and led to the gradual collapse of the state's Whig party, which never regained power in Indiana. In the immediate years thereafter the Democrats came to power and disposed of all the projects. The situation ultimately led to language in the 1851 constitution prohibiting the state from assuming debt.\n\nNoble returned to private life following the dissolution of the Internal Improvement Board in 1841. The situation was too dire, and opinion too anti-Whig for Noble to have a serious chance of winning public office again. He died at the age of 50 in Indianapolis two years later, on February 8, 1844, and was buried next to his wife, Catherin, in Greenlawn Cemetery. His body was moved to Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis in 1979.\n\nNoble County, Indiana is named in his honor, as is Noble Township in Cass County.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

She rests her right hand on her hip and crosses her left leg over her right. Her left hand grasps a spear on which she leans, and her head is inclined. The meaning of her bowed head has been a matter of debate since the relief's excavation from the Acropolis of Athens in 1888. As the conventional name suggests, many have taken the posture to indicate sadness or pensiveness, and thus to interpret the rectangular object on the viewer's right as a stele, a stone slab that serves as a grave marker. Others see an 'exhausted Athena', and others still see no such emotion. The exact nature of the rectangular object, too, is unclear – some suggest that an object was perched atop it (e.g., the infant Erichthonius) – others that it is a marker from a race-course.\n\nThe relief is 0.48 m high and made of Parian marble.

{"id": "1797461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797461", "title": "Rondeau (forme fixe)", "text": "Rondeau (forme fixe)\n\nA rondeau (plural rondeaux) is a form of medieval and Renaissance French poetry, as well as the corresponding musical chanson form. Together with the ballade and the virelai it was considered one of the three \"formes fixes\", and one of the verse forms in France most commonly set to music between the late 13th and the 15th centuries. It is structured around a fixed pattern of repetition of material involving a refrain. The rondeau is believed to have originated in dance songs involving alternating singing of the refrain elements by a group and of the other lines by a soloist. The term \"Rondeau\" is today used both in a wider sense, covering several older variants of the form – which are sometimes distinguished as the triolet and rondel – and in a narrower sense referring to a 15-line variant which developed from these forms in the 15th and 16th centuries. The rondeau is unrelated with the much later instrumental dance form that shares the same name in French baroque music, which is an instance of what is more commonly called the rondo form in classical music.\n\nThe older French rondeau or \"rondel\" as a song form between the 13th and mid-15th century begins with a full statement of its refrain, which consists of two halves. This is followed first by a section of non-refrain material that mirrors the metrical structure and rhyme of the refrain's first half, then by a repetition of the first half of the refrain, then by a new section corresponding to the structure of the full refrain, and finally by a full restatement of the refrain. Thus, it can be schematically represented as AB aAab AB, where \"A\" and \"B\" are the repeated refrain parts, and \"a\" and \"b\" the remaining verses. If the poem has more than one stanza, it continues with further sequences of aAab AB, aAab AB, etc.\n\nIn its simplest and shortest form, the \"rondeau simple\", each of the structural parts is a single verse, leading to the eight-line structure known today as triolet, as shown in \"Doulz viaire gracieus\" by Guillaume de Machaut:\n\nIn larger rondeau variants, each of the structural sections may consist of several verses, although the overall sequence of sections remains the same. Variants include the \"rondeau tercet\", where the refrain consists of three verses, the \"rondeau quatrain\", where it consists of four (and, accordingly, the whole form of sixteen), and the \"rondeau cinquain\", with a refrain of five verses (and a total length of 21), which becomes the norm in the 15th century. In the \"rondeau quatrain\", the rhyme scheme is usually ABBA ab AB abba ABBA; in the \"rondeau cinquain\" it is AABBA aab AAB aabba AABBA.\n\nA typical example of a \"rondeau cinquain\" of the 15th century is the following:\n\nIn the medieval manuscripts, the restatement of the refrain is usually not written out, but only indicated by giving the first words or first line of the refrain part. After the mid-15th century, this feature came to be regarded no longer as a mere scribal abbreviation, but as an actual part of the poetry. As the form was gradually divorced from the musical structure and became a purely literary genre, it is often not entirely clear how much of the refrain material was actually meant to be repeated. A \"rondeau quatrain\" in which the first refrain interjection (lines 7–8, rhymes AB) is preserved in full, while the final restatement of the refrain is reduced to a single line (A) or again just two lines (AB), ends up with a total of 13 or 14 lines respectively. This form is usually defined as the \"rondel\" in modern literary compendia.\n\nAnother version has the refrains shortened even further. Both restatements are reduced to just the first two or three words of the first line, which now stand as short, pithy, non-rhyming lines in the middle and at the end of the poem. These half-lines are called \"rentrement\". If derived from the erstwhile \"rondeau quatrain\", this results in a 12-line structure that is now called the \"rondeau prime\", with the rentrements in lines 7 and 12. If derived from the erstwhile 21-line \"rondeau cinquain\", the result is a 15-line form with the rentrements in lines 9 and 15 (rhyme scheme aabba–aabR–aabbaR). \nThis 15-line form became the norm in the literary rondeau of the later Renaissance, and is known as the \"rondeau\" proper today. The following is a typical example of this form:\n\nA large corpus of medieval French rondeaux was collected, catalogued, and studied by Nico H.J. van den Boogaard in his dissertation \"Rondeaux et refrains du XIIe siècle au début du XIVe: Collationnement, introduction et notes\" (Paris: Klincksieck, 1969).\n\nLike the other formes fixes, the Rondeau (in its original form with full refrains) was frequently set to music. The earliest surviving polyphonic rondeaux are by the trouvère Adam de la Halle in the late 13th century. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Guillaume de Machaut, Guillaume Dufay, Hayne van Ghizeghem and other prominent composers were prolific in the form. Early rondeaux are usually found as interpolations in longer narrative poems, and separate monophonic musical settings survive. After the 15th century, the musical form went out of fashion and the rondeau became a purely literary form.\n\nThe musical rondeau is typically a two-part composition, with all the \"A\" sections of the poem's AB-aAab-AB structure set to one line of music, and all the \"B\" parts to another.\n\nAlthough far rarer than the French usage, the Italian equivalent, the \"rondello\" was occasionally composed and listed among the Italian forms of poetry for music. A single rondello appears in the Rossi Codex. In addition, several rondeaux in French appear entirely in sources originating in Italy, the Low Countries, and Germany, suggesting that these works (including \"Esperance, qui en mon cuer\") may not have a purely French provenance.\n\nLater, in the Baroque era, the label \"rondeau\" (or the adjectival phrase \"en rendeau\") was applied to dance movements in simple refrain form by such composers as Jean-Baptiste Lully and Louis Couperin.\n\nArnold Schoenberg's \"Pierrot Lunaire\" sets 21 poems by Albert Giraud, each of which is a 13-line poetic rondeau.\n\nThe French rondeau forms have been adapted to English at various times by different poets. Geoffrey Chaucer wrote two rondeaus in the \"rondeau tercet\" form, one of them at the end of \"The Parliament of Fowls,\" where the birds are said to \"synge a roundel\" to a melody \"imaked in Fraunce\":\n\nIn its classical 16th-century 15-line form with a \"rentrement\" (aabba–aabR–aabbaR), the rondeau was used by Thomas Wyatt. Later, it was reintroduced by some late 19th-century and 20th-century poets, such as Paul Laurence Dunbar (\"We Wear the Mask\"). It was customarily regarded as a challenge to arrange for these refrains to contribute to the meaning of the poem in as succinct and poignant a manner as possible. Perhaps the best-known English rondeau is the World War I poem, \"In Flanders Fields\" by John McCrae:\n\nA more complex form is the rondeau redoublé. This is also written on two rhymes, but in five stanzas of four lines each and one of five lines. Each of the first four lines (stanza 1) get individually repeated in turn once by becoming successively the respective fourth lines of stanzas 2, 3, 4, & 5; and the first part of the first line is repeated as a short fifth line to conclude the sixth stanza. This can be represented as - A1,B1,A2,B2 - b,a,b,A1 - a,b,a,B1 - b,a,b,A2 - a,b,a,B2 - b,a,b,a,(A1).\n\nThe following example of the form was written from the point of view of one of the RAF officers carrying the coffin of Diana, Princess of Wales to the plane that was to carry it to England.\n\n"}

It lies in the Székely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania. \n\nWith a population of 1,617, it is the smallest town in Romania by population. It is located at an altitude of 650 metres in the southern reaches of the Ciuc depression, between the Harghita and Bodoc mountains, in the valley of the Olt, and is to this day an important spa town. The town administers one village, Carpitus (\"Kárpitus\").\n\nThe town and the surrounding area are famous for their spas and mineral waters received from seven springs. Nearby is the Lake Sfânta Ana, a famous volcanic crater lake, the only one of its kind in Romania.\n\nThe water has long been used for bathing by the Székely people. The most probable date for the founding of the bathing station is 1842. It was an alleged miraculous healing of the son of a shepherd from his rashes that first attracted widespread attention to the therapeutic properties of local mineral waters, after which a company was founded to develop the springs in 1845. The bathing station was destroyed in the skirmishes of 1849, but Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph, on visiting the town in 1852, ordered the reconstruction of the baths. \n\nThe rapid development of the town began after 1860. The Mikes-source was named in honour of count Benedek Mikes, chairman of the spa committee, who appointed a chemist at his own expense to analyse the water of the spring bearing his name. This marked the start of the scientific evaluation and utilisation of local mineral waters. The Stefánia Medical Center was opened in 1890 and remained the treatment center of the spa until 1975. Lake Csukás (now: Ciucaș) was artificially created in 1900, and the big hotels of the town were built in the 1970s.\n\nThe settlement was historically part of the Székely Land area of Transylvania and belonged to Csíkszék district until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within Csík County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of Romania and fell within Ciuc County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and it was held by Hungary until 1944. \n\nAfter Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the town became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952-60, the commune fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960-68 the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the commune, as a town, has been part of Harghita County.\n\nThe population of the town is 1,617; it has a Székely Hungarian majority with 1,460 (90.3%) Hungarians (2011 census). There are also small communities of ethnic Romanians (6.9%) and Romani (2.6%).\n\n\"Historical demographic data:\"\n\"Demographic trends according to the censuses:\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe town is twinned with:\n\n"}

He is presumed to have been kidnapped.\n, there have been no arrests made and the case is now considered cold, but remains open.\n\nHis mother, Noreen Gosch, claimed that Johnny escaped from his captors and visited her with an unidentified man in March 1997. She claimed that her son told her that he had been the victim of a pedophile organization and had been cast aside when he was too old but subsequently feared for his life and lived under an assumed identity, feeling it was not safe to return home. Gosch's father, John, divorced from Noreen since 1993, has publicly stated that he is not sure whether or not such a visit actually occurred. Authorities have not located Gosch or confirmed Noreen Gosch's account, and his fate continues to be the subject of speculation, conspiracy theories, and dispute.\n\nThe case received huge publicity in 2006 when his mother claimed to have found photographs on her doorstep depicting Gosch in captivity. Some of the photos received were claimed to be children from a case in Florida, but one boy in the photos was never identified. Noreen Gosch insists that boy is Johnny.\n\nGosch's picture was among the first to be featured on milk cartons as part of a campaign to find missing children.\n\nOn Sunday, September 5, 1982, in the suburb of West Des Moines, Johnny Gosch left home before dawn to begin his paper route. Although it was customary for Johnny to awaken his father to help with the route, the boy took only the family's miniature dachshund, Gretchen, with him that morning. Other paper carriers for \"The Des Moines Register\" would later report having seen Gosch at the paper drop, picking up his newspapers. It was the last sighting of Gosch that can be corroborated by multiple witnesses.\n\nA neighbor named Mike reported that he observed Gosch talking to a stocky man in a blue two-toned Ford Fairmont with Nebraska plates; Mike did not know what was discussed because he was observing from his bedroom window. As Gosch headed home, Mike noticed another man following Gosch. Another witness, John Rossi, saw a man in a blue car talking to Gosch and \"thought something was strange\". He looked at the license plate, but could not recall the plate number. He said, \"I keep hoping I'll wake up in the middle of the night and see that number on the license plate as distinctly as night and day, but that hasn't happened.\" Rossi underwent hypnosis and told police some of the numbers and that the plate was from Warren County, Iowa.\n\nJohn and Noreen Gosch, Johnny's parents, began receiving phone calls from customers along their son's route, complaining of undelivered papers. John performed a cursory search of the neighborhood around 6 a.m. He immediately found Johnny's wagon full of newspapers two blocks from their home. The Gosches immediately contacted the West Des Moines police department, and reported Johnny's disappearance. Noreen, in her public statements and her book \"Why Johnny Can't Come Home\", has been critical of what she perceives as a slow reaction time from authorities, and of the policy at the time that Gosch could not be classified as a missing person until 72 hours had passed. By her estimation, the police did not arrive to take her report for a full 45 minutes.\n\nInitially, the police came to believe that Gosch was a runaway, but later they changed their statement and suggested that Gosch was kidnapped, but they were unable to establish a viable motive. They turned up little evidence and arrested no suspects in connection with the case.\n\nA few months after his September 1982 disappearance, Noreen Gosch has said her son was spotted in Oklahoma, when a boy yelled to a woman for help before being dragged off by two men.\n\nOver the years, several private investigators have assisted the Gosches with the search for their son. Among them are Jim Rothstein, a retired New York City police detective and Ted Gunderson, a retired chief of the Los Angeles FBI branch.\n\nIn 1984, Gosch's photograph appeared alongside that of Juanita Rafaela Estevez on milk cartons across America; they were the second and third abducted children to have their plights publicized in this way. The first was Etan Patz. Estevez would later escape from her abductors in 1986.\n\nOn August 12, 1984, Eugene Martin, another Des Moines-area paperboy, disappeared under similar circumstances. He disappeared while delivering newspapers on the south side of Des Moines.\n\nAuthorities were unable to prove a connection between the two cases, yet Noreen Gosch claims that she was personally informed of the abduction a few months in advance by a private investigator who was searching for her son. She was told the kidnapping \"would take place the second weekend in August 1984 and it would be a paperboy from the southside of Des Moines.\"\n\nAccording to Noreen Gosch's account, she was awakened around 2:30 a.m. one morning in March 1997 by a knock at her apartment door. Waiting outside was Johnny Gosch, now 27, accompanied by an unidentified man. Gosch said she immediately recognized her son, who opened his shirt to reveal a birthmark on his chest. \"We talked about an hour or an hour and a half. He was with another man, but I have no idea who the person was. Johnny would look over to the other person for approval to speak,\" says Gosch. \"He didn't say where he is living or where he was going.\"\n\nIn a 2005 interview, Gosch said, \"The night that he came here, he was wearing jeans and a shirt and had a coat on because it was March. It was cold and his hair was long; it was shoulder-length and it was straight and dyed black.\" After the visit, she had the FBI create a picture she says looked like Johnny.\n\nGosch self-published a book in 2000 titled \"Why Johnny Can't Come Home\". The book presents her understanding of what her son went through, based on the original research of various private investigators and her son's visit.\n\nOn September 1, 2006, Gosch reported that she found photographs left at her front door, some of which she posted on her website. One color photo shows three boys bound and gagged. She claims that a black-and-white photo appears to show 12-year-old Johnny Gosch with his mouth gagged, his hands and feet tied, and an apparent human brand on his shoulder. A third photo shows a man, possibly dead, who may have something tied around his neck. Mrs. Gosch alleged the man was one of the \"perpetrators who molested [my] son\".\n\nGosch later said the first two photos had originated on a website featuring child pornography.\n\nOn September 13, an anonymous letter was mailed to Des Moines police.\n\nGentlemen,\nSomeone has played a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in question is not one of her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about 1979–80, challenging each other to an escape contest. There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be easy enough to check out.\n\nNelson Zalva, who worked for the Hillsborough County, Florida Sheriff's Office in the 1970s, said the details of the letter were true and adds that he also investigated the black-and-white in \"1978 or 1979\", before Gosch's disappearance. \"I interviewed the kids, and they said there was no coercion or touching. ... I could never prove a crime,\" Zalva says. When asked for proof that this was indeed the same photo from the investigation nearly three decades prior, Zalva could not provide any. According to the documentary film \"Who Took Johnny\" (2014), only three boys in the pictures were identified by law enforcement, but not the one thought to be Johnny. Noreen Gosch still believes the pictures to be of her son.\n\nThe case generated national interest as Noreen Gosch became increasingly vocal about the inadequacy of law enforcement's investigation of missing children cases. She established the Johnny Gosch Foundation in 1982, through which she visited schools and spoke at seminars about the \"modus operandi\" of sexual predators. She lobbied for \"The Johnny Gosch Bill\", state legislation which would mandate an immediate police response to reports of missing children. The bill became law in Iowa in 1984, and similar or identical laws were later passed in Missouri and seven other states.\n\nIn August 1984, Noreen Gosch testified in Senate hearings on organized crime, speaking about \"organized pedophilia\" and its alleged role in her son's abduction. She began receiving death threats. Gosch also testified before the U.S. Department of Justice, which provided $10 million to establish the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Gosch was invited to the White House by President Ronald Reagan for the dedication ceremony.\n\nIn 1989, 21-year-old Paul A. Bonacci told his attorney John DeCamp that he had been abducted into a sex ring with Gosch as a teenager and was forced to participate in Gosch's kidnapping.\n\nJohn DeCamp met with Bonacci and believed he was telling the truth. Noreen later met him and said he told her things \"he could know only from talking with her son.\" He said that Johnny had a birthmark on his chest, a scar on his tongue and a burn scar on his lower leg; although a description of the birthmark had been widely circulated, information about the scars had not been made public. Bonacci also described a stammer that Johnny had when he was upset. The FBI and local police do not believe that Bonacci is a credible witness in the case and have not interviewed him.\n\nBonacci accused Republican party activist and businessman Lawrence E. King Jr (b. 1944) who also served as director of the Franklin Credit Union in Omaha, Nebraska, of running an underage prostitution ring and victimizing him since an early age.\n\nIn 1990, a county grand jury declined to charge King, finding the allegations to be \"a carefully crafted hoax\". Paul Bonacci and Alisha Owen were indicted on state perjury charges. A federal grand jury also declined to indict anyone for child prostitution but did return indictments against Owen for perjury and King for fraud related to the credit union; the latter was accused of looting $40 million from the bank and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The bank was shut down in November 1988 when it was raided by the FBI, the IRS and the NCUA. King was released from prison in April 2001.\n\nOn February 27, 1999, the U.S. District Court of the District of Nebraska awarded Bonacci $1 million in compensatory damages and punitive damages. Bonacci had sued King, who failed to respond to the civil lawsuit. Thus a default judgment was entered against King, who ceased his appeal attempt in early 2000.\n\nThe 2014 RUMUR-award-winning-produced documentary, \"Who Took Johnny\" (80 minutes, 2014), is available for streaming through Amazon video on demand service. It is also available on Curiosity Stream. The documentary film includes interviews with Gosch's parents.\n\n\n\n"}

Margot's deportation order from the Gestapo hastened the Frank family into hiding. According to the diary of her younger sister, Anne, Margot kept a diary of her own, but no trace of Margot's diary has ever been found. She died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\n\nMargot Betti Frank, named after maternal aunt Bettina Holländer (1898–1914), was born in Frankfurt, Germany, to Jewish parents, Otto and Edith, and lived in the outer suburbs of the city with her parents, Otto Frank and Edith Frank-Holländer, and also her younger sister Anne Frank, during the early years of her life. Margot is best known as the 'sister of Anne' forever standing in her shadow. The image that we have of her is mainly based on Anne's critical view. \n\nShe attended the Ludwig-Richter School in Frankfurt until the appointment of Adolf Hitler on January 30, 1933, to the position of chancellor in Germany brought an increase of anti-Jewish measures, among which was the expulsion of Jewish schoolchildren from non-denominational schools. In response to the rising tide of anti-semitism, the family decided to follow the 63,000 other Jews who had left Germany that year and immigrate to Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Edith Frank-Holländer and her daughters moved in with her mother in Aachen in June 1933 until Otto Frank found accommodation in Amsterdam. Margot and her mother left Germany to join him on December 5, 1933, followed by Anne in February 1934. Margot was enrolled in an elementary school on Amsterdam's Jekerstraat, close to their new address in Amsterdam South. Despite initial problems with the Dutch language, Margot became a star pupil. She achieved excellent academic results until an anti-Jewish law imposed a year after the 1940 German invasion of the Netherlands demanded her removal to a Jewish lyceum. There she displayed the studiousness and intelligence which had made her noteworthy at her previous schools and was remembered by former pupils as virtuous, reserved, and very obedient. Margot had a large circle of friends and enjoyed rowing and playing tennis in her spare time. In her diary, Anne recounted instances of their mother suggesting she emulate Margot, and although she wrote of admiring her sister in some respects for being handsome and clever, Anne sought to define her own individuality without role models. Margot is also shown to have a much better relationship with at least her mother, and had a much more modest and tolerant nature as opposed to Anne, who was determined and often spoke her mind.\n\nWhile Anne inherited her father's ambivalence towards the Torah, Margot followed her mother's example and became involved in Amsterdam's Jewish community. She took Hebrew classes, attended synagogue, and in 1941 joined a Dutch Zionist club for young people who wanted to immigrate to Palestine to found a Jewish state, where, according to Anne, she wished to become a midwife.\n\nOn July 5, 1942, she received a notice to report to a labor camp and the next day went into hiding with her family in a secret annex of a house. They were later joined by four other Jewish refugees and remained hidden for two years until they were betrayed on August 4, 1944.\n\nAlong with the other occupants of the hiding place, Margot Frank was arrested by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, and detained in their headquarters overnight before being taken to a cell in a nearby prison for three days. From here they were taken by train, on 8 August, to the Dutch Westerbork concentration camp. As the Frank family had failed to respond to Margot's call-up notice in 1942 and had been discovered in hiding, they (along with Fritz Pfeffer and the Van Pels family) were declared criminals by the camp's officials and detained in its punishment block to be sentenced to hard labor in the battery dismantling plant. They remained there until they were selected for Westerbork's last deportation to Auschwitz on September 3, 1944. Margot and Anne were transferred to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on October 30, where both contracted typhus in the winter of 1944.\n\nMargot Frank died March 27, 1945 at the age of 19 due to typhus. A few days later, Anne died due to the same illness. Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper and her sister Lientje buried them together in one of the camp's mass graves; in August 1945, once she came back to the Netherlands and recovered from typhus, Janny wrote to Otto Frank and informed him that both of his daughters had died. \n\nOtto Frank was the only one to survive out of the eight people who went into hiding. When he returned to Amsterdam he was given Anne's diary by Miep Gies, which he later published as a remembrance to her. Along with Anne, Margot Frank also wrote a diary during their time in hiding (Anne mentioned her sister's diary in her own) but Margot's diary was never found. However, many authors wrote fan-based diaries of Margot such as the novel \"The Silent Sister\" by Mazal Alouf-Mizrahi. Letters written by both Frank sisters to American pen pals were published in 2003. Buddy Elias (1925–2015) was Anne's first cousin and last surviving close relative.\n\n\n"}

It is an anonymous work.\n\nIn the play there are two scoundrels, a \"blind\" beggar and his servant boy. The blind beggar has a secret hoard of coins, which the boy tricks away from him. The boy deceives, robs then beats his master—the trickster has become the tricked.\n\nIt was a simple play with no props and could be performed by two actors anywhere. It probably is one of many performed by wandering jongleurs catering to the tastes and theme of market days and fairs. An important business for the actors was to collect money from spectators, and the actors beggar-man part in the play allowed for comic audience participation.\n\nBecause the deceiver is deceived, along with slapstick action, it is considered the oldest surviving farce in French literature. This means it is the oldest to survive in written form, but is part of a much older oral tradition.\n\nThis \"trickster is tricked\" theme, and that of the cuckolded husband, were the main preoccupations of the medieval farceur. The play is in many respects identical to the first chapter of \"The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes,\" a picaresque novel published anonymously in Spain in 1554. The play may have served as source material for the book, or both may have emerged from a common folktale.\n\n"}

In the Edo period, it was administered as \"tenryō\" territory controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various \"hatamoto\".\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, the area was divided into eight villages within Tachibana District in the new Kanagawa Prefecture on April 1, 1889. These areas were annexed by the neighboring city of Kawasaki from 1937-1938. The area became part of a huge government sponsored housing project from the 1950s and 1960s. The area became part of Tama Ward with the division of the city of Kawasaki into wards from April 1972. In July 1982, Miyamae Ward was separated from Takatsu Ward.\n\nTakatsu Ward is largely a regional commercial center and bedroom community for central Kawasaki and Tokyo. Industries are centered on food processing, electronics and precision equipment, and include:\n\n\n\n\nThere is a North Korean school, Nambu Korean Primary School (南武朝鮮初級学校).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1797524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797524", "title": "Borsec", "text": "Borsec\n\nBorsec (, ) is a town in Harghita County, Transylvania, Romania. The town and the surrounding areas are well known for their spas and mineral waters. It has a population of 2,585, with a majority of ethnic Hungarians.\n\nIt was historically part of the Székely Land area of Transylvania. Administratively, it belonged to Csíkszék until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within the Csík County in the Austria-Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of Romania and fell within Ciuc County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the settlement was held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and it became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the town fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region.\n\nBorsec, a resort chiefly known for its mineral water and favourable climate, is situated in the intracarpatic depression of the same name, at an altitude of 900 m. \nThe Borsec Depression has an oval shape and is northeast oriented, being separated from the hilltop of the Rotunda Chair in two subunits. The locality is composed of two areas that correspond geographically to the two small depression areas that join: The Upper Borsec (Borsec de Sus) and The Lower Borsec (Borsec de Jos). The latter is southwest along DN15 at its junction with DJ128 Borsec-Ditrau, and Borsec de Sus (or the resort itself) is located on the plateau located northeast of the primary settlement, which is at higher altitude on average with 80-100 m. In the west, at a short distance, you can reach the Topliţa, the Pass of Creanga and to the east the Bistricioara valley. The Borsec depression is located as altitude superior to that of Giurgeu but lower than that of Bilbor.\nWithin the resort there are alleys and tourist trails, most of which are located in the outskirts of the resort, especially for visiting the nature monuments from the reservation of the Scaunul Rotund and Făget (Bükkhavas). They have the necessary arrangements to perform the field treatment under appropriate conditions, including tourist markings.\n\nMineral water springs are numerous, with a close and stable chemical composition over time, with variable but sufficient flows to be economically used and are currently the main economic engine of the resort. The mineralization characters fall into the group of bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, carbonate and hypotonic mixed mineral waters. The springs of the Borsec Depression occur in two groups - the northern one of greater importance - the springs line having originating from dolomitic crystalline limestone, sources characterized by the accumulation of water in the cracks and the karstic voids (springs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6); and the southern group - the line of springs cantonated in calcareous tuff with a restricted circulation of water through cracks and areas of alteration (springs 10, 11, 15). The most important springs qualitative and as flow of the resort are the springs 1 and 2. Both are captured, their carbonated water - bicarbonated being used for bottling, external and internal cures.\n\nIt is not advisable to use mineral water in the form of a cleanse without medical indication.\nIn the internal cure (through the direct consumption of mineral water), the springs in Borsec are indicated:\n• In diseases of the digestive tract and the adjacent glands: chronic hypo- or normoacid gastritis, dyspepsia, mild enteritis, enterocolitis, fermentation colitis.\n• In chronic hepatitis, posthepatitis states, biliary disorders, sequelae after on the bile ducts surgery.\n• In nutrition diseases: compensated and balanced diabetes mellitus type 2, gout and uterine diathesis.\n• Endocrine diseases: mild hyperthyroid.\n• In diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract: chronic nephritis without kidney failure, pyelonephritis, chronic cystitis, acid urinary lithiasis, sequelae after operations on the urinary tract.\nIn external treatment (through bathing) the Borsec mineral waters can be used in:\n• cardiovascular diseases: chronic myocarditis - no cardiac failure phenomena; valvulopathies - compensated; coronary insufficiency - with mild access, essential hypertension - in the early stages, obliterating arteriopathies - in early stages, sequelae after thrombophlebitis.\nIn the Upper Borsec in the wet areas formed on a clayey layer located on the right side of the Usturoi brook there is a peat (in some parts the thickness exceeds 10 m). The chemical composition gives it qualities of therapeutic sludge that makes it possible to use it in rheumatic diseases.\nUnfortunately, nowadays the Medical Recovery activity is stopped as a result of the closure of the Treatment Base.\n\nIts name is derived from Hungarian \"borvizszék\" meaning \"Seat of Mineral Water\".\n\nBorsec owes its fame to its mineral waters, known for their curing properties. Natural cures (the healing properties of the microclimate, surrounding air, soil and water) and physiotherapeutic properties are reputedly able to improve nutrition and heal a host of metabolic disorders. Borsec is a favorable place for rest and recreation: it is a real paradise for those who enjoy excursions (known destinations include Poiana Zânelor, the ice cave, the bears' cave, Izvorul Strǎvechi, Cetatea Bufnițelor), those who like winter sports (on Făget and Fagetel for beginners and those more advanced) as well as those who like to fish, who can try their luck in the waters of Bistricioara or the Bicaz lake, which are near the resort.\n\nOne famous visitor to Borsec was Moldavian writer Vasile Alecsandri, who wrote the following in 1845: \"\"at Borsec they all are brothers, if not in Jesus then in mineral water [...] one of the most important merits of Borsec is that it gives people human feelings!\"\"\n\nNearby locations include the monasteries of Moldavia (Neamţ, Secu, Văratec, Agapia, Durău, Sihăstria), the Lázár Castle, Lacul Roşu, Cheile Bicazului, Lake Bicaz, the Durău resort, the Praid salt mine, Sovata, and the ceramics centre of Corund.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census, the town's population was 2,864, of whom 2,240 (78.2%) ethnic Hungarians, 607 (21.2%) ethnic Romanians and 0.6% others.\n\nThe 2011 census revealed the population dropped by 10.2%, with an ethnic makeup as follows: 1,975 (76.8%) Hungarians, 584 (22.7%) Romanians and 0.5% others.\n\n\"Borsec, Queen of Mineral Waters\" (since 1806) is bottled there and exported to nations such as Hungary, Italy, Germany, France, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Israel, South Africa, Sweden, Jordan, Greece, Lebanon, Emirates .\n\n"}

{"id": "1797530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797530", "title": "Terry Neill", "text": "Terry Neill\n\nWilliam John Terence Neill (born 8 May 1942) is a Northern Ireland former football player and manager. A former defender, he captained and later managed Arsenal, guiding the club to a European final in 1980 and three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980, winning a dramatic final against Manchester United in 1979. Before his seven-year spell as manager of Arsenal, he managed Hull City, Tottenham Hotspur and Northern Ireland on a part-time basis.\n\nBorn in Belfast, Neill played as a youth for Bangor, before moving in December 1959 to Arsenal. He spent a year in Arsenal's youth side, before making his debut against Sheffield Wednesday on 23 December 1960, aged eighteen. At first, he played sporadically during the early 1960s, getting between 10 and 20 games a season through the first half of the decade, though on one occasion he became the youngest Arsenal captain in the club's history at 20 years of age.\n\nPlaying either at centre half or wing half, Neill established himself in the side in 1964–65, with 29 league appearances, and as one of the younger members of Billy Wright's team, was kept by Wright's successor Bertie Mee when he took over in 1966. Neill became a first-choice player through the mid-sixties, playing over 40 games a season for three seasons in a row, and also playing in the 1968 Football League Cup Final against Leeds United, which Arsenal lost. Neill played no part in Arsenal's European Fairs Cup 1969–70 final win but he made five appearances earlier in the cup run.\n\nDuring this time, Neill had also become a regular for Northern Ireland, having made his debut as long back as 1961. He became captain of his country in 1968, but a bout of jaundice restricted his appearances for club and country in 1968–69 and he missed the 1969 Football League Cup Final, which Arsenal lost to Swindon Town. Unable to regain his first-team place, Neill only made 25 appearances in 1969–70 and it became clear that he was surplus to requirements at Arsenal. In total he played 275 times for Arsenal, scoring ten goals.\n\nAlthough still only 28, Neill was signed by Hull City in July 1970 as player-manager, one of the youngest ever managers in the history of the game; he later became player-manager of his country as well. Neill retired from playing in 1973, by which time he had won 59 caps for Northern Ireland, breaking Danny Blanchflower's record (though Pat Jennings would go on to break Neill's record in due course).\n\nNeill left Hull a year later to succeed Bill Nicholson as manager of Arsenal's fiercest rivals, Tottenham Hotspur. He managed Spurs for two seasons, narrowly avoiding relegation in his first term.\n\nHaving improved Tottenham Hotspur's fortunes with a 9th-place finish in his second season in charge, Neill was recruited by the Arsenal board to replace Bertie Mee on 9 July 1976 and at the age of 34 he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings, and a crop of talent in the side such as Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, the club enjoyed their best form since the 1971 double, reaching a trio of FA Cup finals (1978, 1979 and 1980).\n\nArsenal lost the other two FA Cup finals that Neill guided the club to, but were victorious in the 1979 final, with the Gunners winning 3–2 against Manchester United in one of the most exhilarating endings to an FA Cup final in history. In the 86th minute, Arsenal were leading 2–0. United scored two late goals to equalise. With the game poised for extra time, Alan Sunderland scored a last-minute winner for Arsenal to end the match 3–2.\n\nIn 1979, Neill came close, but was unsuccessful in his attempt to pull off a major transfer coup for Arsenal by signing Diego Maradona as a highly rated teenager from Argentinos Juniors. Neill also wanted to sign midfielder Glenn Hoddle from Spurs, but Hoddle had reservations about moving across North London to join his team's arch rival. Hoddle later said: \"I don't think my brother would have ever spoken to me again if I had joined Arsenal.\"\n\nNeill guided Arsenal to the 1980 final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. In the semi-final against Juventus, Arsenal drew 1–1 in the first leg at Highbury, and were expected to have a formidable task in the second leg in Turin. But a late goal two minutes from time by Arsenal's teenage substitute Paul Vaessen gave Arsenal a 1–0 away victory and a 2–1 aggregate win. It was the first time Juventus had lost to a British team on home soil. In the final, Arsenal lost on penalties to Valencia in front of 40,000 people at Heysel Stadium.\n\nArsenal's success in cup competitions could not be matched in the league. The retirement of Malcolm Macdonald at the premature age of 29 due to a knee injury, and the departures of stars such as Brady and Stapleton, hampered Arsenal's league title ambitions.\n\nIn the 1980–81 season, Neill guided Arsenal to a third-place finish in the final table – the closest in 10 years that they had come to winning the league title. In the 1981–82 season, Arsenal finished fifth in the league.\n\nNeill's 1982 summer signing of striker Lee Chapman from Stoke City for £500,000 was not a success, with Chapman scoring just 4 goals in 23 appearances for Arsenal before being sold to Sunderland for £200,000. In the 1982–83 season, Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the League Cup, but lost both semi-finals to Manchester United.\n\nIn June 1983, Neill signed striker Charlie Nicholas, from Celtic for £800,000. Liverpool and Manchester United had also been keen to buy Nicholas, who had scored an impressive total of 50 goals in all competitions for Celtic in the 1982–83 season. Nicholas reportedly became the highest paid footballer in Britain after his move to Arsenal, and later became a cult figure at the club.\n\nAfter being given an improved three-year contract at the start of the 1983–84 season, Neill was sacked by Arsenal on 16 December 1983. The dismissal was a decision which club chairman Peter Hill-Wood had reportedly agonised over.\nNeill subsequently retired from football when only 41 years old.\n\nNeill has since opened sports bars in Hendon and Holborn. He also commentates on Arsenal matches for Arsenal TV.\nNeill currently heads up the business development department of The Hub (London), a total media management company in the City. Politically, he is a Conservative.\n\n\"Scores and results list Northern Ireland's goal tally first. \"\nArsenal\n\n"}

In 1966, 16-year-old Peter Frampton joined as lead singer and guitarist. The band had three UK top twenty hits in the late 1960s, including \"From the Underworld\" and \"I Don't Want Our Loving to Die\", before Frampton left in 1968 to form Humble Pie with Steve Marriott. The band broke up shortly after, reforming briefly and unsuccessfully in 1971.\n\nThe Herd were founded in 1965 in south London, and recorded three unsuccessful singles with Parlophone. In 1966 three members in succession (Terry Clark, Louis Cennamo and Mick Underwood) quit the group and the group got the line-up that made it famous. The singer, Peter Frampton, was 16 when he joined the group in 1966 and had just left school. The other members were a few years older. Parlophone did not want to go on with them, but Fontana was willing to give them a try. They also sent their manager Billy Gaff away and brought in the songwriters/producers Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley instead. This pair had been largely responsible for a string of hits by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich.\n\nHoward and Blaikley orchestrated for them a unique blend of pop and flower power. After a UK Singles Chart near-miss with \"I Can Fly\" (April 1967), the haunting \"From the Underworld\", (August 1967) based on the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, reached Number 6 later that year with help from copious plays on pirate radio. It was a hit in other countries too. In the Netherlands the song reached Number 3. \"From the Underworld\" was followed by \"Paradise Lost\", (November 1967) which made it up to Number 15. In October 1967 they supported the Jimi Hendrix Experience at The Saville Theatre, London. Their greatest success came with \"I Don't Want Our Loving to Die\", (March 1968) a Number 5 UK hit single. \n\nWith his boyish photogenic looks, Frampton was dubbed \"The Face of ’68\" by teen magazine \"Rave\".\n\nThe last months of 1968 were tempestuous times for the group. Steele left the group, to be replaced by Henry Spinetti. The group dumped their managers Howard and Blaikley, and briefly found a new mentor in Harvey Lisberg who after three months found himself so bogged down with their personnel problems that he politely withdrew his services. Most songs on their first and only album \"Paradise Lost\" were written by Peter Frampton and Andy Bown, just like their next single, \"Sunshine Cottage\".\n\nDissatisfied with mere teen idol status, and disappointed with the failure of \"Sunshine Cottage\", Frampton left by the end of 1968 to form Humble Pie with Steve Marriott. The remaining members Bown, Spinetti and Taylor made another flop single, \"The Game\", then minus Taylor, formed the short-lived Judas Jump with Allan Jones, saxophonist from Amen Corner, and Welsh vocalist Adrian Williams. Taylor, who became a disc jockey, and Steele, reunited briefly for a one-off single \"You've Got Me Hangin' From Your Lovin' Tree\" in June 1971, to almost universal lack of interest. By the late 1970s Bown had become a member of UK rockers Status Quo and both Taylor and Spinetti joined up with Gerry Rafferty.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated along the banks of the Fen River. It has an area of and according to the 2010 Census, a population of 4,316,612 inhabitants of which 944,050 live in the built-up (or metro) area made up of Yaodu urban district. The GDP of Linfen ranked second in Shanxi Province. It was known as Pingyang () during the Spring and Autumn period. In 2006, the American Blacksmith Institute listed Linfen as one of the ten most polluted cities in the world.\n\nPrior to 1978, Linfen was famous for its spring water, greenery and rich agriculture and therefore nicknamed \"The Modern Fruit and Flower Town\". Since then it has been developing into a main industrial center for coal mining, which has significantly damaged the city's environment, air quality, farming, health and its previous status as a green village.\n\nLinfen is named for the Fen River. Its former names include Jin, Jinzhou, and Pingyang ().\n\nChinese archeologists have claimed that Yao's capital was located in Linfen, a confirmation of local legend responsible for the name of the city's Yaodu District. So, Linfen city is the earliest capital of China.\n\nThe area was the center of the marchland and duchy of Jin, named for the Jin River The duchy collapsed in the but gave its name to a Chinese princely title used as the dynastic name of the Sima clan. was centered on the town, which took its name as Jin and Jinzhou. Later, it was renamed , which was also adapted as the name for its chief town. The Xiongnu Chanyu Liu Cong made Pingyang his residence in the fourth century. \"He kept court at Pingyang in [Shanxi] and ruled over central and southern [Shanxi], over [Shaanxi] (except for the Han basin), northern [Henan] (except for Kaifeng), southern [Hebei], and northern [Shandong].\" In the 10th century, the city's walls were considered \"fortified beyond approach\".\n\nIn the 1980s, Linfen was nicknamed \"The Modern Fruit and Flower Town\".\n\nLinfen is located in the southwestern part of Shanxi, on the lower reaches of the Fen River, bounded by Changzhi and Jincheng to the east, the Yellow River to the west (which also forms the border with Shaanxi), Jinzhong and Lüliang to the north, and Yuncheng to the south. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 35° 23′ N to 36° 37′ N, spanning , and in longitude from 110° 22′ E to 112° 34′ E, spanning . In all, the city's administrative area, at , covers 13% of the province's area.\n\nWithin its borders Linfen City has a variety of topographical features. It is characterised as having a \"U\" shape, with its mountains, covering 29.2% of the prefectural area, on all four cardinal directions, a basin, the Linfen Basin (), covering 19.4%, in the middle, and intervening hills, covering 51.4%, in between. In the east, from north to south, are Mount Huo () and the Zhongtiao Mountains; in the west are the Lüliang Mountains, with elevations mostly above . The highest point in the prefecture is the main peak of Mount Huo, at , and the lowest is in Xiangning County, at . Important rivers in the area include the Yellow, Fen, Xinshui (), Qin (), Hui (), E (), and Qingshui Rivers ().\n\nThe whole prefecture-level city features a great variety of terrain. The city itself sits in a basin, which aggravates the pollution.\n\nLinfen has a continental, monsoon-influenced semi-arid climate (Köppen \"BSk\"), with moderately cold, but dry winters, and hot, somewhat humid summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . The annual precipitation stands at , with close to 70% of this total falling from June to September. The frost-free period lasts on average 190 days per year. Extreme temperatures have ranged from to .\n\nChina's rapid industrialization and urbanization beginning in the 1990s led to increased energy demand causing a dramatic increase in the price of coal. This led to a rapid expansion of loosely regulated private mines. Mining, cooking, smelting and other heavy industries which developed around the city have led to catastrophic environmental damage.\n\nIn 2006, the Blacksmith Institute included Linfen in its annual \"10 worst\" report, calling the city the most polluted city in China. It has also been listed as one of the world's ten dirtiest cities by the Popular Science website. The city has ranked at the bottom of the World Bank's air quality rankings.\n\nFrom its low point, in 2004, with only fifteen days out of the year with an acceptable level of air pollution, the environmental situation has improved. After a series of negative reports on the extreme level of pollution in the city, efforts were made to clean up Linfen. Substandard mines were closed. Coal trucks were kept from entering the city, resulting in much less coal dust. The city has also switched much of its heating source from coal to gas. 197 large coal-fired boilers and more than 600 smaller boilers were decommissioned. As of 2007, 85% of population used natural gas rather than coal for their heating. The State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) has forced many of the less-efficient smaller factories to close and enforced stricter standards for larger factories including mandating the installation of sulfur scrubbers.\n\nSince 2006, the government has taken a series of measures to modify industrial structure and economic development mode. Relevant policies was issued such as emission thresholds of industrial pollution. Over the last few years the Ministry of Environmental Protection has been closely monitoring Linfen's environment conditions. While the \"China Youth Daily\" reported in 2014 that Linfen experiencing the great change from the \"most polluted city\" to \"model city of environmental protection\", other sources suggest that little progress has been made in combatting pollution. In 2018, the Chinese government openly criticized the city's failure to meet pollution targets, and a 2019 report by the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment found that the city's air pollution was the worst among the 168 cities the ministry monitored. Following the report, the city's government ordered further pollution controls for the city's industry.\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Linfen is divided in one district, two cities and fourteen counties. The information here presented uses the metric system and data from 2010 Census.\n\nLinfen prefecture is home to several notable tourist attractions including the Hukou Waterfall which is the largest waterfall on the Yellow River and the second largest in China. Hukou Waterfall is located west of Linfen city in Jinshan Gorge.\n\nOther attractions are mostly located in Hongtong county. Most notable among these is Guangsheng Temple, built in 147 CE. Located in the upper Guangsheng temple is the Feihong Pagoda, the largest and best preserved glazed Chinese pagoda. Also in Hongdong county is the Su San Prison (), a restored Ming dynasty prison made famous by the Peking opera titled Yu Tang Chun (). It is China's oldest surviving prison. Dahuaishu Ancestor Memorial Garden is a shown for the mandatory population migration in early Ming Dynasty.\n\nLinfen recorded a population of approximately 4,508,400 people as of 2019, an increase of 80,100 from 2018. The city reported 2,414,700 urban residents, and 2,093,700 rural residents, giving the city a 53.56% urbanization rate.

Linfen's primary sector makes up 7.1% of the city's GDP, the secondary sector contributes 43.3% of the city's GDP, and the tertiary sector makes up 49.6% of the city's GDP.\n\nLinfen has rich mineral resources including coal, iron ore, copper, and lead. Hedong Coal Field, Huoxi Coal Field and Qinshui Coal Field together comprise 62.9 billion tons of coal reserves. Iron ore reserves exceed 420 million tons. Coal mining and dressing, coking, metallurgy, non-ferrous metal smelting, and chemicals are the principle industries.\n\nAfter a World Bank report in 2006 called Linfen \"the most polluted city in the world\", the local government began closing a number of mines and factories, costing the city's economy $300 million in 2007 alone. A number of industries also refitted their facilities to track and reduce pollution. The city's economy stagnated in the following years.\n\nLinfen Qiaoli Airport, in Yaodu district, was built in 1958 and closed in 1965. The airport has been under renovation since September 2010 and started operation on January 2016.\nOn May 21, 2020, Linfen Qiaoli Airport was officially renamed \"Linfen Yaodu Airport\"(临汾尧都机场).\n\nLinfen railway station, in Yaodu district, was built in 1935 on the important southern Tongpu railway.\n\nLinfen West railway station, in Yaodu district, was built in 2014. It is on the Datong–Xi'an high-speed railway. From this station, passengers can go to Beijing, Xi'an, Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang directly.\n\n\n\n"}

Until the 19th century, it was a separate town, but was eventually surrounded by the expanding Dundee. It is notable for being home to Camperdown Works, which was the largest jute production site in the world.\n\n'Lochee' originally referred to the area in which weavers' cottages were situated at the burn which flowed through Balgay Lochee; thus, they were at the eye of the loch or Loch E'e, which eventually became Lochee. It is believed this site is close to where Myrekirk stands today. Indeed, John Ainslie's map of 1794 makes reference to 'Locheye' on the north and south banks of the burn. However, G. Taylor and A. Skinner's 'Survey and maps of the roads of North Britain or Scotland' in 1776 makes reference to 'Lochee'.\n\nWhen the loch was drained by the Duncans in the 15th century they offered crofting tenancies along the burn. One of the tenancies went to a Dutchman, James Cox and his family. After a change of name and with a reputation for quality linen, the Cox family eventually set up as linen merchants in 1700.\n\nBy 1760 the firm had 300 weavers and after using steam power and moving into the jute industry the family built Camperdown Works in 1864, said to be the largest factory in the world, with over 5,000 employees. Cox’s Stack, the 86 m (282 ft) high campanile-style factory chimney designed by local architect James MacLaren, survives. Lochee became a company town with 2 railway stations, police force, fire service, schools, swimming pool, casino, library, washhouse and several churches.\n\nIn 1890 Cox Brothers donated a 25 acre public park to Lochee.\n\nLochee is well known for being the home of Dundee's biggest ever gang, 'The Lochee Fleet' who were notorious in Dundee's gang culture throughout the 70's and 90's.\n\nMany immigrants were attracted to the area by the prospect of employment in the city's jute mills. By 1855, there were 14,000 Irish immigrants in Dundee, most of whom stayed in Lochee, or 'Little Tipperary' as it would come to be known. In 1904, the Lochee Harp football club was formed by Lochee Irishmen as a means of recreation for the poor immigrants; the club still plays to this day.\n\nLochee is still regarded as Dundee's Irish 'quarter'.\n\nSee also \n\nFrancis Boag, artist\n\n Lochee | \"Scotland\"\n\n"}

Its Romanian name means \"blond\", the German name means \"copper mine\" while the Hungarian name means \"Balán mine.\"\n\nIt lies in the Ciuc Depression (Romanian Depresiunea Ciucului, ). It is surrounded by the Hășmaș Mountains (Hășmașul Mare and Hășmașul Mic). The town's altitude is 850 m; this rises to 1792 m at the highest peak of the Hășmaș Mountains. Bălan is crossed by the Olt River.\n\nThe temperate continental climate has an average temperature of 7˚C, falling to -10˚C in winter. There are 1300-1400 sunny hours per year. Wind gusts are rare due to the surrounding mountains and forests.\nMost of the forests around Bălan are spruce forests, but there are also fir, larch and maple forests. There are some flowers species in the area like edelweiss and sweet pea which are protected by law. In the forests there are some edible mushrooms species and fruits like blueberries, raspberries and cranberries.\n\nAccording to the census from 2011 it had a population of 5,864 of which 3,625 (61.82%) were Romanians, and 2,124 (36.22%) were Hungarians.\n\nBălan was the site of iron mining during the 17th century, but by 1702 the iron stores had been depleted. The copper deposits were discovered in 1785 by János Opra; production began in 1803, and by 1853 six mines were in operation. From that period, the village gradually began to develop into a town. Until 1967, Bălan remained part of the commune of Sândominic, finally gaining official town status in 1968. In 2006 all mining-related activities were stopped by the Romanian government and nowadays the city is counting on ecotourism and small businesses as main economical activities.\n\nBălan's main architectural site is the Roman Catholic Church, consecrated in 1869. Despite the environmental blight of the mining, the surrounding area is uncommonly beautiful, taking in the nearby mountains of Hășmașul Mare and Tarcău, the former a popular hiking destination.

Bradford's father left the family not long after his birth and his mother died so he was raised by foster parents. A talented footballer, Bradford signed for Glenavon F.C. as a teenager and his displays soon attracted the attentions of the English side Sheffield Wednesday F.C., who invited him to a trial. However, Bradford was not signed by the club and returned to Northern Ireland to resume his career with the then Belfast-based club Distillery.\n\nBradford gave up football in 1964, after deciding to train to become a Methodist minister. After spending the rest of the 1960s attached to congregations in East Belfast and Fivemiletown, Bradford was fully ordained in 1970 and given his own parish in the Suffolk area of southwest Belfast. Bradford later resigned from the Methodist ministry in the late 1970s after feeling that he and his fellow ministers were on divergent paths both politically and ecumenically. (Norah Bradford, A Sword Bathed in Heaven 1984:98) and would spend the final years of his life without a church. During these years he came to spend time in the 'Bible belt' of the US and became associated with American Evangelicalism. Nevertheless, Bradford claimed to always remain at heart a Methodist and also rejected suggestions that he was to join Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church (which he never did). \n\nBradford first became involved with unionism in 1971 when he joined the Orange Order. From here he became more involved in the political side of the movement and stood as a candidate for the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party in the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election in South Antrim, although he was not elected. Bradford was first elected as Member of Parliament for South Belfast in the February 1974 British general election, this time under the banner of the United Ulster Unionist Council (an alliance between the Vanguard, the Democratic Unionist Party and the anti-Brian Faulkner section of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) under Harry West), defeating the sitting MP Rafton Pounder, a pro-Faulkner Ulster Unionist. His campaign had been openly supported by the far-right National Front, and at a National Front rally September 1974, Martin Webster read out a letter of solidarity from Bradford.\n\nBradford greatly increased his majority in the October election, after Pounder dropped out, and largely maintained this increased majority in 1979. Between 1974 and 1978 he sat for the Vanguard Party until in February 1978 he joined the UUP (then often called the Official Unionist Party), along with Vanguard leader William Craig and most of the membership. He was re-elected in 1979 for the UUP.\n\nHe was described as a religious and political hardliner, identifying with British Israelism. In one of his speeches he said the causes of the problems in Northern Ireland were down to the Roman Catholic Church, Marxism, and ecumenical confusion.\n\nBradford was shot dead by the IRA on 14 November 1981 in a community centre in Finaghy, Belfast, while hosting a political surgery. Kenneth Campbell, the 29-year-old Protestant caretaker in the centre, was also murdered in the attack.\n\nSecretary of State Jim Prior was verbally abused and jostled by a group of angry loyalists outside the church at his funeral and hissed at by members of the congregation. Ian Paisley also protested against his attendance.\n\nTaoiseach Garret FitzGerald made an expression of sympathy in Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament of the Ireland) stating:\n\nThe IRA described him as \"one of the key people responsible for winding up the loyalist paramilitary sectarian machine\". A number of Catholics were killed by loyalists in retaliation.\n\nHis seat was won by Martin Smyth, also of the UUP, in a by-election in 1982. A book about Bradford's life, \"A sword bathed in heaven: The life, faith, and cruel death of the Rev. Robert Bradford B. Th. M.P.\" (1984), was written by his widow, Norah. It dealt largely with his path to Methodism, although also examined his political career and assassination.\n\n\n"}

This is similar to the grade crossing identifier number database compiled by the Federal Railroad Administration which identifies all railroad crossings. This bridge information includes the design of the bridge and the dimensions of the usable portion. The data is often used to analyze bridges and judge their conditions. The inventory is developed with the purpose of having a unified database for bridges to ensure the safety of the traveling public as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. It includes identification information, bridge types and specifications, operational conditions, bridge data including geometric data and functional description, and inspection data. Any bridge more than 20 feet (6 meters) long used for vehicular traffic is included.\n\nIdentification information addresses the bridge location uniquely and classifies the type of the routes carried out on and/or under the structure and locates the bridge within the spatial location. Each bridge is given a number by the highway department of the respective state or the agency that maintains the bridge. The method of assigning numbers differs from one state to the next, but provides a unique number for each bridge in the state.\n\nThe bridge inventory is developed for having a unified database for bridges including the identification information, bridge types and specifications, operational conditions, and bridge data including geometric data, functional description, inspection data, etc. Bridge type and specifications classify the type of the bridge. This part provides defined standard categories for classification of the bridges. It also identifies the material of the bridge components, deck and deck surface. Operational conditions provide information about the age of the structure as well as construction year, rehabilitation year, type of services and traffic carried over and/or under the structure number of the lanes over and/or under the bridges, average daily traffic, average daily truck traffic and information regarding to bypass, detours. Furthermore, the bridge inventory contains information regarding to inspection data, ratings assigned by inspectors and appraisal results.\n\nThe National Bridge Inventory (NBI) includes a structural evaluation of deck, superstructure, substructure, and culvert on a 0-9 scale:\nCode \"N\" (NOT APPLICABLE) is used for item 62 (Culvert Rating) when the structure is a bridge or for items 58, 59, and 60 (Deck, Superstructure Rating, Substructure Rating, respectively) when the structure is a (bridge length, i.e. 20 ft) culvert.\n\nThe term \"Functionally Obsolete\" has been removed from published NBI data, as it is no longer tracked. Prior to 2016 the term was a collective designation for bridges ranked as a code 3 or lower.\n\nThe NBI can classify bridges as \"Structurally Deficient\", which means that the condition of the bridge includes a significant defect, often meaning that speed or weight limits must be put on the bridge to ensure safety; a rating of 4 or lower on any of items 58, 59, 60, or 62 (Deck, Superstructure, Substructure, and Culverts, respectively) qualifies a bridge as \"structurally deficient\".\n\nIn December 2008, 72,868 bridges in the United States (12.1%) were categorized as \"structurally deficient\", representing an estimated $48 billion in repairs, and 89,024 (12.2%) were rated \"functionally obsolete\", representing an estimated $91 billion in replacement costs.\n\nSome bridges are also identified as \"fracture critical\", which means that the failure of a single major tension member or member element will cause a significant portion or the entire bridge to collapse due to a lack of redundancy. Fracture critical designs can leave bridges vulnerable to collisions with ships or large trucks, as in the I-5 Skagit River Bridge collapse.\n\nThe NBI was subjected to scrutiny and questions after new actions revealed it might be outdated or inaccurate. Federal officials attempted to order emergency inspections of all steel truss bridges after a major bridge collapse in Minneapolis in 2007. However, it was found that many records within the NBI were inaccurate or out of date.\n\nThe Inventory is used for federal funding purposes. A \"bridge sufficiency rating\" is calculated, based 55% on the structural evaluation, 30% on the obsolescence of its design, and 15% on its importance to the public. As of 2008, a score of 80 or less is required for federal repair funding, and 50 or less for federal replacement funding.\n\n\n"}

Reorganized as a private institution in 1942, it maintains close relationships with the governments and communities of the city and surrounding counties, as well as with the State of Maryland.\n\nThe Baltimore SO's modern history dates from 1965, when Baltimore arts patron Joseph Meyerhoff became president of the Orchestra, a position he held for 18 years. Meyerhoff appointed Romanian-born conductor Sergiu Comissiona as music director. Other music directors have included Yuri Temirkanov, music director from 20002006, who subsequently took the title of music director emeritus.\n\nIn September 2007, Alsop became the 12th music director of the Baltimore SO, having served as music director designate for the 2006–2007 concert season. The 2005 announcement of her appointment caused controversy, over reports that the orchestra players statements that they had not had enough voice in the search process. The orchestra and Alsop met after the announcement and smoothed over some of their differences. Alsop's contract was subsequently extended in 2009 and in 2013. In February 2020, the Baltimore SO announced that Alsop is to conclude her music directorship of the orchestra at the close of the 2020–2021 season, and to take the title of Music Director Laureate.\n\nIn February 2017, Peter T. Kjome became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the orchestra. The Baltimore SO's Principal Pops Conductor is Jack Everly. The orchestra's current BSO-Peabody conducting fellow is Michael Repper. In 2016, the BSO appointed Tonya McBride Robles as vice president and general manager.\n\nThe Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall has been the home of the Baltimore SO since its opening on September 16, 1982. Named for businessman and philanthropist Joseph Meyerhoff, the 2,443-seat hall has undergone renovations in 1990 and again in 2001.\n\nThe Orchestra's second home is the 1,976-seat Music Center at Strathmore, located in North Bethesda, Maryland. With the opening of the Music Center at Strathmore in February 2005, the Baltimore Symphony became the nation's first orchestra with year-round venues in two metropolitan areas. As the founding partner and resident orchestra of the Music Center, the Baltimore SO presents 35 performances in the concert hall annually.\n\nIn addition to its Baltimore and Strathmore residencies, the orchestra regularly performs in Frederick, its longest continuing run-out concert series, as well as at Chesapeake College in Wye Mills.\n\nThe Baltimore Symphony Orchestra has commissioned several works from American composers, which include:\n\nIn 1987, the Baltimore SO and its then-music director David Zinman undertook a concert tour of Europe and the Soviet Union. The Baltimore SO was the first American orchestra in 11 years to tour the Soviet Union after cultural relations resumed towards the end of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Under Zinman the orchestra made its first visits to Chicago and the Midwest in 1990 and to East Asia in 1994, with subsequent East Asia tours in 1997 and 2002. The Baltimore SO has often appeared at Carnegie Hall, including a February 2008 concert with the New York premiere of Steven Mackey's percussion concerto \"Time Release\" with soloist Colin Currie.\n\nThe BSO performs approximately 30 education concerts and open rehearsals each year for more than 60,000 area students in pre-school through 12th grade. Cornerstone initiatives include 'BSO on the Go', a program that brings small groups of BSO musicians into schools for interactive music education workshops at no cost to the schools, and 'Side-by-Side' concerts, which allow student musicians to rehearse and perform a full-length concert alongside BSO musicians. Rusty Musicians, a program geared towards adult amateur musicians, allows participants to join the BSO and perform under its conductor.\n\nIn May 2008, the BSO began OrchKids, an after-school program to provide music experience and education for youth in Baltimore City's low-income neighborhoods. In collaboration with community partners, it provides music education, instruments, meals and mentorship at no cost to the participants. OrchKids serves more than 400 students from pre-K through fifth grade at Lockerman Bundy Elementary School, New Song Academy, Mary Ann Winterling Elementary School and Highlandtown Elementary/Middle School. OrchKids maintains a faculty of 27 professional working/teaching musicians and academy classroom teachers. Business and community partners include Baltimore City Public Schools, The Peabody Institute, Baltimore School for the Arts, The Family League of Baltimore, University of Maryland Baltimore County and others. Lead funding support was provided by initial gifts of $100,000 from Marin Alsop and $1,000,000 from Rheda Becker and Robert Meyerhoff.\n\nThe OrchKids program aspires to provide Baltimore City's children tools to expand their opportunities for creativity, self-expression, cooperative learning, teamwork, academic success and self-esteem.\n\nThe BSO Academy is an annual intensive week-long study program that helps amateur musicians improve the skills through learning and performance with the BSO and its conductor. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has provided leadership support for the BSO Academy since 2012.\n\nGeared towards adult amateur musicians, \"Rusty Musicians with the BSO\" is a programme where for one evening, amateur musicians are invited to join members of the Baltimore SO on stage to rehearse and perform selected repertoire led by Marin Alsop. The first \"Rusty Musicians\" event was at Strathmore in February 2010, with more than 400 amateur musicians participating. The program was repeated at Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall in September 2010 with nearly 300 adult amateur participants.\n\nThe Baltimore Symphony Youth Orchestras (BSYO), formerly known as the Greater Baltimore Youth Orchestra, came under the umbrella of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 2012. It is made up of three different ensembles, categorized by age group and experience: the String Orchestra, the Concert Orchestra, and the Youth Orchestra. The BSYO performs at the George Washington Carver Center for Arts and Technology and the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall. The BSYO is led by artistic director Nicholas Hersh, who also conducts the Youth Orchestra.

Euxton Hall is now a private hospital and is made up of the lower ground floor of hall as the upper floor was demolished following a fire.\n\nCharles II lodged at Euxton Hall in 1651 when on his way south to Worcester, he is said to have drank water from the stream at the edge of Euxton describing it as \"Cul Beck\" or cool brook giving it its name, from whence the area takes its name.\n\nThe hall had three lodge houses, one at the bottom of Chapel Brow, one at main gates of Euxton Park on Wigan Road and one on Dawber's Lane which is now much extended and known as Dower House. The centre of the village later moved from the old ford to be closer to Euxton Hall and its chapel (now Euxton Parish Church).\n\nWhilst the oldest extant building is believed to be the parish church and although Euxton Hall is likely to be older in places, dating back to 1662, Armetriding Farm is believed to be the oldest dwelling house. However one of the most significant buildings is Buckshaw Hall, an H-plan two-storey timber framed property on a sandstone base, with both brick and wattle and daub infilling and a slate roof.\n\nEuxton Hall, which was a significant stately residence, now acts as a private hospital and is half its former glory, with the second storey being removed in the latter half of the 19th century along with its grand colonnade. Euxton Hall's 19th century gatehouses can be seen at the bottom of Chapel Brow, near the parish church whilst the other gatehouse can be seen at the entrance of Euxton Hall Gardens. Earlier gatehouses were previously located on Dawbers Lane and Runshaw Lane. Balshaw Lodge, which has recently been redeveloped, was originally built as guest lodgings for the hall.\n\nThere was a large Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF Chorley) built here in the buildup to the Second World War (Nevell \"et al.\", 1999). At its peak the factory employed over 40,000 people, and had its own railway station. It was probably the biggest munitions filling factory in the world, and it is said that the bouncing bombs used in the Dambusters raid were made there. ROF Chorley later came under the ownership of British Aerospace, and in subsequent years was closed down with the land being sold. In the early 2000s the former ROF Chorley site was effectively flattened and sanitised, so that the land could be transformed into the new Buckshaw Village.\n\nPlans by Tarmac to operate a sand quarry near the village were approved in August 2008 by a planning inspector. The quarry, to be located between Runshaw Lane and Dawber's Lane, had been proposed for ten years and is opposed by the village council, and by local residents, some of whom set up an action group, Euxton Residents Against Sand Extraction (ERASE), due to its impact on health, traffic and environment locally. The quarry has permission to operate for 15 years.\n\nEuxton is home to three listed railway bridges, Pincock Bridge, Old Station Bridge (Wigan Road) and Bay Horse Brow (Euxton Lane). There is also a bridge on School Lane.\n\nThe village also has seven public houses; the Talbot, the Euxton Mills, the Railway at Euxton, the Bay Horse, the Traveller's Rest, the Plough and the War Horse (in the Buckshaw part of Euxton). \n\nEuxton has several large housing estates, particularly in the eastern half of the village built in the late 1960s by Trevor Hemmings. The Talbot Estate lies to the east of Euxton and the Greenside Estate to the north on Runshaw Lane. \n\nNewer housing estates include Wentworth Drive to the north-east of the village and Church Walk and Park Avenue to the west.\n\nEuxton has two railway stations. It's connected to Liverpool and Preston via the West Coast Main Line at Euxton Balshaw Lane railway station and to Chorley and Manchester via Buckshaw Parkway railway station.\n\nIn 1997, Euxton Balshaw Lane railway station was re-opened after a gap of some 30 years. It is on the Preston - Wigan West Coast Main Line. The nearby station, Buckshaw Parkway was opened in 2011 to serve the new Buckshaw Village development, and is on the Preston - Manchester line.\n\nIn addition Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire operate the Route 109 through the village to provide a connection to Chorley, Leyland, Clayton-le-Woods and Preston. The Route 10, 11, 12 and 16 also ran through Euxton until 2012. Stagecoach also planned to extend the Route 111 to Chorley via Euxton, however these plans were abandoned after Lancashire County Council removed funding. The Route 109/A passed through the north of Euxton past Runshaw College, but was axed following a claim from Stagecoach that too few paying passengers used it.\n\nPreston Bus operate the Route 347 to Southport bi-hourly on weekdays.\n\nThe former ROF Chorley sports ground was used by English Championship football team Bolton Wanderers as its training headquarters. On 19 February 2016, the training facility was sold by Bolton Wanderers to Wigan Athletic.\n\nThe village is also home to Euxton Corinthians F.C., Euxton Villa F.C., Euxton Girls F.C. and Euxton Cricket Club. Euxton Villa F.C. have a training ground on Runshaw Lane.\n\n\n\n"}

The film's screenplay was written by Agnes Christine Johnston based on the novel by George Barr McCutcheon, and set on the fictional land of Graustark. The film features a final sequence in Technicolor. It was the first film by Sidney Franklin for MGM.\n\nThe story was filmed before in 1914 by the Biograph Company.\n\nCopies of the film are held at Turner Broadcasting and the Library of Congress.\n\nBeverly Calhoun (Davies) impersonates the Prince of Graustark to claim his birthright while he recovers from a skiing injury. In the meantime, she falls for her bodyguard Dantan (Moreno).\n\n\nIn her 22nd film, Marion Davies starred in yet another dual role as the American Beverly Calhoun who masquerades as her cousin Oscar, who happens to be the Prince of Graustark, a small European monarchy. This was the second time that Davies masqueraded as a male (see Little Old New York), and critics and audiences applauded the effort. The film is often cited as Davies' most profitable film because of low production costs and big box office. The only problem in filming was Davies' 10-day bout with the flu. This was her first teaming with Antonio Moreno, who played the royal bodyguard. The film boasted a 2-strip Technicolor finale (which survives). Davies' severe haircut, dubbed the \"Beverly Bob,\" caused a fashion craze.\n\n\n"}

In a 1920 tournament in Berlin he finished first (+6−2=1) ahead of Efim Bogoljubov, Savielly Tartakower, Richard Réti, Géza Maróczy, and Siegbert Tarrasch. Breyer had a plus record against Max Euwe (later world champion).\n\nIn 1921 Breyer set a new blindfold chess record by playing 25 games simultaneously. He also edited \"Szellemi Sport\", a magazine devoted to chess puzzles, and composed at least one brilliant retrograde analysis study.\nHeart disease cut short Breyer's promising chess career. He died in 1921 at the age of 28 in Bratislava. He was buried in Bratislava and after exhumation in 1987, was reburied in the Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest.\n\nBreyer was a leading pioneer of the hypermodern school of chess theory, which favoured controlling the with pressure from the . He is noted for the maxim \"after the first move 1.e4 White's game is in the last throes\", although Breyer himself did not abandon that move.

The property is situated on two islands in the middle of the Delaware River and was owned by the Cradle of Liberty Council. Treasure Island was the oldest continually operated Boy Scout Camp in the country and had been continuously associated with Scouting since 1913.\n\nIn April 2005, storms caused some of the highest flooding since 1955. As a result, Treasure Island was closed to summer campers in 2005 for the first time in twenty-five years. The council spent more than $1-million to rehabilitate the camp in preparation for reopening in June 2006. On June 28, 2006, the camp was once again inundated. While its long-term future was in doubt, it opened again successfully in 2007 and 2008. However, on September 10, 2008, the Council Executive Board voted to close Treasure Island for the 2009 season, the camp remained closed for the 2010 season and is now permanently shuttered.\n\nIt was announced on March 2, 2018 that Treasure Island was sold to Haubert Outdoor Oriented Adventure Hospitality, LLC, a family-owned business that intends to re-open the historic property as a commercial family campground. Once re-opened, Haubert will make Treasure Island available to Scouts free of charge.\n\nAmong the important buildings on the island are the Kiwanis Lodge (HandiCraft), the Klein Lodge (nature), the Health Lodge, the Trading Post, and \"City Hall\", which was the main office in control of Treasure Island. During the summer, most of the lodges were used for merit badge instruction. There is also the Goodman Stockade, where the opening campfires are held on Sunday nights, and the Ceremonial Grounds, where the Order of the Arrow ceremonies and the Friday night closing campfire were held. he stone fixtures of the Ceremonial Grounds, where the Order of the Arrow ceremonies were held, were excavated, transported, and reassembled at a new location within the Summit Bechtel Scout Reserve in West Virginia.\n\nTreasure Island has a swimming pool, and boating was conducted in canoes, rowboats and Sunfish sailboats on the west side of the island at the Boathouse.\n\nTube rafting was offered to Scouts during the summer, and scouts floated downstream to Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania, where they were driven by bus back up to the mainland across from Treasure Island, and taken by a boat back to the island.\n\nBike and canoe trips in the surrounding area were also conducted along the old Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal. Climbing and rappelling trips also took place at Ralph Stover State Park.\n\nJust to the north of Treasure Island lies Marshall Island (also known as Eagle Island). Marshall Island is connected to Treasure Island only by a small footbridge. Treasure Island is in New Jersey, whereas Marshall Island is in Pennsylvania. Because of this, the archery and rifle Ranges were sited on Marshall Island because New Jersey state gun laws are more stringent.\n\nThere is a path leading from the archery and rifle ranges that runs north and branches off in two directions. The branch to the left leads to a series of abandoned buildings and an abandoned field, remaining from when Eagle Island operated as a separate camp (Camp Wilson) in the 1970s. The right branch leads to unused campsites and the C.O.P.E. course.\n\nIn 1915 the Order of the Arrow (OA) was founded at Treasure Island by the Camp Director, E. Urner Goodman, and Assistant Camp Director Carroll A. Edson. The W. W. W. (the original name of the OA in the Lenni Lenape language) was designed as a camp honor fraternity that would emphasize the ideals of Scouting through the use of ceremonies and American Indian lore. At the beginning of the camping season, Goodman explored the island to find a suitable site for the Council Fire and for the rituals of his new program. A natural amphitheater was chosen on the south side of the island that was secluded from the rest of the camp. On the day of the first induction campfire, July 16, 1915, Goodman and one of his staff members, Harry A. Yoder, cleared the brush for the new ceremonial grounds, built the altar, and cut a trail leading from the camp. This new ceremonial ring continued to be used for OA ceremonies and for the camp's campfire programs until Treasure Island closed. At the end of the camping season that year, the new Order contained twenty-five members who selected the totem and names for Unami Lodge.\n\n"}

Despite being commercially unsuccessful, the group's first single, \"Good Life\", led to oldest sister Toni Braxton's solo career. All five members reunited in 2011 to star in the WE tv reality television series \"Braxton Family Values\" alongside their mother, Evelyn Braxton.\n\nIn October 2015, the group released the album \"Braxton Family Christmas\".\n\nThe Braxtons' parents are Rev. Michael Braxton Sr. (born June 26, 1947) and Evelyn Braxton (born January 14, 1948). Toni Michelle Braxton was born on October 7, 1967. Michael Conrad Braxton Jr., the only son, was born on November 17, 1968, then Traci Renee Braxton was born on April 2, 1971. Towanda Chloe Braxton was born on September 18, 1973. The Braxtons' fifth child, Trina Evette Braxton, was born on December 3, 1974. The youngest sibling, Tamar Estine Braxton, was born on March 17, 1977. They are originally from Severn, Maryland.\n\nThe sisters began to harmonize together when a then five-year-old Tamar demanded, \"somebody get me some toilet paper!\" Each sister and brother Michael soon after went in the bathroom and began singing the \"Toilet Paper Song\". The Braxtons credit this incident as their first song-writing experience and the first time that they harmonized as a group. Growing up, they sang in the choir at several churches and toured the East Coast with their religious parents singing at various events.\n\nToni, Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar Braxton signed their first record deal with Arista Records in 1989. In 1990, they released their first single, \"Good Life\". It would be their only single as a quintet. \"Good Life\" was not a hit, peaking at No. 79 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. At the time of the single's release, the members' age differences created a problem with marketing. Subsequently, The Braxtons were dropped from Arista Records.\n\nIn 1991, during a showcase with Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid and Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, who were in the process of forming LaFace Records, Toni Braxton, minus her four sisters, was chosen and signed as the label's first female solo artist. At the time, the remaining members were told that LaFace was not looking for another girl group since it had just signed TLC.\n\nAfter Toni's departure from the group in 1991, the remaining Braxtons members became backup singers for Toni's first U.S. tour, music videos, and promotional appearances. Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar were featured in the music video for Toni Braxton's third single, \"Seven Whole Days\", from her debut album.\n\nIn 1993, LaFace Records A&R Vice President, Bryant Reid, signed The Braxtons to LaFace. However, the group never released an album or single for the record label. When Reid moved on to work for Atlantic Records, he convinced executives at LaFace to allow him take the group to Atlantic also. They signed with Atlantic Records in 1994, with a 3-album deal.\n\nIt was reported in Vibe magazine that in 1995, Traci Braxton had left the group to pursue a career as a youth counselor. However, it was not confirmed until 2004 when Towanda Braxton appeared in season 2 of the reality show \"Starting Over\", that Traci was not allowed to sign with Atlantic because of her pregnancy at the time.\n\nIn June 1996, Tamar, Trina, and Towanda returned with a new album entitled \"So Many Ways\", which shared the same title as its lead single. Released on August 13, 1996, the album peaked at No. 26 on the \"Billboard\" R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It became their first and only LP. Atlantic Records A&R VP, Bryant Reid, served as the album's executive producer. At the time of its release, Reid told \"Billboard Magazine\", \"I had a vision for them then that was about young sophistication with sex appeal.\" \"So Many Ways\" included production from Jermaine Dupri and Daryl Simmons along with Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and Sean \"Sep\" Hall. The album also included a cover of Diana Ross's hit \"The Boss\" and Klymaxx's song \"I'd Still Say Yes\".\n\nThe Braxtons released a music video in order to promote \"So Many Ways\". It was directed by Cameron Casey and featured upcoming actor Mekhi Phifer. The trio also performed a remixed version of \"So Many Ways\" with rapper Jay-Z on September 9, 1996 at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards. The single was also used as the opening track for the soundtrack to the comedy film \"High School High\". \"So Many Ways\" went on to peak at No. 83 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in 1996, No. 22 on the Billboard R&B Charts and number 32 on the UK Singles Chart in January 1997.\n\nThe album's second single, \"Only Love\", was released on January 25, 1997 and peaked at number 52 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart. A music video for this song was also released. A Masters at Work remix version of The Braxtons third single The Boss\" reached number 1 on \"Billboard\" Dance/Club Play Chart in early 1997. \"Slow Flow\" was the final single released from So Many Ways. It peaked at No. 26 on the UK Charts in July 1997, becoming their highest charting single in the UK.\n\nThe Braxtons also served as the opening act for Toni Braxton on the European Leg of her Secrets Tour in 1997.\n\nThe Braxtons decided to part ways as a group after lead singer Tamar Braxton left to pursue a solo career with DreamWorks Records in 1999. However, the members continued to sing and act in various other projects. There was a lot of drama surrounding the situation, which is part of the reason why Towanda went on Starting Over. She had caught wind of Tamar's signing of a contract through industry insiders rather than Tamar herself. This notably caused tension between the group, due to them planning on doing a second album, with the inclusion of Traci, that time around.\n\nTrina appeared in the 2004 Tyler Perry play \"Meet the Browns\" as Tracy Stevens. She was also part of the play \"Rise\", written by Salt from Salt-n-Pepa and Christopher \"Play\" Martin from the rap group Kid 'n Play and starred in an off-Broadway production of \"Dreamgirls\" as Deena Jones. In 2004, Trina Braxton appeared in \"The Walk\" with Eva Pigford and Vanessa Bell. Additionally, she co-starred in two independent films, including \"Jail Party\", and was host for the unbroadcast \"Urban Idol\" for UPN. She also made a cameo in Tyler Perry's \"I Can Do Bad All By Myself\" as a member of a band performing with singer Mary J. Blige's character. In 2009, Trina joined the wedding band \"Simply Irresistible\" as a lead vocalist. In 2012, Trina left the band to pursue a solo music career, releasing her debut solo single \"Party or Go Home\" in March 2012.\n\nTrina and Tamar performed as background singers and dancers for the entire duration of Toni's Libra Tour in 2006. They also performed in \"Toni Braxton: Revealed\" at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino until R&B singer Sparkle and Towanda Braxton replaced them. \n\nTowanda Braxton appeared in season 2 of the reality show \"Starting Over\". She performed and recorded a solo song, \"Here I Am\", for the show and conducted a radio interview on the \"Wendy Williams Experience\" about her time on \"Starting Over.\" Towanda is also a member of Zeta Phi Beta sorority and pledged at Bowie State University in 1995. In September 2005, \"People\" magazine's website reported that Towanda was pregnant.\n\nTamar Braxton released her debut solo album \"Tamar\" in 2000. She also made a cameo in the music video for \"He Wasn't Man Enough\". She appeared for a short time as Sasha in the stage play version of \"Madea Goes to Jail\" in 2005 alongside Tyler Perry and Cassi Davis. Tamar co-wrote several songs and sang background vocals for several of Toni's albums including \"Snowflakes\", \"More Than a Woman\", \"Libra\", and \"Pulse\". In 2012, Tamar released the single \"Love and War\", followed by two albums in 2013: a studio album entitled \"Love and War\", followed by a Christmas album entitled \"Winter Loversland\".\n\nIn 2010, The Braxtons, including Traci Braxton, appeared in sister Toni Braxton's music video for her dance single \"Make My Heart\".\n\nIn January 2011, WE tv confirmed that it had signed Toni Braxton and her sisters, Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar for a reality series, entitled \"Braxton Family Values\", to be marketed as one of the network's flagship shows. The show looks at the relationship between Toni, her mom, and her sisters along with the interpersonal relationships of each family member. After only four episodes, the series had renewed for a second season. There would be 13 more one-hour episodes of \"Braxton Family Values\" on WE tv in 2012, up from 10 during the debut season – which was later upped to a 26 episode second season, including the Reunion Show.\n\nAs of the second season finale of \"Braxton Family Values\", it is still unclear whether or not the EP that The Braxtons were working on will be released. During the show's reunion, Toni Braxton stated that she thought The Braxtons should \"feature on [her] record\" instead of her completely rejoining the group for a full EP.\n\nThe Braxtons posed for the June 2011 \"VIBE magazine\" summer swimwear issue. They also presented the \"Best Gospel Artist\" award to Mary Mary at the 2011 BET Awards.\n\nIn July 2014, a sneak peek of the fourth season of \"Braxton Family Values\" was uploaded via YouTube on WE tv's user account of the Braxton sisters discussing on doing a gospel record together. In the same time, Toni, Tamar and Trina guest starred on their sister Traci's music video \"Last Call\".\n\nIn October 2015, the group including Toni, Tamar, Traci, Trina and Towanda, released an album titled \"Braxton Family Christmas\" as five members. The album was released on October 30 and pre-order on October 16. \"Braxton Family Christmas\" debuted at number 27 on the US \"Billboard\" R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, number 10 on the US R&B Chart and number 12 on US Top Holiday Albums on November 21, 2015. The album charted at number 1 on the US Heatseekers Albums on December 12, 2015.\n\n\n"}

It is the home of the Silver Age version of the Flash (Barry Allen), and first appeared in \"Showcase\" #4 in September–October 1956.\n\nCentral City's location has been vaguely defined over the years, similar to DC's other fictional cities such as Gotham City and Metropolis. In the 1970s, Central City was stated as being located in Ohio, where the real-world city of Athens, Ohio, would be (as shown in \"Flash\" #228 in 1974). Bob Rozakis' Ask the Answer Man column also stated that Central City was located in Ohio in 1987's \"Flash\" (volume 2) #2, published just after the reality-altering storyline \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\".\n\nMore recently, Central City has most often been located in the state of Missouri. Maps in Young Justice place Central City in Missouri across from Keystone City, Kansas. Additionally, the 2014 television series \"The Flash\" also places Central City in Missouri (although opening scenes show Portland, Oregon), most explicitly in a letter sent to S.T.A.R. Labs in the episode \"The Man in the Yellow Suit.\" Portland, Oregon is also the city-scape in the episode \"Flash vs The Arrow\" in season 1 of the series.\n\nIn the episode \"Bloodlines\" of the Young Justice cartoon, (a facsimile of) the St. Louis Gateway Arch can be seen in the background of scenes depicting Central City.\n\nCentral City's population has been depicted as dynamic over the years. In \"Flash\" v2, #2 (1987) it was cited as being 290,000. In 1990, the \"Atlas of the DC Universe\" listed it as 750,000. As of \"Flash Secret Files and Origins 2010\", the population stands as 1,395,600. In \"Flash\" v.4 # 1, Central City Police Captain Darryl Frye is quoted as describing the population as having \"tripled\" during Barry Allen's years-long absence.\n\nCaitlin Snow mentioned the city population as 14,000,000 in The Death of Vibe episode of The Flash (Season 5, episode 3 of the 2014 TV series).\n\nFrom 1956 until approximately 1985 (in publishing years), Central City was defended by the Flash (police scientist Barry Allen) against a myriad of foes, including Gorilla Grodd, Captain Cold, the Weather Wizard, the Mirror Master, and Eobard Thawne (The \"Reverse-Flash\").\n\nAfter Barry's death in \"Crisis on Infinite Earth\", most of his foes, as well as Barry's successor (and former sidekick) Wally West moved to Keystone City, which thanks to the reality-altering effects of \"Crisis on Infinite Earth\", was now Central City's twin city (pre-\"Crisis on Infinite Earth\", Keystone City was located on the parallel Earth known as Earth-Two, in approximately the same space as Central City). Subsequently, Central City was treated as a relatively quiet venue that was not frequently depicted in DC comic book stories, but this situation has changed as a result of Barry Allen's recent return as the Flash.\n\nNot long after Allen's death, in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #4 (August 1987), Central City was depicted as experiencing a wave of racial violence, caused or at least exacerbated by politician and white supremacist W. James Heller; in his costumed identity of supposed super-hero William Hell, Heller captured only non-white criminals (creating the false impression that non-whites were primarily responsible for Central City's criminal activity) and recruited white criminals for his \"Aryan Empire\" organization. When Heller attempted to incite further violence at a political rally, Suicide Squad member Deadshot impersonated William Hell to oppose Heller's racist rhetoric, turning Heller's own charade against him, since the costumed \"hero\" proved more popular with the public than any politician. Heller quickly donned his costume to, as William Hell, denounce Deadshot/Hell as an impostor, and in the ensuing conflict, William Hell (Heller) was wounded and his injuries blamed on Heller's followers, partially defusing Central City's racial strife.\n\nThe robotic superhero and former Teen Titans member Cyborg has moved to Central City; part of this is hoping to establish himself as the town's resident hero.\n\nDuring the years in which the second \"Flash\" series was written by Cary Bates, Central City was apparently divided into Upper and Lower East and West Sides, as well as a \"downtown\" region.\n\nCentral City is the home of the Flash Museum, a museum dedicated to the exploits and memorabilia of the city's hero.\n\nCentral City's main newspaper is the \"Central City Citizen\" (previously the \"Central City Picture-News\"), for which Barry's wife Iris West Allen is currently once again a reporter after an absence of several years.\n\nCentral City is home to the \"Central City Cougars\", an American Football team who is a member of the NFL's AFC Central Division.\n\nAs seen in \"Flash\" Vol. 2 #177, it has developed a thriving theatre district, second only to New York City.\n\nLater, much of downtown was demolished by the Rogues, acting under the orders of the other-dimensional Crime Syndicate. Due to a miscommunication and the Rogues' own decency, only property was damaged, they avoided taking lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During the late 19th century, the post served as a centre for trading activities, including the illegal whisky trade. The sale of whisky was outlawed but, due to the lack of law enforcement in the region prior to 1874, many whisky traders had settled in the area and taken to charging unusually high prices for their goods.\n\nFort Whoop-Up is also the name of a replica site and interpretive centre built in Indian Battle Park.\n\nFort Hamilton was first built in 1869 by John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton—two traders who had done business in the Fort Benton area of Montana and in the basin of the Upper Missouri—to serve as a trading post. Fort Hamilton was originally a group of 11 cabins. The traders in these cabins traded for $50,000 worth of buffalo robes in just six months of operations. This first fort was destroyed by fire within a year of its construction by an overturned lamp. Whether this was an accident or deliberate arson is unknown.\nHealy and Hamilton contracted James Gladstone and a crew of 30 workers to construct a second, more secure fort, which was later nicknamed \"Fort Whoop-Up\". It took two years to build at a cost of $25,000. When it was finished, Fort Whoop-Up was \"a squared timber post complete with a stockade, cannon-mounted bastions, loopholes for firing rifles, and three wickets for trading with the aboriginals.\" According to Healy, the new fort was built with six thousand cottonwood logs.\n\nFort Whoop-Up was located at the junction of the Belly (Oldman) River and the St. Mary's River, south of where the Fort Whoop-Up interpretive centre is located.\n\nOne type of alcohol sold by the whisky traders in and around Whoop-Up bandits was known as \"Whoop-Up Bug Juice\", a highly prized alcohol spiked with ginger, molasses, and red pepper. It was then coloured with black chewing tobacco, watered down, and boiled to make \"firewater\".\n\nThe spread of American traders from Fort Benton north into Canada was spurred by the enforcement of prohibition in Montana in 1869. Traders, like Healy and Hamilton, brought their stockpile of whisky to Canada to continue their lucrative trade. While whisky was a foundational trading item at Fort Whoop-Up and other trading posts, there was much legal trading that occurred, such as trading blankets, food, firearms, or ammunition for buffalo robes.\n\nThe outlaws of Fort Whoop-Up and surrounding areas—combined with the supposed flying of an American flag over Canadian territory—contributed to the formation of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP). Fort Whoop-Up was a destination on their march west in 1874.\n\nThe NWMP arrived at Fort Whoop-Up in October 1874, with the task of establishing Canadian sovereignty in the territory and controlling the alcohol trade. They found no whisky on the premises and the flag that had been reported as an American flag was inspected and found to be a trade flag for the fort (later adopted by the City of Lethbridge as the municipal flag). Finding no reason to close the fort, they continued further west and the fort continued in the trade of legal goods.\n\nTheir first strike on the alcohol traders came after a Peigan chief named Three Bulls complained at Fort Macleod about a group of whisky traders who had sold him overpriced whisky. Shortly after, the NWMP caught and fined the perpetrators, although they were not at Fort Whoop-Up at the time. Although the presence of the NWMP decreased the abundance of whisky trading, it still occurred.\n\nIn 1875, the NWMP rented a room from the owners of the fort, Healy and Hamilton, and established a post there. This arrangement lasted for at least twelve years, the fort acting as both a trading post and a NWMP post. The following year, Healy and Hamilton sold the fort to Dave Akers, who was in control of the fort almost until its demise. The fort was again burned in 1888, the fire having started in the NWMP barracks. This fire was not as severe as only the NWMP barracks were destroyed. The fort remained in operation until it was deserted somewhere between 1890 and 1892. It was then destroyed piece by piece until the last of it was washed away in a flood in 1915.\n\nOn 28 June 1985 Canada Post issued 'Fort Whoop Up, Alta.' one of the 20 stamps in the \"Forts Across Canada Series\" (1983 & 1985). The stamps are perforated 12½ x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited based on the designs by Rolf P. Harder.\n\nThere are several theories as to why the fort was nicknamed Whoop-Up. The most prominent is that it came by a description of the illicit activities that were taking place at the fort; that people said they were going to Fort Hamilton to whoop it up. Another theory comes from the process of getting a bull train moving over the trail. The bull whacker would walk alongside the bull train and crack his whip. This process was called whooping them up, which may have led to naming the trail from Fort Benton, Montana the Whoop-Up Trail, and hence the fort as well.\n\nA reconstruction—effort was undertaken to adapt the fort to what it was originally, based on new photographic evidence. The replica site was built as a centennial project, downstream from the original site, in 1967. Since then, various new exhibits have been unveiled, including the Thunderchief Collection, showcasing artifacts from the local Blackfoot culture; the Shockley Firearms Gallery; and \"Voice from the Past\", an audio program that enables visitors and school children to receive guided tours year round. Seasonal re-enactments take place in the summer involving characters from the fort's history, and are done in partnership with Drama Nutz Productions and Guns of the Golden West, as well as local re-enactment talent.\n\n"}

The short was reworked as the 1971 theatrical feature \"THX 1138\".\n\nIn 2010, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nIn an underground city in a dystopian future, the protagonist, whose name is \"THX 1138 4EB\", is shown running through passageways and enclosed spaces. It is soon discovered that THX is escaping his community. The government uses computers and cameras to track down THX and attempt to stop him; however, they fail. He escapes by breaking open a door and runs off into the sunset. The government sends their condolences to YYO 7117, THX's mate, claiming that THX has destroyed himself.\n\nThe USC program guide accompanying the film describes it as a \"nightmare impression of a world in which a man is trying to escape a computerized world which constantly tracks his movements\".\n\nLucas had had an idea for a long time \"based on the concept that we live in the future and that you could make a futuristic film using existing stuff\". Fellow USC students Matthew Robbins and Walter Murch had a similar idea which Robbins developed into a short treatment, but Robbins and Murch lost interest in the idea, whereas Lucas was keen to persist.\n\nOne of Lucas' USC instructors suggested an opportunity for Lucas to make the short film that he had in mind: since the 1940s, the USC film school had had a working arrangement with the US Navy, whereby Navy filmmakers attended USC for additional study. Teaching the class was not popular amongst USC staff, as the Navy filmmakers often had rigid, preconceived ideas about filmmaking, and sometimes misbehaved in class. But the Navy paid for unlimited color film, and lab processing costs, for their students. Lucas offered to teach the class, and was allowed the opportunity.\n\nThe Navy men formed the crew of the film, and some appeared in the cast. Because of the Navy connection, Lucas was able to access filming locations which would not otherwise have been available to him: the USC computer center, a parking lot at UCLA, the Los Angeles International Airport, and the Van Nuys Airport. Much of the filming was done at night, with some on weekends.\n\nThe film was completed in 12 weeks, with Lucas editing it on the Moviola at the home of Verna Fields, where he was working during the day editing United States Information Agency films under Fields' supervision.\n\nAn eclectic soundtrack includes organ music from Bach's Passacaglia in C minor and modified excerpts from Virgil Fox Plays the John Wanamaker Grand Court Organ.\n\nIn January 1968, the film won first prize in the category of Dramatic films at the third National Student Film Festival held at the Lincoln Center, New York, where it was seen and admired by Steven Spielberg, who had not previously met Lucas. It also came to notice of parts of the mainstream film industry, such as Los Angeles Times film critic Charles Champlin, and Ned Tanen, then a Universal Studios production executive, who was later involved with Lucas' \"American Graffiti\".\n\nIn 1971, Lucas re-worked the short as a theatrical feature, \"THX 1138\". The last act of the feature-length \"THX 1138\" roughly corresponds with the events in this film. In the final scene, people are warned not to exit the underground city through the door, which allegedly leads to death. In truth, the exit leads to their freedom. Cosmetically, there are similarities in coloring and appearance, although one noticeable difference is the actors did not have to shave their heads for the short film, unlike the later feature version.\n\nThe film became widely available on the bonus disc of the 2004 \"George Lucas Director's Cut\" DVD release of \"THX 1138\", and later on the Blu-ray release. The film also exists as a 16mm reference print and on videocassette with a run time of 15 minutes.\n\n"}

To this end, supercomputers are often employed to study black holes, gravitational waves, neutron stars and many other phenomena governed by Einstein's theory of general relativity. A currently active field of research in numerical relativity is the simulation of relativistic binaries and their associated gravitational waves. Other branches are also active.\n\nA primary goal of numerical relativity is to study spacetimes whose exact form is not known. The spacetimes so found computationally can either be fully dynamical, stationary or static and may contain matter fields or vacuum. In the case of stationary and static solutions, numerical methods may also be used to study the stability of the equilibrium spacetimes. In the case of dynamical spacetimes, the problem may be divided into the initial value problem and the evolution, each requiring different methods.\n\nNumerical relativity is applied to many areas, such as cosmological models, critical phenomena, perturbed black holes and neutron stars, and the coalescence of black holes and neutron stars, for example. In any of these cases, Einstein's equations can be formulated in several ways that allow us to evolve the dynamics. While Cauchy methods have received a majority of the attention, characteristic and Regge calculus based methods have also been used. All of these methods begin with a snapshot of the gravitational fields on some hypersurface, the initial data, and evolve these data to neighboring hypersurfaces.\n\nLike all problems in numerical analysis, careful attention is paid to the stability and convergence of the numerical solutions. In this line, much attention is paid to the gauge conditions, coordinates, and various formulations of the Einstein equations and the effect they have on the ability to produce accurate numerical solutions.\n\nNumerical relativity research is distinct from work on classical field theories as many techniques implemented in these areas are inapplicable in relativity. Many facets are however shared with large scale problems in other computational sciences like computational fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, and solid mechanics. Numerical relativists often work with applied mathematicians and draw insight from numerical analysis, scientific computation, partial differential equations, and geometry among other mathematical areas of specialization.\n\nAlbert Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1915. It, like his earlier theory of special relativity, described space and time as a unified spacetime subject to what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These form a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). After more than 100 years since the first publication of the theory, relatively few closed-form solutions are known for the field equations, and, of those, most are cosmological solutions that assume special symmetry to reduce the complexity of the equations.\n\nThe field of numerical relativity emerged from the desire to construct and study more general solutions to the field equations by approximately solving the Einstein equations numerically. A necessary precursor to such attempts was a decomposition of spacetime back into separated space and time. This was first published by Richard Arnowitt, Stanley Deser, and Charles W. Misner in the late 1950s in what has become known as the ADM formalism. Although for technical reasons the precise equations formulated in the original ADM paper are rarely used in numerical simulations, most practical approaches to numerical relativity use a \"3+1 decomposition\" of spacetime into three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time that is closely related to the ADM formulation, because the ADM procedure reformulates the Einstein field equations into a constrained initial value problem that can be addressed using computational methodologies.\n\nAt the time that ADM published their original paper, computer technology would not have supported numerical solution to their equations on any problem of any substantial size. The first documented attempt to solve the Einstein field equations numerically appears to be Hahn and Lindquist in 1964, followed soon thereafter by Smarr and by Eppley. These early attempts were focused on evolving Misner data in axisymmetry (also known as \"2+1 dimensions\"). At around the same time Tsvi Piran wrote the first code that evolved a system with gravitational radiation using a cylindrical symmetry. In this calculation Piran has set the foundation for many of the concepts used today in evolving ADM equations, like \"free evolution\" versus \"constrained evolution\", which deal with the fundamental problem of treating the constraint equations that arise in the ADM formalism. Applying symmetry reduced the computational and memory requirements associated with the problem, allowing the researchers to obtain results on the supercomputers available at the time.\n\nThe first realistic calculations of rotating collapse were carried out in the early eighties by Richard Stark and Tsvi Piran in which the gravitational wave forms resulting from formation of a rotating black hole were calculated for the first time. For nearly 20 years following the initial results, there were fairly few other published results in numerical relativity, probably due to the lack of sufficiently powerful computers to address the problem. In the late 1990s, the Binary Black Hole Grand Challenge Alliance successfully simulated a head-on binary black hole collision. As a post-processing step the group computed the event horizon for the spacetime. This result still required imposing and exploiting axisymmetry in the calculations.\n\nSome of the first documented attempts to solve the Einstein equations in three dimensions were focused on a single Schwarzschild black hole, which is described by a static and spherically symmetric solution to the Einstein field equations. This provides an excellent test case in numerical relativity because it does have a closed-form solution so that numerical results can be compared to an exact solution, because it is static, and because it contains one of the most numerically challenging features of relativity theory, a physical singularity. One of the earliest groups to attempt to simulate this solution was Anninos \"et al.\" in 1995. In their paper they point out that\n\nIn the years that followed, not only did computers become more powerful, but also various research groups developed alternate techniques to improve the efficiency of the calculations. With respect to black hole simulations specifically, two techniques were devised to avoid problems associated with the existence of physical singularities in the solutions to the equations: (1) Excision, and (2) the \"puncture\" method. In addition the Lazarus group developed techniques for using early results from a short-lived simulation solving the nonlinear ADM equations, in order to provide initial data for a more stable code based on linearized equations derived from perturbation theory. More generally, adaptive mesh refinement techniques, already used in computational fluid dynamics were introduced to the field of numerical relativity.\n\nIn the excision technique, which was first proposed in the late 1990s, a portion of a spacetime inside of the event horizon surrounding the singularity of a black hole is simply not evolved. In theory this should not affect the solution to the equations outside of the event horizon because of the principle of causality and properties of the event horizon (i.e. nothing physical inside the black hole can influence any of the physics outside the horizon). Thus if one simply does not solve the equations inside the horizon one should still be able to obtain valid solutions outside. One \"excises\" the interior by imposing ingoing boundary conditions on a boundary surrounding the singularity but inside the horizon.\nWhile the implementation of excision has been very successful, the technique has two minor problems. The first is that one has to be careful about the coordinate conditions. While physical effects cannot propagate from inside to outside, coordinate effects could. For example, if the coordinate conditions were elliptical, coordinate changes inside could instantly propagate out through the horizon. This then means that one needs hyperbolic type coordinate conditions with characteristic velocities less than that of light for the propagation of coordinate effects (e.g., using harmonic coordinates coordinate conditions). The second problem is that as the black holes move, one must continually adjust the location of the excision region to move with the black hole.\n\nThe excision technique was developed over several years including the development of new gauge conditions that increased stability and work that demonstrated the ability of the excision regions to move through the computational grid. The first stable, long-term evolution of the orbit and merger of two black holes using this technique was published in 2005.\n\nIn the puncture method the solution is factored into an analytical part, which contains the singularity of the black hole, and a numerically constructed part, which is then singularity free. This is a generalization of the Brill-Lindquist prescription for initial data of black holes at rest and can be generalized to the Bowen-York prescription for spinning and moving black hole initial data. Until 2005, all published usage of the puncture method required that the coordinate position of all punctures remain fixed during the course of the simulation. Of course black holes in proximity to each other will tend to move under the force of gravity, so the fact that the coordinate position of the puncture remained fixed meant that the coordinate systems themselves became \"stretched\" or \"twisted,\" and this typically led to numerical instabilities at some stage of the simulation.\nIn 2005 researchers demonstrated for the first time the ability to allow punctures to move through the coordinate system, thus eliminating some of the earlier problems with the method. This allowed accurate long-term evolutions of black holes. By choosing appropriate coordinate conditions and making crude analytic assumption about the fields near the singularity (since no physical effects can propagate out of the black hole, the crudeness of the approximations does not matter), numerical solutions could be obtained to the problem of two black holes orbiting each other, as well as accurate computation of gravitational radiation (ripples in spacetime) emitted by them.\n\nThe Lazarus project (1998–2005) was developed as a post-Grand Challenge technique to extract astrophysical results from short lived full numerical simulations of binary black holes. It combined approximation techniques before (post-Newtonian trajectories) and after (perturbations of single black holes) with full numerical simulations attempting to solve General Relativity field equations. All previous attempts to numerically integrate in supercomputers the Hilbert-Einstein equations describing the gravitational field around binary black holes led to software failure before a single orbit was completed.\n\nThe Lazarus approach, in the meantime, gave the best insight into the binary black hole problem and produced numerous and relatively accurate results, such as the radiated energy and angular momentum emitted in the latest merging state, the linear momentum radiated by unequal mass holes, and the final mass and spin of the remnant black hole. The method also computed detailed gravitational waves emitted by the merger process and predicted that the collision of black holes is the most energetic single event in the Universe, releasing more energy in a fraction of a second in the form of gravitational radiation than an entire galaxy in its lifetime.\n\nAdaptive mesh refinement (AMR) as a numerical method has roots that go well beyond its first application in the field of numerical relativity. Mesh refinement first appears in the numerical relativity literature in the 1980s, through the work of Choptuik in his studies of critical collapse of scalar fields. The original work was in one dimension, but it was subsequently extended to two dimensions. In two dimensions, AMR has also been applied to the study of inhomogeneous cosmologies, and to the study of Schwarzschild black holes. The technique has now become a standard tool in numerical relativity and has been used to study the merger of black holes and other compact objects in addition to the propagation of gravitational radiation generated by such astronomical events.\n\nIn the past few years, hundreds of research papers have been published leading to a wide spectrum of mathematical relativity, gravitational wave, and astrophysical results for the orbiting black hole problem. This technique extended to astrophysical binary systems involving neutron stars and black holes, and multiple black holes. One of the most surprising predictions is that the merger of two black holes can give the remnant hole a speed of up to 4000 km/s that can allow it to escape from any known galaxy. The simulations also predict an enormous release of gravitational energy in this merger process, amounting up to 8% of its total rest mass.\n\n\n"}

At a surgery, constituents may raise issues of concern in the same manner that a person may directly consult a General Practitioner in their surgery (a \"surgery\" being the term for the GP's workplace, an \"office\" in American parlance). The issues may relate to local issues (street crime, litter, a request for intervention by the representative on behalf of the constituent with local or national government) or to national policy matters.

Surgery meetings are usually confidential and differ from town hall meetings, which are open to many people at the same time.\n\nIt is up to each MP to decide whether they have any surgeries at all and if so, how many and in what locations. MPs often use local party offices, church halls or rooms in public houses as the venues, with a number of surgeries possibly being held at different locations around a constituency. Surgeries are traditionally held on Fridays or at weekends when MPs have returned from sittings of parliament in Westminster.

Their music often invoked religious imagery dealing with conflict, redemption, punishment, and guilt through David Eugene Edwards's lyrics and the heavy use of traditional bluegrass, gospel, and Appalachian instrumentation cross-bred with rock. For the bulk of its career, the band consisted of Edwards, Jean-Yves Tola, and Pascal Humbert, the latter two formerly of the French band Passion Fodder. After releasing four studio albums and touring extensively, the group broke up in 2005, citing \"mostly political and spiritual\" differences. The members remain active in the groups Woven Hand and Lilium.\n\nDavid Eugene Edwards and Pascal Humbert formed 16 Horsepower in 1992 in Los Angeles, California, where they had met building movie sets for Roger Corman's Hollywood Studios. Friend, co-worker and trained jazz drummer Jean-Yves Tola joined shortly after. The trio performed once as Horsepower before they parted ways with Humbert as Edwards and Tola relocated to Denver, Colorado.\n\nIn Edwards's hometown of Denver, the band once again became a trio with the addition of Keven Soll, a luthier and accomplished double bass player. Frustrated by misconceptions about the name Horsepower being related to heroin and inspired by a traditional American folk song about sixteen horses pulling the coffin of a beloved to the graveyard, the name was changed to 16 Horsepower. The band spent the following years rehearsing and gaining a reputation for their intense live performances while touring extensively across North America and eventually they released a seven-inch single, \"Shametown\", in 1994 on Ricochet Records. By this time they had gained the attention of A&M Records, and recording of \"Sackcloth 'n' Ashes\" began in 1995. For various reasons A&M decided to postpone the release of the album, and so the band returned to the studio and recorded their eponymous debut EP which was released the same year.\n\nThe debut full-length studio album \"Sackcloth 'n' Ashes\" was eventually released in 1996, garnering praise from the international music press. Pascal Humbert had relocated to Denver and joined the band as a second guitarist, although his primary instrument is the bass. Following differences about the musical direction, Soll was asked to leave and was replaced by Rob Redick, later known as the bassist for Candlebox. Redick did not last long because of what the band has referred to as \"kind of a mutual unhappiness\", and Humbert took over the bass duties. Jeffrey-Paul Norlander joined on second guitar shortly before recording began on the second album, \"Low Estate\", with John Parish as producer. Edwards and Norlander had previously been in several bands together, most notably The Denver Gentlemen.\n\nNorlander departed in 1998 and was replaced by Steve Taylor, the band's guitar technician, who had already been performing on a handful of songs on the bands European tour in 1996.\n\nSpending two years touring and writing new material, 16 Horsepower's third full-length album \"Secret South\" was not recorded and released until 2000. The album marked a distinct change in sound and tone from earlier releases as the up-tempo rock influences had all but vanished completely and left room for a more melodic folk-inspired sound. The band toured in Europe in 2000 with the new album, and rumours of a break-up began to circulate shortly after. This rumour was further fueled by the fact that the band members had begun to focus on solo and side-projects. Humbert had released his solo-debut with his project Lilium the previous year and Edwards had begun recording and performing live with his new project Woven Hand.\n\n16 Horsepower, short of Steve Taylor, returned in 2002 with \"Folklore\". As hinted by the title, this fourth studio album took the band further into traditional folk territory and featured only four original 16 Horsepower compositions. While the band went on several tours in support of the album, their creative output was focused on Woven Hand and Lilium, Tola having also joined the latter. \"Olden\", a compilation of previously unreleased versions of early material was released in 2003. This release was supported by a tour in early 2004, including their first US dates in three years, featuring a set split between early material and Folklore-era songs. In April 2005 the band announced their official break-up, as a result of personal, political and spiritual differences as well as finding the constant touring incompatible with their daily lives.\n\nAlternative Tentacles, a San Francisco-based record label run by former Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra absorbed American distribution of the band's latter records shortly before their breakup. Since the band's demise, the label has released two DVD-format retrospectives, and in 2008 released a two-CD set \"Live March 2001\". Humbert joined Woven Hand in 2007.\n\nIt has always been difficult to describe the band's music in simple terms as it borrowed just as heavily from folk music, country, bluegrass, and traditional as it did from rock music. 16 Horsepower and Edwards' later project Woven Hand were described by one critic as \"incendiary gospel, hallowed folk and mordant tones infused with a high, dark theatricality worthy of Nick Cave.\"\n\nEdwards' grandfather was a Nazarene preacher and young Edwards often went along as his elder preached the gospel to various peoples. This experience colored his approach to songwriting as well as the instrumentation employed to develop the band's unique sound. On several tracks over the course of the band's career, Edwards evoked decisive Christian imagery, particularly that of the redemptive capacity of Jesus Christ.\n\n16 Horsepower, especially in their early days, saw themselves first and foremost as a rock band. David Eugene Edwards, however, had an interest in all things from past times, including musical instruments. One instrument that was paramount during the nascent days of 16 Horsepower was the Chemnitzer concertina. It was erroneously credited as a bandoneon (a closely related instrument) on \"Sackcloth 'n' Ashes\". The antique instrument used on the early tours and recordings was falling apart and quite cumbersome to tour with; some time before the sessions for \"Low Estate\", it was replaced with the more modern American-made Patek brand instrument.\n\nAcknowledged influences on the band included Joy Division, the Gun Club, Nick Cave and the Birthday Party. 16 Horsepower would eventually share the same management as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and tour with them. They also collaborated with Bertrand Cantat from French band Noir Désir on a cover of The Gun Club's \"Fire Spirit\" for the 1998 EP \"The Partisan\" and on \"The Partisan\" itself.\n\n16 Horsepower are among the Denver-based bands credited for laying the foundation for what today has become known as \"Gothic Americana\". American metal band DevilDriver paid homage to 16 Horsepower with a cover of \"Black Soul Choir\" on their 2011 release, \"Beast\". A post-rock interpretation of \"Black Soul Choir\" sung by Brandy Bones became a live staple of Canadian band Big John Bates during their 2012 Battered Bones tour.\n\nTheir 2000 cover of \"Wayfaring Stranger\" was featured at the end of Bart Layton's 2012 documentary \"The Imposter\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dean Taylor (born Richard Dean Taylor, 11 May 1939) is a Canadian singer, most notable as a recording artist, songwriter, and record producer for Motown during the 1960s and 1970s. According to Jason Ankeny, Taylor \"remains one of the most underrated acts ever to record under the Motown aegis.\"\n\nAs a singer, American audiences know Taylor best for his chart-topping 1970 hit \"Indiana Wants Me\", which hit No. 1 in \"Cash Box\" in the United States and was also No. 1 in Canada and No. 2 in the UK. It peaked at No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song was featured in the opening minutes of the 1980 American movie, \"The Ninth Configuration\". He is well known in the United Kingdom for other hits, including \"Gotta See Jane\" and \"There's a Ghost in My House\".\n\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Taylor began his career in 1961, as a pianist and singer with several music bands in Toronto. He also made his first recordings in 1961, for the Audiomaster record label. The next year, Taylor's \"At The High School Dance\", a single for Amy-Mala Records, was a minor success. His next single, \"I'll Remember\", on the Barry label, was a No. 23 success for Toronto rock and roll radio station CHUM, and the singer decided to relocate to Detroit, Michigan, to further his career.\n\nIn Detroit, Taylor was hired by Motown Records in 1964 as a songwriter and recording artist for the Motown subsidiary V.I.P. label. Taylor's scheduled first single (March 1964) for V.I.P. was the topical satire \"My Ladybug (Stay Away From That Beatle)\", but it was deemed too weak for release and was never issued.\n\nIt was not until November 1965 that Taylor's debut V.I.P. single, \"Let's Go Somewhere\", was issued. It was written by Taylor in conjunction with Brian Holland, and produced by the team of Holland and Lamont Dozier, who had already produced five No. 1 scoring songs for The Supremes. However, the song was only a regional success in several U.S. cities and Toronto.\n\nTaylor's next single (1967's \"There's A Ghost In My House\") was written by the team of Holland–Dozier–Holland along with Taylor, and again produced by Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier. It was also a commercial disappointment in the US — but it was a No. 3 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1974. Taylor was also beginning to become a songwriter for other acts, as \"I'll Turn to Stone\" by the Four Tops, and \"All I Need\" by The Temptations were both charting US singles in 1967, co-composed by him.\n\nIn 1968, Taylor's self-produced single \"Gotta See Jane\", (co-written with Brian Holland), became a Top 20 hit in the UK. However, his real success came as a member of the Motown writing and production team known as \"The Clan\". This production group was briefly the prime creator of material for Diana Ross & the Supremes after the Holland / Dozier / Holland team left Motown. Among Taylor's successful co-compositions and co-productions during 1968 and 1969 as a member of The Clan were Diana Ross & the Supremes' No. 1 US hit \"Love Child\" and their Top 10 follow-up hit \"I'm Livin' In Shame\".\n\nTaylor resumed his recording career in 1970, becoming one of the first artists assigned to Motown's new subsidiary Rare Earth, which was dedicated to white artists. In that year his first Rare Earth single, \"Indiana Wants Me\", became a No. 1 hit in his native Canada and in Cash Box magazine in the US. It peaked at No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, and at No. 2 in the UK. \"Gotta See Jane\" was also reissued in 1971, and became a Top 10 success in Canada. His 1972 single \"Taos New Mexico\" did not do well on the Canadian charts, reaching number 48.\n\nTaylor continued recording for Rare Earth, and working as a writer / producer for other artists until Rare Earth was ended in 1976. Though he never again scored the charts as he had done with \"Indiana Wants Me\", his releases did moderately well, especially in Canada. As a Canadian citizen, he could be played on CKLW and other Canadian radio stations and counted towards the stations' Canadian content quotas.\n\nTaylor attempted a comeback during the early 1980s, after which he had a hiatus from the music industry. He also established his own record company, Jane Records, in 1973.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are best known for their 1965 \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number-one single \"This Diamond Ring\", which was the first of a string of hit singles they had in 1965 and 1966. The band had an earnest, boy-next-door image similar to British invasion contemporaries such as Herman's Hermits and Gerry and the Pacemakers. The group folded in 1970, but a version of the band later resumed touring and continues to tour, often playing for veterans' benefits.\n\nThe group began life as Gary & the Playboys. Gary Lewis started the band with four friends of his when he was 18. Joking at the lateness of his bandmates to practice, Lewis referred to them as \"playboys\", and the name stuck.\n\nThey auditioned for a job at Disneyland without telling Disneyland employees about Lewis' celebrity father. They were hired on the spot, audiences at Disneyland quickly accepted them, and the Playboys were soon playing to a full house every night.\n\nThe orchestra bandleader Les Brown, who had known Jerry Lewis for years, had told record producer Snuff Garrett that the younger Lewis was playing at Disneyland. After listening to the band, Garrett thought using Gary's famous name might sell more records, and convinced them to add \"Lewis\" into their name. \n\nGarrett brought them to a recording studio with the song \"This Diamond Ring\" in a session financed by Jerry Lewis' wife Patti. It has been reported that The Playboys were not allowed to play their own instruments in the studio, but Lewis has since denied this. Garrett wanted to maximize the chances for a hit, so he insisted on using experienced session musicians for the overdubs, which included guitar and keyboard solos, additional bass and drum overdubs, and timpani. \n\nThese musicians included Mike Deasy and Tommy Allsup on guitars, Leon Russell on keyboards, Joe Osborn on bass, and Hal Blaine on drums, members of the larger group known as The Wrecking Crew. Session singer Ron Hicklin did the basic vocal track. Garrett then added Lewis's voice twice, added some of the Playboys and more of Hicklin. \"When I got through, he sounded like Mario Lanza\", Garrett commented.\n\nGarrett got airplay in New York City for \"This Diamond Ring\" by making a deal with WINS disc jockey \"Murray the K\" Kaufman, who ran a series of all-star concerts at theaters around the New York area. Garrett promised that if Kaufman played Lewis’ record, the Playboys would do his shows. Garrett then had Jerry Lewis use his contacts to get his son onto \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". \n\nHowever, Sullivan had a general policy that all acts appearing on his show were to perform live. Since so many studio tricks had been used on the record, the Playboys could not recreate its sound. In compromise, Lewis sang along with pre-recorded tracks as the Playboys pretended to play their instruments.\n\nThe January 1965 broadcast made Gary Lewis and the Playboys instant stars. \"This Diamond Ring\" went to No. 1, sold over 1 million copies by April 1965, and became a gold disc. However, by the end of 1965 only West and Lewis remained in the band. Other later band members included Tommy Tripplehorn, father of actress Jeanne Tripplehorn; Carl Radle (died 1980); Jimmy Karstein; Randy Ruff' Pete Vrains; Bob Simpson; Adolph Zeugner; Les John; Wayne Bruno; and Dave Gonzalez.\n\nThe group was one of only two acts during the 1960s whose first seven releases on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 reached that chart's top 10 (The Lovin' Spoonful was the other). The singles were \"This Diamond Ring\" (No. 1), \"Count Me In\" (the only non-British Commonwealth record in the Hot 100's Top 10 on May 8, 1965, at No. 2), \"Save Your Heart for Me\" (No. 2), \"Everybody Loves a Clown\" (No. 4), \"She's Just My Style\" (No. 3), \"Sure Gonna Miss Her\" (No. 9), and \"Green Grass\" (No. 8). Lewis was drafted into the U.S. Army in January 1967, with previously made recordings continuing to reach the Hot 100, but with decreasing success. \n\nOn his 1968 discharge, Lewis immediately returned to recording, reaching the top 40 one last time with a top 20 remake of Brian Hyland's \"Sealed With A Kiss\", but unable to regain his group's earlier momentum. Lewis continued touring, eventually marketing the band as a nostalgia act. He also appeared and performed on many of his father's Labor Day telethons for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.\n\nIn all, Lewis had eight gold singles, 12 Top 40 hit singles (but only 15 Hot 100 entries (U.S.)), and four gold albums. In addition to \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", he appeared on \"American Bandstand\", \"Shindig!\", \"Hullabaloo\", \"The Sally Jessy Raphaël show\", \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", \"The Mike Douglas Show\", \"Nashville Now\" and \"Wolfman Jack\".\n\nDespite the group's U.S. success, they made virtually no impact at all in the U.K.; their only UK Singles Chart appearance occurred in 1975, when a reissue of 1966's \"My Heart's Symphony\" peaked at No. 36. Nevertheless, at a time when British groups were dominating the American music scene, Gary Lewis & the Playboys were one of the few successful 1960s homegrown groups.\n\n\n"}

Burns\n\nArthur Frank Burns (August 27, 1904June 26, 1987) was an American economist. His career alternated between academia and government. From 1927 to the 1970s, Burns taught and researched at Rutgers University, Columbia University, and the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nBurns was the chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisors from 1953 to 1956 under Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidency. In 1969, he originated the post of Counselor to the President, under Richard Nixon. He served as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1970 to 1978 and as Ambassador to West Germany from 1981 to 1985.\n\nBurns was born in Stanislau (now Ivano-Frankivsk), Austrian Poland (Galicia), a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in 1904 to Polish-Jewish parents, Sarah Juran and Nathan Burnseig, who worked as a house painter. He showed aptitude early in his childhood, when he translated the Talmud into Polish and Russian by age six and debated socialism at age nine. In 1914, he immigrated to Bayonne, New Jersey, with his parents. He graduated from Bayonne High School.\n\nAt age 17, Burns enrolled in Columbia University on a scholarship offered by the university secretary. He worked in jobs ranging from postal clerk to shoe salesman during his time at Columbia as a student before earning his B.A. and M.A. in 1925, graduating Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nAfter college, he began teaching economics at Rutgers University in 1927, a role that he continued until 1944. Burns through his lectures became one of two professors, the other being Homer Jones, credited by Milton Friedman as a key influence for his decision to become an economist. Burns had convinced Friedman, Rutgers class of 1932, that modern economics could help end the Great Depression.\n\nIn 1930, he married Helen Bernstein, a teacher.\n\nBurns pursued graduate studies at Columbia while continuing his lectures at Rutgers. As a doctoral student, he became a protege of Wesley Clair Mitchell, a founder and the chief economics researcher of the National Bureau of Economic Research. In 1933, Burns joined the NBER under Mitchell's guidance and began a lifelong study of business cycles. He received his Ph.D. in economics from Columbia a year later.\n\nIn 1943 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.\nIn 1944, he left Rutgers and assumed the role of director of research at the NBER in 1945 following Mitchell's retirement.\n\nIn 1945, Burns became a professor at Columbia University. In 1959, he received the John Bates Clark endowed chair. At Columbia, he blocked the acceptance of Murray Rothbard's thesis on the Panic of 1819, despite having known Rothbard since the latter was a child.\n\nBeginning in 1933, the academic part of Burns's career focused on the measurement of business cycles, including questions such as the duration of economic expansions, and what economic variables rise during expansions and fall during recessions. In 1934, Burns wrote \"Production Trends in the United States Since 1870\" his first major publication in the field.\n\nOften, he collaborated with Wesley Clair Mitchell, whose research directorate role he assumed from 1945 to 1953. In 1946, Burns and Mitchell published \"Measuring Business Cycles\", which presented the characteristic NBER methods of analyzing business cycles. During his tenure, Burns began the academic tradition of determining recessions, a role continued by the NBER's business cycle dating committee. Today, the NBER is still considered authoritative in dating recessions.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Burns asked Milton Friedman, then a professor at the University of Chicago, to join the NBER as a researcher of the role of money in the business cycle. Burns's detailed macroeconomic analysis influenced Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz's classic work \"A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960\".\n\nBurns was appointed as Counselor to the President when Richard Nixon took office in 1969. The newly created position held cabinet rank and was meant as a placeholder until Burns could be appointed as Chair of the Federal Reserve. Burns advised Nixon on economic policy during his brief time in the White House.\n\nAs expected, Burns was appointed to replace the outgoing William McChesney Martin as Fed Chair in November 1969 and resigned his post in the Nixon administration.\n\nBurns served as Fed Chairman from February 1970 until the end of January 1978. He has a reputation of having been overly influenced by political pressure in his monetary policy decisions during his time as Chairman and for supporting the policy, widely accepted in political and economic circles at the time, that Fed action should try to maintain an unemployment rate of around 4 percent. (\"See also: Phillips curve\")\n\nWhen Vice President Richard M. Nixon was running for President in 1959–1960, the Fed, under the Truman-appointed William McChesney Martin, Jr., was undertaking a monetary tightening policy that resulted in a recession in April 1960. In his book \"Six Crises\", Nixon later blamed his defeat in 1960 in part on Fed policy and the resulting tight credit conditions and slow growth. After finally winning the presidential election of 1968, Nixon named Burns to the Fed Chairmanship in 1970 with instructions to ensure easy access to credit when Nixon was running for reelection in 1972.\n\nLater, when Burns resisted, negative press about him was planted in newspapers and, under the threat of legislation to dilute the Fed's influence, Burns and other Governors succumbed. Burns' relationship with Nixon was often rocky. Reflecting in his diary about a 1971 meeting attended by himself, Nixon, Treasury Secretary John Connally, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, Burns wrote:\n\nThere was significant inflation during this period, which Nixon attempted to manage through wage and price controls while the Fed under Burns maintained an expansive monetary policy. Although Burns opposed Nixon's decision to close the \"gold window,\" he \"'assured the President that I would support his new program fully,' notwithstanding his reservations about the gold suspension.\" After the 1972 election, due in part to oil shocks from the 1973 oil crisis, price controls began to fail and by 1974, the inflation rate was 12.3 percent.\n\nBurns thought the country was not willing to accept rates of unemployment in the range of six percent as a means of quelling inflation. From the Board of Governors meeting minutes of November 1970, Burns believed that:\n\nDuring Burns' tenure, the rate of change of the consumer price index rose from 6%/year in early 1970 to over 12%/year in late 1974 after the Arab Oil embargo, and eventually falling to under 7%/year from 1976 to the end of his tenure in January, 1978, with an annual average rate of consumer price inflation of approximately 9% during his term. Negative economic events included multiple oil shocks (1973 and 1979) and heavy government deficits arising in part from the Vietnam War and Great Society government programs.\n\nAt the Watergate break-in of 1972, the burglars were found carrying $6300 of sequentially numbered $100 bills. The Fed lied to reporter Bob Woodward as to the source of the bills. Burns stonewalled Congressional investigations about them and issued a directive to all Fed offices prohibiting any discussion of the subject.\n\nIn 1976, Burns received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.\n\nWilliam Baroody, then president of the American Enterprise Institute, brought Burns to the economics think tank in 1978 after Burns left his position at the Federal Reserve. From the AEI, Burns continued to influence public policy.\n\nArthur Burns was appointed United States Ambassador to West Germany by President Ronald Reagan. He served in Bonn from June 1981 to May 1985.\n\nHe died on June 26, 1987 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nConservative economist Bruce Bartlett gives Burns poor marks for his tenure as Fed chairman because the inflationary forces that began in 1970 took more than a decade to resolve.\nIn more recent years, the famous quote, \"The ultimate purpose of an economy is to produce more consumer goods,\" has erroneously been attributed to Burns in popular culture. However, there is absolutely no evidence that Burns ever uttered this statement; to the contrary, he advocated–both in his speeches and his policies–for thrift and fiscal responsibility .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1797746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797746", "title": "Mural crown", "text": "Mural crown\n\nA mural crown () is a crown or headpiece representing city walls or towers. In classical antiquity, it was an emblem of tutelary deities who watched over a city, and among the Romans a military decoration. Later the mural crown developed into a symbol of European heraldry, mostly for cities and towns, and in the 19th and 20th centuries was used in some republican heraldry. \n\nIn Hellenistic culture, a mural crown identified tutelary deities such as the goddess Tyche (the embodiment of the fortune of a city, familiar to Romans as Fortuna), and Hestia (the embodiment of the protection of a city, familiar to Romans as Vesta). The high cylindrical \"polos\" of Cybele too could be rendered as a mural crown in Hellenistic times, specifically designating the mother goddess as patron of a city.\nThe mural crown became an ancient Roman military decoration. The \"corona muralis\" (Latin for \"walled crown\") was a golden crown, or a circle of gold intended to resemble a battlement, bestowed upon the soldier who first climbed the wall of a besieged city or fortress to successfully place the standard of the attacking army upon it. The Roman mural crown was made of gold, and decorated with turrets, as is the heraldic version. As it was among the highest order of military decorations, it was not awarded to a claimant until after a strict investigation. The \"rostrata\" mural crown, composed of the \"rostra\" indicative of captured ships, was assigned as naval prize to the first in a boarding party, similar to the naval crown.\n\nThe Graeco-Roman goddess Roma's attributes on Greek coinage usually include her mural crown, signifying Rome's status as a loyal protector of Hellenic city-states.\n\nThe Roman military decoration was subsequently employed in European heraldry, where the term denoted a crown modeled after the walls of a castle, which may be tinctured \"or\" (gold), \"argent\" (silver), \"gules\" (red), or \"proper\" (i.e. stone-coloured). In 19th-century Germany, mural crowns (') came to be adopted for the arms of cities, with increasingly specific details: \"Residential (i.e. having a \"royal\" residence) cities and capital towns usually bear a ' with five towers, large towns one with four towers, smaller towns one with three\", observed Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, in \"A Complete Guide to Heraldry\", adding \"Strict regulations in the matter do not yet exist\" and warning that the usage was not British.\n\nIn recent times, mural crowns were used, rather than royal crowns, for medieval and modern Italian . A mural-crowned lady, Italia Turrita, personifies Italy. In Italy, and some provinces and military corps have mural crowns on their coats of arms: gold with five towers for cities, and silver with nine-towered for others. The coat of arms of the Second Spanish Republic had a mural crown.\n\nIn the early 20th century Portugal established strict rules for its municipal heraldry, in which each coat of arms contains a mural crown, with three silver towers signifying a village or an urban parish, four silver towers representing a town, five silver towers standing for a city and five gold towers for a capital city. The Portuguese rules are also applied to most municipal coats of arms of Brazil and some other members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.\n\nRomanian municipal coats of arms contain a mural crown, with one or three towers for villages and communes, five and seven towers for towns and municipalities.\n\nThe eagle on the coat of arms of Austria wears a mural crown to signify its status as a republic. This is in contrast to the royal crowns that adorned the double-headed eagle (and the imperial crown positioned above it) in the coat of arms of Austria-Hungary until their defeat in World War I. The mural-crowned eagle was abandoned under the clerico-fascist Federal State of Austria from 1934, but was reinstated in Allied-occupied Austria following World War II and remains in place to this day.\n"}
{"id": "1797747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797747", "title": "Euro sign", "text": "Euro sign\n\nThe euro sign, , is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the Eurozone and some other countries (such as Kosovo and Montenegro). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. It consists of a stylized letter E (or epsilon), crossed by two lines instead of one. In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €); in most other European languages, the reverse is true.\n\nThere were originally 32 proposed designs for a symbol for Europe's new common currency; the European Commission short-listed these to ten candidates. These ten were put to a public survey. After the survey had narrowed the original ten proposals down to two, it was up to the Commission to choose the final design. The other designs that were considered are not available for the public to view, nor is any information regarding the designers available for public query. The European Commission considers the process of designing to have been internal and keeps these records secret. The eventual winner was a design created by a team of four experts whose identities have not been revealed. It is assumed that the Belgian graphic designer Alain Billiet was the winner and thus the designer of the euro sign.\n\nThe official story of the design history of the euro sign is disputed by Arthur Eisenmenger, a former chief graphic designer for the European Economic Community, who claims he had the idea prior to the European Commission.\n\nThe European Commission specified a euro logo with exact proportions and colours (PMS Yellow foreground, PMS Reflex Blue background), for use in public-relations material related to the euro introduction. While the Commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape, type designers made it clear that they intended instead to adapt the design to be consistent with the typefaces to which it was to be added.\n\nGenerating the euro sign using a computer depends on the operating system and national conventions. Initially, some mobile phone companies issued an interim software update for their special SMS character set, replacing the less-frequent Japanese yen sign with the euro sign. Subsequent mobile phones have both currency signs.\n\nThe euro is represented in the Unicode character set with the character name EURO SIGN and the code position U+20AC (decimal 8364) as well as in updated versions of the traditional Latin character set encodings. In HTML, the &euro; entity can also be used.\n\nAn implicit character encoding, along with the fact that the code position of the euro sign is different in historic encoding schemes (code pages), led to many initial problems displaying the euro sign consistently in computer applications, depending on access method. While displaying the euro sign was no problem as long as only one system was used (provided an up-to-date font with the proper glyph was available), mixed setups often produced errors. Initially, Apple, Microsoft and Unix systems each chose a different code point to represent a euro symbol: thus a user of one system might have seen a euro symbol whereas another would see a different symbol or nothing at all. Another was legacy software which could only handle older encodings such as ISO 8859-1 that contained no euro sign at all. In such situations, character set conversions had to be made, often introducing conversion errors such as a question mark (?) being displayed instead of a euro sign. Widespread adoption of Unicode and UTF-8 encoding means that these issues rarely arise in modern computing.\n\nDepending on keyboard layout and the operating system, the symbol can be entered as:\n\n\nOn the macOS operating system, a variety of key combinations are used depending on the keyboard layout, for example:\n\nThe Compose key sequence for the euro sign is followed by .\n\nClassical typewriters are still used in many parts of the world, often recycled from businesses that have adopted desktop computers. Typewriters lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital \"C\", backspacing, and overstriking it with the equal (\"=\") sign.\n\nPlacement of the sign also varies. Countries have generally continued the style used for their former currencies. In those countries where previous convention was to place the currency sign before the figure, the euro sign is placed in the same position (e.g.,€3.50). In those countries where the an amount preceded the national currency sign, the euro sign is again placed in that relative position (e.g., 3,50 €).\n\nThe European Commission includes a guideline in its institutional style guide (for its own staff) on the use of the euro sign, stating it should be placed in front of the amount without any space in English, but after the amount in most other languages.\n\nIn English language newspapers and periodicals, the euro sign—like the dollar sign ($) and the pound sign (£)—is placed before the figure, unspaced, as used by publications such as the \"Financial Times\" and \"The Economist\". When written out, \"euro\" is placed after the value in lower case; the plural is used for two or more units, and (in English) euro cents are separated with a point, not a comma (e.g., \"1.50 euro\", \"14 euros\").\n\nPrices of items costing less than one euro (for example ten cents) are often written using a local abbreviation like \"ct.\" (particularly in Germany, Spain, and Lithuania), \"snt.\" (Finland), c.

Bersani was Minister of Industry, Commerce and Craftmanship from 1996 to 1999, Minister of Transport from 1999 to 2001, and Minister of Economic Development from 2006 to 2008.\n\nPier Luigi Bersani was born on 29 September 1951, in Bettola, a mountain municipality in Nure Valley, in the province of Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna region, Italy. His father was a mechanic and a gas station clerk. After earning his high-school degree in Piacenza, Bersani enrolled in the University of Bologna where he graduated in philosophy with a dissertation on Pope Gregory I. He married Daniela in 1980, and he has two daughters: Elisa and Margherita. After a short experience as a teacher he committed his life to politics and public administration.\n\nBersani joined the Italian Communist Party and subsequently the Democratic Party of the Left. As member of the National Secretariat of the Democrats of the Left, he was responsible for the economic sector. As a young man, he became Vice-President of the Mountain Community of Piacenza, then elected in the Regional Council of Emilia-Romagna region and Vice-President of Emilia-Romagna in 1990; he was President of Emilia-Romagna from 1993 to 1996.\n\nAfter the general election of 1996 he was Minister of Industry, Commerce and Craftmanship (1996–1999) and Minister of Transports (1999–2001) in the center-left cabinets of Prodi, D'Alema, Amato.\n\nIn 2004, he was elected to the European Parliament representing the North-West region for the Democrats of the Left, part of the Socialist Group, and sat on the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. He was a substitute for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, a member of the Delegation to the European Union-Kazakhstan, EU-Kyrgyzstan and EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and for relations with Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Mongolia, and a substitute for the Delegation for relations with Belarus. He left the European Parliament on his re-election to the Chamber of Deputies in 2006, and he was appointed as Minister of Economic Development in the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi on 17 May 2006.\n\nThe Prodi II Cabinet assigned the Minister of Economic Development, Pier Luigi Bersani, the task of introducing reforms aimed at achieving increased market liberalization and competition. The minister responded with Decree Law 223 of 30 June 2006, later converted into Law 248/2006, popularly known as the “Bersani 1” decree on taxi drivers and pharmacies, although it addressed other sectors as well.\n\nThe government’s policy of competition and liberalization would not to stop there. “Bersani 1” was followed by “Bersani 2” (decree 7 of 31 January 2007, converted into Law 40 of 2 April 2007), and then by a series of bills for the liberalization of the professions and television broadcasting, local public services, and energy, as well as the reduction and simplification of times and procedures for the start up of new businesses. Another bill proposed to rationalize the jurisdictions of the regulatory authorities, modifying and reinforcing their powers, particularly with regard to competition. Still another bill would introduce and regulate the judicial procedures for class action lawsuits.\n\nOn 25 October 2009, Bersani defeated incumbents Dario Franceschini and Ignazio Marino in the Democratic Party leadership election, thus becoming Italy's main opposition leader, scoring 55.1% among party members. Since 7 November 2009, as decided by the National Assembly, Pier Luigi Bersani officially took office as Secretary of the Democratic Party of Italy. He defeated the mayor of Florence Matteo Renzi in the 2012 primary election.\n\nBefore the 2013 Italian general election, the Democratic Party was ahead but at \"the beginning of the year, Bersani’s party was above 40%, and former center-right Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was hovering around 25%. By the time [reported] polling stopped [a week before the vote], the right was up to 30% and the left down to 35%. Outgoing appointed-technocrat Prime Minister Mario Monti’s centrist party-coalition was at less than 15% of the vote and the protest Five-Star Movement led by comedian Beppe Grillo was getting more than 15%\".\n\nIn the general elections on 24–25 February 2013, as a consequence of the electoral system the DP-led centre-left coalition took a small absolute majority in the lower house. In most of the rest of Europe, this would have been enough to make Bersani Prime Minister. However, the coalition failed to gain a majority in the Senate. Italian governments must maintain the confidence of both chambers in order to stay in office. Bersani said he would try to form a government with the informal support of Five Star Movement. Anna Finocchiaro, DP's leader in the Senate, confirmed the likelihood DP would not form a new coalition with Berlusconi's Centre-right coalition.\n\nOn 22 March President Giorgio Napolitano asked Bersani to form a new government. On 27 March Bersani failed to strike a deal for forming a new Italian government with the grassroots Five-Star Movement (M5S) which held the balance of power after February's inconclusive elections. On 19 April Bersani announced he would be stepping down from his post as Democratic Party leader after Romano Prodi failed to secure a parliamentary majority in the presidential election.\n\nIn 2001, Bersani co-founded with Vincenzo Visco the \"NENS\" (\"New Economy, New Society\") think tank. He is also chairman of the \"Nuova Romea\" Society that was established in 2002 with the objective of the development of Emilia-Romagna and Veneto territories.\n\n\n"}

In 1835, he ran away from his indenture, stowing away on a ship bound for Mobile, Alabama. Upon discovery, he was adopted into the crew and trained in navigation, becoming a steamboat pilot by the age of sixteen. While serving in the end and Georgia.\n\nDuring the Texas revolution, King's friend and subsequent ranching and steam boating partner, Mifflin Kenedy, enlisted as ship master. Having run men and supplies to the United States Army along the Rio Grande. Kenedy convinced King in 1846 to join the war effort along the Rio Grande, where King worked on the transport \"Colonel Cross\", ferrying army supplies between Reynosa, Camargo, and Matamoros. In 1850, following the war, King, Kenedy and two other partners formed the M. Kenedy and Company steamboat firm, renamed in 1866 to King, Kenedy and Company when the two other partners were bought out. This firm achieved \"nearly monopolistic\" control on the Rio Grande for most of the years between 1850 and 1874, when the partnership was dissolved.\n\nIn addition to selling cattle to the Confederacy for food, King was active in the Cotton Road trade route during the Civil War which sold Confederate cotton through Mexico. King profited from both cotton road caravans stopping in King Ranch for supplies, and from steamboats operating under Mexican registry transporting cotton to Mexico and returning to Texas with military supplies.\n\nWhen the Union army invaded Texas to stop the Cotton Road trade, King participated in shifting the Cotton Road to Laredo. After the Battle of Brownsville, King Ranch was attacked by Union troops Christmastime 1863 by 80 men led by Captain James Speed. King was warned and fled the ranch house, leaving his family under the care of ranch hand Francisco Alvarado. When troops fired on the house, Alvarado was killed attempting to warn the soldiers that there were women and children inside. The troops searched the property for King, vandalized the house and took the ranch hands as prisoners.\n\nKing continued to work the cotton trade throughout the war, and stayed in Matamoros, Mexico waiting to see if his request for amnesty from the President was approved. He acquired letters of amnesty and returned to Texas July 14th, 1865.\n\nAs soon as King had arrived in Texas, he began speculating in land, beginning with lots in Brownsville, Texas and Cameron County, Texas, and continued investing the large profits from the riverboat firm. In 1852, King purchased a false title to the southern half of Padre Island. That same year, he traveled overland from Brownsville to Corpus Christi, and became fascinated with the grasslands along Santa Gertrudis Creek in the \"Nueces Strip\" (the land between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande). In 1853 and 1854 King began land acquisitions in the region of the creek, purchasing valid titles to two ranches of a combined , forming the nucleus of the King Ranch. He continued acquiring land until his death in 1885, when the ranch had .\n\nIn 1885, in obvious poor health, King traveled to San Antonio to see his doctor. He died of stomach cancer on April 14, at the Menger Hotel.\n\nThe King Ranch continues to be a dominant economic force in the region. The town of Kingsville, Texas is named for King. Corpus Christi has a high school named for King. In 1959, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.\n\n"}

Working at the Ministry of External Relations, he was Head of the Department of African Affairs, Director for Asia and Africa, Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, and Ambassador to Morocco, Greece and UNESCO. He was Cameroon's Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983 and its Ambassador to France from 1983 until he was named Minister of External Relations on May 16, 1988. He also wrote a book, published in Paris in 1982, called \"The Decolonization of Namibia: a Usurped Mandate\".\n\nBooh-Booh's role in Rwanda has been the subject of harsh criticism, primarily by Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire and his supporters, contending that he played an instrumental role in forestalling any UN military preventive action against the Rwandan genocide that appeared imminent in the country in mid-1994. For his part, in his 2005 book \"Le Patron de Dallaire Parle\" (Dallaire's Boss Speaks) Booh-Booh strongly criticized the account and actions of Dallaire, who was the commander of the UNAMIR forces on the ground in 1994.\n\nIn 1993, Booh-Booh was head of mission of a small force of UNAMIR military personnel (approximately 2,548) that was dispatched by the United Nations to Rwanda, in an effort to aid in the implementation of the Arusha Accords and to keep the peace between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. According to Dallaire's autobiography, \"Shake Hands With the Devil\", Dallaire had been given warnings from a reliable government source of an impending extermination campaign by Hutu extremists against the country's Tutsi minority and moderate Hutus. He passed this information along to the UN's headquarters in New York and reported his intent to inspect alleged arms caches. He was ordered not to intervene, and his later requests to increase the UNAMIR force by 5,000 peace-keeping soldiers were also denied.\n\nShortly before President Juvénal Habyarimana's assassination, Booh-Booh was also criticized for spending Easter weekend 1994 with Habyarimana, raising questions about the SRSG's impartiality. While Booh-Booh claimed this was purely for fact-finding purposes, the Rwandese Patriotic Front filed a formal complaint regarding Booh-Booh's neutrality. This further worsened the RPF's confidence in UNAMIR.\n\nThe United Nations, restrained by the political interests of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and reluctance of the international community, remained passive before and throughout the predicted genocide of some 800,000 (some sources estimate one million) people that took place from April to July 1994, finally ending around the time the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front took the nation's capital, Kigali, on July 18, 1994. As the genocide was occurring, the UNAMIR peace-keeping force was reduced from over 2,500 to a mere 270 soldiers. \nBooh-Booh was replaced as Special Representative on 1 July 1994 by Shahryar Khan of Pakistan.\n\n\n"}

He succeeded the longtime governor, Max Wellborn, who was also his daughter's father-in-law. When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 happened, he and two cashiers rushed to Nashville, Tennessee to supply currency and credit to banks in the city and surrounding region. The situation worsened with other cities in the region experiencing bank runs. Black kept his district afloat by rushing large quantities of cash to banks that were experiencing runs and extending credit to any bank that could offer any asset of value. He kept this policy active through the Great Depression into 1933. He, along with George L.

Francis Willoughby was second son of William Willoughby, 3rd Lord Willoughby of Parham The young and unexpected death of his elder brother Henry made Francis successor to the hereditary peerage and seat in the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament. Francis Willoughby was an early supporter of the Parliamentarian cause during the English Civil War but later became a Royalist. He twice served as governor of English colonies in the Caribbean. Francis Willoughby died without male heirs of his body and the title passed to his younger brother William Willoughby, 6th Lord Willoughby of Parham, the third son of William Willoughby, 3rd Lord Willoughby of Parham.\n\nFrancis Willoughby was born in perhaps late 1613 (since he was baptised in 1614) to William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham and Frances Manners, daughter of John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland of Nottingham at Parham in Suffolk. His father died in 1617, and the barony was held by his older brother Henry for one year until he too died barely five years old, at which point Francis inherited the seat in the House of Lords and with it the family title.\n\nOn 16 November 1628 Willoughby married Elizabeth Cecil (1606–1661), the daughter of the soldier Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon and Theodosia Noel.\n\nAs tensions between the king and Parliament grew in the 1630s, he found himself opposed to Charles I over the levying of ship money. His loyalty was further strained by the Bishops' Wars, in which he was reluctant to fight the Scots.\n\nWhen the king in 1642 issued his Commission of Array to form a loyal army, Willoughby rejected his summons and instead took command of a horse regiment under the Parliamentary commander, the Earl of Essex. By January 1643 he was made commander-in-chief of Lincolnshire.\n\nOn 16 July of the same year, he led his soldiers in a surprise attack on Gainsborough where he seized the town. Facing a counterattack, Willoughby's soldiers fought along with those under Oliver Cromwell to hold off an advancing Royalist force of superior strength. The main body of the Parliamentary army withdrew to Boston with only two dead.\n\nThat September, Willoughby was a subordinate commander under the Earl of Manchester and Cromwell. He fought at the Battle of Winceby and accepted the surrender of Bolingbroke Castle in November.\n\nWilloughby's relations with the Parliamentarians began to fray in 1644. In March he joined with Sir John Meldrum in the assault on Newark, the failure of which has been partially attributed to Willoughby's supposed unwillingness to take orders from Meldrum. Willoughby quarrelled with Manchester and was forced to make an apology to the House of Lords as a result. Furthermore, Cromwell himself saw fit to complain about the conduct of Willoughby's soldiers.\n\nIn the next few years, Willoughby became the leader of the Presbyterian force within Parliament, opposed the formation of the New Model Army and was elected as speaker of the House of Lords in July, 1647. However, when the Parliamentary army took London in September, Willoughby was imprisoned along with six other peers and held for four months at which point he was released without charge, fleeing to the Netherlands to join the Royalists.\n\nNow espousing the Royalist cause, Willoughby was promoted to Vice Admiral under the Duke of York, an appointment that may have been designed to engender sympathy among Scots and Presbyterians. He was also assigned a command in the 1648 invasion of England under the Prince of Wales. He later surrendered his naval command to Prince Rupert of the Rhine. When Parliament confiscated his estates, he travelled to the Caribbean.\n\nHe was appointed Governor of Barbados by Charles II. He arrived at Barbados and took up the appointment in May 1650 and attempted to negotiate the strained politics of that island, which also experienced a division between Royalists and Parliamentarians. During this time he also sent a small colonizing party led by Major Anthony Rowse to Suriname, which established Willoughbyland in honor of the governor. The chief settlement was centred around Fort Willoughby (now Paramaribo).\n\nOn 25 October 1651, a seven ship force under Commodore George Ayscue arrived off Barbados, demanding that the island submit \"for the use of the Parliament of England\". Willoughby's reply (tellingly addressed to \"His Majesty's ship \"Rainbow\"\") was unyielding, declaring that he knew \"no supreme authority over Englishmen but the King\". With some 400 horsemen and 6,000 militia, he was prepared to resist any attempt at coercion.\n\nOver the next month Barbados was blockaded. In early December, with the Royalist cause defeated in England, Ayscue began a series of raids against fortifications on the island and was reinforced by a group of thirteen ships bound for Virginia. On 17 December a force of more than 1,000 Barbadian militia was defeated by one of Ayscue's detachments. Governor Willoughby attempted to stem the spread of Parliamentary sympathies by hanging two of the returning militia soldiers and prohibiting the reading of documents from the blockading fleet. The Royalists held out for several more weeks until one of Willoughby's own commanders declared himself for Parliament. A battle was averted by a week of rain, after which Willoughby, perhaps having seen the hopelessness of his cause, sought negotiations. He was replaced as governor but Barbados and the Royalists there were not punished. Additionally, Willoughby's properties in England were restored. He returned to them in August 1652.\n\nWhile he was twice imprisoned during The Protectorate for involvement in Royalist intrigues, Willoughby survived the Cromwell years and after the Restoration in 1660 he was again appointed to a governorship in the Caribbean, administering the colonies at Saint Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, and Antigua.\n\nIn June 1664 he organized an expedition from Barbados against the small French garrison at Saint Lucia, expelling it under the pretext that a half-Carib native had effectively \"sold\" it to England and establishing a short-lived English colony there.\n\nDuring the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Willoughby engaged in another expedition, sailing to the Dutch island of Tobago in July 1665. Finding a force under the English privateer Robert Searle already looting the settlement there, he put a stop to the destruction and installed a garrison of fifty men to maintain order.\n\nHis last act on behalf of the English crown came in July 1666 when, having learned of the recent French seizure of Saint Kitts, he formed a relief force of two Royal Navy frigates, twelve other large vessels (including commandeered merchant ships), a fire ship, and a ketch, bearing over 1,000 men. He planned to proceed north to Nevis, Montserrat, and Antigua to gather further reinforcements before descending on the French. Leaving Barbados on 28 July, his force prowled off Martinique and then Guadeloupe, where he sent a frigate to assault the harbor and capture two merchant vessels on 4 August. This success could not be exploited however as that night most of his force was destroyed by a strong hurricane, including the flagship \"Hope\", from which Willoughby did not emerge.\n\nFrancis Willoughby and Elizabeth Cecil had four children:\n\nIn his will, he left extensive holdings in Barbados, Antigua, and Suriname to his children and his nephew Henry Willoughby as well as smaller grants of currency or sugar to various associates and servants.\n\n"}

It was first used in the 1885 general election, but has undergone various boundary changes since that date.\n\nThere was also an Aberdeen North Holyrood constituency, a constituency of the Scottish Parliament, created in 1999 with the boundaries of the Westminster constituency of at that time. It was abolished in 2011 by the new constituencies of Aberdeen Donside and Aberdeen Central.\n\nAs redefined by the Fifth Review of the Boundary Commission for Scotland, and subsequently first used in the 2005 general election, Aberdeen North is entirely within the Aberdeen City council area and one of five constituencies covering that council area and the Aberdeenshire council area. To the south of Aberdeen North there is Aberdeen South, which is also entirely within the Aberdeen City area. To the west there is West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, which is entirely within the Aberdeenshire area, and to the north there is Gordon, which covers part of the Aberdeen City area and part of the Aberdeenshire area. Further north there is Banff and Buchan which, like West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, is entirely within the Aberdeenshire area.\n\nFifth Review changes include the transfer of Bridge of Don, Dyce and Danestone areas from Aberdeen North to Gordon, and the new Aberdeen North has boundaries which are very different from those of the earlier constituency. The northern boundary of the earlier constituency coincided with the northern boundary of the Aberdeen City area. At that time, Aberdeen Central and Aberdeen South covered the rest of the Aberdeen City area, and all three \"Aberdeen\" constituencies were entirely within the council area.\n\nFrom 1832 to 1885 there was a single Aberdeen constituency. Prior to 1832, the burgh of Aberdeen had been represented as a component of the Aberdeen Burghs constituency.\n\nWhen Aberdeen North was created by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 and first used in the 1885 general election, so was Aberdeen South. Aberdeen North then consisted of the municipal wards of St Clement, St Andrew, St Machar and Greyfriars, and the 10th and 11th Parliamentary Polling Districts. The rest of the county of Aberdeen was covered by the county constituencies of Eastern Aberdeenshire and Western Aberdeenshire.\n\nThe same boundaries were used in the 1886 general election, the 1892 general election, the 1895 general election, the 1900 general election, the 1906 general election, the January 1910 general election and the December 1910 general election.\n\nIn 1918 constituency boundaries were redefined by the Representation of the People Act 1918. By then the City of Aberdeen had been created and, together with Aberdeen North, Aberdeen South became one of two constituencies covering the city (which was one of four counties of cities in Scotland) and entirely within the city. The new boundaries were first used in the 1918 general election, and Aberdeen North then consisted of the wards of Greyfriars, St Andrew, St Clement, St Machar, Torry and Woodside. The county of Aberdeen was covered by Aberdeen and Kincardine East, Central Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and West Aberdeenshire. Aberdeen and Kincardine East and Central Aberdeenshire were entirely within the county of Aberdeen. Kincardine and West Aberdeenshire covered the county of Kincardine minus the burgh of Inverbervie, which was covered by Montrose Burghs, and part of the county of Aberdeen.\n\nThe same boundaries were used in the 1922 general election, the 1923 general election, the 1924 general election, the 1929 general election, the 1931 general election, the 1935 general election and the 1945 general election.\n\nFor the 1950 general election boundaries were redefined again, by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. A new list of wards defined Aberdeen North - Glimonston, Greyfriars, St Clement, St Machar, St Nicholas and Woodside - but the City of Aberdeen remained a two-constituency city, divided between Aberdeen South and Aberdeen North, with both constituencies entirely within the city.\n\nThe county of Aberdeen was now again divided between East Aberdeenshire and West Aberdeenshire, with both of these constituencies entirely within the county.\n\nThe same boundaries were used for the 1951 general election.\n\nBy the time of the 1955 general election, a boundary review had taken account of a small enlargement of the city area, and Aberdeen North was defined as consisting of the wards of Cairncry, St Andrews, St Clement's, St Machar, St Nicholas and Woodside. The same boundaries were used for the 1959 general election, the 1964 general election, the 1966 general election and the 1970 general election.\n\nFor the February 1974 general election there was, again, no change to the boundaries of Aberdeen North, but a review had defined the constituency in terms of a new list of wards. The new wards were Mastrick, Northfield, St Clement's, St Machar, St Nicholas, and Woodside. February 1974 boundaries were used also for the October 1974 general election.\n\nIn 1975, throughout Scotland, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, counties were abolished, and the City of Aberdeen was enlarged to include areas formerly within the county of Aberdeen and the county of Kincardine. Also, the city became a district within the Grampian region. The enlarged city included areas covered by the constituencies of West Aberdeenshire and North Angus and Mearns. North Angus and Mearns had been created in 1950 to cover the county of Kincardine and part of the county of Angus.\n\nThe 1979 general election was held before a review of constituency boundaries took account of new local government boundaries.\n\nIn this period the constituency was made up of the City of Aberdeen District electoral divisions of Ashgrove, Brimmond, Kittybrewster, Mastrick, Northfield East, Northfield West, St Machar, Seaton, Summerfield, and Woodside.\n\nThe 1983 general election, the 1987 general election and the 1992 general election took place during this period.\n\nIn 1996, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, local government regions and districts were abolished and the city became one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland. Also, the name of the city became, officially, \"Aberdeen City\".\n\nIn this period the constituency was made up of the City of Aberdeen District electoral divisions of Balgownie, Brimmond, Danestone, Mastrick, Middleton, Northfield, Summerfield, and West Don, as provided for by the Parliamentary Constituencies (Scotland) Order 1995.\n\nSince 2005 the constituency is made up of the Aberdeen City Council wards of Auchmill, Berryden, Castlehill, Cummings Park, Donmouth, Hilton, Kittybrewster, Mastrick, Midstocket, Newhills, Pittodrie, St Machar, Seaton, Sheddocksley, Springhill, Stockethill, Summerhill, Sunnybank, and Woodside, as provided for by the Parliamentary Constituencies (Scotland) Order 2005.\n\nAs redefined for the 1997 general election Aberdeen North was one of three constituencies covering and entirely within the Aberdeen City area, the other two being Aberdeen South and Aberdeen Central. Aberdeen South shared boundaries with both of the other two constituencies.\n\nThis was the largest SNP vote share and majority in percentage terms at the 2019 general election, although the party had a higher numerical majority in other seats.\n\n \n\n \n\nPirie was endorsed by the Coalition Government but refused to give it his support.\n"}

In 2010, Eilidh Whiteford succeeded Salmond – by then First Minister of Scotland – as the constituency's MP, but the SNP vote share fell below 50% for the first time since 1992, due to a strong challenge by the Conservative Party. In the 2015 general election, the SNP achieved its best ever result in the constituency, with Whiteford winning over 60% of the vote and increasing her majority to 31.4%. The constituency saw the second-largest swing to the Conservatives in all of Scotland (20.2%), bested only by the swing the Conservatives achieved in defeating Salmond in the neighboring seat of Gordon (20.4%). In the 2019 election, Banff and Buchan's Conservative vote share bucked the Scottish trend and increased by 2.1%, increasing Duguid’s majority to over 4,000 votes and taking over 50% of the vote share.\n\nThe Aberdeenshire council area as a whole voted against Scottish independence in 2014.

As a result of the 2005 boundary changes, in accordance with the Fifth Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission for Scotland, the Gordon constituency is now one of five covering the Aberdeenshire council area and the Aberdeen City council area.\n\nThe Gordon constituency now covers a central portion of the Aberdeenshire area and a northern portion of the Aberdeen City area. Entirely within the Aberdeenshire area, there is also Banff and Buchan, to the north of Gordon, and West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, to the south.

The boundaries of the constituency stretch down into Aberdeen to the south-east, to cover the city's northern suburbs of Bankhead, Bridge of Don, Danestone and Dyce. Oil, agriculture and tourism form an important part of the local economy, with most of the constituency's settlements around Aberdeen serving as commuter territory for the city, including the towns of Inverurie and Kintore and the villages of Balmedie and Newmachar, where there is rapid population growth, with many areas seeing their population double within the last decade. Various energy companies have representations in Dyce and Bridge of Don, among which are EMS Oil and GE Oil and Gas. The constituency also covers Aberdeen International Airport in Dyce, Scotland's third-busiest airport by passenger numbers. Huntly, approximately 40 miles north-west of Aberdeen, is the historic home of the Gordon Highlanders regiment and is the site of Huntly Castle, the ancestral home of the chief of Clan Gordon. Huntly is also the headquarters of Dean's bakers, who produce shortbread. Ellon, approximately 16 miles north of Aberdeen, is a coastal resort sitting on the mouth of the River Ythan. On the outskirts of the town is a brewery owned by BrewDog.\n\nIn the UK Parliament, Gordon was traditionally a Liberal-Conservative marginal. The constituency's predecessor seats of East Aberdeenshire and West Aberdeenshire were previously represented by the Conservatives. When Gordon was first formed in 1983, it was narrowly won by Malcolm Bruce of the Liberals, with a slender majority of 850 votes. Bruce subsequently increased his majority tenfold in 1987, before seeing it cut to just 274 in 1992, in new boundaries which benefited the Conservative Party. Since the Conservatives' landslide defeat in 1997, Gordon had returned Bruce of the Liberal Democrats with an increasing strong majority until Richard Thomson of the Scottish National Party cut his majority down by nearly 4,000 votes in 2010. In the nationwide SNP landslide victory in 2015, Salmond, former First Minister of Scotland and SNP Leader, gained the seat for the SNP with a majority of 8,687 votes ahead of the Liberal Democrats; with Bruce standing down. Salmond previously represented the coterminous Gordon constituency in the Scottish Parliament from 2007 until his retirement from the Scottish Parliament in 2016.\n\nIn the Scottish Parliament, Gordon was first represented by Nora Radcliffe of the Liberal Democrats in 1999. The constituency was a three-way marginal between the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and SNP. Alex Salmond gained the constituency in 2007 with a 2,000 majority, increasing it to over 15,000 votes in 2011. More recently the Conservatives have made a strong comeback in Gordon, gaining the overlapping Aberdeenshire West constituency in 2016, and coming second behind the SNP in the overlapping constituencies of Aberdeen Donside and Aberdeenshire East.\n\nAt the 2016 European Union membership referendum, the Gordon constituency is estimated to have voted to Remain within the European Union on a margin of 55.5% Remain 44.5% Leave, an above-average Leave vote relative to the rest of Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives took the most votes in the area at the 2017 local council elections, prompting party leader Ruth Davidson to say on a visit to Inverurie that \"We won the local government election in Gordon this week, beating the SNP into second place. It means that in this seat, as in many others, it is a two-horse race between us and the [Scottish] Nationalists.\" In response to Davidson's comments, the SNP MP for Gordon at the time, Alex Salmond said: “It’s just arrogance, for Ruth Davidson to continue the line of ‘we’re going to take this seat, and we’re going to take that seat’. Once it doesn’t happen, it’s very bad news for Ruth Davidson’s credibility.”\n\nSalmond was later unseated by Conservative Colin Clark at the 2017 snap election on 8 June. The swing to the Conservatives was 20.4%, the party's largest swing in the whole UK. However, in the 2019 election, Thomson—by now an Aberdeenshire Councillor—narrowly regained the seat for the SNP with a majority of 819 (1.4%), meaning the seat remains an SNP-Conservative marginal.\n\n \n\nBefore the 2005 general election, Scotland went through major boundary changes. \n"}
{"id": "1797841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797841", "title": "Sally port", "text": "Sally port\n\nA sally port is a secure, controlled entry way to a fortification or prison. The entrance is usually protected by some means, such as a fixed wall on the outside, parallel to the door, which must be circumvented to enter and prevents direct enemy fire from a distance. It may include two sets of doors that can be barred independently to further delay enemy penetration. \n\nFrom around 1600 to 1900, a sally port was a sort of dock where boats picked up or dropped off ship crews from vessels anchored offshore. That meaning occasionally still occurs, especially in coastal Great Britain.\n\nThe word \"port\" is ultimately from Latin for door. Often the term postern is used synonymously. It can also mean a tunnel, or passage (i.e., a secret exit for those besieged).\n\nA \"sally\", ultimately derived from Latin (to jump), or \"salle\" sortie, is a military maneuver, typically during a siege, made by a defending force to harass isolated or vulnerable attackers before retreating to their defenses. Sallies are a common way for besieged forces to reduce the strength and preparedness of a besieging army; a sally port is therefore essentially a door in a castle or city wall, that allows troops to make sallies without compromising the defensive strength of fortifications.\n\nTargets for these raids included tools, which defenders could capture and use—and labor-intensive enemy works and equipment, such as trenches, mines, siege engines, and siege towers. Sometimes the defenders also attacked enemy laborers, and stole or destroyed the besiegers' beer and food supplies.\n\nAn extract from a 19th-century dictionary of military terms describes a sally port thus:\nthose underground passages, which lead from the inner to the outward works ; such as from the higher flank to the lower, to the tenailles, or the communication from the middle of the curtain to the ravelin. When they are constructed for the passage of men only, they are made with steps at the entrance, and outlet. They are about six feet wide, and feet high []. There is also a gutter or shore made under the sally-ports that are in the middle of the curtains, in order that the water which runs down the streets may pass into the ditch ; but this can only be done when they are wet ditches. When sally-ports serve to carry guns through them for the out-works, instead of making them with steps, they must have a gradual slope, and be eight feet wide.\n\nA sally port appears on the coat of arms of Malta.\n\n"}
