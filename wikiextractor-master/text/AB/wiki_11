It is used to either print a list of environment variables or run another utility in an altered environment without having to modify the currently existing environment. Using env, variables may be added or removed, and existing variables may be changed by assigning new values to them.\n\nIn practice, env has another common use. It is often used by shell scripts to launch the correct interpreter. In this usage, the environment is typically not changed.\n\nThe version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Richard Mlynarik and David MacKenzie. It first appeared in 4.4BSD, and is a part of POSIX.1 (with the option only).\n\nGNU's has been extended to handle signals and the current directory. FreeBSD's supports a custom search path. Extensions found in both versions include , for unsetting variables, and , for splitting arguments (mainly in shebang).\n\nTo print out a list of all environment variables, simply run env without any arguments:\n\nenv\nTo clear the environment (creating a new environment without any existing environment variables) for a new shell:\n\nenv -i /bin/sh\nTo launch the X application xcalc and have it appear on a different display:\n\nenv DISPLAY=foo.bar:1.0 xcalc\nNote that this use of env is often unnecessary since most shells support setting environment variables in front of a command:\n\nDISPLAY=foo.bar:1.0 xcalc\nenv may also be used in the hashbang line of a script to allow the interpreter to be looked up via the PATH.

The environment is not altered.\n\nNote that it is possible to specify the interpreter without using env, by giving the full path of the python interpreter. A problem with that approach is that on different computer systems, the exact path may be different. By instead using env as in the example, the interpreter is searched for and located at the time the script is run (more precisely, env does a system call to execvp, which does the job of locating the interpreter and launching it). This makes the script more portable, but also increases the risk that the wrong interpreter is selected because it searches for a match in every directory on the executable search path. It also suffers from the same problem in that the path to the env binary may also be different on a per-machine basis.\n\n\n"}

He reached the semifinals of the Australian Open singles on three occasions, and won the doubles in 1975 and 1982. He also played in the Australian team that won the 1977 Davis Cup. After the end of his playing career, Alexander worked as a tennis commentator and managed various sports-related businesses.\n\nAlexander won the Division of Bennelong for the Liberal Party at the 2010 election, and retained the seat in 2013 and 2016. He resigned effective 11 November 2017 due to constitutional ineligibility arising from his dual citizenship of the United Kingdom. He renounced his UK citizenship and stood as the Liberal Party candidate at the by-election, held on 16 December 2017, which he won.\n\nAlexander was born in Sydney. His father, Gilbert Alexander, was born in Essex, England, in 1907 and moved to Australia at the age of three.\n\nDuring a tennis career spanning the late 1960s to mid-1980s, Alexander won seven tour singles titles and 27 doubles titles, and earned a total of $1,214,079 (USD) in prize money. He achieved a career best singles ranking of World No. 8 in December 1975. Alexander is the youngest player to represent Australia in the Davis Cup. He was also one of Australia's longest serving Davis Cup players, representing his country from 1968 to 1983. From 1974 to 1986, Alexander served as the resident tennis professional at Lamar Hunt's World Championship Tennis Peachtree World of Tennis Club in Peachtree Corners, Georgia US.\n\nAlexander served as captain of the Australian Fed Cup team and worked as a sports commentator for Australian (Channel 7) and British (BBC) television networks for over 20 years.\n\nAs managing director of Next Generation Clubs Australia, Alexander designed and built sport and fitness clubs; including the Ryde Aquatic Centre in Sydney to host the 2000 Summer Olympic Games water polo event, the development of Memorial Drive in Adelaide into a multi-function health and fitness facility, and Royal King's Park in Perth.\n\nIn 1995 Alexander served as referee during the first series run of the Australian adaptation of the television series Gladiators.\n\nShortly before his election to Parliament in 2010, Alexander's Tennis Professionals won a High Court case for the right to redevelop the White City Tennis Centre in Sydney.\n\nAlexander also managed a variety of small businesses in the retail and sporting sectors.\n\nAs a Liberal Party candidate, John Alexander won the seat of Bennelong from the Australian Labor Party in the 2010 election with a swing of 4.52 points, giving a two-party-preferred margin of 3.1 points.\n\nAlexander delivered his maiden speech to parliament on 28 October 2010, detailing his particular interest in areas of preventative health, infrastructure, transport and sustainable growth. During his first term Alexander was put in charge of several internal policy committees, with a particular focus on regional development and policies to tackle urban congestion.\n\nIn October 2011 Alexander ran the inaugural Bennelong Cup Table Tennis Test match, involving players from China, Korea and Australia playing in a formal competition in Ryde, a suburb within his constituency. In October 2012 the opening games were played in the Great Hall of Parliament House, Canberrathe first competitive sporting event ever played there. The Ambassadors for China and Korea participated in a friendly competition with Alexander and Minister for Sport Kate Lundy. The Bennelong Cup is the celebration of Alexander's Bennelong Schools Table Tennis Program which has put tables in all 40 Bennelong schools in order to encourage social interaction between students of different cultural backgrounds, together with a healthy activity. The Bennelong Cup has continued every year since with an interschool tournament followed by international competition in Ryde, preceded by exhibition matches in Parliament House, Canberra.\n\nAlexander has also established a range of other local programs including Bennelong Gardens, which provides work opportunities for people with disabilities in specially designed market gardens, and Bennelong Village Business program which promotes the benefits of local small business shopping and negotiates discounted advertising rates for small businesses in the local newspaper. John Alexander received much publicity for his 100Â km charity walk around Bennelong to raise money and awareness of motor neurone disease after the loss of two close friends to the disease.\n\nAlexander was not challenged in Liberal preselection in 2012. In the 2013 election Alexander was re-elected as Member for Bennelong, increasing his two party preferred margin to 7.8 points.\n\nIn September 2013 Alexander was appointed chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Tax & Revenue, a role in which he worked on improving access to 'light touch' tax returns for individuals with simple tax affairs. Following this he was appointed chair of the House Standing Committee on Economics, where he instigated an inquiry into home ownership and opportunities for tax reform. Following Malcolm Turnbull's ascension to Prime Minister John Alexander was appointed chair of the newly formed House Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport & Cities, where he commenced an inquiry into transport connectivity, regional development, high speed rail and the use of value capture as an innovative funding mechanism.\n\nAlexander also served as chair of the Coalition Policy Committees on Infrastructure & Regional Development, and on Tourism, of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, and of the Australia-East Asia Parliamentary Network.\n\nAs a strong proponent of high-speed rail linking Australia's eastern seaboard, Alexander delivered the keynote speech at a high-speed rail conference at University of Melbourne in February 2014, highlighting the resultant opportunities for regional development and reduction in traffic congestion in major cities.\n\nAlexander was not challenged in Liberal preselection in 2016. In the 2016 election, he was re-elected as member for Bennelong.\n\nDuring the Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, on 6 November 2017, it was reported that Alexander might also be a British citizen and so had never been eligible for election to the Parliament. On 11 November 2017, Alexander resigned from parliament after conceding that he was likely a dual citizen, necessitating a by-election in Bennelong. He renounced his UK citizenship and stood as the Liberal Party candidate at the by-election, held on 16 December 2017, which he won.\n\nAlexander was briefly married, while in the United States, to a Canadian model and later married to Rosemary Brown, a former Olympic swimmer, for almost ten years. He and the former Ms. Brown have three children: Emily (1990), Georgia (1991) and Charles (1994).

The station is served by the following lines.\n\n\n\nAlthough the main JR train station and the subway station are physically separate, there are underground passageways connecting the two. The main Sendai Station is above-ground, and is a hub for JR East containing both the Tohoku and Akita Shinkansen lines and several other local lines. The above-ground portion of Sendai Station lies in Aoba-ku, and is situated so that tracks run roughly north-south. In the station's easternmost section, underground and across the ward border in Miyagino-ku, is the platform for the east-west Senseki Line. Originally, this platform was also above ground; but in 2000, the line was extended to Aoba-dÅri to the west, and the line was re-routed underground beneath the rest of the station.\n\nThe Sendai Subway lies to the west, and can be accessed from the main station via underground passageways at both ends of the station. The platform for the subway at Sendai Station is actually closer to Aoba-dÅri Station than the other JR lines in Sendai Station. In fact, there is a transfer-only gate between the subway and Senseki Line platform at Aoba-dÅri Station.\n\nThe Namboku Line platforms are located on the third basement (\"B3F\") level, and the Tozai Line platforms are located on the fourth basement (\"B4F\") level.\n\nThe station first opened on 15 December 1887.\n\nIn fiscal 2016, the JR East station was used by an average of 87,340 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the busiest JR East station outside of the Greater Tokyo Area. It is also the busiest JR East station in Miyagi Prefecture and the 50th-busiest on the JR East network as a whole. In fiscal 2015, the Sendai Subway portion of the station was used by an average of 48,640 passengers daily.\n\nThe JR East passenger figures (boarding passengers only) for previous years are as shown below.\n\nThe area outside the west exit of Sendai Station is the traditional center of activity around the station. This is because the area is closer to the central business district of Sendai, which initially developed around Sendai Castle.\n\nThe area is home to some of the largest department stores in Sendai. The S-Pal department store and the Station are directly connected to each other. A large elevated walkway outside the exit provides access to other department stores, such as the Loft Department Store, Sakurano Department Store, the Jujiya Co. Sendai Store, and EBeanS. EbeanS is home to Junkudo Sendai, the largest bookstore in the Tohoku Region. The AER Building, a large office building built through recent redevelopment, is also located in the area and is home to various offices and stores, such as Maruzen, another large bookstore.\n\nThe area around the Asaichi-dori street, next to EBeanS, is known as the Sendai Asaichi (Sendai morning Market), although stores are open all day long. The Asaichi is home to a wide variety of small stores that mainly sell Japanese foods.\n\nThe Sendai Metropolitan Hotel can be directly accessed via the elevated walkway and is extremely convenient for visitors unfamiliar with the area. The entrance to Sendai's largest shopping malls, such as the Clis Road Shopping District and the Ichibancho Shopping District, are located close to the exit of the elevated walkway, and a bus exchange area and taxi pool can be found under the walkway.\n\nThe area outside the east exit of Sendai Station is the \"new\" side of the station. It traditionally had a smaller concentration of businesses compared to the west side. That the area was not damaged by World War II bombing also delayed development in the area.\n\nThe municipal government decided to conduct redevelopment in the area in 1960. The redevelopment project is still in progress, but the area has already been largely renovated with a new bus exchange area and taxi pool. The Yodobashi Camera Sendai Store, one of the largest electronics retailers in Sendai, is located right outside of the east exit and BiVi Sendai, a department store, is located close by. The east side of the station is close to many entertainment venues, such as Beeb Sendai and Sendai Sunplaza. Miyagi Baseball Stadium is within walking distance.\n\n"}

{"id": "1927720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927720", "title": "Senusret II", "text": "Senusret II\n\nKhakheperre Senusret II was the fourth pharaoh of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt. He ruled from 1897 BC to 1878 BC. His pyramid was constructed at El-Lahun. Senusret II took a great deal of interest in the Faiyum oasis region and began work on an extensive irrigation system from Bahr Yussef through to Lake Moeris through the construction of a dike at El-Lahun and the addition of a network of drainage canals. The purpose of his project was to increase the amount of cultivable land in that area. The importance of this project is emphasized by Senusret II's decision to move the royal necropolis from Dahshur to El-Lahun where he built his pyramid. This location would remain the political capital for the 12th and 13th Dynasties of Egypt. The king also established the first known workers' quarter in the nearby town of Senusrethotep (Kahun).\n\nUnlike his successor, Senusret II maintained good relations with the various nomarchs or provincial governors of Egypt who were almost as wealthy as the pharaoh. His Year 6 is attested in a wall painting from the tomb of a local nomarch named Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan.\n\nCo-regencies are a major issue for Egyptologists' understanding of the history of the Middle Kingdom and the Twelfth Dynasty. The French Egyptologist Claude Obsomer wholly rejects the possibility of co-regencies in the Twelfth Dynasty. Author Robert D. Delia, and German Eyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln have investigated Obsomer's work and have concluded in favour of co-regencies. Jansen-Winkeln cites a rock stele found at Konosso as irrefutable evidence in favour of a co-regency between Senusret II and Amenemhat II, and by extension proof of co-regencies in the Twelfth Dynasty. The American Egyptologist William J. Murnane states that \"the co-regencies of the period are all known ... from double-dated documents\". The German Egyptologist Schneider concludes that recently discovered documents and archaeological evidence are effectively proof of co-regencies in this period.\n\nSome sources ascribe a co-regency period to Senusret II's rule, with his father Amenemhat II as his co-regent. The British Egyptologist Peter Clayton ascribes at least three years of co-regency to Senusret II's reign. The French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal assigns nearly five years of co-regency prior to sole accession to the throne.\n\nThe lengths of the reigns of Senusret II and Senusret III are one of the main considerations for discerning the chronology of the Twelfth Dynasty. The Turin Canon is believed to assign a reign of 19 years to Senusret II and 30 years of reign to Senusret III. This traditional view was challenged in 1972 when the American Egyptologist William Kelly Simpson observed that the latest attested regnal year for Senusret II was his 7th, and similarly for Senusret III his 19th.\n\nKim Ryholt, a professor of Egyptology at the University of Copenhagen, suggests the possibility that the names on the canon had been misarranged and offers two possible regnal lengths for Senusret II: 10+ years, or 19 years. Several Egyptologists, such as Thomas Schneider, cite Mark C. Stone's article, published in the GÃ¶ttinger Miszellen in 1997, as determining that Senusret II's highest recorded regnal year was his 8th, based on Stela Cairo JE 59485.\n\nSome scholars prefer to ascribe him a reign of only 10 years and assign the 19-year reign to Senusret III instead. Other Egyptologists, however, such as JÃ¼rgen von Beckerath and Frank Yurco, have maintained the traditional view of a longer 19-year reign for Senusret II given the level of activity undertaken by the king during his reign. Yurco notes that reducing Senusret II's regnal length to 6 years poses difficulties because:\n\nAt present, the problem concerning the reign length of Senusret II is irresolvable but many Egyptologists today prefer to assign him a reign of 9 or 10 years only given the absence of higher dates attested for him beyond his 8th regnal year. This would entail amending the 19-year figure which the Turin Canon assigns for a 12th dynasty ruler in his position to 9 years instead. However, Senusret II's monthly figure on the throne might be ascertained. According to JÃ¼rgen von Beckerath, the temple documents of El-Lahun, the pyramid city of Sesostris/Senusret II often mention the Festival of \"Going Forth to Heaven\" which might be the date of death for this ruler. These documents state that this Festival occurred on IV Peret day 14.\n\nThe Faiyum Oasis, a region in Middle Egypt, has been inhabited by humans for more than 8000 years. It became an important centre in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom. Throughout the period, rulers undertook developmental projects turning Faiyum into an agricultural, religious, and resort-like centre. The oasis was located south-west of Memphis offering arable land centred around Lake Moeris, a natural body of water.\n\nSenusret II initiated a project to exploit the marshy region's natural resources for hunting and fishing, a project continued by his successors and which \"matured\" during the reign of his grandson Amenemhat III. To set off this project, Senusret II developed an irrigation system with a dyke and a network of canals which siphoned water from Lake Moeris. The land reclaimed in this project was then farmed.\n\nCults honouring the crocodile god Sobek were prominent at the time.\n\nSenusret II's reign ushered in a period of peace and prosperity, with no recorded military campaigns and the proliferation of trade between Egypt and the Near-East.\n\nThere is an absence of serious evidence for a co-regency between Senusret II and Senusret III. Murnane identifies that the only existing evidence for a coregency of Senusret II and III is a scarab with both kings names inscribed on it. The association can be explained as being the result of retroactive dating where Senusret II's final regnal year was absorbed into Senusret III's first one, as would be supported by contemporaneous evidence from the Turin Canon which give Senusret II a regnal duration of 19 full regnal years and a partial one. A dedicatory inscription celebrating the resumption of rituals begun by Senusret II and III, and a papyrus with entries identifying Senusret II's nineteenth regnal year and Senusret III's first regnal year are scant evidence and do not necessitate a coregency. Murnane argues that if there was a coregency, it could not have lasted more than a few months.\n\nThe evidence from the papyrus document is now obviated by the fact that the document has been securely dated to Year 19 of Senusret III and Year 1 of Amenemhet III. At present, no document from Senusret II's reign has been discovered from Lahun, the king's new capital city.\n\nIn 1889, the English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie found \"a marvellous gold and inlaid royal uraeus\" that must have originally formed part of Senusret II's looted burial equipment in a flooded chamber of the king's pyramid tomb. It is now located in the Cairo Museum. The tomb of Princess Sithathoriunet, a daughter of Senusret II, was also discovered by Egyptologists in a separate burial site. Several pieces of jewellery from her tomb including a pair of pectorals and a crown or diadem were found there. They are now displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of New York or the Cairo Museum in Egypt.\n\nIn 2009, Egyptian archaeologists announced the results of new excavations led by egyptologist Abdul Rahman Al-Ayedi. They described unearthing a cache of pharaonic-era mummies in brightly painted wooden coffins near the Lahun pyramid. The mummies were reportedly the first to be found in the sand-covered desert rock surrounding the pyramid.\n\nThe pyramid was built around a framework of limestone radial arms, similar to the framework used by Senusret I. Instead of using an infill of stones, mud and mortar, Senusret II used an infill of mud bricks before cladding the structure with a layer of limestone veneer. The outer cladding stones were locked together using dovetail inserts, some of which still remain. A trench was dug around the central core that was filled with stones to act as a French Drain. The limestone cladding stood in this drain, indicating that Senusret II was concerned with water damage.\n\nThere were eight mastabas and one small pyramid to the north of Senusret's complex and all were within the enclosure wall. The wall had been encased in limestone that was decorated with niches, perhaps as a copy of Djoser's complex at Saqqara. The mastabas were solid and no chambers have found within or beneath, indicating that they were cenotaphs and possibly symbolic in nature. Flinders Petrie investigated the auxiliary pyramid and found no chambers.\n\nThe entrances to the underground chambers were on the southern side of the pyramid, which confused Flinders Petrie for some months as he looked for the entrance on the traditional northern side.\n\nThe builders' vertical access shaft had been filled in after construction and the chamber made to look like a burial chamber. This was no doubt an attempt to convince tomb robbers to look no further.\n\nA secondary access shaft led to a vaulted chamber and a deep well shaft. This may have been an aspect of the cult of Osiris, although it may have been to find the water table. A passage led northwards, past another lateral chamber and turned westwards. This led to an antechamber and vaulted burial chamber, with a sidechamber to the south. The burial chamber was encircled by a unique series of passages that may have reference to the birth of Osiris. A large sarcophagus was found within the burial chamber; it is larger than the doorway and the tunnels, showing that it was put in position when the chamber was being constructed and it was open to the sky.\nThe limestone outer cladding of the pyramid was removed by Rameses II so he could re-use the stone for his own use. He left inscriptions that he had done so.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He ruled from 1878 BC to 1839 BC during a time of great power and prosperity, and was the fifth king of the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. He was a great pharaoh of the Twelfth Dynasty and is considered to be, perhaps, the most powerful Egyptian ruler of the dynasty. Consequently, he is regarded as one of the sources for the legend about Sesostris. His military campaigns gave rise to an era of peace and economic prosperity that reduced the power of regional rulers and led to a revival in craftwork, trade, and urban development. Senusret III was among the few Egyptian kings who were deified and honored with a cult during their own lifetime.\n\nSenusret III was the son of Senusret II and Khenemetneferhedjet I, also called Khenemetneferhedjet I Weret (\"the elder\"). Three wives of Senusret III are known for certain. These are Itakayt, Khenemetneferhedjet II and Neferthenut, all three mainly known from their burials next to the pyramid of the king at Dahshur. Several daughters are known, although they also are attested only by the burials around the king's pyramid and their exact relation to the king is disputable. These include Sithathor, Menet, Senetsenebtysy, and Meret. Amenemhat III was most likely a son of the king. Other sons are not known.\n\nSenusret III cleared a navigable canal through the first cataract of the Nile River, (this was different from the Canal of the Pharaohs, which apparently, Senusret III also tried to build). He also relentlessly pushed his kingdom's expansion into Nubia (from 1866 to 1863 BC) where he erected massive river forts including Buhen, Semna, Shalfak and Toshka at Uronarti.\n\nHe carried out at least four major campaigns into Nubia in his Years 8, 10, 16, and 19. His Year 8 stela at Semna documents his victories against the Nubians, through which he is thought to have made safe the southern frontier, preventing further incursions into Egypt. Another great stela from Semna dated to the third month of Year 16 of his reign mentions his military activities against both Nubia and Canaan. In it, he admonished his future successors to maintain the new border that he had created:\n\nHis final campaign, which was in his Year 19, was less successful because the king's forces were caught with the Nile being lower than normal and they had to retreat and abandon their campaign in order to avoid being trapped in hostile Nubian territory.\nSuch was his forceful nature and immense influence that Senusret III was worshipped as a deity in Semna by later generations. Jacques Morgan, in 1894, found rock inscriptions near Sehel Island documenting his digging of a canal. Senusret III erected a temple and town in Abydos, and another temple in Medamud.\n\nHis court included the viziers Sobekemhat, Nebit, and Khnumhotep. Ikhernofret worked as treasurer for the king at Abydos. Senankh cleared the canal at Sehel for the king.\n\nA double-dated papyrus in the Berlin Museum shows Year 20 of his reign next to Year 1 of his son, Amenemhat III; generally, this is presumed to be a proof for a coregency with his son, which should have been started in this year. According to Josef W. Wegner, a Year 39 hieratic control note was recovered on a white limestone block from:\nWegner stresses that it is unlikely that Amenemhat III, Senusret's son and successor, would still be working on his father's temple nearly four decades into his own reign. He notes that the only possible explanation for the block's existence at the project is that Senusret III had a 39-year reign, with the final 20 years in coregency with his son Amenemhat III. Since the project was associated with a project of Senusret III, his Regnal Year was presumably used to date the block, rather than Year 20 of Amenemhat III. Wegner interprets this as an implication that Senusret was still alive in the first two decades of his son's reign.\n\nWegner's hypothesis is rejected by some scholars, such as Pierre Tallet and Harco Willems; according to them, it is more likely that such a coregency never occurred, and that the Year 39 control note still refers to Amenemhat III, who may have ordered some additions to Senusret's monuments.\n\nSenusret's pyramid complex was built north-east of the Red Pyramid of Dashur. It far surpassed those from the early twelfth dynasty in size, grandeur, and underlying religious conceptions.\n\nThere has been speculation that Senusret was not necessarily buried there, but rather, in his sophisticated funerary complex in Abydos and his pyramid more likely being a cenotaph.\n\nSenusret's pyramid is 105 meters square and 78 meters high. The total volume was approximately 288,000 cubic meters. The pyramid was built of a core of mud bricks. They were not made a consistent size implying that standardized moulds were not used. The burial chamber was lined with granite. Above the vaulted burial chamber was a second relieving chamber that was roofed with five pairs of limestone beams each weighing 30 tons. Above this was a third mudbrick vault.\n\nThe pyramid complex included a small mortuary temple and seven smaller pyramids for his queens. There is also an underground gallery with further burials for royal women. Here were found the treasures of Sithathor and queen Mereret. There was also a southern temple, however this has since been destroyed.\n\nSenusret III is well known for his distinctive statues, which are almost immediately recognizable as his. On them, the king is depicted at different ages and, in particular, on the aged ones he sports a strikingly somber expression: the eyes are protruding from hollow eye sockets with pouches and lines under them, the mouth and lips have a grimace of bitterness, and the ears are enormous and protruding forward. In sharp contrast with the even-exaggerated realism of the head and, regardless of his age, the rest of the body is idealized as forever young and muscular, in the more classical pharaonic fashion.\n\nScholars could only make assumptions about the reasons why Senusret III chose to have himself portrayed in such a unique way, and polarized on two diverging opinions. Some argue that Senusret wanted to be represented as a lonely and disenchanted ruler, human before divine, consumed by worries and by his responsibilities. At the opposite, other scholars suggested that the statues originally would convey the idea of a dreadful tyrant able to see and hear everything under his strict control.\n\nMore recently, it has been suggested that the purpose of such peculiar portraiture was not to represent realism, but rather, to reveal the perceived nature of royal power at the time of Senusret's reign.\n\nSenusret is a major character in Christian Jacq's historical fiction series \"The Mysteries of Osiris\"\n\nMany conservative biblical scholars consider Senusret the pharaoh mentioned in Genesis 39-47, who elevated Joseph to a high administrative post, answerable directly to him.\n\n\n\nColchis\n"}

The college is named after John Muir, the environmentalist and founder of the Sierra Club. It has a humanitarian emphasis focused on the \"spirit of self-sufficiency and individual choice.\" The college opened in 1967, at the height of the American environmentalist movement triggered in part by Rachel Carson's book \"Silent Spring\". John Muir College describes itself as the \"Heart of UCSD\" and boasts a strong and distinct character after fifty years of existence.\n\nIn addition to gender-segregated dorms and apartments, John Muir College has housing exclusively for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual (LGBTQIA+) students.\n\nJohn Muir College's general education requirements are more loosely structured than those of the other colleges, with an emphasis on \"sequences\" and individual study. Each student must complete a year-long sequence in social sciences, a sequence in natural science or math, and must choose two year-long sequences in two different areas chosen from fine arts, a foreign language or humanities. In addition, each student must complete two quarters of the \"Muir College Writing Program\" (MCWP).\n\nDue to JMC's flexible general education requirements, it is very popular among incoming students and receives the most applications each year. Consequently, it employs the most stringent admissions process among the six colleges. The flexibility of the college often encourages a large number of students to pursue multiple bachelor's degrees. Muir College's writing program incorporates college level writing over a two-quarter period, with general critical writing during the first quarter and a themed rhetorical analysis program during the second. Also unique to Muir College is the Muir Special Project major, which allows qualified students to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree by pursuing an individually designed program of interdisciplinary study.\n\nSeveral of the most notable landmarks on the UCSD campus are located at Muir College. Sun God, the colossal statue designed by late French artist Niki de Saint Phalle, stands herald over the grounds of the campus. The 8- and 11-story twin residence halls Tenaya and Tioga along with the 5- and 9-story Tuolumne and Tamarack apartment buildings stand as a testament to the nature-conserving policies of Muir as well as examples of the prevalent architectural style of the 1960s. Muir's connection to California's Yosemite Valley continues with the Half Dome Lounge and the dining hall Pines (formerly Sierra Summit). In 2012, Muir College opened Roots, the first vegan dining facility on campus that accepts student dining dollars. Muir College is also the location of Middle Of Muir, commonly known as M.O.M., a small general store unique to Muir College that stocks items specifically catered to student needs. Every Halloween, Muir students drop a giant pumpkin from the top of the tallest residence hall as part of the Halloween Carnival.\n\nIn 2007, UCSD received a $99,800 grant from the Getty Foundation to preserve Muir College's buildings, which includes significant collection of mid-century modernist architecture, designed by a team of San Diego architects led by Robert Mosher.\n\nThe MuirStock Music Festival began in April 2001 by the Muir College Council (MCC) with the aim of creating a central unifying event for the Muir community. With an initial budget of $10,000, the festival has grown exponentially and become a major, annual all-campus event. It is known as the original UCSD college music festival. The MuirStock concert always features Indie or up-and-coming artists (such as Justin Nozuka, who headlined MuirStock in 2013). MuirStock inspired MarshallPalooza and Rock 'n' Roosevelt, the music festivals for Thurgood Marshall College and Eleanor Roosevelt College. Richard Tashman, then a Muir freshman, designed the original MuirStock logo, which featured a tree growing out of a guitar.\n\n"}

Larsen and Raven had been friends since the age of five, and formed a music duo when they were eight. They released a children's album in 1996 when Larsen was 12 and Raven was 11, under the name \"Marit & Marion\". The album was nominated for a Spellemannprisen award and the band changed their name to M2M after signing a record deal with Atlantic Records in 1998. M2M were frequently praised for writing most of their songs and performing their own instruments, something which was considered to set them aside from the majority of teen pop music artists.\n\nTheir debut single, \"Don't Say You Love Me\" (1999), was both a critical and commercial success, and remained their biggest hit. Their debut album, \"Shades of Purple\" (2000), was critically acclaimed and sold over 1.5 million units worldwide. Despite critical acclaim, their second album, \"The Big Room\" (2001), did not perform as well commercially, and the duo broke up in 2002, with each pursuing a solo career. A greatest hits album, \"\" (2003), was released after they disbanded. M2M sold over 2 million albums.\n\nMarit Larsen and Marion Raven come from LÃ¸renskog in the district east of Oslo. They met at a playground when they were five and became best friends. Discovering they had similar interests in music, they began singing together. The two girls formed a music duo when they were eight, naming it \"Hubba Bubba\" after their favourite bubble gum. At the time, Raven was learning to play piano and Larsen was learning guitar. They also starred together in professional musical productions such as \"Annie\" and \"The Sound of Music\". In 1996, when Larsen was 12 and Raven was 11, they released a children's album in Norway, \"Synger Kjente Barnesanger\" (\"Sing Famous Children's Songs\"), under the name \"Marit & Marion\". The album was nominated for a Spellemannprisen award. After the record's release, they started writing their own pop songs and sent demo recordings out; one of the demos ended up at Atlantic Records and they were signed to a worldwide contract in 1998. Following being offered the contract they considered shortening their name to M&M, though decided against that after discovering there was a candy that uses that name in the United States. Instead, they held a competition for fans to come up with a name, and one girl suggested M2M.\n\nAs M2M, their first single was \"Don't Say You Love Me\" after they signed to Atlantic Records in 1998. It was featured in the closing credits of the film \"\" and was chosen as the lead single from the film's soundtrack, being released on 26 October 1999. Promoted by a \"nonstop marketing effort\", advanced airing on Radio Disney and the affiliation with PokÃ©mon, the single experienced commercial success. It charted at No. 2 in Norway and No. 4 in both Australia and New Zealand. Additionally, it was certified Gold in both Australia and America, and was nominated for the year's best song at the 2000 Spellemannprisen awards. In November 1999, M2M performed the song on the episode \"Band on the Run\" of TV series \"One World\". The duo released their debut album, \"Shades of Purple\", in early 2000. It was well received critically, and reached No. 7 in Norway, No. 89 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on Top Heatseekers chart. The second single from the album, \"Mirror Mirror\" (2000), was certified gold in the United States. A third single, \"Everything You Do\" (2000), reached No. 21 on the United States Hot Dance Singles Sales.\n\nThroughout 2000, M2M appeared on episodes of \"All That\", \"Top of the Pops\", \"Say What? Karaoke\" and MTV's \"Hot Zone\". M2M performed live at Walt Disney World's Epcot park on 12 February 2000. Their performance was recorded and appeared on an episode of Disney Channel in Concert on 29 April, which focused on both M2M and BBMak. Following the Disney recording they were scheduled to perform a series of concerts at high-schools across America; in early April 2000 they had to cancel their performance at a high-school in Arlington Heights, Illinois, as they were obligated to return to Norway to meet high-schooling commitments. In June 2000, M2M were named \"Discovery of the Year\" by the Singapore Radio Association. In September that year, they toured the United States with Hanson, performing as the bands' opening act. Despite having sold over 1 million copies of \"Shades of Purple\" and over 1.5 million singles by September 2000, M2M were still considered a risk by their investors, who at that time were only coming close to recuperating the down payment they had made to promote the duo. In early 2001 they were featured in Atlantic Records' \"Teensation\" TV concerts, which were designed to promote \"rising stars\". Concerts were filmed at Hard Rock Live in Florida and aired on Music Choice.\n\nM2M's second album \"The Big Room\", was released in Asia in late 2001 and had been released worldwide by April 2002. It was considered to have a more mature, less pop-oriented sound. The first single from the album was \"Everything\" (2001), which reached No. 6 in Norway and No. 27 in Australia. The second single, \"What You Do About Me\" (2002), was less successful, only charting at No. 46 in Australia. Another track, \"Don't\", was made available as a promotional single in the United States. While giving a positive review of the single, Chuck Taylor said it was frustrating to see the lack of chart success of M2M's singles in America, considering the duo's talent \"shines like a beacon high in the sky\". The promotion for their second album included appearing on the 100th episode of \"Dawson's Creek\". Following the appearance, they were being considered for regular roles on the then-upcoming \"Dawson's Creek\" spin-off series \"Young Americans\", and shortly thereafter they were selected as spokeswomen for the Pantene Pro-Voice concert series, a talent competition that promoted young, female songwriters in the United States. M2M were chosen as the opening act for Jewel's \"This Way\" tour, which commenced on 14 June 2002.\n\nDespite \"The Big Room\" being critically acclaimed, it was not as commercially successful as their first album, which \"Verdens Gang\" attributed to a lacklustre promotion campaign by Atlantic Records. Halfway through their tour with Jewel in mid-July, M2M were removed as the opening act by Atlantic, who cited disappointing sales of \"The Big Room\", which at that time had sold around 100,000 units in America. Shocked and disappointed by the decision, M2M returned to Norway, and ceased performing together. Raven was immediately offered a solo record contract from Atlantic, though she later withdrew from the offer.\n\nInterviewed in 2007, Larsen said that while the break-up was peaceful, \"when [they] decided it had to end, it really had to end\", adding \"we started to pull each other in different directions, because I wanted to make really good pop music and Marion wanted to go rock\". Interviewed in 2013, Raven said that she and Larsen had always agreed they would keep performing together as long as they were having a good time, and they ended because it was not fun anymore, also saying that while they had been inseparable as children, as 18-year-olds they had become quite different. A greatest hits album, \"\", was released in 2003. M2M sold over 2 million albums.\n\nBoth Larsen and Raven went on to pursue solo careers. Raven released her debut solo album \"Here I Am\" in 2005, an alternative rock album considered to be a major change from her musical style with M2M. Her debut single \"Break You\" (2005) remains her highest charting solo song, reaching No. 9 in Norway. In 2006 she featured with Meat Loaf on a cover of the song \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\", which found international success including reaching No. 1 in Norway. In 2014 she released her third studio album, \"Scandal, Vol. 1\".\n\nLarsen released her debut solo album, \"Under the Surface\", in 2006. K. Ross Hoffman from AllMusic said the album drew equally from \"folk, pop, and country\". Her fourth studio album, \"When the Morning Comes\", was released in 2014. Three of her singles have reached No. 1 in Norway, including \"If a Song Could Get Me You\" (2008), which also reached the top spot in Germany and Austria.\n\nM2M wrote many of their own songs and played their own instruments, even when performing live, which is considered rare among teen pop artists. In 1999 Ron Shapiro from Atlantic Records said \"What was extraordinary about them from the beginning was that they had an incredibly accessible pop sound and contemporary visual for what's happening today, coupled with a truly organic\nsong writing and musical instrument prowess (...) It's rare to find truly mainstream contemporary pop artists today who are also extremely skilled live performance artists and talented songwriters\". That same year Stephanie McGrath from \"AllPop.com\" said M2M's music \"breathes fresh, brusque Norwegian air into the world of pop music dominated by Britney Spears wanna-bes and Orlando-born boy bands\", noting that instead of typical teen subjects like true love or candy, M2M's songs were about \"taking things slow or not betraying your friends.\" Reviewing \"Shades of Purple\", Michael Paoletta from \"Billboard\" said the album's tracks showed a \"seasoned singing style that is, quite frankly, the antithesis of teen sensations like Britney Spears\", concluding \"Beautifully sun-kissed, \"Shades of Purple\" is poised to be the soundtrack of spring/summer 2000.\n\nM2M recorded \"The Big Room\" in just six days, saying they wanted to be like The Beatles or Simon & Garfunkel, who also recorded their albums quickly. Commenting on \"The Big Room\", Karen Tye from the \"Herald Sun\" praised M2M for using \"down-to-earth tunes and thoughtful lyrics\" instead of revealing outfits to propel them into the limelight, unlike many of their pop counterparts. M2M described their second album as \"organic pop\", as they used all real instruments in recording, while most pop albums use computerised ones.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n"}

It is a deciduous shrub growing to tall by broad with large heads of pink or blue flowers in summer and autumn. Common names include bigleaf hydrangea, French hydrangea, lacecap hydrangea, mophead hydrangea, penny mac and hortensia. It is widely cultivated in many parts of the world in many climates. It is not to be confused with \"H. aspera\" 'Macrophylla'.\n\nThe term \"macrophylla\" means large- or long-leaved. The opposite leaves can grow to in length. They are simple, membranous, orbicular to elliptic and acuminate. They are generally serrated.\n\nThe inflorescence of \"Hydrangea macrophylla\" is a corymb, with all flowers placed in a plane or hemisphere, or even a whole sphere in cultivated forms. Two distinct types of flowers can be identified: central, non-ornamental, pentamerous ones, and peripheral, ornamental, tetramerous ones. The latter are often considered as sterile, but a study of several cultivars showed that all the flowers were fertile. The four sepals of decorative flowers have colors ranging from pale pink to red fuchsia purple to blue. The non-decorative flowers have five small greenish sepals and five small petals. Flowering lasts from early summer to early winter. The fruit is a subglobose capsule.\n\n\"Hydrangea macrophylla\" is native to Japan and possibly Korea. It is reported from seaside habitats as well as mountains in Japan, from Honshu southwards. This species has naturalized in China, New Zealand and the Americas.\n\n\"Hydrangea macrophylla\" blooms can be blue, red, pink, light purple, or dark purple. The color is affected by soil pH. An acidic soil (pH below 7) will usually produce flower color closer to blue, whereas an alkaline soil (pH above 7) will produce flowers more pink.This is caused by a color change of the flower pigments in the presence of aluminium ions which can be taken up into hyperaccumulating plants.\n\nIn climates where \"Hydrangea macrophylla\" flowers, place in a mixed shrub border or at the back of a flower bed. Its rich foliage and large size make it a wonderful background for white or light colored flowers, even tall growing perennials and annuals. In warm climates \"H. macrophylla\" is good for adding a splash of early summer color to shady areas and woodland gardens. Minimal pruning is recommended for most prolific flowering. Flowers are easily air dried and are long lasting.\n\nWhile \"Hydrangea macrophylla\" is not considered a particularly difficult plant to grow, it may fail to flower. This may be due to cold winter damage to the flower buds, not getting enough sunlight, too much nitrogen fertilizer, or pruning at the wrong time of year.\n\"H. macrophylla\" forms flower buds in late summer. As a result, pruning in late summer, fall or winter could remove potential flowers. \n\nPhyllodulcin, hydrangenol, and their 8-O-glucosides, and thunberginols A and F can be found in \"H. macrophylla\". Thunberginol B, the dihydroisocoumarins thunberginol C, D and E, the dihydroisocoumarin glycosides thunberginol G 3'-O-glucoside and (â)-hydrangenol 4'-O-glucoside and four kaempferol and quercetin oligoglycosides can be found in \"Hydrangeae Dulcis Folium\", the processed leaves of \"H. macrophylla\" var. \"thunbergii\". The leaves also contain the stilbenoid hydrangeic acid.\n\nThe various colors, such as red, mauve, purple, violet and blue, in \"H. macrophylla\" are developed from one simple anthocyanin, delphinidin 3-glucoside (myrtillin), which forms complexes with metal ions called metalloanthocyanins.\n\nLunularic acid, lunularin, 3,4â²-dihydroxystilbene and a glycoside of lunularic acid have been found in the roots of \"H. macrophylla\".\n\nHydrangine is another name for the coumarin umbelliferone, and may be responsible for the possible toxicity of the plant.\n\nAmacha is a Japanese beverage made from fermented leaves of \"Hydrangea macrophylla\" var. \"thunbergii\".\n\n\"Hydrangeae Dulcis Folium\" is a drug made from the fermented and dried leaves of \"H. macrophylla var. thunbergii\" with possible antiallergic and antimicrobial properties. It also has a hepatoprotective activity by suppression of D-galactosamine-induced liver injury in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\"Hydrangea macrophylla\" is included in the Tasmanian Fire Service's list of low flammability plants, indicating that it is suitable for growing within a building protection zone.\n\nLeaf extracts of \"Hydrangea macrophylla\" are being investigated as a possible source of new chemical compounds with antimalarial activity. Hydrangeic acid from the leaves is being investigated as a possible anti-diabetic drug as it significantly lowered blood glucose, triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels in laboratory animals.\n\nThe two main types of \"H. macrophylla\" cultivars are called mophead and lacecap. Other types are in different species. \n\nSome popular hydrangea cultivars (those marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit) include: \n"}
{"id": "1927780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927780", "title": "Appenzell District", "text": "Appenzell District\n\nAppenzell District is a district of the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden in Switzerland. It has a population of (). The area of Appenzell is . The district of Appenzell consists of a part of the village Appenzell, as well as Rinkenbach, Kau and MeistersrÃ¼te.\n\nWhile a single late Bronze Age site has been discovered in the forest outside Appenzell, there is no evidence of a prehistoric settlement. The region around Appenzell remained forested and very lightly settled until the end of the Early Middle Ages.\n\nUnder the authority of the abbots of the monastery of St. Gall settlers began to colonization of the Sitter river valley in the late 11th century. It is mentioned, in a deed granting rights to clear land, in 1071 as \"Abbacella\". At the same time, the parish of St. Mauritius was established. By 1200, the parish included the area of the modern district as well as villages of Brenden, Lank, Lehn and MeistersrÃ¼te. The meager records before 1500 does not allow accurate reconstruction of the early residential development. It is likely that the first village houses were along the road between church and abbot's farm, which was built at what is now Reichsstrasse near the Gansbach stream. This gave the early village an east-west orientation. East of the church the \"MetzibrÃ¼cke\" bridge was built over the Sitter. This led to the extension of the village across the river. The eastern end of the village was a conglomerate of economic and administrative buildings.\n\nIn 1291, Appenzell was devastated by the troops of the Count of Werdenberg-Sargans.\n\nIn 1353, it was granted the market right and an open plaza, the \"SchmÃ¤uslemarkt\", opened to the south of the main street and opposite from the town hall. At the same time, a row of houses grew up to line the Hauptgasse and Hirschengasse streets. The latter road (Hirschengasse) was added as a major cross street running in the north-south direction. Additional connecting roads, squares and open areas were built at around the same time. The village of Ried, south of the village center, was founded in 1483 as a charitable foundation for poor villagers.\n\nAs the village began to grow in power it began to be mentioned as a separate entity from the rest of the \"abbatis cella\" (meaning the cell (i.e. estate) of the abbot). Starting on 10 November 1367, and often in the 15th Century, the village and court are called \"Hof\" to distinguish it from the rest of \"ze Appacelle\". The villagers of Appenzell are still known as \"Hofer\", to distinguish them from the surrounding farmers.\n\nStarting in the 14th Century, a variety of craftsmen and traders lived and worked in Appenzell. The Answer and Mandate Book of 1547 includes regulations and controls for farmers, millers and butchers. The number of fairs was increased to two on 23 September 1353 and the village was given the right to collect tolls. In the 15th century there is evidence of a tavern in Appenzell village and a set of weights and measures for regulating commercial activities.\n\nBy about 1360, conflicts over grazing rights, taxes, and tithes were causing concern for both the abbot and the farmers of Appenzell. Both parties wanted to protect their rights and interests by joining the new Swabian League. In 1377 Appenzell was allowed to join the League with the support of the cities of Konstanz and St. Gallen (the city of St. Gallen was often at odds with the neighboring Abbey of St. Gall). With the support of League, Appenzell refused to pay many of the gifts and tithes that the Abbot Kuno von Stoffeln demanded. In response to the loss of revenue from his estates, Kuno approached the Austrian House of Habsburg for help. In 1392 he made an agreement with the Habsburgs, which was renewed in 1402. In response, in 1401 Appenzell entered into an alliance with the city of St. Gallen to protect their rights and freedom.\n\nFollowing increasing conflicts between the Appenzellers the abbot's agents, including the bailiff of Appenzell demanding that a dead body be dug up because he wanted the man's clothes, the Appenzellers planned an uprising. On a certain day, throughout the abbot's lands, they attacked the bailiffs and drove them out of the land. Following unsuccessful negotiations Appenzell and St. Gallen entered into a treaty. The treaty between St. Gallen and Appenzell marked a break between the abbot and his estates. Perhaps fearing the Habsburgs, in 1402 the League expelled Appenzell. During the same year, St. Gallen reached an agreement with the abbot and Appenzell could no longer count on St. Gallen's support. Appenzell declared itself ready to stand against the abbot, and in 1403 formed an alliance with the Canton of Schwyz, a member of the Old Swiss Confederation that had defeated the Austrians in the last century. Glarus provided less support, but authorized any citizen who wished to support Appenzell to do so. In response, the League raised an army and marched to St. Gallen before heading toward Appenzell. On 15 May 1403, they entered the pass to Speicher and outside the village of VÃ¶gelinsegg met the Appenzell army. A small force of Appenzell and Confederation troops defeated the League army and signed a short lived peace treaty.\n\nFollowing another Appenzell victory on 17 June 1405, at Stoss Pass on the border of Appenzell village, the new canton continued to expand. During the expansion, Appenzell had even captured the abbot of St Gall and in response they were excommunicated by the Bishop of Constance.\n\nHowever, while the \"Bund\" expanded the Austrians used the peace to regain their strength. On September 11, 1406 an association of nobles formed a knightly order known as the \"Sankt JÃ¶rgenschild\" (Order of St. George's Shield) to oppose the rebellious commoners of the \"Bund\". Following a defeat at Bregenz, Appenzell was unable to hold the \"Bund\" together. The city of St. Gallen and the Canton of Schwyz each paid off the Austrians to avoid an attack, and the \"Bund\" was dissolved by King Rupert on April 4, 1408.\n\nAs part of the peace treaty, the abbot gave up his ownership of Appenzell, but was still owned certain taxes. However, it wasn't until 1410 that the area was at peace.\n\nIn 1411 Appenzell signed a defensive treaty with the entire Swiss Confederation (except Bern), which strengthened their position against the abbot. Appenzell joined the Confederation as an \"Associate Member\", and wouldn't become a full member until 1513. Following another battle, in 1429, Appenzell was granted freedom from the obligations in the future. This treaty represented the end of Appenzell's last financial tie to the Abbey of St. Gall, and a movement to closer relationships with the Confederation.\n\nBy no later than the end of the 1440s Appenzell provided linen to the embroidery factories of the city of St. Gallen. Later Appenzell began to establish independent foreign trade relations (1494 Venice, 1497 Constance, about 1499 Lyon, 1529 Frankfurt am Main). Starting in the last quarter of the 15th Century there was a weekly yarn and weaving market held in village. However, efforts to create an independent cloth weaving and embroidery industry in Appenzell failed repeatedly in the face of tough competition from the city of St. Gallen.\n\nOn 18 March 1560 the village was destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt mostly using the old foundations and following the pre-fire roads. The reconstruction was considered the most part of the old homesteads and foundations.\n\nFollowing the division of Appenzell into two half cantons in 1597, Appenzell village lost much of its importance as the capital.\n\nFires partially destroyed the village in 1679 and again in 1701. Most of the notable buildings, were built in the 16th Century. The parish church is from 1560â84, the ossuary in 1560-65 and the Rathaus (city hall) in 1560-83. On the southeastern edge of village, the so-called Castle was built in 1563-70 and the armory was built around 1568. The Capuchin monastery was built in 1587-88 financial statements, followed by the Capuchin nunnery in 1611-22. A comparison of historic views (from 1586, 1642 and 1839) shows that the size and structure of the village did not change between the 16th Century and the mid-19th Century.\n\nIn the 16th-18th Centuries, foreign military service played an important role in the economy of the village. Numerous families (especially the Sutter, Bischofberger, BÃ¼chler, Knusert and Ulmann) grew to dominate the foreign mercenary industry in the village.\n\nThe district was formally established in 1872 by joining the rhodes \"Lehn\" and \"Rinkenbach\".\n\nThe coat of arms shows an upright black bear with red claws on a silver background. The bear holds a red ring between its forepaws. This ring is the hamlet ring, representing the market village of Appenzell.\n\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is \"Argent a bear Sable langued, armed and priapic in his virility Gules between his front paws an Annulet of the same.\"\n\nAppenzell has an area, , of . Of this area, 66.6% is used for agricultural purposes, while 22.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 10.7% is settled (buildings or roads) and 0.7% is unproductive land.\n\nThe district (equivalent to a municipality in other cantons) is the capital of the half canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden.

{"id": "1927784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927784", "title": "Gundam Sentinel", "text": "Gundam Sentinel\n\n\"Gundam Sentinel\" took on a much more realistic, technical style of thinking and look at the \"Gundam\" universe, where mobile suits were seen more as fighter jets or military weapons. They were larger, had weapons more powerful than their predecessors', the characters were older, and the plot was on a smaller scale than what is usually found in other \"Gundam\" series. It also marked the debut of Hajime Katoki, who would become one of the franchise's most prolific mechanical designers. \"Gundam Sentinel\" is one of the most well known \"Gundam\" side stories to have been published, and is noted by Gundam fans as being one of the most mature stories in the franchise. \n\nThe series was never animated (although a short animated television commercial for a model kit was made) or released as a manga, but the mecha have been featured in various \"SD Gundam\" video games, such as \"SD Gundam G Generation F\".\n\n\"Bandai\" originally proposed to Model Graphix the idea of having the first \"non-visual\" Gundam, that is, a series totally devoid of animation production and manga as its source material. Model Graphix liked the proposal, since there was a model release vacancy between \"Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ\" and the next animated Gundam series, and it would be perfect to release their first model kit for the series, the FA-010A FAZZ.\n\nHowever, after the first few meetings, and with only part of the story and a few of the mechanical designs in place, Bandai began to lose interest in the project due to the anticipated release of \"\", and claiming that the simultaneous release of two \"Gundam\" stories would confuse fans. As a result, Bandai abandoned the project with Model Graphix, putting it on \"pending\" status. With only an alternate color version of the \"FAZZ\" model released, the fan community started to doubt the authenticity of \"Sentinel\" (due to the display of a sample model kit at the 1987 \"Japan Hobby Show\"). Bandai did not take action to defend the issue.\n\nThe then-editor of \"Newtype\" was displeased with this turn of events, and added \"Gundam Sentinel\" into its August 1987 issue, with a \"Gundam Saga II\" cover special. Six pages of a brief, detailed introduction to the story was inserted, with the words \"This is REAL!!\" added to confirm its authenticity. The six pages include detailed schematics of the titular machine, the MSA-0011 Superior Gundam, Hideaki Anno's artwork of a battle between a MSA-007 Nero and a RMS-141 Xeku Eins Type-1 mobile suit, and Hajime Katoki's design of the Superior Gundam.\n\nOnce the fan community built up the anticipation of \"Gundam Sentinel\", Bandai decided to go ahead with the serialization of Sentinel, beginning with the September issue of Model Graphix. While Model Graphix would hold the rights to the story, characters, and mobile units, Bandai would have the sole copyright of releasing its models. Wanting to hold onto their partnership, Bandai displayed all five of the sample model kits for the \"Gundam Sentinel\" line with full descriptions at the 1988 Japan Hobby Show. The Model Graphix team regarded that year's event as a \"Victory\", compared to the previous show in 1987, where only a lone Superior Gundam was displayed without any descriptions.\n\nEarth Federation Space Force (EFSF) officers stationed at the asteroid fortress Pezun rebel against the Federation leadership, which has allied with the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG). They self-claim themselves \"New Desides\" and swear to uphold the Titans' ideology of Earthnoid supremacy. The EFSF assembles Task Force Alpha, a force of EFSF, AEUG, and Karaba veterans equipped with the most advanced mobile suits, and sends them to Pezun to suppress the rebellion before it gets out of hand. The most powerful of them, the \"MSA-0011 S Gundam\", is equipped with an artificial intelligence named ALICE (Advanced Logistic and Inconsequence Cognizing Equipment).\n\nTask Force Alpha, consisting of four Salamis Kai cruisers ships and the flagship \"Pegasus III\", arrives at Pezun and prepares to attack. In the midst of the action, the rebels launch a volley of guided missiles that destroys two cruisers.\n\nA week after the encounter, the Earth Federation sends the Tenth Divisional Fleet to reinforce TF Alpha. However, fleet commander Brian Aeno - who was approached by a New Desides representative days before - announces that his force will side with the rebels. Task Force Alpha and a Federation fleet from the Moon attacks the asteroid, forcing most of the rebels to pull out and head for the city, with a small contingent on Pezun providing cover fire and wiring the base to self-destruct with a nuclear weapon. Task Force Alpha realizes the deception and escape just before the asteroid explodes.\n\nTask Force Alpha begins to probe Ayers City with units of Neros which are quickly defeated by the \"Gundam Mk. V\" piloted by New Desides leader Brave Cod. The New Desides - which finally meets Aeno's forces after they arrive - launches a powerful counterattack just as Task Force Alpha drops mobile suits into the area. They also use a logic bomb that paralyzes Alpha's mobile suits after spies crack their operating systems' software. The EFSF counters the programming, but orders a retreat because of the high casualties and sends reinforcements, designated Task Force Beta.\n\nTask Forces Alpha and Beta launch Operation Eagle Falls, an all-out assault on Ayers City. The New Desides, which wanted to use the Moon as a base to establish a new independent nation, fails to rally nearby other lunar cities to their cause. The fighting is spread out over 11 days. Cod also goes on a rampage, destroying Task Force Alpha's three-man \"FAZZ\" squad, but is killed by EFSF pilot Ryu Roots and his \"Ex-S Gundam\". As the city's forces surrender to the Federation, Ayers Mayor Kaiser Pinefield commits suicide after learning of Cod's death while the Neo Zeon arrive to extract the remaining New Desides forces.\n\nThe New Desides troops that safely escape Ayers rendezvous with the remnants of Aeno's fleet. Master strategist Tosh Cray assumes control of the group, which he formally disbands over issues on whether it should side with the Neo Zeon. He plans to hijack the relay station Penta and use it as a staging area for raiding the Federation Senate at Dakar. To boost the New Desides survivors' chances of success, the Neo Zeon supplies them with the massive \"Zod'-Iacok\" mobile armor, which is capable of atmospheric reentry and will be used to bombard the Federation base in the city.\n\nThe Pegasus III is deployed to pursue the New Desides at Penta. Arriving at the station, the Pegasus III and its remaining mobile suits confront Cray and the \"Zod'-Iacok\". The New Desides' remaining members head for Earth in three shuttles after Aeno surrenders. The \"S Gundam\" launches with Roots and pilots Shin Crypt and Tex West aboard with two \"Zeta Plus\" units in support. One Zeta Plus mobile suit is destroyed in the chase and the other, having run out of ammunition destroying one shuttle, safely enters the atmosphere. The Zod'-Iacok separates into two halves called \"Zoans\". One Zoan piloted by First Sides explodes because of an overheating mega-particle beam cannon and Josh Offshore tries to stop Roots from intercepting the second. Cray ejects from the Zoan and reboards one of the shuttles before he falls into the atmosphere.\n\nRealizing the desperate situation, ALICE, the S Gundam's AI, ejects its Core Fighter with Ryu, Crypt, and West inside. The now-self-aware mobile suit chases and destroys the New Desides survivors during the orbital descent, but breaks up under the blistering heat.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the series completed its run, Model Graphix combined all of the individual articles into a 320-page photo-novel \"mook\" format titled Gundam Wars III: Gundam Sentinel -The Battle of \"Real Gundam\"-, which also includes new material, including interviews with the design staff, mechanical profiles and detailed features on the crafting of the models. It was released in September 1989 and later saw reprints based on fan demand. In July 1990, the story was again republished as a novel titled Gundam Sentinel: Alice's Confession, featuring additional content not in previous serializations of the story. \"Gundam Wars III\" was also reprinted in 1994, but it only has articles on the model kits, shortening its size to only 216 pages.\n\nThe S Gundam and its variations were released along with the Model Graphix segments as 1/144 kits. In 2001 to 2002, Bandai released the S Gundam, EX-S Gundam, and the Xeku-Eins in its HGUC line. The FAZZ, the S Gundam, and the EX-S Gundam were released as part of the Master Grade line in September 2001, October 2002, and March 2003, respectively.\n\nIn March 2003, Hajime Katoki redesigned and released the S and EX-S Gundam in an oversized Plan 303E Deep Striker package under his Gundam Fix Figuration line of high-quality action figures. He later collaborated with Bandai to produce figures for the Robot Damashii KA Signature collection, starting with the Gundam Mark V in 2013. The line has since progressed to include a version of the Mark V in Earth Federation colors, and the MSA-007 Nero as a trainer model, Task Force Alpha unit, and the EWAC version.\n\nIn January 2018, Bandai announced the March 2018 release of the MSA-0011[Bst] S Gundam Booster Unit Type Plan 303E \"Deep Striker\" to celebrate the Master Grade line's 200th release.\n\n"}

Wombeyan Caves is a tourist attraction and local holiday area, as well as a reserve for endangered species, such as several species of wallaby, bird, possum, and wombat.\n\nIt is located within the Southern Highlands about north of Goulburn. Access is by the Wombeyan Caves Road from either Mittagong in the east or from the Goulburn-Oberon Road in the west. The caves reserve is located towards the western end of the Wombeyan Caves Road. The part of the Wombeyan Caves Road east of the reserve is very rough and has many curves and narrow stretches as it descends down to Wollondilly River and then up very rugged mountains. Some of the views are spectacular.\n\nThe area was protected as a reserve in 1865. The main site includes several camping grounds, a kiosk, a public phone, a kitchen, and other public facilities. A ranger station is also positioned near the camping site; the rangers serve to collect camping fees from visitors, prevent unsafe human-wildlife association, protect local flora and fauna, and investigate any queries or complaints.\n\nCaves found in this reserve include the Victoria Arch, one of the most popular due to its proximity to the camping grounds, and Fig Tree Cave, shown in the adjacent picture. Other caves include Junction, Wollondilly, Mulwaree and Kooringa caves. Several NSW caving groups run regular trips to Wombeyan Caves, these are official caving groups that obtain permits for various cave related expeditions.\n\nOther interesting sites are the creek, the waterfall and the various smaller caves found while traversing the extensive forest in the area.\n\nThe conservation area is a reserve for endangered species, such as several species of wallaby, bird, possum, and wombat. While strict rules are in place concerning human-wildlife interaction, local fauna are growing increasingly tame. Several species of birds, mainly magpies and Indian mynahs, often come into direct contact with people, sometimes less than a foot away, and demanding food while campers are eating. Also, the numerous kangaroo mobs are becoming increasingly trustful, and come within mere metres of campsites with no apparent trepidation. While this is much to the delight of human spectators, concerns are held for the long-term well-being of the local wildlife.\n\n"}

{"id": "1927805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927805", "title": "Elwin Ransom", "text": "Elwin Ransom\n\nElwin Ransom is the main character in the first two books of C.S. Lewis' The Space Trilogy, namely \"Out of the Silent Planet\" and \"Perelandra\". In the final book, \"That Hideous Strength\", he is a lesser character (the main characters being Mark and Jane Studdock) in charge of a group that is resisting demons that are trying to take over Earth, and playing the role of a mentor.\n\nRansom is a linguistics school professor at Cambridge, and a confirmed bachelor. According to several references in Perelandra, Ransom also served in the World War I, similarly to J.R.R. Tolkien, a good friend of C.S. Lewis. Ransom prefers to spend his holidays alone, hence his capture by the antagonists Weston and Divine. When he is captured, Ransom discovers his purpose is to serve as a 'ransom' for the entire human race allowing Weston and Devine to continue their explorations of the planet Malacandra (Mars). By \"That Hideous Strength,\" Ransom had been thoroughly changed by his experiences. Ransom's past role of imparting Bible-like occurrences is passed on to the Studdocks.\n\nMany books by C.S Lewis can be considered \"Theological Science Fiction\" or \"Christian Science Fiction\". This genre is uncommon, and depicts sci-fi stories with the basic beliefs of Christianity tied into them.\n\nSome casual references in \"Perelandra\" reveal that he had fought in the First World War, that he had been on the Somme and that on one occasion he had to overcome considerable trepidation before accepting - and successfully implementing - an unspecified \"very dangerous job\". However, it is noted that the horrors Ransom had witnessed on the battlefield did not destroy his sensitivity for suffering, even the suffering of animals.\n\nAccordingly, Ransom's birth has to be placed in 1899 or 1900 at the latest - assuming that he had fought only in 1918 (the war's last year) and had waited to legal age before signing up; if he had already been on the Somme in 1916, he must have been born in 1897 or 1898 at the latest. This fits with the mention of his being \"middle aged\" during the events of \"Perelandra\" in the 1940s. Lewis might have conceived of Ransom as being his own age, i.e., born in 1898; J.R.R. Tolkien, one of Lewis's inspirations for the character, was born in 1892.\n\nIt is also mentioned that at some later point in his life he had \"to screw up his resolution to go and see a certain man in London and make to him an excessively embarrassing confession which justice demanded\" -- which Ransom eventually did, and of which no further details are given.\n\nHe is a confirmed bachelor (as Lewis himself was at the time of writing), and in none of the three books is there any mention of a woman in his life. Nor does he have many male friends, either; when first introduced, he is in the habit of spending his university holidays hiking alone through the British countryside (which facilitates Weston's kidnapping him). By the end of the series, the wound sustained at Perelandra would preclude his continuing this habit. In the introductory chapters of \"Perelandra\", however, it is revealed that Ransom regularly provides help to a large number of neighbors and acquaintances who have fallen on hard times.\n\nHe is a philologist by profession (like Tolkien), which gives him a unique aptitude for learning languages. He speculates that this ability is the reason that he is 'chosen' for his role in the first and second books, although he notes in \"Perelandra\" that it might as well have been anyone else. \n\nA professor in Cambridge, he is highly regarded (even by his enemies, who in \"That Hideous Strength\" mention him as among the topmost in his field, who but for his Christian convictions might have rendered very useful service to their cause). \n\nAfter his sojourn on Malacandra/Mars, Ransom is mentioned as staying for a prolonged period at a cottage three miles outside \"Worchester\", having evidently left temporarily or permanently his Cambridge job. From there he sets out to his voyage to Perelandra/Venus. \n\nWhile on Venus, Ransom becomes in effect a prophet in the Biblical sense - i.e., a person to whom God speaks and on whom a specific Divine command is imposed (and who, like Jonah, strongly resists and makes a considerable effort to avoid, before bowing to the inevitable). \n\nThe permanent wound on his heel resulted from a physical battle with the demonically-possessed Professor Weston in the deep caverns of Perelandra. It causes him continuing pain which he feels it is his duty to endure, refusing to relieve it either through medicine or through Merlin's magic. \n\nThe wound may refer to Genesis 3:15, where God curses the Snake for his tempting of Eve and causing the Original Sin: \"And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.(NIV)\" The Biblical Snake is commonly considered in Christianity to have been a manifestation of Satan; so was the possessed Professor Weston. Thus, Weston could be considered an \"offspring\" of the Snake, and such he did bite the heel of Ransom and got his own head crushed. \n\nThis wound is also a possible reference to the unhealing wound of the Fisher King, the ailing Grail King of Arthurian legend, which was a major theme in some of Charles Williams' works, a significant influence to \"The Space Trilogy\": in the third book Ransom has actually taken the name of \"Fisher-King\". \n\nAt some time between the second and third book, Ransom's life was further transformed radically by becoming the secret Pendragon, the latest in an unbroken chain of secret inheritors of King Arthur who, it turns out, had been watching over Britain and helping their country in various crisis points in its history - a role which is crucially important to his relationship with the reawakened wizard Merlin. He establishes a kind of secret community at a big house in St. Anne's, which he heads and which is the polar opposite and center of opposition to the literally Satanic institute of N.I.C.E. which is threatening to take over the world. There, he is in regular contact with the descending planetary \"gods\" of the Graeco-Roman Pantheon (who are in fact not gods at all, but angels and faithful servants of the true, one and only God). \n\nThe third book, unlike the earlier two, is not told through Ransom's own eyes. He has become too much of an august and hieratic personage, seen mainly through the eyes of the book's female protagonist, who falls in love with him - hopelessly, as she realizes from the start, especially since he is a firm upholder of the sanctity of marriage and firmly wants her to be reconciled with her estranged husband. \n\nIn the end, Ransom's role as a saint or prophet is enhanced by his being taken alive into Heaven (actually, back to Venus/Perelandra), an honour reserved only to a very small handful of particularly deserving Biblical and mythical characters.\n\nAs is true with most of Lewis' writing, \"The Space Trilogy\" has religious symbolism in which Ransom takes on the role of a prophet preparing for the end times by resisting demonic forces on Earth and Perelandra. Even his last name is meant to be reminiscent of the sacrifice of Jesus.\n\nElwin Ransom may be based on C. S. Lewis' friend J. R. R. Tolkien (\"Elwin\" means \"Elf friend\" in Anglo-Saxon), though he seems to have autobiographical elements. In \"That Hideous Strength\" Ransom, with his royal charisma and matter-of-fact breezy acceptance of the supernatural, appears less like Tolkien than like Charles Williams (or some of the heroes in Williams' books).\n\nIn the final chapter of the first book, the author flatly states that \"Elwin Ransom\" is a pseudonym; however, in the second book, great significance is attached to his surname (with a divine voice saying \"It is not for nothing that you are named Ransom\"), indicating that this is in fact the character's real name. The inconsistency was never explained.\n"}
{"id": "1927812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927812", "title": "2005 German federal election", "text": "2005 German federal election\n\nFederal elections were held in Germany on 18 September 2005 to elect the members of the 16th Bundestag. This became necessary after a motion of confidence in Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der failed on 1 July. Following the defeat of SchrÃ¶der's Social Democratic Party (SPD) in a state election, SchrÃ¶der asked his supporters to abstain from the Bundestag motion, knowing the motion would fail and thus triggering an early federal election.\n\nThe opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU), started the federal election campaign with a 21% lead over the SPD in opinion polls. Many commentators expected the Christian Democrats to win a clear electoral victory and that CDU leader Angela Merkel would become Chancellor, forming a government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and displacing the governing SPD-Green coalition. However, the CDU/CSU significantly lost momentum during the campaign and ultimately won only 1% more votes and four more seats than the SPD.\n\nExit polls showed clearly that neither coalition group had won a majority of seats in the Bundestag, leading to a hung parliament situation. Both parties lost seats compared to 2002, as did the Greens, while only the Left Party (a partial successor of the Party of Democratic Socialism led by Gregor Gysi and former SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine) made significant gains. Both SchrÃ¶der and Merkel claimed victory, but the formation of a new government required careful negotiations. On 10 October 2005, officials from the SPD and the CDU/CSU indicated that negotiations between the two had concluded successfully and that the participating parties would form a grand coalition with Angela Merkel as Chancellor. When the Bundestag met on 22 November, 397 CDU/CSU and SPD Bundestag members duly voted for Merkel.\n\nChancellor SchrÃ¶der orchestrated the loss of the Bundestag motion of confidence with the aim of triggering an early federal election following the defeat of his SPD in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia on 22 May 2005. The victory of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia gave that party, together with the FDP, a working majority in the Bundesrat, the federal legislature's upper house.\n\nEarly federal elections in Germany can only take place after the dissolution of the Bundestag by the President of Germany, since the constitution forbids the Bundestag to dissolve itself. The President can dissolve it only after the Chancellor loses a vote on a motion of confidence. The Federal Constitutional Court had ruled in 1983 in similar circumstance that Chancellors could not approach the President seeking the dissolution of the Bundestag if this was merely for the purposes of prompting an early election; it should only be possible in circumstances where there was difficulty passing legislation. Many observers agree that SchrÃ¶der met this requirement, since a number of left-wing SPD delegates had expressed great reservations concerning Chancellor SchrÃ¶der's labour reform and welfare reform programme. However, only days before the vote, the coalition had passed a number of bills with no dissenters, indicating strong support for the Chancellor within the coalition. After urging his own members to abstain on the vote, Chancellor SchrÃ¶der purposely lost a vote of confidence in the Bundestag on 1 July by 296 to 151. On 21 July President Horst KÃ¶hler dissolved the Bundestag and paved the way for the early election on 18 September.\n\nThe Green member of parliament Werner Schulz â who, in a much-cited speech on the day of the motion of confidence, had criticised the deliberate loss of the motion as \"farcical\" and likened the Bundestag's obedience to SchrÃ¶der to behaviour typical of the German Democratic Republic Volkskammer â and the SPD member of parliament Jelena Hoffmann jointly filed a constitutional complaint in the Federal Constitutional Court. The Court rejected the complaint on 25 August, ruling as valid the President's decision to dissolve the Bundestag, thereby giving the green light for the early elections on 18 September and ending speculation that SchrÃ¶der would have to step down or lead a \"lame duck\" government.\n\nA small number of members of minor political parties filed similar complaints: the Court similarly rejected them during the week before the election.\n\n\nThe CDU/CSU nominated Angela Merkel for Chancellor, the first time in German history that one of the two larger parties had nominated a woman for this position. The CDU presented a platform involving increasing the pace and scope of economic deregulation in Germany and pursuing cuts in income tax and public spending (many commentators have compared Merkel with Margaret Thatcher). The CDU began the campaign with a 21% lead over the SPD and confidence in Merkel's victory led the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, to meet with her ahead of Chancellor SchrÃ¶der during a visit to Berlin in June.\n\nThe SPD had the goal of maintaining the current deregulation agenda. They added to their election program some minor corrections such as broadening the financing base of the healthcare system and the proposal of a 3% additional tax for people with annual incomes above 250,000 euro (after the governing coalition earlier in 2005 cut the highest income tax rate from 48.5% to 42%).\n\nThe Greens decided on their program in July 2005. Compared to their previous federal election program, they increased the emphasis on economics and labour-market politics. For the first time this topic came before the classical green topic of environmental politics in the program. In general, the program moved slightly to the left; including stating the necessity for changes to some existing red-green governmental policies.\n\nThe FDP announced its election program before any other party, publishing it on 24 July. It called for strong saving measures in public spending and more room for local negotiation between employees and employers, as opposed to central control by trade-union officials.\n\nThe leaders of the left wing Party of Democratic Socialism (the \"PDS\") agreed to let candidates of the centre left Electoral Alternative for Labor and Social Justice (the \"WASG\") run on their party list, leaving open the possible future option of a merger between the two parties. In agreeing to this the WASG stipulated that the PDS rename itself as the Left Party. The WASG, with its front-runner Oskar Lafontaine (a former SPD leader), formed from breakaway elements within the SPD, angered at that party taking a \"neoliberal\" direction in economic reforms. The general membership has already approved this measure and awaits to hear from the PDS party convention to agree as well. If successful this could lead to a further erosion of the SPD's strength, as the PDS has never made inroads in the former West Germany (it lineally succeeded the former governing communist party (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) of the former German Democratic Republic), while the WASG has its base in western Germany and could garner substantial votes there.\n\nTwo of Germany's small far-right parties, the National Democratic Party (NPD) and the German People's Union (DVU), announced that they would run on a common platform in this election, raising fears in the mainstream German political establishment that together they might succeed in gaining more than 5% of the national vote and thus in entering the Bundestag. Since German electoral law does not permit common lists of two or more parties, in practice the DVU did not enter the election, and members of that party appeared on the NPD list.\n\nEarly election polls during summer 2005 from 6 organizations showed a solid lead for the CDU/CSU with a share of the vote ranging between 41% and 43%, and the SPD trailing at between 32% and 34%. The polls further showed the FDP, a possible coalition partner for the conservatives, at between 6.5% and 8%, and the Greens, the current coalition partner for the SPD, between 6% and 8%. Most polls indicated a likely majority for a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition. As for other parties, those polls which explicitly included the PDS-WASG electoral alliance showed it above the 5% hurdle at between 7% and 8.5%. No poll showed any other parties, including far-right parties, near 5%, although far-right parties have in the past sometimes polled below their actual support due to unwillingness by voters to admit their support.\n\nIn early August support for Angela Merkel declined considerably. Reasons for this included conflicts about the election program in and between the conservative parties (the CDU and the CSU), and arguments with their preferred coalition partner, the FDP, as well as embarrassing gaffes. At one point the media criticized Merkel for confusing net and gross income figures during a campaign speech. Following this, polls suggested that the CDU/CSU and FDP would only win 48% of votes between them, and thus would not be able to form a government. Further damage occurred when two prominent CDU/CSU candidates, JÃ¶rg SchÃ¶nbohm and the CSU leader Edmund Stoiber, made insulting remarks about East Germans. These remarks not only alienated voters in Eastern Germany but also made some question the CDU/CSU's confidence in Merkel, as she herself grew up in the East.\n\nHowever, polls carried out by the \"SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung\" in late August showed the CDU/CSU/FDP bloc back up at 51% of the vote. Predictions suggested that the opposing bloc of incumbent Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der's ruling Social Democrats, the Greens and the country's recently formed left-wing Left Party (PDS/WASG alliance) would win a combined total of only 46%. The leaders of the SPD and the Greens, SchrÃ¶der and Fischer, as well as the Left Party's front-runner Gregor Gysi said they opposed the idea of a \"red-red-green\" coalition. With polls remaining so close, speculation increased that (as in the elections of 1994, 1998 and 2002) a small number of overhang seats might significantly impact the election results.\n\nOn Sunday 4 September, SchrÃ¶der and Merkel met in a head-to-head debate which was broadcast by four of Germany's major private and public television networks. Although most commentators gave the initial edge to Merkel, polls soon showed that the general public disagreed and ranked SchrÃ¶der the clear winner. Later analysis suggested that Merkel's support for a flat-tax proposal by Paul Kirchhof, the shadow Finance Minister, further undermined her credibility on economic affairs and gave the impression that the CDU's economic reforms would only benefit the very rich.\n\nMidweek polls showed the SPD clawing their way upwards by a few percentage points although the combined CDU/CSU and FDP votes tended to remain 1 to 2 percentage points ahead of those for the left-wing parties combined. On the eve of the election, the CDU enjoyed a 9% lead over the SPD (42% and 33% respectively), albeit with neither party likely to have enough seats (even with their preferred coalition partners) to form a government. Merkel's personal popularity (consistently below that of her party) had climbed back up to 40%, from a low of 30% while SchrÃ¶der's had reached a peak of 53% (consistently exceeding that of his party). However, polls also showed that even at this late stage, a quarter of German voters had not yet decided how to vote and that these undecided voters could decide the final result if they turned out to vote. With polls still so close, the parties broke with tradition and continued campaigning on the Saturday before the election and on election day itself. While pundits focused on the likelihood of a grand coalition, the CDU suggested that the SPD might consent to forming a coalition with the new Left Party.\n\nGermany went to the polls on 18 September 2005. Voters in one constituency in Dresden had to wait until 2 October to vote in order to allow the reprinting of ballot-papers after the death of the National Democratic Party candidate on 8 September.\n\nSoon after voting ended, it became clear that the CDU/CSU (the \"Union\") had narrowly edged out the SPD. However, neither of the two likely coalitions (SPD-Greens and CDU/CSU-FDP) could achieve a \"Kanzlermehrheit\" â the support of the majority of members of the Bundestag required to elect a Chancellor. This meant that Germany had a hung parliament as no coalition could hold an overall parliamentary majority. Exit polls for both the ARD and the ZDF television networks showed the CDU/CSU on 35%, the SPD on 34%, the FDP on 10%, the Left Party on 9% and the Greens on 8%; a Forsa poll differed slightly, predicting 36% for the CDU/CSU and 8% for the Left Party. Early seat projections suggested that the CDU/CSU and the SPD had virtually tied in the count for seats in the Bundestag. The exit polls and projections proved broadly accurate in the preliminary results released on 19 September and in the final results published on 7 October.\n\nThe SPD/Green coalition's number of seats fell from 306 seats (in a house of 603), to 273 seats (in a house of 614) while the opposition, the CDU/CSU-FDP coalition's number of seats fell from 295 seats to 286 seats. Both potential coalitions fell far short of the 308 seats required for a majority in this Bundestag. The Left Party and the FDP overtook the Greens, previously Germany's third most-popular party since 1994. The FDP, with almost 10% of the vote, scored its best result since the 1990 federal election, regaining its status as the Federal Republic's third party, which it had enjoyed throughout the history of West Germany and maintained in the first post-German reunification election. Some analysts believe that the rise in the FDP vote came as a result of tactical voting by CDU-CSU voters hoping to prevent a grand coalition by buttressing the Free Democrats. Of the parties that failed to secure the 5% needed to attain seats in the Bundestag, the National Democratic Party performed best, winning 1.6% of the list vote and 1.8% of the constituency vote.\n\nSecond Vote (\"Zweitstimme\", or votes for party list)\n\nBoth Angela Merkel (CDU) and Gerhard SchrÃ¶der (SPD) claimed victory and the Chancellorship as the exit polls came in. It soon became clear that neither could form a majority government within the existing coalitions. Largely because of strong hostility between SchrÃ¶der and Oskar Lafontaine, a former SPD chairman turned leader of the Left Party, the obvious left-wing coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left Party was not possible. However, both the CDU and SPD said that they would negotiate with all parties that had won seats except the Left Party, while the leaders of the Left Party rejected any possibility of participating in a coalition with either of the two main parties. The exclusion of the Left Party reduced the possible coalitions to the following three arrangements:\n\n\nDespite some prominent members publicly blaming Merkel for its poor showing, the CDU/CSU confirmed her as leader on 20 September. On 22 September, SPD members began musing that the political system should consider the CDU and the CSU as separate entities rather than as a single parliamentary faction. In such a scenario, the SPD would be the largest party in the Bundestag and thus, they argued, an SPD member should become Chancellor in any grand coalition. One SPD legislator indicated he planned to introduce a motion in the Bundestag explicitly defining the CDU and the CSU as separate parties. The Greens rejected coalition with the CDU/CSU after talks broke down. The CDU/CSU pressed their case for the Chancellery after victory in the delayed vote in Dresden, and ahead of talks with the SPD; the SPD maintained their own claim, but SchrÃ¶der indicated that he would step aside if his party wished it.\n\nFinally, on 10 October, officials from the CDU/CSU and the SPD announced that negotiations to form a grand coalition had succeeded. Angela Merkel would become Chancellor and the sixteen seats in the new cabinet (including the Chancellery) would go equally to each side, with the CDU/CSU and the SPD each having eight posts. The SPD would control eight ministries including the important roles of finance and foreign affairs, while the CDU/CSU would control six ministries as well as providing the Chancellor and the Director of the Federal Chancellery (the Chancellor's Chief of Staff), who would also hold the position of Minister for Special Affairs. Gerhard SchrÃ¶der would retire from politics.\n\nDetailed negotiations on the formation of the new government continued into November, with Edmund Stoiber of the CSU withdrawing from the proposed cabinet to continue as Minister-president of Bavaria. All three parties held conferences on 14 November which voted to approve the deal. The majority of CDU/CSU and SPD delegates in the newly assembled Bundestag elected Merkel as Chancellor on 22 November. 397 members of the Bundestag voted for Merkel, indicating that 51 members from one or more of the SPD, CDU or CSU do not support the coalition deal.\nReports have indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which directly contradict aspects of Merkel's political platform as a former leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition intended to cut public spending while increasing VAT, social-insurance contributions and the top rate of income tax. Employment protection would no longer cover employees during their first two years in a job, and the new government intended to freeze pensions and to scrap subsidies for first-time home buyers. In the field of foreign policy, Germany would maintain its strong ties with France and with Poland, and will continue its support for Turkey as a future member of the European Union. Merkel has defined the main aim of her government as reducing unemployment, and expressed the hope that posterity will judge the success of her tenure on the basis of this issue.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It sits next to the Oak Island Coast Guard Station on the east end of Oak Island in Brunswick County looking south out at the Atlantic Ocean. Featuring four 2.5 million candlepower aerobeacon lenses which produce four, one-second bursts of light every 10 seconds, it has a luminous range of 24 nautical miles. Owned by the town since 2004, it is managed by a citizens group (Friends of Oak Island Lighthouse). \nIn May 1958, the Oak Island Lighthouse replaced the Cape Fear Light, a steel skeleton structure on Bald Head Island which was demolished that same year. The Cape Fear Light began operation in 1903 and was then a functional replacement for the still standing and now popular tourist attraction, the 1817 Bald Head Light (Old Baldy). During the period 1958â1962, the Oak Island Light was the brightest in the US (the Charleston Light in South Carolina now holds that distinction).\n\nBuilt in 1957-58 by Brinkley, W.F. & Son Construction Co. located in Granite Quarry NC at a cost of $110,000, it was one of the last lighthouses constructed in the US. It rests on 24 pilings driven 67' deep to bedrock which are 10\" round, filled with concrete and capped by a 30' wide by 3' deep octagonal concrete base. As for the structure itself, 142' of it is poured concrete, the top 52' of which is black, the middle 50' white, and the bottom 40' feet cement grey. The black and white colors are not painted on the structure, having instead been mixed into the concrete at the time the tower was constructed. On top of all of this sits an 11' tall aluminum and glass light enclosure. The inside of the tower has a uniform diameter of a little more than 16' 4\", with the exterior concrete walls 8\" thick. While the overall structure is 153' tall, it was sited on a small knoll, which has nautical charts showing the light as being 169' above sea level. \n\nThe Oak Island Lighthouse grounds are open to the public year-round for viewing and picture taking, with 30 minute parking provided at the base of the tower from sunrise until sunset. A walkway to the beach provides a good vantage point for photos of the structure, and descriptive placards along the way describe the site history and resident wildlife/vegetation. The structure itself and the walkway are cared for and managed by a citizens group, Friends of Oak Island Lighthouse (FOIL). \nThe interior of the lighthouse is open for visits by the general public, aged seven or above, with tours to the second level (up twelve steps) from Memorial DayâLabor Day on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. Tours to the top of the lighthouse, which has an outside balcony, are offered year round (except for a few major holidays) for those aged nine or older. It requires climbing 131 steps, which unlike the classic circular pattern, have straight but very steep sections with eight landings along the way, a style referred to as a 'ships ladder.' A minimum of two weeks (four weeks in the summer months) advance notice is normally required for such a tour reservation, which can be obtained on-line by visiting the FOIL web site. \n\n"}

{"id": "1927833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927833", "title": "Video lottery terminal", "text": "Video lottery terminal\n\nA video lottery terminal (VLT), also sometimes known as a video gaming terminal, video slots, or the video lottery, is a type of electronic gambling machine. They are typically operated by a region's lottery, and situated at licensed establishments such as bars and restaurants.\n\nVLTs typically feature a selection of multiple games, primarily video slot machines and Keno. Their exact operation depends on local law: many VLTs are stand-alone devices containing a random number generator. Each terminal is connected to a centralized computer system that allows the lottery jurisdiction to monitor gameplay and collect its share of revenue. The outcome of each wager on a VLT is random. VLT operators are not able to program the total amount wagered, or payouts, through the central computer system. A minimum percentage payout usually is written into that jurisdiction's law. That percentage is realized not by manipulation of the game, but by adjusting the expected overall payout.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, VLTs do not contain a random number generator, and display results from a fixed pool controlled by the central system (in similar fashion to scratch-off lottery tickets).\n\nVLT programs are operated in eight Canadian provinces, with the only major exceptions being British Columbia and Ontario. These machines are typically governed by the region's lottery and gaming boards, and are situated inside licensed establishments such as bars. In several provinces, VLTs were deployed primarily to help counter illegal underground video gambling operations, while several (particularly those whose economies are reliant on natural resources) cited economic development as a factor in their use.\n\nVLTs were first popularized in Atlantic Canada, with New Brunswick becoming the first province to introduce them in 1990, and the other Atlantic provinces following suit in 1991. In New Brunswick, sites were initially limited to a maximum of five machines each, and they were later removed from locations that did not hold liquor licenses. Since 2002, the Atlantic Lottery Corporation has been fully responsible for all VLT operations in the province, rather than having their costs covered by private owner-operators. The ALC had already operated the VLT programs in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia since their launch, while Prince Edward Island transferred its VLTs to the ALC in 2003. Quebec introduced VLTs in 1994.\n\nVLTs also began to appear in Western Canada in 1991, with Alberta trialling them during the Calgary Stampede and Klondike Days events before beginning a province-wide program the following year. Manitoba initially deployed them at rural locations only, but expanded them to Winnipeg in 1993, and the Assiniboia Downs race track. Saskatchewan introduced VLTs in 1993, primarily to encourage business at establishments in smaller communities (which faced competition from out-of-province casinos, prior to the opening of several commercial and First Nations casinos in the province). Saskatchewan's VLT program also includes games offering regional and province-wide progressive jackpots.\n\nTo address problem gambling concerns, VLTs in Canada are typically equipped with features and restrictions as safeguards in comparison to a casino-style slot machine, including the display of a player's credits as a cash value rather than units of a denomination, on-screen display of the current time, maximum session lengths with mandatory cash-out after time expires, limits on hours of operation, no Stop button (to regulate the pace of play), wager limits, limits on the amount of cash that can be deposited during a single session, and problem gambling resources. Some VLTs may also offer integrated account systems for tracking usage and setting limits on cash spent. In 2012, Nova Scotia began to mandate that users enroll in an account card system known as My-Play in order to use VLTs. The government discontinued the scheme in 2014, citing its decision to allow players to register anonymously without personal information (\"light\" enrollment) as having defeated the purpose of the systemâas many players only used the cards temporarily before disposing them. The government claimed it would save $200,000 a year by removing the system.\n\nEach province has imposed caps on the number of VLTs that may operate in their province, and Nova Scotia has enforced a moratorium on new VLT sites and attrition on existing sites outside of First Nations reservations (taking VLTs out of service permanently if a site closes or removes them). In the 2000s, Alberta reallocated some of its VLTs to increase the number allowed at specific sites, in effect reducing the total number of sites in operation. Some provinces also have regulations that allow individual municipalities to hold referendums to opt out of VLT operation in their communities. In January 2017, Quebec announced that it would similarly re-allocate and cut its VLTs from 12,000 to under 10,000 over the next two years, including making the number of sites and machines present in a region proportional to population, and focus more on placing them in leisure venues such as billiard halls and bowling alleys to \"promote socialization and group entertainment\".\n\nThe Moncton, New Brunswick-based Spielo has been heavily involved in the VLT market; it was acquired in 2004 by GTECH Corporation, which was in turn acquired by Lottomatica of Italy, which then acquired and merged with IGT in 2015. Alberta and the Atlantic Lottery both deployed modernizations to their VLT networks in the early-2010s, entering into supply deals with multiple gaming vendors, collectively including Aristocrat, and the present IGT (IGT, Spielo) and Scientific Games (Bally Technologies and WMS).\n\nLotteries in the U.S. were considering VLTs as early as 1981, when a planned experiment with 20 machines by the New York State Lottery was scrapped, after the Attorney General determined they would be illegal. A similar plan by the New Jersey Lottery died in 1983 after ties between state officials and VLT manufacturers raised conflict of interest concerns.\n\nThe first VLTs in the country were installed in late 1983 by Bellevue, Nebraska as part of its municipal lottery. Eleven other local lotteries in Nebraska followed suit, until the state banned the devices, effective 1985.\n\nSouth Dakota became on October 16, 1989, the first state to adopt VLTs. In a unique arrangement with private industry, the machines are owned by private companies but monitored by the South Dakota Lottery via a centralized computer system that assures the integrity of the games. South Dakota imposes a substantial tax on the net income (gross income minus player winnings) of the games. Beginning in 1992, four attempts were made to repeal South Dakota's video lottery; all were widely rejected by public votes. Most recently, in May 2006, petitions were filed containing over 21,000 signatures in order to place the issue on the November ballot; voters again agreed to keep video lottery, by a 66%-34% margin.\n\nOther US jurisdictions which have had legal video lottery include Oregon, South Carolina (formerly), Rhode Island, Delaware, New York, Ohio, West Virginia, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana and Illinois. Of these, Delaware, Rhode Island, and West Virginia formerly participated in a shared VLT game, Cashola.\n\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands also has a legalized video lottery, managed by Southland Gaming of the Virgin Islands. The local governments in St. Thomas and St. John use the funds generated by the video lottery to fund various government programs on the islands; primarily focusing on educational efforts.\n\nIn 1990, West Virginia introduced the concept of racinos when it allowed MTR Gaming Group to add VLTs to Mountaineer Race Track & Gaming Resort in Chester.\n\nRacinos differ from traditional VLTs in that all video lottery games are played on a gaming machine.\n\nOther states that have legalized VLTs in racinos are Delaware, Rhode Island, Louisiana, New York, Ohio, and West Virginia.\n\nIn Montana, VLT-type poker, keno and bingo machines are legal to operate in the private sector. Since the 1970s, Montana was the first state, other than Nevada and New Jersey, to legalize machine gaming.\n\nKeno and Bingo machines were first introduced in Montana in 1975. Although subject to legal challenge, these machines were deemed legal in 1976 after the Montana Supreme Court ruled in favor of Treasure State Games, a private company that brought the first games of this type to the state. (See Justia.com - Treasure State Games v. State of Montana)\n\nUnlike in other states, the gaming devices are not under the jurisdiction of the state lottery. In 2011 the state legislature added another class of games, so-called \"line games\", to the list of approved games.\n\nAll establishments licensed for the on-premises consumption of alcohol within the state of Montana are allowed to operate such machines provided they have the correct permits. In addition, there are some Montana establishments (such as some truck stops) that do not possess \"on-sale\" licenses but hold \"grandfather\" licenses allowing them to operate gaming machines.\n\nThe maximum prize awarded on these machines is $800, with a maximum bet of $2 per hand. The legal age to gamble in Montana is 18, although people under the age of 21 cannot gamble in bars.\n\nAs in Louisiana, the games in Montana are not technically part of its lottery.\n\nCurrently, only Oregon and South Dakota employ Class III gaming technology (incorporating a random number generator) into their VLT games. Oregon's VLT program was modeled upon those deployed in Canada. The devices operated in Montana are also Class III machines, but as they are not connected to the Montana Lottery are technically not \"video \"lottery\" terminals\". This means that unlike any of the Class II states (which have a fixed number of winners, analogous to scratch cards), Oregon and South Dakota lottery players compete against a house edge rather than other lottery players. This is the same type of gaming offered in Nevada, Connecticut and Atlantic City, New Jersey as well as in the majority of tribal casinos. Currently, the state of Oregon offers its players a 91-95% payout on each of its games. South Dakota and Montana law specifies that payouts must be greater than 80%, although in reality actual payouts in these two jurisdictions are around 88-92%.\n\nMost US jurisdictions do not allow VLTs and those that do have attracted the same criticism the Canadian provinces have. However, some non-players have expressed tolerance for the machines.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions, VLTs are known as \"video gaming devices (VGD)\" or \"video slot machines\" along with \"Video Gaming Terminal (VGT)\". Most VLTs are multi-game devices, allowing the players to select, from an on-screen menu, the game(s) they wish to play. They are also known as \"poker machines\" and \"fruit machines\" in some areas.\n\n\n"}

It is \"one of the oldest breeds in the Iberian Peninsula.\"\n\nThe Estrela Mountain Dog comes in two coat types. Both types should have coat resembling the texture of goat hair.\n\nLong coat: The thick, slightly coarse outer coat lies close over the body and may be flat or slightly waved, but never curly. Undercoat is very dense and normally lighter in color than the outer coat. The hair on the front sides of the legs and the head is short and smooth. Hair on the ears diminishes in length from the base of the ears to the tips. The hair on the neck, the buttocks, the tail, and the back side of the legs is longer resulting in a ruff at the neck, breeches on the buttocks and backs of the legs, and feathering on the tail. The males can have a \"lion's mane\".\n\nShort coat: The outer coat is short, thick, and slightly coarse, with a shorter dense undercoat. Any feathering should be in proportion.\n\nFawn, wolf gray and yellow, with or without brindling, white markings or shadings of black throughout the coat. All colors have a dark facial mask, preferably black. Blue coloration is very undesirable.\n\nDesirable height for mature males is 25Â½ - 28Â½ inches and for mature females is 24Â½ - 27 inches. Mature males in good working condition weigh between 88 and 110 pounds. Mature females in good working condition weigh between 66 and 88 pounds.\n\nA large, athletic dog, the Estrela Mountain Dog is a formidable opponent for any predator. It is calm but fearless and will not hesitate to react to danger, making it an exceptional watchdog as well as an excellent guard dog. It is intelligent, loyal, and faithful, affectionate to those it knows but wary of those it does not. It is instinctively protective of any children in its family. It needs early and continued socialization to be trustworthy around small pets and other dogs.\n\nIt's important to begin training and socializing the Serra da Estrela dog from puppyhood to nurture its acceptance of different situations. This is a strong independent-minded breed that will need persistent training and consistent leadership. It has a tendency to bark, especially when protecting his or her territory. As with most livestock guardians, the Serra da Estrela dog is not a pet for everyone. Strong ownership is paramount.\n\nThe breed has been developed in the mountains of Serra da Estrela, in what is now Portugal. The Estrela Mountain Dog is one of the oldest breeds in Portugal. The earliest of the Estrela ancestors were herd-guarding dogs in the Serra da Estrela, in what is now Portugal. There are no written record of their history. \n\nLife changed little for the people and dogs of the region, even into the 20th century. The isolation of the region meant the breed was relatively unknown outside it until the early 1900s, and even then, they were mostly ignored in early dog shows. The Portuguese admired foreign breeds much more than their own. Shepherds often castrated their dogs to prevent them from leaving their flocks to mate. These factors had a negative effect on the Estrela. So from 1908 to 1919, special shows called concursos were held to promote and preserve the Estrela breed in the region. During this period there was some attempt at a registry (of which there is no surviving record). Special livestock guardian working trials were included in these shows. The trial consisted of an owner/shepherd bringing his dog into a large field with many flocks of sheep. The dog was observed by judges for its reactions coming into the field and as the shepherd was ordered to move the flock, which inevitably produced stragglers. The dog was expected to move from his spot of guarding to bring the stragglers back, and then assume a leadership position at the head of the flock.\n\nThe first, tentative, recorded breed standard was published in 1922. This standard only reflected the functional features naturally found in the best dogs of the time, although it did mention having dew claws as reflecting a âperfectâ dog. The characteristic hooked tail and turned-back (rosed) ears, which later became part of the official standard, were not mentioned in this preliminary standard.\n\nThe first official breed standard was written in 1933. This standard attempted to differentiate the Estrela as a distinct breed. This led to the hooked tail and double dew claws becoming a requirement. All colors were allowed. The standard has undergone small refinements since then. For example, dew claws became optional by 1955, and the allowed colors have been limited a few times to achieve today's current set.Prior to World War II, the Estrela breeders were still primarily the shepherds and farmers of the region. Since they were mostly illiterate, they did not make any attempt to follow the official breed standard, if they even knew one existed. But by the early 1950s, interest in the breed returned, and the annual concursos were reinstated. Again the intent was to stimulate interest among the Serra residents and to encourage them to adhere to the official standard. During this period, the long-haired variety was most popular at shows, but âshow dogsâ represented (and still do) only a small portion of the Estrela population in Portugal. Many of the working dogs were (and are) short-haired.\n\nEarly in the 1970s, interest was steeply declining. There was some concern about the degeneration and even possible extinction of the breed. But the Portuguese revolution of 1974 helped save the Estrela. It led to changes both in dog shows in Portugal and in Portuguese dog breeds. Prior to the revolution, dog showing had largely been a pastime of the wealthy, with their preference for non-Portuguese breeds as status symbols. Now, working people could and did show the native dogs they preferred. Also, with the revolution came an increase in crime and thus more interest in guard dogs.\n\nThere is no record of the Estrela outside Portugal prior to 1972. While some undoubtedly did leave the country, they were probably interbred, with no effort to maintain the breed. In 1972 and 1973, pairs were imported to the US. Others were probably imported into the US since then, but it was not until 1998 that the first papered dog was imported into the United States. The United Kingdom was the first country to establish the breed outside Portugal in 1972. Today the Estrela can be found in many countries.\n\nToday, the Estrela Mountain Dog remains true to its guardian heritage. It is still a working dog, guarding flocks in its native Portugal and elsewhere (the Portuguese Marines had even used them as patrol dogs). It is also an ideal family pet because of its alertness, loyalty, intelligence, and its instinct to nurture young; all features it needed in its earliest days.\n\n"}
{"id": "1927845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927845", "title": "Duck Reach Power Station", "text": "Duck Reach Power Station\n\nDuck Reach Power Station was the first publicly owned hydro-electric plant in the Southern Hemisphere, and provided the Tasmanian city of Launceston with hydro-electric power from its construction in 1895 to its closure in 1955.\n\nThe site was picked by Launceston city surveyor and engineer Charles St John David in 1892.\n\nThe penstock ran diagonally down the hill into the centre of the rear of the power station where it channeled in to successively smaller pipes and finally to eight Siemens turbines.\n\nThe tunnel was drilled to a length of at a 1 to 110 grade. The tunnel was cut through the hill side instead of being piped around and it took 16Â months to complete using pneumatic drills. Dolerite is so hard it took one week of eighteen 8-hour shifts cutting from both ends of the tunnel to cut just however the average speed of the drilling was about a week.\nTwo men were killed in accidents. When both ends met it was found that the accuracy was within 1 inch.\n\nThe Duck Reach Power Station first operated on a trial basis on the evening of the 10th of December 1895, when it was used to illuminate some of Launceston's streets using arc lights. On the 1st of February 1896, the hydro-electric power system was officially switched on, remaining in operation until 1955.\n\nThe following is paraphrased from the display plaques now within the power station:\n\nOriginally the installation had a capacity of 75Â kW DC, provided by five 15Â kW dynamos, and 360Â kW AC, provided by three 120Â kW alternators. The turbines were manufactured by Gilbert Gilkes and Co., whilst the dynamos and alternators were built by Siemens and Co.. All alternating-current (AC) supply was single-phase. By 1906 demand had risen and it became necessary to upgrade the plant. This was done by removing much of the original equipment and replacing it with four 445Â hp Francis turbines manufactured by Kolben and Co. of Prague, each coupled to a single 300Â kW three-phase alternator again built by Siemens and Co.. This raised the AC capacity of the station to 1.2Â MW. The original DC equipment remained in use.\n\nAgain by 1926, this had become inadequate, and to ease the problem a new turbine coupled to an 800Â kW alternator was added alongside the existing machinery. To drive this new turbine a timber flume and a masonry aqueduct was constructed, running from Deadmans Hollow around the bend in the South Esk River to the slope immediately behind the Power Station, where it was led into a new steel penstock running alongside the original one. The addition of this new turbine and alternator raised the capacity of the station to . In the photograph above, the left-hand penstock is the newer one.\n\nOne of the original Siemens and Co. 15Â kW DC dynamos, dating from 1895, is preserved and on display within the station.\n\nThe power station was closed in 1955, following the construction of the Trevallyn Dam and power station.\n\nThe suggestion to create a museum at Duck Reach was first mooted in December 1956 in a letter to the editor of Examiner by Mr Michael Shari and of Hobart. In his letter of 17 December 1956 he suggested that the Duck Reach Power Station, with state backing of the Launceston City Council, be established as a technological museum. Mr Sharland at that time was Secretary of the Scenery Preservation Board and an authority on early Tasmanian buildings.\n\nThe Mayor of Launceston, Alderman Edwards, supported the idea saying that only a little money would be needed to convert the station. At that time the station was kept in good order by three men even though the station had been closed for some time. In fact one of the six generators was kept in good order to light the building and office.\n\nLater that month, in another letter Mr A.R. Evershed of Launceston endorsed Mr Sharlandâs letter stating that âprobably the original plant was the first, or one of the first high tension alternating current hydroelectric plants for long transmission in the worldâ and that âit would certainly be a crime to destroy such interesting historical matterâ.\n\nIn late March 1957 the state Hydro Electric Commission offered the station to the Launceston City Council stating that âif it is left unattended it will soon deteriorate and Launceston will lose a unique beauty spot which attracts thousands of people each yearâ. The Scenery Preservation Board at the time was prepared to donate old machinery for exhibits.\n\nThe Director of the Queen Victoria Museum was asked by the council to report on the matter. The Director of the museum recommended to council to decline the offer saying that âsomehow I canât help but feel that it is a little unfair to suggest that the council would be to blame if these buildings and bridge were demolished. After all the Hydro owns them and has used them and surely it is the responsibility of the Hydro Electric Commission or the Scenery Preservation Board to preserve these government assetsâ. It seems he was very unenthusiastic.\n\nSome twenty years later the âLaunceston National Conservation Studyâ suggested that the building could be used as a museum of industrial archaeology related to its history.\n\nIn the study âConservation in Practiceâ by Lionel Morrell 1979, it is suggested that the building be used as a tourist attraction or restaurant.\n\nIn the âRiveredge Studyâ by Donald Goldsworthy 1980, it is suggested that:\n\na) the power station be rehabilitated\n\nb) the suspension bridge be reconstructed\n\nc) the stone cottages be re-evaluated\n\nd) the site be developed and that the Trevallyn State Recreational Area be improved.\n\nIn 1982, in the study 'Duck Reach and the Electric Light, Launceston' by Mark Kozakiewicz 1982, the following suggestions were investigated:\n\n1) The reuse of the Duck Reach Power Station as a museum of early Tasmanian hydro electric power development.\n\n2) The rehabilitation of the old suspension bridge to link the two sides of the South Esk River.\n\n3) The reuse of the engineers' cottages for support services.\n\n4) The establishment of walks from the power station.\n\n5) Examine the possibilities for relating the activities of the Trevallyn State Recreational Reserve to activities at the power station.\n\nIn the âCliff Grounds Reserve Interim Management Planâ 1982 by the Launceston City Council Parks and Recreation Department, recommendations were made similar to those made in the âRiveredge Studyâ.\n\nIn 1995 on the centenary of its first opening, the power station was made weatherproof, the suspension bridge restored and the building re-opened as a museum.\nThe Tasmanian Legislative Council Hansard of April 2011 records a lengthy debate in which Kerry Finch MLC for Rosevears suggestsâ the resurrection of the Duck Reach Power Station as a working mini-power stationâ as a means for getting more \"water down the Gorge\". It would be an understatement to suggest that this has been a favourite discussion point in Launceston for longer than many would like to remember as a possible solution to clear some of the silt in Home Reach where the Esk Rivers meet to form the Tamar River.\n\nIn March 2012 the Launceston City Council voted in favour of investigating the redevelopment of the historic Duck Reach power station for power generation with initial interest from Hydro Tasmania.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1927851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927851", "title": "Michelstadt", "text": "Michelstadt\n\nMichelstadt in the Odenwald is a town in the Odenwaldkreis (district) in southern Hesse, Germany between Darmstadt and Heidelberg. It has a population of around 16,000. \n\nMichelstadt is the biggest town in the Odenwaldkreis and borders on the district seat of Erbach.\n\nMichelstadt borders in the north on the municipality of Brombachtal, the town of Bad KÃ¶nig and the municipality of LÃ¼tzelbach, in the east on the town of Klingenberg, the market municipalities of Laudenbach and Kleinheubach, the town of Miltenberg, the market municipality of Weilbach, the town of Amorbach and the market municipality of Kirchzell (all seven in Miltenberg district in Bavaria), in the south on the town of Erbach, and in the west on the municipalities of Mossautal and Reichelsheim.\n\nMichelstadt's \"Stadtteile\", besides the main town, also called Michelstadt, are Rehbach, Steinbach, Steinbuch, Stockheim, Vielbrunn, Weiten-GesÃ¤Ã and WÃ¼rzberg.\n\nMichelstadt had its first documentary mention in 741 from Mayor of the Palace Carloman, Charlemagneâs uncle.\n\nMichelstadt is one of the oldest settlements in the inner Odenwald. Its castle grew out of a Frankish baronial estate. This was built into a refuge for the local inhabitants. As a royal estate, Prince Carloman donated it in 741 to Saint Bonifaceâs pupil Burchard, the first Bishop of WÃ¼rzburg. This donation was apparently meant for Bishop Burchard personally, for the \"Michelnstat\" area passed back to the Frankish Crown upon Burchardâs death in 791.\nIn 815, the \"Michlinstat\" area was donated once again. In recognition of his great merit as confidant at Charlemagneâs court, Einhard acquired the main town and all land within two leagues (roughly 15Â km) from Charlemagneâs son, Louis the Pious, as a freehold. Einhard also built the \"\". In 819, he bequeathed his Odenwald holdings to Lorsch Abbey and in so doing precisely defined the boundaries of the \"Mark Michelstadt\". Upon Einhardâs death on 14 March 840, the monastery came into its inheritance.\nIn the 17th century, the first houses outside the town wall were built. In 1773, a new town gate was built, called the \"Neutor\" (âNew Gateâ). In the 19th century, the gate towers were all torn down one after the other.\n\nIn 1806, Michelstadt, along with the County of Erbach, passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse.\n\nThe building of the railway line and its completion through to Darmstadt in 1870 and then Eberbach in 1881 brought Michelstadt a sharp economic upswing. Out of what was once a small farming community grew a sizeable town with important industrial operations on the foundation of the centuries-old ironworking. A new economic era began. From the clothweaversâ and dyersâ guild grew a cloth factory; from foundries grew machine factories. Ivory carving was a starting point for businesses in the souvenir industry and plastics processing.\n\nIn 1962, the town hosted the second \"Hessentag\" state festival.\n\nIn 2007, a decision to merge the town with the neighbouring town of Erbach was thwarted by a civic vote.\n\nThe municipal election held 2006 and 2016 yielded the following results:\n\nThe voter turnout in 2016 was 49,7 %.\n\nThe mayor, Stephan Kelbert, in office since 16 September 2009, was elected on 8 March 2009 with a share of 52.7% in the first round of voting.\n\n\nThe town's arms might be described thus: Per fess azure two mullets Or and Or diapered.\n\nMichelstadt was granted these arms in 1541 along with its new seal by Count Georg of Erbach. The diapering in the lower half of the escutcheon is unhistoric, and only appeared in the 17th century. Indeed, the escutcheon on the Town Hall, pictured in this article, does not show it. The mullets (six-pointed star shapes) come from the Counts' arms, but why the parting per fess (horizontal division across the middle) was chosen is a mystery. Except for the diapering, the arms have not changed since the 16th century.\n\n\n\n\nMichelstadt's Old Town features many timber-frame houses. Particularly worthy of mention are the following buildings, some within the old town, others in the surrounding countryside: The historic Town Hall, the \"Diebsturm\" (\"Thief's Tower\") at the town wall, the \"Kellereihof\" (a Frankish, early mediaeval castle complex refurbished in an early Renaissance style) in the town wall ring, the late Gothic town church (late 13th century), the \"Einhards-Basilika\", the palace of the Counts at Erbach-FÃ¼rstenau (\"Schloss FÃ¼rstenau\", within which are parts of an old moated castle in Michelstadt-Steinbach), \"Jagdschloss Eulbach\" with an English landscape garden and a Roman bath and castra, formerly part of the Neckar-Odenwald Limes.\n\nMichelstadt's timber-frame town hall, whose image was used on a Deutsche Post stamp, was built in 1484 in the late Gothic style and later remodelled on the inside many times; from 1743 to 1903 it was covered in shakes. The town hall's main floor served from the beginning as a market hall, and was built using jettying. The back (east) wall was originally part of the graveyard wall, upon which the ground floor's upper bressumer was laid. To this day it is unknown who the master builder was, although it is assumed that the driving force behind the project could have been \"Schenk\" Adolar von Erbach and Bishop Johann von Dalberg (his adviser).\n\nThe town church, completed in 1490, was built to replace a Carolingian stone church by Einhard, itself built on the site of a former wooden church. The nave's columns and the two aisles' walls were built in 1475. The quire dates from 1461; the antechoir's north wall is even older â Carolingian. Until the 1970s, the church housed one of the most valuable libraries in Germany in its belltower containing more than a thousand volumes belonging to Michelstadt-born Nicolaus Matz, who was capitular in Speyer, and who bequeathed this collection to his hometown and its citizens in the late 14th century. Since the 1970s the library has been housed in a storehouse specially converted for it at the Michelstadt coaching inn that belonged to the Thurn und Taxis noble family, who played a key rÃ´le in European postal services in the 16th century. The former church on this spot was built over a brook that comes up here, called the \"KiliansfloÃ\", an early Celtic-Germanic worship site and later a Roman Mithraic worship site. The thus channelled \"KiliansfloÃ\" fed not only the baptismal font, but also all the town's fountains. The \"KiliansfloÃ\", however, does not actually rise here, but rather far outside the town. It then disappears into the ground not far from the graveyard, springing up again in the middle of town.\n\nThe \"Einhards-Basilika\" was built by Einhard, Charlemagne's chronicler and confidant. The Carolingian church built between 824 and 827 is one of the very few Carolingian buildings that have survived largely intact. The Basilica's crypt once housed Saints Peter's and Marcellinus's relics, which had been stolen from Rome on Einhard's instructions by his notary Ratleik. His servants' nightmares and the remains' \"sweating blood\" there, however, made Einhard think that this arrangement did not feel right. He thus transferred himself, his wife, the relics and his seat to Ober-Mulinheim am Main, now known as Seligenstadt, which thereby became a pilgrimage site with a new, larger basilica.\n\nThe story that has been handed down says that the relics hidden from Rome were transported to Saint-Maurice-en-Valais, now in Switzerland, whence they were then brought to Michelstadt by a cheering pilgrimage procession.\n\nThe Basilica in Steinbach was converted, expanded, and rededicated many times and later served first as a hospital and then in the 17th century as a barn. Once it was rediscovered in 1873 as being Carolingian, the exploration and safeguarding of the parts of the basilica that were still intact began.\n\nThe \"Einhards-Basilika\" was until 1967 owned by the princely Counts of Erbach-FÃ¼rstenau. The grounds are now owned by the state of Hesse.\n\nThe palace complex is a series of building styles which includes remains of the old Electorate of Mainz border fortifications and moated castle (about 1300) on the north side to the Gothic works by the stonecutters who came from Strasbourg to Steinbach, to the gigantic Renaissance-style gateway arch (1588) between the moated castle's two western corner towers which replaced the castle wall and opened the gloomy, dank courtyard back up to the former castle garden, to the Renaissance palace mill, a former mint (today a run-of-the-river hydroelectric station), to the Baroque \"Kavaliershaus\" (a palace outbuilding for staff and guests) on the MÃ¼mling, to the Neoclassical residential wing, the \"Neues Palais\" (1810/11) and the late Baroque orangery in the palace park, which was built in the English style. The orangery's upper floor housed the small palace theatre.\n\n\"Schloss FÃ¼rstenau\" is still a dwelling, with the head of the house of the princely Counts of Erbach-FÃ¼rstenau and his family still living there. The former Electorate of Mainz defence facility lay on the property of the \"Schenk\" of Erbach (a forefather of the noble family, which at that time had not yet branched) and passed into his ownership in 1355. Public access to the ground and is possible by day. At the outer bailey with its gateway arch from 1765 some visual artists have taken up residence (in among other places the former stables from after 1765).\n\nRight near WÃ¼rzberg, in the middle of a clearing are found the remains of the Roman Castrum of WÃ¼rzberg, which was built about AD 100 as part of the Neckar-Odenwald-Limes, and was used for about 60 years before the border was shifted farther east. The castrum can only be made out by an earthen wall. The Roman bathhouse, on the other hand, which stands right next to the castrum, has been partially restored; the floors have been replaced and the wall has been built back up to a height of about a metre. Despite the bath's small size, which was only meant for the fort's 120-man garrison, the design of a Roman bathhouse is easily recognizable.\n\nNot far from the outlying centre of Vielbrunn, in the area around the former hunting palace of the Princes of LÃ¶wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, traces of the Castrum of Hainhaus can still be found. Furthermore, on Michelstadt's eastern outskirts can be found the Castrum of Eulbach near the \"Eulbacher Park\", a landscaped English park from the early 19th century with its hunting palace and an adjoining wildlife park.\n\n\n\nIn Michelstadt the two \"BundesstraÃen\" 45 and 47 intersect, both are old trade roads from Frankfurt am Main to Augsburg and from Worms to WÃ¼rzburg respectively.\n\nThe town is served by a railway station on the \"Odenwaldbahn\" (RMV Line 65; Eberbach â Erbach â Michelstadt â Darmstadt â Frankfurt / Hanau). Regionalbahn, Stadtexpress and Regionalexpress trains of the VIAS GmbH stop here.\n\nThere is also the special landing facility \"Flugplatz Michelstadt\" (airfield), which lies roughly 2Â km from the town and is run by a club.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The line was constructed to avoid a curfew for freight trains that restricts them from operating in the suburban area during peak hours.\n\nThe SSFL forms part of a dedicated freight only corridor between Macarthur and Port Botany. The line is managed by the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), while the adjacent passenger lines are managed by RailCorp.\n\nThe SSFL branches from and runs parallel to the Main South line for its full 36 kilometre length from Macarthur to Birrong. The line is an unelectrified, bi-directional single track with 1,800m long passing loops at Glenfield and Leightonfield. Apart from its end points, the SSFL has no interface with the existing network.\n\nFrom a junction south of Macarthur, the line runs to the west of the existing tracks to Ingleburn where it joins an existing relief line to Glenfield built in the mid-1990s. Just north of Glenfield the line crosses to the east of the existing tracks via a flyover, with future access to the proposed Moorebank Intermodal Terminal. The line continues to parallel the Main South line to Sefton, incorporating the existing Leightonfield Freight loop and sidings. At Sefton Junction, the line passes under the Bankstown line and joins the Metropolitan Goods line which provides access to the Enfield and Port Botany marshalling yards.\n\nDelays to freight services operating to and from Sydney via the Main South line had long been a problem, but it wasn't until the formation of the National Rail Corporation that any plan was devised to resolve it.\n\nIn February 1992, the Federal Government allocated $71m for the construction of a dedicated freight line from Macarthur to Enfield as part of the One Nation infrastructure project. It soon became apparent that to complete the project would cost in the region of $250m. Instead the funding was used to complete a number of smaller projects, including building a 6.6 kilometre relief line between Ingleburn and Glenfield. This single, non-electrified line was used by both CountryLink passenger and freight services.\n\nIn May 2006, the Australian Rail Track Corporation revived the project. Approval was obtained in October 2008 and construction commenced in early 2009, focusing on the section between Cabramatta and Sefton. By August 2009 construction was under way along the whole corridor. In November 2009 poor planning led to the ARTC suspending the project for 10 months while it relocated utilities.\n\nIn September 2010 the ARTC announced the resumption of the project with an estimated completion date of early 2013.\n\nIn June 2012, the Sefton Junction to Leightonfield section opened allowing the connection from the yard at the latter to the RailCorp network to be severed. In December 2012, the rest of the line was completed officially opening on 21 January 2013.\n\nThe construction of the new line required modifications to several stations along the route. Minto, Casula, Warwick Farm and Sefton received Easy Access upgrades. A new concourse was constructed at Cabramatta and the footbridge was extended at Leumeah.\n\nThe line is normally only used by freight services, but during engineering possessions on the adjacent RailCorp tracks, NSW TrainLink XPT services have travelled on it. Freight trains travelling to the Minto Container Terminal continue to travel on RailCorp tracks.\n\nConstruction of the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal commenced in April 2017. A connection between the SSFL and the terminal will be established.\n\nTransport for NSW is planning to construct a Western Sydney Freight Line and provide a capacity enhancement for the SSFL sometime after 2024.\n\n\n"}

It is a resident breeder in tropical South America in Trinidad, Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, northern Brazil and northeastern Peru.\n\nIn 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the black-crested antshrike in his \"Ornithologie\" based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected in Canada. He used the French name \"La Pie-Griesche de Canada\" and the Latin name \"Lanius Canadensis\". Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his \"Systema Naturae\" for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson in his \"Ornithologie\". One of these was the black-crested antshrike. Linnaeus included a brief description, used the binomial name \"Lanius canadensis\" and cited Brisson's work. This species is now placed in the genus \"Sakesphorus\" that was erected by the British ornithologist Charles Chubb in 1918. Six subspecies are recognised.\n\nThe black-crested antshrike is typically long, and weighs 24 g. The adult male has a black head, prominent crest, throat and breast, a rufous-brown back, black wings with white feather edges, a short black tail and a white belly. The female and immature males have a chestnut crest and head with black and white barring on the cheeks, dull brown upperparts, black-streaked buff underparts, and browner wing and tail feathers than the male.\n\nThis is a bird of undergrowth in mangrove or other swampy forest and thickets near water. It is usually found as territorial pairs.\n\nThe female lays two purple-lined white eggs in a deep cup nest suspended below a branch or vine. They are incubated by both sexes for 14 days to hatching, the female always brooding at night. The chicks fledge in another 12 days.\n\nThe black-crested antshrike feeds on insects and other arthropods gleaned from foliage. It will also take small lizards and berries. It is an inconspicuous species, often first located by its song, an accelerating and ascending series of musical notes ', or the call, a snarled '.\n\n"}

{"id": "1927880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927880", "title": "Lake Margaret Power Station", "text": "Lake Margaret Power Station\n\nThe Lake Margaret Power Stations comprise two hydroelectric power stations located in Western Tasmania, Australia. The power stations are part of the KingYolande Power Scheme and are owned and operated by Hydro Tasmania. Officially the Upper Lake Margaret Power Station, a conventional hydroelectric power station, and the Lower Lake Margaret Power Station, a mini-hydroelectric power station, the stations are generally collectively referred to in the singular format as the Lake Margaret Power Station. The stations are located approximately apart.\n\nThe Upper Lake Margaret Power Station was constructed by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company between 1911 and 1914. In 1984, the station was sold to the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission and was officially decommissioned in 2006 and after a multimillion-dollar refit was recommissioned in 2009. The Lower Lake Margaret Power Station was built also by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company in 1931 and decommissioned in 1995. After the implementation of a mini-hydro project in 2009, the project was recommissioned in 2010.\n\nPart of the KingYolande scheme that comprises three hydroelectric power stations, the Lake Margaret Power Stations utilise water from the naturally-forming Lake Margaret which was dammed in 1914 to increase the storage volume and head. A key feature of the development is a -long woodstave pipeline which connects the dam to a steel penstock which feeds the power station. In 2009 a new pipeline of Alaskan Yellow Cedar replaced the native King Billy Pine pipeline constructed in 1937.\n\nThe upper power station was recommissioned in 2009 by Hydro Tasmania and has six Boving Pelton-type turbines and one James Gordon Pelton-type turbine with a combined generating capacity of of electricity. Within the station building, each of the seven horizontal axis turbines are connected to open wheel generators. The first four machines were installed in 1914. Two more were added in 1918 and a seventh machine was added in 1930. Each turbine is fitted with a motorised inlet valve. The generators are connected to individual machine circuit breakers which are connected to circuit breakers for each of the four transmission circuits contained in a split bus. The station output is estimated to be annually.\n\nThe lower power station was recommissioned in 2010 by Hydro Tasmania and has a three-jet Turgo turbine with a generating capacity of of electricity. Water is delivered to the station via a wood stave pipeline and Fibre Reinforced Plastic penstock. The station output is estimated to be annually.\n\nIn 1911 the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company decided to make more extensive use of electricity in its smelting operations in the mining town of Queenstown, on Tasmania's west coast. It selected Lake Margaret, a small lake high up on Mount Sedgwick, to the north-west of the town, as its catchment area.\n\nIn 1911, construction of a dam was commenced, which raised the original lake by . The water was originally conveyed from the dam via a wood stave pipeline. The Australian Woodpipe Company was consulted and employed to construct the wooden pipeline. The Mount Lyell Mining & Railway Company determined that not only was a wooden pipeline cheaper to construct, but it was also more efficient and durable than iron or steel. The local native Tasmanian timber King Billy Pine was studied but it was decided not to be suitable.\n\nThe wood stave pipeline was subsequently constructed from Oregon Pine (Douglas Fir), which was imported from Canada. The timber was shipped to the west coast town of Strahan and was transported to the Lake Margaret precinct via the ABT Railway. This pipeline rapidly deteriorated and in 1938 was replaced by a King Billy Pine wood stave pipeline, with the timber sourced locally. This pipeline was still in service until the 30 June 2006 closure of the Lake Margaret Power Scheme.\n\nThe wood stave pipeline originally joined two steel penstock pipes which dropped to the power station building in the Yolande Valley below. Due to the efficiency of the scheme another penstock pipe was added in 1919. Due to internal deterioration these pipes were replaced in 1969 with a single steel pipe, by contractor John Holland. This replacement coincided with major refurbishment of the power station building, renewal of sections of the Lower Power Scheme wood stave pipeline, replacement of the transmission lines between the power station and the Queenstown substation, and post-stressing of the Lake Margaret dam wall.\n\nThe Lake Margaret Lower Power Scheme was opened in 1931. Showcasing the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the men in charge at the time, it was located downstream from the main power station and utilised water that had already powered the turbines in the main station. It housed a single Boving-Francis type turbine which, whilst having to be manually started, could be remotely controlled from the main power station, demonstrating a unique system that is considered significant in the history of power generation in Tasmania and Australia. The Lower Power Scheme was mothballed in the early 1990s.\n\nThe power plant itself produced of peak power from seven Pelton turbines, with an average output of (limited by rainfall into the catchment), four of which were in service from when the building opened in 1914, two since 1919 and the 7th since 1930.\n\nThroughout 2005 the old plant was still in full-time use, but became the subject of debate. The Lake Margaret Precinct and Power Station were nominated for inclusion in the state heritage register due to the unique nature of the station's role as an integral part of West Coast history that has not been closed down or destroyedthe fate of many of the man made structures on the west coast that no longer serve purposes for the mining or other industries.\n\nOn 30 June 2006 the Lake Margaret Power Station closed, due to the cost and increasing difficulty of maintaining the decrepit King Billy Pine pipeline. In the days immediately before closure, five machines were operating at full output, one was idle due to insufficient water pressure and another out of service due to requiring replacement turbine buckets.\n\nAt the time of closure the pipeline was estimated to be losing 10% of the water it carried due to leakage. During early 2007 the extent of leakage was sufficient of itself to draw down the level in Lake Margaret by around 10% during a period of very low rainfall. At this time the pipeline was still under pressure although the power station remained closed.\n\nHydro Tasmania proposed refurbishment of the scheme with a return to operation around 2009-10. Community consultation found a strong preference for refurbishment using the existing machines plus a new wood stave pipeline rather than the use of new machines or a steel pipe.\n\nAny reuse of the existing machinery would likely involve the installation of automatic shutdown capability to avoid the need for 24-hour manning of the power station in order to improve the economics of refurbishment. All of Tasmania's other major hydro-electric power stations were either originally built to operate unmanned (standard procedure for new power stations in Tasmania since the 1950s) or have been refurbished in recent years to enable unmanned operation.\n\nOn 18 March 2007 Hydro Tasmania hosted the 'Back to Lake Margaret Day' at the Lake Margaret Hydro-Electric Scheme. The event was an open invitation to all people interested in the past and future of the Lake Margaret scheme. Previous residents and employees were invited to attend, and the day was officially opened by Alex Wilkinson, the oldest known person who has an association with the scheme.\n\nDuring the day the mothballed power station was open for inspection, as were two of the empty \"ca.\" 1914 cottages which had formerly housed many of the attendees at the event. The village hall was a hive of activity during the day, with aged photographs being pinned the walls and people reminiscing about their time at Lake Margaret. The date was chosen to coincide with the Mount Lyell Twenty-Five Year Reunion Dinner, which was held in Queenstown on the same weekend and included many past employees who also have an association with Lake Margaret. About 200 people attended the Back To Lake Margaret Day.\n\nIn June 2008 a decision was made to return the Lake Margaret Power Station back to operational capacity. Following the various public and other efforts - the Lake Margaret system was reopened in 2009. The refurbishment included rebuilding the wood stave penstock for the Upper Power Station. The upper power station was reopened on 12 November 2009, and the lower power station on 23 July 2010.\n\nIn October 2014, the \"Queenstown Heritage and Arts Festival\" (now known as The Unconformity) programme included events and arts works at the Lake Margaret precinct.\n\nThe power scheme received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1927887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927887", "title": "Cranberry juice", "text": "Cranberry juice\n\nCranberry juice is the liquid juice of the cranberry, typically manufactured to contain sugar, water, and other fruit juices. Cranberry â a fruit native to North America â is recognized for its bright red color, unique, tart taste, and versatility for product manufacturing. Major cranberry products include dried cranberry, cranberry sauce, frozen cranberry, cranberry powder, and cranberry juice.\n\nThe term \"cranberry juice cocktail\" or \"cranberry juice blend\" refers to products that contain about 28% cranberry juice, with the remainder either from other fruit juice concentrates (typically grape, apple or pear), water, and added sugar to improve palatability. Low-calorie cranberry juice products use non-caloric sweeteners. The tartness of cranberry juice derives from its mixed content of polyphenols, including flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, phenolic acids, and ellagitannins.\n\nDespite a long-held reputation for providing antibacterial activity against urinary tract infections (UTIs), cranberry juice has no such proven effects, as determined by a Cochrane review of completed clinical research and a scientific panel for the European Food Safety Authority which concluded a cause and effect relationship could not be established between cranberry consumption and risk of UTIs.\n\nA cup of standard 100% cranberry juice, amounting to 248 grams or 8 ounces, contains vitamin C as an ingredient to preserve freshness, with other micronutrients that may be added during manufacturing. Cranberry juice is an acidic drink with a typical pH between 2.3 and 2.5.\n\nOne half cup of cranberry juice provides 60 calories, 20% of the Daily Value for vitamin C, and counts as one-half of a fruit serving toward the United State MyPlate daily nutrition guide.\n\nIn 2008, there was tentative evidence that long-term use of cranberry juice might help prevent symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), but this finding was refuted in 2012 with a conclusion that \"14 further studies suggest that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated,\" and \"cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs.\" The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the evidence and concluded a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of cranberry products and reducing the risk of UTIs.\n\nOne systematic review in 2017 showed that cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of UTIs, indicating that cranberry products may be effective particularly for individuals with recurrent infections. When the quality of meta-analyses on the efficacy of cranberry products for preventing or treating UTIs was examined, large variation was evident, resulting from inconsistencies in clinical research methods.\n\nIn September 2017, Ocean Spray, a major cranberry juice manufacturer, submitted a health claim petition to the FDA. According to the FDA's February 2018 response letter, the company had \"requested that FDA authorize a health claim for the relationship between the consumption of cranberry juice products and a reduced risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women.\" The FDA stated that they would consider the petition for a \"qualified health claim.\" This type of health claim label does not require \"significant scientific agreement\" as the FDA's label with a higher standard, the \"authorized health claim,\" does. Rather, \"qualified health claims\" only require that the claim be \"supported by some scientific evidence.\" These types of health claims also \"do not\" need to \"meet the significant scientific agreement standard\" and must be accompanied by a disclaimer stating that there is insufficient evidence of the product affecting a disease, such as UTI. Further FDA guidance in 2019 notified cranberry juice manufacturers that added sugars necessary for making the juice appealing to consumers had to be declared on the nutrition facts panel of product labels, and the amount of sugar used would be reviewed by the FDA under its \"enforcement discretion\".\n\nIn October 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's recommendation for self-care for lower UTIs in people aged 16 and over states that \"no evidence was found on cranberry products or urine alkalinising agents to treat lower UTI\".\n\nThere is no high-quality evidence that cranberry juice affects gum health by preventing bacterial adhesion within oral epithelium tissue and preventing dental plaque accumulation. Cranberry juice is acidic, with a pH level between 2.3 and 2.5, a level of acidity that may erode tooth enamel.\n\nCranberries are a kind of tart red berry produced by various plant species, but it is the large-fruited, or âAmerican cranberryâ (\"Vaccinium macrocarpon\"), that is farmed for commercial production. Currently, the main cranberry farming Canadian provinces are British Columbia, QuÃ©bec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. However, the lower temperatures present in the Eastern provinces require the use of irrigation and flooding to prevent frost damage and moisture loss. Wet harvesting is the common harvesting method used for cranberries that are to become cranberry juice. A paddled machine called a water reel harvester is used to separate the ripe cranberries from the vines, then collected through a large suction pipe and transported by truck to a processing plant. At the processing plant, the cranberries go through a sequence of fruit crushing, mash maceration, mash heating, juice pressing, and pasteurization to produce a cranberry concentrate that is separated from pulp. To prepare a cranberry juice/cocktail product, cranberry juice concentrate is reconstituted with varying amounts of water, specified by the solicitation, contract, or purchase order.\n\nDuring growth, cranberry quality can be affected by various pests including: weeds, insects, mites, vertebrate animals, and diseases, resulting in the need for physical, biological or chemical treatments to reduce these impacts. Canada has a \"Pesticide Risk Reduction Program\" where Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency work to confront the dangers pesticides pose to the environment and human health. Flooding and irrigation often remain the best technique to deter pesticide resistant pests in the cranberry cultivation process.\n\nTraditionally, cranberry juice is commercially sterilized though thermal processing to eliminate any pathogenic or spoilage-causing microorganisms and spores. The prepared cranberry juice product is heat treated by high temperature-short time (HTST) or ultra-high temperature (UHT) techniques and packaged into aseptic, hermetically-sealed containers. During thermal processing, the cranberry juice receives a heat treatment time equivalent to a 5-log pathogen reduction. Often, the bacterium \"Clostridium botulinum\" is given special attention during thermal processing techniques of food. However, \"C. botulinum\" does not grow and produce toxins below a pH of 4.6 and cranberry juice is classified as a high-acid food with a pH of 2.3 to 2.9.\n\nIn 2017, new methods of cranberry juice processing included high pressure processing (HHP) and pulsified electric fields (PEF) technology. HHP treatment involves applying pressure (80,000 psi or 550 MPa) to cranberry juice for 1 to 9 minutes to eliminate any harmful bacteria, moulds and viruses. The resulting raw cranberry juice, without thermal processing, is classified as a novel food item by Health Canada. PEF treatment involves generating a high-intensity electric field inducing a flux of electrical current to flow through the food product to eliminate harmful microorganisms. PEF treated cranberry juice does not alter the flavour, colour, or aroma profile of the cranberries used, unlike the traditional thermally processed method.\n\nNaturally, cranberries are low in sugar content and have a tart or astringent taste. As a result, unsweetened cranberry juice is generally considered unpalatable by consumers. To make the juice more palatable to consumers, the tart flavor can be changed by blending with other fruit juices or the addition of sugar or sugar substitutes.\n\nAll cranberry juice products are required to be packed in aseptic, hermetically seal containers (plastic bottles, cans, cartons) in accordance with good manufacturing practices of their country. The typical container size used are 11.5 or 64 fluid ounce, and each must be filled with the product by at least 90 percent. Cranberry juice products should also not be packaged more than 90 days prior to their delivery, unless specified in the order. Ocean Spray and Fruit d'Or cranberry juice products have a frozen shelf life of 24 months and 36 months, respectively.\n\nCranberry juice container labels have the following information printed: product name and code, nutrition facts table, lot/drum number, date of packaging, brix, acidity, net weight, manufacturer name, manufacturer address and country of origin. According to Canada's composition claims, a \"no preservatives\" claim can be added to cranberry juice products if it only contains naturally-occurring constituents that provide a preservative function such as benzoates.\n\nFor Canadian markets, cranberry juice is regulated as a processed product under fruit juices. Cranberry juice must be made from sound, clean, and ripe cranberries. One or more of the following dry sweetening ingredients may be added: sugar, invert sugar, and dextrose. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), the common name of this product may appear as âcranberry juice drink/coolerâ if at least 25% of the named juice is contained within the net quantity of the product.\n\nIn Canada, cranberries are graded into two categories: Canada No. 1 and Canada Domestic. The cranberries of Canada No. 1 grade are required to be fairly clean; be uniform in size; and free from any damage and/or defect that affects the appearance, edibility, or shipment quality. The cranberries of Canada Domestic grade are required to be reasonably clean; and be free from any damage and/or defect that seriously affects the appearance, edibility, or shipment quality. Furthermore, all grades must be properly packaged; be sound; have a minimum surface area of 65% coloured red; and be free of insects and insect larvae.\n\nFor US markets, cranberry juice from concentrate is a blended mixture of cranberry juice or cranberry juice concentrate, water, sweeteners, and ascorbic acid. The cranberry juice or concentrate in the mixture must be produced from clean, sound, mature, well-colored, and washed, fresh or frozen cranberries (\"Vaccinium macrocarpon\"). One or more of the following sweetening ingredients may be added: sucrose, liquid sugar, invert sugar syrup, or high fructose corn syrup (40% or greater). The use of food additives (color, flavours, or acids) into cranberry juice depends on the percentage of cranberry juice or concentrate by volume. Cranberry juice mixtures with 25% or 27% contain none of the mentioned additives, except for ascorbic acid. Cranberry juice mixtures with 22% contain no added color or flavors, but citric acid may be added. Cranberry juice mixtures with 20% may contain color, flavors, and citric acid. The finished cranberry juice from concentrate product should yield a minimum of one part cranberry juice concentrate to three parts water with a minimum Brix level of 12Â°. Additionally, each cranberry juice product should be fortified with Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid), with each serving size delivering not less than 100% of the current US Referenced Daily Intake. The minimum titratable acidity of the cranberry juice product must be 1.67% wt/wt, measured as citric acid.\n\nCranberry juice may interfere with coumarins used as blood thinners, such as warfarin, causing an unstable INR. The British National Formulary (BNF) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) both advise avoiding concomitant use.\n\nCommercially cultivated in the United States and Canada, cranberries are harvested in the autumn for manufacturing of juice and other products. A barrel of US cranberries weighing cost US$ 57.60 in 2017, but the price fell to $22.30 per barrel in 2019 due to international trade wars with the United States, causing the market to shift to more purchases from Canada.\n\nIncluding cranberries used for juice production, Americans consume some 400 million pounds (180 million kg) of cranberries per year. About 95% of the annual US cranberry harvest is used to make juice or juice blends. Wisconsin was the leading producer of cranberries in the United States in 2017. Cranberries and juice concentrate exported from the United States were the objects of imposed tariffs during trade wars with the European Union, China, Mexico, and Canada over the period 2017-19.\n\n"}

Together with Turku Cathedral, the castle is one of the oldest buildings still in use and the largest surviving medieval building in Finland. It was founded in the late 13th century and stands on the banks of the Aura River. The castle served as a bastion and administrative centre in Eastland, as Finland was known during its time as a province of Sweden. Only once did the castle figure in the defence of the realm, when Russian invaders from Novgorod destroyed Turku in 1318. It more frequently played a role in internal struggles for power within Sweden and the Kalmar Union. The castle's heyday was in the mid-16th century during the reign of Duke John of Finland and Catherine Jagellon. That was when the Renaissance Floor and King's and Queen's hall were built, along with other features. It lost its status as an administrative centre in the 17th century after Per Brahe's period as governor-general of Finland came to an end. Turku castle is today Finland's most visited museum, with attendance reaching 200,000 in some years. In addition, many of the larger rooms are used for municipal functions.\n\nA start was made on building the castle in about 1280. The Swedish conquerors of Finland intended it originally as a military fortress. During the next two centuries its defences were strengthened and living quarters were added. The castle served as a bastion and administrative centre in Eastland, as Finland was known during the time as a province of Sweden. The main part of the castle was extended considerably during the 16th century after Gustav Vasa had ascended the Swedish throne and his son John headed the Finnish administration following his promotion to duke. The bailey was also supplemented and the round tower at the southeast corner of the bailey was added. Since then no part of the castle has been added or extended, only repaired.\n\nThe castle was ruled in different stages of its history by the castle sheriff, commander, regent, duke or governor-general. Its significance as a defensive fortress and administrative centre varied throughout the ages according to the political situation. Only once did the castle actually figure in the defence of the realm. This was when Russian invaders from Novgorod destroyed Turku in 1318. On the other hand, it frequently played a role in internal struggles for power within Sweden and the Kalmar Union. Not until the end of 16th century did it really enjoy peace. The castle lost its status as an administrative centre in the 17th century after Per Brahe's period as governor-general of Finland came to an end.\n\nMany accidents have assailed the castle, especially numerous sieges. In 1614, when King Gustav II Adolf visited the castle, a tremendous fire destroyed the wooden structure of the main castle almost completely. After this the main castle was abandoned and used partly as a store, partly just stood empty. A new accident beset the castle in the summer of 1941 soon after the Continuation War had begun when a Russian incendiary bomb hit the main castle.\nThe bailey functioned as an administrative centre when the main castle stood empty. In addition to the governor-general the lord-lieutenant lived there during the 17th century and after the period of Greater Wrath it housed the provincial government for some time. One of the most colourful periods in the castle's history was when it was a prison from the 18th century to the end of 19th century. When the Finnish war began in 1808 the castle was used by the Russian navy and only handed over to the Finnish authorities after the country had been granted autonomous status within the Russian empire a couple of decades later. The Turku Historical Museum founded in 1881 began its occupation of the bailey immediately after the museum was founded and later it was given quarters in the castle itself.\n\nThe renovation of the castle, which was begun before the Second World War and interrupted by Finland's two wars with the Soviet Union, was completed in 1987. The completely restored castle was handed over on October 12, 1993 to the City of Turku which is entrusted with its operation for the Finnish state, its owner. The building is owned and maintained by the Finnish state and is entrusted to the use of the city of Turku. The castle functions in its entirety as a historical museum as part of the Turku provincial museum. In the main part of the castle are banquet rooms for the city of Turku, a church for the local congregation and also restaurants in both the main castle and the bailey. Today the castle is once more experiencing a heyday as it has achieved the status of being one of Finland's most visited museums.\n\nThe layout of the castle consists of the Medieval keep (\"pÃ¤Ã¤linna\") and Renaissance bailey (\"esilinna\"). The keep consists of a square fort with two square gateway towers whose wall thickness at the base is some .\n\nIn the Middle Ages the castle was surrounded by a moat conjoining with the River Aura, the castle effectively lying on an island. The keep was completed in the early 15th century. Construction of the bailey was begun in the late 15th century and finished in the 16th. The bailey is not as heavily fortified as the keep, but it has several turrets. The Renaissance construction work included heavy modification of nearly all the rooms in the older medieval part of the castle. Since the Renaissance no additions have been made to the castle.\n\nThe modest military fortification grew into a massive greystone castle, whose solid walls have witnessed many milestones in Nordic history. The castle has been subject to numerous sieges and several battles have been waged aside its walls. Of all Finnish castles, Turku castle has the most warlike history besides Vyborg castle and Olavinlinna.\n\nThe castle's heyday was in the mid-16th century during the reign of Duke John of Finland and Catherine Jagellon. That was when the Renaissance Floor and King's and Queen's hall were built, along with other features.\n\nThe castle was the center of the historical province of Finland Proper, and the administrative center of all of Finland. Its strong walls and dungeons also served as the state prison for centuries; even today, a prison is colloquially referred to as \"linna\" (castle) in Finnish. The castle has been the place of many historical events; in 1573â1579, for example, the deposed Swedish queen \nKarin MÃ¥nsdotter was kept prisoner here.\n\nThe castle is Finland's most visited museum, with attendance reaching 200,000 in some years. In addition, many of the larger rooms are used for municipal functions.\n\nVarious castellans, bailiffs, military commanders, governors who held Turku Castle in the Middle Ages:\n\n\nThe Turku Castle is the setting for the fairy tale \"The Tomten in Ãbo Castle\" written by Zachris Topelius in 1849. At the time of writing, Turku Castle was badly damaged, and just like Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" in the case of Notre-Dame de Paris, the story of Topelius had a major influence on the desire to restore this important landmark of Turku.\n\nThe walls of the castle or the castle itself are also featured in many Finnish films. These include the adventure film \"Sadan miekan mies\" from 1951 directed by Ilmari Unho and drama film \"The Girl King\" from 2015 directed by Mika KaurismÃ¤ki.\n\n\n"}

Its administrative centre is located 241 metres above sea level.\n\nLa Molina is located between 12Â° 00' 07\" S, 76Â° 57' 00\" and 76Â° 51' 00\" W.\n\n\nAccording to the 2005 census by the INEI, the district has 124,468 inhabitants, a population density of 1,893 persons/kmÂ² and 33,646 households.\nAnnual median income varies greatly.\n\nThere are two possible origins, both referring to the owners of the estates located in the area in the Peruvian Republican era. \n\nIn the years before its creation, the estates located in the geographic area of the district (Granados, Melgarejo, La Rinconada, Camacho and La Molina) had been already sold (or expropriated by the Juan Velasco Alvarado administration) and divided, giving origin to smaller yet large properties. Soon, due to the quiet and beautiful surroundings, owning country houses in La Molina became a trend for high class people. This resulted in the populating of the first neighbours, individuals with high incomes. \nFinally, on February 6, 1962, La Molina district was officially created by Act No. 13981 during the Manuel Prado Ugarteche government.\n\nSome members of the community are active members in \"Un techo para mi pais\" which helps people in need build houses. TECHO\n\nLa Molina is a residential district, largely high class, in which the urbanizations La Planicie, El Sol de La Molina, Rinconada, La Molina Vieja, Club Campestre Las Lagunas, Camacho, and in upper middle class stand out, such as Santa Patricia and Las ViÃ±as. La Molina is identified as one of the districts where there is no extreme poverty.\nLa Molina has six large clearly identified sectors:\n\nCamacho: It is an area located to the west of the district, in which exclusive family houses are located. It is made up of the urbanizations of Camacho; which is very visited by residents of the same district for its striking shopping centers, Santa SofÃ­a Magdalena, the La Fontana urbanization, part of Cerros de Camacho (shared with Groove) and the Monterrico Residential. This area borders the Surco district (Monterrico) and the Ate district (Salamanca). It is crossed by Las Palmeras Avenue, Javier Prado Avenue and Los Frutales Avenue. It makes up 15% of the district.\nLa Molina Vieja: It is the southern part of the district. In La Molina Vieja there are exclusive houses that are located in the urbanizations La Molina Vieja, La Alameda de la Molina Vieja, Los Sirius and El Remanso, Corregidor, here you can also find the Faculty of Law and Medicine of the San Martin de Porres University There are also the Isla del Sol, Las ViÃ±as de La Molina, Portada del Sol, La Capilla (Pro-Housing Association Vemtracom Association), La Molina Valley and Las Lomas de la Molina Vieja urbanizations. Make up 20% of the district\nSanta Patricia: It is located north of the district, borders the district of Ate (Mayorazgo) and is inhabited mostly by middle-class sectors in high density. It is made up of the quadrant between La Molina Avenue, Melgarejo Avenue, Industrial Separator Avenue and La Universidad Avenue, and includes urbanizations such as Covima and Santa Raquel. It is the largest area of the district. In this one there are centers of higher studies, among them: San Ignacio de Loyola, and Instituto San Ignacio de Loyola. As well as renowned private schools: Jean le Boulch, Antonio Raimondi, Our Lady of Guide, Virgin of the Rosary of Yungay, Bruning, among others. Although it is a residential area, it also develops trade in avenues such as Melgarejo, Los Constructores, Flora TristÃ¡n and Javier Prado, especially in regards to restaurants. It is the most visually picturesque urbanization, since important architectural works are found, such as the main headquarters of the Mormon Church (made entirely of white marble) and the main headquarters of the Banco de CrÃ©dito del PerÃº, which is built on a reforested hill.\nThe Agrarian University La Molina: it is located in the middle of the district. Due to this university and its large green areas, La Molina is considered an ecological district.\nRinconada Alta, Rinconada Baja, Rinconada del Lago, La Planicie, El Sol de La Molina, Huertos de La Molina and Club Campestre Las Lagunas: In these urbanizations, the population density is very low. This sector begins in Molicentro and is crossed by La Molina Avenue and ElÃ­as Aparicio Avenue. It conforms 20% of the district. Within the Club Campestre Las Lagunas urbanization there are 2 artificial lagoons called Laguna Chica and Laguna Grande. You cannot enter the Laguna Chica because it is surrounded by houses, but you can enter the Laguna Grande. There you can visit it. It also has an island where meetings are held.\nMusa: It is located east of the district and borders the district of Pachacamac (Huertos de Manchay) and Cieneguilla. It is a popular area and was formed as a housing cooperative for workers of the National Agrarian University La Molina, SIPA, Municipality of La Molina and La Arenera. It is located in the last blocks of Avenida La Molina or Carretera towards Cieneguilla. It is estimated that it makes up approximately 5% of the district.\nLa Molina is a district with a profusion of large constructions for the same reason that, several important exclusive Peruvian social clubs have a headquarters in this district, among them:\n\nLa Rinconada Country Club\nLa Planicie Country Club\nIt is the district of Lima with the highest density of green areas, reaching up to 20 mÂ² (square meters) for each inhabitant. In the south of La Molina, on the slopes of the San Pedro, Media Luna and San Francisco hills is the La Molina Ecological Park, which houses 208.6 ha (hectares), and was established on May 12, 2004. Already It has been arborizing with certain species of trees and plants for which sowing campaigns are carried out from time to time. This will be the largest ecological park in Lima. It has more than 13,000 plants between trees and shrubs.\n\nIt also houses important private cemeteries, such as La Planicie Cemetery and Jardines de la Paz Cemetery Park.\n\nLa Molina district is divided into middle, middle-high and upper class suburbs.\n\nLa Molina is best known for the large and luxurious houses that give shape to expensive properties located in suburbs like La Planicie, Rinconada, Las Lagunas, Camacho, Residential Monterrico, La Molina Vieja, Alameda de la Molina Vieja, Los Sirius, Corregidor, El Remanso and Huertos de La Molina. \nNumerous Peruvian celebrities, leading business people and political figures live in these suburbs. Due to their relative safety, calm and low population density, these suburbs are highly valued real estate. \nFurthermore, some of the most exclusive Peruvian social clubs are located in the area: , and .\n\nSanta Felicia, Santa Raquel, Covima, Santa Patricia, La Ensenada, La Capilla, Las Acacias, Los Ingenieros, Pablo Bonner, Pablo CÃ¡nepa, La Fontana and Farwest compose the middle and middle-high class area in the district. They compose the largest part of the district. \nSome suburbs (Santa Patricia, Santa Felicia, Santa Raquel and Covima) used to belong to the neighbouring district of Ate, but they were won over by La Molina. The process was led by the desire of the residents.\n\nMUSA is a special case. It started as a human settlement, but after a great effort and the help of La Molina Government, they achieved the awarding of their properties.\n\nLa Molina faces an accessibility problem because the and RaÃºl Ferrero avenues serve as the only roads that connect this district with the rest of the city of Lima, and thus become overloaded during peak hours.\nModern enterprise buildings, shopping malls and private universities are found in La Molina. An intense urbanizing process has turned La Molina into an example of development and progress for the country.\n\nOn Av. Raul Ferrero is located the principal mall of the district, called \"Molina Plaza\", one of the most important commercial centres of Lima. It was inaugurated in 2005 and belongs to the . This mall helped the commercial evolution of this important avenue where nowadays are found premium restaurants, bars and boutiques.\n\nIn education, many of the upper class private schools in Lima are located in La Molina, including Newton College, Colegio Waldorf-Lima, Frankin D. Roosevelt School, Peruvian North American Abraham Lincoln School, , , Colegio Alpamayo, Colegio Antonio Raimondi, Reina de los Ãngeles School, Villa Caritas, San Pedro School, Peruvian-German School Reina del Mundo, Colegio Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Lord Byron School, Colegio Altair, La Molina Christian Schools, etc. \nSeveral universities are located in La Molina as well, including Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Universidad Femenina del Sagrado CorazÃ³n (UNIFE) and Universidad de San MartÃ­n de Porres.\n\nhttps://larepublica.pe/politica/1333369-molina-alvaro-paz-barra-virtual-alcalde-boca-urna-ipsos-elecciones-municipales-2018\nCatholic Churches - Mass Services\n"}
{"id": "1927897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927897", "title": "Grammatischer Wechsel", "text": "Grammatischer Wechsel\n\nIn historical linguistics, the German term (\"grammatical alternation\") refers to the effects of Verner's law when they are viewed synchronically within the paradigm of a Germanic verb.\n\nAccording to Grimm's law, the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) voiceless stops *p, *t, *k and *kÊ· usually became Proto-Germanic *f, *Î¸ (dental fricative), *x and *xÊ· (velar fricative). Karl Verner identified the principle that these instead become the voiced consonants *b, *d, *g, *gÊ· if they were word-internal and immediately preceded by an unaccented vowel in PIE. Furthermore, PIE *s, which usually came into Germanic unchanged, became *z in this position; Proto-Germanic *z later became North- and West Germanic *r.\n\nConsequently, five pairs of consonants emerged, each pair representing a single PIE phoneme. The following table shows the precise developments from Proto-Indo-European through Proto-Germanic and West Germanic to Old English, Old High German and Middle Dutch. It is mainly in the dentals that these languages show significant differences in the patterns of \". Note that this table lists only the outcome of word-internal consonants, since word-initial consonants were generally not affected by Verner's law.\n\nIn Old English, the fricatives took the voiced allophones , and when they were word-internal, and in Middle Dutch also when word-initial; see: Pronunciation of English â¨thâ©. In Old High German, the stops were moved according to the High German consonant shift. In Dutch, the idiosyncrasies of this shift mean that Dutch (like German) experiences the shift Ã¾âd but (like English) does not experience the shift dât; thus the dental variety of \" is eliminated in Dutch by the normal operation of sound laws. Likewise, and merged in almost all Germanic languages (except Gothic and German), eliminating this variety early on. In Old Norse, and likewise merged altogether.\n\n\" is the phenomenon that a verb which in PIE had a stem ending in one of these phonemes displays a differing reflex in different parts of the paradigm, a result of the movable nature of accent in PIE. The Germanic past tense derives from the PIE perfect aspect, which was always athematic and therefore almost always had a shift of accent between the singular indicative (where it was on the root syllable) and the remaining forms including the past participle (where it was on the ending). However, the perfect aspect was only present in primary, underived verbs, and any derived verbs therefore lacked perfect forms altogether. These latter verbs formed the base of the Germanic weak verbs, and did not inherit the accent shift, so the alternation itself only affects Germanic strong verbs.\n\nA process of levelling has meant that there are only few examples of this in the modern languages. In East and North Germanic, this levelling was almost complete before the earliest records, though Gothic and Old Norse did have traces of \". In Old English, too, the levelling had already begun to the extent that in some verbs the preterite singular had taken the consonant of the preterite plural. The only surviving example in Modern English is \"was:were\", but a trace can also be seen in the adjective \"forlorn\", which reflects the old participle of the verb \"to lose\", or \"sodden\", which is originally a participle of \"seethe\". This latter is parallelled by German \"sieden, sott, gesotten\". German also features d:t in \"leiden, litt, gelitten\" (\"to suffer\") and \"schneiden, schnitt, geschnitten\" (\"to cut\"). One example of h:g is \"ziehen, zog, gezogen\" (\"to pull\"). All other cases have been levelled. Apart from the English copula mentioned above, the only occurrences of s:r in the modern languages are in Dutch: for example \"verliezen, verloor, verloren\" (\"to lose\") and \"verkiezen, verkoos, verkoren\" (\"to choose\").\n\nSome examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNB. Not all consonant apophony in Germanic verbs is caused by '. The consonant alternation in certain weak verbs which typically goes along with the ' phenomenon (\"think:thought\", German \"denken:dachte\") is a result of a later development in Germanic known as the Germanic spirant law. Likewise, the terminal devoicing which produces a fortis-lenis alternation in Dutch (\"wrijven:wreef\") is an unrelated historical phenomenon.\n\nIn PIE, causative verbs (meaning \"to cause to\") were derived from verb roots with a suffix *\"-Ã©ye-\", and the root vowel was changed to the \"o\"-grade. Verbs with this suffix eventually became part of the first weak class (*\"-jan\" verbs). This suffix always bore the accent, and the verb root never did, while in regular strong verbs the verb root was accented in the present tense. This caused Verner alternation between the original verbs and the causative verbs derived from them.\n\nExamples are numerous in the older languages but are less frequent today, because some levelling has occurred, and in some cases, one verb or the other was lost.\n\n\"heffen\" (\"to lift/raise\", from the strong verb *\"habjanÄ\") - \"hebben\" (\"to have\", from the weak verb *\"habjanÄ\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term \"\" was originally applied to any pair of etymologically-related words that had different accent placement, including also Proto-Indo-European athematic nouns. The alternations in nouns were largely eliminated early on in Germanic, but a few cases exist of parallel forms being still preserved in different Germanic languages (such as English \"glass\" and Icelandic \"gler\", an example of the s-z alternation). No attested language, old or modern, shows any alternation in noun paradigms, however.\n"}

The Berlei brand originated in 1917. Berlei undergarments are now sold in Australia by Pacific Brands and in the United Kingdom by Courtaulds Textiles.\n\nBerlei conducted a research project to quantify Australian 'figure types'.\n\nThe name came from that of the firm's founder, Frederick Richard Burley, who felt that his name as normally spelt was not contextually appropriate to his products.\n\nBerlei Limited was one of the first Australian companies to expand outside Australia. Berlei (New Zealand) Limited was incorporated in 1923, and Berlei (U.K.) Limited was organised in 1930.\n\nFrederick R. Burley (29 May 1885, Hamilton, Victoria â 26 May 1954, Wahroonga, New South Wales) was the founder of Berlei.\n\nBurley was a pioneer in employee relations and an accomplished public citizen, holding office in the Rotary Club and contributing to other worthy organizations. In the custom of Rotary he would introduce himself to other clubs with his name, his club, and his occupation as a \"maker of jewel caskets\".\n\nIn 1923, he founded the Australia Made Preference League and served as the first president of the League. The League created the Great White Train as a promotional tool for early Australian industries.\n\nHe travelled widely to learn business and trade information, to make business partnerships, and to get materials for his factories.\n\nThe movie \"Undercover\" was made about the early years of the Berlei company and the life of Frederick R Burley.\nBerlei Limited was started in 1910, as a company called Unique Corsets in Sydney, after Fred Burley discovered that the corset business was profitable and that the wholesale segment of the business could be prosecuted on an import replacement basis. Burley made his first overseas business trip to the US in 1913, to research methods and investigate the use of machinery of the time. The 'frenchified' brand name of Berlei was conceptualized soon after and was registered in Australia in 1917. (While this might reasonably be accordingly pronounced after the French style as 'bur-LAY', it is commonly still pronounced as if written 'burley'.) United Corsets became Berlei Limited in 1920.\n\nThe original factory was in Wilmot Street, Sydney with additional space being used in Liverpool Street.\n\nIn January 1922, the factory was moved to Berlei House in Regent Street.\n\nFred Burley's vision for the company was \"To Design and Manufacture Corsets and Brassieres of such perfect Fit, Quality, and Workmanship, as will bring pleasure and profit to all concerned, while at the same time rendering such excellent service to our Clients and Consumers as will merit their permanent patronage\".\n\nBerlei's approach to marketing was professional.\n\nBerlei (New Zealand) Limited was started in 1923, with a staff of fifty growing to 665 employees in 1961.\n\nBendon Berlei Limited merged with Ceramco Apparel Group Limited on 8 April 1981.\n\nA branch of the Australian company was opened in the United Kingdom in 1930, with staff of forty.

It was established in 1931 and ran until the end of 1939 with a hiatus from 1933â34, and awarded points to drivers based on the results of selected Grand Prix races, the so-called \"Grandes Ãpreuves\" (this term had been used for the most prestigious races since the 1920s; the only \"Grande Ãpreuve\" to be excluded from the championship was the 1931 German Grand Prix). The championship was discontinued because of the outbreak of World War II in 1939, and no champion was officially declared for the last season.\n\nThe championship was run by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (AIACR), the forerunner to the FIA who are today's world governing body of motorsport.\n\nThe 1931 and 1932 seasons were run to existing Formula Libre regulations, with a minimum car weight of 900Â kg. The calendar consisted of the Italian Grand Prix, the French Grand Prix and the Belgian Grand Prix/German Grand Prix.\n\nIn 1934, the AIACR introduced a maximum weight limit of 750Â kg for Grand Prix cars. Already in 1933, new chancellor Adolf Hitler had announced that he would provide 450,000Â reichsmarks to German companies to build Grand Prix cars. Eventually, the money was split between bidders, Mercedes-Benz and the newly formed Auto Union. Auto Union took over the P-Wagen concept of Ferdinand Porsche and put the engine behind the driver. Both German manufacturers proved dominant in nearly all races they entered. These cars proved to be the bases for the two companies entries in the first year of the European Championship. Other entries came from manufacturers including Alfa Romeo, whose team were being run by Scuderia Ferrari, Maserati, and Bugatti.\n\nThe 750Â kg formula lasted until the end of 1937. By then, the German cars had over 600Â hp, more than twice the rule makers had expected to be possible with that weight limit. For 1938, a new formula was introduced, limiting also engine sizes. Cars with a supercharger were permitted to have an engine size between 666Â cc and 3000Â cc, whereas normally aspirated cars were allowed between 1000Â cc and 4500Â cc. The cars had to weigh between 400Â kg and 850Â kg; the exact minimum weight specified in the regulations was dependent on a car's engine capacity and followed a linear scale.\nAt the AIACR's end of season meeting towards the end of 1938, it was expressed that some were not content using the then current points system. Belgium's representative, Mr. Langlois, was asked to come up with an alternative system for 1939. Langlois took several months to propose a new system and there is no evidence to suggest that the previous scoring system was rescinded.\n\nIn 1939, war broke out and the AIACR could not meet to publish an official set of championship results. Hermann Lang was declared European champion by KorpsfÃ¼hrer Adolf HÃ¼hnlein of the NSKK, who was also president of Germany's highest racing organisation, Oberste Nationale SportbehÃ¶rde fÃ¼r die Deutsche Kraftfahrt. HÃ¼hnlein's declaration was published as a statement in the VÃ¶lkischer Beobachter, the official Nazi Party newsletter.

It is the second of three lighthouses that have been built on Bald Head Island since the 19th century to help guide ships past the dangerous shoals at the mouth of the Cape Fear river.\n\nA site on the west side of Bald Head Island, along the banks of the Cape Fear River, was selected for North Carolina's first lighthouse. The property was purchased from Benjamin Smith, who would later become the governor of North Carolina. In 1792, Congress appropriated $4,000 to complete the lighthouse that had been started by the North Carolina Colony before becoming part of the United States. Work on the lighthouse was overseen by Abisha Woodward, who would later build five lighthouses along the Connecticut coast and one in New York on the east end of Long Island, two of which still stand at New London, and Falkner's Island. The lighthouse, which was first activated on December 23, 1794, directed traffic to the Cape Fear River and the growing port of Wilmington, located several miles upstream. In less than two decades this lighthouse was threatened due to severe erosion of the river bank. Between 1813 and 1817 funds were approved for rebuilding Bald Head Lighthouse.\n\nThe replacement lighthouse now known as \"Old Baldy\" was completed by 1817. Old Baldy was built further inland where it would not be threatened by shifting sands along the river for just under $16,000 using bricks salvaged from the old tower. A stone plaque above the entrance identifies the builder as Daniel S. Way, and the foundry for the lantern room, that was also salvaged from the old tower, as R. Cochran. The octagonal brick tower is coated with stucco and stands high, the exterior was originally whitewashed and later painted white. At its base, the tower is wide and at its top wide, while the walls are thick at the base and taper to at the top. The rectangular stairway leading up the inside of the tower is made of Carolina yellow pine. The lantern room sits on top of one of the tower support beams which makes it offset from the center of the tower. Old Baldy was originally equipped with an array of 15 lamps and reflectors, and as technology improved, it later housed a Fresnel lens.\n\nOld Baldy was first lit in 1817 by keeper, Sedgwick Springs, a veteran of the American Revolution and owner of the nearby Sedgely Abbey Plantation. He had been appointed to the position in 1806 at the behest of US President Thomas Jefferson and served as the light keeper at Bald Head for more than 30 years. The Bald Head Lighthouse soon proved to be inadequate especially during bad weather.\n\nOn July 1, 1834, Capt. Henry D. Hunter of the revenue cutter \"Taney\" inspected Bald Head Light which he described as having 15 lamps, 109 feet above the level of the sea, showing a fixed light. Two years later in 1836 he again inspected the light station. \"The keeper is an old revolutionary soldier,\" he reported \"and is unable from sickness to give the lighthouse his constant personal attention. The light, however, shows well from a distance.\" Keeper Springs was eighty years old at the time of the report and died the following year after being in charge of the Bald Head lighthouse for more than thirty years.\n\nSome problems with the Bald Head Lighthouse included its location as well as its inadequate height and illumination. Positioned some four miles from the eastern end of the island and equipped with a minor light, the lighthouse was unsuccessful in guiding ships safely past Frying Pan Shoals especially during storms and fog. A lightship was therefore placed out on the shoals in 1854. \n\nA Jones fog bell was placed near Bald Head Lighthouse in 1855. In the same year the Lighthouse Board recommended improving the light by replacing the original apparatus with a third-order Fresnel lens. It also recommended a fixed light, varied by flashes \"to distinguish this light, under all circumstances, from Federal Point Light.\"\n\nIn 1866 Bald Head Light was discontinued after a new lighthouse was built at the mouth of the Cape Fear River to replace the screw pile Federal Point Light that had been destroyed by Confederate troops during the Civil War. In 1880, however, Federal Point Light had been rendered useless and was discontinued because of the closing of the New Inlet Channel by the Engineer Department. Bald Head Light was relighted at that time and, together with a small stake light on the beach in front of it, served as a guide through the 16- to 18-foot Oak Island Channel across the bar.\n\nRequests for funds to increase the height of Old Baldy and install a more powerful first-order lens to make it a coastal beacon, as had been done at Cape Hatteras in 1854 and Tybee Island in 1866, were never approved. Instead, in 1898 the Lighthouse Board approved the construction a new 184-foot cast iron skeleton tower equipped with a first order lens named the Cape Fear Lighthouse, to be located on the southeastern end of Bald Head Island, where it could mark the shoals. The Cape Fear Light served as a coastal beacon from 1903 to 1958.\n\nAfter the construction of the Cape Fear Lighthouse, Old Baldy continued to serve as an active lighthouse with a fourth-order fixed beacon until 1935, and it housed a radio beacon until 1958. It was used mostly to help guide ships into the mouth of the Cape Fear River. After the construction of the Oak Island Lighthouse in 1958, Old Baldy and the Cape Fear Lighthouse were both decommissioned. The Cape Fear lighthouse was demolished but Old Baldy still stands as a day beacon and symbol of Bald Head Island. The lighthouse has been restored and is open to the public.\n\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as Bald Head Island Lighthouse.\n\nIn 1995 Jacob Arthur, grandson of Charlie Frank House, Jr. (a contributor to the lighthouse's restoration and preservation) unveiled the plaque that stands in the foyer today. This plaque commemorated the re-opening of the Old Baldy Lighthouse after years of renovations.\n\n\nThe Old Baldy Foundation operates Old Baldy and the adjacent Smith Island Museum of History, which is located in a replica of one of the original lighthouse keeper's quarters from the 1850s and features period furnishings, lighthouse artifacts including parts of the lens from the Cape Fear Lighthouse, and exhibits about the history of Old Baldy and the island.\n\nWhen Hurricane Fran struck the southern North Carolina coast on September 5, 1996, there were a few residents remaining on Bald Head Island. When wind speeds climbed past hurricane strength, some islanders fled their houses and sought shelter inside the Bald Head Lighthouse. The lighthouse suffered minimal damage. It is possibly one of the safest structures on the island; its construction of brick and plaster five feet thick has weathered many storms and is now known to withstand at least Category 3 hurricanes.\n\n"}

It stood near the cape on Bald Head Island. It was a steel octagonal pyramidal skeleton frame lighthouse, as opposed to the conical brick lighthouses usually associated with the state. It was painted red and white horizontal stripes: three white and two red and housed a first-order Fresnel lens produced by the Henry-LePaute Company in France. \n\nIn August 1906, the upper part of the tower above the columns was changed from white to black to provide a more conspicuous day beacon. In 1915, $35,000 was requested to disassemble and move the tower and dwellings to the site of Bald Head Lighthouse, as it was believed that shoreline erosion would soon endanger the structures. Apparently the erosion ceased because the funding request was not repeated and the keepers dwellings still stand today on their original location near the concrete foundation blocks that once supported the lighthouse. \n\nThe Cape Fear Light was maintained for more than half of its life by Capt. Charlie Swan, its lighthouse keeper. On December 5, 1932, first assistant lighthouse keeper, Devaney F. Jennette, died of a heart attack while in the watch room. He had just climbed the tower and was talking to Capt. Swan at the time. The Cape Fear Lighthouse was replaced in 1958 by the powerful Oak Island Lighthouse. The Cape Fear lighthouse was then demolished because it was believed that if the deactivated tower remained standing it could confuse mariners. \n\nWhen the lighthouse was demolished the Coast Guard in an unusual move gave the first order Fresnel lens from the Cape Fear lighthouse to the demolition contractor. The intact lens ended up at an antique store in Wilmington where the prisms and glass panels were sold off piece by piece over the next 50 years. In 2009 what was left of the lens was acquired by the Old Baldy Foundation and returned to Bald Head island for restoration. Several of the glass prisms and panels from the lens that were sold off over the years have been returned to Bald Head Island. The Old Baldy Foundation plans to display the restored lens near the former site of the Cape Fear Lighthouse.\n\nThe Cape Fear Lighthouse Complex, also known as Cap'n Charlie's Cottages still stands, it consists of a row of three detached light keepers' houses and a supply shed and the piers of another shed. They were constructed in 1903, along with the lighthouse.\n\nThe complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\n"}

{"id": "1927935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927935", "title": "Daeva", "text": "Daeva\n\nDaeva (Avestan: ð¬ð¬ð¬ð¬ð¬ð¬ \"daÄuua\") is an Avestan language term for a particular sort of supernatural entity with disagreeable characteristics. In the Gathas, the oldest texts of the Zoroastrian canon, the \"daeva\"s are \"gods that are (to be) rejected\". This meaning is â subject to interpretation â perhaps also evident in the Old Persian \"\"daiva\" inscription\" of the 5th century BCE. In the \"Younger Avesta\", the \"daeva\"s are divinities that promote chaos and disorder. In later tradition and folklore, the \"dÄw\"s (Zoroastrian Middle Persian; New Persian \"div\"s) are personifications of every imaginable evil.\n\n\"Daeva\", the Iranian language term, shares the same origin of \"Deva\" of Indian mythology, later incorporated into Indian religions. While the word for the Vedic spirits and the word for the Zoroastrian entities are etymologically related, their function and thematic development is altogether different. Originally, the term was used to denote beings of cultural folklore which predate use in scripture.\n\nEquivalents for Avestan \"daeva\" in Iranian languages include Pashto, Balochi, Kurdish \"dÃªw\", Persian \"dÄ«v\"/\"deev\", all of which apply to ogres, monsters, and other villainous creatures. The Iranian word was borrowed into Old Armenian as \"dew\", Georgian as \"devi\", Urdu as \"deo\", and Turkish as \"div\" with the same negative associations in those languages. In English, the word appears as \"daeva\", \"div\", \"deev\", and in the 18th century fantasy novels of William Thomas Beckford as \"dive\".\n\nIt has been speculated that the concept of the daevas as a malevolent force may have been inspired from the Scythian gods.\n\nOld Avestan \"daÄuua\" or \"daÄva\" derives from Old Iranian \"*daiva\", which in turn derives from Indo-Iranian \"*daivÃ¡-\" \"god\", reflecting Proto-Indo-European \"*deywÃ³s\" with the same meaning. For other Indo-European derivatives, see Dyeus. The Vedic Sanskrit cognate of Avestan \"daÄuua\" is \"devÃ¡-\", continuing in later Indo-Aryan languages as \"dev\".\n\nBecause all cognates of Iranian \"*daiva\" have a positive connotation, but \"no known Iranian dialect attests clearly and certainly the survival of a positive sense for [Old Iranian] \"*daiva-\"\", in the 19th- and 20th-century a great deal of academic discussion revolved around questions of how Iranian \"daeva\" might have gained its derogatory meaning. This \"fundamental fact of Iranian linguistics\" is \"impossible\" to reconcile with the testimony of the Gathas, where the \"daeva\"s, though rejected, were still evidently gods that continued to have a following. The same is true of the \"daiva\" inscription, where the \"daiva\" are the gods of (potential) rebels, but still evidently gods that continued to have a following.\n\nThe issue is related to the question of how Zoroaster's own contribution to Iranian religion might be defined. In the older early/mid 20th-century view (so-called reform hypothesis), in which Zoroaster was perceived to be a revolutionary reformer, it was assumed that the \"daeva\"s must have been the \"national\" gods (see comparison with Indic usage, below) of pre-Zoroaster-ian Iran, which Zoroaster had then rejected. This attribution to Zoroaster is also found in the 9th/10th-century books of Zoroastrian tradition, and Gershevitch and others following Lommel consider the progression from \"national\" gods to demons to be attributable to the \"genius of Zoroaster\". Subsequent scholarship (so-called progressive hypothesis) has a more differentiated view of Zoroaster, and does not follow the unprovable assumption that prehistoric Iranian religion ever had \"national\" gods (and thus also that the \"daeva\"s could have represented such a group), nor does it involve hypothetical conjecture of whose gods the \"daeva\"s might/might not have been. While the progressive hypothesis gives Zoroaster credit for giving Iranian religion a moral and ethical dimension, it does not (with one notable exception) give Zoroaster credit for the development of the \"daeva\"s into demons. It assumes that the development was gradual, and that a general distrust of the \"daeva\"s already existed by the time the Gathas were composed.\n\nAlthough with some points of comparison such as shared etymology, Indic \"devÃ¡-\" is thematically different from Avestan \"daÄva\".\n\nWhile in the post-Rigvedic Indic texts the conflict between the two groups of \"deva\"s and \"asuras\" is a primary theme, this is not a theme in either the Rigveda nor in the Iranian texts,\n\nand therefore cannot have been a feature of a common heritage. The use of \"asura\" in the Rigveda is unsystematic and inconsistent and \"it can hardly be said to confirm the existence of a category of gods opposed to the \"deva\"s\". Indeed, RigVedic \"deva\" is variously applied to most gods, including many of the \"asura\"s. Likewise, at the oldest layer, Zoroastrianism's \"daeva\"s are originally also gods (albeit gods to be rejected), and it is only in the younger texts that the word evolved to refer to evil creatures. And the Zoroastrian \"ahura\"s (etymologically related to the Vedic \"asura\"s) are also only vaguely defined, and only three in number.\n\nMoreover, the daemonization of the \"asura\"s in India and the daemonization of the \"daeva\"s in Iran both took place \"so late that the associated terms cannot be considered a feature of Indo-Iranian religious dialectology\". The view popularized by Nyberg, Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin, and Widengren of a prehistorical opposition of \"*asura/daiva\" involves \"interminable and entirely conjectural discussions\" on the status of various Indo-Iranian entities that in one culture are \"asura\"s/\"ahura\"s and in the other are \"deva\"s/\"daeva\"s (see examples in the Younger Avesta, below).\n\nIn the Gathas, the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and credited to Zoroaster himself, the \"daeva\"s are not yet the demons that they would become in later Zoroastrianism; though their rejection is notable in the Gathas themselves. The Gathas speak of the \"daeva\"s as a group, and do not mention individual \"daeva\"s by name. In these ancient texts, the term \"daeva\"s (also spelled 'daÄuuas') occurs 19 times; wherein \"daeva\"s are a distinct category of \"quite genuine gods, who had, however, been rejected\". In \"Yasna\" 32.3 and 46.1, the \"daeva\"s are still worshipped by the Iranian peoples. \"Yasna\" 32.8 notes that some of the followers of Zoroaster had previously been followers of the \"daeva\"s; though, the \"daeva\"s are clearly identified with evil (e.g., \"Yasna\" 32.5).\n\nIn the Gathas, \"daeva\"s are censured as being incapable of discerning truth (\"asha-\") from falsehood (\"druj-\"). They are consequently in \"error\" (\"aÄnah-\"), but are never identified as \"drÉguuaá¹t-\" \"people of the lie\". The conclusion drawn from such ambiguity is that, at the time the Gathas were composed, \"the process of rejection, negation, or daemonization of these gods was only just beginning, but, as the evidence is full of gaps and ambiguities, this impression may be erroneous\". \n\nIn Yasna 32.4, the \"daeva\"s are revered by the \"Usij\", described as a class of \"false priests\", devoid of goodness of mind and heart, and hostile to cattle and husbandry (\"Yasna\" 32.10â11, 44.20). Like the \"daeva\"s that they follow, \"the \"Usij\" are known throughout the seventh region of the earth as the offspring of \"aka mainyu,\" \"druj,\" and arrogance. (\"Yasna\" 32.3)\". \"Yasna\" 30.6 suggests the \"daeva\"-worshipping priests debated frequently with Zoroaster, but failed to persuade him.\n\nIn the Younger Avesta, the \"daeva\"s are unambiguously hostile entities. In contrast, the word \"daevayasna-\" (literally, \"one who sacrifices to \"daeva\"s\") denotes adherents of other religions and thus still preserves some semblance of the original meaning in that the \"daeva-\" prefix still denotes \"other\" gods. In \"Yasht\" 5.94 however, the \"daevayasna-\" are those who sacrifice to Anahita during the hours of darkness, i.e., the hours when the \"daeva\"s lurk about, and \"daevayasna-\" appears then to be an epithet applied to those who deviate from accepted practice and/or harvested religious disapproval.\n\nThe \"Vendidad\", a contraction of \"vi-daevo-dÄta\", \"given against the \"daeva\"s\", is a collection of late Avestan texts that deals almost exclusively with the \"daeva\"s, or rather, their various manifestations and with ways to confound them. \"Vi.daeva-\" \"rejecting the \"daeva\"s\" qualifies the faithful Zoroastrian with the same force as \"mazdayasna-\" ('Mazda worshiper').\n\nIn \"Vendidad\" 10.9 and 19.43, three divinities of the Vedic pantheon follow Angra Mainyu in a list of demons: Completely adapted to Iranian phonology, these are \"Indra\" (Vedic Indra), Sarva (Vedic Sarva, i.e. Rudra), and Nanghaithya (Vedic Nasatya). The process by which these three came to appear in the Avesta is uncertain. Together with three other \"daeva\"s, Tauru, Zairi and Nasu, that do not have Vedic equivalents, the six oppose the six Amesha Spentas.\n\n\"Vendidad\" 19.1 and 19.44 have Angra Mainyu dwelling in the region of the \"daeva\"s which the \"Vendidad\" sets in the north and/or the nether world (\"Vendidad \" 19.47, \"Yasht\" 15.43), a world of darkness. In Vendidad 19.1 and 19.43â44, Angra Mainyu is the \"daevanam daevo\", \"\"daeva\" of \"daeva\"s\" or chief of the \"daeva\"s. The superlative \"daevo.taema\" is however assigned to the demon Paitisha (\"opponent\"). In an enumeration of the \"daeva\"s in Vendidad 1.43, Angra Mainyu appears first and Paitisha appears last. \"Nowhere is Angra Mainyu said to be the creator of the \"daeva\"s or their father.\"\n\nThe \"Vendidad\" is usually recited after nightfall since the last part of the day is considered to be the time of the demons. Because the \"Vendidad\" is the means to disable them, this text is said to be effective only when recited between sunset and sunrise.\n\nOld Persian \"daiva\" occurs twice in Xerxes' \"daiva inscription\" (XPh, early 5th century BCE). This trilingual text also includes one reference to a \"daivadana\" \"house of the \"daiva\"s\", generally interpreted to be a reference to a shrine or sanctuary.\n\nIn his inscription, Xerxes records that \"by the favour of Ahura Mazda I destroyed that establishment of the daivas and I proclaimed, 'The daivas thou shalt not worship!'\" This statement has been interpreted either one of two ways. Either the statement is an ideological one and \"daiva\"s were gods that were to be rejected, or the statement was politically motivated and \"daiva\"s were gods that were followed by (potential) enemies of the state.\n\nIn the Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition, the \"dew\"s are invariably rendered with the Aramaic ideogram \"Å DYA\" or the more common plural \"Å DYAÊ¼n\" that signified \"demons\" even in the singular.\n\n\"Dew\"s play a crucial role in the cosmogonic drama of the \"Bundahishn\", a Zoroastrian view of creation completed in the 12th century. In this text, the evil spirit \"Ahriman\" (the middle Persian equivalent of Avestan Angra Mainyu) creates his hordes of \"dew\"s to counter the creation of \"Ormuzd\" (Avestan Ahura Mazda). This notion is already alluded to in the \"Vendidad\" (see \"Younger Avestan\" texts above), but only properly developed in the \"Bundahishn\". In particular, Ahriman is seen to create six \"dew\"s that in Zoroastrian tradition are the antitheses of the \"Amahraspand\"s (Avestan Amesha Spentas).\n\nMirroring the task of the Amesha Spentas through which Ahura Mazda realized creation, the six antitheses are the instrument through which Angra Mainyu creates all the horrors in the world. Further, the arch-\"daeva\"s of \"Vendidad\" 10.9 and 19.43 are identified as the antithetical counterparts of the Amesha Spentas. The six arch-demons as listed in the \"Epistles of Zadspram\" (WZ 35.37) and the \"Greater Bundahishn\" (GBd. 34.27) are:\nThese oppositions differ from those found in scripture, where the moral principles (that each Amesha Spenta represents) are opposed by immoral principles. This is not however a complete breach, for while in the Gathas \"asha\"âthe principleâis the diametric opposite of the abstract \"druj\", in Zoroastrian tradition, it is \"Ardawahisht\", the Amesha Spenta that is the hypostasis of \"asha\", that is opposed to by Indar, who freezes the minds of creatures from practicing \"righteousness\" (\"asha\").\n\"Greater Bundahishn\" 34.27 adds two more arch-demons, which are not however in opposition to Amesha Spentas:\n\nAlso mirroring Ormuzd's act of creation, i.e., the realization of the Amesha Spentas by his \"thought\", is Ahriman's creation of the \"dew\"s through his \"demonic essence\". Other texts describe this event as being to Ahriman's detriment for his act of \"creation\" is actually an act of destruction. Ahriman is the very epitome (and hypostasis) of destruction, and hence he did not \"create\" the demons, he realized them through destruction, and they then became that destruction. The consequence is that, as Ahriman and the \"dew\"s can only destruct, they will ultimately destroy themselves (\"Denkard\" 3). As the medieval texts also do for Ahriman, they question whether the \"dew\"s exist at all. Since \"existence\" is the domain of Ormuzd, and Ahriman and his \"dew\"s are anti-existence, it followed that Ahriman and his \"dew\"s could not possibly exist. One interpretation of the \"Denkard\" proposes that the \"dew\"s were perceived to be non-existent physically (that is, they were considered non-ontological) but present psychologically. (see also: Ahriman: In Zoroastrian tradition)\n\nFor a different set of texts, such as the \"Shayest ne shayest\" and the \"Book of Arda Wiraz\", Ahriman and the \"dew\"s were utterly real, and are described as being potentially catastrophic. In such less philosophical representations, the \"dew\"s are hordes of devils with a range of individual powers ranging from the almost benign to the most malign. They collectively rush out at nightfall to do their worst, which includes every possible form of corruption at every possible level of human existence. Their destructiveness is evident not only in disease, pain, and grief but also in cosmic events such as falling stars and climatic events such as droughts, cyclones and earthquakes. They are sometimes described as having anthropomorphic properties such as faces and feet, or given animal-like properties such as claws and body hair. They may produce semen, and may even mate with humans as in the tale of \"Jam\" and \"Jamag\" (\"Bundahishn\" 14B.1).\n\nBut with the exception of the \"Book of Arda Wiraz\", the \"dew\"s are not generally described as a force to be feared. With fundamental optimism, the texts describe how the \"dew\"s may be kept in check, ranging from cursing them to the active participation in life through good thoughts, words and deeds. Many of the medieval texts develop ideas already expressed in the \"Vendidad\" (\"given against the demons\").\n\nA fire (cf. \"Adur\") is an effective weapon against the \"dew\"s, and keeping a hearth fire burning is a means to protect the home. The \"dew\"s are \"particularly attracted by the organic productions of human beings, from excretion, reproduction, sex, and death\". Prayer and other recitations of the liturgy, in particular the recitation of \"Yasht\" 1 (so \"Sad-dar\" 57), is effective in keeping the demons at bay. Demons are attracted by chatter at mealtimes and when silence is broken a demon takes the place of the angel at one's side. According to \"Shayest-ne-Shayest\" 9.8, eating at all after nightfall is not advisable since the night is the time of demons. In the 9th century \"rivayat\"s (65.14), the demons are described as issuing out at night to wreak mayhem, but forced back into the underworld by the divine glory (\"khvarenah\") at sunrise.\n\nThe Zoroastrianism of the medieval texts is unambiguous with respect to which force is the superior. Evil cannot create and is hence has a lower priority in the cosmic order (\"asha\"). According to \"Denkard\" 5.24.21a, the protection of the \"yazata\"s is ultimately greater than the power of the demons. The \"dew\"s are agents (\"procurersâ\"vashikano\"âof success\") of Ahriman (Avestan \"Angra Mainyu\") in the contests that will continue until the end of time, at which time the fiend will become invisible and (God's) creatures will become pure. (\"Dadestan-i Denig\" 59)\n\nBut until the final renovation of the world, mankind \"stands between the \"yazad\"s and the \"dÄw\"s; the [\"yazad\"s] are immortal in essence and inseparable from their bodies (\"mÄnÅg\"), men are immortal in essence but separable from their bodies (moving from \"gÄtÄ«g\" to \"mÄnÅg\" condition), but \"dÄw\"s are mortal in essence and inseparable from their bodies, which may be destroyed.\"\n\nIn addition to the six arch-demons (see above) that oppose the six Amesha Spentas, numerous other figures appear in scripture and tradition. According to \"Bundahishn\" XXVII.12, the six arch-demons have cooperators (\"hamkars\"), arranged in a hierarchy (not further specified) similar to that of the \"yazata\"s. These are \"\"dew\"s [...] created by the sins that creatures commit.\" (\"Bundahishn\" XXVII.51)\nOther entities include:\nThe most destructive of these are \"Astiwihad\", the demon of death that casts the noose of mortality around men's necks at birth, and \"Az\", who is most capable of destroying the \"innate wisdom\" of man. \"Az\" is thus the cause of heresy and blinds the righteous man from being able to discern the truth and falsehood.\n\nA list of ten demons is provided in the \"Shahnameh\": Besides the afore-mentioned \"Az\" \"greed\", \"Kashm\" \"wrath\" (Avestan \"Aeshma\"), \"Nang\" \"dishonor\", \"Niaz\" \"want\", and \"Rashk\" \"envy\", the epic poem includes \"Kin\" \"vengeance\", \"Nammam\" \"tell-tale\", \"Do-ruy\" \"two-face\", \"napak-din\" \"heresy\", and (not explicitly named) ungratefulness.\n\nSome of the entities that in the Middle Persian texts are demons, are in the \"Shahnameh\" attributes of demons, for instance, \"varuna\" \"backwards\" or \"inside out\", reflecting that they tend to do the opposite of what they are asked to do.

Located at a distance of 15Â km from Tiruchirappalli, the dam was originally constructed during the reign of Chola king Karikalan in . It is located on Kaveri river approximately 20 KM from Trichy city, the dam comes under Tiruchirappalli district. It is the fourth-oldest water-diversion or water-regulator structures in the world and the oldest in India which is still in use.\n\nThe dam was originally built by King Karikalan of the Chola Dynasty in . It is located on the River in Tiruchirapalli District, approximately 20km from the city of Tiruchirapalli. The idea behind the construction of the dam was to divert the river to the delta districts thereby boosting irrigation. The dam was re-modeled by the British during the 19th century. In 1804, Captain Caldwell, a military engineer, was appointed by the British to make a study on the Kaveri river and promote irrigation for the delta region. He found that a large amount of water passed onto the Kollidam leaving behind a small volume for irrigation purposes. Caldwell initially proposed a solution by raising the dam and hence raised the dam stones to a height of , thus increasing the capacity of the dam. Following this, Major Sim proposed the idea of undersluices across the river with outlets leading to the Kollidam River (Coleroon) thus preventing formation of silt. The Lower Anaicut built by Sir Arthur Cotton in the 19th century CE across Coleroon, the major tributary of Cauvery, is said to be a replicated structure of Kallanai.\n\nThe Kaveri river splits into two at a point west of Kallanai. The two rivers form the island of Srirangam before joining at Kallanai. The northern channel is called the Kollidam (Coleroon); the other retains the name Kaveri, and empties into the Bay of Bengal at Poompuhar. On the seaward face of its delta are the seaports of Nagapattinam and Karaikal.\n\nThe purpose of the Kallanai was to divert the waters of the Kaveri across the fertile delta region for irrigation via canals and to its northern delta branch Kollidam/Coleroon. Downstream of the barrage, the river Kaveri splits into four streams known as Kollidam Aru, Kaveri, Vennaru and Puthu Aru. However, the flood waters can be allowed, by opening the barrage/anaicut gates, to pass through the other three delta branches also to join the sea. It is constructed from unhewn stone spanning the Kaveri and is long, wide and high. The dam is still in excellent condition, and supplied a model to later engineers, including Sir Arthur Cotton's 19th-century dam across the Kollidam, the major tributary of the Kaveri. The area irrigated by the ancient irrigation network is about . By the early 20th century, the irrigated area had been increased to about one million acres (400,000 ha).\n\nThe delta farmers of Tamil Nadu have demanded that the Tamil Nadu government honour Karikala Cholan, who built the Kallanai.\n\n"}

He is the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Oxford.\n\nBen Green was born on 27 February 1977 in Bristol, England. He studied at local schools in Bristol, Bishop Road Primary School and Fairfield Grammar School, competing in the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1994 and 1995. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1995 and completed his BA in mathematics in 1998, winning the Senior Wrangler title. He stayed on for Part III and earned his doctorate under the supervision of English mathematician Timothy Gowers, with a thesis entitled \"Topics in arithmetic combinatorics\" (2003). During his PhD he spent a year as a visiting student at Princeton University. He was a research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge between 2001 and 2005, before becoming a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Bristol from January 2005 to September 2006 and then the first Herchel Smith Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge from September 2006 to August 2013. He became the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Oxford on 1 August 2013. He was also a Research Fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute and held various positions at institutes such as Princeton University, University of British Columbia, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThe majority of Green's research is in the fields of analytic number theory and additive combinatorics, but he also has results in harmonic analysis and in group theory. His most well known theorem, proved jointly with his frequent collaborator Terence Tao, states that there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in the prime numbers: this is now known as the GreenâTao theorem.\n\nAmongst Green's early results in additive combinatorics are an improvement of a result of Jean Bourgain of the size of arithmetic progressions in sumsets, as well as a proof of the CameronâErdÅs conjecture on sum-free sets of natural numbers. He also proved an arithmetic regularity lemma for functions defined on the first formula_1 natural numbers, somewhat analogous to the SzemerÃ©di regularity lemma for graphs.\n\nFrom 2004â2010, in joint work with Terence Tao and Tamar Ziegler, he developed so-called higher order Fourier analysis. This theory relates Gowers norms with objects known as nilsequences. The theory derives its name from these nilsequences, which play an analogous role to the role that characters play in classical Fourier analysis. Green and Tao used higher order Fourier analysis to present a new method for counting the number of solutions to simultaneous equations in certain sets of integers, including in the primes. This generalises the classical approach using Hardy--Littlewood circle method. Many aspects of this theory, including the quantitative aspects of the inverse theorem for the Gowers norms, are still the subject of ongoing research.\n\nGreen has also collaborated with Emmanuel Breuillard on topics in group theory. In particular, jointly with Terence Tao, they proved a structure theorem for approximate groups, generalising the Freiman-Ruzsa theorem on sets of integers with small doubling. Green also has work, joint with Kevin Ford and Sean Eberhard, on the theory of the symmetric group, in particular on what proportion of its elements fix a set of size formula_2.\n\nGreen and Tao also have a paper on algebraic combinatorial geometry, resolving the Dirac-Motzkin conjecture (see SylvesterâGallai theorem). In particular they prove that, given any collection of formula_3 points in the plane that are not all collinear, if formula_3 is large enough then there must exist at least formula_5 lines in the plane containing exactly two of the points.\n\nKevin Ford, Ben Green, Sergei Konyagin, James Maynard and Terence Tao, initially in two separate research groups and then in combination, improved the lower bound for the size of the longest gap between two consecutive primes of size at most formula_6. The form of the previously best-known bound, essentially due to Rankin, had not been improved for 76 years.\n\nMore recently Green has considered questions in arithmetic Ramsey theory. Together with Tom Sanders he proved that, if a sufficiently large finite field of prime order is coloured with a fixed number of colours, then the field has elements formula_7 such that formula_8 all have the same colour.\n\nGreen has also been involved with the new developments of Croot-Lev-Pach-Ellenberg-Gijswijt on applying a polynomial method to bound the size of subsets of a finite vector space without solutions to linear equations. He adapted these methods to prove, in function fields, a strong version of SÃ¡rkÃ¶zy's theorem.\n\nGreen has been a Fellow of the Royal Society since 2010, and a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society since 2012. Green was chosen by the German Mathematical Society to deliver a Gauss Lectureship in 2013. He has received several awards:\n\n\n"}

It is of the post-apocalyptic Italian genre similar to the films \"1990 The Bronx Warriors\" and \"Endgame\". It is set in 2019, after a nuclear apocalypse, and stars a mercenary out to rescue the last fertile woman on Earth. The film starred Michael Sopkiw and Anna Kanakis, and B-movie regular George Eastman. The movie is also known listed the 2019 missing from the title.\n\nThe film was influenced by John Carpenter's \"Escape from New York\".\n\nIn 1999, a war between the Pan-American Confederacy and the Eurac Monarchy (comprising Europe, Africa, and Asia) resulted in a nuclear holocaust. 20 years later, radiation has rendered all remaining humans sterile, and the victorious Euracs have occupied Manhattan and hunt survivors for genetic experiments.Â \n\nAfter winning a motorized deathmatch in Nevada, an ex-Confederate soldier named Parsifal is abducted and taken to the Confederacy's secret base in Alaska. The President of the Confederacy tells him there is a fertile woman somewhere in New York City. He offers Parsifal a place on a Confederate rocketship bound for Alpha Centauri if he can infiltrate the city and retrieve her; otherwise, he will be killed. When Parsifal proposes sending in a cyborg instead, the President reveals the Confederacy eliminated all its cyborgs.\n\nParsifal is accompanied by two Confederate agents, Bronx and Ratchet. After entering Manhattan through the sewers, they are attacked by the Harlem Hunters, a street gang. They escape and come upon the Needle People, a group of scavengers led by the Rat Eater King, preparing to kill a dwarf named Shorty. Parsifal intervenes, and the three agents are captured. Eurac troops raid the scavengersâ hideout and bring Parsifal, Bronx, and Ratchet to their base along with a scavenger girl, Giara.\n\nParsifal escapes and rescues Bronx and Giara. Bronx stays behind and is killed, while Parsifal and Giara are saved by Ratchet. The three escape into the sewers and find refuge in a subterranean dwarf colony with Shorty, who claims to know the location of the fertile woman. The colony is attacked by Euracs using sonic weapons, and Parsifal, Giara, Ratchet, and Shorty flee. They are saved by a group of ape-like mutants, led by Big Ape. When Parsifal explains their mission, Big Ape reveals he is also fertile. That night, Parsifal protects Giara from one of Big Ape's mutants, and they have sex.\n\nShorty leads them to an underground vault, where they find a deceased professor and a life support chamber containing Melissa, the professor's daughter, who entered hibernation before the bombs fell and thus remained fertile. They also find a station wagon to escape through the Lincoln Tunnel. Big Ape and Giara stay with Melissa while Shorty, Parsifal, and Ratchet leave to find armor plating for the car. Big Ape then knocks Giara unconscious and impregnates Melissa.\n\nAt a junkyard, Shorty distracts the Euracs and sacrifices himself to buy Parsifal and Ratchet time to salvage. They return, collect Melissa, and drive through a cave wall into the tunnel. Parsifal manages to navigate the armored car past several minefields and barricades to freedom, but Big Ape is killed by a laser trap. While driving through the desert to their rendezvous, Parsifal deduces that Ratchet is actually a cyborg. Ratchet attacks him and stabs Giara before Parsifal kills him. Giara begs Parsifal ensure humanity's survival as she dies in his arms.\n\nBack at the Confederacy's headquarters, the President reveals that he is terminally ill, and gives Parsifal his place on the rocketship, which is revealed to be the base itself. As the ship blasts off, Parsifal watches Melissa finally awaken.\n\nCreature Feature gave the movie 2 out of 5 stars. While it found the rubble and sewers to be well done, it states the acting and direction to be lacking. Moria found the movie to be better than other Italian exploitation films, and better than most other Mad Max rip-offs, giving the movie 2 stars. TV Guide gave the movie one our of 5 stars, finding it to be silly with \"ludicrous plot full of cliches and holes, bad acting, and laughable special effects.\" \n\n\"2019, After the Fall of New York\" was distributed in the United States in January 1985 with a 95 minute running time.

It is the administrative centre of the local government area of Northern Beaches Council and, along with Brookvale, is considered to be the main centre of the Northern Beaches region.\n\nThe reasons for Dee Why's name remain unclear. The earliest reference to it is a pencil note in surveyor James Meehan's field book, \"Wednesday, 27th Sept, 1815 Dy Beach - Marked a Honey Suckle Tree near the Beach\". What it meant to him is not clear, but various claims have been put forward, including:\n\n\nFrom 1840 the name was recorded as one word, 'Deewhy'. The term 'Dee Why' was also used to name 'Dee Why Heights' or Highlands, known as Narraweena since 1951, and 'Dee Why West', the name of which was changed to Cromer in 1969.\n\nDee Why Post Office opened on 26 April 1915. Dee Why Beach Post Office opened on 1 December 1945 and closed in 1979. Dee Why North Post Office opened on 1 October 1959 and closed in 1993.\n\nLittle is known of the Aboriginal people who lived in the Dee Why area before European occupation, although there is evidence of a midden at the southern end of Dee Why Beach, and the indigenous people were known to fish on the then wider and deeper lagoon, where black swans were once seen in large flocks.\n\nThe first land in the area to be listed by the New South Wales government Gazette was granted to William Cossar in the early 19th century, James Wheeler purchased 90 acres in 1842, but by the mid-19th century most of the land in what is now Dee Why had been acquired by James Jenkins and other members of the Jenkins family. Elizabeth Jenkins, eldest daughter of James, gave all her land to the Salvation Army upon her death in 1900, in recognition of their support in her old age. The Salvation Army received in total of land, of which were in Dee Why. An industrial farm, as well as hostels for boys, girls and women were established on this land. Access to the beach was limited by the Salvation Army's land, with a wire netting barrier running along its length.\n\nWarringah Council was formed in 1906, giving Dee Why residents a local government. In 1911 it was decided that the tram line that had expanded in sections from Manly since 1903 was to be extended from Brookvale on to Collaroy Beach via Pittwater Road, and soon after to Narrabeen. The line opened on 3 August 1912 with an hourly service, and it was perhaps this development that caused the Salvation Army in 1913 to progressively sell off most of its holdings on the Northern Beaches, starting with The Oaks Estate Auction, which gave its name to one of the main streets of Dee Why, Oaks Avenue. Another main street, Howard Avenue, commemorates Commissioner Thomas Howard, the first commissioner of the Salvation Army in Australia and New Zealand. By 1920, most of Dee Why had been subdivided. From the end of 1938, the trams, as a result of losses due to low population density and competition with new bus routes that duplicated their services, operated only at peak hours for commuters and on weekends for tourists, and finally ceased operating with the final run on 30 September 1939.\n\nIn 1971, work began on a new Dee Why civic centre, inspired by Sulman Prize-winning architects Edwards, Madigan & Torzillo. The building was completed in 1972 and the Council moved there in 1973 from the Shire Hall in Brookvale where meetings had been held since 1912, making Dee Why the seat of Warringah Council.\n\nDee Why is contained in the drainage basin of Dee Why Lagoon, and stretches from Victor Road in the west to Dee Why Beach in the east, and from the crest of Wingala Hill to the northern edge of Dee Why Lagoon. The Bicentennial Coastal Walkway from Queenscliff to Palm Beach leads from North Curl Curl Beach in the south, along the cliffs of Dee Why Head and down to the southern end of Dee Why Beach. The track exhibits the coastal heath ecosystem that used to be spread all over the Warringah area, and has been extensively regenerated since 1991.\n\nAnother significant natural area within Dee Why is the Stony Range Regional Botanic Garden, established in 1957 on the site of an old quarry and located just south of the Dee Why town centre. The garden, which contains plants from all over Australia as well as those indigenous to the area, has four main sections, the rainforest gully, the sandstone heath on the site of the quarry, the Federation Cascades built in 2001 to commemorate the centenary of the federation of Australia, and the primitive plant section, with examples of plant species that have survived for millions of years. The garden is open from 8am to 5pm every day except Christmas Day, and admission is free.\n\nDee Why Beach runs for about 1.2Â km along the eastern border, overlooking the Tasman Sea. To the north are the dunes separating the beach from the Dee Why Lagoon. At its southern end is the Ted Jackson Reserve (renamed from Dee Why Beach Reserve in October 2010), with picnic areas and century old Norfolk Island Pines, similar to the ones in Manly. The reserve is contained by a seawall running for approximately 400m, and was upgraded in 2006, with new pathways, stairs, lookout platforms, an upper promenade and the restoration of the war memorial. There are two playgrounds in the vicinity, located at the southern end of the beach and west of the Dee Why Surf Life Saving Club, near to the lagoon, and several ocean pools located below cliffs to the south. Car parking facilities exist in the streets to the south, as well as a car park next to the Life Saving Club.\n\nBehind the beach's remaining dunes, to the north of The Strand, is Dee Why Lagoon. Its entrance marks the northern end of Dee Why Beach and the southern extent of Long Reef Beach. The high conservation value of the lagoon and its surrounding area was recognised in 1973 when it was proclaimed a wildlife refuge. It is an extremely significant area for local and migratory birds, and is listed on migratory bird agreements with Japan and China. The Dee Why Lagoon Wildlife Refuge covers an area of 77 hectares, of which the lagoon takes up 30 hectares. The rest of the reserve is primarily swamp-based bushland, as well as the coastal dune ecosystem between the lagoon and the sea. It is a major scenic feature of the Northern Beaches, situated off Pittwater Road, and accessible from Dee Why Parade and The Strand.\n\nThe main commercial area in Dee Why is centred on either side of Pittwater Road, the main arterial road on the Northern Beaches, and continues down the streets leading to the beach as well as upwards along Fisher Road. This area is characterised by 1960s shop-top, two- and three-storey buildings and later, four- to ten-storey developments.\n\nThere are currently four shopping centres in Dee Why including:\n\n\nAlso on Pittwater Road is the Warringah Council Chambers and the Dee Why branch of Warringah Library, one of four networked branches of the Library including Belrose, Forestville and Warringah Mall.\n\nThe Strand, running along the southern Dee Why beach front, is a major commercial area, and features two to four-storey buildings with Apartments, cafes, restaurants and bars overlooking the beach.\n\nThere is also a set of eight mainly single-storey shops at the corner of South Creek Road and Pittwater in the northern part of Dee Why, next to the lagoon, as well as a few corner stores scattered in the more suburban areas.\n\nPublic transport in Dee Why primarily runs along Pittwater Road in the form of buses, with services southwards to the City, Manly and North Sydney, and northwards to Collaroy, Cromer, Narrabeen, and the Pittwater area. The main bus stop for these services is located at the intersection with Howard Avenue. There are also semi-regular services to Chatswood via McInstosh Road to the west, as well as to Manly via Freshwater. Two express services to the city also run from near Dee Why Beach in the early morning and back from the city in the afternoon to serve commuters on weekdays.\n\nThere are many sporting clubs in the area of Dee Why.\n\nOne of the well known teams is the rugby union side, Dee Why Lions. Dee Why Lions have very well established teams in the game of Rugby ranging from children's teams to the senior team that competes in the NSW Suburban Rugby Union sixth-division Meldrum Cup.\n\nThe Dee Why Football Club, also known as \"The Swans\", is a soccer club officially formed in 1946, making it one of the oldest soccer teams on the Northern Beaches. There are two medals, dating from 1925 and 1926, that were awarded to players for Dee Why, that suggest it could have an even longer history. Notably in 1983 at an exhibition match against Manly Warringah, Dee Why won 2-1 with the winning goal scored by guest player George Best, a former Manchester United and Northern Ireland national football team member.\n\nDee Why is also home to the Dee Why Surfing Fraternity, Australia's oldest surfboard riders club, founded in 1961 and still competing each month.\n\nDee Why was the home of the Evergreen Tennis & Squash Centre, located at Campbell Avenue until its closure in December 2010. The site is now occupied by houses.\n\nThere are two public primary schools in Dee Why, both along Fisher Road: Dee Why Public School (1922) and Fisher Road Special School (1953).

A Methodist church was built on the corner of Howard Avenue and Avon Road in the 1930s, and is currently the oldest church building in Dee Why. With the rest of the Methodist Church, it joined the Uniting Church at its founding in 1977. It is currently home to the Cecil Gribble Congregation, a Tongan congregation of the Uniting Church. St John's Anglican Church was established in 1922. The current church, constructed in 1957 on the corner of Oaks Avenue and Avon Road, is well known for its modern stained glass artwork, installed over a period of years, including the recent addition of the Missions to Seamen Window in the new chapel, from the old MTS Chapel in The Rocks. St Kevin's Catholic Church was established in 1923 on Oaks Avenue. The current building, built in 1962, has a very distinctive design mimicking the structure of a tent. The Dee Why Baptist Church (1940) was renamed the New Life Baptist Church in 2000. St David's Uniting Church, the spire of which can be seen from a long way on Pittwater Road in both directions, was built in the 1940s as a Presbyterian church, joining the Uniting Church with two-thirds of the Presbyterians in 1977. The short section of road from Pittwater Road to Fisher Road was formerly known as part of Howard Avenue, but was renamed in the late 1990s to St David Avenue. The Salvation Army still maintains a presence in Dee Why, with a church located on Fisher Road, and there is a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall further north on Pittwater Road.\n\nAccording to the 2016 census, there were 21,518 residents in Dee Why. 52.0% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England (5.8%), China (3.8%), India (3.4%), Brazil (3.0%) and New Zealand (2.8%). 61.5% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Portuguese 3.5%, Mandarin 2.5%, Tibetan 2.2%, Nepali 1.8% and Serbian 1.7%. Dee Why's housing is higher density than average for Australia. Of occupied private dwellings in Dee Why, 79.8% were flats, units or apartments with 16.6% being separate houses and 3.1% being semi-detached.\n\nDee Why is within the Northern Beaches Council local government area, and is home to the Warringah Civic Centre built in 1973, which contains the Council Chambers and is situated just to the north of the Sulman Award-winning Library, completed in 1966. Formerly split between the A and B Wards of Warringah Council, the suburb is now entirely within the Curl Curl Ward of Northern Beaches Council, returning three councillors.\n\nDee Why is in both the federal electorates of Warringah, represented by the independent member of parliament Zali Steggall, and the electorate of Mackellar, which is currently represented by Jason Falinski, a former Warringah councillor of the Liberal Party. The suburb lies within both the state electorates of Wakehurst and Manly, who are represented by the Liberal Party members Brad Hazzard, the Health Minister, and James Griffin, a former Manly Deputy Mayor, respectively.\n\n"}

The major varieties in Mozambique are called Shanga and Danda; that in Zimbabwe is simply called Ndau or Ndaundau.\n\nNdau is part of a continuum with other neighboring varieties of the Shona group (e.g. Manyika, Karanga) and has often been included as a Shona dialect.

It has \"benched seats arranged in rows, looking forward, commonly used for large parties, whether as public conveyances or for excursions.\" It was especially popular for sight-seeing or \"works outings\" to the country or the seaside, organised by businesses once a year. The name derives from the French \"char Ã  bancs\" (\"carriage with wooden benches\"), the vehicle having originated in France in the early 19th century.\n\nAlthough the vehicle has not been common on the roads since the 1920s, a few signs survive from the era; a notable example at Wookey Hole in Somerset warns that the road to the neighbouring village of Easton is unsuitable for charabancs. The word 'charabanc' was in common usage until the middle of the 20th century but was deleted as obsolete from the pocket edition of the Collins Dictionary in 2011. The word is in common usage especially in Northern England in a jocular way referring to works outings by coach.\n\nIn Australia a modern similar type of bus or motorcoach, with two lateral doors for each row of seats, survived up to the 1970s and was referred to as side loader bus; but all or most of them were not open-topped. One such a bus based in Echuca, Victoria, has been restored and is used at the Port of Echuca on some public holidays and special events.\n\nBuses with similar arrangement of doors and seats are a common equipment for the antiriot squads of many police forces, as the arrangement lends itself to the squad exiting the vehicle quickly.\n\nIntroduced in the 1840s as a French sporting vehicle, the \"char Ã  bancs\" was popular at race meetings and for hunting or shooting parties. It could be pulled by a four-in-hand team of horses or a pair in pole gear. It had two or more rows of crosswise bench seats, plus a slightly lower rear seat for a groom, and most also had a slatted trunk for luggage. Initially used by the wealthy, they were later enlarged with more seats for school or works excursions and tourist transport, as a cheaper version of the tourist coach. The first charabanc in Britain was presented to Queen Victoria by Louis Philippe of France and is preserved in the Royal Mews.\n\nBefore the First World War, motor charabancs were used mainly for day trips, as they were not comfortable enough for longer journeys, and were largely replaced by motor buses in the 1920s.\nThe charabanc of the 1920s tended to last only a few years. It was normal at the time for the body to be built separately from the motor chassis and some were fitted in summer only; a second goods body would be fitted in its place in winter to keep the vehicle occupied.\n\nCharabancs were normally open top, with a large canvas folding hood stowed at the rear in case of rain, much like a convertible motor car. If rain started, this had to be pulled into position, a very heavy task, and it was considered honourable for the male members of the touring party to assist in getting it into position. The side windows would be of mica (a thin layer of quartz-like stone).\n\nThe charabanc offered little or no protection to the passengers in the event of an overturning accident, they had a high centre of gravity when loaded (and particularly if overloaded), and they often traversed the steep and winding roads leading to the coastal villages popular with tourists. These factors led to fatal accidents which contributed to their early demise.\n\nFactory day outings (annual works trips) in the 19th and early 20th century were quite common for workers, especially for those from the northern weaving mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire during the wakes weeks. The 1940s and 1950s were relatively hard times due to national recovery being slow after the Second World War; rationing was still evident and annual holidays had not really become established for poorer workers such as weavers and spinners, so a day's outing to the seaside was a rare treat and all that some workers with large families could afford. \"Charabanc trips\" were usually only for adults, again due to finance. Occasionally the mill owner would help to pay for these outings, but this was not always the case.\n\nThe charabancs, or coaches, were pretty basic vehicles; noisy, uncomfortable and often poorly upholstered with low-backed seats and used mainly for short journeys to the nearest resort town or the races. Some working men's clubs also organised days out and these trips were often subsidised by the clubs themselves from membership subscriptions that had been paid throughout the year. A few pence a week would be paid to a club or mill trip organiser and marked down in a notebook. This would be paid out to the saver on the day of the trip as spending money on the day. This day out would often be the highlight of the year for some workers and the only chance to get away from the smog and grime of the busy mill towns.\n\nLater, in the late 1960s and 1970s, as the mills prospered and things improved financially, the annual \"wakes week\" took over and a one-week mass exodus from northern mill towns during the summer months took precedence over the charabanc trips, and a full week's holiday at a holiday camp or in a seaside boarding house for the full family became the norm, instead of a single day out.\n\nThe French \"char Ã  banc\" appears in Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" [1877] in Part 6, Chapter 17 in the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation [2000].\n\nThe charabanc is notably mentioned in Dylan Thomas's short story \"A Story\", also known as \"The Outing\". In this piece the young Thomas unintentionally finds himself on the annual men's charabanc outing to Porthcawl. Within the story the charabanc is referred to as a 'chara' in colloquial Welsh English.\n\n\"Cider with Rosie\" by Laurie Lee features a 1917 charabanc outing from rural Gloucestershire to Weston-super-Mare.\n\nVince Hill's \"A Day at the Seaside\" begins with the line \"Climb up little darling, into the charabanc\". The song, written by Les Vandyke, came fifth in the 1963 Song for Europe competition.\n\nA char-a-banc also figures prominently in Rudyard Kipling's short story \"The Village that Voted the Earth Was Flat\" (1913).\n\nChar-a-bancs are mentioned in Dorothy Edwards' book \"The Witches and the Grinnygog\" in the chapter entitled \"Mrs. Umphrey's Ghost Story\". In it, Mrs. Umphrey tries to reassure the ghost of Margaret that the char-a-bancs are not the chariots of devils.\n\n\"Peaches\", a single by the Stranglers makes reference to a charabanc, with vocalist Hugh Cornwell explaining to the listener how he will be stuck on a beach \"the whole summer\" after missing a charabanc.\n\nIn Agatha Christie's \"The Dead Harlequin\", from \"The Mysterious Mr Quin\" series, the young artist Frank Bristow reacts angrily to the older Colonel Monkton's dismissive (and presumably snobbish) attitude towards charabancs and their use in tourism. They are also mentioned in the story \"Double Sin\" when the motor coach Poirot and Hastings are traveling on stops for lunch at Monkhampton. \"...in a big courtyard, about twenty char-a-bancs were parked--char-a-bancs which had come from all over the country.\"\n\nCharabancs appeared several times in John Le Carre's \"The Little Drummer Girl\".\n\nThe Jethro Tull song \"Wond'ring Again\" by Ian Anderson uses the term: \"Incestuous ancestry's charabanc ride...\" \n\nGeorge Harrison described the plot of The Beatles' 1967 film Magical Mystery Tour \"a charabanc trip\".\n\nOn the Small Faces' 1968 album \"Ogden's Nut Gone Flake\", the title character of the \"Happiness Stan\" suite of songs taking up side 2 lives in a Charabanc, described in characteristic fashion by narrator Stanley Unwin as \"a four wheeled fillolop out the backgrove\". On the 1968 performance by the band of the suite on BBC2's \"Colour Me Pop\", Unwin renders this section as \"an ancient Victoriana Charabanc - and this was the old type, sit-up-and-beg, rotate fit a poppy with solid wheels.\" \n\nThe charabanc appears in Louisa May Alcott's Little Women. Mr Lawrence, the March's wealthy neighbour, lends it to the March girls. Jokingly, they call it the \"cherry bounce\".\n\n\n"}

Beginning in 1976, the book's chapters had been serialized in the Marin County alternative weekly newspaper \"Pacific Sun\", as well as the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". It was first published in book form in 1977.\n\nThe book deals with life in the mid-1970s in Marin County, a suburban and affluent county just north of San Francisco.\n\nThe book was popular at the time of its initial publication. It has since been out of print for several years in the United States. It was reprinted in the United Kingdom by Prion Humour Classics in 2000 and as an apostrophebooks.com e-book in 2013.\n\nA film version of the book, called \"Serial\", was released in 1980 and starred Martin Mull and Tuesday Weld. It was received with limited critical praise and did not perform well at the box office.\n\n\"The Serial\" is divided into 52 short chapters. It chronicles the lives of a group of residents of Marin County, mostly in their mid-to-late 30s and early 40s. The plot revolves around Harvey and Kate Holroyd, a couple in the midst of the mid-1970s Marin County lifestyle who are undergoing marital problems, with many other characters introduced in the book.\n\nThe period of the storyline covers a time between the heyday of the 1960s counterculture and the culture loosely described as \"Yuppie\". There are elements of soap opera in the book, although the tone is comedic (specifically, satirical) rather than tragic. The novel describes its characters' lifestyles, including their interest in various New Age beliefs and human potential movement groups (including est, transcendental meditation, consciousness-raising, and rebirthing); their unconventional and arguably lax child-rearing techniques; and their embrace of a number of then-current fads, such as fern bars, jogging, and organic food. Wife swapping and open marriage are common as are cocaine use and frequent divorces. Many things associated with the human potential movement are mentioned and satirized, including est, the Fischer-Hoffman Process, and \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\"; radical feminism and Sierra Club membership are seemingly ubiquitous; and kids are sent to free-form summer camps offering survival training and \"spontaneous rap sessions\". The book satirizes many of the elements of a particular mid-to-late 1970s subculture, also described to some degree by author Tom Wolfe in his 1976 non-fiction essay \"The Me Decade and the Third Great Awakening\", particularly as manifested in the lives of people then between the ages of about 30 and 45 in affluent parts of California.\n\nMany of the characters in \"The Serial\" also speak a particular jargon or lexicon, saying words and phrases like \"flash on\" (a phrasal verb meaning \"to have a sudden insight about\", as in \"I really flashed on that\"), \"\"Really\"\" (to signify assent), and others.\n\n\"The Serial\" contains a great number of specific references to actual locations (restaurants, stores, streets) in 1970s Marin County. In the original \"Pacific Sun\" weekly chapters, black-and-white illustrations by Tom Cervenak accompany the text. These illustrations were included in the original edition of the book and in the first paperback edition of the book.\n\n"}
{"id": "1928005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928005", "title": "1890 Australian maritime dispute", "text": "1890 Australian maritime dispute\n\nThe 1890 Australian maritime dispute was an industrial dispute that began on 15 August 1890 when the Mercantile Marine Officers' Association directed its members to give 24 hours' notice to their employers after negotiations broke down with the Steamship Owners' Association of Victoria over longstanding pay and conditions claims. Industrial action quickly spread to seamen, wharf labourers, then gas stockers. Coal miners from Newcastle, Broken Hill, and even New Zealand were locked out after refusing to dig coal for non-union operated vessels. By September 1890, 28,500 workers were on strike.\n\nThe Melbourne branch of the Marine Officers' Association had joined the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, and the New Zealand branch was affiliated with the Maritime Labour Council. In July 1890 the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand had conceded a pay rise of one pound, following arbitration. Many of the owners had privately conceded that an increase in pay was justified and overdue. The Sydney branch of the union, not affiliated with the Sydney Maritime Council, negotiated with the owners and were told their case was reasonable, but could not be considered while the Melbourne branch was affiliated with Melbourne Trades Hall. In a last minute mediation, officials of the union agreed to withdraw from the Melbourne Trades Hall, if employers agreed to compromise in a last minute meeting with a union delegation. The Shipowners refused to meet the delegation, which thus precipitated the strike.\n\nOstensibly over pay and conditions, the causes of the dispute were considered more complex, and point to an employer conspiracy to render trade union activity ineffective, and employer activity to counter union solidarity in secondary boycott of non-union shorn wool in the pastoral industry. While some historians argue that the strike was caused by a downturn in economic conditions, others argue the depression of the 1890s did not start till 1892.\n\nIn early July 1890, the Amalgamated Shearers' Union of Australasia had issued a manifesto calling a boycott on non-union wool shorn in the coming shearing season. This emulated a successful boycott of non-union wool called by the Queensland Shearers Union in 1889 and instituted by the Wharf Labourer's Union and Brisbane Trades Hall. The campaign to break union solidarity was engineered by stevedore Alfred Lamb, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, owner of one of the four main wool exporting firms, and vice president of the NSW Employers' Union. He attended meetings of the Pastoralists Union of NSW, the Pastoralists Union of Victoria, organised a memorandum of understanding and agreements among wool shippers, shipping agents and shipowners.\n\nWhile police had been used in strikes before 1890, the military had not usually been called in other than at the Lambton Colliery strike in the Hunter Valley two years earlier. During the strike military units were extensively used in New South Wales and Victoria. Armed troops were deployed to support the police in Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle and a number of other ports around Australia, as violence escalated against non-union labour and against the property of companies operating shipping, the mines, the wharves and ports.\n\nIn Melbourne, the announcement that a public meeting was going to be held on 31 August 1890 to support the maritime strikers sent the Victorian government into precautionary mode. On the eve of the meeting, the Victorian Mounted Rifles were briefed by their commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Tom Price:\n\nMen of the Mounted Rifles, one of your obligations imposes on you the duty of resisting invasion by a foreign enemy, but you are also liable to be called upon to assist in preserving law and order in the colony. ... To do your work faintly would be a grave mistake. If it has to be done effectively you will each be supplied with 40 rounds of ammunition, leaden bullets, and if the order is given to fire, don't let me see any rifle pointed in the air; fire low and lay them out so that the duty will not have to be performed again.\n\nPrice was quite clear and quite unapologetic about his intentions. He only wanted â²'to hit the strikers in the legs ... not to kill them outright\". He explained that the term 'lay them out' was used in his regiment to mean 'temporary disablement'.\n\nA force of 1,000 militia and mounted police and another 1,000 special constables were embodied by the time of the meeting. These forces, apart from a troop of mounted police were held in reserve out of the way and the 40,000 who attended the meeting, although enthusiastic, were orderly and the forces were not called in.\n\nThe strike was defeated when the Marine Officers returned to work on the employers terms in November 1890, with Illawarra coal miners being the last workers to return to work in January 1891. A shortage of money to sustain the strike and a plentiful supply of strikebreakers eventually defeated the strikers. Wage cuts were introduced for everyone in the maritime industry, with wage cuts of up to 30 per cent. The defeat of the 1980 maritime strike and the 1891 Australian shearers' strike, laid the framework for the Australian labour movement entry into parliamentary politics. The New South Wales Labour Defence Committee summed up the unions mood in this statement:\n\nthe time has come when trade unionists must use the parliamentary machine that in the past has used them.\n"}

It was the first major battle of the Gallic Wars and ended in a tactical victory for the outnumbered Roman army.\n\nThe Helvetii were a tribe that originated from what is now Switzerland. Just prior to the battle with Caesar, they had commenced on a mass migration through Roman Gaul towards the Atlantic coast.\n\nAt Geneva, the Romans destroyed the wooden bridge across the Rhone and constructed of fortifications.

The properties of a reference monitor are captured by the acronym NEAT, which means:\n\n\nFor example, Windows 3.x and 9x operating systems were not built with a reference monitor, whereas the Windows NT line, which also includes Windows 2000 and Windows XP, was designed to contain a reference monitor, although it is not clear that its properties (tamperproof, etc.) have ever been independently verified, or what level of computer security it was intended to provide.\n\nThe claim is that a reference validation mechanism that satisfies the reference monitor concept will correctly enforce a system's access control policy, as it must be invoked to mediate all security-sensitive operations, must not be tampered, and has undergone complete analysis and testing to verify correctness. The abstract model of a reference monitor has been widely applied to any type of system that needs to enforce access control, and is considered to express the necessary and sufficient properties for any system making this security claim.\n\nAccording to Ross Anderson, the reference monitor concept was introduced by James Anderson in an influential 1972 paper. Peter Denning in a 2013 oral history stated that James Anderson credited the concept to a paper he and Scott Graham presented at a 1972 conference.\n\nSystems evaluated at B3 and above by the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) must enforce the reference monitor concept.\n\n"}

Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953), is a landmark legal case in 1953 that saw the formal recognition of the state secrets privilege, a judicially recognized extension of presidential power.\n\nThree employees of the Radio Corporation of America, an Air Force contractor, were killed when a B-29 Superfortress crashed in 1948 in Waycross, Georgia. Their widows brought an action in tort seeking damages in federal court, under the Federal Tort Claims Act. As part of this action, they requested production of accident reports concerning the crash, but were told by the Air Force that the release of such details would threaten national security. Because of the failure of the government to produce the documents, a directed verdict in favor of the plaintiffs was granted by the trial court. The judgment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The United States Supreme Court reversed the decision, and remanded it to the trial court. After this, a settlement was reached with the widows, who received an aggregate sum of $170,000 in exchange for a release of liability to the Government.\n\n\nIn this case, there was a valid claim of privilege under Rule 34; and a judgment based under Rule 37 on refusal to produce the documents subjected the United States to liability which Congress did not consent by the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\n\nIn a suit under the Tort Claims Act, the District Court entered a judgment against the Government. The Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded.\n\nA military aircraft on a flight to test secret electronic equipment crashed, and certain civilian observers aboard were killed. Their widows sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act and moved under Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for production of the Air Force's accident investigation report and statements made by surviving crew members during the investigation. The Secretary of the Air Force filed a formal claim of privilege, stating that the matters were privileged against disclosure under the Air Force regulations issued under R. S. section 161, and that the aircraft and its personnel were \"engaged in a highly secret mission.\" The Judge Advocate General filed an affidavit stating that the material could not be furnished \"without seriously hampering national security,\" but he offered to produce the surviving crew members for examination by the plaintiffs and to permit them to testify as to all matters except those of a \"classified nature.\" In the absence of the documents which the Air Force failed to produce, the trial court directed a summary judgment for the plaintiffs against the Government. The Appeals Court of the Third Circuit affirmed the decision. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court in certiorari.\n\nThe majority opinion was written by Justice Fred M. Vinson. He wrote, \"We have had broad propositions pressed upon us for decision. The Government has claimed privilege to withhold information in their custody, if it is in the public interest to do so. Respondents [plaintiffs] have asserted that the executive's power to withhold documents was waived by the Tort Claims Act. Both positions have constitutional overtones which we find it unnecessary to pass upon, there being a narrower ground for decision.\"\n\n\"The Federal Tort Claims Act expressly makes the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to suits against the United States. The judgment in this case imposed liability upon the Government by operation of Rule 37, for refusal to produce documents under Rule 34. Since Rule 34 compels production only of matters \"not privileged,\" the essential question is whether there was a valid claim of privilege under the Rule. We hold that there was, and that, therefore, the judgment below subjected the United States to liability on terms to which Congress did not consent by the Tort Claims Act.\"\n\nJustice Hugo Black, Justice Felix Frankfurter and Justice Robert H. Jackson filed a one sentence dissent indicating they agreed with the decision by Judge Maris in the earlier Court of Appeals decision.\n\nThe declassified accident report, released in 2000, is available online, and indicates that the B-29 crashed because a fire started in an engine. This document also reports that the plaintiffs received a settlement of $170,000. The settlement date was effective June 22, 1953, some three months after the Supreme Court ruling. In consideration for the money paid by the government, the case was dismissed with prejudice, meaning all future litigation on this case was forfeited. The radio program \"This American Life\" reported in 2009, that, contrary to claims made in the case, the accident report contained no information on the secret equipment on the plane except to note that secret equipment was present, a fact which had been reported in the press at the time. The program interviewed the daughter of one of the crash victims who described the government's claims in the case as fraudulent.\n\nAfter release of the classified documents, new litigation was attempted, based in part on a complaint that the classified material contained no secret information. Monetary damages were sought as a remedy. The initial new claim was to the Supreme Court for a writ of error in \"coram nobis\", based on the claim that the use of the \"secret\" label in the original crash report was a fraud on the court. This was an attempt to overturn the settlement agreement of June 1953. This motion was denied on June 23, 2003 in In re Herring. The case was refiled as Herring v. United States in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on October 1, 2003. The trial court found no fraud in the government's claim of privilege in 1953.\n\nIn 2005, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the decision in the new litigation, in which District Court determined \"there was no fraud because the documents, read in their historical context, could have revealed secret information about the equipment being tested on the plane and, on a broader reading, the claim of privilege referred to both the mission and the workings of the B-29\". Even without the broad reading that the claim included secrecy concerning the aircraft itself, the court found it possible that the documents' revelations \"that the mission required an 'aircraft capable of dropping bombs' and that the mission required an airplane capable of 'operating at altitudes of 20,000 feet and above'\" could have been \"seemingly insignificant pieces of information [that] would have been of keen interest to a Soviet spy fifty years ago.\"\n\nThere has been much discussion about the use of government privilege to classify information. On the one hand, there is the need to protect government secrecy. On the other, there is always suspicion that \"classified documents\" are merely a way to cover-up government malfeasance or bad faith actions of the executive branch.\n\nPrivilege is the modern term applied to those considerations which avoid liability where it might otherwise follow. As it is generally used, the term applies to any circumstance used to justify or excuse a prima facie tort, such as an assault, battery or trespass. It signifies that the defendant has acted to further an interest of such social importance that it is entitled to protection, even at the expense of damage to the plaintiff. The defendant is allowed freedom of action because his own interests, or those of the public, require it, and because social policy will best be served by permitting it. The privilege is bounded by current ideas of what will most effectively promote the general welfare. The question of \"privilege\" as a defense arises almost exclusively in connection with intentional torts. Negligence is a matter of risk and probability of harm; and where the likelihood of injury to the plaintiff is relatively slight, the defendant will necessarily be allowed greater latitude than where the harm is intended, or substantially certain to follow. It is the bare value of the respective interests involved and the extent of the harm from which the act is intended to protect the one as compared with that which it is intended to cause to the other which determines the existence or nonexistence of the privilege.\n\nThe relative social value given to an interest which the defendant seeks to further can affect the nature and extent of a privilege. Occasionally, the defendant may act at his peril if he makes a mistake of fact or law; at other times, an actor is justified in acting on the basis of what the facts reasonably appear to be. At other times, the defendant is justified so long as he was acting in good faith. Or, the privilege may be regarded as absolute in the sense that the court will not permit an inquiry into motive or purpose, since this could result in subjecting the honest person to harassing litigation and claims. When no inquiry is permitted into motive or purpose, it is sometimes said that defendant has an absolute privilege; when the defendant can act in either good or bad faith, with impunity, it is more properly called \"immunity\" rather than \"privilege\".\n\nMany commentators have alleged government misuse of secrecy in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Reynolds. Senator Leahy in his opening remarks for the Senate Judiciary Committee's February 13, 2008, hearing on the State Secrets Privilege called the Third Circuit's decision in Herring v. United States \"a little mystifying\". The hearing featured testimony from several experts in the field of government privilege.\n\nThe state secrets privilege serves a vital function by ensuring that private litigants cannot use litigation to force the disclosure of information that, if made public, would directly harm the national security of the United States. The privilege has a long-standing history and has been invoked to protect such information. The privilege is firmly rooted in the constitutional authorities and obligations assigned to the President under Article II to protect the national security of the United States.\n\nAccountability is preserved by a number of procedural and substantive requirements that must be satisfied before a court may accept an assertion of the state secrets privilege. The Supreme Court in Reynolds held that such information should be protected from disclosure when there is a \"danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.\" The Court noted that the privilege was absolute, even if the need in the plaintiff was compelling. The Fifth Circuit has noted, \"the greater public good â ultimately the less harsh remedy\" is to protect the information from disclosure, even where the result might be dismissal of the lawsuit.\n\nIt is well established that the President is constitutionally charged with protecting information relating to national security. As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[t]the authority to protect such information falls upon the President as the head of the Executive Branch and as Commander in Chief.\" The state secrets privilege is not a mere \"common law\" privilege. Instead the courts have long recognized the privilege has a firm foundation in the Constitution as was noted in United States v. Nixon where the Supreme Court noted the claim of privilege \"relates to the effective discharge of the President's powers, it is constitutionally based.\"\n\nIn the case of Herring v. United States, where it was disclosed that the declassified accident report from \"Reynolds\" was reviewed, Judge Davis found, \"[d]etails of flight mechanics, B-29 glitches, and technical remedies in the hands of the wrong party could surely compromise national security,\" and thus \"may have been of great moment to sophisticated intelligent analysts and Soviet engineers alike.\" The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed. (Note that the first Tupolev Tu-4, a Russian copy of the B-29 developed from captured aircraft, had flown in 1947. In the instant case, it was the electronic equipment which was classified as top secret, not the basic airframe of the B-29.)\n\nThe assertion of the privilege is not lightly entertained, and there are multiple administrative hurdles which have to be overcome once it is chosen to be asserted. There are multiple internal reviews, and the court has the final oversight. Still, the Executive Branch is given the utmost deference, and the courts cannot get into the business of second-guessing national security and foreign policy questions.\n\nTestimony of Patricia M. Wald, Former Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (1979â1999).\n\nThe states secrets privilege is a common law privilege originating with the judiciary which enunciated its necessity and laid down some directions for its scope in cases going back to the 19th century but more recently highlighted in \"United States v. Reynolds\". In the criminal area, the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) provides a relevant model for alternatives to full disclosure of classified information which allow a prosecution to continue while affording a defendant his or her due process rights. The time is now ripe for such legislation in the civil arena; litigants and their counsel are confused and unsure as to how to proceed in cases where the government raises the privilege; the courts themselves are confronted with precedent going in many different directions as to the scope of their authority and the requirements exercising it.\n\nIt is my opinion that the Freedom of Information Act should allow a judge to review the material and make a determination whether the assertion of privilege is warranted. The goal should be flexibility in the interpretation, leaving the determination to the judge in the federal court.\n\nTestimony of Louis Fisher, Constitutional Law Expert, Library of Congress.\n\nA \"state secret\" refers to any information that, if disclosed publicly, would be reasonably likely to cause significant harm to the national defense or foreign relations of the United States. Few judges, reading this language, will be likely to challenge the government. I would prefer to add a second sentence to the definition: \"The assertion of a state secret by the executive branch is to be tested by independent judicial review.\"\n\nConcerning \"immunity\", I would like to see a third sentence added to the definition: \"The 'states secrets privilege' may not shield illegal or unconstitutional activities.\" I see no reason privilege should sanction violations of statutes, treaties, or the Constitution.\n\nOur experience with state secrets cases underscores the need for judicial independence in assessing executive claims.\n\nTestimony of Michael A. Vatis, Partner, Steptoe & Johnson LLP.\n\nThere are two bedrock principles which are in natural tension. Secrecy in government can be an absolute necessity to the protection of our national security. This is especially so today, where the surveillance of terrorist groups is essential.\n\nAt the same time, the second principle is equally true. Secrecy in government is antithetical to democratic governance. Too much secrecy shields officials from oversight and inevitably breeds abuse and misconduct; it thus can fatally weaken the system of checks and balances that defines our system of government.\n\nAdd to this the corollary: there are secrets, then there are secrets. Too often, information deemed classified by the Executive Branch merely echoes what was in last week's newspapers. Classified material is frequently released to the public for strictly political reasons. In truth, many \"classified\" documents have no reason to be called such.\n\n\n\n"}

The Australian senior all-around National Champion in 2000, 2003 and 2004 and a multiple medalist at the Commonwealth Games, Slater is considered to be one of Australia's most internationally successful gymnasts.\n\nAllana Slater was born in Western Australia on 3 April 1984. She has a half-brother and -sister named Mark and Claire. Her father died in 1997 in a plane crash in Indonesia while she was competing in the Junior Pacific Alliance Championships.\n\nSlater began gymnastics in a toddler program at Kalajos School of Gymnastics at 16 months of age, at the suggestion of a family doctor, who thought it would help treat her sleep apnea and increase her strength. When she was 5 years old, she was spotted by talent scouts from the Western Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS) and invited her to join their elite development program. She began training in the WAIS program just after her 6th birthday. Slater made her national competition debut at the age of 9 and her international debut at 11.\n\n1998 stands out as a breakthrough year for Slater. At a dual meet against Japan, while still a junior, she emerged as the all-around champion, recording her first major international victory over her more experienced teammates, in addition to the best gymnasts from Japan. A good performance at the World Youth Games followed and soon after a third-place finish at the Australian Commonwealth Games team trial. Slater soon found herself standing with her teammates at the podium in Kuala Lumpur receiving Australia's first ever Commonwealth Games team gold medal. Individually, Slater also won two silver medals in the all around and floor exercise finals.\n\nSince then, Slater and her Australian teammates have truly made their mark on the international gymnastics scene. Their 5th-place finish at the 1999 World Championships (ahead of the US, who were the 1996 Olympic Champions) was a surprise to all but supporters of Australian gymnastics. At the same competition, Slater earned the highest place individual world ranking ever achieved by an Australian gymnast when she finished 9th in the individual all around.\n\nIn the most closely contested National Championship in Australian Gymnastics history, Slater pipped Trudy McIntosh with her last event to win her first National title early in 2000. In July of that year, at the Olympic Trials, Slater performed flawlessly to win the event, and in doing so assured herself of a place on her first Olympic team. Slater and the Australian girls performed well in the team competition to finish in 7th place - just missing the team final. Individually, Slater went on to compete in the individual all around where she finished in 16th place. She was also asked to join the Olympic medallists in performing in the post competition Gymnastics Gala.\n\nWhile all but one of her Olympic teammates left Sydney contemplating retirement, Slater continued to train and compete returning to Europe at the end of the year to take part in the last two events on the World Cup Circuit. At the DTB Cup, she made history winning Australia's first ever World Cup grand prix gold medal on the uneven bars, and also collected a silver medal on floor.\n\n2002 started with a bang for Slater when she won her second World Cup Grand Prix gold medal at the Cottbus event on the floor in Germany. The Pacific Alliance Championships soon followed and Slater helped the Australian team to a strong silver medal performance as well as picking up an individual silver medal on the floor exercise. At the Australian Championships, she finished in second place overall just behind Alex Croak, and won three of the four individual apparatus titles. This event doubled as the first selection trial for the Commonwealth Games team, and after a month-long selection camp at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in Canberra, Slater was named in her second Commonwealth Team. As it had been in 1998, the Australian team was a mixture of youth and experience. The team entered the competition in Manchester as hot favourites to defend the title they had won four years earlier, and did not disappoint. With a near perfect performance, the Australian girls won the team title by almost four points. Slater won four individual medals and returned home as one of the most successful Australian team members. She was selected as one of three athletes to represent the whole team in being welcomed home by the Prime Minister John Howard, a great honor for the gymnast. With the 2002 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships approaching quickly, there was barely time to celebrate. Slater was selected as Australia's only representative for the event after winning five gold medals at the selection trials.\n\nPerhaps Slater's greatest achievement came in 2003 at the world championships in Anaheim. Here, she led the Australian team to the bronze medal, the first ever won by any Australian female gymnast at this level, and of course their highest team placing ever. The team beat such traditional gymnastics powerhouses as China (who would have won the bronze if not for a team deduction that was not based on actual performances), and Russia.\n\nSlater competed in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, where she qualified for the balance beam final, but failed to medal after a fall from the beam. However, she continued to impress with her stylish gymnastics and choreography on floor. As one of the few gymnasts able to combine difficulty on the floor exercise with unique and stylish dance, she won many fans. She retired from gymnastics on 24 August 2005. \n\nShe has gone on to do some television work in Australia - providing commentary for Australian Cable Television for some Gymnastics events, as well as doing some television presenting work during the Australian coverage of the 2005 World Gymnastics Championships.\n\nShe has recently taken up pistol shooting.\n\n"}

Many factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status: not simply the number of individuals remaining, but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, and known threats. Various systems of conservation status exist and are in use at international, multi-country, national and local levels as well as for consumer use.\n\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation.\n\nAlso included are species that have gone extinct since 1500 CE. When discussing the IUCN Red List, the official term \"threatened\" is a grouping of three categories: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.\n\n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Many countries require CITES permits when importing plants and animals listed on CITES.\n\nIn the European Union (EU), the Birds and Habitats Directives are the legal instruments that evaluate the conservation status within the EU of species and habitats.\n\nNatureServe conservation status focuses on Latin America, United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. It has been developed by scientists from NatureServe, The Nature Conservancy, and the network of natural heritage programs and data centers. It is increasingly integrated with the IUCN Red List system. Its categories for species include: \"presumed extinct\" (GX), \"possibly extinct\" (GH), \"critically imperiled\" (G1), \"imperiled\" (G2), \"vulnerable\" (G3), \"apparently secure\" (G4), and \"secure\" (G5). The system also allows ambiguous or uncertain ranks including \"inexact numeric ranks\" (e.g. G2?), and \"range ranks\" (e.g. G2G3) for when the exact rank is uncertain. NatureServe adds a qualifier for \"captive or cultivated only\" (C), which has a similar meaning to the IUCN Red List \"extinct in the wild\" (EW) status.\n\nThe Red Data Book of the Russian Federation is used within the Russian Federation, and also accepted in parts of Africa.\n\nIn Australia, the \"Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999\" (EPBC Act) describes lists of threatened species, ecological communities and threatening processes. The categories resemble those of the 1994 IUCN Red List Categories & Criteria (version 2.3). Prior to the EPBC Act, a simpler classification system was used by the \"Endangered Species Protection Act 1992\". Some state and territory governments also have their own systems for conservation status. The codes for the Western Australian conservation system are given at Declared Rare and Priority Flora List (abbreviated to DECF when using in a taxobox).\n\nIn Belgium, the Flemish Research Institute for Nature and Forest publishes an online set of more than 150 nature indicators in Dutch.\n\nIn Canada, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) is a group of experts that assesses and designates which wild species are in some danger of disappearing from Canada. Under the Species at Risk Act (SARA), it is up to the federal government, which is politically accountable, to legally protect species assessed by COSEWIC.\n\nIn China, the State, provinces and some counties have determined their key protected wildlife species. There is the China red data book.\n\nIn Finland, many species are protected under the Nature Conservation Act, and through the EU Habitats Directive and EU Birds Directive.\n\nIn Germany, the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation publishes \"red lists of endangered species\".\n\nIndia has the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, Amended 2003 and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002.\n\nIn Japan, the Ministry of Environment publishes a Threatened Wildlife of Japan Red Data Book.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality publishes a list of threatened species, and conservation is enforced by the Nature Conservation Act 1998. Species are also protected through the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives.\n\nIn New Zealand, the Department of Conservation publishes the New Zealand Threat Classification System lists. threatened species or subspecies are assigned one of seven categories: Nationally Critical, Nationally Endangered, Nationally Vulnerable, Declining, Recovering, Relict, or Naturally Uncommon. While the classification looks only at a national level, many species are unique to New Zealand, and species which are secure overseas are noted as such.\n\nIn Russia, the Red Book of Russian Federation came out in 2001, it contains categories defining preservation status for different species. In it there are 8 taxa of amphibians, 21 taxa of reptiles, 128 taxa of birds, and 74 taxa of mammals, in total 231. There are also more than 30 regional red books, for example the red book of the Altaic region which came out in 1994.\n\nIn South Africa, The South African National Biodiversity Institute, established under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004, is responsible for drawing up lists of affected species, and monitoring compliance with CITES decisions. It is envisaged that previously diverse Red lists would be more easily kept current, both technically and financially.\n\nIn Thailand, the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act of BE 2535 defines fifteen reserved animal species and two classes of protected species, of which hunting, breeding, possession, and trade are prohibited or restricted by law. The National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is responsible for the regulation of these activities.\n\nIn Ukraine, the Ministry of Environment Protection maintains list of endangered species (divided into seven categories from \"0\" - extinct to \"VI\" - rehabilitated) and publishes it in the Red Book of Ukraine.\n\nIn the United States of America, the Endangered Species Act created the Endangered Species List.\n\nSome consumer guides for seafood, such as Seafood Watch, divide fish and other sea creatures into three categories, analogous to conservation status categories:\n\nThe categories do not simply reflect the imperilment of individual species, but also consider the environmental impacts of how and where they are fished, such as through bycatch or ocean bottom trawlers. Often groups of species are assessed rather than individual species (e.g. squid, prawns).\n\nThe Marine Conservation Society has five levels of ratings for seafood species, as displayed on their \"FishOnline\" website.\n\n\n"}

In 1993, she quit her job as a lawyer in Indianapolis, Indiana to start the American Justice Federation, a non-profit group that promoted pro-gun causes through a shortwave radio program, a computer bulletin board system, and sales of its newsletter and videos. She died of a prescription drug overdose in 2009.\n\nThompson was opposed to the Bill Clinton presidency. In 1994, Thompson helped compile a list of 24 people with some connection to Clinton who had died \"under other than natural circumstances\". The list was included in a letter to congressional leaders by former Rep. William Dannemeyer who called for hearings on the matter.\n\nIn 1993 she produced a videotape entitled \"Waco, the Big Lie\", which contained footage of the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas and a history of the community. The videotape was distributed widely, and for a short period after its release she was a regular guest on talk radio shows. The film challenged the mainstream news reports of the Branch Davidian siege and created a small sensation, alleging a government cover-up of the events surrounding the siege. Thompson pointed out many inconsistencies in the official story and the government reports, and the hypocrisy of using deadly weapons to \"rescue\" children from their parents.\n\nThompson also claimed that three BATF agents, whom she alleges were killed by friendly fire during the siege, were all former bodyguards of then-President Clinton and that the friendly fire was actually an assassination ordered by Clinton.\n\nIn 1994, Thompson produced \"Waco II, the Big Lie Continues\", in which she offered rebuttals to criticisms of her first film.\n\nShe made a third film in 1994, \"America Under Siege\" accusing the government of using \"black helicopters\" against patriots, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency of establishing concentration camps, facilities she claimed were to prevent patriots from interfering with plans to establish a \"New World Order\". The supposed FEMA Camp was the Beech Grove Shops, an Amtrak repair facility in Beech Grove, Indiana.\n\nIn 1994 Thompson declared herself \"Acting Adjutant General\" of the \"Unorganized Militia of the United States\" and announced plans for an armed march on Washington, D.C. in September of that year. She declared that militiamen would arrest and try for treason in \"Citizen's Courts\" those Congressional representatives not living up to their oath of office. The proposed march was almost immediately denounced by groups on the right wing, including the John Birch Society, and Thompson subsequently cancelled the march. Later, she was arrested for blocking a Presidential motorcade in Indianapolis. She carried one weapon concealed and also had one in her purse. Both guns were legal and no charges were filed.\n\nThompson died in St. Petersburg, Florida on May 10, 2009 after overdosing on medication. Her ashes were scattered in the Gulf of Mexico by her husband, in accordance with her last wishes.\n\nThe medication was posted to her by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). A lawsuit was lodged on the grounds Thompson had a history of depression and suicidal threats since 2005, but was still mailed a three-month supply of painkillers. Thompson's brother, Stephen Capps, said that the VA should have known better than to send her that much medication.\n\n"}

Lumsden and the \nsociobiologist E. O. Wilson, to denote a hypothetical 'unit' of culture, in their controversial attempt to analyse cultural evolution by using techniques borrowed from population genetics, and to infer a theory of evolution of the human mind. It effectively means much the same as the older term \"cultural trait\" used by anthropologists, and offers similar difficulties of identification and definition. The fullest exposition of their theory appeared in their book \"Genes, Mind, and Culture: the coevolutionary process\" (1981), which received many reviews in the scientific press, many of them highly negative; it was re-issued in 2005 with a review of subsequent developments. The term has declined in popularity, and the older term meme (coined by Richard Dawkins in his book \"The Selfish Gene\" (1976)) is now used in its stead almost universally (even by Wilson in his later writings).\n\nFor a discussion of the concept, see Meme.\n"}
{"id": "1928140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928140", "title": "Fault scarp", "text": "Fault scarp\n\nA fault scarp is a small step or offset on the ground surface where one side of a fault has moved vertically with respect to the other. It is the topographic expression of faulting attributed to the displacement of the land surface by movement along faults. They are exhibited either by differential movement and subsequent erosion along an old \"inactive\" geologic fault (a sort of old rupture), or by a movement on a recent active fault.\n\nFault scarps often contain highly fractured rock of both hard and weak consistency. In many cases, bluffs form from the upthrown block and can be very steep. The height of the scarp formation is equal to the vertical displacement along the fault. Active scarps are usually formed by tectonic displacement, e.g. when an earthquake changes the elevation of the ground and can be caused by any type of fault, including strike-slip faults, whose motion is primarily horizontal. This movement is usually episodic, with the height of the bluffs being the result of multiple movements over time. Displacement of around 5 to 10 meters per tectonic event is common.\n\nDue to the dramatic uplift along the fault, the fault scarp is very prone to erosion, especially if the material being uplifted consists of unconsolidated sediment. Weathering, mass wasting, and water runoff can soon wear down these bluffs, sometimes resulting in V-shaped valleys along runoff channels. Adjacent V-shaped valley formations give the remaining fault spurs a very triangular shape. This formation is known as a \"triangular facet\"; however, this landform is not limited to fault scarps.\n\nFault scarps may be only a few centimeters or many meters high. \"Fault-line scarps\" are coincident with faults, but are most typically formed by the erosion of weaker rocks that have been brought alongside more resistant ones by the movement along the fault. In the case of old eroded fault scarps, active erosion may have moved the physical cliff back away from the actual fault location which may be buried beneath a talus, alluvial fan or the sediments of the valley fill.\n\n\nSources\n"}

P. Pringle (1873â1932).\n\n\"Pringle\" was laid down by the Charleston Navy Yard, on 31 July 1941; launched on 2 May 1942, sponsored by Mrs. John D. H. Kane; and commissioned on 15 September 1942, with Lieutenant Commander Harold O. Larson in command.\n\n\"Pringle\" was one of the three s to be built (out of 6 planned) with a catapult for a float plane. The catapult and an aircraft crane were located just aft of the number 2 smokestack, in place of the after torpedo tube mount, 5-inch mount number 3, and the 2nd deck of the after deck house which normally carried a twin 40Â mm anti-aircraft gun on most ships of the class. (The twin 40Â mm mount was moved to the fantail, just forward of the depth charge racks, where most ships of the class carried 20Â mm mounts.) It was intended that the float plane be used for scouting for the destroyer flotilla to which the ship was attached. It would be launched by the catapult, land on the water next to the ship, and be recovered by the aircraft crane. \"Pringle\" was the first of five ships that eventually received the catapult to use it operationally. Due to design problems with the derrick, \"Pringle\" could not recover the Kingfisher airplane. Two ships constructed in 1943, and , had redesigned derricks. \"Stevens\" became the first of the five ships to successfully launch and recover the plane. All were ultimately converted to the standard Fletcher-class configuration.\n\nFollowing shakedown, \"Pringle\" joined convoy ON 154 in mid-Atlantic 1 January 1943 to escort the Halifax-bound contingent. While on this duty she was the first U.S. destroyer to use an aircraft with catapult. The float plane was catapulted off to search for enemy submarines. Recovery of the plane in the prevailing weather for a ship the size of \"Pringle\" was difficult.\n\nOn 6 February, she got underway for the Pacific Theater, escorting the British aircraft carrier from Norfolk Navy Yard to the Pacific. Arriving off Guadalcanal on 30 May, she took up patrol duties off the Solomons, and, on the night of 17/18 July, joined and in attacking three Japanese destroyers off Vanga Point, Kolombangara. Scoring several torpedo hits, she also shot down one Japanese plane.\n\nAs the Solomon Islands campaign continued into August, \"Pringle\" screened advance units of the Vella Lavella assault force, escorted LSTs through Gizo strait, and on the 24th covered minelaying operations off Kolombangara under Japanese guns. On the night of 3/4 September, \"Pringle\" with made a sweep of Japanese barges between Gambi Head, Choiseul, and Kolombangara, sinking three.\n\nWhile escorting Task Group 31.7 into Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville, on 11 November, 10 days after the initial landing there, \"Pringle\" shot down one Japanese plane and damaged another. With the exception of a run to Sydney in late January 1944, she continued to operate in the Solomons for the next few months. She swept the southwest coast of Bougainville during daylight in early March, bombarding enemy installations and beached barges.\n\nThe Marianas operation produced another long period of bombardment, screening and anti-submarine missions for \"Pringle\". During the assaults on Saipan and Tinian, she conducted fire support operations. She then returned to San Francisco, California, for refit and to rest her crew.\n\nAfter overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, \"Pringle\" sailed for Pearl Harbor on 19 October. She departed Pearl Harbor on 10 November for the Philippines to take part in the upcoming invasion. From 27 to 28 November, she bombarded enemy shore positions near Ormoc Bay, Leyte, shooting down a Japanese plane on the same day. On 28 November, she and \"Saufley\", \"Waller\", and combined to sink .\n\n\"Pringle\" came under her most intense air attack while escorting a re-supply echelon to Mindoro from 27 to 30 December. Several ships in the convoy were sunk, while \"Pringle\" shot down two planes. On the 30th, a \"kamikaze\" crashed into her after deckhouse, killing 11 men and injuring 20, totally destroying one 40Â mm mount and damaging two 5-inch mounts.\n\nBack in service in February, \"Pringle\" screened transports to Iwo Jima for the assault there on the 17th, then provided fire support for the Marines ashore. Returning to Ulithi on 4 March, she prepared for the assault on Okinawa.\n\nOperating with Destroyer Division 90, she screened transport areas, covered minesweepers, and provided support fire. Assigned to radar picket duty on 15 April, she shot down two \"kamikazes\" on 16 April 1945 before a third crashed into her bridge, and plowed through the superstructure deck, abaft the base of number one stack. A single 1,000-pound bomb, or two 500-pounders, penetrated the main and superstructure decks and exploded with a violent eruption, buckling the keel and splitting the vessel in two at the forward fire room. Six minutes later, 258 survivors watched \"Pringle\" slide beneath the surface.\n\n\"Pringle\" earned 10 battle stars for World War II service.\n\n\n3.

Although a composite of many architectural styles, it is generally considered the largest Mission Revival Style building in the United States. Mission Inn Hotel & Spa is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\nThe owners are Duane and Kelly Roberts. Kelly serves as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Mission Inn, overseeing its daily operations.\n\nThe property began as a quaint adobe boarding house called \"The Glenwood Cottage\", built by engineer/surveyor Christopher Columbus Miller and on November 22, 1876, the Millers took their first paying guest. In February 1880, Miller's son Frank Augustus Miller purchased the hotel and land from his father. It blossomed into a full-service hotel in the early 1900s due to California's economic citrus boom and warm weather, attracting wealthy travelers and investors from East Coast and Europe. In 1902, Frank changed the name to the \"Glenwood Mission Inn\" and started building, in a variety of styles, until he died in 1935.\n\nMiller's vision for the eclectic structure was drawn from many historical design periods, revivals, influences, and styles. Some are Spanish Gothic architecture, Mission Revival Style architecture, Moorish Revival architecture, Spanish Colonial style architecture, Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture, Renaissance Revival architecture, and Mediterranean Revival Style architecture. With one section over another, addition upon addition, the result is a complicated and intricately built structure. It contains narrow passageways, exterior arcades, a medieval-style clock, a five-story rotunda, numerous patios and windows, castle towers, minarets, a Cloister Wing (with catacombs), flying buttresses, Mediterranean domes and a pedestrian sky bridge among many other features.\n\nDuring the 30-year construction period, Miller traveled the world, collecting treasures to bring back to the hotel for display.\n\nThe St. Francis Chapel houses four large, stained-glass windows and two original mosaics by Louis Comfort Tiffany in 1906. The windows were salvaged from the Madison Square Presbyterian Church and the chapel purpose built to house them. The Mexican-Baroque styled \"Rayas Altar\" is 25 feet tall by 16 feet across, carved from cedar and completely covered in gold leaf. For his \"Garden of Bells,\" Miller collected over 800 bells, including one dating from the year 1247 described as the \"oldest bell in Christendom.\"\n\nIn 1932, Frank Miller opened the St. Francis Atrio. The \"Famous Fliers' Wall\", added by Miller's son-in-law DeWitt Hutchings, was used to recognize notable aviators, including Amelia Earhart. On March 20, 1942, World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker was honored at the Inn, becoming the fifty-seventh flier added to the monument. Today, 151 fliers or groups of fliers are honored by having their signatures etched onto copper wings attached to the wall.\n\nFrank Miller died in 1935 and the Inn continued under the management of his daughter and son-in-law, Allis and DeWitt Hutchings, who died in 1956. The Inn then went through a series of ownership changes and some of its older rooms were converted to apartments and used as dorms for UC Riverside. In the early 1960s, St. John's College considered buying it as a location for its western campus but abandoned negotiations when John Gaw Meem donated land in Santa Fe.\n\nThe hotel was later acquired by the Carley Capital Group and was closed for renovations in 1985. Newly discovered structural problems cost more than expected and caused the company to fall behind on loan payments to a New York bank. This caused work on the nearly completed hotel to be halted, just weeks before its planned opening in December 1988 as the Omni Mission Inn. In December 1992, the Inn was sold to Duane Roberts, a Riverside businessman. Roberts completed the renovations and it was reopened to the public shortly thereafter.\n\nWith its widely varying styles, the Mission Inn was designed by multiple architects. Frank Miller selected Arthur B. Benton to design the original building. Miller chose Myron Hunt to design the Spanish Wing added to the rear of the main building. He later hired G. Stanley Wilson to design the St. Francis Chapel. Wilson also added a rotunda featuring circular staircases and a dome.\n\nFor 140 years, the Mission Inn has been the center of Riverside, host to U.S. Presidents, celebrities, a number of seasonal and holiday functions, as well as occasional political functions and other major social gatherings. Pat and Richard Nixon were married in what is now the Presidential Lounge, Nancy and Ronald Reagan honeymooned there, and eight other U.S. Presidents have visited the Inn: Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Gerald Ford, and George W. Bush.\n\nSocial leaders who have stopped at the Mission Inn include Susan B. Anthony, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Huntington, Albert Einstein, Joseph Pulitzer, William Randolph Hearst, Hubert H. Bancroft, Harry Chandler, Booker T. Washington, Helen Keller and John Muir.\n\nThe list of entertainers who have toured the Inn is extensive. Lillian Russell, Sarah Bernhardt and Harry Houdini were early visitors to Frank Miller's hotel. Other guests have included actors such as Ethel Barrymore, Charles Boyer, Eddie Cantor, Mary Pickford, Ginger Rogers, Bette Davis (who was married at the Inn in 1945), W. C. Fields, Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Fess Parker, James Brolin and Barbra Streisand, Raquel Welch and Drew Barrymore. Other celebrities such as Jack Benny, Bob Hope, Glen Campbell, Merle Haggard and Tears for Fears have stopped by.\n\nThe Inn continues to be a getaway for notable individuals to this day. Arnold Schwarzenegger has stayed there during his tenure as Governor of California and the Osbournes have also paid a visit in the past few years.\n\nThe hotel, which occupies an entire city block, has 4 restaurants, a day spa and 239 guest rooms (nine rooms designated as presidential suites). It is a National Historic Landmark, a California Historical Landmark, and Riverside City Landmark #1. The hotel's aesthetic charm makes it a frequent subject for local artists.\n\nThe hotel features four restaurants and two lounges.\n\nIn 1909 Carrie Jacobs-Bond wrote the lyrics for her famous song \"A Perfect Day\" while staying in the Mission Inn. For many years the Mission Inn's carillon played \"A Perfect Day\" as the last tune each evening. In 2016, the Mission Inn announced the return of daily performances of \"A Perfect Day\" as part of its commitment to preserve the history of the hotel.\n\nAmerican author Anne Rice so enjoyed the Inn she incorporated it into her 2009 book \"Angel Time\". The book is the first in Rice's \"Songs of the Seraphim\" series, which tells the story of Toby O'Dare, an assassin with a tragic past, who uses the Mission Inn as his refuge. Similarly, American author John Van Vlear featured the Inn in his 2012 novel \"Treachery at Torrey Pines: A Shank MacDuff Mystery.\" Van Vlear relays a memorable lunch at the Inn during which the golf-caddy hero picks the brain of his retired father who used to work in the banking industry as a security analyst.\n\nThe Inn's unique architecture and ambiance have attracted many film makers. Film shoots at the Inn include 1938's \"Idiot's Delight\" with Clark Gable, 1969's \"Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here\" with Robert Redford, 1975's The Wild Party with Raquel Welch and James Coco, Billy Wilder's 1981 comedy \"Buddy Buddy\" with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, 1988's \"Vibes\" with Jeff Goldblum, 1977's \"Black Samurai\" with Jim Kelly, and 1998's \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" with Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nThe Mission Inn was featured in a \"Traveltalks\" short subject by James A. Fitzpatrick, in the 1944 episode, \"\"Along the Cactus Trail\"\"\n\nIn 1982, Eddie Money filmed the music video of \"Think I'm In Love\" at the Inn.\n\nThe \"Sliders\" season 3 episodes 16 and 17 (\"Exodus\", parts I and II) were shot extensively in the Mission Inn, which played as a military base.\n\nThe finale of the 1973-74 TV series \"The Magician\" season 1 episode \"Man on Fire\" was shot extensively in the Mission Inn, which was supposedly \"under renovation\".\n\nThe Mission Inn Museum promotes the cultural heritage of the Mission Inn. It is operated by the Mission Inn Foundation, an independent nonprofit organization (Tax ID 51-0205032). A permanent exhibition features the history of the inn as well as inland Southern California history. The main gallery hosts changing exhibitions which rotate 2-3 times per year. The museum offers educational programs and daily guided tours. Specialty tours on the Women of the Mission Inn, the hotel's fine art collection, photography tours, and architecture tours are offered on a quarterly basis. The Hands On History Outreach Program is an award-winning educational workshop series that provides opportunities for middle school students to connect with their local heritage through oral history interviews, photography, technology, and public speaking. Youth Ambassadors is a high school docent program which encourages civic engagement, leadership, and confidence in youth ages 15â18. The daily guided tours are the museum's most popular attraction, hosting over 20,000 guests per year.\n\n\n\n"}

Larson worked in television and radio news from the 1970s to 1990s and has hosted \"The Lars Larson Show\" from flagship station KXL in Portland since 1997. Two versions of the show exist: the Northwest show airs from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. (Pacific) and discussing Pacific Northwest issues. The Northwest show is syndicated on the Radio Northwest Network which is owned and operated by Alpha Media. The nationally syndicated program airs from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. (Pacific) and discusses national issues. The national show is syndicated by Compass Media Networks.\n\nLarson began his broadcasting career at age 16, at KTIL in his hometown of Tillamook, Oregon, learning his trade under Mildred Davy. He later became an announcer at Eugene-based KWAX. From 1977 to 1979, Larson attended the University of Oregon in Eugene, but quit \"after just a year to work in radio and television\". Larson served as news director for KATR in Eugene from 1977 to 1978 and KBDF from 1978 to 1979 with internships at KEZI television and KPNW radio. He was later news director at KZEL in Eugene before moving to KJRB in Spokane, Washington in 1979 to be a reporter. While in Spokane, Larson took classes at Gonzaga University.\n\nIn 1980, Larson moved to Portland, Oregon, and KXL for what would become the first of two positions. Larson did the afternoon news. In 1983, he moved back to Eugene and was a reporter and eventually anchor for KVAL-TV. In 1985, Larson moved back to Portland, when he was hired by KPTV as a reporter for \"The 10 O'Clock News\".\n\nIn 1988, he hosted a weekend talk show on KEX and transferred to KGW, where he would stay from 1989 to 1991.\n\nIn 1992, he helped to create the KPTV news magazine program \"Northwest Reports\", a weekly one-hour show which debuted in September of that year. Previously, since at least 1990, KPTV had aired documentaries or investigative stories under the name \"Northwest Reports with Lars Larson\" as segments within regular newscasts or occasionally as one-time specials, but not as a regular program. For the new weekly show, Larson was both executive producer and on-air anchor. It was a \"\"60 Minutes\"-style investigative show\" but focused on the Portland area and the Northwest. The program won a regional Emmy Award for a story that exposed careless handling of customers' private financial information by certain local banks.\n\n\"The Oregonian\" reported that \"Northwest Reports\" had \"decent ratings\" against \"strong network competition\", but not enough to attract sufficient advertising revenue. The program lasted more than four years, but was canceled in fall 1996, after which Larson resumed anchor duties on KPTV's \"10 O'Clock News\". In his radio career, Larson moved back to KXL in 1997, this time hosting a talk show, \"The Lars Larson Show\", which aired from noon to 4 p.m.\n\nAfter continuing to anchor the news for KPTV until 1998, Larson left the station in November of that year, \"after months of pressure from station management over his other role as an outspoken radio talk-show host\" on KXL. KPTV management viewed his radio talk-show role as a conflict of interest with his role as a news anchor. He later began working at KOIN TV, hosting a morning program \"The Buzz\" until 2000.\n\nOn January 31, 2000, \"The Lars Larson Show\" began airing on nine radio stations (currently 17) via \"The Radio Northwest Network\". In 2002, Larson was listed in \"Talkers Magazine\"'s Heavy Hundred (the most important radio hosts of 4,000 nationwide) for the first time. In July 2003, Larson began filling in for Talk Radio Network talk host Michael Savage. On August 14, 2003, Larson was hired by Westwood One Radio Network to host his own show for national syndication. \"The Lars Larson Show\" officially debuted on Westwood One on September 1, 2003, with 105 affiliates and grew to 175 affiliates. On March 19, 2009, Westwood One canceled \"The Lars Larson Show\". Larson's national network show re-launched on newly formed Compass Media Networks on March 30, 2009.\n\nOn October 15, 2007, Larson requested that the Oregon State Bar Association investigate whether then Governor of Oregon Ted Kulongoski lied about having knowledge about the sexual abuse of a 14-year-old girl by ex-Governor of Oregon Neil Goldschmidt in the 1970s. Kulongoski, a lawyer, has denied knowing anything about Goldschmidt having sex with an underage girl. In a story reported in \"The Oregonian\" in June 2004, however, former Goldschmidt speechwriter Fred Leonhardt said he told Kulongoski about the abuse as far back as 1994, 10 years before Goldschmidt publicly admitted to it. Larson wants the state bar to determine if Kulongoski lied about the matter, and whether his bar license should be suspended or revoked. After an investigation, the state bar determined that both Kulongowski and Leonhardt were \"credible\" in their accounts of the matter, and closed the investigation for want of sufficient evidence to continue. Larson appealed the decision, calling it contradictory; upon appeal, the decision was upheld. The general counsel to the bar wrote an email to Larson stating that \"given the directly contradictory accounts of the parties and the total absence of any other evidence, I cannot conclude that there is sufficient evidence to form a reasonable belief that misconduct may have occurred\", noting that the only evidence against Kulongoski was the testimony of Leonhardt. She added that \"it is indisputable that memories fade with time and that two people can walk away from the same conversation with very different ideas of what was said.\" Larson has accused the state bar of having \"swept this matter under the rug\".\n\nLarson is a proponent for stopping all illegal immigration to the United States and greatly increasing requirements for immigrants to become citizens, such as learning to read, write, and speak English. Larson opposed President Barack Obama's health care reform, commonly known as Obamacare. The second amendment, and citizen's right to bear arms is one of his most frequent topics, and he is a member of the board of directors for the Crime Prevention Research Center, a research and education organization dedicated to conducting research on the relationship between laws regulating the ownership or use of guns, crime, and public safety.\n\nLarson was born in Taipei, Taiwan. His father served in the United States Navy, and when he began a career in forestry, the Larson family lived in Montana, California (Happy Camp, Somes Bar, and Dorris), and Klamath Falls, Oregon, before settling in Tillamook, Oregon, when Lars was a teenager. Lars has one sister, Patty Schild, of Sisters, Oregon. He graduated from Tillamook High School, where he had been on the speech and debate team. In the early 1990s, he was married to Debb Janes, a Portland radio personality. In 1997, Larson married Tina Larson. They live in Vancouver, Washington.\n\nIn December 2005, Larson declared on-air that he was protesting the renaming of the traditional Christmas tree placed in Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square a \"Holiday Tree\" by placing his own Christmas Cross in the square. The idea was reversed because of legal concerns for his flagship station.\n\nOn March 18, 2008, in the context of a discussion about Jeremiah Wright, Barack Obama and U.S. policy toward Israel, Larson called former president Jimmy Carter an anti-Semite on CNN's \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\".\n\n\n"}

The company is best known as a manufacturer of narrow and standard gauge diesel locomotives and also of steam shovels. Other products included cars, steam locomotives and a range of internal combustion engines, and later gas turbines. It is now a subsidiary of Siemens.\n\nProctor & Burton was established in 1840, operating as millwrights and engineers. It became Ruston, Proctor and Company in 1857 when Joseph Ruston joined them, acquiring limited liability status in 1899. From 1866 it built a number of four and six-coupled tank locomotives, one of which was sent to the Paris Exhibition in 1867. In 1868 it built five 0-6-0 tank engines for the Great Eastern Railway to the design of Samuel Waite Johnson. Three of these were converted to crane tanks, two of which lasted until 1952, aged eighty-four. Among the company's output were sixteen for Argentina and some for T. A. Walker, the contractor building the Manchester Ship Canal.\n\nDuring the First World War, Ruston assisted in the war effort, producing some of the very first tanks and a number of aircraft, notably the Sopwith Camel.\n\n \n\nOn 11 September 1918, Ruston, Proctor and Company merged with Richard Hornsby & Sons of Grantham to become Ruston and Hornsby Ltd (R&H). Hornsby was the world leader in heavy oil engines, having been building them since 1891, a full eight years before Rudolph Diesel's engine was produced commercially.\n\nRuston built oil and diesel engines in sizes from a few HP up to large industrial engines. Several R&H engines are on display at the Anson Engine Museum at Poynton, Manchester and also at Internal Fire - Museum of Power, Tanygroes near Cardigan. The company also diversified into the manufacture of petrol engines, again from around 1.5Â hp upwards, some of these designs were later manufactured under licence by The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company.\n\nThe firm were builders of steam engines and portable steam engines for many years, mainly for the agricultural market; however, they also created steam rollers which were used for making roads and owned by contractors and councils.\n\nIn World War 1, the company made around 2,750 aeroplanes and 3,000 aero engines. The 1,000th Sopwith Camel (B7380), built at the plant in 1917, was named the \"Wings of Horus\". The company built around 1,600 Sopwith Camels, 250 Sopwith 1Â½ Strutters, and 200 Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s. The company, as Ruston & Proctor, was the largest British builder of aero-engines in the war, and built the largest bomb of the war. One of the directors, Frederick Howard Livens, had a son who was an army officer on the front line. Captain William Howard Livens was sent to Lincoln, where he developed the Livens Projector and the Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector.\n\nNeighbouring manufacturer Clayton & Shuttleworth also built planes.\n\nIn 1919, Colonel J.S. Ruston was inspired to create a garden suburb in Lincoln â the Swanpool Garden Suburb. His vision was to provide affordable houses for his workers, with easy access to healthy outdoor recreation, such as a pleasure ground, cricket ground and swimming baths. Ruston purchased 25 acres of the Boultham Hall estate and established the Swanpool Co-operative Society. Architects Hennell and James of London created the designs for the houses, which were built between April 1919 and September 1920. The vision for the new suburb included a technical institute, church and schools. After running into financial difficulties the development was sold in 1925 to Swanpool Garden Suburb Ltd, a private company, but only 113 of the planned 2â3000 houses had been constructed and no more were built.\n\nAfter World War I the company attempted to diversify and one outcome was the Ruston-Hornsby car. Two versions were made, a 15.9Â hp with a Dorman 2614Â cc engine and a larger 20Â hp model with 3308Â cc engine of their own manufacture. The cars were, however, very heavy, being built on a 9-inch chassis, and extremely expensive â the cheapest was around Â£440 and the most expensive nearly Â£1,000, and within a few years other makers were selling similar vehicles that weighed only 3/4 ton and cost around Â£120â200 â and never reached the hoped-for production volumes. About 1,500 were made between 1919 and 1924, two of which are still retained by Siemens on the Lincoln site. One is fully restored in running/driving condition, while the second example is still awaiting attention.\n\nThe R-H car was developed by the chief engineer, Edward Boughton, who joined the company in 1916 after helping to develop the tank. Later he would start the Automotive Products Group (APG) in Leamington Spa in 1920 which made Borg & Beck clutches, Lockheed hydraulic brakes, and Purolator fuel filters.\n\nIn September 1944, when the German Wehrmacht OB West headquarters at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (near Paris) were captured, previously commanded by Field Marshal GÃ¼nther von Kluge (from 2 July 1944), they were found to be powered by Ruston diesel engines.\n\nIt built the first prototype of the Valiant tank in 1944. The Grantham site built the Matilda II tank.\n\nRuston & Hornsby was a major producer of small and medium diesel engines for land and marine applications. The company began to build diesel locomotives in 1931 (and continued up until 1967). It was a pioneer and major developer in the industrial application of small (up to 10,000Â kW) heavy duty gas turbines from the 1950s onwards. In the 1960s it was Europe's leading supplier of land-based gas turbines. It introduced Dry Low Emission (DLE) combustion technology in the mid-1990s becoming market leaders.\n\nThe initiation of the production and design of gas turbines was largely due to Bob Feilden CBE (1917â2004) who joined the company in 1946. Gas turbines were first produced in 1952.\n\nThe Beevor Foundry on Beevor Street was opened in 1950 by General Sir William Joseph Slim (later Field Marshal William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim), and claimed to be the biggest foundry in Europe.\n\nIn the 1950s, it was producing one turbine a fortnight. The company sold its 1,000th gas turbine in July 1977. It won the MacRobert Award in December 1983 for the Tornado gas turbine. The company's Cambridge-educated Egyptian chairman, Dr Waheeb Rizk OBE, was concurrently President of the IMechE from 1984-5 and also President of the International Council on Combustion Engines from 1973-77. He was Managing Director from 1971â83 and developed the \"W layout\" for gas turbine power stations that were used as emergency generating stations for the National Grid, also known as peaking power plants. These had to be developed due to prolonged electricity blackouts in south-east England in 1961 caused by cascading failure. It built the first gas turbine to burn North Sea gas, for the Eastern Gas Board in Watford. In 1981 it won an order to power the UrengoyâPomaryâUzhgorod pipeline (Trans-Siberian Pipeline).\n\nResearch work was done in conjunction with the University of Sussex and with Cranfield University in the 1980s, where extensive development was undertaken of the combustion chamber and of the gallery to the turbine.\n\nIndustrial Gas Turbines of note manufactured at the Lincoln plant:\n\nUntil the late 1960s, it produced \"Thermax\" boilers. The boiler business was sold for Â£1.75m to Cochrane & Co of Annan, Dumfries and Galloway in October 1968, that was bought by John Thompson of Wolverhampton four months later. It was bought by Clarke Chapman in 1970.\n\nIn 1957, it was the first company to fit a main Royal Navy ship (HMS \"Cumberland\") with a (experimental) gas turbine.\n\nIn 1959, it opened a new type of power plant using waste sewage gas that powered eight turbines at Britain's biggest sewage works at the Northern Outfall Sewer at Beckton in East London. This was an 18,000 horsepower combined heat and power plant.\n\nThe company pioneered combined heat and power schemes. The company began this technology in Cortemaggiore, Emilia-Romagna in 1956 at the Agip (Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli) oil refinery. By the late 1960s, Ruston & Hornsby CHP units were installed in Australia, Germany, the US, South America, and the Middle East.\n\nIn the 1970s, these CHP schemes were not as well developed as today because electricity companies were not interested in developing a market that would provide direct competition to themselves. CHP schemes were then known as \"total energy schemes\", which comprised \"exhaust heat recovery\". The company won the Queen's Award for Enterprise: International Trade (Export) in 1977, 1978 and 1982.\n\nThe large Singer factory in Clydebank, which employed 11,000 people, was notably powered by Rustons turbines. The King Faisal Specialist Hospital was installed with a CHP unit in 1975. Whitehall in London is heated and has its electricity from a CHP unit built in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1940 R&H bought a controlling interest in the well-known Paxman diesel engine company of Colchester in Essex. In the later stages of the war, Paxman built 4,000 diesel engines that powered all the British-built tank landing craft (LCT) on D-Day. It supplied diesel engines for British Rail locomotives in the 1960s. From 1954-64 the company's Managing Director was Geoffrey Bone who had been part of the Power Jets team, and whose father Victor Bone was Managing Director of R&H from 1944 until his death. It was due to Geoffrey Bone that Bob Feilden was recruited for R&H who subsequently formed the gas turbine manufacturing operations.\n\nIn 1934 the company had formed Aveling-Barford from two companies Aveling & Porter of Kent and Barford & Perkins of Peterborough, using a former site of R&H. The company closed its Grantham diesel-engine factory in 1963.\n\nIn November 1966, R&H was purchased by English Electric. Robert Inskip, 2nd Viscount Caldecote became Chairman of the company. Subsidiaries of R&H included Bergius-Kelvin of Glasgow, Davey, Paxman & Co of Colchester (now owned by MAN) and Alfred Wiseman Gears in Grantham.\n\nUp to that point, the company had been listed on the London Stock Exchange. This formed Britain's second largest diesel engine group, second to Hawker-Lister. From that moment on it was a subsidiary of a larger company. It became known as the Ruston Turbine Division of English Electric Diesels.\n\nFollowing the acquisition by English Electric the production of large Ruston engines was moved to the English Electric Vulcan Foundry factory in Newton-le-Willows. The production of the smaller engine range was moved to Stafford where it became a part of the Dorman Diesel range. Turbine technology was concentrated in Lincoln with Napier turbochargers moving from Liverpool to Lincoln in 1967. In 1969 the Lincoln site became Ruston Gas Turbines. The name was then changed to European Gas Turbines in 1989 following the merger of GEC and Alcatel Alsthom. Later this business was sold to Siemens. The gas turbine business is still located in the old Ruston factory in the centre of Lincoln.\n\nR&H was included in the purchase of English Electric by the General Electric Company (GEC) in 1968. By the end of 1969 the Lincoln subsidiary company was known as Ruston Gas Turbines.\n\nThe Ruston Paxman diesels division became known as Ruston Diesels, and moved to the former English Electric diesel works. The former Power Jets plant at Whetstone became a research plant for the gas turbine division of GEC. GEC then merged its heavy engineering division with Alsthom of France, becoming part of GEC-Alsthom in 1989, which changed its name to Alstom in 1998, when the Lincoln subsidiary was known as EGT (European Gas Turbines).\n\nIn 2003, Alstom sold its gas turbine division (in Lincoln and Franche-ComtÃ©) to Siemens. The site of the former headquarters at Thorngate House, on the opposite side of the A15, was redeveloped as residential flats.\n\nWhen owned by GEC in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many (if not the vast majority) of Lincoln engineering firms did not survive difficult financial conditions. This included Clayton Dewandre, (that made vacuum and air-pressure brake servos and associated equipment for commercial vehicles). WH Dorman had been bought by English Electric in 1961 and took over an old R&H factory on Beevor Street. Dormans would be bought by Perkins in 1993, then closed in 1995.\n\nOnly the GEC group of companies in Lincoln (including Dormans) survived the 1970s. The company actually expanded during this difficult time, helped by the fact that 80% of its engines were exported and the North Sea oil industry was rapidly expanding at this time, which required portable electricity generation and heating.\n\nThe original Ruston works (Waterside South, Lincoln) focused on Gas Turbine manufacture from 1967 becoming the head office of Ruston Gas Turbines. Napier Turbochargers, that had been owned by English Electric since 1942, moved to the site from Liverpool.\n\nWith the change of ownership in 1989 the name was changed to European Gas Turbines Ltd. Following a spell as Alstom Gas Turbines Ltd, the company is now known as Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery Ltd.\n\nThe design and research centre in Lincoln opened in May 1957. Its gas turbines are still manufactured in the Ruston Works in Lincoln and widely used around the world. Siemens announced in September 2009 that Gas Turbine packaging operations were to move abroad with the Lincoln site becoming a feeder plant.\n\nTechnically, Ruston & Hornsby Ltd existed at the Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows in Merseyside until 2002, which was known as Ruston Diesels (former Ruston Paxman Diesels). It was taken over by MAN Diesel on 12 June 2000.\n\nRustons â in its various incarnations â was always an engine producer rather than a machine producer, and it could be considered that they simply produced machines in order to sell engines.\n\nHeritage railways with Ruston & Hornsby locomotives include :\n\nAustralia\n\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance\nIndonesia\nNew Zealand\nNorway\nUnited Kingdom\n\nPreserved marine engines include :\n\n\n\n"}

The hindwings are plainer, grey or buffish brown. The wingspan is . It exhibits sexual dimorphism, the male usually being smaller but more strongly marked than the female. Usually, the forewing ground colour is brownish in females and decidedly green in males, but there are many exceptions.

The enabling legislation was one of several unsuccessful attempts to help the declining New Zealand economy after the oil shocks of the late 1970sâother such policies included the Think Big strategy.\n\nIn this scheme, the owners of all private petrol-powered motor vehicles under , with the exception of motorcycles, were required to refrain from using their car on one day of the week, that day being designated by the owner. Thursday was the most frequently chosen day. Each car displayed a coloured sticker on its windscreen which noted the day on which it could not be used, and infringements were punishable by a hefty fine (stickers were different colours, depending on which day of the week they displayed). Other restrictions were also brought in, including reducing the open-road speed limit from to and restricting the hours that petrol could be sold at service stations and garages.\n\nThe first person fined was Gordon Marks of Christchurch, who forgot that at 3.45 am after a post-party nap in his car his \"car-less day\" had started at 2 am. He was fined $50 rather than the $400 maximum fine. Journalist Richard Griffin said that \"it was a bit like drunk driving - if you could get away with it you did. There was no stigma attached ...\n\nThe carless days scheme was highly unpopular, and largely ineffective. It lasted less than a year, being scrapped in May 1980, though the 80Â km/h limit remained for several years. The legislation was a failure for a number of reasons. Most importantly, exemptions were allowed, indicated by an exemption sticker. A black market for exemption stickers and imitations of them quickly developed, rendering the scheme unworkable. There was also a distinct problem in inequalityâhouseholds that could afford to run two cars could simply choose different days for the two cars and continue to drive on all seven days as before. In addition, there is anecdotal evidence of people driving considerably greater mileages to achieve their daily travel needs on days they had the use of one car rather than two.\n"}

The company is headquartered in Beijing, and is engaged in both manufacture and retail sales, operating drug stores predominantly in Chinese-speaking regions. Tong Ren Tang is considered one of the \"Big 4\" traditional Chinese medicine brands still in existence. The four companies include (listed in order of age not size): Guangyuyuan (1541 AD), Guangzhou Chen Liji (1600 AD), Beijing Tong Ren Tang (1669), and Hangzhou Hu Qing Yu Tang (1874). Tong Ren Tang and GuangYuYuan have been officially recognized as \"China Time-Honored Brands\" by the Ministry of Commerce of the Peopleâs Republic of China.\n\nIn 1669, the eighth year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Tong Ren Tang was established in Beijing by Yue Xianyang who served as a senior physician at the Qing imperial court. In 1702, the company relocated within Beijing to the address from which it has operated ever since. In 1723, Tong Ren Tang was appointed the sole supplier of herbal medicines to the imperial court by the Yongzheng Emperor and remained in that position until the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911.\nIn 1924, the company Tiger bone wine was awarded at the Leipzig Trade Fair, making the product the most popular type in commerce.\n\nLike many older Chinese companies, Tong Ren Tang has struggled to adapt to market changes. In recent years, Tong Ren Tang has modernized its facilities, and changed its trade name to Tongrentang. It remains one of the oldest surviving brand names for traditional Chinese medicine, and has wide name-recognition among Chinese and Asians worldwide. It is also one of the world's largest TCM companies, with products sold in countries all over the world.\n\nHutchison Whampoa Ltd. invested in Tong Ren Tang Technologiesâ in 2000 by subscribing six million shares in the company. Page 17 of Prospectus Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., previously had two joint ventures with Tong Ren Tang. Page 6 of Prospectus\n\nIn 2004, Tong Ren Tang invested 150 million Hong Kong dollars in the construction of a manufacturing plant in Hong Kong.\n\nIn October 2007, Tong Ren Tang and an American company called Greater China Corporation jointly announced the formation of a partnership under the name Tong Ren Tang Wellness Corporation to \"develop spa-like wellness centers that will provide treatments and products based upon China's famous TongRenTang herbal medicines. These will include acupuncture, massage, acupressure, Tuina, T'ai chi, Qigong, reflexology and many other oriental treatments as well as a full line of herbal foods and health products\".\n\nIn 2001, Tong Ren Tang, in collaboration with Germany-based Mirahi Biotech, diversified into skincare products. Using state-of-the-art western technologies and the vast cache of herbal medicines of Tong Ren Tang, the collaboration has come up with an impressive list of products. In 2008, the exclusive U.S. distributorship is licensed to a California corporation, Denosim Incorporated, and the products are being distributed by MIRAHI Skincare, Inc., San Jose, California, USA.\n\nTongrentang's products are often counterfeited both inside and outside China. China's Ministry of Commerce notes that \"Tongrentang ... and others have had their names and brands illegally registered by other Chinese and overseas manufacturers, resulting in a predicament in exports, multinational exchanges and potential economic losses.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1928276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928276", "title": "Intelligent Platform Management Interface", "text": "Intelligent Platform Management Interface\n\nThe Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a set of computer interface specifications for an autonomous computer subsystem that provides management and monitoring capabilities independently of the host system's CPU, firmware (BIOS or UEFI) and operating system. IPMI defines a set of interfaces used by system administrators for out-of-band management of computer systems and monitoring of their operation. For example, IPMI provides a way to manage a computer that may be powered off or otherwise unresponsive by using a network connection to the hardware rather than to an operating system or login shell. Another use case may be installing a custom operating system remotely. Without IPMI, installing a custom operating system may require an administrator to be physically present near the computer, insert a DVD or a USB flash drive containing the OS installer and complete the installation process using a monitor and a keyboard. Using IPMI, an administrator can mount an ISO image, simulate an installer DVD, and perform the installation remotely.\n\nThe specification is led by Intel and was first published on September 16, 1998. It is supported by more than 200 computer system vendors, such as Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intel, Marvell Semiconductor, NEC Corporation, SuperMicro and Tyan.\n\nUsing a standardized interface and protocol allows systems-management software based on IPMI to manage multiple, disparate servers. As a message-based, hardware-level interface specification, IPMI operates independently of the operating system (OS) to allow administrators to manage a system remotely in the absence of an operating system or of the system management software. Thus IPMI functions can work in any of three scenarios:\n\n\nSystem administrators can use IPMI messaging to monitor platform status (such as system temperatures, voltages, fans, power supplies and chassis intrusion); to query inventory information; to review hardware logs of out-of-range conditions; or to perform recovery procedures such as issuing requests from a remote console through the same connections e.g. system power-down and rebooting, or configuring watchdog timers. The standard also defines an alerting mechanism for the system to send a simple network management protocol (SNMP) platform event trap (PET).\n\nThe monitored system may be powered off, but must be connected to a power source and to the monitoring medium, typically a local area network (LAN) connection. IPMI can also function after the operating system has started, and exposes management data and structures to the system management software. IPMI prescribes only the structure and format of the interfaces as a standard, while detailed implementations may vary. An implementation of IPMI version 1.5 can communicate via a direct out-of-band local area network (LAN) or serial connection or via a side-band local area network (LAN) connection to a remote client. The side-band LAN connection utilizes the board network interface controller (NIC). This solution is less expensive than a dedicated LAN connection but also has limited bandwidth.\n\nSystems compliant with IPMI version 2.0 can also communicate via serial over LAN, whereby serial console output can be remotely viewed over the LAN. Systems implementing IPMI 2.0 typically also include KVM over IP, remote virtual media and out-of-band embedded web-server interface functionality, although strictly speaking, these lie outside of the scope of the IPMI interface standard.\n\nDCMI (Data Center Manageability Interface) is a similar standard based on IPMI but designed to be more suitable for Data Center management: it uses the interfaces defined in IPMI, but minimizes the number of optional interfaces and includes power capping control, among other differences.\n\nAs well as using a separate dedicated management LAN connection, IPMI also allows implementation of a so-called \"side-band\" management LAN connection. This connection utilizes a System Management Bus (SMBUS) interface between the BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) and the board Network Interface Controller (NIC). This solution has the advantage of reduced costs but also provides limited bandwidth sufficient for text console redirection but not for video redirection. For example, when a remote computer is down the system administrator can access it through IPMI and utilize a text console.\n\nThis suffices for a few vital functions, such as checking the event log, accessing the BIOS setup and performing power on, power off or power cycle. However, more advanced functions, such as remote re-installation of an operating system, may require a full out-of-band management approach utilizing a dedicated LAN connection.\n\nAn IPMI sub-system consists of a main controller, called the baseboard management controller (BMC) and other management controllers distributed among different system modules that are referred to as satellite controllers. The satellite controllers within the same chassis connect to the BMC via the system interface called Intelligent Platform Management Bus/Bridge (IPMB) an enhanced implementation of IÂ²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit). The BMC connects to satellite controllers or another BMC in another chassis via the Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) bus or bridge. It may be managed with the \"Remote Management Control Protocol\" (RMCP), a specialized wire protocol defined by this specification. RMCP+ (a UDP-based protocol with stronger authentication than RMCP) is used for IPMI over LAN.\n\nSeveral vendors develop and market BMC chips. A BMC utilized for embedded applications may have limited memory and require optimized firmware code for implementation of the full IPMI functionality. Highly integrated BMCs can provide complex instructions and provide the complete out-of-band functionality of a service processor. The firmware implementing the IPMI interfaces is provided by various vendors.\nA field replaceable unit (FRU) repository holds the inventory, such as vendor ID and manufacturer, of potentially replaceable devices. A sensor data record (SDR) repository provides the properties of the individual sensors present on the board. For example, the board may contain sensors for temperature, fan speed, and voltage.\n\nThe baseboard management controller (BMC) provides the intelligence in the IPMI architecture. It is a specialized microcontroller embedded on the motherboard of a computerÂ â generally a server. The BMC manages the interface between system-management software and platform hardware.\n\nDifferent types of sensors built into the computer system report to the BMC on parameters such as temperature, cooling fan speeds, power status, operating system (OS) status, etc.\nThe BMC monitors the sensors and can send alerts to a system administrator via the network if any of the parameters do not stay within pre-set limits, indicating a potential failure of the system. The administrator can also remotely communicate with the BMC to take some corrective actions â such as resetting or power cycling the system to get a hung OS running again. These abilities save on the total cost of ownership of a system.\n\nPhysical interfaces to the BMC include SMBuses, an RS-232 serial console, address and data lines and an Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB), that enables the BMC to accept IPMI request messages from other management controllers in the system.\n\nA direct serial connection to the BMC is not encrypted as the connection itself is secure. Connection to the BMC over LAN may or may not use encryption depending on the security concerns of the user.\n\nThere are rising concerns about general security regarding BMCs as a closed infrastructure. OpenBMC is a Linux Foundation Collaborative open-source BMC project.\n\nOn 2 July 2013, Rapid7 published a guide to security penetration testing of the latest IPMI 2.0 protocol and implementations by various vendors.\n\nSome sources in 2013 were advising against using the older version of IPMI, due to security concerns related to the design and vulnerabilities of Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs).\n\nHowever, like for any other management interface, best security practices dictate the placement of the IPMI management port on a dedicated management LAN or VLAN restricted to trusted Administrators.\n\nHowever, this is only of historical value. The IPMI specification has been updated with RAKP+ and a stronger cipher that is computationally impractical to break. Vendors as a result have provided patches that remediate these vulnerabilities.\n\nThe DMTF organization has developed a secure and scalable interface specification called Redfish to work in modern datacenter environments.\n\nSome potential solutions exist outside of the IPMI standard, depending on proprietary implementations. The use of default short passwords, or \"cipher 0\" hacks can be easily overcome with the use of a RADIUS server for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting over SSL as is typical in a datacenter or any medium to large deployment. The user's RADIUS server can be configured to store AAA securely in an LDAP database using either FreeRADIUS/OpenLDAP or Microsoft Active Directory and related services.\n\nRole-based access provides a way to respond to current and future security issues by increasing amounts of restriction for higher roles.\nRole-based access is supported with three roles available: Administrator, Operator and User.\n\nOverall, the User role has read-only access of the BMC and no remote control ability such as power cycle or the ability to view or log into the main CPU on the motherboard. Therefore, any hacker with the User role has zero access to confidential information, and zero control over the system. The User role is typically used to monitor sensor readings, after an SNMP alert has been received by SNMP Network Monitoring Software.\n\nThe Operator role is used in the rare event when a system is hung, to generate an NMI crash/core dump file and reboot or power cycle the system.\nIn such a case, the Operator will also have access to the system software to collect the crash/core dump file.\n\nThe Administrator role is used to configure the BMC on first boot during the commissioning of the system when first installed.\n\nTherefore, the prudent best practice is to disable the use of the Operator and Administrator roles in LDAP/RADIUS, and only enable them when needed by the LDAP/RADIUS administrator. For example, in RADIUS a role can have its setting Auth-Type changed to:\n\nDoing so will prevent RAKP hash attacks from succeeding since the username will be rejected by the RADIUS server.\n\nThe IPMI standard specification has evolved through a number of iterations:\n\n\n\n"}

Smith\n\nMichael Andrew Smith (born 23 July 1954) is an Australian philosopher who teaches at Princeton University (since September 2004). He taught previously at the University of Oxford, Monash University, and was a member of the Philosophy Program at the Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University. He is the author of a number of important books and articles in moral philosophy. In 2013, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nSmith earned his B.A. and M.A. in philosophy at Monash University, while his BPhil and DPhil were acquired at Oxford University under the direction of Simon Blackburn. He has held teaching appointments at various universities, including Wadham College, Oxford (1984), Monash (1984-5; 1989â94), Princeton (1985-9; 2004-present), and the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University (1995-2004).\n\nIn 2000, Smith's book \"The Moral Problem\" (1994) received The American Philosophical Association's first APA Book Prize for excellence in scholarship. Smith is considered to be one of the most important philosophers working in meta-ethics, and is one of the main proponents of a Neo-Humean approach to practical reason.\n\nIn \"The Moral Problem\" Smith diagnoses a longstanding tension between the apparent objectivity and practicality of moral judgments. The idea of moral objectivity is that \"it is a distinctive feature of engaging in moral practice that the participants are concerned to get the answers to moral questions \"right\".\" (1994 p.Â 5) Moral judgments are thought to be practical because they are thought to motivate those who accept them. But according to the Humean theory of motivation, a theory that Smith defends in chapter 4, it is not possible for a belief (a judgement about a matter of fact) to motivate someone without the presence of some antecedently held desire. Thus, if moral judgments are beliefs that motivate, they can only be beliefs about how to get something that we already want. But moral judgments, such as the judgment that murder is wrong, are not judgments about how to get something that we already want. Therefore, either they are not beliefs at all (and are therefore not objective) or they cannot motivate us (and are therefore not practical).\n\nHume famously claimed that reason is, and ought to be, only the slave of the passions. Humeans or Neo-Humeans do not typically hold strictly to Hume's views because, for one thing, they do not think of the passions in the same way that Hume did. Nonetheless, Humeans take their inspiration from Hume in claiming that reason alone is insufficient to motivate us to act. Often this claim is expressed in terms of beliefs and desires, and it is claimed that beliefs are mental states that are insufficient for motivation. Smith gives an analysis of action whereby in order for anything to count as an action at all, it must be explicable in terms of a belief-desire pair. He defends this account against objections by appeal to a dispositional conception of desire.\n\nIn later work, Smith gives an anti-Humean account of normative reasons. He thus claims to solve the moral problem by giving an account of moral judgments in terms of what one would desire if one were fully rational. As such, he attempts to maintain a form of moral realism while still accounting for the motivational force of moral judgments.\n\nA partial list of publications by Smith:\n\n\n\n"}

The changes included the return of Great Missenden to Chesham and Amersham, Hazlemere to Wycombe and Aston Clinton to Buckingham. In addition, Marlow was transferred from Wycombe to Beaconsfield and Princes Risborough from Aylesbury to Buckingham. The boundary between the two Milton Keynes constituencies was realigned and they were renamed as Milton Keynes North and Milton Keynes South.\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval.

The station was built by the BBC as the first of a network of regional dual (\"twin wave\" was the term then used) transmitter stations, replacing the city based ones used previously, and this was to cover the Home Counties, London and South East. The first station, on 842Â kHz, (356m) 50Â kW, went into service in on 21 October 1929, the second on 1148Â kHz, (261m) initially 30Â kW, followed on 9 March 1930.\n\nThe original antenna configuration for the station was two T-antennas hung from four 200Â ft (61m) towers, one T-antenna to the north of the station and the other to the south of the station.\n\nShortly after commencement of transmissions, the channels were identified by a name denoting its function. The National channel was carried on 842Â kHz, and a \"Regional\" service on 1148Â kHz.\n\nThe transmitting station itself featured the latest transmitters from the Marconi Company. No public electricity supply was available so large generators were installed and extensive support staff was recruited and trained by the BBC.\n\nIn 1939 a 91.4 m mast was built on the south side of the station, which along with the existing south T-antenna made a directional array pointing towards central London. This antenna configuration would be used after the war for the BBC Light Programme.\n\nDuring the second world war an extension was added to the northern side of the transmitter building and a 140Â kW STC transmitter was installed.\n\nIn the mid-1950s a 152.4 m mast radiator was constructed on a field around half a mile north of station for the BBC Home Service and the original north T-antenna would be become a reserve antenna for that service.\n\nThe station was re-engineered in the late 1970s and an extra T-antenna (mini T) was hung between two 18.3 m poles constructed a few hundred feet north from the original north T-antenna, and new transmission equipment was installed replacing the original Marconi transmitters, the 140Â kW STC transmitter, and other BBC-designed transmission equipment which was installed in the 1960s.\n\nAfter the re-engineering the south T-antenna and the 91.4 m mast transmitted BBC Radio London and Radio 3; the north T-antenna along with the newly installed mini T-antenna was used for Radio 1, and the 152.4 m mast was used for Radio 2.\n\nIn the years since the re-engineering little has changed to the antenna and structure layout of the station, but the services have changed and the station now transmits Absolute Radio instead of Radio 3, Sunrise Radio instead of BBC Radio London, Talksport instead of Radio 1, and BBC Radio 5 Live instead of Radio 2.\n\nMuch development has taken place and the station is now the home to many communications companies who operate various satellite and communication services.\n\nThe station is owned by Arqiva.\n\nLyca Media then started transmitting at 23:00 on 1458Â kHz .The station will be named at a later date.\n\n\n"}

He joined the French Navy, in which he was a reserve officer, a week later. He served on the battleship \"Courbet\", and at the headquarters of the Northern Fleet during the Battle of Dunkirk. He left for London on 19 June 1940 and joined the Forces Navales FranÃ§aises Libres (\"Free French Naval Forces\") on 1 July 1940, the day they were founded.\n\nSpeaking fluent English, he was asked to serve as a translator and cipher officer. Impressed by the techniques of the new British Commandos, formed in 1940, Kieffer requested authorisation to set up an elite French unit on the same model. In May 1941, he obtained authorisation from Admiral Emile Muselier to found the unit of Fusiliers-Marins Commandos (\"Marine Riflemen Commandos\"). They undertook extremely harsh selection and training in Achnacarry, in Scotland, where a number of candidates died. The Commando was part of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando. \nKieffer was promoted to \"lieutenant de vaisseau\" on 1 July 1942. On 19 August 1942, men of the 1st Company of the 1er Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos were engaged during the Dieppe Raid (\"Operation Jubilee\").\n\nIn 1943, the French Commando had grown to two troops, and was regularly used for night raids on the shores of France and the Netherlands during the preparations for the invasion of Normandy. In 1944, the 177 men of the \"1er BFM Commando\" were integrated into the British No. 4 Commando under Lieutenant-Colonel Dawson, part of the 1st Special Service Brigade under Brigadier Lord Lovat.\nSince Luxembourg did not have its own units, some Luxembourgish volunteers were incorporated in the \"1er BFM Commando\" and took part in the landings and battles of Normandy.\n\nOn 6 June 1944, at 0731, the \"BÃ©rets verts\" (\"Green berets\") landed in Ouistreham, Benouville, Amfreville and Bavant, designated as Sword Beach. Kieffer, recently promoted to \"capitaine de corvette\", led his men personally. The unit suffered 21 killed and 93 wounded; Kieffer himself was almost immediately wounded twice, hit by shrapnel in the leg, but refused evacuation for two days. Kieffer rejoined his unit on 14 June, in time to take part in the breakthrough towards the Seine and Honfleur. \n\nAlong with two of his men, he was among the first members of the Free French Forces to enter Paris. His 18-year-old son, who had recently joined the Maquis, was killed by German troops near Paris at nearly the same time.\n\nBy October 1944, the Commando Battalion had three companies. Kieffer led it during the attacks on Vlissingen and Walcheren to capture the port of Antwerp.

It performs a function similar to that of a Major Crime unit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) or large municipal/provincial police agency. The CFNIS was created to address lessons learned through the CF's experiences in Somalia, the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and on other difficult deployed missions. The creation of the CFNIS also fulfilled recommendations made by the Special Advisory Group on Military Justice and Military Police Investigation Services, chaired by the Right Honourable Brian Dickson, P.C., C.C., C.D. and the Report of the Military Police Services Review Group (Belzile Report) that the Military Justice System required an investigative agency that was independent of the military chain of command.\n\nThe CFNIS has maintained a presence in every major CF deployment since 1997. The CFNIS has repeatedly demonstrated the value of their independence, investigative expertise, and ability to function under the most austere conditions. The CFNIS investigated the \"friendly fire\" bombing of CF troops in Afghanistan. Each subsequent fatality in the operational theatre has also been investigated by the CFNIS including the death of two fellow Military Police members during an Improvised Explosive Device attack.\n\nThe CFNIS investigates serious or sensitive service and criminal offences against property, persons, and DND. It has authority and jurisdiction over persons subject to the Code of Service Discipline (CSD), wherever Canadian Forces are established or deployed throughout the world, regardless of rank or status. Civilians deployed with the military can also be subject to the Code of Service Discipline. In addition, like all members of the Canadian Forces Military Police, personnel of the CFNIS have the authority to lay criminal charges in civilian court in cases where civilians break the law on or in relation to military property.\n\nTo contribute to the maintenance of operationally ready, combat-capable forces by providing professional, timely and independent police investigative services to the Department of National Defence, the Canadian Forces and the communities they serve at home and around the world.\n\nAll personnel within the CFNIS are members of the Military Police. The members are specifically selected for these positions and typically have a broad variety of experience both in Canada and with deployed CF Missions around the world. Section 156 of the \"National Defence Act\" and section 2 of the Criminal Code define the powers of military police. Their investigative training is on par with any major police agency in Canada. They receive training at the Canadian Forces Military Police Academy (CFMPA) at CFB Borden, Ontario, through the Canadian Police College in Ottawa, Ontario, and through a variety of partnerships with domestic police agencies and military allies.\nThe members of the CFNIS remain subject to the Military Police Code of Conduct and are subject to oversight by the Military Police Professional Standards organization and the Military Police Complaints Commission, a federal independent, quasi-judicial body, established by the Parliament of Canada.\n\nThe CFNIS Commanding Officer (CO) is a Lieutenant-Colonel, who reports directly to the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal (CFPM). Regardless of the circumstance or environment, the members of the CFNIS remain under command of the CFNIS CO. The independence that results from this command relationship enables the CFNIS to conduct thorough investigations without fear of influence from any military command element.\n\nRequests for CFNIS investigations come through regular military police organizations, but CF members and DND employees can lay complaints, or communicate directly with regional offices or individual CFNIS members. Charges, through either civilian or military courts, can follow investigation and documentation of complaints that fall within the CFNIS mandate. Investigators receive dedicated, independent advice from Regional Military Prosecutors throughout the course of their investigations. The CFNIS works in close cooperation with other military police units and civilian law enforcement agencies. Other countries with an independent military investigative capability include the United States, United Kingdom and France.\n\nThe CFNIS HQ is located in Ottawa, Ontario, and services are provided through six regional offices, a special operations section and a criminal intelligence section.\n\nOn major CF deployments, a detachment of the CFNIS may be established on a temporary basis. Currently, the Joint-Task Force Afghanistan Detachment, based at Kandahar Air Field, has responsibility for the JTF Afghanistan Area of Operations.\n\nWhile the CFNIS Regional Detachments are located on or near Canadian Forces Bases, the CFNIS personnel work independently from the normal military chain of command. They receive direction and report directly to the CO CFNIS.\n\nMembers of the CFNIS are selected from fully trained, experienced Military Police members who have completed various Military Police training and worked for at least one tour of duty as a Military Police in a base or wing before applying to become an investigator with the CFNIS. After selection, they are submitted to specialized training depending on their positions and also have to complete a one-year internship before operating as a full fledged investigator.\n\nThis course is designed to provide new members of the CFNIS with a detailed understanding of the full spectrum of CFNIS operations including all associated internal specialty services. Subjects covered during this course include:\n\nAll new members of the CFNIS undergo the Military Police Investigations Course (MPIC) at the Canadian Forces Military Police Academy (CFMPA). During this course the students are taught specialist skills such as crime scene processing, investigation planning, writing of search warrants and planning and conducting interviews. This training includes an intensive final crime scene processing examination. After completion of this course all CFNIS members undergo a one-year \"internship\" program where they are expected to hone their practical investigative skills under the guidance of an experienced CFNIS member. CFNIS members also attend numerous specialty investigation courses at other training facilities, such as the Canadian Police College, where they undergo instruction on a vast array of subjects such as major case management, drug investigation techniques, forensic interviewing, forensic identification, and sexual assault investigations.\n\nProfessional development for CFNIS members is continuous since they are expected to maintain currency in order to provide the best service possible.\n\nMembers of the CFNIS undergo specialized training depending on their positions, in areas like major case management, sexual assault investigations, major crimes techniques, fraud investigations, sudden death investigations, forensics interviewing, arson basic investigations and computer forensics to name a few.\n\nMembers of the CFNIS sometimes fill seconded positions with other law enforcement agencies across the country. Some examples of secondments include: Halifax Regional Police Integrated Major Crimes Unit, SÃ»retÃ© du QuÃ©bec Major Crimes, Criminal Intelligence Service Canada (Ottawa), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in various divisions.

It is a coarse-grained pink to light red syenogranite with minor gray monzogranite, and it has a distinctive brick-red appearance where it outcrops. The granite gets its name from the Pikes Peak, which is made up almost entirely of this rock. \n\nThe Pikes Peak granite was emplaced in three major intrusive events in the southern Front Range, now exposed in Colorado's Lost Creek Wilderness, Buffalo Peaks Wilderness, and Pikes Peak. It is the geochemically potassic series of plutons compromising most of the Pikes Peak batholith, a batholith formed of two major types of plutons, the potassic Pikes Peak granite and later plutons, plus late stage sodic syenite and granite plutons. Both the batholith and the Pikes Peak granite are A-type, meaning granites that originate in anorogenic, or non mountain building, tectonic settings, with an alkaline geochemistry and arising from more anhydrous magmas.\n\nOver the next billion years, the now cooled granite was gradually exposed through erosion of overlying rocks. About 60 million years ago, parts of the Western U.S. were subjected to a series of uplifts, known as the Laramide orogeny, that eventually formed the modern Rocky Mountains and raised Pikes Peak to its current height. Pikes Peak, like other portions of Colorado Rockies is still being uplifted today as a part of larger tectonic processes affecting the Western United States.\n\nToday, the Pikes Peak Batholith and Granite is exposed over a large part of the central Front Range of Colorado. It is found as far north as the southern slopes of Mount Evans west of Denver, west to South Park, and as far south as CaÃ±on City. The batholith is about 80 miles (130Â km) long in the north-south direction and about 25 miles (40Â km) wide east to west. Even more of it remains hidden underground. Geologists have found the granite at the bottom of deep wells on the plains and magnetic sensors have detected it as much as to the east.\n\nThe granite ranges in color from light pink to almost red. The pink color is due to large amounts of microcline feldspar and various iron minerals that permeate the rock. The long cooling time and the chemical composition of the original magma allowed large crystals to precipitate out of the magma. As a result, in many places the granite is very coarse grained, made up almost entirely of large crystals of feldspar, typically about a centimeter across. This makes the granite easily weathered and very crumbly. Almost every hill and slope in the Pikes Peak region is covered with thick blankets of loose gravel (scree) made up of marble-sized grains of feldspar.\n\nIn some places, the cooling process lasted long enough to form pegmatites that contain large, pure crystals of various minerals. The chemistry of the cooling magma produced a complex and unique mineralogy that attracts collectors from around the world and the Pikes Peak region is famous for its spectacular mineral specimens.\n\nSmoky quartz crystals and topaz are found in many places in the Pikes Peak granite. Probably the most famous mineral from the area is amazonite, a bluish form of microcline feldspar that is relatively rare in other parts of the world. Many museum collections have stunning specimens of deep blue amazonite crystals studded with jet-black smoky quartz crystals.\n\n1.

Trahan used the Johnny Rebel name for a series of recordings for J. D. \"Jay\" Miller's Reb Rebel label in the 1960s in response to the civil rights movement. The 12 songs exhibit racial hatred marketed as \"subtle, rib-tickling satire\". The songs frequently used the racial slur \"\"nigger\"\" and often voiced sympathy for racial segregation, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Confederate States of America.\n\nIn a 2003 interview, Trahan claimed that he \"just did it for the money\" and that he \"didn't set out to spread hate or start trouble\". He said \"At that time, there was a lot of resentment â whites toward blacks and blacks toward whites. So, everybody had their own feelings. Lots of people changed their feelings over the years. I basically changed my feelings over the years up to a point.\"\n\nTrahan was born in Moss Bluff, Louisiana in 1938 to Homer Trahan and Elizabeth Breaux Taylor.\n\nTrahan first recorded songs under the Johnny Rebel name in the mid-1960s at J. D. \"Jay\" Miller's recording studio in Crowley, Louisiana. Miller produced the sessions and issued the recordings on his Reb Rebel label.\n\nTrahan's first releaseâthe fifth for the Reb Rebel labelâwas a 45 RPM single of \"Lookin' for a Handout\" and \"Kajun Ku Klux Klan\". He then recorded more singles for the label: \"Nigger, Nigger\", \"Coon Town\", \"Who Likes a Nigger?\", \"Nigger Hatin' Me\", \"Still Looking for a Handout\", \"Some Niggers Never Die (They Just Smell That Way)\", \"Stay Away from Dixie\", and \"Move Them Niggers North\".\n\nFew of Trahan's songs concern topics other than race. These exceptions include \"Keep a-Workin' Big Jim\", about the efforts of Louisiana district attorney Jim Garrison to solve the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, and \"(Federal Aid Hell!) The Money Belongs to Us\", a song critical of U.S. federal aid programs. Two of these songs were eventually issued in album format by Reb Rebel Records under the title \"For Segregationists Only\".\n\nIn 1974, Trahan's song \"LÃ¢che pas la patate\" (also known as \"The Potato Song\"), sung by Jimmy C. Newman was released in Canada.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Trahan noticed a resurgence in interest in his music. He then recorded and released a new song titled \"Infidel Anthem\", describing the whipping America should lay on Osama bin Laden. His new manager, a fan, booked him on \"The Howard Stern Show\", where he promoted the song. This led to increased interest in his music.\n\nA CD compilation of his works simply shows a hooded member of the Ku Klux Klan together with a depiction of the Confederate Battle Flag. The cover of the album \"It's the Attitude, Stupid!\" shows a hooded Klansman, holding what appears to be either a Walkman or an MP3 player with a confederate flag texture, and wearing headphones.\n\nAccording to Trahan, he only performed a Johnny Rebel song once. Trahan states he was playing country music in the town of Kaplan, when someone in the crowd requested a Rebel song, and obliged after making sure they were no blacks in the audience.\n\nTrahan did have an issue with reparations for slavery, saying \"Blacks develop an attitude towards the whites, and they won't let it go. They won't let go of what happened. Why should we pay reparations for things that happened 200 years ago? I was run out of my country ... my ancestors were run out of Nova Scotia.\"\n\nTrahan died on September 3, 2016.\n\nJohnny Rebel is often misidentified as the pseudonym of David Allan Coe, an American outlaw country singer who achieved popularity during the 1970s and 1980s. The confusion stems in part from the song \"Nigger Fucker\", which appears on Coe's \"Underground Album\". Coe has been quoted as saying that \"anyone that hears \"[Underground Album]\" and says I'm a racist is full of shit.\"\n\nSome of Johnny Rebel's songs have also been misattributed to Johnny Horton, an American country music and rockabilly singer who died in 1960. The confusion appears to stem from a song by Horton called \"Johnny Reb\".\n\nJohnny Rebel's songs have been covered by other singers such as Big Reb and the German neo-Nazi band Landser, which covered Rebel's \"Coon Town\" as \"Kreuzberg\", the 9th song on its 1997 album, \"Deutsche Wut/Rock gegen Oben\".\n\nIn 2003, the website of Resistance Records, a white supremacist label, listed Johnny Rebel's \"Klassic Klan Kompositions\" as its no. 2 seller, second only to the video game \"Ethnic Cleansing\".\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League reported that \"Since the 1960s, when racist country singer Johnny Rebel recorded songs such as \"N-- Hatin' Me,\" more than 500 hate rock bands have formed worldwide\".\n\nThe television series \"The Boondocks\" parodied Johnny Rebel's music in one of its episodes (entitled \"The Story of Jimmy Rebel\"). The episode portrays a recording artist who is ostensibly Johnny Rebel.\n\nIn 2005, the Johnny Rebel song \"Some Niggers Never Die (They Just Smell That Way)\" was used in the film \"What Is It?\", directed by Crispin Glover.\n"}

The company operates in Canada and Asia as \"Manulife\" and in the United States primarily through its John Hancock Financial division. As of December 2015, the company employed approximately 34,000 people and had 63,000 agents under contract, and has 935 billion in assets under management and administration. Manulife services over 26 million customers worldwide.\n\nManulife is the largest insurance company in Canada and the 28th largest fund manager in the world based on worldwide institutional assets under management (AUM).\n\nManulife Bank of Canada is a wholly owned subsidiary of Manulife.\n\nManulife was incorporated as \"The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company\" by Act of Parliament on 23 June 1887 and was headed by Canada's prime minister, John A. Macdonald, and Ontario's lieutenant-governor, Alexander Campbell (there were no conflict-of-interest guidelines at the time and it was not unusual for public persons to be involved in private industry). The idea for the company came from J. B. Carlile, who came to Canada as an agent for the North American Life Assurance Company. It was his first-hand experience on which the new company's product portfolio was based.\nThe firm was founded as The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company in 1887. Its first president was John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The company sold its first policy outside of Canada in Bermuda in 1893. In 1894, policies were sold in Grenada, Jamaica and Barbados; Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti in 1895; and British Honduras, British Guiana, China and British Hong Kong in 1897.\n\nIn 1901, Manulife amalgamated with the Temperance and General Life Assurance Company, a Toronto-based Canadian life insurer that provided preferred rates to abstainers of alcohol. Manulife continued to offer abstainers rates into the 1920s.\n\nIn 1931, it opened its first southern China branch in British Hong Kong. Shortly thereafter, it established itself as a leading life insurer in the region with branches in Macau, Shantou and Amoy.\n\nIn 1958, shareholders voted to change its legal form from a joint stock company to a mutual organization, making the company privately owned by its policyholders.\n\nIn 1984, Manulife announced that it had acquired Waterloo, Ontario-based Dominion Life Assurance Company, a deal that included the purchase of all of the outstanding stock of the company from Lincoln National. Dominion Life was founded in Waterloo in 1889, and Manulife made a commitment to the community to retain a significant presence in Waterloo. In 1988, Manulife opened a new five-storey office building at 500 King Street North in Waterloo to house its Canadian Division.\n\nIn 1996, the company entered an agreement with Sinochem to form Shanghai-based Zhong Hong Life Insurance Co. Ltd., China's first joint venture life insurance company, and was granted a license that made it the second foreign insurer to be allowed re-entry into China.\n\nIn 1999, its voting eligible policyholders approved demutualization, and the shares of Manulife, the holding company of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) under the ticker \"MFC\", and on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) under the ticker \"945\".\n\nIn 2002, ManulifeâSinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd. was granted approval by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to open a branch office in Guangzhou, China, the first branch license granted to a foreign invested jointâventure life insurance company. In 2003, Manulife-Sinochem received approval for a branch office in Beijing, the first multiple-branch license granted to a foreign-invested joint venture life insurance company. The firm is now licensed to operate in more than 50 Chinese cities.\n\nOn September 29, 2003, Manulife announced its intent to acquire the Boston-based insurance company John Hancock Financial (including a Canadian subsidiary, Maritime Life) for $10.4 billion in a stock-for-stock merger. The merged entity would initially be led by John Hancock's CEO David F. D'Alessandro, but he would step down in June 2004.\n\nIn September 2009, the company purchased AIC's Canadian retail investment fund business. In October 2009, it purchased Pottruff & Smith Travel Insurance Brokers Inc., a Canadian broker and third party administrator of travel insurance.\n\nIn 2010, the company announced that it had purchased Fortis Bank SA/NV's 49% ownership in ABN AMRO TEDA Fund Management Co. Ltd. The new joint venture, Manulife TEDA Fund Management Company Ltd. (Manulife TEDA), provides traditional retail and institutional asset management for clients in China. The other 51 per cent is owned by Northern International Trust, part of Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding Co., Ltd. (TEDA).\n\nIn June 2012, the company opened Manulife Cambodia, with headquarters in Phnom Penh.\n\nIn 2013 Richard DeWolfe became the chair of the company's board, succeeding Gail Cook-Bennett, who retired after serving 34 years on the board. In 2009, Donald Guloien, the chief investment officer, succeeded Dominic D'Alessandro as president and CEO of the company. Shortly before his departure, D'Alessandro modified his retirement package; the restricted units would only vest for a total of $10 million if the shares reached $36 by the end of 2011, and he would receive $5 million if the shares hit $30. This was in response to shareholders' reaction to the first quarterly loss ever posted by the firm in its public history. Under Guloien's leadership, the first initiatives were a dividend cut and an equity offering to bolster Manulife's capital levels, making it difficult for the share price to reach the target levels needed to vest.\n\nIn September 2014, Manulife agreed to acquire the Canadian operations of Standard Life for a fee of around US$3.7 billion.\n\nIn 2014, Manulife Financial simplified its logo and brand to refer to itself only as Manulife outside of the United States.\n\nIn April 2015, the company announced a partnership with DBS Bank, providing Manulife exclusive access to DBS customers in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia in exchange for an initial payment of US$1.2 billion.\n\nIn June 2015, Manulife-Sinochem became the first foreign invested joint-venture life insurance company in China authorized to sell mutual funds.\n\nIn May 2016, Manulife US real estate investment trust became a public company via an initial public offering on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nIn April 2016, Manulife became the first Canadian insurance company to offer life insurance to people who are HIV-positive, insuring people who have tested HIV-positive, who are between the ages of 30 and 65, and meet certain other criteria for life insurance policies that would pay up to $2 million upon death.\n\n"}

It was established in 1955 and initially used a small lattice tower. The present tower is high and was built in 1962.\n\nIt was originally used to broadcast the London ITV signal on VHF Band III. When UHF broadcasting began, the nearby Crystal Palace transmitting station was used. VHF television was discontinued in 1985, and the Croydon transmitter was not used for regular TV broadcasting until 1997, when a new directional UHF antenna, designed to avoid interference with continental transmitters, was installed to carry the newly launched Channel 5 in the London area. It carried Channel 5's analogue signal, and the digital terrestrial signal is transmitted from Crystal Palace. Croydon also had reserve transmitters for BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4, but these were used only in the event of engineering works or a failure at Crystal Palace. Since the digital switchover in April 2012 no television has been broadcast from Croydon, but it is still used as a backup for Crystal Palace for the BBC A & B, Digital 3&4 and COM 4, 5 and 6 multiplexes.\n\nThe site is also a maintenance base for transmitter maintenance teams and used to house one of four Regional Operations Centres.\n\nâ  Backup for Crystal Palace.\n\nThe past ITV franchises which originally served London were Associated-Rediffusion (weekdays) and Associated Television (weekends) began transmitting on VHF 9 on 22 September 1955, and were the first ITV services.

Thames Television and London Weekend Television took over the London franchise area in 1968. The VHF analogue service closed down, along with the rest of the UK, on 3 January 1985.\n\nChannel 5 launched on 30 March 1997 with transmissions from Croydon and many other former VHF sites in the UK.

The name has also been used for solitaire card games and for legitimate educational children's games that are based on the fundamental principle of picking up scattered cards or objects.\n\nThe game requires at least one player who is familiar with the game (the prankster) and one player who wants to be initiated into the game. The prankster presents a deck of cards, and \"unnecessary\" cards such as jokers may be removed to give the impression that a legitimate game will be played. The prankster, as \"dealer\", then throws the entire deck into the air so the cards land strewn on the floor. The other player must then pick them up.\n\nOther card games sometimes transpose into 52 pickup. For an example, a child falling behind in go fish or crazy eights, or bored by a never-ending game of war, can simply declare \"52-card pickup!\" and sweep all the cards off the table.\n\nOne variant has the \"dealer\" hold up the deck of cards in one hand in a grip similar to the grip one might use to shuffle the cards. The deck is usually pre-arranged to have a few black cards on the bottom. The \"dealer\" instructs the other player(s) to call out \"smoke\" if they see a black card, and \"fire\" if they see a red. They hold up the deck and take the cards one by one off the bottom as the other player(s) call out \"smoke\" ... \"smoke\" ... \"smoke\" ... and, with the first red card, \"fire!\" On hearing \"fire\", the \"dealer\" riffles the cards (as if to shuffle them) into the air, \"firing\" the entire deck of cards toward the other player(s).\n\nThe prank is sometimes renamed to adjust for deck sizes other than 52 or to fool someone who is already familiar with the game under its normal name.\n\nAnother version of the prank can be played where one player declares \"52-card pick up\" and is then granted power to throw each of the 52 cards individually at any of the opponents.\n\nBy introducing additional rules, the task of picking up the cards can be made into a solitaire game. A popular rule of this kind is that only cards from the top of the heap may be removed, and that they must be removed in sets that form poker combinations.\n\nSimilarly, a competitive element can be introduced, e.g. when one player must pick up the cards in red suits and another those in black suits. If the cards are substituted with more robust and easily distinguishable objects such as plastic spoons in various colors, the game becomes appropriate for a group of very young children to train locomotive, object control, and recognition skills. Letter or word cards can be used for older children.\n\nA similar game is called \"card rugby\" (a cross between 52 pickup and rugby) which involves two teams of people. The dealer has a pack of cards, they then show the teams a card in the pack, e.g. two of spades. The dealer then shuffles the cards and they are thrown into the air. The two teams then must find the card mentioned and the first team to find the card and run to the other end of the room with it and touch down wins.\n\nWhile written records start later, the prank appears to have been played among children as early as the middle of the 20th century. The \"Encyclopedia of American Folklore\" discusses it under \"folk humor\" and, confirmed by numerous references in popular cultures, describes it as a \"popular American prank\". It notes that the typical mark for the prank is a very young child who is too keen to be included in play to ask questions. The game is also popular in Germany, where it is known as \"32 heb auf\" and is played with 32 cards. At least one American card game anthology has listed the prank among more formal children's games.\n"}
{"id": "1928374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928374", "title": "Perfection", "text": "Perfection\n\nPerfection is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. \n\nThe term is used to designate a range of diverse, if often kindred, concepts. These have historically been addressed in a number of discrete disciplines, notably mathematics, physics, chemistry, ethics, aesthetics, ontology, and theology.\n\nThe form of the word long fluctuated in various languages. The English language had the alternates, \"perfection\" and the Biblical \"perfectness.\" The word \"perfection\" derives from the Latin \"\"perfectio\"\", and \"perfect\" â from \"\"perfectus\"\". These expressions in turn come from \"\"perficio\"\" â \"to finish\", \"to bring to an end.\" \"\"Perfectio\"(n)\" thus literally means \"a finishing\", and \"perfect\"(us)\"\" â \"finished\", much as in grammatical parlance (\"perfect\").\n\nMany modern languages have adopted their terms for the concept of \"perfection\" from the Latin: the French \"\"parfait\"\" and \"\"perfection\"\"; the Italian \"\"perfetto\"\" and \"\"perfezione\"\"; the Spanish \"\"perfecto\"\" and \"\"perfecciÃ³n\"\"; the English \"perfect\" and \"perfection\"; the Russian \"\"ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÑÑÐµÐ½Ð½ÑÐ¹\"\" (sovyershenniy) and \"\"ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÑÑÐµÐ½cÑÐ²Ð¾\"\" (sovyershenstvo); the Croatian and Serbian \"\"savrÅ¡en\"\" and \"\"savrÅ¡enstvo\"\"; the Czech \"\"dokonalost\"\"; the Slovak \"\"dokonaly\"\" and \"\"dokonalost\"\"; the Polish \"\"doskonaÅy\"\" and \"\"doskonaÅoÅÄ\".\"\n\nThe genealogy of the concept of \"perfection\" reaches back beyond Latin, to Greek. The Greek equivalent of the Latin \"\"perfectus\"\" was \"\"teleos\".\" The latter Greek expression generally had concrete referents, such as a perfect physician or flutist, a perfect comedy or a perfect social system. Hence the Greek \"\"teleiotes\"\" was not yet so fraught with abstract and superlative associations as would be the Latin \"\"perfectio\"\" or the modern \"perfection.\" To avoid the latter associations, the Greek term has generally been translated as \"completeness\" rather than \"perfection.\"\n\nThe oldest definition of \"perfection\", fairly precise and distinguishing the shades of the concept, goes back to Aristotle. In Book \"Delta\" of the \"Metaphysics\", he distinguishes three meanings of the term, or rather three shades of one meaning, but in any case three different concepts. That is perfect:\n\nThe first of these concepts is fairly well subsumed within the second. Between those two and the third, however, there arises a duality in concept. This duality was expressed by Thomas Aquinas, in the \"Summa Theologica\", when he distinguished a twofold perfection: when a thing is perfect in itself â as he put it, in its \"substance\"; and when it perfectly serves its \"purpose\".\n\nThe variants on the concept of perfection would have been quite of a piece for two thousand years, had they not been confused with other, kindred concepts. The chief of these was the concept of that which is the best: in Latin, \"\"excellentia\"\" (\"excellence\"). In antiquity, \"\"excellentia\"\" and \"\"perfectio\"\" made a pair; thus, for example, dignitaries were called \"\"perfectissime\"\", just as they are now called \"excellency.\" Nevertheless, these two expression of high regard differ fundamentally: \"\"excellentia\"\" is a distinction among many, and implies comparison; while \"\"perfectio\"\" involves no comparison, and if something is deemed perfect, then it is deemed so in itself, without comparison to other things. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who thought much about perfection and held the world to be the best of possible worlds, did not claim that it was perfect.\n\nThe parallel existence of two concepts of perfection, one strict (\"perfection,\" as such) and the other loose (\"excellence\"), has given rise, perhaps since antiquity but certainly since the Renaissance, to a singular paradox: that the greatest perfection is imperfection. This was formulated by Lucilio Vanini (1585â1619), who had a precursor in the 16th-century writer Joseph Juste Scaliger, and they in turn referred to the ancient philosopher Empedocles. Their argument, as given by the first two, was that if the world were perfect, it could not improve and so would lack \"true perfection,\" which depends on progress. To Aristotle, \"perfect\" meant \"complete\" (\"nothing to add or subtract\"). To Empedocles, according to Vanini, perfection depends on incompleteness (\"\"perfectio propter imperfectionem\"\"), since the latter possesses a potential for development and for complementing with new characteristics (\"\"perfectio complementii\"\"). This view relates to the baroque esthetic of Vanini and Marin Mersenne: the perfection of an art work consists in its forcing the recipient to be activeâto complement the art work by an effort of mind and imagination.\n\nThe paradox of perfectionâthat imperfection is perfectâapplies not only to human affairs, but to technology. Thus, irregularity in semiconductor crystals (an imperfection, in the form of contaminants) is requisite for the production of semiconductors. The solution to the apparent paradox lies in a distinction between two concepts of \"perfection\": that of regularity, and that of utility. Imperfection is perfect in technology, in the sense that irregularity is useful.\n\nPerfect numbers have been distinguished ever since the ancient Greeks called them \"\"teleioi\".\" There was, however, no consensus among the Greeks as to which numbers were \"perfect\" or why. A view that was shared by Plato held that 10 was a perfect number. Mathematicians, including the mathematician-philosopher Pythagoreans, proposed as a perfect number, the number 6.\n\nThe number 10 was thought perfect because there are 10 fingers to the two hands. The number 6 was believed perfect for being divisible in a special way: a sixth part of that number constitutes unity; a third is two; a half â three; two-thirds () is four; five-sixths (\"pentamoiron\") is five; six is the perfect whole. The ancients also considered 6 a perfect number because the human foot constituted one-sixth the height of a man, hence the number 6 determined the height of the human body.\nThus both numbers, 6 and 10, were credited with perfection, both on purely mathematical grounds and on grounds of their relevance in nature. Belief in the \"perfection\" of certain numbers survived antiquity, but this quality came to be ascribed to other numbers as well. The perfection of the number 3 actually became proverbial: \"\"omne trinum perfectum\"\" (). Another number, 7, found a devotee in the 6th-century Pope Gregory I (Gregory the Great), who favored it on grounds similar to those of the Greek mathematicians who had seen 6 as a perfect number, and in addition for some reason he associated the number 7 with the concept of \"eternity.\"\n\nThe Middle Ages, however, championed the perfection of 6: Augustine and Alcuin wrote that God had created the world in 6 days because that was the perfect number.\n\nThe Greek mathematicians had regarded as perfect that number which equals the sum of its divisors that are smaller than itself. Such a number is neither 3 nor 7 nor 10, but 6, for 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\nBut there are more numbers that show this property, such as 28, which = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. It became customary to call such numbers \"perfect.\" Euclid gave a formula for (even) \"perfect\" numbers:\nwhere \"p\" and 2Â âÂ 1 are prime numbers.\n\nEuclid had listed the first four perfect numbers: 6; 28; 496; and 8128. A manuscript of 1456 gave the fifth perfect number: 33,550,336. Gradually mathematicians found further perfect numbers (which are very rare). In 1652 the Polish polymath Jan BroÅ¼ek noted that there was no perfect number between 10 and 10.\n\nDespite over 2,000 years of study, it still is not known whether there exist infinitely many perfect numbers; or whether there are any odd ones.\n\nToday the term \"perfect number\" is merely historic in nature, used for the sake of tradition. These peculiar numbers had received the name on account of their analogy to the construction of man, who was held to be nature's most perfect creation, and above all on account of their own peculiar regularity. Thus, they had been so named on the same grounds as perfect objects in nature, and perfectly proportioned edifices and statues created by man; the numbers had come to be called \"perfect\" in order to emphasize their special regularity.\n\nThe Greek mathematicians had named these numbers \"perfect\" in the same sense in which philosophers and artists used the word. Jamblich (\"In Nicomachi arithmeticam\", Leipzig, 1894) states that the Pythagoreans had called the number 6 \"marriage,\" \"health,\" and \"beauty,\" on account of the harmony and accord of that number.\n\nThe perfect numbers early on came to be treated as the measure of other numbers: those in which the sum of the divisors is greater than the number itself, as in 12, have â since as early as Theon of Smyrna, ca. 130 A.D. â been called \"redundant\" (), \"more than perfect\" (\"plus quam perfecti\"), or \"abundant numbers\", and those the sum of whose divisors is smaller, as in 8, have been called \"deficient numbers\" (\"deficientes\").\n\nAs of 7 December 2018, 51 perfect numbers had been identified.\n\nA variety of physical and chemical concepts include, in their names, the word \"perfect.\"\n\nThe physicist designates as a \"perfectly rigid\" body, one that \"is not deformed by forces applied to it.\" He uses the concept in the full awareness that this is a fictitious body, that no such body exists in nature. The concept is an \"ideal construct\".\n\nA \"perfectly plastic\" body is one that is deformed infinitely at a constant load corresponding to the body's limit of plasticity: this is a physical \"model\", not a body observed in nature.\n\nA \"perfectly black\" body would be one that absorbed completely, radiation falling upon it â that is, a body with a coefficient of absorption equal to unity.\n\nA crystal is perfect when its physically equivalent walls are equally developed; it has a perfect structure when it answers the requirements of spatial symmetry and is free of structural defects, dislocation, lacunae and other flaws.\n\nA \"perfect fluid\" is one that is incompressible and non-viscous â this, again, is an ideal fluid that does not exist in nature.\n\nA \"perfect gas\" is one whose molecules do not interact with each other and which have no volume of their own. Such a gas is \"fictitious\", just as are perfectly solid, perfectly rigid, perfectly plastic and perfectly black bodies. They are termed \"perfect\" in the \"strict\" (non-metaphorical) sense of the word. These are all concepts that are necessary in physics, insofar as they are limiting, ideal, fictitious â insofar as they set the extreme which nature may at the most approach.\n\nIn a \"looser\" sense, real things are called \"perfect\" if they approximate perfection more or less closely, though they be not, strictly speaking, perfect.\n\nThe relation of these \"perfect\" bodies to \"real\" bodies may be illustrated by the relation of a perfect gas to a real one. The equation of state of a perfect gas is a first approximation to a quantum equation of state that results from statistical physics. Thus, the equation of state of a real gas within classical limits assumes the form of the equation of state of a perfect gas. That is, the equation of state of a perfect gas describes an ideal gas (comprising points, that is, dimensionless molecules that do not act upon one another).\n\nThe perfect gas equation arose from the work of Robert Boyle, Edme Mariotte and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who, in studying the properties of real gases, found formulas applicable not to these but to an ideal, perfect gas.\n\nThe \"ethical\" question of perfection concerns not whether man \"is\" perfect, but whether he \"should\" be. And if he \"should\" be, then how is this to be attained?\n\nPlato seldom actually used the term, \"perfection\"; but the concept of \"good\", central to his philosophy, was tantamount to \"perfection.\" He believed that approximation to the idea of perfection makes people perfect.\n\nSoon after, the Stoics introduced the concept of perfection into ethics expressly, describing it as harmony â with nature, reason, man himself. They held that such harmonyâsuch perfectionâwas attainable for anyone.\n\nPlato and the Stoics had made perfection a philosophical watchword. Soon it would be transformed, in Christianity, into a religious one.\n\nThe Christian doctrine of perfection is in the Gospels as well as elsewhere in the Bible. Matthew 5:48 enjoins: \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" Early Christian writings, especially Paul's, are replete with calls to perfection. Many of these are collected in a discourse by St. Augustine, \"De perfectione iustitiae hominis\". They begin already with the Old Testament: \"Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.\" (\"Deuteronomy\" 18:13.) Elsewhere synonyms for \"perfection\" are \"undefiled\", \"without rebuke\", \"without blemish\", \"blameless\", \"holy\", \"righteous\", \"unblamable\", \"unreprovable.\"\nAugustine explains that not only that man is properly termed perfect and without blemish who is already perfect, but also he who \"strives\" unreservedly after perfection. This is a broader concept, of \"approximate\" perfection, resembling that used in the exact sciences. The first ancient and Christian perfection was not very remote from modern \"self-perfection\". St. Ambrose in fact wrote about \"degrees\" of perfection (\"\"gradus piae perfectionis\"\").\n\nAlong with the idea of perfection, Holy Scripture conveyed doubt as to whether perfection was \"attainable\" for man. According to 1 John 1:8, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" Similarly Jesus said in Matthew 19:17: \"And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God...\"; while Jesus does not deny that he himself is good, he does call into question the idea that anyone but God can even be good, let alone perfect. And St. Jerome wrote: \"\"Perfectio vera in coelestibus\"\" â true perfection is to be found only in heaven.\n\nAs early as the 5th century CE, two distinct views on perfection had arisen within the Church: that it was attainable by man on earth by his own powers; and, that it may come to pass only by special divine grace. The first view, which was championed by Pelagius, was condemned in 417 CE; the second view, which was championed by St. Augustine, prevailed at the very beginning of the 5th century and became authoritative.\n\nStill, the Church did not condemn the writings of the Pseudo-Areopagite, purportedly the first bishop of Athens, voicing a \"natural\" possibility for man to rise to perfection, to the contemplation of God. And so, for centuries, two views contended within the Church.\n\nEven as, for the ancient philosophers, the essence of perfection had been harmony, so for the Gospel and the Christian theologians it was charity, or love. St. Paul wrote (\"Epistle to the Colossians\", 3:14): \"And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.\"\n\nSt. Gregory wrote that perfection will be realized only after the fulfillment of history â only \"then will the world be beautiful and perfect.\" Still, everyone should make his own approach to perfection â to holiness. Discourses in moral theology and asceticism were generous with advice on how this was to be done.\n\nThe medieval concept of perfection and self-perfection, especially in its mature form, can be natural for modern man. As formulated by Peter Lombard, this concept implies that perfection is a result of \"development\". And as described by Giles of Rome, perfection has not only personal sources (\"\"personalia\"\") but \"social\" ones (\"\"secundum statum\"\"). Since the individual is formed within a society, the second perfection subsumes the first, in accordance with the \"order of the universe\" (\"\"ordo universi\"\"). The social perfection is \"binding\" on man, whereas personal perfection is only \"becoming\" to him.\n\nTheses on perfection persist within the Church to the present day. The first condition for perfection is the desire of it. Also necessary is grace â but God gives grace to those who desire perfection and strive for it. Another condition for perfection is constancy of striving and effort. Augustine says: \"He who stops, regresses.\" And effort is necessary in things not only great but also in the smallest; the Gospel according to St. Luke says: \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\" An aid in approaching perfection is an awareness of God's perfection and of one's own imperfection.\nThe 14th century saw, with the Scotists, a shift in interest from moral to ontological perfection; the 15th century, particularly during the Italian Renaissance, a shift to artistic perfection.\n\nThe first half of the 16th century saw John Calvin's complete conditioning of man's perfection on the grace of God.\n\nThe second half of the 16th century brought the Counter-reformation, the Council of Trent, and a return of the Catholic concept; and also, heroic attempts to attain perfection through contemplation and mortification. This was the age of Ignatius Loyola and the founding of the Jesuit Order; of St. Teresa of Ãvila (1515â82) and St. John of the Cross (1542â91), and the 1593 founding of the Barefoot Carmelites. This was the culminating point in the history of the Christian idea of perfection; at the same time, it was the terminal point as there soon began attempts at reforming the idea.\n\nThe first half of the 17th century saw attempts at a Catholic reform of the idea of perfection. This was the time of Cornelis Jansen (1585â1638) and of Jansenism â of a growing belief in predestination and in the impossibility of perfection without grace.\n\nWith the second half of the 17th century came a further development in the doctrine of predestination â the doctrine of \"Quietism.\" Perfection could be reached through a passive awaiting of grace rather than by an active striving. This theory, formulated in Spain by Miguel de Molinos (ca. 1628 - 1697), spread in France, where it was espoused by Madame Guyon (1648â1717) and for a time attracted FranÃ§ois FÃ©nelon.\n\nThe 18th century brought a sea change to the idea of moral perfection. Faith in it remained, but it changed character from religious to secular. This secular, 18th-century perfection was a fundamental article of faith for the Enlightenment. Its central tenet was that \"nature was perfect\"; and perfect, too, was the man who lived in harmony with nature's law.\n\nPrimitive man was held to be the most perfect, for he was closest to nature. Perfection lay behind present-day man rather than before him, for civilization distanced man from perfection instead of bringing him closer to it.\n\nA second interpretation, however, took the contrary view: civilization perfected man by bringing him closer to reason, and thereby to nature; for reason would direct life with due consideration for the laws of nature.\n\nThe former, retrospective view of perfection had antecedents in antiquity: Hesiod and Ovid had described a \"golden age\" that had existed at the beginning of time, and which had been succeeded by silver, copper and Iron Ages, each inferior to the previous. The renewal of this view now, after two millennia, was stimulated by European contact with the \"primitive\" peoples of the Americas. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was but one of many who wrote in a similar vein.\n\nThese two mid-18th-century schools of thought â one seeing perfection in nature and in the past, and the other in civilization and in the future â represented a reaction not against the idea of perfection, but against its transcendental interpretation: as, earlier, the measure of perfection had been the idea of God, so now it was the idea of nature or of civilization. It was the latter idea that ultimately gained the upper hand and passed into the 19th century as the legacy of the Enlightenment.\n\nThe idea of perfection as transcendental, fell away; only worldly perfection counted. The idea that perfection was a matter of grace, also fell by the wayside; man himself must strive for it, and if a single man could not accomplish it, then perhaps mankind could. As God had been the measure of perfection during the Middle Ages, so now man was: the measure had become smaller, more accessible. To the thinking of the 19th century, such worldly, human perfection might ultimately be attainable by everyone. And if not perfection, then \"improvement\". This would be the great concept of the modern age.\n\nAt the very midpoint of the 18th century, there occurred an exceptional momentary retreat from the idea of perfection. It was in the French \"EncyclopÃ©die\". The entry, \"Perfection\" (vol. XII, 1765), discussed only technical perfection, in the sense of the matching of human products to the tasks set for them; no mention was made of ontological, moral or esthetic perfection.\n\nOtherwise, the 18th century saw great declarations championing the future perfection of man, as in Immanuel Kant's \"Idee zu einer allgemeinem Geschichte\" (1784) and Johann Gottfried von Herder's \"Ideen\" (1784/91).\n\nPerfection was expected to come about by a variety of means. Partly it would be by way of \"natural\" development and progress (the view espoused by David Hume) but more so by way of \"education\" (precursors of this view included John Locke, David Hartley, and the leaders of the Polish Enlightenment) and by way of overt \"state\" action (Claude Adrien HelvÃ©tius, later Jeremy Bentham); reliance was placed in cooperation among people (Charles Fourier, 1808), later in eugenics (Francis Galton, 1869). While the foundations of the faith in the future perfectibility of man changed, the faith itself persisted. It linked the people of the Enlightenment with the idealists and romantics â with Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the Polish Messianists â as well as with the 19th-century Positivists and evolutionists; Herbert Spencer penned a great new declaration championing the future perfection of man.\n\nThe idea of human perfectibility had, however, become more comprehensive. Man would attain greater perfection, in the sense that he would live more rationally, healthily, happily, comfortably. But there was no adequate term for this new conception, as the term \"perfection\" had a moral coloring, while the new goal was more intellectual, physical and social.\n\nIn 1852, John Henry Newman, the future British cardinal, wrote that it would be well if the English language, like the Greek, had a term to express intellectual perfection, analogously to the term \"health\", which addresses man's physical state, and to \"virtue\", which speaks to his moral nature. During the 19th century, the Germans would come to call perfection, thus construed, \"culture\" (\"Kultur\"), and the French would call it \"civilization\" (\"civilisation\").\n\nOne of the elements of perfection, in its new construction, is \"health\", understood by the World Health Organization as \"a state of complete physical and mental well-being.\"\n\nStill, the burgeoning achievements of contemporary biology have not dislodged the age-old interest in moral perfection â with the important distinction, that the goal now is not so much perfection as \"improvement\". A classic early-19th century exponent of this view was Fichte.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the advances of science and technology appear to have been paralleled to some extent by increasingly pluralistic attitudes. The Polish philosopher WÅadysÅaw Tatarkiewicz (1886â1980) has written: \"To demand of someone that he strive after perfection seems equally inappropriate as to blame him for not striving after it.\" Such striving, he adds, \"is often egocentric and yields poorer moral and social results than an outward-directed behavior based not on self-perfection but on good will and kindliness toward others.\"\n\nThe ancient Greeks viewed perfection as a requisite for beauty and high art. The Pythagoreans held that perfection was to be found in the right proportions and in a harmonious arrangement of parts. The idea that beauty and art were characterized by perfection, was subsequently embraced by Plato, who believed that art ought to be \"apt, suitable, without deviations\" â in short, \"perfect\".\n\nFrom a conviction that perfection was a single quality, the Pythagoreans, Plato and their adherents held that beauty also was a single quality; hence, for every kind of art, there was but one perfect and proper form. Plutarch stated (\"De Musica\") that, during the early Greek age, musical harmonies that were recognized as perfect were \"legally binding\" at public performances.\n\nSimilarly, in temple architecture from the 5th century BCE, there were established orders. There were established proportions for Doric temples, and for Ionic temples. Likewise in sculpture, for centuries, it was a matter of dogma that certain proportions of the human body were perfect and obligatory.\n\nThere was also a prevalent belief that certain shapes and proportions were in themselves perfect. Plato felt that the perfect proportion was the ratio of the side to the diagonal of a square. His authority was so great that architects and other artists continued using this proportion, even when ignorant of its source, as late as the Middle Ages.\nAnother early idea â one that was to be espoused by many illustrious writers and artists of various periods â found perfection in the circle and the sphere. Aristotle wrote in the \"Physica\" that the circle was \"the perfect, first, most beautiful form.\" Cicero wrote in \"De Natura Deorum\" (On the Nature of the Gods): \"Two forms are the most distinctive: of solids, the sphere... and of plane figures, the circle... There is nothing more commensurate than these forms.\"\n\nIn a commentary to Aristotle's \"De coelo et mundo\" (\"On the Heavens and Earth\"), the medieval Pole, Jan of SÅupcza, wrote: \"The most perfect body ought to have the most perfect form, and such [a body] is heaven, while the most perfect form is the round form, for nothing can be added to it.\" In the famous illustrated \"Les trÃ¨s riches heures du duc de Berry\", paradise is depicted as contained within an ideal sphere.\n\nThe Renaissance architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475â1554) stated: \"the round form is the most perfect of all.\"\n\nThe most excellent of 16th-century architects, Andrea Palladio, held that \"the most perfect and most excellent\" form was \"the round form, since of all forms it is the simplest, the most uniform, the strongest, the most capacious\" and \"is the most suitable for rendering the unity, infinity, uniformity and righteousness of God.\" This was the same thought as in Jan of SÅupcza and in Serlio, and it was one of uncommon durability.\n\nThe Middle Ages â Romanesque and Gothic alike â had been quite taken with the idea of perfection. But a true explosion of the imperative for perfection came with the Renaissance.\n\nRenaissance aesthetics placed less emphasis than had classical aesthetics on the unity of things perfect. Baldassare Castiglione, in his \"Courtier\", wrote, of Leonardo, Andrea Mantegna, Raphael, Michelangelo and Giorgione, that \"each of them is unlike the others, but each is the most perfect [\"perfectissimus\"] in his style.\" \nThe great architect and polymath Leone Battista Alberti wrote (\"De architectura\") that \"the art of building... in Italy [had] achieved perfect maturity\", that the Romans had \"created such a perfect art of building that there was in it nothing mysterious, hidden or unclear.\" This was yet another formulation of the concept of perfection.\n\nDaniele Barbaro, in his 1567 translation of Vitruvius, classically defined perfection as \"that which lacks nothing and to which nothing can be added.\"\n\nThe Renaissance showed a marked concern with \"preeminence\" in perfection. Leonardo concluded that the most perfect of the arts was painting. In 1546 Benedetto Varchi compared great masters in the arts. Others compared art and science, art and nature, and perfection in the arts of the ancients with that in the modern masters. The 16th century saw comparisons of their music, the 17th â of their visual arts and especially of their poetry. These comparisons construed perfection fairly loosely; the concept was treated more strictly by architects.\n\nThe Renaissance distinguished a variety of properties to perfection. It was variously held to be:\n\nIn the eclectic view of the late Renaissance, perfection in a work would require uniting the talents of \"many\" artists. Paolo Pino held that only that painter would be perfect who combined the talents of Titian and Michelangelo.\n\nThe concept of perfection was harder to apply to Renaissance literature but became so common â often, linked to \"\"eccelente\"\" â as to become banal. Its frequent application brought about its relativization and even subjectivization.\n\nBeginning with Serlio and Palladio, perfection in art had become less important, less definite, less objective. The striving for perfection no longer had the importance for men of letters that it did for the great architects. But the 17th century still revered perfection, as shown by the appearance of that word in book titles: \"De perfecta poesi\" by the Polish poet Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski (1595â1640); \"Le peintre parfait\" (1767 by AndrÃ© FÃ©libien; and \"IdÃ©e de la perfection de la peinture\" (1662) by FrÃ©art de Chambray.\n\nSarbiewski offered several theses: poetry not only imitates things \"perfectissime\" (\"most perfectly\"), but imitates them as they ought \"perfectissime\" to be in nature; perfect art is recognized by its agreement with nature, as well as its universality; art is the more perfect, the nobler (\"nobilior\") its manner of representing things; it is the more perfect, the more truths it contains; perfection has various degrees â it is higher in poetry than in prose.\n\nIn classicism, especially in French 17th-century classicism, from an \"ideal\" attainable by few, perfection became an \"obligation\" for every author. And inasmuch as the criterion of perfection had been lowered, \"perfection\" now meant only \"correctness.\" In the ensuing devaluation, it was not enough that art be \"perfecta\", it should be \"perfectissima\".\n\nPerfection, formerly the \"supreme\" characterization for a work of art, now became but one of \"many\" positive characterizations. Cesare Ripa, in his \"Iconologia\" (published 1593, but typical for the 17th century), presented \"perfezione\" as a concept of equal status with grace (\"grazia\"), prettiness (\"venustÃ \") and beauty (\"bellezza\").\n\nLeibniz's pupil, Christian Wolff, in his \"Psychology\", wrote that beauty consists in perfection, and that this was why beauty was a source of pleasure. No such general esthetic theory, explicitly naming perfection, had ever been formulated by any of its devotees from Plato to Palladio.\nWolff's theory of beauty-as-perfection was developed by the school's chief aesthetician, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten. This tradition remained active in Germany as late as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, who considered both beauty and sublimity to be ideas of perfection; when unity prevailed, beauty emerged; when plurality â sublimity.\n\nIn the latter part of the 18th century, Immanuel Kant wrote much in his \"Critique of Judgment\" about perfection â inner and outer, objective and subjective, qualitative and quantitative, perceived clearly and obscurely, the perfection of nature and that of art. Nevertheless, in aesthetics Kant found that \"The judgment of taste [i.e., aesthetic judgment] is entirely independent of the concept of perfection\" â that is, beauty was something different from perfection.\n\nEarlier in the 18th century, France's leading aesthetician, Denis Diderot, had questioned whether perfection was a more comprehensible idea than beauty. Jean-Jacques Rousseau had treated perfection as an unreal concept, and wrote Jean le Rond d'Alembert, \"Let us not seek the chimera of perfection, but that which is the best possible.\"\n\nIn England, in 1757, the important aesthetician Edmund Burke denied that perfection was the cause of beauty. Quite the contrary, he argued that beauty nearly always involved an element of \"imperfection\"; for example, women, in order to heighten their attractiveness, emphasized their weakness and frailty, which is to say, their imperfection.\n\nThe 18th century was the last for which perfection was a principal concept in aesthetics. In the 19th century, perfection survived only vestigially as a general expression of approval. Alfred de Musset held that \"Perfection is no more attainable for us than is infinity. One ought not to seek it anywhere: not in love, nor beauty, nor happiness, nor virtue; but one should love it, in order to be virtuous, beautiful and happy, insofar as that is possible for man.\"\n\nIn the 20th century, Paul ValÃ©ry wrote: \"To strive for perfection, to devote endless time to a work, to set oneselfâlike Goetheâan unattainable goal, are all intents that are precluded by the pattern of modern life.\"\n\nThe dismissal of the question concerning whether artists \"can\" achieve perfection, still left the question: Do artists \"want\" to achieve it? Is that their actual goal? Some artists, schools and epochs \"have\" aimed for perfection. Others have nurtured \"other\" goals: pluralism, novelty, powerful sensations, faithfulness to truth, self-expression and expression of the world, creativity and originality â all of which may roughly be summarized as \"expression.\"\n\nThere have been ages of perfection, and ages of expression. The arts of ancient Greece, the Renaissance and neoclassicism were arts of perfection. In the mannerist, baroque and romantic periods, expression has prevailed.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Anaximander described the world as \"endless\" (\"apeiron\"), Xenophanes â as \"the greatest\" (\"megistos\"). But while they ascribed great qualities to the world, they did not regard it as perfect.\nOnly Parmenides seems to have considered existence to be \"\"tetelesmenon\"\" (\"finished\"); and Melissos, his successor in the Eleatic school, said that existence \"was entirely\" (\"\"pan esti\"\"). Thus both saw perfection in existence; true existence was one, constant, immutable. Moreover, Parmenides thought the world to be finite, limited in all directions, and like a sphere â which was a mark of its perfection.\n\nParmenides' view was embraced to some extent by Plato. He thought that the world was the work of a good Demiurge, and that this was why order and harmony prevailed in the world. The world was the best, the most beautiful, perfect. It had a perfect shape (spherical) and a perfect motion (circular).\n\nBut Plato said nothing about the Demiurge architect-of-the-world himself being perfect. And understandably so, for perfection implied finitude, limits; whereas it was the world, not its creator, that had limits. A similar view was held by Aristotle: the world could be perfect, but God could not.\n\nOnly the pantheist Stoics held the divinity to be perfect â precisely because they identified it with the world. Cicero wrote in \"De natura deorum\" (On the Nature of the Gods) that the world \"encompasses... within itself all beings... And what could be more nonsensical than denying perfection to an all-embracing being... Besides the world, there is no thing that does not lack something and that is harmonious, perfect and finished in every respect...\"\n\nAt a certain moment, Greek philosophy became bound up with the religion of the Christians: the abstract concept of first cause became linked with the religious concept of God; the \"primum movens\" became identified with the Creator, the absolute with the divine Person. Features of an absolute existence were discovered in the Person of the Creator: He was immutable, timeless. And absolute existence took on the attributes of a person: it was good, omnipotent, omnipresent. Christian theology united the features of the first cause in Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\" with those of the Creator in the \"Book of Genesis\". But the attributes of God did not include perfection, for a perfect being must be \"finite\"; only of such a being might one say that it lacked nothing.\n\nThere was another reason for the denial, to God, of perfection â in a branch of Christian theology that was under the influence of Plotinus. In this view, the absolute from which the world derived could not be grasped in terms of human concepts, even the most general and transcendent. Not only was that absolute not matter, it was not spirit either, nor idea; it was superior to these. It exceeded any description or praise; it was incomprehensible and ineffable; it was beyond all that we may imagine â including perfection.\n\nMedieval Christian philosophy held that the concept of perfection might describe Creation, but was not appropriate to describe God. Saint Thomas Aquinas, indicating that he was following Aristotle, defined a perfect thing as one that \"possesses that of which, by its nature, it is capable.\" Also (\"Summa Theologica\"): \"That is perfect, which lacks nothing of the perfection proper to it.\" Thus there were, in the world, things perfect and imperfect, more perfect and less perfect. God permitted imperfections in Creation when they were necessary for the good of the whole. And for man it was natural to go by degrees from imperfection to perfection.\n\nDuns Scotus understood perfection still more simply and mundanely: \"Perfection is that which it is better to have than not to have.\" It was not an attribute of God but a property of creation: all things partook of it to a greater or lesser degree. A thing's perfection depended on what sort of perfection it was eligible for. In general, that was perfect which had attained the fullness of the qualities possible for it. Hence \"whole\" and \"perfect\" meant more or less the same (\"\"totum et perfectum sunt quasi idem\"\").\nThis was a teleological concept, for it implied an end (goal or purpose). God created things that served certain purposes, created even those purposes, but He himself did not serve any purpose. Since God was not finite, He could not be called perfect: for the concept of perfection served to describe \"finite\" things. Perfection was not a theological concept, but an ontological one, because it was a feature, in some degree, of every being. The 9th-century thinker Paschasius Radbertus wrote: \"Everything is the more perfect, the more it resembles God.\" Still, this did not imply that God himself was perfect.\n\nThe concept of perfection, as an attribute of God, entered theology only in modern times, through RenÃ© Descartes â and in the \"plural\", as the \"perfections\" of God.\n\nAfter Descartes, the concept of perfection as a principal concept in philosophy was upheld by other great 17th-century thinkers. In Benedict Spinoza's philosophy, however, there was no personal God, and perfection became a property of â even a synonym for â the existence of reality (that is, for the essence of things).\n\nLeibniz wrote: \"As M. Descartes states, \"existence\" itself is perfection.\" Leibniz added: \"Perfection, I call any simple quality, if it is positive and absolute, such that, if it expresses something, it does so without limits.\"\n\nAt the same time, Leibniz also construed perfection, in his \"Monadology\", in an utterly different way: \"Only that is perfect which possesses no limits, that is, only God.\" This concept would last out the entire 17th century. Subsequently, Immanuel Kant would describe perfection as \"\"omnitudo realitatis\"\" (\"the omnitude of reality\"). Thus perfection, which during the Middle Ages could be a property of any individual being, in 17th-century philosophy became as well, and indeed preeminently, a property of God.\n\nLeibniz's pupil and successor, Christian Wolff, took up this concept of perfection â but with a difference. Wolff ascribed perfection not to being as a whole, but once again to its individual constituents. He gave, as examples, an eye that sees faultlessly, and a watch that runs faultlessly. He also distinguished variants â \"perfectio simplex\" and \"composita\", \"primaria\" and \"secundaria\" â and differentiated the magnitude of perfection (\"magnitudo perfectionis\").\n\nWolff's pupil, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, derived perfection from rules, but anticipated their collisions (\"regularum collisio\") leading to exceptions (\"exceptio\") and limiting the perfection of things. Baumgarten distinguished perfection \"simplex\" and \"composita\", \"interna\" and \"externa\", \"transcendentalis\" and \"accidentalis\"; and, positing so broad a construction, he arrived at the conclusion that \"everything is perfect.\"\n\nIn short, Wolff and his pupils had returned to the ontological concept of perfection that the Scholastics had used. The \"theological\" concept of perfection had lived only from Descartes to Leibniz, in the 17th century.\n\nThanks to Wolff's school, the concept of perfection lasted in Germany through the 18th century. In other western countries, however, especially France and Britain, in that century the concept of perfection was already in decline. It was ignored by the French \"Grande EncyclopÃ©die\".\n\nThe history of the concept of perfection had undergone great evolutions â from \"\"Nothing\" in the world is perfect\", to \"\"Everything\" is perfect\"; and from \"Perfection is \"not\" an attribute of God\", to \"Perfection \"is\" an attribute of God.\"\n\nWith Christian Wolff's school, every thing had become perfect. This was a singular moment in the history of the ontological concept of perfection; and soon thereafter, that history came to an end.\n\nThe foregoing discussion shows that the \"term\" \"perfection\" has been used to designate a variety of \"concepts\":\n\nExcept for the first, mathematical sense, all these concepts of \"perfection\" show a kinship and oscillate between ideal and approximation.\n\nHowever, the expression \"perfect\" is also used colloquially as a superlative (\"perfect idiot,\" \"perfect scoundrel,\" \"perfect storm\"). Here \"perfectum\" is confused with \"excellens\" of an approving, admiring or condemnatory kind.\n\nPerfection has also been construed as that which is \"the best\". In theology, when Descartes and Leibniz termed God \"perfect,\" they had in mind something other than \"model\"; than that which \"lacks nothing\"; than that \"achieves its purpose\"; than that fulfills its functions; or than that \"is harmonious\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928379", "title": "Comparison of Indonesian and Standard Malay", "text": "Comparison of Indonesian and Standard Malay\n\nMalaysian and Indonesian are two standardised varieties of the Malay language, used in Malaysia and Indonesia, respectively. Both varieties are generally mutually intelligible, yet there are noticeable differences in spelling, grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary, as well as the predominant source of loanwords. The differences can range from those mutually unintelligible with one another, to those having a closer familial resemblance. The regionalised and localised varieties of Malay can become a catalyst for intercultural conflict, especially in higher education.\n\nTo non-native speakers the two varieties may seem identical, but to native speakers the differences are noticeable through both diction and accent. They affect the broadcasting industry with regard to foreign language subtitling, for example, in DVD movies and on cable TV. In order to reach a wider audience, both Indonesian and Malay subtitles are sometimes displayed in a movie, along with other language subtitles. Another example is Malaysian TV providing Malay subtitling on Indonesian sinetrons (TV dramas) aired in Malaysia, and vice versa.\n\nThe Malay language in Indonesia and Malaysia also differs in recognition, where in Malaysia it enjoys status as the national language (Malaysian language), while in Indonesia it is considered a regional language in Malay-speaking areas such as the eastern coast of Sumatra and West Kalimantan. The term \"Malay language\" (\"Bahasa Melayu\") in Indonesia and Malaysia invites different perceptions from its respective people. To Malaysians, the Malay language is generally understood as the national language of Malaysia, with Malaysian language (\"Bahasa Malaysia)\" being a precise appellation for the Malay variety used in the country. Between 1986 and 2007, the term \"Bahasa Melayu\" was used instead of \"Bahasa Malaysia\", until the latter was reinstated, in order to instill a sense of belonging among Malaysians of all races, rather than just Malays. Therefore, there was no clear distinction between the use of the term Malay (\"Bahasa Melayu\") and the national language of Malaysia (\"Bahasa Malaysia\"). In Brunei, where Malay is also an official language, the language is known as \"Bahasa Melayu\" and in English as \"Malay\".\n\nIn Indonesia, however, there is a clear distinction between \"Malay language\" (\"bahasa Melayu\") and \"Indonesian\" (\"bahasa Indonesia\"). Indonesian is the national language which serves as the unifying language of Indonesia; despite being a standardized form of Malay, it is not referred to with the term \"Malay\" in common parlance. The term \"Malay\" is usually reserved for the forms of Malay indigenous to the Malay ethnic group (the national standardized language of Malaysia and the non-standard idioms of Malay people, including those used by Malay Indonesians). Thus, \"Malay\" is considered a regional language (\"bahasa daerah\") in Indonesia, enjoying the same status as e.g. Javanese, Sundanese, Buginese, Balinese, Batak languages and others. Moreover, to some Indonesians, the term \"Malay\" is more often associated with Malaysia and the Malaysian variety of Malay.\n\nIn Malaysia, the terms \"Indonesian Malay\" and \"Malaysian Malay\" are sometimes used for Indonesian and Malaysian as spoken in Malaysia. In Indonesia, \"Indonesian Malay\" usually refers to the vernacular varieties of Malay spoken by the Malay peoples of Indonesia, that is, to Malay as a regional language in Sumatra, though it is rarely used. \"Bahasa Malaysia\" and \"Bahasa Melayu\" are used interchangeably in reference to Malay in Malaysia.\n\nBefore the 20th century, Malay was written in a local modified form of the Arabic alphabet known as Jawi. During the 20th century, Malay written with Roman letters, known as Rumi, almost completely replaced Jawi in everyday life. The romanisations originally used in Malaya (now part of Malaysia) and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) reflected their past history as British and Dutch colonial possessions respectively. In Malaya, the romanisation of Malay, devised by Richard Wilkinson was influenced by English, whereas in the Dutch East Indies, the system devised by C. A. Van Ophuijsen was influenced by Dutch. As a result, in Indonesia, the vowel in the English word 'moon' was formerly represented \"oe\", as in Dutch, although the official spelling of this sound was changed to \"u\" in 1947 when the Republican Spelling System was used.\n\nSimilarly, until 1972, the initial consonant of the English 'chin' was represented in Malaysia as \"ch\", whereas in Indonesia, it continued to follow Dutch and used \"tj\". Hence the word for 'grandchild' used to be written as ' in Malaysia and ' in Indonesia, until a unified spelling system was introduced in 1972 (known in Indonesia as ' or the 'Perfected Spelling') which removed most differences between the two varieties: Malay \"ch\" and Indonesian \"tj\" became \"c\": hence '. Indonesia abandoned the spelling \"dj\" (for the consonant at the beginning of the word 'Jakarta') to conform to the \"j\" already in use in Malaysia, while the old Indonesian \"j\" for the semivowel at the beginning of the English 'young', was replaced with \"y\" as in Malaysia. Likewise, the velar fricative which occurs in many Arabic loanwords, which used to be written 'ch' in Indonesian, became \"kh\" in both languages. However, \"oe\" was retained in some proper names, such as the name of the former vice-president, Boediono or former minister Mohammad Roem. The \"ch\" and \"dj\" letter combinations are still encountered in names such as \"Achmad\" and \"Djojo\" (pronounced as \"Akhmad\" and \"Joyo\" respectively), although the post-1972 spelling is now favoured.\n\nAlthough the representations of speech sounds are now largely identical in the Indonesian and Malay standards, a number of minor spelling differences remain, usually for historical reasons. For instance, the word for 'money' is written as ' in Malaysia, but ' in Indonesia, the word for 'try' is written as ' in Malaysia, but ' in Indonesia, the word for 'because' is written as ' in Malaysia, but ' in Indonesia, while the word for 'cake' is written as ' in Malaysia, but ' in Indonesia. One notable difference in punctuation between the two languages is the use of different decimal marks; Indonesian, influenced by Dutch, uses the decimal comma, whereas Malay, influenced by English, uses the decimal point.\n\nPronunciation also tends to be very different, with East Malaysia, Brunei and East Indonesia pronouncing words in a form called \"Bahasa Baku\", where the words are pronounced as spelled. and enunciation tends to be clipped, staccato and faster than on the Malay Peninsula, which is spoken at a more languorous pace. Many vowels are pronounced (and were formerly spelt) differently in Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and Sumatra: ' is pronounced (and was spelt) ', ' as ', etc., and many final \"a\"'s tend to be pronounced as schwas; and are also allophones of and in closed final syllables in peninsular Malaysian, Singaporean and Sumatran varieties of Malay.\n\nIndonesian differs from Malaysian in the quantity of loanwords from Javanese, Dutch and other languages. For example, the word for 'post office' in Malaysia is \"\" (in Indonesia this means 'post officer'), whereas in Indonesia it is \"\", from the Dutch word for office, '. There are also some Portuguese influences: in Indonesia, Christmas is known as \"\", whereas Malaysia uses \"\", derived from English (or in some cases also \"\", due to Indonesian influence). Pronunciation of certain loanwords in Standard Malay follows English, while in Indonesian it follows Dutch, for example Malay \"\" (from English: television) and Indonesian \"\" (from Dutch: '); the \"-syen\" and \"-si\" also prevail in some other words. There are also instances where the Malaysian version derives from English pronunciation while the Indonesian version takes its cue from Latin. The Latin preference of the (older) Indonesian intellectuals in these instances may be ascribed to the influence of their classical-oriented education when \"Gymnasium\" schools were established during the Dutch colonial period : compare Malay ', ', ', ' and ' with Indonesian ', ', ', ' and '.\n\nSome words which are spelt the same in both languages may even carry entirely different meanings in the other language, potentially leading to humorous or embarrassing situations: while ' means \"steel\" in Indonesian, in Malaysian it means \"fertiliser\". Also, whereas the Indonesian word ' means \"require\" or \"need\", in Malaysian, it is a vulgar slang term equivalent to \"cunt/cock\". Conversely, where the word \"\" seems innocuous enough in Malaysia (\"census\"), in Indonesia it is a derogatory term for \"transvestite\".\n\nThe relatively large share of Islamic (Arabic or Persian) loan words shared by Malaysian and Indonesian often poses no difficulty in comprehension and usage, although some forms may have developed a (slightly) different meaning or have become obsolete either in Malaysian or in Indonesian, e.g. ', ' (see below).\n\nBesides vocabulary differences, there are also a number of false friends in both languages. As these words are in quite common use in either or both of the languages, misunderstandings can arise.\n\nOne of the most important aspect in differences between Malaysian and Indonesian is the degree of influence from English. Apart from being heavily influenced by the Dutch language, Indonesian language also adopted a significant number of English loanwords in its vocabulary, although English did not play significant role on the Indonesian language and in fact most of these vocabulary are of Dutch origin â Dutch and English share a similar Germanic origin, and Dutch has also borrowed from Latin, although to a lesser extent than English. There have been many changes in Indonesian as a result of its historical development. Words have been freely borrowed from English and only partly assimilated, in many cases, to the Indonesian patterns of structure.\n\nBy the late 1970s, English words began pouring into the language, leading one commentator, writing in 1977, to refer to the \"trend towards Indo-Saxonization\", known in Indonesian as '. Many loanwords from English sometimes fulfill no communicative need, expressing concepts adequately covered by existing words. Among the examples are: ' instead of ' (accurate), ' in the place of ' (alliance), ' rather than ' (exist), ' as well as ' (candidate), ' instead of ' (conclusion) ' in the place of ' (contamination), ' rather than ' (opinion) and ' in the place of \" (option). Contrary to its Indonesian counterpart, Malay has shown a remarkable resilience, despite formerly being part of British Empire.\n\nSome in Indonesia view this trend of excessive borrowings as \"language dynamism\", while some Malaysian linguists called it mass \"language pollution\", and lack of creativity in creating new terms.\n\nThe original text in Indonesian:\n\nThe same text rendered in Malaysian:\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nThe rift of evolution between the two languages is based more on political nuance and the history of their formation than on cultural reasons. As a result, views regarding each other's languages differ amongst Malaysians and Indonesians. In Malaysia, the national language is Malaysian; in Indonesia, it is Indonesian. Malaysians tend to assert that Malaysian and Indonesian are merely different varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate â albeit closely related â languages. The result of this attitude is that the Indonesians feel little need to synchronize their language with Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, whereas the Malaysians are keener to coordinate the evolution of the language with the Indonesians. However, both parties have realized that communication benefits from mutually comprehensible and intelligible languages, which motivated efforts to synchronize the languages' development. The effort to synchronize both languages' evolution to increase their mutual intelligibility has been embarked by imposing standard rules of language. This process is headed by Pusat Bahasa on the Indonesian side and Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka as its Malaysian counterpart. Authorities in both Brunei and Singapore generally abide by the Malaysian standard in disputes.\n\nThe following texts are excerpts from the official translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Indonesian and Malay, along with the original declaration in English.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928390", "title": "Treak Cliff Cavern", "text": "Treak Cliff Cavern\n\nTreak Cliff Cavern is a show cave near Castleton in Derbyshire, England. It is part of the Castleton Site of Special Scientific Interest and one of only two sites where the ornamental mineral Blue John is still excavated (the other is the nearby Blue John Cavern). As part of an agreement with English Nature, the Blue John that can be seen in the show cave is not mined but it is extracted in small quantities from other areas of the cave and made into saleable items like bowls, jewellery and ornaments.\n\nThe cave comprises two sections, the Old Series, discovered by lead miners in the 18th century, and the New Series, discovered during blasting in the 1920s. Only the Old Series contains Blue John, but the New Series is well decorated with flowstone, stalagmites and stalactites. Three human skeletons and flint implements from the Neolithic era were found in a small cave nearby in 1921.\n\nTreak Cliff, the hill in which the cavern lies, is composed of Carboniferous Limestone; the steep eastern slope of the hill is thought to have been the edge of a reef on the margin of a tropical lagoon. This reef was then raised above sea level by an uplift in the Earth's crust and was subsequently eroded, forming a boulder bed on the slopes. This was subsequently overlain by deltaic river sediments, which formed the shale and Millstone Grit sandstones that still overlay the limestone to the north, and on top of those the Coal Measures formed, until the limestone was deep beneath the surface and subject to high temperature and pressure. Major earth movements at the end of the Carboniferous period reversed this subsidence, and the rock layers were raised to form an anticline, the top of which was eroded away. Surface streams, on meeting the limestone, percolated through cracks and weaknesses and started to dissolve the limestone to form caverns. The stream that formed the New Series once flowed into the lower end of Winnats Pass, whereas the stream that formed the Old Series lost its headwaters to the predecessor of the modern Odin Sitch as it cut down through soft shales. There is no modern stream in the Treak Cliff Cavern, but percolating water from the cave has been dye-tested and found to emerge at the Russet Well beside Peakshole Water near Peak Cavern in Castleton, taking between 13 and 20 hours to travel the distance.\nSince their original formation, the caverns have been decorated by the formation of flowstone, stalagmites and stalactites. Two stalagmite samples from the Aladdin's Cave section of the Treak Cliff Cavern have been found, by means of radioactive dating, to date back 111,000 years, proving the cave itself is much older. The formations in Treak Cliff are variously stained orange or red by iron, white by lead and occasionally green or blue by copper. Some of the stalactites have been distorted by variations in the flow to form twisted structures known as helictites.\n\nTrace elements from buried sediments, percolating rain water, and trapped sea water meant various inorganic ions were present within the porous rock, among them chlorine, fluorine, sulphate, calcium, barium, lead, zinc and even uranium. Organic material from the decomposing bodies of marine animals in the sediments formed hydrocarbons, precursors of oil and gas. At high pressure a hot mineralised fluid formed and was forced into fractures and other voids in the rock. From this fluid, catalysed by the hydrocarbons, compounds such as galena (lead sulphide, PbS), sphalerite (zinc sulphide, ZnS), baryte (barium sulphate, BaSO) and fluorspar (calcium fluoride, CaF) were precipitated as solid crystals. At Treak Cliff the mineralised fluid was particularly rich in fluorine and 99% of the deposited mineral is fluorspar (technically, fluorite is the pure crystal and fluorspar the industrial name for the impure substance as mined). The exploitable deposits of fluorspar are known as \"rakes\", \"scrins\", \"flats\" or \"pipes\" depending on the size and shape of the voids in which the crystals were deposited.\nAt Treak Cliff and nearby Blue John Cavern, the fluorspar is uniquely banded, ranging from blue-black to white. The exact cause of the coloration is disputed, but it seems that the formation of Blue John requires a rare combination of porous limestone containing a little hydrocarbon, small traces of radioactive elements, an impervious layer to prevent the mineral fluids and hydrocarbons from escaping, a high concentration of fluorine ions, and variations in conditions during the crystallization process to form the banded colours. The rarity of this combination of conditions explains the scarcity of Blue John.\n\nBecause of the attractive banding, and the rarity of the mineral, Blue John has commercial value and ornaments made from it are much sought after by collectors. Historically, as well as from Treak Cliff and Blue John Cavern, veins of the mineral were also worked from Old Tor Mine and another mine in Winnats Pass, and also from mines near Windy Knoll and Odin Mine, towards Mam Tor. Limited opencast extraction of Blue John took place on the top of Treak Cliff during World War II, and an incident of unofficial and illegal extraction from Old Tor Mine in the 1970s led to that mine being closed by order of H.M. Inspector of Mines, leaving Treak Cliff and Blue John Cavern as the two remaining sources of new stocks of the mineral. Both caves have a policy of supplying raw Blue John only to shops within Castleton, so the few outlets selling it elsewhere rely on old stocks.\n\nThe Old Series is thought to have been discovered in about 1745â50 by miners seeking lead ore, and is known to have been a source of Blue John by the 1750s, at which time it was known as Millers Mine. Extraction continued throughout the 19th century, including some opencast working on the hilltop above. There is no historical evidence of the caves being shown to the public during this period, though the nearby Blue John Caverns were opened to the public in around 1800 and extended around 1843.\nDemand for fluorspar increased during World War I and much ornamental Blue John was extracted for use as flux in blast furnaces and in the chemical industry. In 1921 miners discovered the remains of three human skeletons dated to the Neolithic period in a nearby cave close to the surface. A little later, in 1926, miners blasting with explosives discovered an extension to the natural cavern, a section well decorated with stalactites: the New Series.\n\nCommercial mining ended shortly after 1926 but in the 1930s miners returning to retrieve stored Blue John discovered a new, easier route into the New Series. This encouraged the development of the cave as a tourist attraction and the landowner entrusted John Royse, whose father and grandfather had been agents for Blue John, to adapt it for public display. It opened to the public at Easter 1935. Named sections within the show cave include the Witch's Cave, the Fossil Cave, Aladdin's Cave, Fairyland, the Dream Cave and the Dome of St Paul's. Some of the formations have also been given names, according to their perceived resemblance to other objects, such as the Stork, which forms part of the cavern's corporate logo, and the adjacent Ram's Head, both within the Dream Cave.\n\nIn 1945 the management of the cavern was taken over by the Harrison family who still operate it. The outgoing tenant John Royse, who was close to retirement, reported he had discovered a significant and previously unknown source of Blue John in the cave. Royse intended to return with the 19-year-old Peter Harrison but died before he could describe the location. The lost vein, concealed by wooden battens, a piece of carpet and a layer of clay, was rediscovered in 2013 by John Turner, Peter Harrison's grandson. At current rates of extraction the find is expected to last for at least a decade. The discovery prompted a visit by the BBC's \"Countryfile\" programme later that year.\n\nIn 2015, another vein of Blue John was discovered close to the tourist route by a miner experimenting with a new method of exploration using a specialist chainsaw. The first new source for 150 years, it was named the Ridley Vein after its discoverer.\n\n"}
{"id": "1928393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928393", "title": "Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict", "text": "Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict\n\nThe Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC), also known as the child soldier treaty, is a multilateral treaty whereby states agree to: 1) prohibit the conscription into the military of children under the age of 18; 2) ensure that military recruits are no younger than 16; and 3) prevent recruits aged 16 or 17 from taking a direct part in hostilities. The treaty also forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for any purpose.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly adopted the treaty as a supplementary protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child by resolution 54/263 on 25 May 2000. The protocol came into force on 12 February 2002.\n\nAs of May 2020, 170 states are party to the protocol. A further 10 states have signed but not ratified it and 17 states have not signed it.\n\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) defines a child as any person under the age of 18.\n\nThroughout history and in many cultures, children have had extensive involvement in military campaigns. In World War I, in Great Britain 250,000 boys under 18 managed to join the army. In World War II, child soldiers fought throughout Europe, in the Warsaw Uprising, in the Jewish resistance, and in the Soviet Army. After the Cold War ended, the number of armed conflicts grew and the use of children for military purposes surged, affecting as many as 300,000 children worldwide annually by the end of the 1990s.\n\nProgress towards ending the use of children for military purposes has been slow, partly because many national armed forces have relied on children to fill their ranks. Initial efforts to limit the participation of children in armed conflict began with the adoption of the Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977 (Art. 77.2). The new Protocols prohibited the military recruitment of children aged under 15 and their direct participation in hostilities, but continued to allow state armed forces and non-state armed groups to recruit children from age 15 and use them in warfare. In addition, the Protocols did not prohibit belligerents from using children younger than 15 in hostilities when their participation was not \"direct\"; for example, as scouts, porters, informants, spies, message-carriers and in other support roles.\n\nWhen the same limited standards were incorporated into the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in 1989, children's rights advocates were left frustrated, believing that a treaty establishing the fundamental rights of children ought to protect them from all forms of military involvement. To achieve this, a small group of human rights campaigners and sympathetic governments began a global campaign for a new treaty, which was adopted in 2000 as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC).\n\nBy 1994, five years after the Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted, children's rights advocates and sympathetic governments had persuaded the international community to establish a working group of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Its mandate was to begin negotiations on a new protocol to the Convention that would raise standards regarding the use of children for military purposes.\n\nWhile the large majority of states negotiating the protocol were willing to end all military recruitment of children under the age of 18 (the so-called \"straight-18\" principle), a small number were opposed: Bangladesh, Cuba, Israel, South Korea, Kuwait, Pakistan, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). According to Jo Becker, a human rights advocate actively involved in the negotiations:\n\nGovernments began a series of annual negotiations in Geneva, but by 1998, negotiations floundered as it became clear that governments that had long used under-eighteens in their national armed forces, notably the United States and United Kingdom, were not willing to support a new standard that conflicted with their national practice.\n\nWhile some of the states opposed to the change said nevertheless that they would not block it, the US insisted on its position, according to Becker.\n\nInstrumental in gathering high-level support for the treaty was a proposal by children's rights advocates for a major study on the effect of armed conflict on children. The study was proposed by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, commissioned by the UN General Assembly, and produced by GraÃ§a Machel in 1996: \"Impact of armed conflict on children\". The report was particularly concerned with the use of younger children as participants in armed conflict, presenting evidence that many thousands of children were being killed, maimed, and psychiatrically injured around the world every year. It also called for an end to the recruitment of children by all armed forces.\n\nAs negotiations on the new treaty stalled in 1998, the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now known as Child Soldiers International) was established by six human rights and humanitarian organizations (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Federation Terre des Hommes, Jesuit Refugee Service, the Quaker United Nations Office (Geneva) and Save the Children). With the goal of incorporating the straight-18 principle into the new treaty, the Coalition quickly seeded national affiliates in more than thirty countries. The Coalition worked in alliance with a small group of states actively advocating for the straight-18 principle internationally: Canada, Denmark, Ethiopia, Finland, Japan, Mozambique, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nWith initial funding from the Canadian government, the Coalition organised a series of intergovernmental regional conferences; the African and Latin-American conferences strongly supported the straight-18 principle. The European conference supported an end to the participation of children in armed conflict, but not their recruitment, due to opposition from Austria, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the UK, which were all recruiting children aged 16 or 17 into their own armed forces. (As of 2017, all except Luxembourg were still doing so.)\n\nBy 1999, the straight-18 principle enjoyed the support of the large majority of states, as well as the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Labour Organization, the European Parliament, the Organization of African Unity, and the World Council of Churches.\n\nIn the final negotiations, only five states still advocated against the straight-18 principle: Egypt, Kuwait, Singapore, the UK and, most trenchantly, the US. The US, with British support, continued to insist that it would not support a treaty that prevented it from sending 17 year-olds into battle. According to Becker, the US relented following an intervention from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, although the US and UK continued to insist on their right to recruit children from age 16 (UK) and 17 (US).\n\nThis change allowed a compromise consensus between the negotiating parties, in which the new treaty would not prevent states from recruiting children into their armed forces from age 16 or 17, but would require that \"all feasible measures\" be taken to ensure that children did not participate \"directly\" in hostilities.\n\nThe OPAC treaty has been widely ratified. As of February 2018, 170 states had ratified or acceded to the treaty; a further 10 states had signed but not yet ratified it.\n\nIn addition, following OPAC's adoption the number of states restricting enlistment to adults aged over 18 has increased substantially, according to Child Soldiers International: from 83 in 2001 to 126 in 2016, which is 71 percent of countries with armed forces. These include several states where child recruitment had been routine, including Colombia and Sierra Leone. Approximately 60 non-state armed groups have also entered agreements to stop or scale back their use of children.\n\nDespite this trend, Child Soldiers International reports that the recruitment of children for military purposes remains widespread, including by armed forces in the three most populous countries â China, India and the United States â and the most economically powerful (all G7 countries apart from Italy and Japan). A large number of non-state armed groups also recruit and use children routinely, especially following a recent surge in child recruitment by militant Islamist movements in Africa and the Middle East, as well as by militias opposing them.\n\nOn 21 February 2018 a meeting was held at the UN to mark the treaty's 18th anniversary. The meeting, co-sponsored by Child Soldiers International, UNICEF, and the governments of Belgium, Canada, Colombia, France and Sierra Leone, was attended by approximately 100 delegates. The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba, reported on the progress made and still to be achieved since the treaty was adopted:\n\nWe have really come a long way. Today, 18 years later, we should celebrate the quantifiable progress accomplished. The issue of children and armed conflict has been squarely placed on the international peace and security agenda. Since 2000, at least 130,000 child soldiers were released due to the collective efforts of child protection actors. Thousands more were spared the ordeal of recruitment and use â because their country has joined OPAC and put in place measures to protect them. Making sure all boys and girls released and their communities have access to meaningful reintegration â to help them overcome the harrowing experiences they have been through â is essential. But this remains a huge challenge.\n\nThe main obligations of the OPAC treaty are as follows:\n\nOther provisions of the treaty include the following:\n\nThe sentence \"States Parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities\" was adapted from Article 77.2 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, adopted in 1977, with an alteration from fifteen years to eighteen years and some other minor modifications. (\"The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces.\")\n\nThe ICRC commentary on Protocol I makes clear that it does not require a complete ban on the use of children in conflict. The ICRC had proposed that the Protocol require parties to \"take all \"necessary\" measures\" but final text uses the wording \"take all \"feasible\" measures\" which is not a total prohibition on their doing so. Furthermore, refraining from recruiting children under fifteen does not exclude children who volunteer for armed service. During the negotiations over the clause \"take a part in hostilities,\" the word \"direct\" was added, opening up the possibility that child volunteers could be involved indirectly in hostilities, gathering and transmitting military information, helping in the transportation of arms and munitions, provision of supplies, etc.\n\nThe Australian Defence Force Cadets follows the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict but still accepts cadets between the ages of 13â18 (except staff) and sometimes brings them onto ADF bases.\n\nAs noted above, at the time of OPAC's negotiation, the UK joined the US in actively resisting the majority view of negotiating states that 18 should be the minimum age for all forms of military recruitment. Then, as now, the UK permits its armed forces to enlist from age 16, and allows children to apply aged 15 years, 7 months.\n\nOn ratification of the treaty, the UK's binding declaration stated its understanding that, while it would endeavour not to use child recruits in hostilities, the protocol \"... would not exclude the deployment of members of its armed forces under the age of 18 to take a direct part in hostilities where: a) there is a genuine military need to deploy their unit or ship to an area in which hostilities are taking place; and b) by reason of the nature and urgency of the situation:- i) it is not practicable to withdraw such persons before deployment; or ii) to do so would undermine the operational effectiveness of their ship or unit, and thereby put at risk the successful completion of the military mission and/or the safety of other personnel.\"\n\nAccording to Child Soldiers International, the UK deployed 22 armed forces personnel aged under 18 to Iraq and Afghanistan between 2003 and 2010. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has urged the UK to alter its policy so as to ensure that children cannot take part in hostilities under any circumstances.\n\n\n"}

This name changed to Bethesda United. In the 1930's Bethesda Victoria were involved in North Wales football circles, winning the North Wales Combination and NWCFA Cup in 1930-31.\n\nBethesda Athletic was formed in 1946. In the 1948â49 season they joined the Welsh National League (North) Division 1, and early years in the league saw them regularly finish bottom, or near bottom of the table. The late 1960's saw the club regularly finish near the top of the division, with the first league title coming in the 1970â71 season, and a period of relative success followed in this period.\n\nAthletic also enjoyed some good runs in the Welsh Cup, the English F.A.

A long Welsh Cup run in 1960 saw wins over Nantlle Vale, Penmaenmawr and Pwllheli which set up a Quarter Final date with Cardiff City which ended in a six nil defeat against the eventual winners. In 1976 they beat Oswestry Town but were knocked out by Bangor City at Farrar Road. The score was 4â2 goals from Broadhead, Olney and John Hughes for Bangor and Alan Leicester for Bethesda.\n\nIn the FA Cup Bethesda took Tamworth to two replays in 1970 before finally bowing out. In 1974 Bethesda knocked out South Liverpool in the Qualifying rounds of The FA Cup but were eventually beaten by Rhyl in a second replay after two drawn matches.\n\nThe club spent 28 seasons in the Welsh League (North) with their final season, 1976-77, bringing the club's second divisional Championship.\n\nThe 1977-78 season saw the club move to the Caernarfon & District League, where they remained for six seasons, before moving to the Gwynedd League for a singular season, where they finished in third position.\n\n1984â85 saw the club join the Welsh Alliance League, the successor to the Welsh League (North) as a founder member. For the first two seasons, the club were runners-up in the league, before in 1988â87 finishing as champions. In 1990 when fellow Welsh Alliance members Fflint, Conwy, Porthmadog and Connahâs Quay joined the newly formed Cymru Alliance, Bethesda remained in the Welsh Alliance League.\n\nAfter finishing third in the Welsh Alliance in 1990â91, the club decided to drop down to the local Caernarfon & District League where they remained until stepping up to the Gwynedd League after being crowned champions in 1997â98 season. After two seasons in this league they were promoted to the Welsh Alliance League in 2000 after being crowned champions for the 1999â2000 season.\n\nThe club spent nine years in the Welsh Alliance culminating in two successive championship winning years. In the 2007â08 season they were champions of the Welsh Alliance League but were refused promotion to the Cymru Alliance by the Football Association of Wales. Two players, Gareth Davies and Richie Owen, scored 70 goals between them over the course of the season..\n\nThe following season saw the club break the league's season goal-scoring record, with 146 goals - again securing the league title.. \n\nAfter also completing upgrades to their football ground, the club stepped up to the second tier of Welsh football â the Cymru Alliance.\n\nThe club spent a solitary season in the Cymru Alliance, finishing 9th from 17 clubs in 2009â10 season. \n\nThe club returned to the Alliance, competing for two subsequent seasons. In August 2012 they were not able to complete fixtures and were given 14 days by the league's Management Committee to resolve their issues. The club announced in September that it was disbanding and resigned from the league \"due to various circumstances\".\n\nAfter a season away - the club returned for the 2013â14 season but finished bottom of the Welsh Alliance Division 2 with just 6 points. The following season saw them finish 10th from 16 clubs, before they again left the league.\n\nThe club returned to the Gwynedd League, finishing bottom of the league in the 2016â17 season. The following season they withdrew from the league.\n\nIn 2018 it was announced that the club would return to the league again but they again resigned from the league in August 2018 without playing any games.\n\nThey were named as a returning club for the 2019â20 season to same league.\n\nThe club also has a ladies team, Bethesda Athletic Ladies, who were established in 2018. The play in the North Wales Womens Football League part of Wales' womens football pyramid. Their first season saw them compete in the second division, finishing the season as champions.

{"id": "1928408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928408", "title": "Chanel No. 5", "text": "Chanel No. 5\n\nChanel No. 5 was the first perfume launched by French couturier Gabrielle \"Coco\" Chanel in 1921. The scent formula for the fragrance was compounded by French-Russian chemist and perfumer Ernest Beaux. The design of its bottle has been an important part of the product's allure. Coco Chanel was the first face of the fragrance, appearing in the advertisement published by Harper's Bazaar in 1937.\n\nTraditionally, fragrances worn by women fell into two basic categories. \"Respectable women\" favored the essence of a single garden flower while sexually provocative perfumes heavy with animal musk or jasmine were associated with women of the demi-monde, prostitutes, or courtesans. Chanel sought a new scent that would appeal to the flapper and celebrate the liberated feminine spirit of the 1920s.\n\nAt the age of twelve, Chanel was handed over to the care of nuns, and for the next six years spent a stark, disciplined existence in a convent orphanage, Aubazine, founded by 12th-century Cistercians in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of central France. From her earliest days there, the number five had potent associations for her. For Chanel, the number five was especially esteemed as signifying the pure embodiment of a thing, its spirit, its mystic meaning. The paths that led Chanel to the cathedral for daily prayers were laid out in circular patterns repeating the number five.\n\nHer affinity for the number five co-mingled with the abbey gardens, and by extension the lush surrounding hillsides abounding with \"Cistus\" (rock roses).\n\nIn 1920, when presented with small glass vials containing sample scents numbered 1 to 5 and 20 to 24 for her assessment, she chose the fifth vial. Chanel told her master perfumer, Ernest Beaux, whom she had commissioned to develop a new fragrance, \"I present my dress collections on the fifth of May, the fifth month of the year and so we will let this sample number five keep the name it has already, it will bring good luck.\"\n\nChanel envisioned a design that would be an antidote for the over-elaborate, precious fussiness of the crystal fragrance bottles then in fashion popularized by Lalique and Baccarat. Her bottle would be \"pure transparencyÂ ...an invisible bottle\". It is generally considered that the bottle design was inspired by the rectangular beveled lines of the Charvet toiletry bottles, which, outfitted in a leather traveling case, were favored by her lover, Arthur \"Boy\" Capel. Some say it was the whiskey decanter he used that she admired and wished to reproduce in \"exquisite, expensive, delicate glass\".\n\nThe first bottle produced in 1922, differed from the Chanel No. 5 bottle known today. The original container had small, delicate, rounded shoulders and was sold only in Chanel boutiques to select clients. In 1924, when \"Parfums Chanel\" incorporated, the glass proved too thin to survive shipping and distribution. The bottle was modified with square, faceted corners, its only significant design change. In a 1924 marketing brochure, Parfums Chanel described the bottle as, \"the perfection of the product forbids dressing it in the customary artifices. Why rely on the art of the glassmaker...Mademoiselle is proud to present simple bottles adorned only by...precious teardrops of perfume of incomparable quality, unique in composition, revealing the artistic personality of their creator.\"\n\nUnlike the bottle, which has remained the same since the 1924 redesign, the stopper has gone through numerous modifications. The original stopper was a small glass plug. The octagonal stopper, which became a brand signature, was created in 1924, when the bottle shape was changed. The 1950s gave the stopper a bevel cut and a larger, thicker silhouette. In the 1970s the stopper became even more prominent but, in 1986, it was re-proportioned so its size was more harmonious with the scale of the bottle.\n\nThe \"pocket \"flaÃ§on\"\", designed to be carried in a purse, was introduced in 1934. The price and container size were reduced to appeal to a broader customer base.\n\nThe bottle, over the decades, has itself become an identifiable cultural artifact, so much so that Andy Warhol chose to commemorate its iconic status in the mid-1980s with his pop art, silk-screened, \"Ads: Chanel\".\n\nA limited-edition, crimson red crystal glass bottle in the three editions of Chanel No. 5, namely \"Eau de Parfum\", \"Parfum\", and \"L'Eau\", was launched for Christmas in 2018.\n\nIn 1924, Chanel made an agreement with the Wertheimer brothers, Pierre and Paul, directors of the perfume house Bourjois, creating a new corporate entity, Parfums Chanel. The Wertheimers agreed to manage production, marketing, and distribution of Chanel No.Â 5. The Wertheimers would receive a 70 percent share of the company, and ThÃ©ophile Bader, founder of the Paris department store Galeries Lafayette, would receive 20 percent. Bader had been instrumental in brokering the business connection by introducing Chanel to Pierre Wertheimer at the Longchamps races in 1922. For 10 percent of the stock, Chanel licensed her name to Parfums Chanel and removed herself from involvement in all business operations. Later, unhappy with the arrangement, Chanel worked for more than twenty years to gain full control of Parfums Chanel. She said that Pierre Wertheimer was \"the bandit who screwed me\".\n\nWorld War II brought with it the Nazi seizure of all Jewish-owned property and businesses, providing Chanel with the opportunity to gain control of Parfums Chanel and its most profitable product, Chanel No.Â 5. The Wertheimers were Jewish, and Chanel used her position as an \"Aryan\" to petition German officials to legalize her right to sole ownership.\n\nOn 5 May 1941, Chanel wrote to the government administrator charged with ruling on the disposition of Jewish financial assets. Her grounds for proprietary ownership were based on the claim that Parfums Chanel \"is still the property of Jews\" and had been legally \"abandoned\" by the owners.\n\nI have an indisputable right of priority ... the profits that I have received from my creations since the foundation of this business ... are disproportionate ... [and] you can help to repair in part the prejudices I have suffered in the course of these seventeen years.\n\nChanel was not aware that the Wertheimers, anticipating the forthcoming Nazi confiscations, had, in May 1940, legally turned control of Parfums Chanel over to a Christian, French businessman and industrialist Felix Amiot. At the end of World War II, Amiot returned Parfums Chanel to the Wertheimers.\n\nBy the mid-1940s, the worldwide sales of Chanel No. 5 amounted to nine million dollars annually (approximately US$240Â million today). The monetary stakes were high and Chanel was determined to wrest control of Parfums Chanel from the Wertheimers. Chanel's plan was to destroy customer confidence in the brand, tarnish the image, crippling its marketing and distribution. She let it be known that Chanel No.Â 5 was no longer the original fragrance created by \"Mademoiselle Chanel\", it was no longer being compounded according to her standards and what was now being offered to the public was an inferior product, one she could no longer endorse. Further, Chanel announced she would make available an authentic Chanel No.Â 5, to be named \"Mademoiselle Chanel No.Â 5\", offered to a group of select clients.\n\nChanel possibly was unaware that the Wertheimers, who had fled from France to New York in 1940, had instituted a process whereby the quality of Chanel No.Â 5 would not be compromised. In America the Wertheimers had recruited H. Gregory Thomas as European emissary for Parfums Chanel. Thomas's mission was to establish the mechanisms required to maintain the quality of the Chanel products, particularly its most profitable fragrance, Chanel No.Â 5. Thomas worked to ensure that the supply of key components, the oils of jasmine and tuberose, obtained exclusively from the fields of the valley of Siagne above the French town of Grasse, remained uninterrupted by war. Thomas was later promoted to position as president of Chanel US, a position he held for thirty-two years.\n\nChanel escalated her game plan by instigating a lawsuit against Parfums Chanel and the Wertheimers. The legal battle garnered wide publicity. \"The New York Times\" reported on 3 June 1946:\n\nThe suit asks that the French parent concern [Les Parfums Chanel] be ordered to cease manufacture and sale of all products bearing the name and restore to her the ownership and sole rights over the products, formulas and manufacturing process [on grounds of] \"inferior quality\".\n\nThe Wertheimers were aware of Chanel's collaboration during the Nazi occupation. \"Forbes\" magazine summarized the Wertheimers' dilemma: \"[Pierre Wertheimer worries that] a legal fight might illuminate Chanel's wartime activities and wreck her imageâand his business\".\n\nUltimately, the Wertheimers and Chanel came to an agreement, re-negotiating the original 1924 contract. On 17 May 1947, Chanel received her share of the wartime profits of Chanel No.Â 5, an amount equivalent to some nine million of today's dollars. Post-war, her share was two percent of all Chanel No.Â 5 sales worldwide. Her earnings were in the vicinity of US$25Â million a year, making her at the time one of the richest women in the world. The new arrangement also gave Chanel the freedom to create new scents, which would be independent of Parfums Chanel, with the proviso that none would contain the number 5 in its name. She never acted on this opportunity.\n\nChanel's initial marketing strategy was to generate buzz for her new fragrance by hosting a promotional event. She invited a group of elite friends to dine with her in an elegant restaurant in Grasse where she surprised and delighted her guests by spraying them with Chanel No.Â 5. The official launch place and date of Chanel No.Â 5 was in her boutique in the fifth month of the year, on the fifth day of the month: 5 May 1921. She infused the shop's dressing rooms with the scent, and she gave bottles to a select few of her high society friends. The success of Chanel No.Â 5 was immediate. Chanel's friend Misia Sert exclaimed: \"It was like a winning lottery ticket.\"\n\nParfums Chanel was the corporate entity established in 1924 to run the production, marketing, and distribution of the fragrance business. Chanel wanted to spread the sale of Chanel No.Â 5 from beyond her boutiques to the rest of the world. The first new market was New York City. The initial marketing was discreet and deliberately restricted. The first ad appeared in \"The New York Times\" on 16 December 1924. It was a small ad for Parfums Chanel announcing the Chanel line of fragrances available at Bonwit Teller, an upscale department store. In the ad, all the bottles were indistinguishable from each another, displaying all the Chanel perfumes available, Numbers 9, 11, 22, and the centerpiece of the line, No. 5. This was the extent of the advertising campaign in the 1920s and appeared only intermittently. In the US, the sale of Chanel No.Â 5 was promoted at perfume counters in high-end department stores. The \"Galeries Lafayette\" was the first retailer of the fragrance in Paris. In France itself, Chanel No.Â 5 was not advertised until the 1940s.\n\nThe first solo advertisement for Chanel No.Â 5 ran in \"The New York Times\" on 10 June 1934.\n\nIn the early-1940s, when other perfume makers were increasing brand exposure, Parfums Chanel took a contrary track and decreased advertising. In 1939 and 1940, Chanel ads had been prominent. By 1941, there was almost no Chanel print advertising. Fragrance sales flourished during World War II. Perfume sales in the United States from 1940 to 1945 increased tenfold; Chanel No.Â 5 prospered, even without advertising.\n\nDuring the war years the directors of Parfums Chanel came up with an innovative marketing idea. Expanding sales to the middle-class customer had been started in 1934 with the introduction of the pocket \"flaÃ§on\". The plan was now to grow the market by selling the perfume at military post exchanges. It was a risky move that might have damaged the allure of the brand. It did not destroy the cachet of the brand; instead it became a souvenir the soldier coveted for his sweetheart back home.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Coco Chanel's wartime collaboration threatened her with arrest and incarceration. In an attempt at damage control, she placed a sign in the window of her rue Cambon boutique, announcing that free bottles of Chanel No.Â 5 were available to American GIs. Soldiers waited in long lines to take a bottle of Paris \"luxe\" back home, and \"would have been outraged if the French police had touched a hair on her head\".\n\nIn April 1952, Marilyn Monroe appears for the first time on the cover of \"Life\", and the article mentions her answer to the question, \"What do you wear to bed?\" and her reply, \"Chanel No.Â 5.\" In a photo shoot for an article by Sidney Skolsky in \"Modern Screen\" in 1953, a Chanel No.Â 5 bottle is seen on her nightstand.\n\nIn the 1960s the glossy fashion magazines such as \"Vogue\" and \"Bazaar\" presented Chanel No. 5 as a required accessory. Print advertising for Chanel No.Â 5 was staid and conservative in both visuals and text, eschewing the energy and quirky aesthetic of the youth culture. Two catch phrases alternated as ad copy: \"Every woman alive \"wants\" Chanel No.Â 5\" and \"Every woman alive \"loves\" Chanel No.Â 5\".\n\nIn the 1970s the brand name needed revitalization. For the first time it ran the risk of being labeled as \"mass market\" and passÃ©. The fragrance was removed from drug stores and similar outlets. Outside advertising agencies were dropped. The rebranding was managed by Jacques Helleu, the artistic director for Parfums Chanel. Helleu chose French actress Catherine Deneuve as the new face of Chanel. Print ads showcased the iconic sculpture of the bottle. Television commercials were inventive mini-films with production values of surreal fantasy and seduction. Directed by Ridley Scott in the 1970s and 1980s, they \"played on the same visual imagery, with the same silhouette of the bottle\".\n\nIn the 1990s, more money was reportedly spent advertising Chanel No. 5 than was spent for the promotion of any other fragrance. Carole Bouquet was the face of Chanel No.Â 5 during this decade.\n\nIn 2003, actress Nicole Kidman was enlisted to represent the fragrance. Film director Baz Luhrmann, brought in to conceive and direct a new advertising campaign featuring her, described his concept for what he titled \"No. 5 the Film\" as \"a two-minute trailer ... for a film that has actually never been made, not about Chanel No.Â 5 but Chanel No.Â 5 is the touchstone\". The eventual commercial, produced in two-minute and 30-second versions, cost Â£18Â million, with Kidman paid US$3.7Â million for her work.\n\nIt has been estimated, as of 2011, that between US$20â25Â million was spent annually marketing Chanel No.Â 5.\n\nIn May 2012, the company announced that Brad Pitt would be the first male to advertise Chanel No. 5.\n\nIn 2013 Chanel ran an advertising campaign using a recorded interview with Marilyn Monroe in which she is asked about her use of Chanel No.Â 5. It featured Ed Feingersh's photograph of the actress splashing herself with a bottle of the perfume. \n\nIn October 2014, Luhrmann again collaborated with Chanel, creating a second advertising campaign for No.Â 5, this time starring Gisele BÃ¼ndchen and Michiel Huisman. Throughout the film, singer Lo-Fang performs his rendition of \"You're the One That I Want\".\n\nOn February 17, 2020, French actress Marion Cotillard was announced as the new face of Chanel No. 5.\n\nCoco Chanel had wanted to develop a distinctly modern fragrance for some time by early-1920. At this time, Chanel's lover was Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov of Russia, the murderer of Rasputin. The duke introduced her to Ernest Beaux on the French Riviera. Beaux was the master perfumer at A. Rallet and Company, where he had been employed since 1898. The company was the official perfumer to the Russian royal family, and \"the imperial palace at St. Petersburg was a famously perfumed court.\" The favorite scent of the Czarina Alexandra, composed specifically for her by Rallet in Moscow, had been an eau de cologne opulent with rose and jasmine named \"Rallet O-De-Kolon NÂ°1 Vesovoi\".\n\nIn 1912, Beaux created a men's cologne, \"Le Bouquet de Napoleon\", to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino, a decisive battle in the Napoleonic Wars. Its success inspired Beaux to create a feminine counterpart, whose starting point was the chemical composition of aldehydic multiflores in Houbigant's immensely popular fragrance, \"Quelques Fleurs\" (1912).\n\nHis experiments with the aldehydes in \"Quelques Fleurs\", resulted in a fragrance that he called \"Le Bouquet de Catherine\". He intended to use the scent to celebrate, in 1913, the 300th anniversary of the Romanoff dynasty. The debut of this new perfume was ill-timed commercially. World War I was approaching, and the czarina and the perfume's namesake, the Empress Catherine, had both been German-born. Timing and unfavorable associations, combined with \"Le Bouquet de Catherine\"'s hefty price tag, made it a commercial failure. An attempt to re-brand the perfume, as \"Rallet NÂ°1\" was unsuccessful, and the outbreak of World War I in 1914 effectively killed the product.\n\nBeaux, who had affiliated himself with the Allies and the White Russian army, had spent 1917â1919 as a lieutenant stationed far north, in the last arctic outpost of the continent, Arkangelsk, at Mudyug Island Prison where he interrogated Bolshevik prisoners. The polar ice, frigid seascape, and whiteness of the snowy terrain sparked his desire to capture the crisp fragrance of this landscape in a new perfume.\n\nBeaux perfected what was to become Chanel No. 5 over several months in the late summer and autumn of 1920. He worked from the rose and jasmine base of \"Rallet NÂ°1\", altering it to make it cleaner, more daring, reminiscent of the polar freshness he had experienced during his war years. He experimented with modern synthetics, adding his own invention \"Rose E.B.\" and notes derived from a new jasmine source, a commercial ingredient called Jasophore. The revamped, complex formula also increased the quantities of orris root, iris root, and natural musks.\n\nThe key was Beaux's use of aldehydes. Aldehydes are organic compounds of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. They are manipulated in the laboratory at crucial stages of chemical reaction whereby the process arrests and isolates the scent. When used creatively, aldehydes act as \"seasonings\", as aroma boosters. Beaux's student, Constantin Weriguine, said the aldehyde Beaux used had the clean note of the arctic, \"a melting winter note\". A laboratory assistant, mistaking a full strength mixture for a ten percent dilution, had jolted the compound with a quantity of aldehyde never before used. Beaux prepared ten glass vials for Chanel's assessment. Numbered 1â5 and 20â24, each group a variation of the compound. \"Number five. Yes,\" Chanel said later, \"that is what I was waiting for. A perfume like nothing else. A woman's perfume, with the scent of a woman.\"\n\nAccording to Chanel, the formula used to produce No. 5 has changed little since its creation, except for the necessary exclusion of natural civet and certain nitro-musks.\n\n"}

{"id": "1928433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928433", "title": "Mikhail Rodzianko", "text": "Mikhail Rodzianko\n\nMikhail Vladimirovich Rodzianko (; ; 21 February 1859, Yekaterinoslav Governorate â 24 January 1924, Beodra, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) was a Russian statesman of Ukrainian origin. Known for his colorful language and conservative politics, he was the State Councillor and chamberlain of the Imperial family, Chairman of the State Duma and one of the leaders of the February Revolution of 1917, during which headed the Provisional Committee of the State Duma. He was a key figure in the events that led to the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia on 15 March 1917.\n\nRodzianko was born in the village of Popasne. He came from an old and rich noble family of Ukrainian origin and was educated at the \"Corps des Pages\". From 1877 until 1882 he served in the Her Majesty's Regiment of the Cavalry of the Guard. In 1884 Rodzianko married Anna Nikolaevna Galitzine (1859-1929); the couple had three children. In 1885 he retired and lived on his estate in the Novgorod Oblast. He was appointed as \"Marshall of the Gentry\". Rozianko served as \"Kammerherr\" in 1899. In 1900 he was elected in Yekaterinoslav Governorate. From 1903 until 1905 he was editor of a newspaper, called \"Herald Katerynoslav zemstvos.\" In 1906 he was elected for the Zemstvo as \"Provincial Zemstvo Executive\".\n\nIn 1905 Rodzianko had been one of the founders and leaders of the Octobrist party. He became a deputy in the Third Duma (1907), vice-president in 1909 and was elected Chairman on 22 March 1911 after the resignation of Aleksandr Guchkov, who was hated by the court as a âYoung Turk.â He then continued as the Chairman of the Fourth Duma from 15 November 1912 until its dissolution on 6 October 1917 (before the October Revolution).\n\nRodzianko thought the meeting between Grigory Rasputin and Emperor Nicholas II \"marked the beginning of the decay of the Russian society and the loss of prestige of the throne and of the tsar himself.\" He gathered information on Rasputin and handed it to the Emperor. Rodzianko, who asked Rasputin to leave the capital, and Theofan of Poltava held Rasputin to be a Khlyst. \n\"The emperor took no account of the report which nevertheless proved undoubtedly that Rasputin was not the holy man he claimed to be.\"\n\nOn 21 February 1913, Rodzianko dismissed Rasputin from the Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan in Saint Petersburg shortly before the celebration of the tercentenary of Romanov rule over Russia. He had established himself in front of the seats which Rodzianko, after considerable difficulty, had secured for the Duma. According to Orlando Figes, \"the members were to be seated at the back, far behind the places reserved for the state councilors and senators. This, he complained to the master of ceremonies, was 'not following the dignity' of the parliament.\" Rasputin considered Rodzianko a personal enemy and denounced him as a \"fat cat\".\n\n\"Rodzianko told the Tsar in March 1913: 'A war will be joyfully welcomed and it will raise the government's prestige.'\" In April 1915, Rodzyanko visited to the Russian troops occupying Austrian Galicia. \n\nOn 11 August 1915, the day the Emperor announced he would take the Supreme Command from Grand Duke Nicholas, according to M. Nelipa, Rodzianko suffered a heart attack. Somehow Rodzianko participated in the creation of the Progressive Bloc.\n\nFor Rodzianko, Alexei Khvostov had broken his neck in combating the Rasputin clique and Prime Minister Boris StÃ¼rmer would become a dictator with full powers early in 1916.\n\nIn the Summer of 1916, there was another crisis in the government: Rodzianko proposed Alexander Protopopov to the Emperor and Protopopov hinted at Rodzianko as Premier and Foreign Minister. But after Protopopov had become Minister of the Interior and had expressed admiration for the ruling family, the Duma attacked him fiercely and called at once for his dismissal. Rodzianko demanded that the Empress be internally exiled to the Crimea until the end of the war. The Empress demanded in response that Rodzianko's court rank be taken from him; she referred to him in her letters as a scoundrel.\n\nZinaida Yusupova, Alexandra's sister Elisabeth, Grand Duchess Victoria, and the Emperor's own mother tried to influence the Emperor or his stubborn wife to remove Rasputin, but without success. Rodzianko told Nicholas the truth, after being urged by the Emperor's mother and sisters. To him, the Empress Alexandra clearly should not have been allowed to interfere in state affairs until the end of the war; she treated her husband as if he were a little boy, quite incapable of taking care of himself.\n\nOn 7 January 1917, Rodzianko told the Tsar in regard of his government, \"All the best men have been removed or have retired. There remain [only] those of ill repute.\"\n\nMikhail Rodzianko was one of the key politicians during the Russian February Revolution. On 26 February Rodzianko urged the Tsar to promulgate reforms in a telegram. \"Serious situation in the capital, where anarchy reigns. General discontent was increasing. In the streets, uninterrupted firing, and one part of the troops is firing on the other. It is necessary to nominate without delay a person possessing the confidence of the people and who would form a new Government. To wait is impossible.\" Nicholas refused to reply, instead he ordered the dissolution of the Duma and a military crackdown and in a conversation with Count Vladimir Freedericksz referred to Rodzianko, not very respectfully, as \"fat-bellied Rodzianko\". On 27 February he retired as Captain of the Guards. On 28 February he presided over the Provisional Committee of the State Duma and advised the local governments to stay calm. On 1 March the power came entirely in the hands of the Petrograd Soviet. On that day Rodzianko assured general Mikhail Alekseyev that the Duma leaders, rather than the Soviet ones, would form the new government in Petrograd. Rodzianko discussed the situation with General Nikolai Ruzsky, who had the Imperial train stopped in Pskov. Nicholas II had no other choice than to follow Rodzianko's advice. On 2 March 1917 a Russian Provisional Government was formed, which included members of the Social Revolutionary Party. Rodzianko appointed General Lavr Kornilov as head over the troops in Petrograd. In the evening Rodzianko led abdication talks with Tsar, to satisfy the crowds.\n\nEarly in the morning of 2 March (Old Style) or 15 March (New Style) the Tsar stepped down in favor of his son Alexei, (but announced in public the next day). As the tsesarevich suffered from an incurable disease, hemophilia B, his life expectations were short. Then Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia came into the picture as the new heir to the throne, but was regarded as unacceptable. With Prince Lvov, Alexander Kerensky and Pavel Miliukov Rodzianko visited Grand Duke Michael. The Grand Duke declined the crown after a long talk with Rodzianko. \n\nRodzianko remained prime minister just for a few days. He succeeded in publishing an order for the immediate return of the soldiers to their barracks and subordinate to their officers. To them Rodzianko was unacceptable as prime minister and Prince Georgi Lvov, a member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, became his successor.\n\nTogether with Aleksandr Guchkov he founded a liberal republican party in the Summer of 1917. After the October Revolution or shortly after the seizure of power by Lenin, he left Petrograd and moved to Rostov-on-Don and Crimea. Rodzianko supported Anton Denikin and Pyotr Wrangel but when it became clear the White Army had lost, he emigrated to Serbia in 1920. There he wrote his memoirs \"The Reign of Rasputin: an Empire's Collapse.\" According to Bernard Pares he died in great poverty. His remains were moved to the new cemetery in Belgrade.\n\n\n"}

In 1861 he settled down after the state examination as a general practitioner in Berlin. He participated as a surgeon in three military campaigns (1864, 1866, 1870/71).\n\nBased on observations in his long career as a surgeon, he postulated Wolff's law (original title 1892: The law of transformation of the bone), which describes the relationship between bone geometry and mechanical influences on bone. For this he was with leading scientists of his time in active contact. Karl Culmann (1821â1881), Wilhelm Roux (1850â1924), Christian Otto Mohr (1835â1918) and Albert Hoffa (1859â1907) gave him support for the interpretation and evaluation of its research. His work established the mechanism and thus physical factors in evolutionary biology. He saw his work as an extension of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin (1809â1882).\n\nHis work was one of the mile stones for orthopedics as a distinct discipline in medicine. Julius Wolff was the first professor of orthopedics at the CharitÃ© and the founder and director of the first Department of Orthopaedic Surgery in Berlin. His scientific work has to this day a significant impact on orthopedic surgery. His findings that adapted bone altered mechanical conditions found today in application of musculoskeletal research, orthopedics, trauma surgery, rehabilitation, mechano-and cell biology and tissue engineering.\n\nHe died on February 18, 1902 of a stroke.\n\n1860 De artificiali ossium productione in animalibus, Diss.

He then became a student of Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich, where he got his doctorate in 1910. The topic of his thesis, the physics of electrical currents in gas, set the theme for his lifeâs field of research. He then went to conduct postgraduate research, on the same topic, at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR) in Berlin. In 1915, he was also a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin. In 1918, he was called by Johannes Stark, Director of the Institute of Physics at the University of Greifswald, to be extraordinarius professor there. In 1921, Seeliger took the position of ordinarius professor for theoretical physics at the University. He became Director of the Institute of Physics in 1940, and was succeeded in 1955, by Walter Schallreuter, who had been a co-author with Seeliger on a physics textbook series.\n\nIn collaboration with Ernst Gehrcke at the PTR, Seeliger continued his research on electrical discharges in gases. In the spring of 1912, Gehrcke and Seeliger determined that light from cathode rays (electron beams) passing through gases, such as nitrogen and mercury vapor, became longer in wavelength, as the velocity of the cathode rays were slowed, i.e., becoming lower in energy. These results, through experiments in 1912 and 1913, were clarified and interpreted, by James Franck and Gustav Hertz, nephew of Heinrich Hertz; for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom, Franck and Hertz were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1925.\n\nIn 1946, Paul Schulz founded the \"Forschungsstelle fÃ¼r Gasentladungsphysik\" (Research Center for Gas Discharge Physics) under the Academy of Sciences. When Schulz left in 1949, Seeliger became director. In 1950, the center was renamed the \"Institut fÃ¼r Gasentladungsphysik\" (Institute for Gas Discharge Physics). In 1969, the institute was reassigned to the \"Zentralinstitut fÃ¼r Elektronenphysik\" (Central Institute of Electron Physics). On 31 December 1991 the Institut fÃ¼r Gasentladungsphysik was dissolved and reopened the next day as the \"Institut fÃ¼r Niedertemperatur-Plasmaphysik e.V.\" and became part of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1948, Seeliger was Rector of the University of Greifswald.\n\n\n"}

On 8 January 2007 he resigned the presidency of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to take up the position of Minister for Commerce in the interim cabinet of Commodore Frank Bainimarama.\n\nOn 22 May 2005, Waradi called for the deregulation of the telecommunication market, to allow the market to dictate prices.\n\nOn 18 May 2005, Waradi spoke out about the Fijian government's controversial proposal to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission, with the power to recommend amnesty for perpetrators of the coup d'Ã©tat that rocked Fiji in 2000, as well as compensation for its victims. Among the strident comments both for and against the proposal, Waradi took a moderate stance, supporting the principle of reconciliation, but considering that legislating to establish the commission was not the right way to achieve it. He called the proposed legislation a \"man-made law\" that would not work unless the economic disparity between the races (indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians) was rectified. He also said that moral values would be essential to the success of the reconciliation process.\n\nOnly by integrating indigenous Fijians into the economic life of the country, such as through joint ventures, equities, board memberships, employment, and investment, could the root cause of unrest and instability be addressed, he said. Economic reconciliation would have to come before social and political reconciliation.\n\nRather than proceed with the proposed legislation, Waradi said the government should declare a National Conscience Week as a time for individuals and society as a whole to examine their hearts to ascertain where the nation had gone wrong. This week of reflection should be followed, he said, by a roadmap to achieve true reconciliation, peace, and prosperity.\n\nWaradi also emphasized that without moral values, the reconciliation process would fail. \"\"No amount of legislation can guarantee lasting peace and stability if the people it is supposed to serve are not spiritually and emotionally prepared to live by them and where necessary defend them with their lives when it is breached,\"\" he said. \"\"Basic moral values must therefore first be internalised in the hearts and minds of its people before we can hope to enforce legislation reflecting these values. We cannot begin to observe man-made laws if we do not have any moral values to start off with in the first place.\"\" This followed his earlier call on 15 May for social institutions that mould young people, such as churches, to preach and follow moral values.\n\n"}

After being deserted for about 300 years, the town was reestablished near by King U-Thong of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. In 1817 the town centre was moved to the opposite bank of the Mae Klong River.\n\nThe district was one of the five original districts of Monthon Ratchaburi that were established in 1895 with Phraya Surinthararuchai (Thet Bunnag) as the first superintendent commissioner. At first the provincial administration was in Photharam District, but was moved to \"tambon\" Na Mueang in 1898.\n\nNeighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Photharam and Damnoen Saduak of Ratchaburi Province, Bang Khonthi of Samut Songkhram Province, Wat Phleng, Pak Tho, and Chom Bueng of Ratchaburi.\n\nThe main river of the district is the Mae Klong.\n\nHin Kong Subdistrict will be the site of a 1,400 MW gas-fired power plant operated by SET-listed Ratch Group PLC. Construction will commence in 2021. The first block of 700 MW will come online in 2024 and the second 700 MW block in 2025. The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) approved the plant, which will cost US$700 million (21.7 billion baht), in 2019. Ratch signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with state-run Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), which owns a 45% stake in Ratch.\n\nThe district is divided into 22 sub-districts (\"tambons\"), which are further subdivided into 187 villages (\"muban\"). The town (\"thesaban mueang\") Ratchaburi covers the complete \"tambon\" Na Mueang. The township (\"thesaban tambon\") Khao Ngu covers parts of \"tambons\" Chedi Hak and Ko Phlapphla. Lak Mueang covers Khok Mo, Phong Sawai, Huai Chinsi and all of Ang Thong. There are a further 18 tambon administrative organizations (TAO).\nSince at least 2001, villagers of tambon Nam Pu have complained about toxic wastewater from an industrial waste treatment plant they suspected of contaminating their water. Wax Garbage Recycle Centre, an industrial waste treatment plant, began its operation in the upstream area of Nam Pu Creek about the same time as contamination became evident. The pollution spread to tambon Rang Bua of Chom Bueng District. Responding to complaints, the Thai Pollution Control Department tested creek water and groundwater. It found that levels of heavy metals (lead, nickel, and barium) exceeded their standards. They also found high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, benzene, 1,1,2-trichloromethane and Cis-1,2-dichloroethylene. The Department of Industrial Works and Ratchaburi's Industry Office, since 2002, have sent 19 letters ordering the plant to improve its operation, and at least six orders for the plant to shut down parts of its facility. Despite efforts by the authorities, the plant is still in operation and toxic wastewater contamination continues unabated.\n"}
{"id": "1928465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928465", "title": "Flavour (particle physics)", "text": "Flavour (particle physics)\n\nIn particle physics, flavour or flavor refers to the \"species\" of an elementary particle. The Standard Model counts six flavours of quarks and six flavours of leptons. They are conventionally parameterized with \"flavour quantum numbers\" that are assigned to all subatomic particles. They can also be described by some of the family symmetries proposed for the quark-lepton generations.\n\nIn classical mechanics, a force acting on a point-like particle can only alter the particle's dynamical state, i.e., its momentum, angular momentum, etc. Quantum field theory, however, allows interactions that can alter other facets of a particle's nature described by non dynamical, discrete quantum numbers. In particular, the action of the weak force is such that it allows the conversion of quantum numbers describing mass and electric charge of both quarks and leptons from one discrete type to another. This is known as a flavour change, or flavour transmutation. Due to their quantum description, flavour states may also undergo quantum superposition.\n\nIn atomic physics the principal quantum number of an electron specifies the electron shell in which it resides, which determines the energy level of the whole atom. Analogously, the five flavour quantum numbers (isospin, strangeness, charm, bottomness or topness) can characterize the quantum state of quarks, by the degree to which it exhibits six distinct flavours (u, d, s, c, b, t).\n\nComposite particles can be created from multiple quarks, forming hadrons, such as mesons and baryons, each possessing unique aggregate characteristics, such as different masses, electric charges, and decay modes. A hadron's overall flavour quantum numbers depend on the numbers of constituent quarks of each particular flavour.\n\nAll of the various charges discussed above are conserved by the fact that the corresponding charge operators can be understood as \"generators of symmetries\" that commute with the Hamiltonian. Thus, the eigenvalues of the various charge operators are conserved.\n\nAbsolutely conserved flavour quantum numbers are:\n\nIn some theories, such as the grand unified theory, the individual baryon and lepton number conservation can be violated, if the difference between them () is conserved (see chiral anomaly). All other flavour quantum numbers are violated by the electroweak interactions. Strong interactions conserve all flavours.\n\nIf there are two or more particles which have identical interactions, then they may be interchanged without affecting the physics. Any (complex) linear combination of these two particles give the same physics, as long as the combinations are orthogonal, or perpendicular, to each other.\n\nIn other words, the theory possesses symmetry transformations such as formula_1, where and are the two fields (representing the various \"generations\" of leptons and quarks, see below), and is any unitary matrix with a unit determinant. Such matrices form a Lie group called SU(2) (see special unitary group). This is an example of flavour symmetry.\n\nIn quantum chromodynamics, flavour is a conserved global symmetry. In the electroweak theory, on the other hand, this symmetry is broken, and flavour changing processes exist, such as quark decay or neutrino oscillations.\n\nAll leptons carry a lepton number . In addition, leptons carry weak isospin, , which is â for the three charged leptons (i.e. electron, muon and tau) and + for the three associated neutrinos. Each doublet of a charged lepton and a neutrino consisting of opposite are said to constitute one generation of leptons. In addition, one defines a quantum number called weak hypercharge, , which is â1 for all left-handed leptons. Weak isospin and weak hypercharge are gauged in the Standard Model.\n\nLeptons may be assigned the six flavour quantum numbers: electron number, muon number, tau number, and corresponding numbers for the neutrinos. These are conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions, but violated by weak interactions. Therefore, such flavour quantum numbers are not of great use. A separate quantum number for each generation is more useful: electronic lepton number (+1 for electrons and electron neutrinos), muonic lepton number (+1 for muons and muon neutrinos), and tauonic lepton number (+1 for tau leptons and tau neutrinos). However, even these numbers are not absolutely conserved, as neutrinos of different generations can mix; that is, a neutrino of one flavour can transform into another flavour. The strength of such mixings is specified by a matrix called the PontecorvoâMakiâNakagawaâSakata matrix (PMNS matrix).\n\nAll quarks carry a baryon number . They also all carry weak isospin, . The positive- quarks (up, charm, and top quarks) are called \"up-type quarks\" and negative- quarks (down, strange, and bottom quarks) are called \"down-type quarks\". Each doublet of up and down type quarks constitutes one generation of quarks.\n\nFor all the quark flavour quantum numbers listed below, the convention is that the flavour charge and the electric charge of a quark have the same sign. Thus any flavour carried by a charged meson has the same sign as its charge. Quarks have the following flavour quantum numbers: \n\nThese five quantum numbers, together with baryon number (which is not a flavour quantum number), completely specify numbers of all 6 quark flavours separately (as , i.e. an antiquark is counted with the minus sign). They are conserved by both the electromagnetic and strong interactions (but not the weak interaction). From them can be built the derived quantum numbers:\n\nThe terms \"strange\" and \"strangeness\" predate the discovery of the quark, but continued to be used after its discovery for the sake of continuity (i.e. the strangeness of each type of hadron remained the same); strangeness of anti-particles being referred to as +1, and particles as â1 as per the original definition. Strangeness was introduced to explain the rate of decay of newly discovered particles, such as the kaon, and was used in the Eightfold Way classification of hadrons and in subsequent quark models. These quantum numbers are preserved under strong and electromagnetic interactions, but not under weak interactions.\n\nFor first-order weak decays, that is processes involving only one quark decay, these quantum numbers (e.g. charm) can only vary by 1, that is, for a decay involving a charmed quark or antiquark either as the incident particle or as a decay byproduct, ; likewise, for a decay involving a bottom quark or antiquark . Since first-order processes are more common than second-order processes (involving two quark decays), this can be used as an approximate \"selection rule\" for weak decays.\n\nA special mixture of quark flavours is an eigenstate of the weak interaction part of the Hamiltonian, so will interact in a particularly simple way with the W bosons (charged weak interactions violate flavour). On the other hand, a fermion of a fixed mass (an eigenstate of the kinetic and strong interaction parts of the Hamiltonian) is an eigenstate of flavour. The transformation from the former basis to the flavour-eigenstate/mass-eigenstate basis for quarks underlies the CabibboâKobayashiâMaskawa matrix (CKM matrix). This matrix is analogous to the PMNS matrix for neutrinos, and quantifies flavour changes under charged weak interactions of quarks.\n\nThe CKM matrix allows for CP violation if there are at least three generations.\n\nFlavour quantum numbers are additive. Hence antiparticles have flavour equal in magnitude to the particle but opposite in sign. Hadrons inherit their flavour quantum number from their valence quarks: this is the basis of the classification in the quark model. The relations between the hypercharge, electric charge and other flavour quantum numbers hold for hadrons as well as quarks.\n\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) contains six flavours of quarks. However, their masses differ and as a result they are not strictly interchangeable with each other. The up and down flavours are close to having equal masses, and the theory of these two quarks possesses an approximate SU(2) symmetry (isospin symmetry).\n\nUnder some circumstances (for instance when the quark masses are much smaller than the chiral symmetry breaking scale of 250MeV), the masses of quarks do not meaningfully contribute to the system's behavior, and can be ignored to zeroth approximation. The simplified behavior of flavour transformations can then be successfully modeled as acting independently on the left- and right-handed parts of each quark field. This approximate description of the flavour symmetry is described by a chiral group .\n\nIf all quarks had non-zero but equal masses, then this chiral symmetry is broken to the \"vector symmetry\" of the \"diagonal flavour group\" , which applies the same transformation to both helicities of the quarks. This reduction of symmetry is a form of \"explicit symmetry breaking\". The strength of explicit symmetry breaking is controlled by the current quark masses in QCD.\n\nEven if quarks are massless, chiral flavour symmetry can be spontaneously broken if the vacuum of the theory contains a chiral condensate (as it does in low-energy QCD). This gives rise to an effective mass for the quarks, often identified with the valence quark mass in QCD.\n\nAnalysis of experiments indicate that the current quark masses of the lighter flavours of quarks are much smaller than the QCD scale, Î, hence chiral flavour symmetry is a good approximation to QCD for the up, down and strange quarks. The success of chiral perturbation theory and the even more naive chiral models spring from this fact. The valence quark masses extracted from the quark model are much larger than the current quark mass. This indicates that QCD has spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking with the formation of a chiral condensate. Other phases of QCD may break the chiral flavour symmetries in other ways.\n\nSome of the historical events that led to the development of flavour symmetry are discussed in the article on isospin, the eightfold way (physics) and chiral symmetry.\n\n\n\n"}

Students take a 6-year course, with the IGCSE in the fourth year and the International Baccalaureate in the sixth year. Before 2007, students took the International A-Levels. The school opened its doors on January 2005 with 150 students of 20 different nationalities, located in Holland Village on the former premises of the now defunct Buona Vista Secondary School at 61 Jalan Hitam Manis. The current principal is Mr. Rob Burrough. The school need not seek permission from the Ministry of Education of admitting Singaporean students as it follows several of the Ministry's policies such as the MOE's bilingual policy and observe practices like singing the National Anthem, while the school runs its own programme. On 12 April 2004, the school was approved as one of the two proposals submitted among five proposals. The school was approved based on the strength of the management team, range of curriculum offerings, and the quality of education they could provide to the students.\n\nThe school offers a six-year secondary and pre-university programme where they take the Cambridge IGCSE (examined by University of Cambridge International Examinations) in their fourth year and the IB Diploma Programme in the sixth year. Those need to improve their English proficiency or foundation knowledge related to courses would be recommended to take a bridging programme for around six months to a year where they will be taught English, mathematics, science, music, visual arts and a humanities subject. Students in the bridging programme would have separate form classes from the mainstream students. All Singaporean students are required to take their mother tongue as per requirements from the Ministry of Education, unless exempted. International students have to take a second language of their choice and are obliged to do so at IB level as part of the IB Diploma Programme.\n\nIn Years 1 and 2, students follow a general programme where they study English, a second language (Singaporeans take their mother tongue unless exempted), science, history, geography, religious education, visual arts, music, and physical education. They sit for an internal end of year examinations for all their subjects with the exception of physical education and would be promoted if they have met the minimum criteria. Science is divided into three modules, namely biology, physics and chemistry which would be for a term for each module at minimum with the last term for revision. History and geography are taken for a period of six months and will eventually have a changeover at the end of six months.\n\nFor students in Years 3 and 4, they will be able to select their subjects and take them at IGCSE level and at Singaporean GCE 'O' Level for mother tongue subjects. They have to take a minimum of six subjects and a maximum of ten but most students usually do eight subjects at IGCSE including second language. All students have to take English as a first language or as a second language, as well as English literature (in the case of students taking English as a first language). It is compulsory to take a second language where all Singaporean students have to take their mother tongue either at Express, Higher or Language 'B' level (Chinese, Malay and Tamil) unless exempted in which they have to take the language at Mother Tongue 'B' Level or another language at IGCSE level. All other students would then take a second language at IGCSE level in French, Chinese, German, Spanish, Japanese, Hindi, Malay. All students take at least one science subject either biology, chemistry or physics and have the option to do two or all three sciences. Also, they have to take mathematics and a humanities subject where they can opt to do economics, business studies, history, geography, visual arts, music, and religious studies. Students with a stronger ability in mathematics are able to take Additional Mathematics at IGCSE level and those who do not wish to do additional science subjects are able to select one or two additional humanities subject.\n\nSenior students (Years 5 - 6) will take a two-year course leading to the IB Diploma Programme and have to take a total of six subjects together with the core i.e. Extended Essay, Theory of knowledge, and Creativity, Action, Service. Students take a subject each from all the six groups with three at standard level and three at higher level, although it is possible for students to take four at higher level and two at standard level. A Group 6 subject can be replaced with a subject from Group 2, Group 3 or Group 4. In the November 2009 examination session, three students managed to score 44 points out of a total of 45 points. In the November 2015 examination session, 1 student scored a perfect score of 45, making her the first perfect scorer in the school. Moreover, many graduates have been accepted into world-class universities such as University of Pennsylvania, Warwick University, National University of Singapore, Imperial College, Purdue University, and many others.\n\nIt boasts a wireless LAN system throughout the campus. The school also has a fully air-conditioned chapel, the Oldham Chapel, and state-of-the-art Science laboratories including two Life Science labs. It has a sports field and a tennis court. The school has a media resource library that contains around 7000 titles together with newspapers, periodicals, reference books and videos. Between science laboratories, there are small rooms called think-tanks. Think-tanks were built to accommodate student who want to study during their free periods. There are also four auditoriums on the upper two floors on the old building which has since been used as classrooms. It has a kitchen for lifeskills and art rooms. On the floor above the canteen, there are four music rooms. The administration office was once also used as a students lounge when the school was partially completed. There is a HOD room for the heads of department. The school also uses a homeroom system, by which students go to the teachers classrooms. All the classrooms have an average capacity of 25 students and are air conditioned.\n\nIn July 2006, the school announced its intention to construct a new three storey block which includes twenty classrooms on the site of the former basketball court. The new building, known as Foo Hee Lim Block, was named after the late Foo Hee Lim after the estate donated a considerable sum to the school. The building was completed in June 2007 with the English, Economics, and Business Studies classrooms housed in this new block.\n\nIn 2011, the school finished building the Lim Seng Guan sports hall and a five-storey Sports Block located over the canal. The Lim Seng Guan Hall is an indoor sports hall which includes a rock climbing wall and is used for assemblies and other school functions. The five-storey Sports Block houses the offices of the Holland Village Methodist Church, gym, sick bay, and additional classrooms. A basketball court was built next to it.\n\nThe school made a new addition to the campus in 2012. A three-storey block that later became six, this building has a storey each dedicated to the Arts and Drama classes with language classrooms on the third and fourth levels. The two-storey Sitorus Library is located in this block. The building was later named Darren Loh Block, but it is more well-known as the Library Block.\n\nACS (International)'s current student council is made up of thirteen councilors and they are from years 3, 4 and 5. They get elected to the student council annually through an election. Student councilors from year 5 must step down from the council in year 6 as they are sitting for their external examinations. The Student Council organises school activities such as Chinese New Year celebrations, Valentine's Day, Racial Harmony Day, National Day, Parties and graduations together with the school staff. There is a president and a vice president among the thirteen councilors. There are also council delegates from every level and they assist the student council and are part of the student council. The prefectorial board is made up of senior students of the school in which some of them are also serving as student councilors. They are appointed by the principal to serve a one-year term. The prefects take charge of doing morning assemblies, helping out at school functions, open houses as well as other events. Prefects have the rights to give warnings and detentions (after three warnings). Every class can elect up to two monitors which they are leaders and assist the teachers. Also, there are school ambassadors that represent the school at events and help out the school during school functions of which they are appointed by teachers.\n\nThe school uses eight houses of the ACS family, namely Oldham, Thoburn, Tan Kah Kee, Goh Hood Keng, Lee Seng Gee, Cheong Koon Seng, Tan Chin Tuan and Shaw Vee Meng. All students are assigned to a house for sporting and selected competitions in which they are divided into senior and junior teams. Each house appoints four captains of which two are from the junior team and two from the senior team (where there will be one girl and one boy selected from both teams). The house captains are considered to be student leaders and would therefore be installed at the annual student leaders investiture. Merits earned by students through good conduct, academic work, CCA, helpfulness would be added up to the total points of each house and therefore would be counted towards the House Challenge Shield which is presented to the school at its annual Speech Day.\n\nFor foreign students, boarding facilities are provided at Oldham Hall at the ACS Barker Road Campus and ACS Independent Boarding School.\n\n\n"}

Gehrcke (1 July 1878 in Berlin â 25 January 1960 in Hohen-Neuendorf) was a German experimental physicist. He was director of the optical department at the Reich Physical and Technical Institute. Concurrently, he was a professor at the University of Berlin. He developed the LummerâGehrcke method in interferometry, he discovered anode rays, and he developed the multiplex interferometric spectroscope for precision resolution of spectral-line structures. As an anti-relativist, he was a speaker at an event organized in 1920 by the Working Society of German Scientists. He sat on the board of trustees of the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory. After World War II, he worked at Carl Zeiss Jena, and he helped to develop and become the director of the Institute for Physiological Optics at the University of Jena. In 1949, he began work at the German Office for Materials and Product Testing. In 1953, he became the director of the optical department of the German Office for Weights and Measures.\n\nGehrcke studied at the \"Friedrich-Wilhelms-UniversitÃ¤t\" (today, the \"Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin\") from 1897 to 1901. He received his doctorate under Emil Warburg in 1901.\n\nIn 1901, Gehrcke joined the \"Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt\" (PTR, Reich Physical and Technical Institute, after 1945 renamed the \"Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt\"). In 1926, he became the director of the optical department, a position he held until 1946. Concurrent with his position at the PTR, he was a \"Privatdozent\" at the \"Friedrich-Wilhelms-UniversitÃ¤t\" from 1904 to 1921 and an \"auÃerordentlicher Professor\" (extraordinarius professor) from 1921 to 1946. After the close of World War II, the University was in the Russian sector of Berlin.\n\nIn 1946, Gehrcke worked at \"Carl Zeiss AG\" in Jena, and he helped to develop and become the director of the Institute for Physiological Optics at the \"Friedrich-Schiller-UniversitÃ¤t Jena\". In 1949, he went to East Berlin to the \"Deutsches Amt fÃ¼r MaterialprÃ¼fung\" (German Office for Materials and Product Testing). In 1953, he became the director of the optical department of the \"Deutsches Amt fÃ¼r MaÃ und Gewicht\" (DAMG, German Office for Weights and Measures) in East Berlin, the East German equivalent to the West German \"Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt\" (Federal Physical and Technical Institute).\n\nGehrcke contributed to the experimental techniques of interference spectroscopy (interferometry), physiological optics, and the physics of electrical discharges in gases. In 1903, with Otto Lummer, he developed the LummerâGehrcke method in interferometry. In 1908, with O. Reichenheim, he discovered anode rays. In 1927, with Ernst Gustav Lau, he developed the multiplex interferometric spectroscope for precision resolution of spectral-line structures.\n\nLike a number of other prominent physicists of the time (including the leading Dutch theoretician H. A. Lorentz) Gehrcke, an experimentalist, was not prepared to give up the concept of the luminiferous aether, and for this and various other reasons had been highly critical of Einstein's theories of relativity at least since 1911. This led to an invitation to an event organized in 1920 by Paul Weyland. Weyland, a radical political activist, professional agitator, small-time criminal, and editor of the vehemently anti-Semitic periodical \"VÃ¶lkische Monatshefte\", believed that Einstein's theories had been excessively promoted in the Berlin press, which he imagined was dominated by Jews who were sympathetic to Einstein's cause for other than scientific reasons. In response, Weyland organized the \"Arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher Naturforscher zur Erhaltung reiner Wissenschaft\" (Working Group of German Natural Scientists for the Preservation of Pure Science), which was never officially registered. Weyland tried to enlist the support of some prominent conservative scientists, such as the Nobel Laureate Philipp Lenard, to build support for the Society (although Lenard declined to participate in Weyland's meetings). The Society held its first and only event on 24 August 1920, featuring lectures against Albert Einsteinâs theory of relativity. Weyland gave the first presentation in which he accused Einstein of being a plagiarizer. Gehrcke gave the second and last talks, in which he presented detailed criticisms of Einstein's theories. Einstein attended the event with Walther Nernst. Max von Laue, Walther Nernst, and Heinrich Rubens published a brief and dignified response to the event, in the leading Berlin daily \"TÃ¤gliche Rundschau\", on 26 August. Einstein published his own somewhat lengthy reply on 27 August, which he later came to regret. Rising anti-Semitism and antipathy to recent trends in theoretical physics (especially with respect to the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics) were key motivational factors for the \"Deutsche Physik\" movement.\n\nUnder advice from some of his closest associates, Einstein later publicly challenged his critics to debate him in a more professional environment, and several of his scientific adversaries, including Gehrcke and Lenard, accepted. The ensuing debate took place at the 86th meeting of the German Society of Scientists and Physicians in Bad Nauheim on 20 September, chaired by Friedrich von MÃ¼ller, with Hendrik Lorentz, Max Planck, and Hermann Weyl present. In this meeting Gehrcke pressed his criticism that Einstein's general theory of relativity now admitted superluminal velocities in rotating frames of reference, which the special theory of relativity had ruled out (see Criticism of the theory of relativity).\n\nThe physics Nobel Laureate Philipp Lenard suggested Gehrcke for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1925, Gehrcke was also a member of the \"Kuratorium\" (board of trustees) of the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory. On 9 February 1922, Max Planck nominated Gehrcke, Max von Laue, G. MÃ¼ller, Walther Nernst to sit on the \"Kuratorium\", and they were installed by the \"PreuÃische Akademie der Wissenschaften\" (Prussian Academy of Sciences). Gehrcke represented the \"Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt\". During their appointment, they sat four times with Albert Einstein present. This was a surprising collaboration in view of what had happened just 18 months earlier at the gathering under the auspices of the \"Arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher Naturforscher\" and the responses in the press by Einstein, Laue, and Nernst.\n\nGehrcke was a member of professional organizations, which included:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is housed in a former airship hangar (known as the Aerium), the biggest free-standing hall in the world. The hall belonged to the company Cargolifter until its insolvency in 2002.\n\nTropical Islands has a maximum capacity of 8,200 visitors a day. In its first year of operation it attracted 975,000 visitors, according to the operators. The Tanjong company reported 155,000 visitors in the business year February 2004 to February 2005. Approximately 600 people work at Tropical Islands.\n\nTropical Islands has a world record for the largest indoor waterpark. It is bigger than Canada's World Waterpark at West Edmonton Mall. It is also the fourth-largest building in the world by usable volume.\n\nParques Reunidos acquired Tropical Islands in December 2018. \n\nTropical Islands is located approximately 60 kilometres south of the centre of Berlin and 50 kilometres from the southern boundary of the city. It is close to Briesen/Brand in the south of the municipality of Halbe. The theme park is on the site of the former Soviet airfield Brand, in the Aerium hangar.\n\nIt can be reached by taking the A13 autobahn. It can also be reached taking a train to Brand Tropical Islands, followed by a free shuttle bus.\n\nIn 1938, Germany began development of Brand-Briesen Airfield for the Luftwaffe. The Red Army overran the site in May 1945, and occupied the site after World War II, adding a second runway and nuclear-resistant command and control facilities for the fighter aircraft regiment.\n\nWith the reunification of Germany in 1989/1990, the Soviet Army agreed to return all military bases by 1994. Returned to the Federal Government of Germany in 1992, Cargolifter AG bought the former military airfield to construct airships. It began development of a new construction hall, 360 metres long, 210 metres wide and 107 metres high, which cost â¬78 million. At 5.5 million mÂ³ (194 million ftÂ³), it is one of the largest buildings on Earth by volume, and is the world's largest single hall without supporting pillars inside. The hangar was commissioned as an airship hangar named \"Aerium\" in November 2000, but the airship it was intended to house â the CL160 â was never built. CargoLifter went bankrupt in mid-2002.\n\nTropical Islands was built by the Malaysian corporation Tanjong in the former airship hangar known as the Aerium.\nThe hangar â the third largest free-standing hall in the world â was originally designed to protect large airships from the elements. It was purchased by Tanjong on 11 June 2003 for â¬17.5 million, of which â¬10 million was a subsidy from the federal state of Brandenburg. The building permit for constructing the theme park inside the hall was granted on 2 February 2004 and Tropical Islands officially opened on 19 December 2004.\n\nInside the hall, the air temperature is 26 Â°C (78Â°F) and air humidity is around 64%. Tropical Islands is home to the biggest indoor rainforest in the world, a beach, many tropical plants and a number of swimming pools, bars and restaurants. It is open around the clock, every day of the year â except on Christmas Eve .\n\nOn entering the hall, visitors choose between different basic admission options with different prices. Tropical Islands is divided into two main areas, each with its own admission price. Visitors can move from one area to the other by paying an additional daily charge. Additional charges also apply for areas such as the water slide tower (not always), crazy golf course, African Jungle Lift, evening show and internal accommodation area. The entertainment programme comprises a gala evening show, smaller shows during the day and various events.\n\nTropical Islands has a number of different themed areas:\n\nA 4,000 mÂ² children's play area opened in 2007. In mid-2007, a sauna and spa facility with six separate areas was added, the largest tropical sauna complex in Europe. The design of the saunas is inspired by UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South-East Asia, including a cave temple on Elephanta Island in India and the Angkor Wat temple in Cambodia. The bathing area includes a 27-metre high water slide tower with four slides, a children's play area and a crazy golf course.\n\nAccording to figures published by the company, Tropical Islands has spent EUR 23 million on further development and expansion work. The original total investment sum announced was EUR 75 million, including a EUR 17 million subsidy from the federal state of Brandenburg. The purpose of the subsidy for the development work was to preserve the 501 jobs.\n\nIn 2008, a campsite was added close to the Tropical Islands hall.\n\nAt first, visitor numbers remained behind original estimates. For a cost-effective operation, 1.25 million visitors per year are required. In 2005, the resort lost between 10 and 20 million euros. By October 2006 there were about 600,000 visitors. The initial lack of visitors has been attributed to various reasons, including the relatively remote location of Tropical Islands. In addition, in Berlin, South Brandenburg, the direct surrounding area of the resort, the disposable income is below the national average. The target demographic of the resort was extended to attract visitors from further away, including Poland.\n\nBy altering the ticket price structure and adding new overnight accommodation, visitors attendance has been improved. According to the then managing director Ole Bested Hensing, 2008 was the first time Tropical Islands Resort made a profit. It recorded 300,000 overnight stays.\n\nAt the start there were problems with the plants that were under the light-tight dome. In October 2005, the southern front along the \"South Sea\" bathing area had a special UV-transparent film made of ETFE installed. This 20,000 square metre \"window\" allows daylight. The palms, trees and bushes have grown well since.\n\n\n"}

Lord Palmerston, then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, introduced a bill for the transfer of control of the Government of India from the East India Company to the Crown, referring to the grave defects in the existing system of the government of India. However, before this bill was to be passed, Palmerston was forced to resign on another issue.\nLater Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby (who would later become the first Secretary of State for India), introduced another bill which was originally titled as \"An Act for the Better Government of India\" and it was passed on 2 August 1858. This act provided that India was to be governed directly and in the name of the Crown.\n\nThe Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced the British Government to pass the Act. The Act was followed a few months later by Queen Victoria's proclamation to the \"Princes, Chiefs, and People of India\", which, among other things, stated, \"We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligation of duty which bind us to all our other subjects.\" (p.Â 2)\n\n\nThe Act ushered in a new period of Indian history, bringing about the end of Company rule in India.

As of 2018, he tours alongside Jeremy Clyde of Chad and Jeremy in a new duo entitled Peter and Jeremy, where they perform hits from both of their respective catalogues. In 2019, Asher published a book \"The Beatles from A to Zed\" about his personal reminiscences about the band.\n\nAsher was born at the Central Middlesex Hospital to Richard and Margaret Asher, \"nÃ©e\" Eliot. His father was a consultant in blood and mental diseases at the Central Middlesex Hospital, as well as being a broadcaster and the author of notable medical articles.

Through this connection, Asher and Waller were often given unrecorded Lennon-McCartney songs to perform.\n\nAsher later read philosophy at King's College London. \n\nIn 1965, he was best man when singer Marianne Faithfull married John Dunbar in Cambridge.\n\nAfter Peter and Gordon disbanded in 1968, Asher took charge of the A&R department at the Beatles' Apple Records label, where he signed a then-unknown James Taylor and agreed to produce the singer-songwriter's debut solo album. The album was not a success, but Asher was so convinced that Taylor held great potential that he resigned his post at Apple to move to the United States and work as Taylor's manager. Asher produced Paul Jones' rendition of the Bee Gees' \"And the Sun Will Shine\" which was released as a single (only in the UK). He also produced a number of Taylor's recordings from 1970 to 1985, including \"Sweet Baby James, Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon, JT\" and \"Flag\".\n\nIn the early 1970s, Asher also managed the country rock band, Country, which recorded for Atlantic Records through its subsidiary Clean Records, featuring Michael Fondiler and Tom Snow, who has since become a songwriter. For a time, Asher also managed James Taylor's sister Kate Taylor. When she decided to leave the business, she recommended him to Linda Ronstadt at which point Asher became Ronstadt's manager. Asher achieved his greatest success producing a long string of multi-platinum albums for James Taylor, including \"Sweet Baby James\", \"JT\" and \"Flag\", and for Linda Ronstadt, including \"Heart Like a Wheel\", \"Simple Dreams\", \"Living in the USA\", \"What's New\", \"Canciones De Mi Padre\" and \"Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind\".\n\nThe Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood was opened on 23 September 1973 by Elmer Valentine and Lou Adler along with original partners David Geffen, Elliot Roberts and Peter Asher.\n\nAsher also played a role in shaping the Californian rock sound prominent during the 1970s, producing records for Ronstadt, J. D. Souther, Andrew Gold and Bonnie Raitt. In 1976, Asher and Waller reformed for the annual New York \"Beatlefest\" and played a few other dates. In the 1980s, Asher also worked on hit albums for artists as diverse as Cher and 10,000 Maniacs.\n\nIn February 1995, Asher was named Senior Vice-President, Sony Music Entertainment. At the beginning of 2002, Asher left Sony and returned full-time to the management of artists' careers as co-President of Sanctuary Artist Management. In January 2005 he was named President, the position he held until September 2006, when he resigned. In 2007 Asher joined forces with his friend Simon Renshaw (who manages the Dixie Chicks) at the company Simon founded, Strategic Artist Management. Strategic has grown into a dominant force in the entertainment industry, now managing artists in many fields of endeavour beyond just music â one of Asher's clients is Pamela Anderson. Asher also reunited with James Taylor as the producer of the \"Live at the Troubadour\" reunion album recorded in 2007, with Carole King and Taylor's original band.\n\nDuring 2005 and 2006, Peter and Gordon reformed for occasional concerts. However, Waller died in 2009 and in its obituary, \"The Times\" observed that \"Waller was thought more handsome than the slightly nerdish looking Asher\".\n\nAsher had been quoted as saying that actor Mike Myers has said he had patterned his Austin Powers character after Asher's appearance, although Elizabeth Hurley, who co-starred in \"Austin Powers\", claimed that the original model was broadcaster Simon Dee.\n\nIn 2011, Asher was the executive producer of the \"\" compilation album and also music supervisor, producer, and co-host of the \"\" PBS Pledge Special. Performed and filmed in front of a live audience the Buddy Holly tribute concert aired as PBS Pledge Special in December 2011 and May and June 2012. The Special received the highest 2012 Silver Telly Award in the Category of TV Programs, Segments, or Promotional Pieces.\n\nAsher was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to the British music industry.\n\nIn May 2017, Asher debuted a weekly, hour-long series on the brand-new Sirius XM Radio station for The Beatles called \"From Me To You\". He also announced with commentary the Top 100 Beatles countdown \"All Together Now\" on The Beatles Channel that first aired on Sirius XM Radio on the Labor Day Weekend in 2017, and is frequently replayed.\n\nSince 2016, Peter Asher has been playing shows, including one at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival, as part of a duo with Albert Lee that showcases songs from both their careers. He currently resides in Venice, California.\n\nIn 2018, Asher began performing with Jeremy Clyde of Chad & Jeremy fame.\n\nAsher had a short-lived relationship with singer Millie Small, also known as Millie, who sang \"My Boy Lollipop\".\n\nHe was married twice, first to Betsy Doster. In 1983, he married his second wife, Wendy Worth. Their daughter, Victoria Asher, was born in 1984. She was the keytarist in the American synthpop/pop punk band, Cobra Starship.\n\n\nAll releases by Peter and Gordon unless noted.\n"}

This service was based on the development of a heavy lift airship, the CL160, a vessel designed to carry a payload. The airship was never built and the company went bankrupt in July 2002. Today the shareholder-founded \"CL CargoLifter GmbH & Co. KG\" company seeks to continue selling the lighter-than-air technology.\n\nCargolifter AG was created on 1 September 1996 in Wiesbaden, Germany. A public stock offering took place in May 2000, and the resulting shareholder structure was characterized by a high proportion of small investors, attracted by substantial press coverage of the new breakthrough technologies being promised.\n\nThe hangar for production and operation of the CL160 and engineering team facilities were built on the former Soviet Air Force base at Brand-Briesen Airfield, acquired to enable development and operations. The hangar ( long, wide and high), a technological marvel in itself, is a freestanding steel-dome \"barrel-bowl\" construction large enough to fit the Eiffel Tower on its side. The hangar was also equipped with a cutting table to manufacture the airship's envelope. After the company bankrupted, a tropical theme park was opened there.\n\nThe first CL 160 airship was never built, though a considerable amount of design and development work was undertaken. The technical complexity (something akin to designing an airliner with less vetted technology) along with limited funding (a fraction of the funding typically available for the development of new airliners), and short development timeline meant that program challenges were underestimated, making the project relatively risky.\n\nA small manned prototype named 'Joey' was built in order to test project concepts on a reduced scale. Another aircraft, the \"CL 75 Aircrane\" transportation balloon prototype, of similar size (61 m in diameter) and height (87 m) to the CL 160, was built but destroyed in a storm in July 2002. Despite the setback, an agreement was reached with Boeing in 2002 for the joint study of a lighter-than-air stratospheric platform.\n\nThe prototype, filled with 110,000 m of helium, was taken out of the hangar for the first time in October 2001. It represented a new stage in full-scale experimental purposes. The loadframe of this unit was engineered by American company AdvanTek International LLC, on behalf of Cargolifter AG. The sale of one CL 75 Aircrane along with 25 options (at a unit price of US$10 million), was later planned to the Canadian company Heavy Elevator Canada Inc., a deal with which CargoLifter AG was at least 20% involved. The contract never became effective.\n\nOn 7 June 2002 the company announced insolvency, and liquidation proceedings began the following month. The fate of parts of the 300 million euros in shareholder funds from over 70,000 investors is still unclear.\n\nIn June 2003, the company's facilities were sold off for less than 20% of the construction costs. The airship hangar was converted to a 'tropical paradise'-themed indoor holiday resort called Tropical Islands, which opened in 2004.\n\nThe Skyship airship, which had been purchased by Cargolifter for training and research purposes, was sold to Swiss Skycruise and used in Athens for flights connected with the Olympic games held there.\n\nToday, the \"CL CargoLifter GmbH & Co. KG\" company, founded by former Cargolifter AG shareholders, seeks to sell the lighter-than-air technology and is exploring the construction of smaller airships.\n\n\n"}

It has a full-time staff of about 60 employees in Horn Lake, plus about 160 tournament directors throughout the country. The headquarters also houses the League's Museum, Library and League's Hall of Fame.\n\nThree times a year, in the spring, summer, and fall, the ACBL holds the North American Bridge Championships (NABC) using the duplicate bridge method of scoring, which greatly reduces the element of luck in competition. The NABC typically extends over eleven days and includes many different events. The location of the NABC is rotated among major cities, attended by thousands of players. The 2009 Summer Nationals in Washington, DC had 14,115 total tables played over the 11 days.\n\nFor many, the most significant role of the ACBL is its sanctioning of club games and tournaments to award masterpoints. If an event has the ACBL sanction, then the highest-finishing players are awarded specified numbers of masterpoints, which can be recorded with the ACBL. Most players value the increase in their masterpoint total as a measure of their success at the game. Unlike the Elo rating system developed for chess, the masterpoint system is strictly one of accumulation. A player's masterpoint total can never decline except as part of a penalty imposed for ethics violations.\n\nMembers receive the monthly \"Bridge Bulletin\" magazine.\n\nIn addition to the \"Laws of Duplicate Bridge\" (named \"Laws of Duplicate Contract Bridge\" until 2008), the ACBL offers many other training and information resources at its official website including software supporting education and play of the game,\n\nThe ACBL has also published the \"ACBL Bridge Series\", a series of books written by Audrey Grant and designed to teach the game to beginners, as well as to help more experienced players review and expand upon their knowledge of the game.\n\nThe ACBL consists of 25 Districts.

The Mon communities have maintained some of their traditions and have built their own Buddhist temples.\nLater the town attracted numerous Chinese immigrants. Also many Lao Wiang communities settled in the Nong Kop subdistrict of rural Ban Pong.\n\nDuring the Japanese-directed construction of the Burma Railway in World War II Ban Pong was the site of one of the Japanese POW camps, Nong Pladuk, where numerous British and Allied troops were held. \n\nTwo great fires occurred in Ban Pong, razing the town centre: one in 1936 and the other in 1954. The town was rebuilt in the square-grid design then fashionable, with a fountain to the south and a clock tower to the north.\n\nBan Pong is a railway hub, where the western railway leading to Kanchanaburi (and further to Nam Tok) splits from the southern railway leading to Singapore. Another branch connects with the town Suphanburi to the north. \n\nAs a result of high investment and fast economic development in the past decades, the town stands as one with the highest GDP per capita in western Thailand, well above national average. It is also experiencing de-industrialisation of labour-intensive industries such as canning and sugar refining. There is a large abandoned canning factory in Ban Pong town. The town is now experiencing a boom in more highly skilled industries such as auto parts, petrochemical, and food industries, with more than 70 percent of Thai buses and coaches manufactured in Ban Pong. The biggest paper making complex in Thailand lies north of the town.\n\nAs of June 2014, the National Statistics Bureau reported Ban Pong's annual GDP per capita (nominal) at US$9,623 and its annual GDP per capita (PPP) at US$24,000 compared with Thailand's US$5,675 and US$14,136 respectively.\n\nBan Pong is also the centre of a large pet market especially ornamental fish.

Founded in 1885 as Igirisu HÅritsu GakkÅ (the English Law School), Chuo is one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions in the country. The university operates four campuses in Tokyo: the largest in HachiÅji (Tama campus), one in BunkyÅ (Korakuen campus), and two others in Shinjuku (Ichigaya and Ichigaya-Tamachi campuses). Chuo is organized into six faculties, ten graduate schools, and nine research institutes. There are also four affiliated high schools and two affiliated junior high schools.\n\nChuo was founded as the in 1885 at Kanda in Tokyo by a group of lawyers. Before 1889, the school moved and was renamed to Tokyo College of Law (TÅkyÅ HÅgakuin). The curriculum was changed to reflect the government reform of Japanese law and creation of a new civil code. Opposition to the implementation of new civil code resulted in the government shuttering of the campus journal and the subsequent creation of the \"Chuo Law Review\" (HÅgaku ShinpÅ), which has been regularly published since then.\n\nThe university was burnt down in the Great Kanda Fire that occurred in 1892, but was able to hold temporary classes. Before 1903, the school was promoted to Tokyo University of Law (Tokyo HÅgakuin Daigaku) and in 1905, the school expanded itself with the department of economics and renamed itself Chuo University.\n\nThe origin of its name \"Chuo\" has not been certain. However, many founders of the university were once students of the Middle Temple, London, United Kingdom before they completed their training and became qualified as Barristers. This is one of the reasons why the university was renamed to \"Chuo\", which literally means middle, center or central.\n\nAnother fire torched the campus in June 1917, but it was rebuilt in August 1918.\n\nIn 1918, Japanese government enacted University Ordinance (Daigaku Rei) that set legal framework of universities except imperial universities established by Imperial University Ordinance. Under this University Ordinance, licensed universities were permitted to issue official degrees. Chuo University was successfully licensed in 1920 with three faculties (law, economics and commerce), graduate schools and preparatory schools.\n\nThe 1923 Great KantÅ earthquake again reduced the campus to rubble and it was rebuilt and relocated at Kanda-Surugadai in 1926.\n\nIn 1944, Engineering College was established.\n\nAfter World War II, Chuo University started a series of reformations along with a new School Education Act of 1947. In 1948, its Correspondence Division was annexed to its Faculty of Law. In 1949, a new university system under the School Education Act of 1947 was applied to Chuo University. Its Engineering College was abolished and new Faculty of Engineering was opened in this year. Its Faculty of Literature was established in 1951. Its Faculty of Engineering took wings and was renamed to Faculty of Science and Engineering in 1962.\n\nIn 1978, Chuo University's headquarters, four faculties and graduate schools including laws, economics, commerce and arts moved to newly established Tama Campus in HachiÅji from the Kanda-Surugadai Campus. The Faculty of Science and Engineering and its Graduate School are still located at the Korakuen Campus. For celebrating its 100th anniversary, in 1988, Chuo University built the Surugadai Memorial Hall which is a seven-story building. It is located at a section on the old Kanda-Surugadai Campus.\n\nIn 1993, the Faculty of Policy Studies was opened on the Tama Campus.\n\nThe Ichigaya Campus was built in 2000 originally as a satellite downtown campus for graduate schools, but, in 2002, a new professional graduate school, Chuo Graduate School of International Accounting and in 2004, another professional graduate school, Chuo Law School were established at the same campus, and then, the satellite downtown campus function for graduate schools partially moved to Ichigaya-Tamachi Campus after it was established in 2010.\n\nIn 2008, Chuo Graduate School of Strategic Management, which is a professional graduate school, was launched at Korakuen Campus. Faculty of Literature was renamed to Faculty of Letters.\n\nThe Ichigaya-Tamachi Campus in Shinjuku was opened in 2010. The Graduate Schools of International Accounting and Public Policy have moved to this campus.\n\nIn 2010, Chuo University celebrated its 125th anniversary and the other university events including the main ceremony were held on November 13.\n\n\n\n\nThis, the main campus, is a short walk from the ChÅ«Å-Daigaku-Meisei-Daigaku Station of the Tama Monorail, easily reachable from the JR ChÅ«Å, KeiÅ or OdakyÅ« line.\n\nIt contains headquarters, all the faculties except for the Faculty of Science and Engineering, five graduate schools including law, economics, commerce, arts and policy studies.\n\nIt can be reached from Kasuga Station (Åedo and Mita subway lines), KÅrakuen Station (Marunouchi and Namboku subway lines), and SuidÅbashi Station (JR ChÅ«Å-SÅbu Line).\n\nIt contains the Faculty of Science and Engineering and its graduate school and the Graduate School of Strategic Management (professional graduate school).\n\nThis is in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo. It can be reached from Akebonobashi Station (Shinjuku subway line), Yotsuya-sanchÅme Station (Marunouchi subway line), and Ichigaya Station (JR ChÅ«Å-SÅbu Line, and Shinjuku, Namboku, and YÅ«rakuchÅ subway lines).\n\nIt contains the Chuo Law School (professional graduate school).\n\nThis too is in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo. It is near Ichigaya Station (JR ChÅ«Å-SÅbu Line, Shinjuku, Namboku, and YÅ«rakuchÅ subway lines).\n\nIt contains the Chuo Graduate School of International Accounting (professional graduate school) and the Graduate School of Public Policy. It is also a downtown satellite campus for graduate schools.\n\nThis is in Chiyoda ward, Tokyo. It can be reached from Ochanomizu Station (JR ChÅ«Å-SÅbu Line and Marunouchi subway line).\n\nChuo has eight research institutions and one research based educational institution.\n\nThis was established as the first research institute for comparative legal studies in Japan and East Asia. Its academic research journal \"HikakuhÅ Zasshi\" is one of the most prestigious academic journals in this field. Its office and library are on Tama Campus.\n\nThis was established in 1964. Its research covers microeconomics, macroeconomics and Marxian economics.\n\nThis was established in 1979. Its research covers a wide range of social sciences including politics, applied policy studies, area studies and modern histories.\n\nThe Japanese name of this institute is \"KigyÅ KenkyÅ«jo\", literally \"Institute for Business Entity Analysis\". It was established in 1979. It is very famous for its large collection of material on Japanese corporations or business entities.\n\nThe Japanese name of this institute is \"Jinbun-kagaku KenkyÅ«jo\", literally \"Institute of Humanities\". The research undertaken by the Institute is primarily collaborative, and involves study of cultural sciences in their broadest sense.\n\nThis was established in 1978. Its main office and laboratories are in the main Gymnastic Building on Tama Campus.\n\nThe institute, established in 1992, promotes joint and project research in science and technology. Its office is on Korakuen Campus.\n\nThe institute was established in 1996 for promoting applied research in policy studies.\n\nThis institute was founded in 1948, for researching practice and theory of corporate accounting, tax, and legislation and/or regulation on business entities. In 1979, Chuo decided to separate it into two. A new Institute of Business Research succeeded research functions and the Institute of Accounting Research changed its function into research-based education in accounting. The institute offers various courses for students who would like to be qualified as CPA or tax accountant, or to become business professionals empowered by the knowledge of accounting.\n\n\"21st Century Center of Excellence\" (COE) program is the Japanese government's special support program for establishing top research centers within research universities. Chuo had this support from 2002 to 2006 for its \"Research on Security and Reliability in Electronic Society\". Combining cryptographic technologies and other social engineering methods including legal studies, Chuo contributed to society on this matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928543", "title": "Proliferation Security Initiative", "text": "Proliferation Security Initiative\n\nThe Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is a global effort that aims to stop trafficking of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), their delivery systems, and related materials to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern. Launched by United States President George W. Bush in May 2003 at a meeting in KrakÃ³w, Poland, the PSI has now grown to include the endorsement of 105 nations around the world, including Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Argentina, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, New Zealand, Republic of Korea and Norway. Despite the support of over half of the Members of the United Nations, a number of countries have expressed opposition to the initiative, including India, China and Indonesia.\n\nThe idea of the PSI is generally credited to John R. Bolton, former US Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, after 15 Scud missiles found on board an unflagged North Korean freighter, the \"So Sen\", heading towards Yemen had to be released when it turned out that international law did not allow them to be confiscated. Given this apparent gap in international law, several months later US President Bush announced the initiative with his counterpart, Polish President Aleksander KwaÅniewski at Wawel Castle in KrakÃ³w on May 31, 2003.\n\nInitially, the PSI included 11 \"core\" states (Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, the US and Poland). On September 4, 2003, in Paris, these countries detailed the principles governing the PSI in a document titled the \"Statement of Interdiction Principles\". The document defines the activities which are to be undertaken by the initiative, specifically \"to establish a more coordinated and effective basis through which to impede and stop shipments of WMD, delivery systems, and related materials flowing to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern, consistent with national legal authorities and relevant international law and frameworks, including the UN Security Council circumstances in which such operations may be carried out (at sea, on land, or in the air) including, most importantly, the requirement that any action taken must be consistent with international law.\" Since the initial core group of 2003, PSI has expanded to include an \"Operational Experts Group\" (OEG) of 21 nations as well as 84 other endorsing states. Key states who have endorsed the initiative since its initial founding include major actors in international trade such as Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, as well as countries such as Turkey and the Republic of Korea, who are geographically close to states designated by United Nations Security Council resolutions as proliferation threats.\n\nEleven nations have signed bilateral Mutual Shipboarding Agreements with the United States, allowing the mutual expedition of shipboarding requests for ships under those nations' flags. The Eleven are the Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Belize, Croatia, Cyprus, Liberia, Malta, the Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Panama and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Each of these nations maintains a large number of commercial vessels on their registries, and are often considered flag of convenience states.\n\nIn April 2009, at a speech in Prague, Czech Republic, newly inaugurated President Barack Obama announced that he planned to transform the PSI into a \"durable international institution\", indicating that US promotion of the initiative would remain non-partisan and cross over from the previous administration. Indeed, Obama had made the strengthening of the PSI one of his campaign promises in the Presidential election of 2008 and continued to promote the PSI through the 2010 White House Nuclear Security Strategy.\n\nThe 2013 PSI High Level Political Meeting facilitated the adoption of a set of four Joint Statements, advancing cooperation among PSI endorsing states toward:\n- Ensuring a Robust Initiative\n- Enhancing Critical Interdiction Capabilities and Practices\n- Strengthening Authorities for Action\n- Expanding Strategic Communications\n\nProgress on implementation was reviewed at the PSI Mid-Level Political Meeting in January 2016, hosted in Washington, DC. Another PSI High Level Political Meeting will be hosted in France in 2018.\n\nThe PSI has evolved considerably since 2003, embracing a much wider array of proliferation security issues, such as customs enforcement, export controls, proliferation finance, and intangible transfers of technology. Given its broad and flexible mandate, the PSI now plays a vital role in advancing proliferation security norms and standards of practice.\n\nThe primary role of PSI participants is to abide by the Statement of Interdiction Principles, with the primary purpose of interdicting subject weapons and materials. Additionally, participants are recommended to enact legal statutes to facilitate effective interdiction and seizure of such items. Finally, participants are to take measures to ensure that their national facilities are not utilized to transfer illicit weapon cargoes.\n\nThe PSI also supports the maintenance of an informal network of transgovernmental linkages that sustain cooperation outside of the formal PSI framework.\n\nIn the United States, the program is managed by the National Security Staff working out of the White House, with the United States Department of State and the United States Department of Defense playing lead roles; with other departments and agencies in supporting roles.\n\nParticipation in PSI activities generally include OEG meetings, live exercises, command post exercises, tabletop exercises, seminars, workshops, and other WMD Interdiction\ntraining. Current members include:\n\n\nEndorsing states are developing a formal set of tools called Critical Capabilities and Practices (CCP) for use by all PSI partners to aid in their ability to interdict WMD. An ongoing effort, the CCP is organized into four elements:\n\nElement 1. Prohibiting Proliferation-Related Conduct â Having in place appropriate legal authorities to prohibit and prevent proliferation activity within and across oneâs border\n\nElement 2. Inspection and Identification â The ability to effectively inspect air, land, and sea cargos and to identify proliferation-related materials\n\nElement 3. Seizure and Disposition â The ability to undertake appropriate actions to seize and dispose of interdiction-related materials\n\nElement 4. Rapid Decision Making â The development of decision-making practices that facilitate timely government responses to interdiction scenarios\n\nExamples of these capacity building tools include:\n\nâ¢ Model Legislation\n\nâ¢ Commodity identification guides and associated training\n\nâ¢ Legal analyses of UN Security Council Resolutions\n\nâ¢ Expert briefings on inspection methodologies\n\nâ¢ Best practices associated with information sharing and decision-making procedures\n\nThe CCP effort is advanced by the CCP Review Team, launched in 2015. The Review Team seeks to enhance the resources available to PSI endorsing countries through compiling a library of tools and resources and through assisting in the coordination of capacity building events and exercises. Review Team members include: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia, and the United States.\n\nThe PSI has no central body or secretariat and is not a coordinator of real-world interdictions. It is a political commitment, a flexible arrangement of international cooperation and is consistent with domestic and international legal authorities. Endorsing states seek a robust capacity to conduct interdictions that usually involve only two or three governments.\n\nPSI activities include the regular holding of activities known as \"exercises,\" which aim to test the authorities and capabilities of endorsee nations to interdict WMD-related materials. Exercises can include \"live action\" events such as ship boardings or container searches, or be limited to \"tabletop\" activities where subject matter experts explore legal and operational interdiction questions related to a fictional scenario. Recent PSI exercises have included:\n\nâ¢PHOENIX EXPRESS 2012 (May), a US-led maritime exercise, with a PSI inject, held in the Mediterranean Sea\n\nâ¢PACIFIC SHIELD 2012 (July), a dedicated PSI exercise hosted by Japan, featuring an air scenario\n\nâ¢PANAMAX 2012 (Aug), a joint U.S./Panama maritime exercise with a PSI inject\n\nâ¢EASTERN ENDEAVOR 2012 (Sep), a dedicated PSI exercise hosted by South Korea, featuring a maritime scenario\n\nâ¢Eastern European PSI Workshop (Nov 2012), hosted by Moldova, featuring a ground-based scenario\n\nâ¢LEADING EDGE 2013 (Feb), a joint UAE/US dedicated PSI exercise featuring air, maritime and ground interdiction activities\n\nâ¢SAHARAN EXPRESS 2013 (Mar), a US-led maritime exercise with a PSI inject, held off the West Coast of Africa\n\nCritics of PSI, such as China, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), argue that the declared intent of PSI members to stop ships on the high seas is a violation of international law guaranteeing freedom of the seas. In particular, it's argued that Article 23 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allows ships \"carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances\" the right of innocent passage through territorial seas. Opponents have asserted that the PSI gives states a license to carry out acts of \"piracy\" on the high seas. It has also been argued the PSI's intent to \"interdict nuclear materials and contraband\" is a broad enough charter to include any naval operation anywhere and for any actual purpose. There are concerns that such actions could lead to war. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda argued that the PSI \"initiative was not initiated through a multilateral process, but only a group of nations that have a common goal to conduct a certain initiatives.\" He also believed that PSI violates the UNCLOS. (Xinhua News Agency, March 17, 2006). Other critics have argued that PSI activities violate international laws regarding self-defense, Articles 19 and 88 of UNCLOS. A large proportion of criticisms of the legality of PSI come from Indian news sources. Criticism over the legality of PSI also focus around the fact that the initiative does not fall under any United Nations committee or body, and that doing so might legitimize it.\n\nMany of academic and news articles about the initiative state that the PSI is focused specifically on states such as Iran and the DPRK. North Korea has stated that it feels the PSI is an instrument for an aggressive war planned by the United States against the DPRK under the pretext of blockading ships and planes. Indian publications discouraging participation in PSI have defined PSI as being specifically directed towards Iran and have stated that \"India on no account should be a part of any anti-Iranian strategic initiative led by the United States.\" Other potential suggested targets of PSI have included Syria, Myanmar, and Pakistan.\n\nDespite these accusations and perceptions, all official PSI documentation and press releases state that PSI does not target any particular state, and that individual nations within the initiative are able to make self-determinations on what shipments are targeted. Several PSI-endorsee states have diplomatic and trade relationships with Iran, the DPRK, and other states suggested as likely targets.\n\nThe preponderance of news sources and academic analysis on the initiative often describe PSI as being a \"US-led\" initiative. Like the issue of whether PSI targets specific states, participants in the initiative itself explicitly deny that it is an effort \"led\" by the United States and that PSI is truly defined by the nonproliferation activities of endorsing nations.\n\nMuch early criticism of the initiative also explicitly linked PSI to other international activities of the globally controversial George W. Bush administration, including namely the War on Terror, invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and a general international perception of US unilateralism outside of United Nations frameworks. Domestically in the United States, liberal critics referenced the PSI and its links to Under-Secretary Bolton as an extension of the Bush Administration's \"Coalition of the willing.\" However, over time much of these criticisms have subsided as PSI activities grew to have large bipartisan support in the United States Congress and the PSI continued to be promoted under the Presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nWith President Obama's continued promotion of the initiative and commitment to expand and institutionalize it, many initial opponents of the initiative have reduced their negative comments and begun efforts to explore joining the initiative in order to be recognized as a player in global non-proliferation efforts.\n\nSome criticism of PSI has been pointed towards the \"secretive\" nature of the initiative. It has been argued that \"the secretiveness surrounding PSI interdictions and the methods employed make it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness or its legitimacy,\" and that the lack of formality and structure in the initiative are causes for concern.\n\nIn a June 2006 speech, then-Undersecretary of State Robert Joseph claimed that between April 2005 and April 2006 the United States had cooperated with other PSI participants on \"roughly two dozen\" occasions to prevent transfers of concern; and in May 2005 Ulrik Federspiel, Denmarkâs ambassador to the United States, asserted that \"the shipment of missiles has fallen significantly in the lifetime of PSI.\" However, references such as these provide no actual information on or evidence of interdictions which have occurred, leaving critics to remain skeptical of such numbers or of any \"metrics\" that prove the effectiveness of the initiative.\n\nWhile these criticisms persist, many PSI events, such as annual Operational Experts Group meetings, contain a very high degree of civil society participation. Think tanks and industry representatives, for instance, participated in the 2016 Operational Experts Group meeting and were permitted to Tweet throughout.\n\nMuch of the criticism about the PSI have been faced with counter-arguments, given the inaccurate or outdated nature of much of the information about the initiative. The most common negative portrayal of PSI represents it as an illegal, US-led effort to interdict third party vessels on the high seas. PSI proponents have countered that:\n\n\n\nTimeline resources and general review of PSI at Biosecurity Commons, A Wiki Database \n\n"}

Like the pub quiz, it is chiefly a British phenomenon although the format has significant differences to a pub quiz due to the usual number of teams (two) and the presence of individual questions.\n\nTwo teams, one , one play each other, responding, perhaps alternately, often orally, to a questionmaster.\n\nMany varying formats exist, one of the most widely played having been devised as a game used by soldiers when relaxing is usually known as the Merseyside Quiz Leagues (MQL) format. It consists of 64 questions in 8 rounds of 8 questions each asked to individuals on the teams alternately. Correctly answering your own question scores 2 points though it can be passed within the team (if the player chooses not to answer) or over to the other team (if the player or team answer wrongly) for one point.\n\nIn the MQL format, there is no conferring as such. Where a player decides not to answer their question, the team captain will normally decide which other member of the team is to answer by assessing the hand signals made by the players on the team and his/her own judgement. The opposition will also use hand signals to decide who is to answer the question in the event of it being passed over. After 4 rounds, the order of answering changes so the team who began round 1 going first begin round 5 going second. This is done by switching each team's questions from A to B or from B to A depending on which questions they started with. The MQL format is played by the main leagues in London and Merseyside.\n\nOther formats exist that involve more conferring within teams, list rounds and \"pick a category\" rounds. All questions are team questions and both teams answer the same questions which are written down on an answer sheet and handed in at the end of the round. There are four rounds of ten questions, and a picture round.\n\nMany quiz leagues run individual competitions. The format used by Merseyside Quiz Leagues and the Quiz League of London is the MIMIR quiz (named after MÃ­mir, a god of Norse mythology who was renowned for his knowledge and wisdom). Matches are played in groups of four with positions drawn at random and each person has 3 questions addressed to them, in each of 5 rounds.\n\nTime to answer is at the discretion of the question master but a wrong answer or a pass gives any of the other three an opportunity to score a bonus point. The decision as to who gets the first chance to answer for a bonus is determined by offering the question to whoever, at that stage, has made least attempts to gain bonus points or, if there is more than one player who has made the least bonus attempts, the next player in line (e.g. if this happened on the first question, P2 would have the first option on a bonus attempt). As well as a scorekeeper, a bonus counter is needed to track each player's bonus attempts.\n\n\n"}

It is specialized in the cross-disciplinary study of information technology.\n\nThe IT University of Copenhagen was established in 1999, which makes it Denmark's youngest university. At that time, it wasâin Danishâcalled \"IT-hÃ¸jskolen\". In 2003, when a new Danish university law was passed, the IT University was officially appointed a university, and changed its name accordingly.\n\nIn 2004, the university moved to its own new building in Ãrestad, a newly developed area in Copenhagen on the island of Amager. The new building was designed by Danish architect Henning Larsen. The university is located right between the University of Copenhagen's new South Campus and the headquarters of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR), and close to the DR Byen metro station. In 2020, the university will extend its campus, taking over facilities in the neighboring DR complex.\n\nThe university originally only accepted students with a Bachelor's degree to its offered Master programs, but started its first Bachelor of Science program in Software Development in August 2007. As of 2018, the IT University offers four Bachelor programs (two of which are internationally oriented and taught in English), five Master study programs (two of which are internationally oriented and are taught in English), Professional Master's study programs, a Diploma program, and approximately 100 single subjects each semester.\n\nThe IT University takes a cross-disciplinary approach to the study of information technology, drawing from a variety of academic perspectives, such as natural sciences (traditional computer science), software engineering, Science and Technology Studies (STS), CSCW, information systems, computer games studies, and the social, economical, cultural, and aesthetic aspects of IT.\n\nThere are approximately 40 members of the scientific staff, 50 Ph.D. students and more than 2,000 students. The student population is 34% female (2016) and 18% international.\n\nThe IT University is governed by a board consisting of 9 members: 5 members recruited from outside of the university form the majority of the board, 1 member is appointed by the scientific staff, 1 member is appointed by the administrative staff, and 2 members are appointed by the university students. The Vice Chancellor is appointed by the university board. The Vice Chancellor in turn appoints deans and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of Vice Chancellor, deans, or department heads. Hence, the university has no faculty governance.\n\nThe stated objective of the university's research is to strengthen Denmark's ability to create value with IT. The research aims to provide new insight that could be the foundation for new types of interaction, new breakthroughs in digital culture, better resource optimization, technological innovation and much more.\nAn important part of the research conducted at the university is the PhD program. Each year, the IT University enrolls PhD students from all over the world.\n\nThe university's research practice is primarily structured through its \"research groups\":\n\n\n"}

Non-nuclear weapon states believed that not enough progress was being made on disarmament to have warranted the Indefinite Extension of the treaty in 1995, and that the nuclear weapons states were not fulfilling their legal responsibilities towards disarmament, as outlined by Article VI of the NPT.\n\nThe NAC was officially launched in Dublin in June 1998, with a Joint Declaration by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, and Slovenia, the latter two of which subsequently left the Coalition.\n\nOn June 9, 1998, an 18-point declaration entitled \"A Nuclear-Weapons-Free World: The Need for a New Agenda\" was signed by the governments of the eight nations of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa, and Sweden to shape foreign policy around the goal of \"the elimination of nuclear weapons and assurance that they will never be produced again.\" Of particular concern to the signatories are the states who have refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Nuclear Free World Policy is considered by many and in the text of the agreement to be a \"fundamental and requisite step\" following from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. New Zealand's stand on nuclear issues was a step on the way towards the Nuclear Free World Policy.\n\nThe declaration begins: \n\n1. We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden have considered the continued threat to humanity represented by the perspective of the indefinite possession of nuclear weapons by the nuclear-weapon states as well as by those three nuclear-weapons-capable states that have not acceded to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the attendant possibility of use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. The seriousness of this predicament has been further underscored by the recent nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2000, the New Agenda Coalition was instrumental in crafting a breakthrough in the NPT Review Conference. While prospects at the outset of the conference initially seemed bleak, the New Agenda Coalition put together a historic agreement outlined in the 13 Steps, in which the nuclear weapons states affirmed, in accordance with Article VI of the NPT, that nuclear disarmament can and should proceed independently of general disarmament, that the nuclear powers have a responsibility to work together on \"an unequivocal undertaking\" to eliminate their arsenals, and that 13 relatively simple steps could help rid the world of nuclear weapons quickly, verifiably, and irreversibly.\n\nSince the 2000 Review conference, the New Agenda Coalition has submitted annual resolutions to the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security. Each of the Coalition's resolutions has been approved by the committee with overwhelming support. They also continue to advance position papers at the NPT review meetings and their preparatory meetings. \n<br>\n\nAll current members of the New Agenda Coalition have joined the Humanitarian Initiative, which was founded in 2013 also in the context of the NPT.\n\n"}

A member of the opposition Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), he served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Bukit Gombak from 1991 to 1997.\n\nLing was the Chairman of the Singapore Democratic Party in 1991 when, in a surprise result, he defeated the incumbent MP from the governing People's Action Party (PAP), Dr Seet Ai Mee, to win the constituency of Bukit Gombak at the general election. Ling won 51.4% of the votes in the constituency to Dr Seet's 48.6%. Ling was one of three SDP MPs to be elected â with the party's leader Chiam See Tong retaining his seat in Potong Pasir, and Cheo Chai Chen winning in Nee Soon Central. The leader of the Workers' Party, Low Thia Khiang, was also elected in Hougang, giving the opposition parties a total of four seats. At the previous election, Chiam had been the only opposition MP to win a seat, so the results were seen as a significant success for the opposition.\n\nIn 1994, the SDP appointed Ling to take over from Chiam as the party's parliamentary leader after Chiam fell out with the rest of the party's Central Executive Committee (CEC). Chiam resigned as the party's Secretary-General and was replaced by Dr Chee Soon Juan. After he publicly criticised them, the CEC attempted to expel Chiam from the party (which would have forced him to vacate his parliamentary seat), but he won a court case to prevent them from doing so on procedural grounds.\n\nLing hit the headlines in 1996 after Chiam whispered something into his ear during a debate in Parliament, to which Ling loudly responded \"Don't talk cock!\" (a Singlish phrase meaning \"Don't speak nonsense\"). Ling was formally censured by Parliament for using inappropriate language in the chamber as a result of this.\n\nChiam joined the Singapore People's Party (SPP) after Parliament was dissolved ahead of the election, was re-elected as Potong Pasir's MP representing his new party. However, Ling was defeated in his bid to be re-elected as MP for Bukit Gombak at the 1997 general election, losing to the PAP's Ang Mong Seng. Ling won 28.4% of the votes to Ang's 65.1%, with Syed Farid Wajidi from SPP taking 6.5% of the votes. Cheo was also defeated in his re-election bid. The SDP was thus left with no seats in Parliament.\n\nFor the 2001 general election, Ling's old seat of Bukit Gombak was abolished following boundary changes. Ling stood in Cheo's former constituency of Nee Soon Central, and was defeated by the PAP's Ong Ah Heng. Ling received 21.5% of the votes to Ong's 78.5%.\n\nAt the 2006 general election, Ling contested the seat of Bukit Panjang. He won 22.8% of the votes, losing to the PAP's Teo Ho Pin who gained 77.2%. During the election campaign, he was threatened with a defamation lawsuit by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as a result of an article published in the SDP's party newspaper. On 24 April 2006, Ling said that he would not apologise as he did not know about the article until it had been published. However he eventually agreed to a settlement and issued an apology for the publication the article.\n\nLing was educated at Anglo-Chinese School and Nan Hua High School. He was called to the Bar in at the Middle Temple in London in 1972.\n\nLing has been a practicing lawyer since 1972.\n\nLing is married and has three sons.\n"}
{"id": "1928567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928567", "title": "Pupillage", "text": "Pupillage\n\nA pupillage, in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, Kenya, Pakistan and Hong Kong, is the final, vocational stage of training for those wishing to become practising barristers. Pupillage is similar to an apprenticeship, during which bar graduates build on what they have learnt during the BPTC or equivalent by combining it with practical work experience in a set of barristers' chambers or pupillage training organisation.\n\nA pupillage is the final stage of training to be a barrister and usually lasts one year; in England and Wales the period is made up of two six-month periods (known as \"sixes\"). The first of these is the non-practising six, during which pupils shadow their pupil supervisor, and the second will be a practising six, when pupils can undertake to supply legal services and exercise rights of audience.\n\nAt the end of the first six months, a pupil needs to have the pupil supervisor sign a certificate confirming satisfactory completion and send it to the Bar Standards Board. The pupil receives a Provisional Qualification Certificate. At the end of the second six months, the pupil's supervisor must certify another document for satisfactory completion and send it to the Bar Standards Board pupillage records office. The pupil will then receive a Full Qualification Certificate.\n\nPupillages are split into two different phases. The \"first six\" involves observing the pupil's supervisor at court and in conference, and assisting with related paperwork. In many chambers, this is the more relaxed part of the pupillage, as the pupil has little responsibility.\n\nIn the second six months of pupillage, each pupil is responsible for a personal case load. This will range from a first appearance in the county court or magistrates' court, hearings in the High Court, or Crown Court to full trials. Some second-six pupils may gain experience of jury trials, but this is extremely rare. Generally speaking, most second-six pupils handle minor proceedings such as case management conferences, plea and directions hearings, infant settlements or small claims cases, such as possession hearings, debt recovery proceedings or road traffic claims.\n\nThe amount of work that a pupil gains in the second six depends on the chambers. Second-six pupils in criminal sets are typically in court several times a week, while pupils in civil sets may have only two or three cases in a week. Second-six pupils in commercial sets can go their entire pupillage without ever appearing in court.\n\nIn most leading criminal and civil sets, pupils receive a frequent supply of work. However, as clerks do not prioritise pupils, it may take some time before they are paid for their work. In some cases, pupils will never be paid for the work carried out in court. This has led to a situation where pupils struggle to make ends meet, especially in criminal sets.\n\nThe financial position of pupils varies enormously. Some pupil barristers will earn Â£12,000 (Bar Council minimum) or Â£18,436 in London Chambers (the Bar Council minimum in London) for a 12-month pupillage. A pupil at a top commercial chambers can be paid Â£65,000. The Bar Council has decreed that all pupils must be remunerated in the minimum sum of Â£1000 per month, equating to Â£12,000 per year, which must be made up of (at minimum) an award of Â£6,000 in the first six and guaranteed earnings of Â£6,000 in the second six. It is usual practice for Chambers to allow pupils to retain all second-six earnings in excess of this amount, although these can be subject to deductions for clerking, chambers expenses and other sums. It can take several months for solicitors to pay pupils for magistrates' court work, which can cause financial hardship for some.\n\nWhile pupils are allowed to supplement their incomes by undertaking part-time work outside of their pupillages, with the permission of their pupil master or Head of Chambers, the Bar Council requires pupils to apply themselves full-time to pupillage. Opportunities for earning outside of pupillage are limited by time constraints.\n\nPupillage is recognised as a difficult and demanding time. Pupils must attempt to impress as many members of their chambers as possible. They also have to impress their clerks by completing as many cases as possible and satisfying solicitors.\n\nThe Working Time Directive applies to pupillages. Formally, pupils may work a maximum of 48 hours per week, unless an opt-out has been signed.\n\nProspective pupils can apply in advance for pupillages offered through Pupillage Gateway (a web-based application centre) usually about one year ahead of the proposed starting date. Non-Pupillage Portal chambers have their own application procedures, and details of how to contact all chambers with pupillages are advertised on the Pupillage Portal website.\n\nGaining a pupillage is not easy. There is some evidence to suggest that every year around only 5â10% of applicants are successful. A candidate needs to demonstrate strong academic qualifications (preferably First Class Honours degree from a leading university, but normally an Upper Second at the very least) or excellent extracurricular activities.\n\nPupillage in Hong Kong generally lasts 12 months. The period may be shortened for those with advocacy experience in other jurisdictions or as a solicitor. A pupil barrister may be admitted after 6 months pupillage and then obtain a limited practising certificate that allows them to practise under the supervision of their pupil master.\n\nThere is no contractual relationship between pupil master and pupil in Hong Kong, and pupils are not as a general rule paid. However, the Hong Kong Bar Association encourages pupil masters to remunerate their pupils where the pupil has done work of value to them at any stage of their pupillage. Starting from 1 September 2019, pupil masters are required to pay an honorarium of HK$6,000 per month to their pupils.\n\nThere is no central system for obtaining pupils and prospective pupils must apply directly to chambers or to barristers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1928569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928569", "title": "Swedish heraldry", "text": "Swedish heraldry\n\nSwedish heraldry encompasses heraldic achievements in modern and historic Sweden. Swedish heraldic style is consistent with the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, noted for its multiple helmets and crests which are treated as inseparable from the shield, its repetition of colours and charges between the shield and the crest, and its scant use of heraldic furs. Because the medieval history of the Nordic countries was so closely related, their heraldic individuality developed rather late. Swedish and Finnish heraldry have a shared history prior to the Diet of Porvoo in 1809; these, together with Danish heraldry, were heavily influenced by German heraldry. Unlike the highly stylized and macaronic language of English blazon, Swedish heraldry is described in plain language, using (in most cases) only Swedish terminology.\n\nThe earliest known achievements of arms in Sweden are those of two brothers, Sigtrygg and Lars Bengtsson, from 1219. The earliest example of Swedish civic heraldry is the city arms of Kalmar, which originated as a city seal in 1247. The seal (Swedish \"sigill\"), used extensively in the Middle Ages, was instrumental in spreading heraldry to churches, local governments, and other institutions, and was the forerunner of the coat of arms in medieval Sweden. Armorial seals of noblewomen appeared in the 12th century, burghers and artisans began adopting arms in the 13th century, and even some peasants took arms in the 14th century.\n\nHeraldry in Sweden today is used extensively by corporations and government offices; the rights of these private entities and of official bodies are upheld by Swedish law. In order to become legally registered and protected under Swedish law, an official coat of arms must be registered with the Swedish Patent and Registration Office (PRV), and is subject to approval by the National Herald (\"Statsheraldiker\") and the bureaucratic Heraldic Board of the National Archives of Sweden. Heraldic arms of common citizens (burgher arms), however, are less strictly controlled. These are recognised by inclusion in the annually published \"Scandinavian Roll of Arms\".\n\nSwedish heraldry has a number of characteristics that distinguish the Swedish style from heraldry in other European countries. Common features of Swedish heraldry are similar to those of other Nordic countries and Germany, placing it in the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, distinguished from Gallo-British heraldry and other heraldic traditions by several key elements of heraldic style. One of these is the use of multiple helmets and crests, which cannot be displayed separately from the main shield. These helmets and crests are considered to be as important as the shield, each denoting a fief over which the bearer holds a right. In Scandinavia (as distinct from the German custom), when an even number of helmets is displayed, they are usually turned, with their crests, to face outward; when an odd number, the center helmet is turned \"affrontÃ©\" and the rest turned outward (whereas in Germany the helmets are turned inward to face the center of the escutcheon). Additionally, the crests are often repetitive of charges used on the main shield, and marks of cadency typically occur in the crest, rather than on the shield as in Gallo-British heraldry. Also, the use of heraldic furs on the shield, while common in Gallo-British heraldry, is rare in German-Nordic heraldry. Furs in Scandinavia are generally limited to ermine and vair, which sometimes appear in mantling, supporters, or the trimmings of crowns, but rarely on the shield.\n\nConsistent with German-Nordic heraldry, the most common charges in Swedish heraldry include lions and eagles. Additional animals that frequently appear in Swedish heraldry include griffins and (especially in the northern provinces) reindeer. Stars are common and are usually depicted with six points and straight sides, in contrast to the Gallo-British tradition, which typically depicts stars as either a five-pointed straight-sided star (\"mullet\") or as a six-pointed wavy-sided star (\"estoile\"). In Swedish, these stars are usually described as \"six-pointed stars\" (\"sexuddig stjÃ¤rna\"). In terms of blazoning, Swedish heraldry is described in plain terms using common Swedish language, rather than using specialized language such as Blazon. Canting arms occur frequently.\n\nIn English, achievements of arms are usually described (\"blazoned\") in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In Swedish, however, achievements of arms are described in relatively plain language, using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples include the use of Swedish \"blÃ¥\" and \"grÃ¶n\" for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived \"azure\" and \"vert\" used in English blazon. Rather than \"argent\", the Swedish words \"silver\" or \"vit\" (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. \"Purpur\" (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. \"Ermine\" likewise appears in the lining of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in Swedish heraldry. \"Vair\" is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, heraldic arms in Sweden were granted by the Royal Council (\"kungliga kansliet\"), but this role was turned over to the College of Antiquities (\"antikvitetskollegiet\") in 1660.\nPrior to 1953, the office of the National Herald (\"Riksheraldiker\") was responsible for preparing municipal arms and the royal arms of Sweden, but today these duties are carried out by the Heraldry Board of the National Archives, including the State Herald (\"Statsheraldiker\"). In order to register new municipal arms, a municipality must submit its proposal to both the National Archives Heraldry Board, which consults and renders an opinion, and to the PRV for registration. Once the board has completed its consultation process and provided a warrant of arms, the arms thus warranted may then be registered by the PRV and implemented by the municipality. Apart from municipal arms, heraldic arms registered by counties and by military and other government bodies are also handled by the National Archives Heraldry Board and the PRV.\n\nThe National Archives Heraldry Board, established under Swedish statute 2007:1179, is the highest heraldic body in Sweden. The board is chaired by the National Archivist and includes three other officials, three deputies, the State Herald (who acts as secretary), the National Archives jurist and the National Archives heraldic artist. This board convenes as needed, which in recent years has been once or twice a year.\n\nThe first National Herald was Conrad Ludvig TranskiÃ¶ld (died 1766), who served as \"Riksheraldiker\" 1734â1765. Subsequent National Heralds included Daniel Tilas (1768â1772), Anders SchÃ¶nberg (1773â1809), Jonas Carl Linnerhielm (1809â1829), Niklas Joakim af Wetterstedt (1829â1855), August Wilhelm Stiernstedt (1855â1880), Carl Arvid Klingspor (1880â1903), Adam Lewenhaupt (1903â1931) and Harald Fleetwood (1931â1953), and State Heralds (since the 1953 reform) have included Carl Gunnar Ulrik Scheffer (1953â1974), Lars-Olof Skoglund (1975), Jan von Konow (1975â1981), Bo Elthammar (1981â1983), and Clara NevÃ©us (1983â1999). Since 1999, the State Herald of Sweden has been Henrik Klackenberg.\n\nThe Swedish Collegium of Arms, operating under the Swedish Heraldry Society, is responsible for reviewing and registering burgher arms. The Swedish Heraldry Society is a non-profit association founded in 1976, and is not affiliated with the National Archives or their Heraldry Board, which registers arms of municipalities and other public entities.\n\nMembers of the Swedish Royal House have their own coats of arms and these are based on the greater coat of arms.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, heraldry in Sweden was primarily the domain of the high nobility. In the 17th and 18th century, the nobility fought to ban burgher arms (\"borgerliga vapen\"). The result in 1767 was a compromise in that granted the nobility the exclusive right to barred or open helmets, coronets, and supporters, while \"the Town law of 1730 stated that burgher arms are accepted since they are not forbidden.\"\n\nA coronet of eleven pearls denotes a baron's arms in Sweden (the ancient nobility does also have the right to have the baronet crown by tradition), which also typically includes two barred helmets, each wearing this coronet, and a third such coronet is placed above the shield, although some baronial arms feature three helmets or only one, and not every baron uses supporters. A Swedish \"Greve\" (Count) bears three barred helmets, each crowned with a coronet showing five leaves, and supporters are usuallyâthough not alwaysâpresent. The arms of Swedish counts also, from the late 17th century, began using manteaux (see the Greater Coat of Arms of Sweden, pictured above) in place of the traditional mantling, although this practice has since been deprecated. Untitled nobility (others granted noble status by letters patent) also bore a barred helm and a coronet showing two pearls between three leaves.\n\nThe earliest known achievements of heraldry in Sweden were the noble arms of two brothers, Sigtrygg and Lars Bengtsson, of the Boberg family, dating to 1219. Other noble arms may have been adopted into civic heraldry within their bearers' areas of influence, such as the adoption of the arms of Bo Jonsson (Grip) by SÃ¶dermanland; the direct adoption of Jonsson's arms is disputed, but at the least, a certain heraldic influence is evident. The last charter of nobility in Sweden was issued by King Oskar II to Swedish explorer Sven Hedin in 1902; this may well be the last charter ever. The 1974 constitution does not mention charters nor the nobility, and the Royal orders of the State (not including, however, the Order of Carl XIII) can not be conferred to Swedes according to a special ordinance. The house of nobility lost the last of its official privileges in 2003. Noble arms (\"adliga vapen\"), together with royal and municipal heraldry, are protected under Swedish law since 1970.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, heraldry in Sweden was primarily the domain of the high nobility, but burgher arms came to Sweden in the 14th century by way of the Hansa trade. This may have been especially true in Stockholm, where there was a large German population. While burgher arms became popular among the merchants of the Middle Ages, by the 16th and 17th century their use was \"common among the non-noble officers, judges and priests ... while the merchants tended to give up the tradition of heraldic seals and replace them with ownerâs marks.\" In contrast to noble arms, burgher arms are allowed only a shield with one tilting or closed helmet without a necklace or coronet. A wreath and crest must be placed on the helmet, and a motto or war cry can be used. Unlike noble arms, few burgher arms were handed down through the generations.\n\nBurgher arms are not required to be registered with the PRV, and so they are not protected under Swedish law (1970:498). According to the Swedish Heraldry Society, the most common way of obtaining recognition of burgher arms is by inclusion in the annually published \"Scandinavian Roll of Arms\" (\"Skandinavisk Vapenrulla\"), which was first published in 1963 and currently includes over 400 Swedish family coats of arms, along with arms from the other Scandinavian countries. Upon submission to the Swedish Heraldry Society, burgher arms are reviewed by the Swedish Collegium of Arms, whose decisions are published in the \"Scandinavian Roll of Arms\". Approximately 3000 burgher arms are known today in Sweden. Swedish law protects \"arms of the nobility as well as civic bodies, while burgher arms are not [protected], unless registered as a logotype.\"\n\nThe Swedish arms evolved from royal heraldry. Traditionally, only persons bore arms and so these arms were originally only arms of the monarchs. Gradually, however, they have also become considered \"national arms\".\n\nThe greater national arms (\"stora riksvapnet\") originated in 1448 and has remained unchanged in Swedish law since 1943. The first legislation of state arms in Sweden was in 1908, and prior to that the state arms were changed by royal decree. It also, as it originally was, remains to be the personal coat of arms of the king of Sweden; as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the Royal House, with the alterations and additions decided by him. Since the beginning of the reign of Gustav Vasa in 1523 it has been customary in Sweden to display the arms of the ruling dynasty as an inescutcheon in the centre of the greater arms.\n\nThe coat of arms of Queen Silvia of Sweden is similar to the greater arms of Sweden, but without the ermine mantling, and with the central inescutcheon exchanged for her personal arms: \"Per pale gules and Or, a fleur-de-lis counterchanged.\" The shield is encircled by an azure ribbon with dependent cross of the Order of the Seraphim.\n\nThe lesser coat of arms of Sweden (\"lilla riksvapnet\") is emblazoned: \"Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one; Crowned with a royal crown.\" This is the emblem used by the government of Sweden and its agencies; it is, for example, embroidered on all Swedish police uniforms. Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one is considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by Swedish Law, Act 1970:498.\n\nThe three crowns have been a national symbol of Sweden for centuries; historians trace the use of the symbol back to the royal seal of Albrecht of Mecklenburg, and even earlier. The three crowns have been recognized as the official arms of Sweden since the 14th century. The earliest credible attribution of the three crowns is to Magnus Eriksson, who reigned over Norway and Sweden, and in 1330s, bought Scania from Denmark. Written in 1378, Ernst von Kirchberg's \"Reimchronik\" depicted Magnus Eriksson with a national banner of dark blue, charged with three crowns, although this banner did not ultimately become the national flag of Sweden.\n\nSwedish military heraldry made news headlines in Sweden and overseas in 2007, when a controversial change was made to the arms of the Nordic Battlegroup at the behest of a group of female soldiers who demanded that the lion's genitals be removed from the arms. Vladimir Sagerlund, heraldic artist at the National Archives since 1994, was critical of the decision, saying, \"once upon a time coats of arms containing lions without genitalia were given to those who betrayed the Crown.\" \"The Times\" in London noted a recent trend toward heraldic \"castration\", pointing to the lions passant on the royal coat of arms of England, as well as the lions rampant on those of Norway, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Scotland, all of which have been depicted without genitals; in conclusion, \"The Times\" wrote, \"some crests are ambiguous, but the message remains clear: the lions are supposed to display courage and nothing else.\" Officials at the National Archives treat this as a change in artistic style, rather than a heraldic change, and the lion remains in its original form on the rolls of the National Archives, while the castrated lion appears on the unit's sleeve patches. The Nordic Battle Group's coat of arms was originally designed to incorporate heraldic elements and colours from all member nations, including \"a lion that did not look Finnish, Norwegian, Estonian or Swedish.\" In an unusual move, the Armed Forces Heraldry Council authorised the Nordic Battle Group commander's use of a command sign. This consisted of a bunting divided into fields of blue, gold and blue with a Roman numeral V in the gold field, since the unit would be the fifth mobilized combat unit of the European Union.\n\nThe coat of arms of the Swedish Army consists of two crossed golden swords on a blue field. This motif is repeated in the flag of the Inspector General of the Army, and a blue field with a single upright golden sword appears on the flag of Military Region Command infrastructure, with three gold crowns in the canton.\n\nThe coat of arms of the Swedish Navy, which consists of a blue field with two cannons in saltire and a cabled anchor, topped with a crown, and has been used on the flags of naval commanders, including on the flag of the Inspector General of the Navy, the most senior representative of the Swedish Navyâs combat forces.\n\nEach of Sweden's 21 counties (\"lÃ¤n\"), 25 provinces (\"landskap\") and 290 municipalities (\"kommun\") has its own coat of arms. The Instrument of Government (1634) introduced the modern counties of Sweden, superseding the 25 medieval provinces. Although many of these counties have been the subject of more recent reforms, many of them occupy broadly similar regions. (See comparative maps at Counties of Sweden.) Most of the counties that have remained largely intact (Dalarna, Gotland, SkÃ¥ne, SÃ¶dermanland, Uppsala, VÃ¤rmland, etc.) retain the respective province's coat of arms, while the redistricting of other lands has been reflected heraldically (e.g. the newly created GÃ¤vleborgs lÃ¤n, occupying parts of HÃ¤lsingland and GÃ¤strikland, bears their arms quarterly). By royal decree on 18 January 1884, King Oscar II granted all provinces the rights to the rank of duchy and to display their arms with a ducal coronet. While more exhaustive lists can be found elsewhere, this article only discusses the arms of a few of these regions, selected for their heraldic notability. The arms of Gotland, VÃ¤sterbotten, Uppland, SÃ¶dermanland, SkÃ¥ne and Lappland will be considered here in further detail.\n\nGotland, as a free republic loosely associated with the Swedish crown, had already borne a ram with a banner (\"Agnus Dei\") as a well-known city seal by 1280. Although the island belonged to Denmark at the time, its arms were present at Gustav Vasa's funeral procession in 1560; the arms of Gotland disappeared from the Swedish rolls in 1570 but returned with the transfer of Gotland to Sweden in 1645. The coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: \"Azure, a ram statant\"\" argent armed Or, bearing on a cross-staff of the same a banner Gules bordered and with five tails of the third.\" The county was granted the same coat of arms in 1936. The municipality, created in 1971, uses the same arms on a red field, influenced by the arms of Visby.\nVÃ¤sterbotten received arms in preparation for Gustav Vasa's funeral in 1560. According to the Swedish Heraldry Society, the reindeer came to represent all lands west of the Gulf of Bothnia at that time, and VÃ¤sterbotten's coat of arms received its stars in the 1590s. Blazon: \"Azure, on a semÃ© of stars Or, a reindeer springing argent armed gules.\" The modern VÃ¤sterbotten County still bears these arms in the upper portion of a shield divided \"per fess\", with the arms of Lappland and Ãngermanland in the base, to illustrate the merging of lands from these two provinces into the modern county. Blazon: \"Party per fess, in chief the arms of VÃ¤sterbotten, and in base party per pale the arms of Lappland (dexter) and Ãngermanland (sinister).\"\nUppland was granted arms created for Gustav Vasa's funeral in 1560, and the royal orb symbolises spiritual and worldly power. Historically, Uppland ranked as a duchy and the coat of arms was represented with a ducal coronet. Despite the fact that Uppsala lÃ¤n has a different name and a smaller territory, it was granted the same coat of arms in 1940, but with a royal crown in place of the ducal crown of the landskap arms. Blazon: \"Gules, a royal orb Or.\"\n\nSÃ¶dermanland was granted its coat of arms in 1560. According to the Swedish Heraldry Society, the arms were created for Gustav Vasa's funeral, and the choice of the griffin as charge may have been influenced by the name of Gripsholm (once home of Bo Jonsson Grip). Since 1884, the coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. The same coat of arms was granted to SÃ¶dermanland county in 1940. Blazon: \"Or, a griffin segreant sable, armed and langued gules, when it should be armed.\"\nSkÃ¥ne was a Danish province without heraldic arms before its transfer to Sweden in 1658, and its arms, granted in 1660, are based on the city of MalmÃ¶'s Danish era arms. The MalmÃ¶ arms were granted in 1437 during the Kalmar Union by Eric of Pomerania and contains a Pomeranian griffin. The SkÃ¥ne coat of arms was created for the funeral of Charles X Gustav of Sweden in 1660, and it is typically represented with a ducal coronet. The coat of arms for the new SkÃ¥ne County, formed in 1997, was based on the arms of Kristianstad County and MalmÃ¶hus County, which in turn were based on the province arms (both former counties were divided from the old SkÃ¥ne province); the SkÃ¥ne County arms are the province arms with different colors. When the county arms is shown crowned with a Swedish royal crown, it represents the County Administrative Board, which is the regional presence of royal government authority. Blazon: \"Or, a Griffin's head erased Gules, crowned and langued Azure, when it should be armed.\"\nLappland itself was never considered a duchy, but was granted the right to use a ducal coronet, together with all the provinces, in 1884. The wildman first appears on a few coins minted at the time of Karl IX's coronation in 1607, and then at his funeral in 1612. Blazon: \"Argent, a savage statant gules, crowned and clothed with birch wreaths vert, maintaining in the right hand â and depending over the shoulder â a club Or.\"\n\nThere are 290 municipalities in Sweden, each with its own coat of arms. A local government reform in the 1960sâ1970s made all cities part of a municipality. The city arms oftenâbut not alwaysâbecame the coat of arms of the new municipality. As some municipalities were created at this time by merging smaller communities, this led in some cases to arms consisting of two parts, each derived from one of the communities. Some new municipalities also lacked historical cities within, and therefore created wholly new coats of arms. Municipalities which carry the name of a city (with a few exceptionsâsee below) traditionally display a mural crown on top of their coat of arms. While no law forbids other municipalities from using the mural crown, it is customarily reserved for those bearing former city arms. Kalmar was the first to establish city arms in 1247, and Stockholm, Skara and Ãrebro were also among the first cities in Sweden to establish city arms. As recently as 2007, HÃ¤rryda Municipality was among the last municipalities in Sweden to replace its logo with a newly registered coat of arms. Municipal arms may not use any colors (tinctures) other than argent, Or, gules, azure, sable and vert. As in other heraldic traditions, the rule of tincture applies and it is the blazonânot the imageâthat is legally registered.\n\nThe following is not an exhaustive list of the 133 historic cities in Sweden, but a brief list of cities that are notable and bear heraldic significance within the context of Swedish heraldry. Each is listed by the city name, in general chronological order with the approximate year of settlement or city charter. Note that most city arms originated in the Middle Ages as a city seal, and all were registered as municipality (\"kommun\") arms in the 1970s.\n\nSigtuna (990), one of the oldest cities in Sweden, is known for its Viking Age history and rune stones. In medieval times, coins were minted at Sigtuna, and legend suggests it was the royal seat for a time, signified by the crown on its arms. The crown appeared in the city seal in 1311, and carried through to the municipal arms granted in 1971. Blazon: \"Azure, a crown Or between three mullets argent.\"\nKalmar (1100) has the oldest known city arms in Sweden, depicting a fortified tower (\"borgtorn\") and dating to 1247. The two stars were added by the end of the 13th century, and the arms have remained virtually unchanged to date. Blazon: \"Argent, a tower embattled gules, with door and windows Or, issuing from a wavy base azure, between two mullets of six points gules.\"\nArboga (13th century), settled in the 10th century, has been a city since 1480 and was the site of the first Riksdag of the Estates assembled in 1435. Arboga's city arms originated from a city seal dating from 1330. The original city seal showed an eagle with three roundels placed one on each wing and the tail, and a letter \"A\" between two stars. The \"A\" was omitted and the stars moved onto the eagle's wings in 1969, and the same arms granted to the municipality in 1974. Blazon: \"Argent, an eagle sable, beaked langued and armed gules, each wing charged with a mullet of six points Or.\"\nMalmÃ¶ (1250) is the third largest city in Sweden. MalmÃ¶'s arms, granted by royal decree of Eric of Pomerania in 1437, survive virtually unchanged today and, together with Halmstad, are unique in having a helmet and crest included in the achievement of arms. MalmÃ¶'s City Archives still preserve the letter written April 23, 1437 by Eric, granting his own griffin head arms to the city. Blazon: \"Argent, a griffin head [erased] gules crowned Or; the same upon the helmet, issuing from the crown a bundle of ostrich feathers argent and gules.\"\nStockholm (1250) is the largest city and present-day capital of Sweden. The original city seal depicted a city, but in 1376, the head of Saint Erik was introduced and remains in the city's seal to present day. In the 1920s, the city arms were revised, based upon a church icon said to represent Saint Olaf, although the blazon clearly indicates Saint Erik as the intended subject, and these arms were officially granted in 1934. Blazon: \"Azure, a crowned head of Saint Erik [couped] Or.\"\n\nUppsala (1286) was the seat of power in Sweden from antiquity. Since the 12th century, it has been the ecclesiastical center of Sweden, and it is the site of the oldest university in Sweden. The origin of the city arms is somewhat obscure, but the lion has been featured on Uppsala's city seal since 1737, and in the city arms which were granted in 1943. Up until the 18th century (1737) there were different forms of a church in the city seal like in the arms of the city of Skara, also a seat of a bishop. Blazon: \"Azure, a crowned lion passant gardant Or, fimbriated sable and langued and armed gules.\"\nLandskrona (1413) was established by Eric of Pomerania while the region was part of Denmark, as an anti-Hansa city to compete with other Danish port cities under Hansa control. The city was originally symbolised by a gold \"queen's crown\" on a red field, in direct reference to Margrethe Valdemarsdatter, and the city received its present arms in 1880, based on a city seal from 1663 depicting a crown, a lion, a ship and a cornucopia on a quartered field. Landskrona is unique among Swedish municipal arms in having its own crown and supporters as part of its own achievement. Landskrona's own crown replaces the wall crown, which it has the right to use.\nGothenburg (1619), the second largest city in Sweden, was founded in 1621 by Gustav II Adolf. The city arms feature the Folkung lion of the Greater Coat of Arms of Sweden, but armed with a drawn sword and bearing the \"Svea Rikes\" shield (a blue shield charged with three gold crowns). The lion, king of the animals, stands for power and agility. The direction of the Gothenburg lion and the crown have been especially controversial. The blazon received in 1952 read: \"\"Azure, three wavy bends sinister argent, overlaid with a lion contournÃ© crowned with closed crown Or, with forked tail, langued and armed gules, swinging with the right forepaw a sword Or, and maintaining in the left a shield azure with three crowns Or, arranged two and one.\"\"\nKiruna (1948), an iron mining town in the 20th century, became chartered as the northernmost city in Sweden in 1948 and is the seat of Kiruna Municipality, which also includes the annually rebuilt ice hotel in nearby JukkasjÃ¤rvi. The city arms of Kiruna were granted in 1949, and the municipal arms were registered in 1974. Blazon: \"Party per fess: Argent, the Iron alchemical symbol azure; Azure, a ptarmigan argent.\" Sparking local political controversy, the ptarmigan received red claws and beak in 1971.\n\nThe following examples do not represent an exhaustive list of Swedish municipal arms. See the list of municipalities of Sweden for a complete listing of these.\n\nOxelÃ¶sund is one example of a municipality emerging from a split between two cities â in this case, NykÃ¶ping and OxelÃ¶sund, which are now in neighboring municipalities since the splitting of Nikolai rural municipality in 1950. The town of OxelÃ¶sund was established in 1900 and became a city in 1950, when it became a separate municipality from NykÃ¶ping.\nStenungsund is one example of a municipality that, having no historic city arms, created wholly new arms in the 1970s. This device, displaying a hydrocarbon molecule, alludes to the area's petrochemical industry, and is also an example of distinctly modern arms. The arms, registered with the PRV in 1977, display: \"Argent, a hydrocarbon molecule of three pellets conjoined with six bezants gules, over a base wavy azure\".\n\nMullsjÃ¶ Municipality was newly created in 1952. The coat of arms, granted in 1977, was proposed by the municipality's recreation committee, to market the municipality as a center for winter sports. The snow crystal is a relatively modern charge, and the modern tree-top line, called \"kuusikoro\" in Finnish, is reflective of the Finnish influence on Swedish heraldry. Blazon: \"Azure, a snow crystal argent beneath a spruce-top chief of the same.\"\nKrokom Municipality was formed in 1974 and bears arms granted in 1977, featuring a ram (\"gumsen\") based on a 6000-year-old rock carving at GlÃ¶sabÃ¤cken. The ram seen here was included in the seal of the legislature of RÃ¶dÃ¶n from 1658. While petroglyphs long predate heraldry, they rarely appear in heraldic armory. Blazon: \"Argent, a chevron gemel wavy inverted and diminished azure, beneath a ram in the manner of a rock carving gules.\"\n\nThe Church of Sweden (\"Svenska kyrkan\") is the national church (\"folkkyrka\") and, until 2000, was the state church (\"statskyrka\") of Sweden. The arms of the church have been found displayed on a 14th-century heraldic flag discovered in Uppsala cathedral, and are blazoned: \"Or, upon a cross gules, a crown Or.\" The crown has long been said to represent St. Erik, but in early 2005, the church issued a press release adopting \"a new interpretation of the 600-year-old coat of arms which was found in Uppsala cathedral,\" calling it the victory crown of Christ (\"Kristi segerkrona\"). The Church of Sweden also has many dioceses and parishes with their own coats of arms.\n\nAccording to tradition, bishops may use the arms of their diocese marshalled with their own personal arms, with a mitre in place of the helmet and a crosier displayed behind the shield, but these are removed when the bishop retires. These arms may take the form of a shield divided per pale or quartered with the arms of the diocese in the first and third quarters and the bishop's personal arms in the second and fourth quarters. The cross staff or \"primate cross\" is used only by the Archbishop of Uppsala and the Bishop of Lund, crossed with the crosier behind the shield. Antje JackelÃ©n, Bishop of Lund, uses the traditional oval shield of a woman's arms, and her arms were designed by the diocese's heraldist, Jan Raneke. Raneke also designed the arms of JackelÃ©n's predecessor, Christina Odenberg, who was the first woman to be a bishop in the Church of Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928570", "title": "Het Laatste Nieuws", "text": "Het Laatste Nieuws\n\nHet Laatste Nieuws (in English \"The Latest News\") is a Dutch language newspaper based in Antwerp, Belgium. It was founded by Julius Hoste Sr. on 7 June 1888. It is now part of DPG Media, and is the most popular newspaper in Flanders and Belgium.\n\nThe liberal Julius Hoste Sr. founded the newspaper on 7 June 1888 five days before the Belgian elections. With his newspaper he wanted to support the Liberal Party in the upcoming elections and on the other side the Flemish movement in Brussels, a city which was dominated by francophone bourgeois (\"Franskiljons\"). The newspaper supported the cause of the \"Gelijkheidswet\" (E: equality law between French and Flemish in Belgium), the rescue of the \"Koninklijke Vlaamse Schouwburg\" (KVS) (E: Royal Flemish Theatre) in Brussels and the election of the first Flemish, liberal, Ghent municipal governing board in 1907.\n\nIts liberal character, anti-francophone stance and support for the Flemish movement were essential characteristics of the new daily, just like its anti-clericalism. In 1897, Flor Burton founded the newspaper \"De Nieuwe Gazet\" in Antwerp, with a substantially similar editorial policy.\n\nWhen Julius Hoste Sr. died, his son, Julius Hoste Jr., took over full publishing responsibility. He moderated the confrontational style favored by his father, adopting a more temperate and formal tone. He broadened the scope of the newspaper, including more regional news, and expanded the sports section to reach an even wider public.\n\nWhen World War II broke out, Julius Hoste Jr. fled to the United Kingdom, although his newspaper continued publication under Nazi control. During this period \"The Adventures of Tintin\" was in the paper. Stories included \"Tintin in the Congo\", \"Tintin in America\", \"The Broken Ear\", \"The Shooting Star\", and \"The Secret of the Unicorn\".\n\nAfter the war Julius Hoste Jr. regained control but the business needed to be rebuilt. He shared day-to-day management with Albert Maertens and Marcel Stijns became head editor. On 1 February 1954 Julius Hoste Jr. suddenly died. By means of an ingenious legal arrangement he ensured that the political heritage of his newspaper was guaranteed and the company was incorporated when he died. His heirs commissioned Albert Maertens to create a foundation specifically intended to safeguard the future political and editorial policy of the newspaper.\n\nOn 3 May 1955 the \"Stichting Het Laatste Nieuws\" (E: The Latest News Foundation) was set up. It included in its charter an explicit reference to the liberal declaration of Oxford, or Oxford Manifesto, which offered guarantees of editorial continuity for readers and journalists even in the event of the newspaper being sold. Frans Vink, the son-in-law of Julius Hoste Jr., headed the company; Albert Maertens helped to manage the structure of the company, and Marcel Stijns remained the head editor. A new company was created: the \"Uitgeverij J. Hoste NV\".\n\nWhen television broadcasting started in Belgium in 1954, the competitive environment became more challenging and the newspaper had to modernize its activity. The Antwerp-headquartered \"De Nieuwe Gazet\" was taken over, partially in 1957 and then completely in 1963. The foundation's business was expanded with the introduction of weekly magazines and a printing business. In order to finance the new ventures, negotiations were started with potential investors. Albert Maertens began talks with the Van Thillo family, the Flemish bankers based in Antwerp, who had shown a particular interest in Press investment.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s the Van Thillo family acquired more and more shares in the newspaper, but its editorial course remained in accordance with the principles articulated by the foundation. At the moment DPG Media is headed by Christian Van Thillo.\n\nIn the period of 1995-96 \"Het Laatste Nieuws\" had a circulation of 303,993 copies. The circulation of the paper was 287,000 copies in 2001. It was 341,257 copies in 2002. In 2003 its circulation was 294,000 copies, making it the best selling newspaper in Belgium.\n\nIn 2009 \"Het Laatste Nieuws\" had a circulation of 287,162 copies. The approximate circulation of the paper was 370,000 copies in 2010.\n\n\n"}

It was designed to replace the A-5C, F-7P/PG, Mirage III, and Mirage V combat aircraft in the Pakistan Air Force. The JF-17 can be used for multiple roles, including interception, ground attack, anti-ship, and aerial reconnaissance. Its designation \"JF-17\" by Pakistan is short for \"Joint Fighter-17\", while the designation and name \"FC-1 Xiaolong\" by China means \"Fighter China-1 Fierce Dragon\".\n\nThe JF-17 can deploy diverse ordnance, including air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, and a 23Â mm GSh-23-2 twin-barrel autocannon. Powered by a Guizhou WS-13 or Klimov RD-93 afterburning turbofan, it has a top speed of Mach 1.8. The JF-17 is to become the backbone of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), complementing the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon at half the cost. The PAF inducted its first JF-17 squadron in February 2010. In 2015 Pakistan produced 16 JF-17s. , Pakistan is believed to have the capacity to produce 25 JF-17 per year. 58% of the airframe is Pakistani and 42% Chinese/Russian-origin. Pakistan Aeronautical Complex has manufactured 70 jets in the country for use by the Pakistan Air Force of the Block 1 type, and 33 jets of the Block 2 type.\n\nThe Pakistan Air Force plans, by 2017, to induct a twin-seater version known as the JF-17B for both enhanced operational capability and training. Preparations for a more advanced and technologically sophisticated block III version of the aircraft are underway and the AESA radar, KJ-7A, has been developed, which can track 15 targets and engage 4 targets simultaneously.\n\nSince its induction in 2011, the JF-17 Thunder has accumulated 19,000 hours of operational flight. The JF-17 has seen active military service as it is used by the Pakistan Air Force to bomb militant positions in North Waziristan, using both unguided munitions and guided missiles for precision strike capability.\n\nThe JF-17 was primarily developed to meet the Pakistan Air Force requirement for an affordable, modern, multi-role combat aircraft as a replacement for its large fleet of Dassault Mirage III/5 fighters, Nanchang A-5 bombers, and Chengdu F-7 interceptors, with a cost of , divided equally between China and Pakistan. The aircraft was also intended to have export potential as a cost-effective and competitive alternative to more expensive Western fighters.<ref name=\"FC-1/JF-17, sinodefence.com\"></ref> The development of this aircraft was headed by Yang Wei, who is considered China's \"ace designer\". Yang also designed the Chengdu J-20.\n\nBy 1989, because of economic sanctions by the US, Pakistan had abandoned Project Sabre II, a design study involving US aircraft manufacturer Grumman and China, and had decided to redesign and upgrade the Chengdu F-7. In the same year, China and Grumman started a new design study to develop the Super 7, another redesigned Chengdu F-7. Grumman left the project when sanctions were placed on China following the political fallout from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. After Grumman left the Chengdu Super 7 project, the Fighter China project was launched in 1991. In 1995, Pakistan and China signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for joint design and development of a new fighter, and over the next few years worked out the project details. In June 1995, Mikoyan had joined the project to provide \"design support\", this also involved the secondment of several engineers by CAC.\n\nIn October 1995, Pakistan was reportedly to select a Western company by the end of the year to provide and integrate the FC-1's avionics, which was expected to go into production by 1999. The avionics were said to include radar, Inertial navigation system, Head-up display, and Multi-function displays. Competing bids came from Thomson-CSF with a variant of the Radar Doppler Multitarget (RDY), SAGEM with a similar avionics package to those used in the ROSE upgrade project, and Marconi Electronic Systems with its Blue Hawk radar. FIAR's (now SELEX Galileo) Grifo S7 radar was expected to be selected due to the company's ties with the PAF. In February 1998, Pakistan and China signed a letter of intent covering airframe development. Russia's Klimov offered a variant of the RD-33 turbofan engine to power the fighter.<ref name=\"04/03/98 flightglobal.com\"></ref> In April 1999, South Africa's Denel offered to arm the Super 7 with the T-darter beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile (AAM), rather than the previously reported R-Darter. Previously in 1987, Pratt & Whitney offered the Super-7 project three engine options; PW1212, F404, and PW1216, with local manufacturing in either China or Pakistan. Rolls Royce offered its RB199-127/128 turbofan engine; this plan was scrapped in 1989.\n\nIn June 1999, the contract to jointly develop and produce the Chengdu FC-1/Super 7 was signed. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated avionics suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of avionics suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar. Because of sanctions placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests, design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western avionics to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided to decouple the airframe from the avionics, enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the airframe was developed, any new avionics requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the air frame.\n\nPrototype production began in September 2002; a full-size mock-up of the FC-1/Super 7 was displayed at Airshow China in November 2002.<ref name=\"12/11/02 flightglobal.com\"></ref> The first batch of Klimov RD-93 turbofan engines that would power the prototypes was also delivered in 2002. According to a China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC) official, the JF-17's low cost is due to some of the on-board systems having been adapted from those of the Chengdu J-10. The official said, \"This transfer of technologytransposing the aircraft systems from the J-10 to the JF-17is what makes the JF-17 so cost-effective\". The use of computer-aided design software shortened the design phase of the JF-17.\n\nThe first prototype, PT-01, was rolled out on 31 May 2003 and transferred to the Chengdu Flight Test Centre to be prepared for its maiden flight. This was initially planned to take place in June, but was delayed due to concerns about the SARS outbreak. The designation Super-7 was replaced by \"JF-17\" (Joint Fighter-17) around this point. Low speed taxiing trials began at Wenjiang Airport, Chengdu, on 27 June 2003. The maiden flight was made in late August 2003; an official maiden flight of the prototype took place in early September. The prototype was marked with the new PAF designation JF-17. By March 2004, CAC had made around 20 test flights of the first prototype. On 7 April 2004, PAF test pilots Rashid Habib and Mohammad Ehsan ul-Haq flew PT-01 for the first time. The maiden flight of the third prototype, PT-03, took place on 9 April 2004. In March 2004, Pakistan was planning to induct around 200 aircraft.\n\nFollowing the third prototype, several design improvements were developed and incorporated into further aircraft. Because of excessive smoke emissions by the RD-93 engine, the air intakes were widened. Reported control problems found in testing resulted in alterations to the wing leading edge root extensions (LERX). The vertical tail fin was enlarged to house an expanded electronic warfare equipment bay in the tip. The redesigned aircraft had a slightly increased maximum take-off weight and incorporated an increased quantity of Chinese-sourced avionics; however PAF had selected Western avionics for their aircraft, postponing PAF deliveries from late 2005 until 2007. Pakistan evaluated British, French, and Italian avionics suites, the winner of which was expected to be finalised in 2006. PT-04, the fourth prototype and the first to incorporate the design changes, was rolled out in April 2006 and made its first flight on 28 April 2006.<ref name=\"08/05/06 flightglobal.com\"></ref>\n\nThe modified air intakes replaced conventional intake rampswhose function is to divert turbulent boundary layer airflow away from the inlet and prevent it entering the enginewith a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design. The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept inlet cowls and a three-dimensional compression surface to divert the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times the speed of sound, reduces weight by removing the need for complex mechanical intake mechanisms, and is stealthier than a conventional intake. In 1999, developmental work on the DSI with the aim of improving aircraft performance commenced. The JF-17 design was finalised in 2001. Multiple models underwent wind tunnel tests; it was found that the DSI reduced weight, cost, and complexity while improving performance.\n\nFor the avionics and weapons qualification phase of the flight testing, PT-04 was fitted with a fourth-generation avionics suite that incorporates sensor fusion, an electronic warfare suite, enhanced man-machine interface, Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC) for the RD-93 turbofan engine, FBW flight controls, day/night precision surface attack capability, and multi-mode, pulse-Doppler radar for BVR air-to-air attack capability. The sixth prototype, PT-06, made its maiden flight on 10 September 2006. Following a competition in 2008, Martin-Baker was selected over a Chinese firm for the supply of fifty PK16LE ejection seats.\n\nOn 2 March 2007, the first consignment of two small-batch-production (SBP) aircraft arrived in a dismantled state in Pakistan. They flew for the first time on 10 March 2007 and took part in a public aerial demonstration during a Pakistan Day parade on 23 March 2007. The PAF intended to induct 200 JF-17 by 2015 to replace all its Chengdu F-7, Nanchang A-5, and Dassault Mirage III/5 aircraft. In preparation for the in-flight refuelling of JF-17s, the PAF has upgraded several Mirage IIIs with IFR probes for training purposes. A dual-seat, combat-capable trainer was originally scheduled to begin flight testing in 2006; in 2009 Pakistan reportedly decided to develop the training model into a specialised attack variant.\n\nIn November 2007, the PAF and PAC conducted flight evaluations of aircraft fitted with a variant of the NRIET KLJ-10 radar developed by China's Nanjing Research Institute for Electronic Technology (NRIET), and the LETRI SD-10 active radar homing AAM. In 2005, PAC began manufacturing JF-17 components; production of sub-assemblies commenced on 22 January 2008. The PAF was to receive a further six pre-production aircraft in 2005, for a total of 8 out of an initial production run of 16 aircraft. Initial operating capability was to be achieved by the end of 2008. Final assembly of the JF-17 in Pakistan began on 30 June 2009; PAC expected to complete production of four to six aircraft that year. They planned to produce twelve aircraft in 2010 and fifteen to sixteen aircraft per year from 2011; this could increase to twenty-five aircraft per year.<ref name=\"01/07/09 flightglobal.com\"></ref> On 29 December 2015, Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) announced the rollout of the 16th JF-17 Thunder fighter manufactured in the calendar year 2015, taking total number of manufactured aircraft to more than 66. Later, a PAF spokesperson said that in light of the interest shown by various countries, it has been decided that production capacity of JF-17 Thunder at PAC Kamra will be expanded.\n\nRussia signed an agreement in August 2007 for re-export of 150 RD-93 engines from China to Pakistan for the JF-17. In 2008, the PAF reported it was not fully satisfied with the RD-93 engine and that it would only power the first 50 aircraft; it was alleged that arrangements for a new engine, reportedly the Snecma M53-P2, may have been made. Mikhail Pogosyan, head of the MiG and Sukhoi design bureaus, recommended the Russian defence export agency Rosoboronexport block RD-93 engine sales to China to prevent export competition from the JF-17 against the MiG-29. At the 2010 Farnborough Airshow, the JF-17 was displayed internationally for the first time; aerial displays at the show were intended but were cancelled due to a late attendance decision as well as license and insurance costs. According to a Rosoboronexport official at the Airshow China 2010, held on 16â21 November 2005 in Zhuhai, China, Russia and China had signed a contract worth $238 million for 100 RD-93 engines with options for another 400 engines developed for the FC-1.\n\nAccording to media reports, Pakistan planned to increase production of JF-17s by 25% in 2016.\n\nPakistan negotiated with British and Italian defence firms regarding avionics and radars for the JF-17 development. Radar options include the Italian Galileo Avionica's Grifo S7, the French Thomson-CSF's RC400 (a variant of the RDY-2), and the British company SELEX Galileo's Vixen 500E active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. In 2010, the PAF had reportedly selected ATE Aerospace Group to integrate French-built avionics and weapons systems over rival bids from Astrac, Finmeccanica and a Thales-Sagem joint venture. Fifty JF-17s were to be upgraded and an optional fifty from 2013 onwards, at a cost of up to . The RC-400 radar, MICA AAMs, and several air-to-surface weapons are believed to be in the contract. The PAF also held talks with South Africa for the supply of Denel A-darter AAMs.\n\nIn April 2010, after eighteen months of negotiations, the deal was reportedly suspended; reports cited French concerns about Pakistan's financial situation, the protection of sensitive French technology, and by Indian lobbying, which operates many French-built aircraft. France wanted the PAF to purchase several Mirage 2000-9 fighters from the United Arab Emirates Air Force, which would overlap with the upgraded JF-17. In July 2010, the PAF's Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman, said such reports were false, stating: \"I have had discussions with French Government officials who have assured me that this is not the position of their government...someone was trying to cause mischiefto put pressure on France not to supply the avionics we want\".\n\nOn 18 December 2013, production of Block 2 JF-17s began at PAC's Kamra facility. These have an air-to-air refuelling capability, improved avionics, enhanced load carrying capacity, data link, and electronic warfare capabilities. Block 2 construction is planned to run until 2016, after which the manufacturing of further developed Block III aircraft is planned. In December 2015, it was announced that the 16th Block II aircraft had been handed over resulting in standing up of the 4th squadron.\n\nOn 17 June 2015, Jane's Defence Weekly confirmed that JF-17 Block III will have an AESA radar, a helmet-mounted display (HMD) and possibly an internal infrared search and tracking (IRST) system. A two-seat version was also reportedly be produced in Block III. Unconfirmed reports claim that Block III will also have a better flight management system. Selex ES has promoted its next-generation cockpit as a possible upgrade of JF-17 Block III; this cockpit includes a new mission computer, an enhanced head-up display and contemporary multi-function displays, plus the capability for the pilot to use a single, large-area display instead.\n\nThe air frame is of semi-monocoque structure constructed primarily of aluminum alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The air frame is designed for a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the air frame to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position and shape of the inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during maneuvers involving high angles of attack.\n\nThe mid-mounted wings are of cropped-delta configuration. Near the wing root are the LERX, which generate a vortex that provides extra lift to the wing at high angles of attack encountered during combat maneuvers. A conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement is incorporated, with all-moving stabilators, single vertical stabiliser, rudder, and twin ventral fins. The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS of serial production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.\n\nThe glass cockpit is covered by a transparent, acrylic canopy that provides the pilot with a good, all-round field of view. It has three large Multifunction Colour Displays (MFD) and smart Heads-Up Display (HUD) with built-in symbol generation capability. A centre stick is used for pitch and roll control while rudder pedals control yaw. A throttle is located to the left of the pilot. The cockpit incorporates hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. The pilot sits on a Martin-Baker Mk-16LE zero-zero ejection seat. The cockpit incorporates an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and a wide-angle, holographic head-up display (HUD), which has a minimum total field of view of 25 degrees. The EFIS comprises three colour multi-function displays, providing basic flight information, tactical information, and information on the engine, fuel, electrical, hydraulics, flight control, and environment control systems. The HUD and MFD can be configured to show any available information. Each MFD is wide and tall and is arranged side by side in portrait orientation. The central MFD is placed lowest to accommodate a control panel between it and the HUD.\n\nUp to of ordnance, equipment, and fuel can be mounted under the hard points, two of which are on the wing-tips, four are under the wings and one is under the fuselage.\n\nThe avionics software incorporates the concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling the use of the numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic test equipment.\n\nThe JF-17 has a defensive aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite housed in a fairing at the tip of the tail fin interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors of missiles across a 360-degree coverage. Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A countermeasures dispensing system releases decoy flares and chaff to help evade hostile radar and missiles. The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a hardpoint.\n\nThe first forty-two PAF production aircraft are equipped with the NRIET KLJ-7 radar, a variant of the KLJ-10 radar developed by China's Nanjing Research Institute of Electronic Technology (NRIET) and also used on the Chengdu J-10. Multiple modes can manage the surveillance and engagement of up to forty air, ground, and sea targets; the track-while-scan mode can track up to ten targets at BVR and can engage two simultaneously with radar-homing AAMs. The operation range for targets with a radar cross-section (RCS) of is stated to be â¥ in look-up mode and â¥ in look-down mode. A forward looking infrared (FLIR) pod for low-level navigation and infra-red search and track (IRST) system for passive targeting can also be integrated; the JF-17 Block 2 is believed to incorporate an IRST.\n\nA helmet-mounted sight (HMS) developed by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC was developed in parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed to the public in 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centers, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.\n\nIn April 2016, Air Marshal Muhammad Ashfaque Arain said that, \"JF-17 needs a targeting pod, as the jets' usefulness in current operations was limited due to lack of precision targeting. To fulfill this gap the Air Force was interested in buying the Thales-made Damocles, a third-generation targeting pod; which was a priority.\" In 2017, Aselsan's ASELPOD was tested and successfully integrated with the JF-17 and Pakistan has subsequently purchased at least eight targeting pods from Aselsan. This integration has significantly enhanced the JF-17 platform's ability to launch precision strikes.\n\nThe first two blocks of JF-17 is powered by a single Russian RD-93 turbofan engine, which is a variant of the Klimov RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter. The engine gives more thrust and significantly lower specific fuel consumption than turbojet engines fitted to older combat aircraft being replaced by the JF-17. The advantages of using a single engine are a reduction in maintenance time and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters. A thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.99 can be achieved with full internal fuel tanks and no external payload. The engine's air supply is provided by two bifurcated air inlets (see airframe section).\n\nThe RD-93 is known to produce smoke trails. The Guizhou Aero Engine Group has been developing a new turbofan engine, the WS-13 \"Taishan\", since 2000 to replace the RD-93. It is based on the RD-33 and incorporates new technologies to boost performance and reliability. A thrust output of , a lifespan of 2,200 hours, and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.7 are expected. An improved version of the WS-13, developing a thrust of around (22,450Â lb), is also reportedly under development. During the 2015 Paris Air Show, it was announced that flight testing of a JF-17 equipped with the WS-13 engine had begun. In 2015, a representative of Pakistan Aeronautical Complex said that Pakistan would continue to use the RD-93 engine on their fighters. Local media reports in January 2016 said that Russia was planning to sell engines for JF-17 directly to Pakistan. According to a PAC representative, Pakistan is looking to collaborate with Russia in developing and repairing engines.\n\nThe fuel system comprises internal fuel tanks located in the wings and fuselage with a capacity of ; they are refuelled through a single point pressure refuelling system (see turbine fuel systems). Internal fuel storage can be supplemented by external fuel tanks. One drop tank can be mounted on the aircraft's centerline hard point under the fuselage and two 800-litre or drop tanks can be mounted on the two inboard under-wing hardpoints. The fuel system is compatible with in-flight refueling (IFR), allowing tanker aircraft to refuel inflight, and increasing its range and loitering time significantly. All production aircraft for the PAF are to be fitted with IFR probes. In June 2013, PAF Air Chief Marshal Tahir Rafique Butt said ground tests on the JF-17's refueling probes had been successfully completed and the first mid-air refuelling operations would commence that summer.\n\nThe JF-17 can be armed with up to of air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry, and other equipment mounted externally on the aircraft's seven hardpoints. One hardpoint is located under the fuselage between the main landing gear, two are underneath each wing, and one is at each wing-tip. All seven hardpoints communicate via a MIL-STD-1760 data-bus architecture with the Stores Management System, which is stated to be capable of integration with weaponry of any origin. Internal armament comprises one GSh-23-2 twin-barrel cannon mounted under the port side air intake, which can be replaced with a GSh-30-2 twin-barrel cannon.\nThe wing-tip hard-points are typically occupied by short range infra-red homing AAMs. Many combinations of ordnance and equipment such as targeting pods can be carried on the under-wing and under-fuselage hard-points. Underwing hard-points can be fitted with multiple ejector racks, allowing each hard-point to carry two unguided bombs or LGBsMk.82 or GBU-12. It is unknown whether multiple ejector racks can be used for ordnance such as beyond visual range (BVR) AAMs. Active radar homing BVR AAMs can be integrated with the radar and data-link for mid-course updates. The Chinese PL-12/SD-10 is expected to be the aircraft's primary BVR air-to-air weapon, although this may change if radars of other origin are fitted. Short range, infra-red homing missiles include the Chinese PL-5E and PL-9C. The PAF is also seeking to arm the JF-17 with a fifth generation close-combat missile such as the PL10E IRIS-T or A-Darter. These will be integrated with the HMS/D and the radar for targeting.\n\nUnguided air-to-ground weaponry includes rocket pods, gravity bombs and Matra Durandal anti-runway munitions. Precision-guided munitions such as LGBs and satellite-guided bombs are also compatible with the JF-17, as are other guided weapons such as anti-ship missiles and anti-radiation missiles. Pakistan planned to bring the Brazilian MAR-1 anti-radiation missile into service on its JF-17 fleet in 2014.\n\nSmall batch production of the single-seat, single-engine JF-17s began in China in June 2006. The first two small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered on 2 March 2007 and first flew in Pakistan on 10 March. They took part in an aerial display on 23 March 2007 as part of the Pakistan Day Joint Services Parade in Islamabad. Another six small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered by March 2008. These were extensively flight-tested and evaluated by the PAF. Two serial production aircraft were delivered from China in 2009 and the first Pakistani-manufactured aircraft was delivered to the PAF in a ceremony on 23 November 2009.\n\nOn 18 February 2010, the first JF-17 squadron, No. 26 \"Black Spiders\", was officially inducted into the PAF with an initial strength of 14 fighter planes. These aircraft first saw service in the anti-terrorist operation in South Waziristan, during which various types of weapons were evaluated. They took part in the PAF's \"High Mark 2010\" exercise from 29 April, where they were used by the \"Blue Force\" to attack \"Red Land\" surface targets with precision air-to-surface weapons. A re-equipment ceremony for No. 26 \"Black Spiders\" Squadron took place on 11 April 2011, during which it was stated that the JF-17 had \"revolutionized the PAF's operational concepts\". The then Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman said: \"Today as we re-equip No 26 squadron, we have also raised No. 16 Squadron with the JF-17 Thunder aircraft. I would like to mention and appreciate the contribution and support of the Chinese in helping us acquire a technological breakthrough in the shape of this aircraft.\" According to Pakistani forums, No 27 Squadron \"Zarrars\" replaced its Mirage 5EF with JF-17 in 2013. No 2 Squadron currently tasked with sea strikes reequipped with JF-17s in Sept 2015 replacing the F7s. No 16 Squadron \"Black Panthers\" has also been equipped with the JF-17. The next squadron is supposed to be No 7 Squadron.\nOn 14 November 2011, at Kamra air base, one PAF JF-17 crashed, killing the pilot.\nOn 27 September 2016, one PAF JF-17 crashed into the Arabian sea, the pilot ejecting safely.\nOn 19 June 2017, it was reported that a JF-17 shot down an Iranian UAV operating in Pakistan's Pangjur District.\n\nOn 27 February 2019, during the tense standoff between India and Pakistan, Pakistan claimed that its JF-17s had shot down two Indian aircraft: a Mig-21 and a Su-30MKI, operating in Pakistan's airspace over the disputed region of Kashmir. India, on the other hand, claimed to have shot down a Pakistani F-16, while losing a MiG-21 in the aerial engagement. India denied the loss of any Su-30MKI and stated that all aircraft returned safely, whereas Pakistan denied the use or loss of any F-16 during the stand-off.\n\nIn December 2014, during the International Defence Exhibition and Seminar in Karachi, Nigeria was reportedly buying between 25 and 40 JF-17s from Pakistan. Nigerian Air Force chief Air Marshal Adesola Nunayon Amosu had visited Pakistan earlier in October 2014. Nigeria became the second customer in 2016 by placing an order for 3 planes. However, as the news reports value the deal at US$25 million, it is not clear if the item is misreported. A June 2016 article in Jane's re-affirmed NAF budget for 3 JF-17, 10 Super Mushshak, and 2 Mi-35M aircraft in 2016. According to Indian media, a deal to buy JF-17s might be signed in November with a MoU already signed.\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force has confirmed it is expecting delivery of JF-17 for use in military operations against Jihadi militants in Northern Nigeria.\n\nIn October 2018 Pakistan approved of the sale and local Nigerian production of three JF-17s for US$184.3 million. The aircraft are rumored to be of a later version than the initially agreed sale, providing more advanced systems.\n\nOn 17 December 2018, Jane's disclosed that the Myanmar Air Force had received the first of up to 16 JF-17s it had ordered in 2015.\n\nVarious countries including Algeria, Ukraine, Argentina, Bulgaria, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, South Africa and Uruguay have shown interest in the JF-17.\n\nThe Azerbaijani Air Forces negotiated with China for several dozen JF-17s worth approximately each. The Sudanese Air Force was reportedly negotiating to buy twelve aircraft. The Air Force of Zimbabwe reportedly planned to purchase twelve JF-17s in 2004, as part of a $240 million deal with China. No such sales have materialized. In 2010, China was reportedly in talks about the JF-17 with five or six countries, some of which had sent pilots to China to undergo test flights.\n\nArgentine officials at the 2013 Paris Air Show said they had discussed JF-17 co-production with Chinese officials, calling it the first formal effort potentially leading to the co-production of a modern Chinese fighter in Latin America. FÃ¡brica Argentina de Aviones (FAdeA) officials said the co-produced FC-1 could be called the \"Pulqui-III\", recalling FAdeA's Pulqui-II, Latin America's first swept wing jet fighter. On 15 February 2015, after a three-day visit to Beijing by Argentine president Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, Argentina completed negotiations to purchase twenty FC-1s from Chengdu Aircraft Corporation.\n\nIn January 2014, the Royal Saudi Air Force was reportedly examining potential technology transfer and co-production opportunities for the JF-17. Saudi Defence Minister Prince Salman bin Sultan toured the JF-17 project during a visit to Pakistan.\n\nIn June 2015, Pakistani media suggested that an export order had been confirmed with the Sri Lanka Air Force; claims were made that the JF-17's first sales contract had been signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force at the 51st Paris Air Show. Other sources claimed that Myanmar is the first buyer of Pakistani JF-17s. Reportedly, the order would cover around 18â24 aircraft and deliveries set to begin in 2017. During a state visit by Nawaz Sharif in January 2016, Sri Lanka reportedly signed an agreement to buy eight JF-17s from Pakistan; however, the Sri Lankan government has issued denials. The alleged deal was said to involve 10â12 aircraft, each valued at US$35 million, for a total of US$400 million Reportedly, any such sale was scuppered by Indian diplomatic pressure.\n\nMorocco has shown interest in the JF-17, having invited a sales team to showcase it in the Marrakech Air Show 2016. According to a local analyst, a potential acquisition by Morocco may be complicated by incompatible technologies; the JF-17 Block I and Block II have broadly different electronics suites and air-to-air & air-to-surface munitions than its current Western-sourced aircraft, such as the Mirage F-1 (MF2000), F-5E/F Tiger II and Alpha Jet.\n\nTwo air frame configurations were tested during the prototype stage. The first configuration was tested on the first three prototype aircraft; PT-01, PT-02, and PT-03. The next three prototypes PT-04, PT-05, and PT-06 were of the second configuration, incorporating modifications such as DSI, wider LERX, extended ventral fins, and a taller, less swept vertical stabilizer with a rectangular fairing at the tip containing electronic warfare equipment and small blister fairings at the base containing Missile Approach Warning sensors. The PT-04 prototype was primarily used for avionics and weapon qualification tests. Prototype-01 first flew in August 2003; Prototype-03 followed in April 2004. On 10 May 2006, Prototype 04 made its maiden flight.\n\nIn 2007, a dual-seat version for training and strike roles was proposed and due to the customer interests the development started in 2015. According to the PAF, the JF-17B dual seat fighter jet is currently entering the testing phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Everett Turnpike, also called the Central New Hampshire Turnpike, is a toll road in the U.S. state of New Hampshire, running from the Massachusetts border at Nashua north to Concord. The Everett Turnpike is named for Frederick Elwin Everett, the first Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Transportation.\n\nThe turnpike is part of the New Hampshire Turnpike System, and is operated by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation's Bureau of Turnpikes. There are two tolled sections, a southern one in Merrimack and Bedford and a northern tolled section in Hooksett; the remainder of the turnpike is toll-free. Each of the tolled segments cost a maximum of $1.00 for passenger cars passing through the mainline tollbooths, with lower rates charged on the ramp tolls for traveling shorter distances. A 30% discount is also offered for users of the E-ZPass electronic toll system.\n\nMuch of the turnpike's length has been overlapped by other numbered routes. Portions of the road are shared with US-3, I-93, and I-293. The southern portion of the turnpike, in Nashua, is posted as US-3, serving as an extension of the US-3 freeway (Northwest Expressway) from Burlington, Massachusetts. North of Exit 7 in Nashua, the turnpike runs by itself and has no number, but parallels US-3, which is a toll-free local road variously known as Concord Street (within the city of Nashua) and the Daniel Webster Highway (within Merrimack and Bedford). Approaching Bedford in the Manchester area, the turnpike is joined by I-293 which splits off from a concurrency with NH-101. At Exit 4 (exits are numbered for I-293 on this stretch), NH-3A joins the freeway, and the concurrency passes through Manchester, near the downtown area of the city. Upon passing Manchester, Route 3A splits off at Exit 7, I-293's last northbound exit. The freeway passes into Hooksett, and I-293 ends at an interchange with I-93. The Everett Turnpike ceases to be signed at this interchange, but joins I-93 northbound and continues towards Concord, interchanging with the southern terminus of I-89 along the way. No definitive northern terminus for the turnpike exists as far as signage is concerned. This endpoint was originally at a traffic circle next to downtown Concord that has since been replaced by Exit 14 with NH-9.\n\nThere are two mainline toll plazas on the turnpike, in Bedford and Hooksett, that each charge $1.00 in cash. The Bedford mainline toll plaza, located between Exit 13 and I-293, replaced the Merrimack toll plaza (formerly located at what is now Exit 11) in the early 1990s. Ramp tolls also exist at Exit 10 in Merrimack and I-93 Exit 11 at the mainline toll plaza in Hooksett. E-ZPass readers were installed in all toll locations in 2005, and the state currently offers a 30% discount for using it. Major rest areas combined with state-run liquor stores are located on either side of the highway in Hooksett just north of the mainline toll plaza on I-93. On July 18, 2014, the Exit 12 ramp tolls in Merrimack were removed, and on January 1, 2020, the Merrimack Exit 11 ramp tolls were removed.\n\nThe proposed (but mostly unbuilt) Circumferential Highway around the east side of Nashua is defined as part of the turnpike. Henri A. Burque Highway, the surface road that US-3 uses to get between exit 7 of the turnpike and the Daniel Webster Highway in northern Nashua, is also part of it.\n\nShields for the Everett Turnpike consist of a rectangle with a rounded bottom, a green circle, and green text that says \"Everett Turnpike\" above the circle, with the word \"Turnpike\" curved along the top edge of the circle; this signage is similar in design to that for other New Hampshire turnpikes. For the US 3 segment in Nashua, there is an Everett Turnpike sign in Massachusetts just south of the border northbound alongside the US 3 shield on an overhead sign, and several others along overhead signs through Nashua. Mile markers also contain the Everett Turnpike shield in Nashua, and combined US 3 and Everett Turnpike shields are posted along the side of the road on stand-alone posts, though most on-ramp signage only indicates US 3. \n\nSigns for the turnpike are most prominent on the Merrimack-Bedford segment which lacks any concurrent US or Interstate route. Along this section, the Everett Turnpike shield appears on on-ramp direction signs, along the side of the highway on signposts, and on overhead reassurance signs.\n\nAlong the I-293 segment in Manchester, signage is similar to the Nashua US 3 section, though mile markers have the I-293 shield instead of the Everett Turnpike shield.\n\nThough the Turnpike continues north to Concord, it is not signed north of the I-293 merge in Hooksett. On I-93 North, the exit for I-293 is signed as I-293/Everett Turnpike South, while the mainline is signed as \"I-93 North (a toll road)\". On I-293 North, Everett Turnpike signs stop at the merge, with I-93 North signed by itself. There is no indication of the northern terminus on I-93 in either direction. Southbound, the first emergence of Turnpike signage is after the exit onto I-293. The sole mention of the Everett Turnpike north of the I-293 merge is on New Hampshire Route 3A at the intersection with Hackett Hill Road leading to exit 11 in Hooksett. A sign with the Turnpike and I-93 shields notes the highway as leading north to Concord and south to Manchester. North of Exit 11, there are no Turnpike signs on intersecting highways, including I-89.\n\nThere are Turnpike mile markers only from the Massachusetts state line to the interchange with I-293 and Route 101. North of there, the mile markers and sequential exit numbers relate to the concurrent Interstate highways.\n\nPrior to the September 11, 2001 attacks, exit 4 in Nashua was signed as \"East Dunstable Road / FAA Center.\" The \"FAA Center\" signage was removed at the request of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\n"}

QSound was eventually re-dubbed \"Q1\" after the introduction of \"Q2\", a positional 3D algorithm for headphones. Later multi-speaker surround system support was added to the positional 3D process, the QSound positional 3D audio process became known simply as \"Q3D\". QSound was founded by Larry Ryckman (CEO), Danny Lowe and John Lees. Jimmy Iovine served as SVP of Music and Shelly Yakus as VP of Audio Engineering in its formative years.\n\nQSound is essentially a filtering algorithm. It manipulates timing, amplitude and frequency response to produce a binaural image. Systems like QSound rely on the fact that a sound arriving from one side of the listener will reach one ear before the other and that when it reaches the furthest ear, it is lower in amplitude and spectrally altered due to obstruction by the head. However, the ideal algorithm was arrived at empirically, with parameters adjusted according to the outcomes of many listening tests.\n\n3D positional processing like QSound, the multi-channel QSystem professional processor used in the production of pop music and film audio, is distinct from stereo expansion like QSound QXpander or SRS(R) Sound Retrieval System. Positional 3D audio processing is a producer-side technology. It is applied to individual instruments or sound effects, and is therefore only usable at the mixing phase of music and soundtrack production, or under realtime control of game audio mixing software. Stereo expansion (processing of recorded channels and background ambience) is primarily a playback process that can be arbitrarily applied to stereo content in the end-user environment using analog integrated circuits or digital signal processing (DSP) routines.\n\nThe system was used in all Capcom CP System Dash, CP System II titles as well as several console games and the Sony ZN-1 and ZN-2 hardware arcade games such as \"Battle Arena Toshinden 2\".\n\nQSound was utilized on Sting's 1991 album, \"The Soul Cages\", Madonna's 1990 album, \"The Immaculate Collection\", and Paula Abdul's 1991 album, \"Spellbound\".\n\nElectronic Arts, Activision, Microsoft Game Studios, Sega, Virgin Interactive, TDK Mediactive, Bullfrog Productions, and Lionhead Studios have also used the technology, mostly through the use of the QMixer software development kit to implement audio positioning, mixing and control directly in the game software. Later versions of QMixer added support for 3D-accelerated hardware through the low-level Microsoft DirectSound3D Application Programming Interface.\n\nQ3D has been incorporated in a variety of computer sound cards and sound card drivers.\n\nWhile the system is known by some for its use in video game titles, the first QSound chip used for that purpose was not created until 1991, while QSound had been developed in the late 1980s and has been used in everything from screensavers to television programming. Some TVs were also produced with this technology. Several 1990s music albums were also \"mixed in QSound\" (see below) using the QSystem or QSystem II hardware processors, and many other music releases have been enhanced with QSound effects using software plug-in versions of the QSystem and other software utilities. (The QSound website maintains a list of known projects.)\n\nIn 2003, Q3D was added to the list of components in QSound Labs' microQ, a small-footprint, performance-optimized software digital audio engine aimed at the mobile market (i.e. cellphones and the like). Q3D enables 3D sound for handheld gaming and can be controlled in Java games via the JSR-234 application programming interface.\n\nQSound won \"Electronic Entertainment\"s 1993 \"Most Promising\" award; the editors called it the \"hottest new audio technology around\".\n\nNotable games include:\nOver 60 albums feature QSound processing.

{"id": "1928589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928589", "title": "Derivatization", "text": "Derivatization\n\nDerivatization is a technique used in chemistry which converts a chemical compound into a product (the reaction's derivate) of similar chemical structure, called a derivative.\n\nGenerally, a specific functional group of the compound participates in the derivatization reaction and transforms the educt to a derivate of deviating reactivity, solubility, boiling point, melting point, aggregate state, or chemical composition. Resulting new chemical properties can be used for quantification or separation of the educt.\n\nDerivatization techniques are frequently employed in chemical analysis of mixtures and in surface analysis, e.g. in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy where newly incorporated atoms label characteristic groups.\n\nSeveral characteristics are desirable for a derivatization reaction:\n\nSome examples of good derivatization reactions are the formation of esters and amides via acyl chlorides.\n\nClassical qualitative organic analysis usually involves reacting an unknown sample with various reagents; a positive test usually involves a change in appearance â color, precipitation, etc.\n\nThese tests may be extended to give sub-gram scale products. These products may be purified by recrystallization, and their melting points taken. An example is the formation of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones from ketones and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.\n\nBy consulting an appropriate reference table such as in Vogel's, the identity of the starting material may be deduced. The use of derivatives has traditionally been used to determine or confirm the identity of an unknown substance. However, due to the wide range of chemical compounds now known, it is unrealistic for these tables to be exhaustive. Modern spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques have made this technique obsolete for all but pedagogical purposes.\n\nPolar N-H and O-H groups on which give hydrogen bonding may be converted to relatively nonpolar groups on a relatively nonvolatile compound. The resultant product may be less polar, thus more volatile, allowing analysis by gas chromatography. Bulky, nonpolar silyl groups are often used for this purpose. \n\nChiral derivatizing agents react with enantiomers to give diastereomers. Since diastereomers have different physical properties, they may be further analyzed by HPLC and NMR spectroscopy.\n"}

He lost his belt to Thai Somsak Sithchatchawal on 18 May 2006, in a match that won \"The Ring\" Fight of the Year and the Boxing Writers Association of America's \"Fight of the Year\" known as the Harry Markson Award.\n\nAt age 11, due to the start of the IranâIraq War, his father sent him to Poitiers, France with his aunt Mahnaz. After his minor amateur career, Mayhar Monshipour turned professional on October 26, 1996 by knocking out Karim Azagzaoui during the 6th round in a rather rough fight. He then went on to win 5 consecutive matches, all ending in knockouts. At the time, his style was already that of a slugger, but he started boxing on his opponents without protecting himself and his only technique was to âjump headlongâ. In December 1997, he fought the Congolese Euloge Makiza Sita (8 wins and 2 losses). Monshipour showed to be stronger but made the mistake of not protecting himself. Being the more powerful fighter, he sent Sita to the mat twice causing Sita to lose points.\n\nMayhar Monshipour found victory once again by beating Medhi Path in seconds. This victory was a new personal record for Mayhar because it was the only time he got a KO in the first round. After another victory, he goes on to fight the Hungarian Sandor hope Koczak (7 fights, 7 wins). From the 1st round Monshipour is dominant and sends him to the mat. But in the second round, Koczak elbows Monshipour in the eye. Not only was Koczak not sanctioned, but Monshipour stopped the fight in the third round for the broad caused injury.\n\nFrom that defeat, Monshipour will later experience an unbeaten 8 years. He obtained 8 wins (5 KO).\n\nHis style later changed: Mahyar would still advance on his opponents but became a more technical slugger. He would dodge blows while also dealing out attacks to the body never yielding an inch to his opponents. The first to confront this is the British, Michael Adlis who exhausted by the roller abandoned the fight in the fourth round. On January 18, 2002, he won the title Champion of France super bantamweight by knocking out Salem Bouaita in the 9th round. He defended his title once again against Frederick Bonifai (this will be his last win on points). On September 13, 2002 he acquired the European title against the Franco- Turkish Tuncay Kaya in just 6 rounds. He retains this title two times against Mustapha Hame (KO in the 6th round) and GermÃ¡n Guartos (KO in the 3rd round).\n\nOn July 4, 2003, Mahyar Monshipour applied for a first world title match. He faces a friend, the world champion super bantamweight WBA Salim Medjkoune at Futuroscope in Poitiers. True to his promise, Monshipour put up a fight from the very beginning, The fight was transforming rapidly into a real war, between two men going blow for blow. In the last round, the challenger Mahyar Monshipour (leading Salim Medjkoune to two of the three judges, 107-102 and 106-104 to 104-104) continues the pace. With a right hook to the chin that abruptly ended the fight after 1 minute and 27 seconds, Medjkoune heavily collapses to the ground and remained there for several minutes before getting up to the cheers of 4,300 spectators that were relieved for his well being. Monshipour became the new world champion WBA.\n\nSoon after his story inspired television and he becomes one of the few French boxers to be invited to boxing debates. He created in 2003 the association France-Bam to help the Iranians to Bam.\n\nOn December 16, 2003, he defended his title for the first time against Jairo Tagliaferro, a hard to fight Venezuelan, Monshipour forced him down in the 8th recovery.\n\nHe later faces Medjkoune for a second time. After a good start to the fight, Salim Medjkoune was gradually worn down by the wide hooks of the titleholder. Having proved himself once in the 5th round, he resumed the 7th round exhausted. But the end was coming as a right hook to the body sends down Salim Medjkoune in the 8th round. After an eight count by the referee, Medjkoune continues the battle to later return to the ground and his corner threw in the towel.\n\nMonshipour still defends his title two more times before facing Shigeru Nakazato, a boxer who had unsuccessfully tried twice to take a world title. From the initial sound of the bell, Nakazato suddenly advanced on the defending champion. Both boxers had similar attributes but the power, vitality and precision of the French boxer will give him the advantage. With a right hook in the third round, will eventually prove be too much for the Japanese, bringing him down shortly. During the sixth round, a right from Monshipour shakes Nakazato. Moments later, another right sends him to the mat, this time for the count.\n\nIn 2005 (during his last victory), he confronts a former champion: Julio ZÃ¡rate . Mahyar went into a fight against an opponent who truly came to win. Against all odds, the lanky Mexican chooses to attack from the start, and surprised the defending champion several times, especially with very good uppercuts to the body and face. In the 4th round, after a chain of left and right hooks Monshipour gets hit in the chin and collapses to the mat. He continues the battle and manages to reach the end of the round. Mid fight, the situation gets difficult for the Poitevin who is three points behind. But due to counting his physical and fabulous will Monshipour makes a comeback. From the seventh round, the juggernaut starts suffocating ZÃ¡rate who uses other resources including his head to try to slow the advance of Monshipour. ZÃ¡rate will receive two warnings (7th and 8th rounds) before giving up the appeal in the 9th round.\n\nOn March 18, 2006, in Levallois-Perret, Monshipour defended his belt for the sixth time, this time against the Thai Somsak Sithchatchawal. True to his simple tactic of demolishing opponents, the Poitevin seeks victory. Exhausted, and gasping for air, he was defeated by a boxer who proved ultimately more lucid. Knocked down early on, Monshipour was nevertheless able to make up ground. But he never managed to bend his opponent. A terrible counter in the 6th recovery had seriously shaken the Frenchman. In the 9th and 10th round, Somsak Sithchatchawal threw a barrage of shots that prompted the referee to end the fight.\n\nMonshipour decided to end his career after this fight.\n\nThis fight of a rare intensity, is crowned fight of the year 2006, even though defeated he still receives this distinction, This is the third time a Frenchman, after Georges Carpentier in 1924 and in 1950 Laurent Dauthuille has won this honour.\n\nOn October 8, 2008, Monshipour announced his comeback two and a half years after his last fight. On December 1, 2008, he beat Emiliano Salvini by disqualification during the 6th round and defeated Sean Hughes by referee stoppage in the 8th round on January 24, 2009 and defeated Felix Machado March 13, 2009 by abandoning the call of the 5th round. On July 4, 2009, he faces world title WBA of bantamweight reigning champion Anselmo Moreno but lost points in Poitiers.\n\n\n\nLa rage d'Ãªtre FranÃ§ais, Grasset, 2007 ()\n\n"}

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of \"Systema Naturae\". It is found throughout the Palearctic region and the Near East and is one of the most common members of the family in the region. It is distinctive due to its habit of resting with its hindwings held further forward than (but still half hidden by) the forewings. \n\nAdults may be seen from May to September, and do not feed, not having a functional proboscis, and can vary in colour from grey to yellow. The larva is green, feeds on poplar and some other tree species, and pupates below ground.\n\nThis is a large (wingspan 70â100Â mm), odd-looking, species due to its habit of resting with its hindwings held further forward than (but still half hidden by) the forewings (the species lacks a frenulum joining the wings together). It is said to look like a cluster of dead leaves of the main host, poplar.\n\nWhen disturbed, the moth will suddenly reveal a bright orange-red basal patch on the hindwing, possibly as a distraction or startle display. The wings are grey marked with darker grey fascia but with the greys occasionally replaced by buffish tones (this form is more frequent among females than males). There is a white spot at the distal edge of the cell on the forewings.\n\nGynandromorphs, half female and half male, are common.\n\nPoplar hawk-moths have been known to produce a hybrid when mated with the eyed hawkmoth, \"Smerinthus ocellatus\"; the hybrid has eyes on the hindwings.\nOne or two broods are produced each year and adults can be seen from May to September. The adults do not feed. The species overwinters as a pupa.\n\nThe egg is large, spherical, pale green, and glossy, and is laid singly or in pairs on the underside of leaves of the host plant. Females lay up to 200 eggs.\n\nOn first hatching the larva (or \"hornworm\") is pale green with small yellow tubercules and a cream-coloured tail horn. Later, it develops yellow diagonal stripes on its sides, and pink spiracles. Individuals feeding on willows may become quite heavily spotted with red. Others are more bluish white with cream stripes and tubercules. They are stout bodied, and grow to 65â85Â mm.\n\nThe larva pupates in an earthen cell 2â3Â cm below the surface, near its host plant. It has a short cremaster.\n\nAlthough they emerge late at night or early in the morning, the moth flies starting from the second night and is strongly attracted to light. Having no functional proboscis, it does not feed. The adults drink nectar.\n\nIt feeds mainly on poplar and aspen but sometimes on willow, alder, apple, tomato, birch, elm, oak and ash. The food plant often depends on location.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the north east of the Region of Murcia, close to the towns of Cieza and Yecla. According to the 2018 census, the town population was 25,547.\n\nThe municipality, located in the north of the Region of Murcia, covers . It shares borders with the municipality of Yecla at its northeast and its east; with AbarÃ¡n, Fortuna and Cieza at its south and with Abanilla at its east. It also adjoins the province of Albacete in the autonomous community CastillaâLa Mancha at its west and the province of Alicante in the autonomous community Valencian Community.\n\nIn this municipality there are several mountain landforms. There are three which are specially noteworthy in the territory and these are Sierra del Carche, Sierra del Buey and Sierra de la Pila. Other geographical elements that occupy the territory are three salt evaporation ponds.In regards to water landforms, there are not any basin with permanent water flow, but there are three \"ramblas\" or \"arroyos\" (creeks).\n\nThe inhabitants of the municipality are distributed in the following localities: Jumilla, where 24,416 people live; La Estacada, where there are 284 residents; Fuente del Pino, which is located in the northern half and is home to 125 people; CaÃ±ada del Trigo, which is located in the southeast of Jumilla and has a population of 121; Torre del Rico, which is placed in the southeast of the municipality and is occupied by 106 residents; El Carche, which is placed in the east of the territory and occupied by 8 residents; La AlquerÃ­a, with a population of 155 and Las Encebras, which is located in the southern half and is home to 45 people.\n\nThis current municipality was populated in the Lower Paleolithic, 450,000 years ago. Remains of human presence in the Upper and Middle Paleolithic were discovered in the same spot as the Lower Paleolithic ones. These have a date of the 80,000 BC.\n\nThere is also evidence of human presence in the Epipaleolithic in this territory and it consists in the archaeological sites.\n\nIn regards to the Chalcolithic in this current municipality, ruins of an ancient hamlet are the trace of the people living in that era. The archaeological site is named El Prado and it has a distance of 3Â km from the town Jumilla. This hamlet was inhabited by 300 people and its dwellings consisted in husts formed with reed and mud adobe.\n\nThere is a cave in this current municipality which had a sacred purpose for these people 5,000 years ago. In that spot burial sites had been discovered.\n\nThe Bronze Age (1900 BC - 900 BC in Region of Murcia) was an important period for Jumilla and this statement is based in the fact that a relevant quantity of hamlets of this era were found with some archaeological operations.\n\nIn the 3rd century BC the Phoenicians of Carthage colonised a large part of the Iberian Peninsula: from the current town CÃ¡diz to the Ebro River. A war in which the Roman Republica side and the Carthaginian side were involved took place and its name is the Second Punic War. In this war the Roman side was the winner and as a consequence the territory which had been under Carthaginian control were conquered by the Romans.\n\nAs a result of these facts, Jumilla became Roman territory and its farming lands were divided up among legionnaires. Remains of Ancient Roman presence in Jumillaare the roman villas ruins, which are part of the landscape of the municipality. Some remarkable remains are a bronze statuette of the god Hypos and some mosaiscs from a former Roman villa.\n\nThere is a trace element from the 5th century AD (Late antiquity) and it consists in a funerary structure.\n\nIn the year 711 AD, Berbers and Arabs entered in the Iberian Peninsula and conquered a large portion of it. Approximately the area of the current Region of Murcia became to be under Adb's Al-Aziz power. The Abd's Al-Aziz troops circulated through Jumilla territory. The Muslims used previous built fortifications for erecting their fortress.\n\nIn the mid-13th century, the king of the Taifa of Murcia Aben Hud was menaced by the Castillian troops and by the monarch of the Emirate of Granada Aben Almahar. The king of the Taifa of Murcia reached an agreement with the prince Alfonso X of Castile, who would be king.In this deal issues such as respecting the inhabitants lives and possessions were agreed.\n\nAlfonso X of Castile visited Jumilla when he was king. He decided to get the Church of Santa MarÃ­a de Gracia built and nowadays a part of the church is still preserved.\n\nAfter the death of Alfonso X, there were dispuets for reigning. The Crown of Aragon took advantage of that situation - It broke out a war against the Crown of Castile and invaded the Kingdom of Murcia. Jumilla was conquered in the late 13th century or in the early 14th century. It was during under the Crown of Aragon Control era when the first historic document which address solely Jumilla was written. The document was about demarcating lands and municipality with boundary markers.\n\nIn the mid 14th century, when Jumilla was under the Crown of Aragon power, this town became a border locality. As a consequence, Jumilla must have been ruled with a man having an iron fist. Consequently, the inhabitants asked the king Peter of Castile for help in order to live in territory which belonged again to the Crown of Castile. Frederik of Castile, who was son of the king Ferdinand III of Castile, caused Jumilla to belong to the Crown of Castile again in the year 1357.\n\nTwo of the first important facts in Jumilla were the French invasion and the resulting Peninsular War. Jumilla plunged into the war and its inhabitants established the military defence junta.\n\nJumilla's economy is based on agriculture with main cultivation being vineyards, olive trees and fruit trees.\n\nJumilla is home to a large photovoltaic solar power farm, with an installed peak power capacity of 20 megawatts. The solar farm consists of 120,000 solar panels and covers . The farm's total annual production will be the equivalent of the energy used by 20,000 homes. The solar panels are owned by groups of investors. It is expected to generate an estimated annual income of $28 million (â¬19 million) and a reduction in CO2 emissions of 42,000 tons a year. Powerlight provided single-axis solar trackers to improve the system's performance.\n\nJumilla, together with neighboring Yecla, is one of the primary regions for development of the Murciana and Granadina breeds of dairy goats. Jumilla is also a wine-producing region famous for its Carta Roja wines. Jumilla's wine production and culture are particularly notable for its use of the Monastrell grape as a varietal.\n\nSome buildings that have special culture values such as historic or artistic are shown below:\n\n\nThe festivities held in the municipality are shown below:\n\n\n\n<BR>\n"}

There are two Jewish full fast days:\n\n\nThe two full fast days carry four restrictions in addition to eating and drinking - one may not wash his body, wear leather shoes, use colognes, oils or perfumes, or have sexual relations. Yom Kippur also has all the restrictions of Shabbat, and Tisha B'Av has restrictions somewhat similar to a mourner sitting \"shiva\".\n\nThe Halakha status of the two Jewish full fasts is that they are obligatory.\n\nMinor fasts are observed from dawn to nightfall, without additional restrictions. There are four public minor fasts:\n\n\nThree of the four minor fasts (all but the Fast of Esther) are mentioned in the Bible as fasts in memory of the destruction of the First Temple. However, after the Second Temple was built, these fasts ceased to be observed. The Talmud establishes general rules for observance of the fasts in later periods: if the Temple stands the fasts are not observed; if the Jewish people is being persecuted the fasts are observed; if neither of those is the case, then \"should they desire, they fast, should they desire not to, they do not fast.\" Nowadays, the Jewish people are accustomed to observing these fasts, making them obligatory.\n\nThere are four Jewish fast that exist, in all or in part, in commemoration of events having to do with the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple:\n\n\nCustomary fasts are practiced by specific communities, or by especially pious individuals, or by certain classes of individuals.\n\n\nCustomarily, special prayers called selichot are added in the morning prayer services on many of these days.\n\nA break the fast is a meal that takes places following a fast. After Yom Kippur, it is viewed as a festive meal. The tendency is to overeat after a fast, but this should be avoided. Since the digestive system slows down during fasting, heavy foods such as meat are liable to cause indigestion. Therefore, many Jews are religiously accustomed to eating dairy foods after a fast. Eating light, dairy foods in moderation is considered healthier.\n\nDuring the four Minor Fasts a number of changes are made to the liturgy. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928635", "title": "Sword making", "text": "Sword making\n\nSword making, historically, has been the work of specialized smiths or metalworkers called bladesmiths or swordsmiths. Swords have been made of different materials over the centuries, with a variety of tools and techniques. While there are many criteria for evaluating a sword, generally the four key criteria are hardness, strength, flexibility and balance. Early swords were made of copper, which bends easily. Bronze swords were stronger; by varying the amount of tin in the alloy, a smith could make various parts of the sword harder or tougher to suit the demands of combat service. The Roman gladius was an early example of swords forged from blooms of steel.\n\nA good sword has to be hard enough to hold an edge along a length which can range from to more than . At the same time, it must be strong enough and flexible enough that it can absorb massive shocks at just about any point along its length and not crack or break. Finally, it should be balanced along its length so that it can be wielded effectively.\n\nBronze items are typically cast, not forged. Secondary operations involve removing material from the roughcasting, polishing, and the application of decorative elements. Some Chinese swords used high-tin bronze for the edges, since it is harder, and keeps a sharp edge longer, but is more brittle than the softer, lower-tin alloy used for the blade's core. Bronze alloys with lower tin content are tougher, or more resistant to fracturing.\n\nJapanese smiths discovered, similarly to many others, that iron sand (with little to no sulfur and phosphorus) heated together with coal (carbon) made the steel they called \"tamahagane\". This allows the sword to have the strength and the ability to hold a sharp edge, as well as to cause the sword to tend to bend rather than flex under stress. The process starts in the combining of the iron and carbon, by heating iron sand to 1200-1500 degrees Celsius in a traditional furnace, or \"tatara\", for 72 hours. The \"tamahagane\" is then cooled and the smelter selects the best pieces to send to the swordsmith.\n\nThe swordsmith takes the \"tamahagane\" nuggets and forges them into a block. In the process of forming, the block is heated to around 900 degrees Celsius. Taken out of the fire and hammered into a thinner block, the block is scored in the center with an axe and folded over, making it thick again. The block is then placed back in the fire. The steel can be folded transversely or longitudinally. Often both folding directions are used to produce the desired grain pattern. This process, called the \"shita-kitae\", is repeated from 8 to as many as 16 times. After 20 foldings, there is too much diffusion in the carbon content; the steel becomes almost homogeneous in this respect, and the act of folding no longer gives any benefit to the steel.\n\nDepending on the amount of carbon introduced, this process forms either the very hard steel for the edge called \"hagane\", or the slightly less hardenable spring steel called \"kawagane\", which is often used for the sides and the back. Once the sword took the shape the swordsmith wanted, the swordsmith would clay the spine of the sword, called \"tsuchioki\", and heat it once more. Once the sword was red hot the swordsmith took the newly formed sword and quenched it in water, hardening the blade. Then he would pass it on to a polisher and finisher.\n\nOnce the blade had been heat-treated, a sword would be ground with progressively finer abrasives, typically different types of rock. Some grinding rocks can range in the thousands of dollars today. They would polish and sharpen the sword until the desired finish was achieved. This process is long and tedious, but a good polisher was of great value to the swordsmith and was often paid well. After the sword was polished, the fine tip could be sharpened. The sharpness of a sword, and ability to keep that edge, is based on the angle of the edge and the width of the body of the sword. How long it can hold the edge is also dependent on the material used.\n\nSwords can be shaped by a variety of metalworking techniques. In some times and places, one technique has been used exclusively, in others a combination of techniques have been used. The primary techniques are forging and stock removal.\n\nForging uses heat to bring the material to a malleable state. The material is then hammered to shape, typically using hammer and anvil together with specialized set and fuller tools depending on the particular technique. There is a variety of forging techniques for sword making and many variations upon those.\n\nStock removal shapes the sword from prepared stock that is larger in all dimensions than the finished sword by filing, grinding and cutting. While the technique has been available for centuries it was not widely used for making swords until the 19th or 20th century as it is wasteful of the raw material. Where iron and steel are plentiful this method is frequently used as it requires less time. In places and times where iron and steel have been more rare and valuable stock removal has not been used except as part of the finishing process.\n\nIn most techniques, the basic materials, generally iron and/or steel, are shaped into a bar or billet first. At this stage, if several metals are to be used they will be combined by welding to form the billet. In some techniques, notably the traditional folded steel blades of China, Korea, and Japan, the billet might be drawn, folded and welded back on itself creating layers of steel of different types. In others longer bars or rods of steel and iron might be welded together, edge to edge, to create the basic billet placing the softer iron inside with the steel at the core and edges. Once the billet is created it is drawn out farther, generally tapering to the edge(s) and point. The technique of fullering might be used to create a ridge or ridges down the length of the blade. Whether single or multiple, the ridge's primary purpose to give the blade greater structural strength relative to its mass.\n\nDuring fabrication, the metal might be annealed to relieve stresses built up from forging and differential heating, and to make the metal easier to file, engrave or polish.\n\nAfter the workpiece is done being formed, it is normalized. The blade is then carefully and evenly heated and afterwards cooled slowly. The point of normalizing is to remove the stresses which may have built up within the body of the blade while it was being forged. During the forging process, the blade might be heated and cooled differentially creating stress, some parts might be hammered more than others, some areas hammered enough to harden them. If these stresses are left in the blade they could affect the finishing and when it came time to heat treat the blade, the hardening and tempering might not be as even. Potentially enough stress could be added that the blade would be weak in spots, weak enough that it could fail under enough stress.\n\nAs one of the last processes in fabricating a sword is quenching and tempering it. Quenching hardens the metal so it holds an edge longer but this also makes it very brittle. To restore some ductility and durability the sword is tempered. With swords, due to their length, the challenge is greater as in a typical quenching it is possible to bend or warp the blade if it is not introduced to the quenchant smoothly and evenly.\n\nSwords could also be differentially hardened so that some parts, like the cutting edge, are harder than the body.\n\nFinishing encompasses polishing, decorating, and crafting and assembling the hilt, guard and sheath.\n\nThe swordsmith would be most concerned with the state of the blade itself and possibly decorating the blade and preparing the guards and pommel. Other artisans would likely be involved in the work of fashioning the hilt, sheath and other furniture; and in any fine decoration.\n\nSwords are still being made by modern artisans. Some pursue the traditional methods while others apply modern tools, techniques and materials to the craft. The vast majority of commercially available swords have been made with modern tools and materials as it brings greater profit and less time than hand forging. Most commercially available swords have been manufactured by stock removal.\n\n\n"}

It is understood as a sort of body made up of thoughts, just as the emotional body consists of emotions and the physical body is made up of matter. In occult understanding, thoughts are not just subjective qualia, but have an existence apart from the associated physical organ, the brain.\n\nAccording to Theosophists C.W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant (Adyar School of Theosophy), and later Alice Bailey, the mental body is equivalent to the \"Lower Manas\" of Blavatsky's original seven principles of man. But the New Age writer Barbara Brennan describes the Mental body as intermediate between the Emotional and the Astral body in terms of the layers in the \"Human Energy Field\" or Aura.\n\nThe mental body is usually considered in terms of an aura that includes thoughtforms. In Theosophical and Alice Bailey's teachings, it corresponds to the Mental plane.\n\nAccording to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings, the mind is the latest acquisition of the human spirit and is related to the \"Region of Concrete Thought\", which is the lower region of the World of Thought. It is not yet an organized body and in most people it is still a mere inchoate cloud disposed particularly in the region of the head. It works as the link or focus between the \"threefold\" Spirit and the \"threefold\" body , in a reversed reflexion manner : the mind is like the projecting lens of a stereopticon, it projects the image in one of three directions, according to the will of the thinker, which ensouls the thought-form.\n\nHis writings, called Western Wisdom Teachings, give a clear description on how the man's inner Spirit perceives, from the world of thought, the lower worlds through the mind: \" We ourselves, as Egos, function directly in the subtle substance of the Region of Abstract Thought, which we have specialized within the periphery of our individual aura. Thence we view the impressions made by the outer world upon the vital body through the senses, together with the feelings and emotions generated by them in the desire body, and mirrored in the mind. From these mental images we form our conclusions, in the substance of the Region of Abstract Thought, concerning the subjects with which they deal. Those conclusions are ideas. By the power of will we project an idea through the mind, where it takes concrete shape as a thought-form by drawing mind-stuff around itself from the Region of Concrete Thought. \".\n\nHe also states that to the trained clairvoyant there appears to be an empty space in the center of the forehead just above and between the eyebrows and it looks like the blue part of a gas flame, but not even the most gifted seer can penetrate that veil, also known as \"THE VEIL OF ISIS\".\n\nSamael Aun Weor stated that only those who have worked consciously to do so have created a mental body. A \"solar mind\" or \"solar mental body\" is the quality of mind of a true human, yet, it is stated that this humanity is not composed of true humans, but rather intellectual animals: beings with a mind of an animal, but reasoning superior to that of other animals. According to Samael Aun Weor, the qualifications to being a real human being is identical to the lowest requirements of being a Buddha. The process of acquiring the mind of a human in this sense involves the psychological death of the \"I\" (desire) and the work of practical sexual alchemy. More explicitly stated, the title of Buddha is achieved through the Fourth Initiation of Major Mysteries, when the fourth serpent of fire or kundalini has risen.\n\nWhether the lunar or solar aspect, the mental body is stated to exist within the 5th dimension and is represented by Netzach. With the mental body one can travel through the mental world, the world of thoughts and ideas.\n\nIn Esoteric Christianity, the mental body is represented by the stubborn yet useful donkey that the Savior (Christ) subdues in order to be used as a vehicle to enter into heavenly Jerusalem (the superior worlds).\n\n"}

In autumn 1599, Michael was elected prince of Transylvania by the Estates of the country. Although the Emperor Rudolf II wanted Michael and his general Basta to govern Transylvania together, Michael, the \"de facto\" ruler, despised Basta from their initial meetings. Therefore, at a certain point in 1600, Michael became disgraced at the Habsburg emperor.\n\nIn 1600, Hungarian noblemen from Transylvania rebelled against Michael and gathered an army near GyulafehÃ©rvÃ¡r (Alba Iulia). The troops of Basta joined the Hungarian noblemen rebelling against Michael. The ethnic Hungarian Szeklers, however, kept supporting Michael as he had confirmed Szekler privileges disputed by the Hungarian nobility. \n\nBasta marched against the Wallachian army which Michael had gathered in the small village of MiriszlÃ³ (), a few kilometers north of the river MureÅ. The Wallachian army numbered approximately 22,000, consisting mainly of mercenaries of different nationalities, including Hungarian Szeklers, Cossacks, and Poles. Baba Novac led the cavalry at the center of the army. Basta's army of 30,000 consisted of troops of the Hungarian nobility, Austrian and Saxon troops, mostly mercenaries. \n\nMichael's forces began the battle with a well-positioned cannonade from a hillside, while his main troops were protected in the town by 2,000 Szekler gunmen. In this first stage, many Hungarian noblemen were killed by cannonballs, and the battle appeared to be setting itself as an easy victory for Michael.\n\nHowever, Basta had set a trap for the Wallachian army; by pretending to retreat from his position, Basta intended for Michael to leave his defensive entrenchments and follow the Austrian. Upon viewing Basta's feigned retreat, Michael supposedly said, \"Now the coward dog is running, we should follow him.\" Michael's army quickly left the fortifications to charge Basta's army, but the general turned his heavy cavalry on the advancing Wallachians and routed them.\n\nThis defeat caused panic to ensue in Michael's army. The Cossack mercenaries were the first to flee, leading to many of them drowning in the Maros. Baba Novac led a determined resistance in the middle of the line with his cavalry, but it was not enough to turn the tide of the battle. Realizing the futility of continuing the battle, Michael took his horse and swam across the Maros. The Wallachian casualties were high, with more than 5,000 men killed in action and many more prisoners, especially Szeklers, later executed by the vindictive Hungarian nobility. Basta's army lost approximately 1,000 men in the battle. \nThe defeat of Michael put an end to his rule in Transylvania. After being soon expelled from Wallachia by the Polish troops led by Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, Michael went to Prague to win Rudolf's favour once again. After succeeding to do so, he was sent back to Transylvania by Rudolf in 1601. Basta and Michael defeated together prince Sigismund BÃ¡thory at GoroszlÃ³, however, Basta had him assassinated on August 9, 1601.\n\nAs he was already the prince of Wallachia and Moldavia, his election prince of Transylvania is regarded by Romanian historiography as a very important moment of Romanian history, being the first occasion that all three territories which had a Romanian population came under a single ruler. Romanian historiography asserts that it was Michael's goal to unite the three provinces inhabited by Romanians.\n\nHungarian historiography regards his election prince of Transylvania as an episode in the anarchic years of the Long War fought by the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire which did not have national character in the modern sense of the term. In Transylvania, these years were characterized by fierce political struggle and intrigues between different factions of Hungarian nobility, ethnic Hungarian Szeklers and Saxons forming the Union of Three Nations. This struggle was combined with the military and political interference into Transylvanian affairs by the rivaling Habsburg and Ottoman Empires supporting from time to time one faction or another. The years of the Long War had a devastating effect on Transylvania which took an end only by the rule of prince IstvÃ¡n Bocskay in 1604.\n"}

Like other legal sociologists, he insisted that law is not merely the rules or decisions produced, interpreted and enforced by agencies of the state, such as legislatures, courts and police. Groups and communities of various kinds, whether formally structured or informally organised, produce regulation for themselves and others, which can properly be considered law from a sociological standpoint. Gurvitch's legal pluralism is, however, far more rigorous and radical than that of most legal sociologists and locates an immense variety of types of law in the various kinds of socialityâor social interactionâthat he distinguished in his writings. He saw the need to stress the reality and significance of social law and social rights, in opposition to what he termed individual law.

It is said to be in immediate contact with the physical body, to sustain it and connect it with \"higher\" bodies.\n\nThe English term \"etheric\" in this context seems to derive from the Theosophical writings of Madame Blavatsky, but its use was formalised by C.W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant due to the elimination of Hindu terminology from the system of seven planes and bodies. (Adyar School of Theosophy).\n\nThe term gained some general popularity after the 1914-18 war, Walter John Kilner having adopted it for a layer of the \"human atmosphere\" which, as he claimed in a popular book, could be rendered visible to the naked eye by means of certain exercises.\n\nThe classical element Aether of Platonic and Aristotlean physics continued in Victorian scientific proposals of a Luminiferous ether as well as the cognate chemical substance ether. According to Theosophists and Alice Bailey the etheric body inhabits an etheric plane which corresponds to the four higher subplanes of the physical plane. The intended reference is therefore to some extremely rarefied matter, analogous in usage to the word \"spirit\" (originally \"breath\"). In selecting it as the term for a clearly defined concept in an Indian-derived metaphysical system, the Theosophists aligned it with ideas such as the prana-maya-kosha (sheath made of prana, subtle breath or life-force) of Vedantic thought.\n\nIn popular use it is often confounded with the related concept of the astral body as for example in the term astral projection - the early Theosophists had called it the \"astral double\". Others prefer to speak of the \"lower and higher astral\".\n\nLinga sarira is a Sanskrit term for the invisible double of the human body, the etheric body or etheric double (or astral body in some Theosophical concepts). It is one of the seven principles of the human being, according to Theosophical philosophy.\n\nRudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy, often referred to the etheric body (\"Ãtherleib\" or \"Life Body\") in association with the etheric formative forces and the evolution of man and the cosmos. According to him, it can be perceived by a person gifted with clairvoyance as being of \"peach-blossom color\".\n\nSteiner considered the etheric reality or life principle as quite distinct from the physical material reality, being intermediate between the physical world and the astral or soul world.\nThe etheric body can be characterised as the life force also present in the plant kingdom. It maintains the physical body's form until death. At that time, it separates from the physical body and the physical reverts to natural disintegration.\n\nAccording to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings, the etheric body, composed of four ethers, is called the \"Vital Body\" since the ether is the way of ingress for vital force from the Sun and the field of agencies in nature which promote such vital activities as assimilation, growth, and propagation. It is an exact counterpart of our physical body, molecule for molecule, and organ for organ, but it is of the opposite polarity. It is slightly larger, extending about one and one-half inches beyond the periphery of the physical body.\n\nSamael Aun Weor teaches that the vital body is the tetra-dimensional part of the physical body and the foundation of organic life. He states that in the second Initiation of Fire, which is reached through working with sexual magic with a spouse, the Kundalini rises in the vital body. Then the initiate learns how to separate the two superior ethers from the others in order for them to serve as a vehicle to travel out of the physical body.\n\nOn the Tree of Life of the Kabbalah, the vital body is often related to the sephirah Yesod.\n\nIn the teachings of Theosophy, Devas are regarded as living either in the atmospheres of the planets of the solar system (\"Planetary Angels\") or inside the Sun (\"Solar Angels\") (presumably other planetary systems and stars have their own angels) and they help to guide the operation of the processes of nature such as the process of evolution and the growth of plants; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human being. It is believed by Theosophists that devas can be observed when the third eye is activated. Some (but not most) devas originally incarnated as human beings.\n\nIt is believed by Theosophists that nature spirits, elementals (gnomes, ondines, sylphs, and salamanders), and fairies can also be observed when the third eye is activated. It is maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings have never been previously incarnated as human beings; they are regarded as on a separate line of spiritual evolution called the âdeva evolutionâ; eventually, as their souls advance as they reincarnate, it is believed they will incarnate as devas.\n\nIt is asserted by Theosophists that all of the above-mentioned beings possess etheric bodies (but no physical bodies) that are composed of \"etheric matter\", a type of matter finer and more pure that is composed of smaller particles than ordinary physical plane matter.

The Monsanto process has largely been supplanted by the Cativa process, a similar iridium-based process developed by BP Chemicals Ltd which is more economical and environmentally friendly.\n\nThis process operates at a pressure of 30â60 atm and a temperature of 150â200Â Â°C and gives a selectivity greater than 99%. It was developed in 1960 by the German chemical company, BASF, and improved by the Monsanto Company in 1966, which introduced a new catalyst system.\n\nThe catalytically active species is the anion \"cis\"-[Rh(CO)I] (top of scheme). The first organometallic step is the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to \"cis\"-[Rh(CO)I] to form the hexacoordinate species [(CH)Rh(CO)I]. This anion rapidly transforms, via the migration of a methyl group to an adjacent carbonyl ligand, affording the pentacoordinate acetyl complex [(CHCO)Rh(CO)I]. This five-coordinate complex then reacts with carbon monoxide to form the six-coordinate dicarbonyl complex, which undergoes reductive elimination to release acetyl iodide (CHC(O)I). The catalytic cycle involves two non-organometallic steps: conversion of methanol to methyl iodide and the hydrolysis of the acetyl iodide to acetic acid and hydrogen iodide.\n\nThe reaction has been shown to be first-order with respect to methyl iodide and [Rh(CO)I]. Hence the oxidative addition of methyl iodide is proposed as the rate-determining step.\n\nAcetic anhydride is produced by carbonylation of methyl acetate in a process that is similar to the Monsanto acetic acid synthesis. Methyl acetate is used in place of methanol as a source of methyl iodide.\n\nIn this process lithium iodide converts methyl acetate to lithium acetate and methyl iodide, which in turn affords, through carbonylation, acetyl iodide. Acetyl iodide reacts with acetate salts or acetic acid to give the anhydride. Rhodium iodides and lithium salts are employed as catalysts. Because acetic anhydride hydrolyzes, the conversion is conducted under anhydrous conditions in contrast to the Monsanto acetic acid synthesis.\n\n"}

It represents the fourth [higher] subplane of the physical plane (a hyperplane), the lower three being the states of solid, liquid, and gaseous matter. The idea was later used by authors such as Alice Bailey, Rudolf Steiner, Walter John Kilner and others.\n\nThe term aether (also written as \"ether\") was adopted from ancient Greek philosophy and science into Victorian physics (see Luminiferous aether) and utilised by Madame Blavatsky to correspond to akasha, the fifth element (quintessence) of Hindu metaphysics. \n\nThe Greek word \"aither\" derives from an Indo-European root \"aith\"- (\"burn, shine\"). Blavatsky also related the idea to the Hindu \"Prana\" principle, the vital, life-sustaining force of living beings, present in all natural processes of the universe. Prana was first expounded in the Upanishads, where it is part of the worldly, physical realm, sustaining the body and the mind. Blavatsky also tended to use the word \"astral\" indiscriminately for these supposed subtle physical phenomena. The esoteric concepts of Adi, the Buddhic plane, the causal plane, and the monadic plane are also related to that of the etheric plane.\n\nLeadbeater and Besant (both belonging to the Adyar School of Theosophy) conceived that the etheric plane constituted four higher subplanes of the physical plane. According to the Theosophist Geoffrey A. Farthing, Leadbeater used the term, because of its resonance in the physical sciences, to describe his clairvoyant investigations of sub-atomic physics. \n\nSimilarly according to the Rosicrucian writings of American occultist and mystic Max Heindel there is - in addition to the solids, liquids, and gases which compose the \"Chemical Region\" of the Physical World - a finer grade of matter called ether that permeates the atomic structure of the earth and its atmosphere. It is disposed in four grades of density and is considered to be a kind of physical matter (the blue haze seen in mountain canyons is said to be in fact ether of the kind known to occult investigators as \"chemical ether\"). Associated there is also a type of spiritual sight, that man will eventually develop, called \"etheric vision\". Ether is reported to be of four kinds, or grades of density in our planet Earth; their names (from the lowest or most dense to the highest or most subtle one) and their relation to the human being, from the point of view of these Esoteric Christian teachings, is as following:\n\n\n\n"}

Almost 300 suspects were detained in the first day of the operation.\n\nIt followed Operation Matador, and preceded Operation New Market.\nThe United States led a coalition force into Iraq to overthrow the Saddam Hussein government. This was the beginning of the Iraq War. The war was meant to stop terrorism from spreading out of Iraq after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The United States was joined by the United Kingdom and many other coalition forces in the invasion of Iraq. The beginning of the invasion led to many different operations throughout the Iraq War, the most famous being Operation Red Dawn which led to the capture of Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein being captured led to various groups and governments trying to take power of Iraq leading to sectarian violence. Throughout the many stages of the Iraq war Operation Squeeze Play was a minor operation but portrayed a new hope to the coalition force. This coalition force was seen as the beginning of a new era to military officials because of the cooperation of the parties that ultimately led to success.\nThe goal of this operation was to raid Eastern Baghdadi cities and detain anybody linked to terrorism in hopes of fighting terror in the capital of Iraq. The raids began in the waning days of May in 2005 and led to about 400 detainees in a span of 48 hours. The coalition task force was going house to house in the Eastern Baghdadi cities clearing blocks in hopes of finding suspected terrorists or anybody with useful information on known terrorists in the city. The residents of the war ravaged city accepted the military forces well and even provided information about known terrorists that were spotted in the city. These specific cities were of interest to the coalition military because of the constant use of homemade roadside explosives that were common in this area of Iraq and the geographic location of the city. The cities was used as a harboring spot for both Ba\"ath Party terrorists and the Zarqawi terrorist network between Baghdad and Fallujah. Along with over 400 suspected links to terror detained there were also 6 American lives lost during the operation.\n\nThe United States led the coalition force into Iraq. Specifically in Operation Squeeze Play, the units that were involved in this operation were two battalions from the 3rd Brigade, 6th Iraqi Army Division along with two battalions from the 1st Brigade, 1st Iraqi Intervention Force. Not only did the United States provide these units they also provided three battalions from the 2nd Brigade Special Police Commandos and Soldiers from Task Force 2-14, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division. The United States alone provided more than 900 troops to this operation; these consisted of soldiers, marines, pilots, and sailors. These 900 Americans were tasked with regaining ground in Iraq to prevent the spread of terrorism. American officials believed that if they withdrew troops from Eastern Baghdad after the operation that the city would fall to terrorism immediately. After the clearance of the city, Americans began training the Iraqi military and police force in hopes that they will be strong enough to fight off insurgents if they tried retaking that portion of Baghdad. With these efforts, military officials began telling residents of the city the true hopes of the insurgents; the insurgents only want the city to continue their terroristic attacks.\n\nIraqi forces and the American military worked together during this operation to see the detaining of 400 suspects in what was a productive 48 hours for the coalition forces. Â Together both forces brought useful information to the table and working together ultimately led them closer to their goal, which was clearing out terror suspects around the Baghdad suburbs. The American military brought over 900 troops and useful technology as well as their massive arsenal. The Iraqi forces were useful in the long term planning of this operation. With the Iraqi military and police force joining the Americans they were able to learn from the Americans techniques on how to establish a stronghold in hopes they would be able to keep terror suspects out of their cities after the United States withdraws their forces. They also provided information on the region but most importantly they provided information on how to detect roadside explosives Â which were extremely common in Baghdadi cities and offered one of the biggest threats to Americans.\n"}
{"id": "1928724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928724", "title": "Mental plane", "text": "Mental plane\n\nThe mental plane, or world of thought, in Hermeticism, Theosophical, Rosicrucian, Aurobindonian, and New Age thought refers to the macrocosmic or universal plane or reality that is made up purely of thought or mindstuff. In contrast to Western secular modernist and post-modern thought, in occult and esoteric cosmology, thoughts and consciousness are not just a byproduct of brain functioning, but have their own objective and universal reality quite independent of the physical. This reality itself constitutes only one gradation in a whole series of planes of existence (the total number of planes varies, although seven is a common number in Theosophical formulations). In most such cosmologies and explanations of reality, the mental plane is located between, and hence is intermediate between, the astral plane below and the higher spiritual realms of existence above.\n\nIn India in the seventh century b.c.e., the Taittiriya Upanishad referred to five levels of self, of which the middle one is the \"self made of mind\" (\"manas\"). Although the text is describing the nature of the individual rather than the cosmos as a whole, it established the concept of mind as only one of a series of ontological layers of being. The Taittiriyan concept of the five selves would represent an important element of Vedantic ontology, for example the five koshas of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nMeanwhile in Greece, and coming from a philosophical-mystical rather than a yogic perspective, Plato spoke of archetypal forms or ideas as the original spiritual prototypes behind the physical world. These ideas were not equivalent to mind or thought as such. But they did eventually help inspire Middle Platonic (including Philo's) and Neoplatonic metaphysics in which the ideas exist in the mind of God or the Demiurge, or (according to Plotinus and hence Neoplatonism) the Divine Mind or \"Nous\". In the metaphysics of Proclus, the Nous is only one level of hypostasis, with higher ones like Life, Being, and Unity above it.\n\nThe esoteric conception of the mental plane had to wait till the occult revival of the late 19th century, with the development of modern Theosophical, Hermetic, and Kabbalistic ideas that were to serve as the foundation for the current New Age movement.\n\nH. P. Blavatsky taught a cosmology and ontology consisting of seven principles and seven planes. In her writings she aimed at showing how different spiritual systems share a common source, and therefore refers to Vedantic, Buddhist, Samkhyan, Tantric, Neoplatonic, Ancient Egyptian, Kabbalistic, and Occult systems. She relates the mind with the principle of \"Manas\", and also talks about a kosmic Manasic plane. However, the latter represents a very sublime level of consciousness which can be experienced only by enlightened beings.\n\nIn \"The Kabbalah Unveiled\", MacGregor Mathers divides the sephirot (apart from the lowest, \"Malkhut\", representing the physical world) of the Tree of Life into three triads: the Intellectual, Moral, and Astral triads. The Intellectual triad could be compared to the Neoplatonic ideas (Intellect = \"Nous\") and this here represents the highest subdivision.\n\nAround the turn of the twentieth century, Max and Alma ThÃ©on were producing \"The Tradition\". This involved a Lurianic Kabbalistic-inspired cosmology in which the ineffable Godhead emanates a number of sublime worlds, the lowest of which is made up of seven or eight \"States\". The third or fourth lowest State is the Mental or Intellectual, which again corresponds to a very high, spiritual level of consciousness.\n\nAccording to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings, immediately beyond the higher regions of the desire world â which exhibit the marked peculiarity of blending form and sound â and before entering the world of thought (mental plane), there is the \"Great Silence\", where all the world seems to disappear and the spirit has the feeling of floating in an ocean of intense light: all is one eternal now. The world of thought is, according to this author, divided into two regions: the \"Region of Concrete Thought\" (inferior) related to the mind and the \"Region of Abstract Thought\" (superior) related to the third (lower) aspect of the threefold Ego, the \"Human Spirit\" aspect.\n\nHis writings, called \"Western Wisdom Teachings\", describe that the Memory of Nature may be read, in an entirely different manner covering the essence of a whole life, in the highest subdivision of the \"Region of Concrete Thought\" of the \"World of Thought\".\n\nA discipline prevalent in the West is mathematics. The field was strengthened by Pythagoreanism and Philosophy (Platonism, Neoplatonism), which were, alongside ancient Egyptian philosophy, among the oldest non-mythical wisdom paradigms. Math once meant \"magic\" and is still important within occultism, especially topics farther beyond the earthly. Any mathematician who considers the mental plane's dimensionality equal to or more than the earthly one defines them as \"hyperplanes.\" Classical Theosophists (other precursors of Heindel) may not have defined those dimensions, but several neo-Theosophists call the mind 5-dimensional, (i.e. in Einstein-Minkowski spacetime) Platonic terms such as nous or Nous (human or divine mind), synonymous (in contexts) with logistikon/logos or Protologos/Logos-Alogos, and Aristotelean (empiricist, including much/all constructivism) acceptance/use of the terms differ. They may reject that Logos Alogos causes Protologos or Logoi cause/are Nous, or that such or infinite dimensions enumerated in abstract philosophical logic have any use in semi-abstract/-concrete mathematical logic. However, contemporary philosophers are considering dimensions of M-theory physics.\n\nThe influence of C.W. Leadbeater's work on the New Age movement has been underrated. One of Leadbeater's achievements was to make Blavatsky's difficult cosmology simpler and more understandable; for example by equating each of the seven principles or vehicles of consciousness with a corresponding cosmic plane. So there is a physical body that is the vehicle of consciousness on the dense matter of the physical plane; an etheric body, which is formed by the etheric matter found on subtler counterpart of the physical plane; an astral body that corresponds to the astral plane; a mental body which belongs to the lower mental plane, and a causal body, or vehicle of the individual soul, which is located at the level of the higher mental or Causal plane.\n\nThus, for Leadbeater and subsequent theosophists, ex-theosophists (e.g. Alice Bailey) and occultists, the mental plane is a distinct reality or zone of being, more subtle and refined than the Astral, but denser and coarser than the Causal. A detailed account of The Mental Plane and the Mental Body and their associated phenomena, as described by Leadbeater and his co-worker Annie Besant (who succeeded Blavatsky as head of the Theosophical Society), can be found in Arthur E. Powell's \"The Mental Body\".\n\nSri Aurobindo developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and Theon's ideas (which he received via The Mother, who was ThÃ©on's student in occultism for two years). In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the Physical, Vital, and Mental), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (\"Life Divine\" bk. 1 ch. 27). The Aurobindonian Mind or mental plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the overmental divine region (\"Letters on Yoga\", Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of pure mind or pure thought.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928727", "title": "Ambitransitive verb", "text": "Ambitransitive verb\n\nAn ambitransitive verb is a verb that is both intransitive and transitive. This verb may or may not require a direct object. English has many ambitransitive verbs. Examples include \"read\", \"break\", and \"understand\" (e.g., \"I read the book\", saying what was read, or just \"I read all afternoon\").\n\nAmbitransitive verbs are common in some languages, and much less so in other languages, where valency tends to be fixed, and there are explicit valency-changing operations (such as passive voice, antipassive voice, applicatives, causatives, etc.).\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two types of ambitransitive verbs, distinguished by the alignment of the semantic roles of their arguments with their syntactic roles.\n\nAgentive (S = A) ambitransitives are those where the single argument of the intransitive (S) is agentive and it corresponds to the agent (A) of the transitive. In \"Mary\" (S) \"is knitting\", and \"Mary\" (A) \"is knitting a scarf\" (O), the person doing the knitting in both sentences is Mary. Likely candidates for this type of ambitransitive include those where an action can be described in general terms or with respect to a specific patient. English examples include \"eat\", \"follow\", \"help\", \"knit\", \"read\", \"try\", \"watch\", \"win\", \"know\", and many others. These transitive versions have been called unergative verbs, but this term is not fully accepted since it is used for many other senses.\n\nPatientive (S = O) ambitransitives are those where the single argument of the intransitive (S) corresponds to the object (O) of the transitive. For example, in the sentence \"John (S) tripped\" and \"John (A) tripped Mary (O)\", John is doing the falling in the first sentence. Likely candidates for this type of ambitransitive are verbs that affect an agent spontaneously, or those that can be engineered by an agent. English has \"bend\", \"break\", \"burn\", \"burst\", \"change\", \"cool\", \"enter\", \"extend\", \"fall\", \"frighten\", \"grow\", \"hurry\", \"melt\", \"move\", \"open\", \"spill\", \"stretch\", \"trip\", \"turn\", \"twist\", \"walk\", and many other verbs. Such verbs are also called labile verbs (or \"ergative verbs\").\n\nConfusingly, verbs of this type have also been called unaccusative verbs, middle voice, anticausative verbs in the literature, but these terms usually have other meanings in the literature. In a useful discussion of the terminology, Dixon flat out rejects the use of the word ergative to describe such verbs, which was originated by Halladay's 1967 paper and propagated by Lyons' 1968 textbook, because the \"ergativity\" is contained entirely in the lexical unit and has no influence on a language's overall morphological or syntactic ergativity. \n\nFor some of these verbs, native speakers' intuition tells us these words are primarily transitive and secondarily intransitive (such as \"smash\" or \"extend\"). For other words, the opposite is true (\"trip\", \"explode\", \"melt\", \"dissolve\", \"walk\", \"march\"). This latter group can be said to undergo change into a causative verb.\n\nAlternating ambitransitives are not uncommon in English. In the Romance languages, such verbs are rarely found, since the same semantic concept is covered by pseudo-reflexive verbs. These verbs behave like ambitransitives, but the intransitive form requires a clitic pronoun that usually serves also for reflexive constructions. See for example, in Spanish (which uses the pronoun \"se\" in the third person):\n\n\nIn the example, the verbs \"romper\", \"hundir\" and \"derretir\" are all transitive; they become intransitive by using the pseudo-reflexive clitic, and the direct object becomes the intransitive subject.\n\nAmbiguity may arise between these and true reflexive forms, especially when the intransitive subject is animate (and therefore a possible agent). \"Me estoy hundiendo\" usually means \"I'm sinking\" (patientive first person), but it could also mean \"I'm sinking myself\", \"I'm getting myself sunk\" (agentive).\n\n\n"}

Of military background, he was a commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) that fought against Serbian rule in 1998â1999, earlier being a commander in the Croatian War of Independence in Croatian Army.\n\nÃeku is an ethnic Albanian who served as an officer in the Croatian Army during the Croatian War of Independence and was military commander of the KLA during the 1998â1999 Kosovo War, and then commanded the Kosovo Protection Corps under the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.\n\nÃeku was born in ÄuÅ¡ka (\"Qyshk\" in Albanian), a village near PeÄ, at the time part of the Kosovo-Metohija Province of PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter Agim Ãeku finished the secondary military school in Belgrade, he attended the Zadar Military Academy. Shortly afterwards, he joined the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) as an artillery captain. In 1991 the Yugoslav wars broke out and he deserted from the JNA and joined the Croatian National Guard (which transformed into the Croatian Army), when the Republic of Croatia fought a war in breaking away from Yugoslavia. The Croatian Army fought the Serb breakaway Republic of Serbian Krajina. He participated in several military operations, he first was in Operation Maslenica when he was the head of Velebit's artillery section, from January to February 1993, Operation Medak pocket near GospiÄ, in which he was wounded, and Operation Storm in August 1995 that captured most of the Krajina territory. Subsequently, he continued the advance as head of Croatian forces into the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina fighting in western Bosnia against the forces of the Serb Republic in Operation Maestral.\n\nAfter the war the Croatian Army was reformed and President Franjo TuÄman named Ãeku commanding officer of the Fifth District Region in Rijeka. In 1998 he filed a request for retirement in order to go to Kosovo to join the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) that fought Serbian rule, which was officially fulfilled in February 1999 with his resignation.\n\nÃeku had developed contacts with the KLA in the mid-1990s. When war broke out in Kosovo, the KLA initially did very badly against the Yugoslav forces, due in part to poor leadership under senior commander Sylejman Selimi, a militarily inexperienced individual who had been given the post largely because of his influence in the Drenica region (the KLA's heartland).\n\nIn May 1999, Ãeku was appointed the KLA's chief of staff, replacing Selimi. He immediately set about reorganising the KLA and implementing a proper military structure within the organization. In the closing days of the Kosovo War, the KLA began providing systematic intelligence to NATO as well as mounting attacks to lure Serbian forces into the open, enabling NATO warplanes to bomb them. According to reports at the time, Ãeku was the principal liaison between NATO and the KLA.\n\nFollowing the end of the war in June 1999, Ãeku oversaw the demilitarisation of the KLA and its transformation into the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC), an ostensibly civilian organization charged with disaster response, demining, search and response and humanitarian projects. Although the international community insisted the KPC was a civilian organization, Ãeku and its membership said they believed the KPC should evolve into the future army of an independent Kosovo. Ãeku managed ably many difficult challenges for the KPC, including allegations that its members were supporting the ethnic Albanian insurgency in Macedonia in 2001.\n\nOn 10 March 2006, Ãeku was elected Prime Minister of Kosovo by the Kosovo Assembly. After being sworn in, he declared his support for Kosovo independence, whilst promising to protect the rights of the Serbian minority. Ãeku's appointment was backed by former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who resigned in early 2005 after the ICTY had indicted him for war crimes. In his first one hundred days in office, Ãeku prioritized the implementation of the UN-endorsed \"Standards\" for good governance and multi-ethnicity, earning praise from UN Kosovo chief SÃ¸ren Jessen-Petersen and Contact Group countries. On 24 July 2006, Ãeku traveled to Vienna for the first high-level meeting between the Presidents and Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo to discuss Kosovo's future status.\n\nHe stated that he would found a new political party after stepping down as PM, dispelling rumours that he would join the Reformist Party ORA. However, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Kosovo on 10 April 2008, and did not rule out that the party would unify with ORA.\n\nOn 23 February 2011, Ãeku was made Minister of Security Forces of Kosovo.\n\nThe Serbian government has accused Ãeku of war crimes. Although Ãeku has not been the subject of any ICTY indictment, he was briefly detained in Slovenia in October 2003 and in Hungary in March 2004 on the basis of an Interpol warrant issued by Serbia. Ãeku was quickly released in both instances following pressure by the UNMIK. The ICTY issued the last indictments in late 2004 and limited all further investigations to ongoing cases only.\n\nIn May 2009, Colombian authorities expelled Ãeku from a conference held in the country due to Serbia's extradition request based on possible war crimes committed by him during the Kosovo War.\n\nOn 23 June 2009 he was arrested in Bulgaria under the Interpol arrest warrant issued by Serbia for alleged war crimes in Kosovo against non-Albanian population. The Bulgarian authorities decided to release him from custody, but requested that he remain in the country for up to 40 days as officials consider Serbia's extradition request. On 30 June, he returned to Kosovo, after the Bulgarian prosecutors decided not to appeal the court's decision for his release.\n\nHe is married to Dragica, who is half-Serbian, half-Croatian. They have three children and the family divides its time between Pristina and the Croatian town of Zadar.\n\n"}
{"id": "1928747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928747", "title": "Hedgehog's dilemma", "text": "Hedgehog's dilemma\n\nThe hedgehog's dilemma, or sometimes the porcupine dilemma, is a metaphor about the challenges of human intimacy. It describes a situation in which a group of hedgehogs seek to move close to one another to share heat during cold weather. They must remain apart, however, as they cannot avoid hurting one another with their sharp spines. Though they all share the intention of a close reciprocal relationship, this may not occur, for reasons they cannot avoid.\n\nBoth Arthur Schopenhauer and Sigmund Freud have used this situation to describe what they feel is the state of the individual in relation to others in society. The hedgehog's dilemma suggests that despite goodwill, human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm, and what results is cautious behavior and weak relationships. With the hedgehog's dilemma, one is recommended to use moderation in affairs with others both because of self-interest, as well as out of consideration for others. The hedgehog's dilemma is used to explain introversion and self-imposed isolation.\n\nThe concept originates in the following parable from the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's \"Parerga und Paralipomena\", Volume II, Chapter XXXI, Section 396:One cold winter's day, a number of porcupines huddled together quite closely in order through their mutual warmth to prevent themselves from being frozen. But they soon felt the effect of their quills on one another, which made them again move apart. Now when the need for warmth once more brought them together, the drawback of the quills was repeated so that they were tossed between two evils, until they had discovered the proper distance from which they could best tolerate one another. Thus the need for society which springs from the emptiness and monotony of men's lives, drives them together; but their many unpleasant and repulsive qualities and insufferable drawbacks once more drive them apart. The mean distance which they finally discover, and which enables them to endure being together, is politeness and good manners. Whoever does not keep to this, is told in England to 'keep his distance.' By virtue thereof, it is true that the need for mutual warmth will be only imperfectly satisfied, but on the other hand, the prick of the quills will not be felt. Yet whoever has a great deal of internal warmth of his own will prefer to keep away from society in order to avoid giving or receiving trouble or annoyance.\n\nIt entered the realm of psychology after the tale was discovered and adopted by Sigmund Freud. Schopenhauer's tale was quoted by Freud in a footnote to his 1921 work \"Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego\" (). Freud stated, of his trip to the United States in 1909: \"I am going to the USA to catch sight of a wild porcupine and to give some lectures.\"\n\nThe dilemma has received empirical attention within the contemporary psychological sciences. Jon Maner and his colleagues (Nathan DeWall, Roy Baumeister, and Mark Schaller) referred to Schopenhauer's \"porcupine problem\" when interpreting results from experiments examining how people respond to ostracism. The study showed that participants who experienced social exclusion were more likely to seek out new social bonds with others.\n\nThe parable of the hedgehog's dilemma has been the basis of numerous works of media, including the show \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\". The award-winning short film \"Henry\" is a modernist version of the hedgehog's dilemma: in this story, the hedgehog eventually finds social comfort through a turtle, that is, a fellow social creature who is invulnerable to the hedgehog's spines. In the context of the original dilemma, this can be taken to represent the need for variability in human social preferences.\n\n"}

{"id": "1928763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928763", "title": "Marvin Miller", "text": "Marvin Miller\n\nMarvin Julian Miller (April 14, 1917 â November 27, 2012) was an American baseball executive who served as the Executive Director of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) from 1966 to 1982. Under Miller's direction, the players' union was transformed into one of the strongest unions in the United States. In 1992, Red Barber said, \"Marvin Miller, along with Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson, is one of the two or three most important men in baseball history.\" Miller was selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in December 2019, for induction in 2020.\n\nMiller was born in The Bronx on April 14, 1917, and grew up in Flatbush, Brooklyn, rooting for the Brooklyn Dodgers. His father, Alexander, was a salesman for a clothing company on the Lower East Side in Manhattan; and, as a youngster, Marvin walked a picket line in a union organizing drive. His mother, Gertrude Wald Miller, who taught elementary school, was a member of the New York City teachers union, now the United Federation of Teachers.\n\nMiller graduated from New York University in 1938 with a degree in Economics. He resolved labor-management disputes for the National War Labor Board in World War II and later worked for the International Association of Machinists and the United Auto Workers. He joined the staff of the United Steelworkers in 1950, became its principal economic adviser and assistant to its president, and took part in negotiating contracts.\n\nAt the United Steelworkers union, Miller worked his way up to be its leading economist and negotiator. In the spring of 1966, Miller visited MLB spring training camps in an effort to be democratically elected Executive Director of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). He won the election by a vote of 489â136.\n\nMiller negotiated MLBPA's first collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the team owners in 1968. That CBA, covering the 1968 and 1969 seasons, was a short document. It won the players a nearly 43 percent increase in the minimum salary from $7,000 to $10,000, as well as larger expense allowances. More importantly, the deal brought a formal structure to ownerâplayer relations, including written procedures for the arbitration of player grievances before the commissioner.\n\nThe next CBA, a three-year deal signed in 1970, built on this gain. For the first time, owner-player disputes not involving the \"integrity of baseball\" could be arbitrated not before the commissioner, an employee of the owners, but before a three-member arbitration panel with a neutral chairman selected jointly by the players and owners.\n\nThroughout the 1969 season, Curt Flood, a perennial standout player for the powerhouse St. Louis Cardinals, argued with Cardinals owner August Busch and General Manager Bing Devine over a $10,000 raise in his $90,000 salary. Shortly after the 1969 season concluded, Devine sent Flood a terse, two sentence letter notifying him that he had been traded to the then National League East cellar dwelling Philadelphia Phillies. Flood took the trade as an insult and also viewed it as a punishment by Cardinals management for his increased salary demands. Philadelphia's Shibe Park was known to be the most dilapidated in the major leagues compared with Busch Stadium that opened in 1966. Worse still, Phillies fans had earned a reputation for being virulent racists as was evidenced by the epithets and garbage they hurled at black player Dick Allen. (So bad was Allen's treatment at the hands of Phillies fans, he took to wearing a batting helmet while playing in the field.) At a conference held in his honor at New York University in 2012, Miller recalled what Flood had said to him about Philadelphia before filing the lawsuit: âOn his experiences in Philadelphia, he said he had observed that the people at the ballpark, patrons, were as racist as any he had ever met in the south, and he was not going to live there or work there.â Coincidentally, Allen was the player the \"Phils\" sent to St. Louis as its part of the bargain for Flood.\n\nFlood wrote a letter to then Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn stating that he did not view himself as \"property\" and instructed Kuhn to notify all teams in Major League Baseball that he was willing to consider financial offers to play for any team during the 1970 season. Flood had chosen to ignore the age old reserve clause, which prevented him from negotiating with any MLB team until he had sat out a season. Flood did not take his challenge of the reserve clause lightly and did consult with Miller before suing MLB and Bowie Kuhn. \"I told him,\" recalled Miller, \"that given the courts' history of bias towards the owners and their monopoly, he didn't have a chance in hell of winning. More important than that, I (Miller) told him even if he won, he'd never get anything out of itâhe'd never get a job in baseball again.\" Flood asked Miller if it would benefit other players. \"I (Miller) told him yes, and those to come.\"\n\nFlood pressed forward with his suit and, as Miller predicted, became what later generations would figuratively call \"radioactive\". The MLBPA officially issued a statement supporting his legal battle, but none of his fellow players nor any of his friends came to his defense as the case \"Flood v. Kuhn\" made its way to the Supreme Court in March 1972. Flood was represented by prominent labor lawyer Arthur Goldberg, a former Secretary of Labor, Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and General Counsel of the United Steelworkers while Marvin Miller was the union's chief negotiator.\n\nMeanwhile, Miller took his union on a \"lightning\" strike on April Fools' Day 1972. From April 1 through April 13, the ballplayers simply stayed away from the ballparks while Miller negotiated with the owners. Baseball only resumed when the owners and players agreed on a $500,000 increase in pension fund payments. Owners agreed to add salary arbitration to the CBA. The total 86 exhibition and regular season games that were missed over the entire 13-day period were never played because the league refused to pay the players for the time they were on strike. Most teams lost anywhere from six to eight games off their 162-game schedule.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided against Flood by a 5â3â1 vote in June 1972. Flood sat out the 1970 season because no owner wanted to set a precedent by flagrantly disobeying the reserve clause. In 1971 he was signed by and played just 13 lackluster games for the Washington Senators. After that, a disgusted Flood never played Major League Baseball again. Twenty years later, Miller wrote in his memoir that Flood told the players union, \"I think the change in black consciousness in recent years has made me more sensitive to injustice in every area of my life.\" Miller also said that Flood was primarily challenging the reserve clause as a professional ballplayer.\n\nAlthough he lost his personal legal battle, Flood had made it possible for other MLB players to challenge the reserve clause. In 1974, Miller used arbitration to resolve a dispute when Oakland Athletics owner Charlie Finley failed to make an annuity payment as required by Cy Young Award winning pitcher Catfish Hunter's contract. The arbitrator ruled that Finley had not met the terms of the contract so Hunter was free to negotiate a new contract with any teamÂ â making Hunter a free agent. Hunter eventually went on to sign a five-year deal with the New York Yankees for $3.5 million and an additional $1 million signing bonus.\n\nIn 1974, Miller encouraged two other pitchers Andy Messersmith of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Dave McNally of the Baltimore Orioles to play out the succeeding year without signing a contract. After the year had elapsed, both players filed a grievance arbitration. The ensuing Seitz decision declared that both players had fulfilled their contractual obligations and had no further legal ties to their ballclubs. This effectively eradicated the reserve clause and ushered in free agency. As an economist, Miller clearly understood that too many free agents could actually drive down player salaries. Miller agreed to limit free agency to players with more than six years of service, hoping that restricting the supply of labor would drive up salaries as owners bid for an annual, finite pool of free agents. Miller's hopes were frustrated for a time as baseball owners engaged in collusion in which they agreed among themselves not to deal with any player who was a free agent.\n\nMiller led the ballplayer's union in two more actions against the Major League owners, the second during 1980 spring training, and the third during the heart of the 1981 regular season. The 1981 strike, which lasted 50 days, forced the total cancellation of 713 games, and is estimated to have cost both the owners and players $146 million. Under Marvin Miller's 16-year tenure as the Executive Director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, the owners engaged in two lockouts, one in 1973 spring training and the other in 1976 spring training, both the result of negotiations for collective bargaining agreements.\n\nDuring Miller's tenure as the Executive Director of the MLBPA, the average player's annual salary rose from $19,000 in 1966 to $326,000 in 1982. Miller taught MLB players the basics of human capital as a commodity they were selling to club owners. Working with MLBPA general counsel, Richard M. Moss, Miller educated the players to trade-union thinking. Moss was one of Miller's most trusted advisors at the MLBPA. Richard M. Moss later went on to become an MLB agent. The 1968 collective bargaining agreement was the first of its kind in pro sports. In 1970, players gained the right to have grievances heard by an impartial arbitrator. In 1973, they achieved a limited right to have salary demands subjected to arbitration.\nMLB is the only professional sport in the U.S. not to have a salary cap. (Although a competitive balance tax has been implemented since 2002, whereby any teams that exceed a mutually agreed upon amount in total salaries are assessed the tax which is paid to MLB and put in an industry growth fund to keep the sport competitive.)\n\nFormer MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent said upon learning of Miller's death in 2012, \"I think he's the most important baseball figure of the last 50 years. He changed not just the sport but the business of the sport permanently, and he truly emancipated the baseball player â and in the process all professional athletes. Prior to his time, they had few rights. At the moment, they control the games.\" His nemesis throughout the 1970s, MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was not so kind. \"I began to realize we had before us an old-fashioned 19th-century trade unionist who hated management generally and the management of baseball specifically.\", Kuhn said of Miller in his memoir.\n\nMarvin Miller was succeeded in 1985 by Donald Fehr, who had joined the Major League Baseball Players Association as general counsel in 1977. Miller, even after retiring, remained close with his successor as a consultant. Fehr stepped down in 2009 and was replaced by the union's general counsel, Michael Weiner.\n\nIn 2000, Hank Aaron endorsed Miller's selection to the Baseball Hall of Fame, saying \"Marvin Miller should be in the Hall of Fame if the players have to break down the doors to get him in.\" Tom Seaver said, \"Marvin's exclusion from the Hall of Fame is a national disgrace.\" Joe Morgan said, \"They should vote him in and then apologize for making him wait so long.\" Broadcaster Bob Costas observed, \"There is no non-player more deserving of the Hall of Fame.\"\n\nMiller fell short of selection to the Hall of Fame in 2003 and 2007. In 2007, he finished as the top executive with 63% of the vote; election requires 75% of the vote. The 2003 and 2007 votes were conducted among a committee of all living Hall of Famers, who are primarily players. Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig told the Associated Press in 2007, \"The criteria for non-playing personnel is the impact they made on the sport. Therefore Marvin Miller should be in the Hall of Fame on that basis. Maybe there are not a lot of my predecessors who would agree with that, but if you're looking for people who make an impact on the sport, yes, you would have to say that.\"\n\nAfter they failed to agree on any candidate, including Miller, the voting body was reduced to 12 members, 10 of them non-playing. CNN Money writer Chris Isidore described the switch's effect on Miller's candidacy: \"Imagine a runner rounding third and heading for home, only to have a last minute rule change move the location of the plate. That's roughly what happened to Marvin Miller's chances of getting his long overdue recognition in baseball's Hall of Fame.\" Asked to predict his chances before the first results under the revised voting format had been announced, Miller said, \"Let me point out one thing. In the last vote, the number of management people among the voters was a certain percentage. On the new committee management is completely dominant. Aside from miracles, there's no reason to believe the vote will do anything but go down.\" Miller was up for election again in under the revamped voting format, but received only three of the necessary nine votes. Referring to the 12-man voting board, Jim Bouton said,\n\nHow did these people vote, and why are their votes kept secret? And why aren't there more players on that committee? Hank Aaron, Jim Bunning, Bob Gibson, Ferguson Jenkinsâthey're all on the committee for reviewing the managers and umpires. Essentially, the decision for putting a union leader in the Hall of Fame was handed over to a bunch of executives and former executives. Marvin Miller kicked their butts and took power away from the baseball establishmentâdo you really think those people are going to vote him in? It's a joke... I blame the players. It's their Hall of Fame; it's their balls and bats that make the hall what it is. Where are the public outcries from Joe Morgan or Reggie Jackson, who was a player rep? Why don't these guys see that some of their own get on these committees? That's the least they owe Marvin Miller. Do they think they became millionaires because of the owners' generosity?\n\nOn July 11, 2008, \"The Boston Globe\" portrayed Miller as disdainful of the realignment of the Hall's Veterans Committee, and as uninterested in the chances of his own enshrinement:\n\nI find myself unwilling to contemplate one more rigged Veterans Committee whose members are handpicked to reach a particular outcome while offering a pretense of a democratic vote. It is an insult to baseball fans, historians, sportswriters, and especially to those baseball players who sacrificed and brought the game into the 21st century. At the age of 91, I can do without farce.\nIn December 2009, in voting for the 2010 class for the Hall of Fame, Miller received seven votes from the 12 committee members, two short of the nine votes needed for election. On April 14, 2010, Miller's 93rd birthday, a group of former major leaguers launched a website called \"ThanksMarvin.com\". The site includes appreciations from retired players, and advocates for Miller's induction to the Hall of Fame.\n\nFurther changes were made to the Veterans Committee voting process in 2010, effective with the 2011 induction cycle. Miller was named as one of 12 figures from what the Hall calls the \"Expansion Era\" (1973âpresent) to be considered. The composition of the new 16-man voting committee was very different from that in 2007, consisting of eight Hall of Famers (seven inducted as players and one as a manager), four media members, and only four executives. Despite the changes, Miller again missed out on election, this time falling one vote short of induction. Miller died in November 2012; he was posthumously listed on the Expansion Era ballot for the 2014 class, but received fewer than seven of 16 votes and was again not elected.\n\nIn July 2016, the Hall of Fame announced changes to the Era Committee system. The system's time-frames were restructured, with Miller to be evaluated by the Modern Baseball Era Committee, considering candidates whose greatest contributions occurred from 1970 to 1987. Miller again fell short in the Modern Baseball Era Committee balloting for 2018, receiving only seven of 16 votes, with 12 votes necessary for election. He was again on the Modern Baseball Era Committee ballot for 2020, and was successfully elected with 12 of 16 votes in December 2019.\n\nThe Baseball Hall of Fame has a 75% threshold for election.\n\nIn 1997, the MLB Players Association created the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award as one of its annual \"Players Choice Awards\".\n\nOn April 1, 2000, he was honored by the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nMiller was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2003.\n\nOn April 26, 2009, he was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nMiller was married to Theresa Morgenstern for 70 years, and the couple had two children, Peter and Susan. Theresa predeceased Marvin. Peter Miller, his son, represented the baseball players in Japan.\n\nMiller was diagnosed with liver cancer in August 2012. He died on November 27, 2012, at the age of 95, in his home in Manhattan. In a statement, Michael Weiner, the executive director of the MLBPA, said:\n\nIt is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of Marvin Miller. All players â past, present and future â owe a debt of gratitude to Marvin, and his influence transcends baseball. Marvin, without question, is largely responsible for ushering in the modern era of sports, which has resulted in tremendous benefits to players, owners and fans of all sports.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928788", "title": "Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3", "text": "Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3\n\nDance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 3 is a Music video game developed by Konami and the tenth entry of Dance Dance Revolution released in the United States. It was released on November 15, 2005 for the Xbox. About 70 songs are available in total in this version. The game was announced in a press release by Konami on May 17, 2005, and unveiled at the EÂ³ expo in Los Angeles that same day.\n\nSimilar to previous Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) titles, this game is played by listening to the music and hitting the up/down/left/right arrows when they hit the outline at the top of the screen after coming up from the bottom. This may be done with an Xbox controller or a DDR controller (dance mat). If you miss steps, your health goes down, but if you time one correctly, the health bar in the upper left slightly goes up. Each individual arrow gets a rating on how close the timing was.\n\nGame Mode is the main mode of DDR Ultramix 3. It plays similarly to the version in the arcade, where a song is picked at a certain difficulty (beginner, light, standard, heavy) and is played through. If you run out of health before the song is completed, the song ends and you fail it. After the song, you get a rating depending on how well you did. Game Mode may also be played with two pads instead of one. Some songs also support an Oni difficulty mode, which may be as difficult, slightly less difficult, or slightly more difficult as the heavy difficulty. While selecting a song, the order of the songs can be changed by default order, alphabetical order, speed of the songs, artist order, and banner order. When holding down A to select a song, there are ways to modify the song before playing through it, such as changing the speed, direction of the arrow flow, and other modifiers.\n\nThe goal of Attack Mode is to knock your opponents down to the bottom line. Getting a combo of a certain five arrows in a row will create an effect during the song to help you or hinder your opponents. In Bomb Mode, everyone passes around a bomb which will explode after a certain amount of time, and last one standing without the bomb wins. Quad Mode is similar to Game Mode, but the player uses four pads at once. With Sync Mode, everyone must press the arrow at the same time to get through the song. Getting a Good or lower on any step will immediately end the song.\n\nIn Score Battle, whoever gets the highest score wins. Point Battle is made for two players, each person starting with 16 points. A player loses a point if the rating of an opponentâs step is higher than the otherâs. The game ends when the loserâs points get to zero. Freestyle follows the basics of picking a song, but there are always four players, and there are no arrows to follow. Players have to hit arrows according to the music. Tips at the bottom of the screen give players tips on how to be a better freestyle dancer throughout the course of the song.\n\nIn Quest Mode, players take control of a character and move around North America trying to become the best dancer. While playing, there are two types of values. One is Fanbase, which is how well you do on a certain song. If you do well in a certain area (get a high enough Fanbase on a song), then you will be recognized as a great dancer there. The other value is Points. Points are gained with each step taken during a song and can be used to buy new things like managers, dancers for your team, and fees for traveling between cities. Getting new managers or dance members on your team throughout the game will make your Fanbase and Points go up even faster with every song.\n\nWhen Workout Mode is unabled, the gane will keep track of every step made by the controller attached to the port. When the \"Summary Screen\" is called upon, it will display everything that the user has done in every game mode. There is also an option to input the weight, and turn on the \"Calorie Tracker\", which tells the player how many calories a player burns. In Challenge Mode, there will be specific challenges the game will give you to move on to the next level. There are ten levels to be completed, each with its set of unique objectives. Training Mode changes the style of songs and uses helping modifiers in order to learn a certain song. It can be started and stopped at any time, and make way for practicing of only certain parts. Jukebox Mode makes the songs available for listening without having to play them. \n\nEdit Mode allows you to customize the steps for any song, allowing you to play at your own style. These customized steps can also be used in other modes, and uploaded or downloaded via Xbox Live. Xbox Live also allows the player to connect with other people who are currently playing the game, and can be used for downloading song packs.\n\n\"Ultramix 3\" features more than 70 songs of different genres.\n\n\"Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3 \" received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to the video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n"}
{"id": "1928795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928795", "title": "The Road to Dune", "text": "The Road to Dune\n\nThe Road to Dune is a collection of science fiction works and related material by American writers Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. A companion book to the \"Dune\" novels, the book was released in September 2005.\n\nThis companion work to the \"Dune\" novels includes an alternate novel based on Frank Herbert's original notes for \"Dune\", letters between Frank Herbert and his editor, the original article by Frank Herbert that inspired the creation of \"Dune\" â \"They Stopped the Moving Sands\" â as well as unused chapters from \"Dune\" and \"Dune Messiah\", and the short stories in the \"Dune\" universe written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.\n\n\"Spice Planet\" is an alternate \"Dune\" story written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson based upon the original story outline that Frank Herbert made for \"Dune\". It features House Linkam (a version of House Atreides) temporarily taking control of Duneworld from their rivals, House Hoskanner (the forerunner of the Harkonnens), to settle a dispute between them. The Hoskanners had received a monopoly concession on the recently discovered Duneworld, but as melange had grown in popularity in the Empire, other Houses had begun to dislike the Hoskanner's wealth and pushed House Linkam to challenge House Hoskanner. The Emperor, secretly allied with the Hoskanners, orders Linkam to take over Duneworld for two years with the promise that if they produce more melange, then they will receive the concession â else it will go permanently to the Hoskanners. Much like in \"Dune\", the Hoskanners sabotage and thwart to the best of their abilities, although the Linkams enlist the help of the Imperial Planetologist to devise a way to neutralize the sandworms and vastly increase the efficiency of operations.\n\nThe story has some obvious links to the original \"Dune\" novel, such as many of the same characters, but some key themes are underdeveloped in this version:\nWhen we arranged all the chapters and read through the remarkable outline, we found that \"Spice Planet\" was a unique and worthy story in its own right, not just a precursor to \"Dune\". Although the harsh desert is very similar to the one familiar to millions of fans, the tale itself is thematically different, focusing on decadence and drug addiction instead of ecology, finite resources, freedom, and religious fanaticism.\n\nThe work is a view into \"what-might-have-been\" had Frank Herbert bowed to the pressure of his editors and written a novel at a length of most paperbacks during the mid-1960s â roughly 20,000 words.\n\nThis collection of letters details the trials and tribulations that Frank Herbert went through to have \"Dune\" published in \"Analog\" magazine and later by Chilton Books. The letters detail how he was encouraged to cut the length of the novel and to ease up on his descriptions of Paul Atreides's prescient powers.\n\n\"They Stopped the Moving Sands\" is an uncompleted article about how sand dunes were held in place by specially designed grasses. The article was never published, but was the impetus for Frank Herbert writing \"Dune\".\n\nAlso included in \"The Road to Dune\" are deleted chapters and alternate scenes from the first two novels in the \"Dune\" chronicles, \"Dune\" and \"Dune Messiah\". These include alternate and extended scenes between Paul and Reverend Mother Mohiam, between Paul and Dr. Yueh, between Paul and Thufir Hawat, between Paul and his father Duke Leto Atreides, the passage to Arrakis on the Spacing Guild heighliner, the escape from Arrakeen and between Paul and a muad'dib mouse. The \"Dune Messiah\" scenes include a new chapter between Alia Atreides and Duncan Idaho, a new introduction and a discarded ending that features the death of the conspirators Edric, the Reverend Mother Mohiam and possibly Princess Irulan at the hands of a Fremen mob incensed by Paul Atreides' death.\n\nThe \"Dune\" short stories \"A Whisper on Caladan Seas\", \"Hunting Harkonnens\", \"Whipping Mek\", and \"The Faces of a Martyr\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are included in this collection. The story \"Dune: Sea Child\", originally published in \"Elemental\", a 2006 benefit anthology for children who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, is also included in the paperback edition of \"Road to Dune\".\n"}

It is situated in Taunton, Somerset, and is operated by Great Western Railway. It is also served by CrossCountry trains and by the West Somerset Railway on special event days and by mainline steam excursions.\n\nOriginally opened on 1 July 1842 as part of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, Taunton was the terminus of the line until a new temporary terminus was opened on 1 May 1843 further west at Beambridge.\n\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel's original design was for a single-sided station with two platforms, each with their own buildings and train sheds, placed on the south side of the line. A hotel was built between them and the Grand Western Canal. Having both platforms on the town side of the line was meant to help passengers but was found to be problematic as the railway became busier, with each train having to cross the line used by trains in the opposite direction. An engine shed was provided at the west end of the station.\n\nA series of branches opened in the area during the next thirty years. These were the Yeovil branch line (1 October 1853), the West Somerset Railway to Watchet (31 March 1862), the Chard Branch Line (11 September 1866), and the Devon and Somerset Railway (8 June 1871, extended to Barnstaple 1 November 1873). While none of these branches had a junction in Taunton, the trains were generally run through to Taunton to provide connections.\n\nThe station was unable to cope with all these extra trains and passengers, so a major rebuilding was completed on 17 August 1868. The \"up station\" at the east end was demolished and replaced by a more conventional platform on the north side of the line; the \"down station\" was extended onto the site now vacated, and a new single train shed was provided covering the whole station. Goods traffic was moved away from the passenger platforms by the opening on 1 November 1896 of a pair of avoiding lines that skirted around the south side of the station behind the old hotel. A larger engine shed was opened in the same year.\nThe platforms were extended again in 1895. Now covering the whole length of the original single-sided station, they were the longest platforms on the Great Western Railway (which had amalgamated with the Bristol and Exeter company on 1 January 1876). New bay platforms were added to handle the trains from the branch lines.\n\nIn the 1930s the lines through Taunton from Cogload Junction to Norton Fitzwarren were widened from two to four tracks; those east of Taunton were brought into use on 13 December 1931 and those to the west on 14 February 1932. This work forced another rebuilding of the station. The train shed was dismantled and new buildings constructed on the up (north) side along with a new island platform in the middle of the station. This gave a platform face for each of the four through lines, which were brought into use on 7 February 1932. Work included a new subway that replaced the old footbridge, and a new booking office at road level on the north side of the station. The old goods shed was replaced by a two-storey goods warehouse next to the avoiding line, east of the station on 20 February 1932.\n\nThe platforms were numbered:\nAlthough some no longer have tracks, all the platform structures remain.\n\nUntil 1970 the four tracks to the east of Taunton were not used as normal main and relief lines, but with the inner main lines for trains to London and the outer lines for trains to Bristol, to align with the way the tracks diverged at Cogload Junction, some miles to the east of the station. In 1970 under the Western Region of British Rail the central island platform was closed off and all trains stopping at Taunton used the outer platforms, except in an emergency when the central platform was pressed into use. London trains stopping at Taunton (which was most of them) now crossed over to the main lines at the London end of the station. The second pair of lines from Cogload were removed in 1986.\n\nThe goods depot closed for general traffic in 1965, although bulk coal was handled until 1972. The engine shed closed on 1 January 1972, by which time it only served as a fueling point for local diesel shunting locomotives. The various branch lines closed during the 1960s and 1970s, so only one bay platform was retained for local trains starting towards Bristol. The island platform was taken out of regular use for a few years, although it could be opened up in an emergency (albeit with no platform numbers, nor a lift). This situation no longer applies as the platforms were reopened for normal services in 2000 and a new lift installed in 2007 to replace an electric \"stair lift\" which could carry one seated person at a time but no luggage. A west-facing bay platform has also been reinstated for passenger use, although there are no regular trains timetabled to use it.\n\nToday the original \"down station\" building survives, along with the hotel and the extensions added in 1868. An examination of the brickwork on the south-side building reveals where the footbridge was removed in favour of the present subway. On the north side, the ticket office dates from 1983 but the remaining buildings generally date from the 1932 rebuilding and stand on foundations from 1868. The goods warehouse is largely derelict and most of the engine shed has been razed to the ground except for an asbestos-clad repair shop built in 1932 and the ramp that used to serve an elevated coaling stage. The engine sidings are still used by engineers' plant machines; Freightliner locomotives are generally stabled at Fairwater Yard but occasionally use the old engine shed sidings for additional storage space. The avoiding line is truncated but serves as a headshunt for the long engineers trains using Fairwater Yard.\n\nThe footbridge to the west of the station, known in the town as \"Fortysteps\", although Network Rail prefer to label it \"40 Steps\", a favoured location for generations of rail enthusiasts, was demolished at the end of 2013, due to construction of a new road alongside the railway. This was however replaced by a more modern bridge with both steps and slopes making it more accessible.\n\n\nThe station is situated on an embankment and a bridge above road level. The ticket office is at ground level on the north side although the town centre lies to the south of the station, about away. There is a car park on both sides of the station and bus services to the town centre call at a bus stop in front of the ticket office; those from the town call at a stop on the main road that passes beneath the station. The south block is a Grade II listed building.\n\nThe platform above the ticket office is Platform 5, which is the main platform used by trains towards London Paddington and also Bristol and the north. The station buffet is situated on this platform. An east-facing bay platform, Platform 6, is beyond this; it only sees occasional use nowadays, mainly being used for local trains towards Bristol.\n\nIn the centre of the station is an island platform. The face on the north side is Platform 4 which can be used by similar trains to Platform 5. The face on the south side is Platform 3, which is used as an extra platform for services towards Exeter but is mainly used for terminating services from the Bristol direction that can also start back from this platform.\n\nThe southerly platform is Platform 2 and is the main platform for services to Exeter and beyond. Trains can also start from this platform towards London and Bristol if required. At the north end is the bus shelter for rail-link buses to Minehead. It has level access from a second car park.\n\nAt the west end of this platform is another bay platform, Platform 1. This is not signalled for use by passenger trains but is sometimes used for stabling. Behind this are some sidings used by the engineers department for stabling on-track plant and the headshunt for Fairwater Yard. This area also housed the station's engine shed but this closed many years ago, although the last remains were only demolished in 2012.\n\nTerminating trains from Bristol that need to cross to Platform 2 or 3 have to run forward towards Fairwater and then return to the station once the driver has changed ends. To reach Platform 6 they have to make this move and then run right through the station, the driver change ends, and then reverse into Platform 6. First Great Western have proposed that alterations be made to the layout at the east end of the station to allow terminating trains from Bristol to run straight into Platform 6. The shunting of trains across the layout at the west end of the station has long been a Taunton feature; in the days of trains to Minehead, Barnstaple, and local stations to Exeter, terminating trains were drawn back from the up side platforms via various sidings, and then returned to the down side departure platforms, and pilot locomotives were provided to assist in the days of hauled stock.\n\nGreat Western Railway operates a typically hourly service through Taunton between London Paddington and destinations such as , , and . There is also an overnight Night Riviera sleeper service on this route. The same operator provides an hourly service to and via .\n\nCrossCountry operates at least an hourly service during the daytime between Plymouth, Bristol Temple Meads, and the North. Most trains run through to Edinburgh Waverley via , with some extensions through to either or & . There are regular steam-hauled services booked to operate from Bristol Temple Meads to and on certain Sundays in the summer months.\n\nA marshalling yard was opened to the west of the station on 30 July 1946. It was used for many years by the British Railways' Civil Engineer and was home to a Ruston and Hornsby 0-6-0 diesel shunter, PWM652. After the end of this permanent way work the sidings were little used, mainly being a place to store unwanted or damaged wagons.\n\nDuring 2006 they were relaid and in January 2007 were returned to use. Fairwater is now the home for a High Output Track Renewal System. This is engaged on renewal of track on the Great Western Main Line west of Swindon, the Reading to Exeter Main Line and the Bristol to Taunton Line. The equipment based in the yard at that time was a Plasser and Theurer High Output Ballast Cleaner, a Matisa High Output Track Renewal Train, and smaller on-track plant. The Matisa Track Renewal Train was removed from Fairwater Yard in April 2012 after it had completed its need for use in the South West.\nTaunton Concrete Works, situated to the north of the line east of the station, cast items for the railway such as bridge beams, platform components, cable troughs and fence posts. The facility was closed in 1994.\n"}

Jones served as chief judge of the Fifth Circuit from 2006 to 2012.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Jones graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1971. She received her Juris Doctor from University of Texas School of Law in 1974, where she was a member of the \"Texas Law Review\". She was in private practice in Houston, Texas, from 1974 until 1985, working for the firm of Andrews, Kurth, Campbell & Jones, where she became the firm's first female partner. She specialized in bankruptcy law. She also served as General Counsel for the Republican Party of Texas from 1982 to 1983.\n\nJones was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on February 27, 1985, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 98 Stat. 333. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 3, 1985, and received commission on April 4, 1985, at the age of 35. She served as Chief Judge from January 16, 2006 to October 1, 2012, succeeding Judge Carolyn Dineen King.\n\nShe sits on the board of directors of the Boy Scouts of America and the Garland Walker American Inns of Court.\n\nIn 2010, Jones visited Iraq as part of the U.S. State Department's Rule of Law program, where she advised and encouraged Iraqi and Kurdish judges.\n\nJones has been mentioned frequently as being on the list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States. A 1990 report from \"The New York Times\" cited her as George H.W. Bush's second choice for the Supreme Court vacancy filled by Justice David Souter. The \"Chicago Sun-Times\" and several other newspapers reported on July 1, 2005, that she had also been considered for nomination to the Supreme Court during the presidency of George W. Bush.\n\nIn her opinions, she has questioned the legal reasoning which legalized abortion, advocated streamlining death penalty cases, invalidated a federal ban on possession of machine guns and advocated toughening bankruptcy laws. In 2006, Chief Judge Jones found that a death row inmate who had filed a \"pro se\" motion to drop his appeal while his attorney was abroad, could not later reinstate his appeal. In June 2017, Jones dissented when the court found that a university did not violate the Due Process Clause or Title IX when it expelled a student for committing a campus sexual assault, as well as his girlfriend, who had recorded the assault and shared the video on social media. In May 2018, Jones wrote for the court when it found that Texas Senate Bill 4, which prohibits local governments or public employees from criticizing federal immigration enforcement or from praising sanctuary cities, did not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nJones attracted attention for her opinion in the case of \"McCorvey v. Hill\", which was a request by the Norma McCorvey, the 'Jane Roe' of \"Roe v. Wade\" to vacate the finding of that case. Jones joined the Fifth Circuit in rejecting the petition on procedural grounds but took the unusual step of handing down a six-page concurrence to the judgment of the court.\n\nThe concurrence credited the evidence presented by McCorvey and sharply criticized the Supreme Court's rulings in \"Roe\" and in the less famous (decided simultaneously) case of \"Doe v. Bolton\". She quoted Justice Byron White's dissent in the latter, describing the Supreme Court's decision as an \"exercise of raw judicial power\". She concluded: \"That the court's constitutional decision making leaves our nation in a position of willful blindness to evolving knowledge should trouble any dispassionate observer not only about the abortion decisions, but about a number of other areas in which the court unhesitatingly steps into the realm of social policy under the guise of constitutional adjudication\".\n\nA group of civil rights organizations and legal ethicists filed a complaint of misconduct against Jones on June 4, 2013, after she allegedly said that \"racial groups like African-Americans and Hispanics are predisposed to crime,\" and are \"prone to commit acts of violence\" which are more \"heinous\" than members of other ethnic groups. According to the complaint, Jones also stated that a death sentence is a service to defendants because it allows them to make peace with God and she \"referred to her personal religious views as justification for the death penalty\". Jones allegedly made the remarks during a speech to the University of Pennsylvania Federalist Society. However, the speech was not recorded, and the ethics complaint was based solely on affidavits from audience members.\n\nIn part because Jones was recently the Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts (in his administrative capacity) transferred the complaints to the judicial ethics panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nOn August 12, 2014, the judicial ethics panel of the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the complaint, citing lack of evidence to justify disciplining Jones. The complainants appealed to the Judicial Conference of the United States, which affirmed the ruling of the judicial ethics panel in February 2015.\n\n\n"}

The straps sometimes have tri-glide slides, making them able to be adjusted to fit. The American and British names derive from the fact that they are often worn with the pouch above the buttocks, for which \"fanny\" and \"bum\" are the slang terms in each country respectively, although they may also be worn with the pouch at the front. The British and Irish usage of \"fanny\" is vulgar slang for the vulva, so the name \"fanny pack\" is rarely used in Australia, Britain, Canada, and Ireland.\n\nHistorically, the bag was positioned in front of the body, so people could protect themselves from bandits. Bags attached to belts have been in use since antiquity in many cultures. One origin was the Native American buffalo pouch which was used instead of sewing pockets into clothing. Buffalo pouches may also be worn on the wrist or carried on the front of the chest via a neck strap or lanyard. Ãtzi had a belt pouch 5000 years ago. The European medieval belt-pouch is another antecedent which was superseded as clothing came to have pockets. The Scottish sporran is a similar belted pouch that survived because of the impracticality of pockets in a kilt.\n\nThe modern version made from synthetic materials came into use in the 1980s and they were especially in vogue in the 1990s, but gradually their use fell into decline in the 2000s. Their use was satirised by the American humorist Weird Al Yankovic in his song \"White & Nerdy\".\n\nIn 2012, calling them \"belted satchels\" or \"hands-free bags\", several designer labels sought to bring the accessory back by offering stylish and expensive designs selling for as much as $1995.\n\nIn 2020, fanny packs are now more popular than ever. Unlike handbags, they do not have to be carried, and unlike backpacks, they do not put undue strain on the back. Often referred to as \"waist bags\", they tend to be worn cross body rather than around the waist. Fashion houses such as Chanel and Gucci are at the forefront of the trend. The practicality of fanny packs is particularly popular in \"festival fashion\" where outfits tend to be more extravagant.\n\nMobile devices (and USB charging cables and backup batteries), bottles of water, snacks, tissue paper, first aid, isopropyl alcohol, contact lenses, and pepper spray are among some of the most common items stored in the bag. Fanny packs designed for concealed carry of a weapon are available.\n\nIn other cultures, they are known as banana bags (in France) and kidney bags (in Spain), while in Italy it is called the \"marsupio\", from the marsupium. Variations include the wristpack, which is essentially a fanny pack for the wrist.\n\nIn July 2018, \"The Boston Globe\" reported that fanny packs are back in vogue with new packs introduced by fashion designers Gucci, Prada, and Louis Vuitton. The designer packs retail for up to $1500 and are being worn by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, Jaden Smith, and Russell Westbrook. This time around, the packs can be worn around the waist or worn cross-body. \"Vogue\" magazine reported on the trend by writing \"Alas, due to our odd fascination with ugly throwback clothing, the fanny pack has been vindicated.\" \n"}

He played for 15 seasons in Major League Baseball as a catcher in and then from through , most notably as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won four American League pennants and two World Series championships between 1966 and 1971. A two-time All-Star, Etchebarren also played for the California Angels and the Milwaukee Brewers. After his playing career, he became a coach and managed 16 seasons in the Minor Leagues.\n\nEtchebarren was born in Whittier, California of Basque descent. He was signed by the Baltimore Orioles as an amateur free agent in 1961. Expected to be the Orioles' third-string catcher entering his MLB rookie season in 1966, he became the starter in spring training when Dick Brown and Charley Lau underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor and remedy an ailing elbow respectively in the same timeframe. Etchebarren was the last man to bat against Sandy Koufax, when he hit into a double play during the sixth inning of Game 2 of the 1966 World Series. Etchebarren helped the Orioles to win the 1966 and 1970 World Series, 1969 and 1971 AL pennants, and the 1973 and 1974 AL Eastern Division championships.\n\nHe was named to the 1966 and 1967 AL All-Star Teams. Etchebarren finished 17th in voting for the 1966 AL MVP for playing in 121 games, having 412 at bats, 49 runs, 91 hits, 14 doubles, 6 triples, 11 home runs, 50 RBI, 38 walks, a .221 batting average, a .293 on-base percentage, a .364 slugging percentage, 150 total bases, 3 sacrifice flies, and 12 intentional walks.\n\nAfter Etchebarren lost his starting catcher position to Dave Duncan due to injuries during the first week of the 1975 season, his contract was sold by the Orioles to the California Angels at the trade deadline on June 15. He had threatened to retire if he was not sent to his native state of California.\n\nIn 15 seasons he played in 948 games and had 2,618 at-bats, 245 runs, 615 hits, 101 doubles, 17 triples, 49 home runs, 309 RBI, 13 stolen bases, 246 walks, .235 batting average, .306 on-base percentage, .343 slugging percentage, 897 total bases, 20 sacrifice hits, 19 sacrifice flies and 41 intentional walks. Defensively, he recorded a .987 fielding percentage.\n\nEtchebarren became the Milwaukee Brewersâ Minor League catching instructor in 1982. He was the Orioles bench coach from 1996 to 1997 under manager Davey Johnson. In 2000 Etchebarren was manager of the Bowie Baysox of the Eastern League, in 2001 and 2002 Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He served as manager of the Aberdeen IronBirds of the New YorkâPenn League for three seasons until his dismissal from that position on October 22, 2007. He was the manager of the York Revolution of the Atlantic League and led the team to a pair of league championships in 2010 and 2011. He retired from baseball following the 2012 season.

{"id": "1928813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928813", "title": "Anticausative verb", "text": "Anticausative verb\n\nAn anticausative verb (abbreviated ) is an intransitive verb that shows an event affecting its subject, while giving no semantic or syntactic indication of the cause of the event. The single argument of the anticausative verb (its subject) is a patient, that is, what undergoes an action. One can assume that there is a cause or an agent of causation, but the syntactic structure of the anticausative makes it unnatural or impossible to refer to it directly. Examples of anticausative verbs are \"break\", \"sink\", \"move\", etc.\n\nAnticausative verbs are a subset of unaccusative verbs. Although the terms are generally synonymous, some unaccusative verbs are more obviously anticausative, while others (\"fall\", \"die\", etc.) are not; it depends on whether causation is defined as having to do with an animate volitional agent (does \"falling\" mean \"being accelerated down by gravity\" or \"being dropped/pushed down by someone\"? Is \"old age\" a causation agent for \"dying\"?).\n\nA distinction must be made between anticausative and autocausative verbs. A verb is anticausative if the agent is unspecified but assumed to be external (or even if its existence is denied), and it is autocausative if the agent is the same as the patient. Many Indo-European languages lack separate morphological markings for these two classes, and the correct class needs to be derived from context:\n\n\n\nIn English, many anticausatives are of the class of \"alternating ambitransitive verbs\", where the alternation between transitive and intransitive forms produces a change of the position of the patient role (the transitive form has a patientive direct object, and this becomes the patientive subject in the intransitive). This phenomenon is called causative alternation. For example:\n\n\nPassive voice is not an anticausative construction. In passive voice, the agent of causation is demoted from its position as a core argument (the subject), but it can optionally be re-introduced using an adjunct (in English, commonly, a \"by\"-phrase). In the examples above, \"The window was broken\", \"The ship was sunk\" would clearly indicate causation, though without making it explicit.\n\nIn the Romance languages, many anticausative verbs are formed through a \"pseudo-reflexive\" construction, using a clitic pronoun (which is identical to the non-emphatic reflexive pronoun) applied on a transitive verb. For example (in Spanish, using the clitic \"se\"):\n\n\nAnother example in French:\n\n\nIn the Slavic languages, the use is essentially the same as in the Romance languages. For example (in Croatian, using \"se\"):\n\n\nIn East Slavic languages (such as Old Church Slavonic and Russian), the pronoun \"se\" becomes suffixes \"sya\" (or \"s\"' after a vowel in Russian).\n\n\n\nThe suffix \"sya\" has a large number of uses and does not necessarily denote anticausativity (or even intransitivity). However, in most cases it denotes either passive voice or one of the subclasses of reflexivity (anticausativity, reciprocity, etc.)\n\nThere is a class of verbs (deponent verbs, \"Ð¾ÑÐ»Ð¾Ð¶Ð¸ÑÐµÐ»ÑÐ½ÑÐµ Ð³Ð»Ð°Ð³Ð¾Ð»Ñ\" \"otlozhitel'nye glagoly\") which \"only\" exist in this reflexive form (the suffix \"sya\" can't be removed). These are commonly anticausative or autocausative, and commonly refer to emotions, behavior, or factors outside one's control.\n\n\nIn addition, a verb may be put into an unaccusative/anticausative form by forming an impersonal sentence, with the verb typically either in its past tense neuter form, or in its present tense third person form:\n\n\nHere as well there is a class of \"impersonal verbs\", which only exist in this impersonal form:\n\n\nIn the Arabic language the form VII has the anticausative meaning. \n\nUrdu also abounds in such verbs. A very large number of antiaccusative verbs are used in it.\n\nIn Standard Japanese, productive morphology highly favors transitivization, in the sense that it has productive causitivization, but no anticausitivization. In the Hokkaido dialects and Northern TÅhoku dialect, however, the anticausative morpheme /rasar/ is employed with some verbs, such as \"maku\" 'to roll', \"tsumu\" 'to load', and \"okuru\" 'to send' as a means of producing an intransitive verb from a transitive verb.\n\nBardi is an Australian Aboriginal language in the Nyulnyulan family which uses the root \"-jiidi-\" 'go' to denote anticausatives as part of complex predicate constructions. For example, whereas one might causatively 'close' a door with the following construction:\n\n\na door might 'close' with the following construction\n\n\nIn the underived construction, the light verb \"-ma-\" \"put\" is used with a coverb (or preverb) \"boonda\" 'close'. In the anti-causative construction, the light verb reduces the valency of the predicate and the item which is closed becomes the subject. This is a regular alternation among complex predicates.\n\n\n"}

The name SO(10) is conventional among physicists, and derives from the Lie group SO(10), which is a special orthogonal group that is double covered by Spin(10).\n\nBefore the SU(5) theory behind the GeorgiâGlashow model, Harald Fritzsch and Peter Minkowski, and independently Howard Georgi, found that all the matter contents are incorporated into a single representation, spinorial 16 of SO(10). However, it is worth noting that Georgi found the SO(10) theory just a few hours before finding SU(5) at the end of 1973.\n\nIt has the branching rules to [SU(5)ÃU(1)]/Z.\nIf the hypercharge is contained within SU(5), this is the conventional GeorgiâGlashow model, with the 16 as the matter fields, the 10 as the electroweak Higgs field and the 24 within the 45 as the GUT Higgs field. The superpotential may then include renormalizable terms of the form \"Tr\"(45 â 45); \"Tr\"(45 â 45 â 45); 10 â 45 â 10, 10 â 16* â 16 and 16* â 16. The first three are responsible to the gauge symmetry breaking at low energies and give the Higgs mass, and the latter two give the matter particles masses and their Yukawa couplings to the Higgs.\n\nThere is another possible branching, under which the hypercharge is a linear combination of an SU(5) generator and Ï. This is known as flipped SU(5).\n\nAnother important subgroup is either [SU(4) Ã SU(2) Ã SU(2)]/Z or Z â [SU(4) Ã SU(2) Ã SU(2)]/Z depending upon whether or not the left-right symmetry is broken, yielding the PatiâSalam model, whose branching rule is\n\nThe symmetry breaking of SO(10) is usually done with a combination of (( a 45 OR a 54) AND ((a 16 AND a formula_5) OR (a 126 AND a formula_6)) ).\n\nLet's say we choose a 54. When this Higgs field acquires a GUT scale VEV, we have a symmetry breaking to Z â [SU(4) Ã SU(2) Ã SU(2)]/Z, i.e. the PatiâSalam model with a Z left-right symmetry.\n\nIf we have a 45 instead, this Higgs field can acquire any VEV in a two dimensional subspace without breaking the standard model. Depending on the direction of this linear combination, we can break the symmetry to SU(5)ÃU(1), the GeorgiâGlashow model with a U(1) (diag(1,1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1)), flipped SU(5) (diag(1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1)), SU(4)ÃSU(2)ÃU(1) (diag(0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,-1,-1)), the minimal left-right model (diag(1,1,1,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,0)) or SU(3)ÃSU(2)ÃU(1)ÃU(1) for any other nonzero VEV.\n\nThe choice diag(1,1,1,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,0) is called the Dimopoulos-Wilczek mechanism aka the missing VEV mechanism and it is proportional to BâL.\n\nThe choice of a 16 and a formula_5 breaks the gauge group down to the GeorgiâGlashow SU(5). The same comment applies to the choice of a 126 and a formula_6.\n\nIt is the combination of BOTH a 45/54 and a 16/formula_9 or 126/formula_10 which breaks SO(10) down to the Standard Model.\n\nThe electroweak Higgs doublets come from an SO(10) 10. Unfortunately, this same 10 also contains triplets. The masses of the doublets have to be stabilized at the electroweak scale, which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the GUT scale whereas the triplets have to be really heavy in order to prevent triplet-mediated proton decays. See doublet-triplet splitting problem.\n\nAmong the solutions for it is the Dimopoulos-Wilczek mechanism, or the choice of diag(0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,-1,-1) of <45>. Unfortunately, this is not stable once the 16/formula_9 or 126/formula_10 sector interacts with the 45 sector.\n\nThe matter representations come in three copies (generations) of the 16 representation. The Yukawa coupling is 10 16 16. This includes a right-handed neutrino. We can either include three copies of singlet representations Ï and a Yukawa coupling formula_13 (see double seesaw mechanism) or add the Yukawa interaction formula_14 or add the nonrenormalizable coupling formula_15. See seesaw mechanism.\n\nNote that SO(10) contains both the GeorgiâGlashow SU(5) and flipped SU(5).\n\n"}

Lined by bars, shops, restaurants, nature, public artwork, and the five historic missions, the River Walk is an important part of the city's urban fabric and a tourist attraction in its own right.\n\nThe River Walk is a successful special-case pedestrian street, one level down from the automobile street. The River Walk winds and loops under bridges as two parallel sidewalks lined with restaurants and shops, connecting the major tourist draws from the Shops at Rivercenter, to the Arneson River Theatre, to Marriage Island, to La Villita, to HemisFair Park, to the Tower Life Building, to the San Antonio Museum of Art, to the Pearl and the city's five Spanish colonial missions, which have been named a World Heritage Site, including the Alamo. During the annual springtime Fiesta San Antonio, the River Parade features flowery floats that float down the river.\n\nIn September 1921, a disastrous flood along the San Antonio River took 51 lives, with an additional 23 people reported missing. Plans were then developed for flood control of the river. Among the plans was to build an upstream dam (Olmos Dam)and bypass a prominent bend of the river in the Downtown area (between present day Houston Street and Villita Parkway), then to pave over the bend, and create a storm sewer.\n\nWork began on the Olmos Dam and bypass channel in 1926; however, the San Antonio Conservation Society successfully protested the paved sewer option. No major plans came into play until 1929, when San Antonio native and architect Robert Hugman submitted his plans for what would become the River Walk. Although many have been involved in development of the site, the leadership of former mayor Jack White was instrumental in passage of a bond issue that raised funds to empower the 1938 \"San Antonio River Beautification Project\", which began the evolution of the site into the present 2.5-mile-long (4 km) River Walk.\n\nHugman endorsed the bypass channel idea (which would be completed later that year) but, instead of paving over the bend, Hugman suggested 1) a flood gate at the northern (upstream) end of the bend; 2) a small dam at the southern (downstream) end of the bend; and 3) a Tainter gate in the channel to regulate flow. The bend would then be surrounded by commercial development, which he titled \"The Shops of Aragon and Romula\". Hugman went as far as to maintain his architect's office along the bend.\n\nHugman's plan was initially not well-received â the area was noted for being dangerous. At one point, it was declared off-limits to military personnel. People were warned of the threat of being \"drowned like a rat\" should the river flood. However, over the next decade support for commercial development of the river bend grew, and crucial funding came in 1939 under the Works Progress Administration (WPA) which resulted in the initial construction of a network of some of walkways, about twenty bridges, and extensive plantings including some of the bald cypress (others are several hundred years old) whose branches stretch up to ten stories and are visible from street level.\n\nHugman's persistence paid off; he was named project architect. His plan would be put to the test in 1946, when another major flood threatened Downtown San Antonio, but the Olmos Dam and bypass channel minimized the area damage. Casa Rio, a landmark River Walk restaurant, became the first restaurant in the area in 1946, opening next door to Hugman's office.\n\nThrough the following decades the network has been improved and extended. The first major extension of the Riverwalk was constructed by the joint venture of two general contractors Darragh & Lyda Inc. and H. A. Lott Inc. to Tower of the Americas as part of HemisFair '68. The expansion extended the Riverwalk beyond its natural banks at the horseshoe bend to the new convention center and theater by excavating much of the block bordered by Commerce, Bowie, Market and Alamo Streets. That was also the year the Hilton Palacio del Rio was built, the first of many downtown hotels that leverage their slice of urban \"riverfront.\" A subsequent major expansion opened in 1988 that extended a branch from the 1968 extension to create a lagoon at the new Rivercenter Mall and the Marriott Rivercenter Hotel.\n\nIn 1981 the Hyatt Regency San Antonio opened with a new pedestrian connector that linked Alamo Plaza to the River Walk with concrete waterfalls, waterways and indigenous landscaping. Known as the Paseo del Alamo, this river \"extension\" actually flows from Alamo Plaza into the San Antonio River through the atrium of the hotel. This connector not only allows the hotel to market itself as being on Alamo Plaza and on the River Walk, but it provides the city with an urban park that connects the city's two largest tourist attractions.\n\nMany downtown buildings like the Casino Club Building have street entrances and separate river entrances one level below. This separates the automotive service grid (for delivery and emergency vehicles) and pedestrian traffic below, and creating an intricate network of bridges, walkways, and old staircases. The San Antonio Spurs had their five NBA Championship victory parades/cruises along the river.\n\nExpansion plans are planned for areas of the river north and south of Downtown. As chain restaurants and establishments have begun to flourish, now taking up about a third of commercial space, talk has begun at City Hall about limiting their existence on the River Walk and keeping a distinctively local flair. On May 30, 2009, the city opened the $72 million Museum Reach. The Museum Reach features local attractions such as the San Antonio Museum of Art and The Pearl Brewery, which has become one of the most popular areas for locals.\n\nTwo years later, in May 2011, the River Walk was extended by several miles to extend from Downtown to Mission Espada which is on the city's south side. This addition (named the \"Mission Reach\") is notable for its emphasis on ecological controls and improvements, as well as trail improvements to support both hiking and biking. The Mission Reach has paddling trails and biking trails which allow tourists to experience the UNESCO World Heritage Missions.\n\nAfter years of murmuring from locals and tourists about the water's quality, talk has also begun about cleaning up the water, although the muddy bottom and silt deposits make this difficult. The muddy bottom does receive an annual cleaning during the Mud Festival.\n\nIn early 2016, for the first time in its history, the River Walk was connected with another linear urban walkway, the San Pedro Creek Greenway. The greenway joins with the River Walk at the confluence of the San Pedro Creek and the San Antonio River near Mission ConcepciÃ³n.\n\nOn May 25, 2017, Esperanza Andrade, a former Texas secretary of state, and Lisa Wong, her business partner in the company Go Rio San Antonio, prevailed inÂ a 10-1 vote from the San Antonio City Council for the $100 million contract to operate the barges on the River Walk. The only dissenter on the council was the mayoral candidate Ron Nirenberg, who opposes Mayor Ivy Taylor in a runoff election on June 10. In selecting Andrade and Wong, theÂ council rejectedÂ City Manager Sheryl Sculley's recommendation to award theÂ contract instead to the Chicago-based Entertainment Cruises, the choice also of former Mayor Phil Hardberger. On receiving the contract, Andrade told Taylor and the council: \"We not only know but we understand why the River Walk is indeed our crown jewel of our beautiful city. And we understand that the barge operation is the thread that weaves it all together.\"Â \n\nThe River Walk has inspired similar projects in other cities, such as the Little Sugar Creek Greenway in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Cherry Creek Greenway in Denver, Colorado, The Bricktown Canal in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and the Santa LucÃ­a Riverwalk in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928841", "title": "Legio X Fretensis", "text": "Legio X Fretensis\n\nLegio X Fretensis (\"Tenth legion of the Strait\") was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. It was founded by the young Gaius Octavius (later to become Augustus Caesar) in 41/40 BC to fight during the period of civil war that started the dissolution of the Roman Republic. X \"Fretensis\" is then recorded to have existed at least until the 410s.\n\nX \"Fretensis\" symbols were the bull â the holy animal of the goddess Venus (mythical ancestor of the gens Julia) â a ship (probably a reference to the Battles of Naulochus and/or Actium), the god Neptune, and a boar. The symbol of Taurus may also mean that it was organized between 20 April and 20 May.\n\nOctavian, later known as Augustus, levied a legion and gave it the number ten, as a reference to Julius Caesar's famous Tenth Legion.\n\nIn 36 BC, the Tenth Legion fought under Octavian against Sextus Pompey in the Battle of Naulochus, where it earned its \"cognomen\" \"Fretensis\". The name refers to the fact that the battle took place near the sea Strait of Messina (\"Fretum Siculum\").\n\nIn 31 BC, it fought in the Battle of Actium against Mark Antony. Although Actium was a battle at sea, the legion was able to board enemy ships that had been hooked close by means of an iron grapnel known as the Corvus. Its key participation in this battle is probably the reason that the legion also used a trireme as one of its symbols. Actium marked the end of the civil war and the rise to power of Octavian, who was proclaimed Augustus some years later.\n\nIt uncertain when the legion was redeployed to Macedonia. An inscription found in the valley of the Strymon river attests that a group of soldiers from the unit had built a bridge. While stationed in that province, it fought battles with the Sarmatae who attacked the province in 16 BC. Not much later, Legio X \"Fretensis\" went to Syria. An inscription in the temple of Bel in Palmyra dated AD 14-19, signed by the commander of the legion, was dedicated to members of the emperor's family. This has led experts to believe X \"Fretensis\" took part in Germanicus' campaign in the East, as well that the legion was stationed at Zeugma to secure the frontier with Parthia.\n\nIn the year 6 CE, Publius Sulpicius Quirinus, governor of Syria, led X \"Fretensis\" and III \"Gallica\", VI \"Ferrata\", and XII \"Fulminata\" in suppressing the revolt that sprung out after the deposition of Herod Archelaus. \n\nUnder Nero in 58-63 CE, X \"Fretensis\" participated in the campaigns of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo against the Parthians.\n\nX \"Fretensis\" was centrally involved in the First Jewish-Roman War (66â73), under the supreme command of Vespasian.\n\nIn 66, the X \"Fretensis\" and V \"Macedonica\" went to Alexandria for an invasion of Ethiopia planned by Nero. However, the two legions were needed in Judaea to suppress a revolt. After spending the winter in Ptolemais Ace (modern Acre, Israel), X \"Fretensis\" and V \"Macedonica\" relocated in the coastal city of Caesarea Maritima (67/68). This was due to the large number of legions being mobilized in Ptolemais, under Marcus Ulpius Traianus, future governor of Syria and father of the emperor Trajan. During that same winter, the Caesarea camp of Xth and Vth hosted Vespasian, who was forced to go to Rome the following year, where he seized power. Vespasian's son Titus finished the suppression of the revolt.\n\nWhen Tarichacae and Gamla were conquered, the X \"Fretensis\" moved to Scythopolis (modern Bet She'an), just west of the Jordan River. In the summer of 68, X \"Fretensis\" destroyed the monastery of Qumran, where the Dead Sea Scrolls are believed to have originated. Its winter camp was at Jericho.\nBy 70, the rebellion in all of Judaea had been crushed, except for Jerusalem and a few fortresses, including Masada. In that year X \"Fretensis\", in conjunction with V \"Macedonica\", XII \"Fulminata\", and XV \"Apollinaris\", began the siege of Jerusalem, stronghold of the rebellion. The Xth camped on the Mount of Olives. During the siege, Legio X gained fame in the effective use of their various war machines. It was noted that they were able to hurl stones that weighted a talent (about 25Â kg) a distance of two furlongs (400 m) or further. The projectiles of their ballistae caused heavy damage to the ramparts. According to Josephus (vol. III of his history of the Judaean war), Larcius Lepidus was the commanding officer of the X Legion. The siege of Jerusalem lasted five months and the besieged population experienced all the terrible rigors of starvation. Finally, the combined assaults of the legions succeeded in taking the city, which was then subjected to destruction.\nDuring the spring of 71, Titus set sail for Rome. A new military governor was then appointed from Rome, Lucilius Bassus, whose assigned task was to undertake the \"mopping-up\" operations in Judaea. Naturally, he used X \"Fretensis\" to oppose the few remaining fortresses that still resisted. As part of this, X \"Fretensis\" took Herodium, and then crossed the Jordan to capture the fortress of Machaerus on the shore of the Dead Sea. Due to illness, Bassus did not live to complete his mission. Lucius Flavius Silva replaced him, and moved against the last Jewish stronghold, Masada, probably in the autumn of 72. He used Legio X, auxiliary troops, and thousands of Jewish prisoners. After his orders for surrender were rejected, Silva established several base camps and a wall of circumvallation completely around the fortress. When the Romans finally broke through the walls of this citadel, they discovered that the Jewish defenders had chosen death with a mass suicide.\nAfter the conclusion of the Jewish revolt, Legio X was garrisoned at Jerusalem. Their main camp was positioned on the Western Hill, located in the southern half of what is now the Old City, which had been levelled of all former buildings. The camp of the Tenth was built using the surviving portions of the walls of Herod's royal palace, demolished by order of Titus. Once the Romans rebuilt parts of the destroyed city as the pagan city of \"Aelia Capitolina\", the camp found itself at the end of the \"cardo maximus\".\n\nAt the time, Legio X was the sole legion assigned to maintain the peace in Judaea, and was directly under the command of the governor of the province, who was also legatus of the legion. This combination of offices made this posting important, and several of the men assigned to it had previous experience commanding a legion. However, when a second legion was assigned to Judaea, and the province promoted to consular status, the political status of legate of this legion declined; as Dabrowa observes, \"he was subordinate to the governor of Judaea just like the commander of the second legion.\n\nAfter participating in Trajan's Parthian campaign, \"Fretensis\" was caught up in the Bar Kokhba's revolt (132-135).\n\nA possible cause for the revolt was the decision of Emperor Hadrian to build a pagan temple to Jupiter in Jerusalem. Simon Bar Kokhba started the revolt and inflicted massive casualties on the Romans. The war ended when the Roman army â including \"Fretensis\" and Danubian troops under the command of Sextus Julius Severus â reconquered the entire territory and successfully besieged the last Jewish stronghold, the fortress of Betar. Legio X Fretensis sustained heavy casualties in the course of the revolt.\n\nAs a consequence of the unrest in the region, \"Fretensis\" was supported by several other legions, of which the Legio VI \"Ferrata\" was stationed at a camp which became known as Lejjun (from \"legion\").\n\nA vexillation, or detachment, of X \"Fretensis\" along with other troops stationed in eastern provinces, fought in the Marcomannic campaign of Marcus Aurelius. However, when this vexillation arrived or what part it played in the campaign is not known.\n\nIn 193, the legion supported Pescennius Niger against Septimius Severus, and was possibly involved in a local struggle between Jews and Samaritans. The legion was still in Jerusalem at the time of Caracalla (r. 211â217) or Elagabalus (r. 218â222).\n\nUnder Gallienus (r. 253â268), another vexillation of \"Fretensis\" was drawn to fight in the war against the Gallic Empire. However, that unit defected to the other side.\n\nThe legion moved to Aila (close to modern Aqaba), probably during Diocletian's reforms (around 300), and is recorded as still camping there at the time of the compilation of the \"Notitia Dignitatum\" in the 390s, when it is reported serving under the \"Dux Palaestinae\".\n\nA Latin inscription of the end of the 2nd century, found in the church of Abu Ghosh (at 15Â km west of Jerusalem) marks the presence of a \"vexillatio\" (detachment) of X \"Fretensis\":\n\nSome fragments bearing the \"L.X.F\" mark of the \"L\"egio \"X\" \"F\"retensis are present at the Tower of David in Jerusalem. Roman Law required all pottery to bear the maker's stamp, and the Legion pottery works just to the West of Jerusalem were obviously no exception. A huge production of pottery bearing the marks of the Legio X \"Fretensis\" has been discovered in Jerusalem.\nThe mark \"LE X FR\" was also used in the pottery of the Legion.\n\n\n\n"}

Fisher was Professor Emeritus at the Annenberg School for Communication.\n\nFisher's body of work is based on the concept that people are essentially storytellers, referred to as narrative theory. Storytelling is one of the oldest and most universal forms of communication and so Fisher propounded that individuals approach their social world in a narrative mode and make decisions and act within this narrative framework\n\nNarrative theory was developed by Walter Fisher. Fisher obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Iowa in 1960 and went on to become a professor, among other things. Perhaps Fisherâs most notable contribution was his formulation of the narrative approach to rhetoric and communication theory. In 1979 he was awarded the Golden Anniversary Monograph Award from the Speech Communication Association for the article that introduced narrative theory to the field of communication. However, as is the case with most new theories, narrative theory was not totally accepted by the discipline (Miller, 2005, p.Â 92). Narrative theory clashed with several pre-existing beliefs as to the nature of human beings and how they communicate and act. Fisher describes this contrast by identifying the tenets of what he sees as two universal paradigms: the rational world paradigm, and the narrative paradigm (Fisher, 1987).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Roberts has authored the majority opinion in several landmark cases, including \"Shelby County v. Holder\", \"National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\", \"King v. Burwell\", and \"Department of Commerce v. New York\". He has been described as having a conservative judicial philosophy in his jurisprudence but has shown a willingness to work with the Supreme Court's liberal bloc, and since the retirement of Anthony Kennedy in 2018 has come to be regarded as a key swing vote on the Court.\n\nRoberts grew up in northwestern Indiana and was educated in Catholic schools. He studied history at Harvard University and then attended Harvard Law School, where he became the managing editor of the \"Harvard Law Review\". He served as a law clerk for Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and then-associate justice William Rehnquist before taking a position in the attorney general's office during the Reagan Administration. He went on to serve the Reagan administration and the George H. W. Bush administration in the Department of Justice and the Office of the White House Counsel, before spending 14 years in private law practice. During this time, he argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court. Notably, he represented 19 states in \"United States v. Microsoft Corp.\"\n\nIn 2003, Roberts was appointed as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by George W. Bush. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own. In 2005, Roberts was nominated to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court, initially to succeed the retiring Sandra Day O'Connor. When Rehnquist died before Roberts's confirmation hearings began, Bush instead nominated Roberts to fill the Chief Justice position. Bush would later appoint Samuel Alito to the Associate Justice position that was originally for Roberts.\n\nJohn Glover Roberts Jr. was born on January 27, 1955, in Buffalo, New York, the son of Rosemary (\"nÃ©e\" Podrasky; 1929â2019) and John Glover \"Jack\" Roberts Sr. (1928â2008). His father had Irish and Welsh ancestry and his mother was of Slovak descent. He has an elder sister, Kathy, and two younger sisters, Peggy and Barbara. Roberts spent his early childhood years in Hamburg, New York, where his father worked as an electrical engineer for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at its large factory in Lackawanna. In 1965, when Roberts was ten years old, his family moved to Long Beach, Indiana, so his father could take a job as the plant manager for a new Bethlehem Steel plant in nearby Burns Harbor.\n\nFrom an early age, Roberts \"stood out as the smartest kid in class.\" He first attended Notre Dame Elementary School, then attended La Lumiere School, a small but affluent and academically rigorous Roman Catholic boarding school in La Porte, Indiana, where he was a student and athlete. He studied five years of Latin in four years of study, necessitating the Latin teacher's creation of a one-on-one advanced curriculum for him, and was known generally for his devotion to his studies. One classmate recalled finding Roberts studying at both 8:00 am and 8:00 pm, and that he \"would be physically exhausted at the end of each evening from studying.\" He was captain of his school's football teamhe later described himself as a \"slow-footed linebacker\"and was a regional champion in wrestling. He participated in choir and drama, co-edited the school newspaper, and served on the athletic council and the executive committee of the student council. Roberts graduated first in his class from La Lumiere in 1973.\n\nAfter graduating from La Lumiere, Roberts became the first student in the school's history to be admitted to Harvard University. Due to his academic excellence in high school, Roberts entered Harvard with sophomore (second-year) standing. He majored in history, and one of his first papers, \"Marxism and Bolshevism: Theory and Practice,\" won Harvard's William Scott Ferguson Prize for most outstanding essay by a sophomore history major. Roberts spent three years as an undergraduate at Harvard, returning to Indiana each summer to earn money working on the floor of the steel plant his father managed. In his senior year, his paper \"The Utopian Conservative: A Study of Continuity and Change in the Thought of Daniel Webster\" won Harvard's 1976 Bowdoin Prize for the \"English Language\" category. He graduated from Harvard in 1976 with an A.B. \"summa cum laude\" and membership in Phi Beta Kappa, having written a senior honors thesis entitled \"Old and New Liberalism: The British Liberal Party's Approach to the Social Problem, 19061914.\"\n\nRoberts had originally planned to pursue a Ph.D. in history and become a professor but decided to attend law school instead. He remained at Harvard and attended Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the \"Harvard Law Review\" and served as its managing editor during his third year. He graduated in 1979 with a J.D. \"magna cum laude\".\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Roberts first clerked for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1979 to 1980, then clerked for Justice (later Chief Justice in 1986) William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1980 to 1981. After his clerkships, Roberts began working for the U.S. government in the administration of President Ronald Reagan, first from 1981 to 1982 as a special assistant to William French Smith, the U.S. Attorney General, then from 1982 to 1986 as an associate with the White House Counsel.\n\nIn 1986, Roberts entered private law practice in Washington, D.C., as an associate at the law firm Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells) and worked in the field of corporate law. As part of Hogan & Hartson's pro bono practice, he worked behind the scenes for gay rights advocates, reviewing filings and preparing arguments for the 1996 Supreme Court case \"Romer v. Evans\", which was described in 2005 as \"the movement's most important legal victory\". Roberts also argued on behalf of the homeless, a case which became one of Roberts's \"few appellate losses.\" Another pro bono matter was a death penalty case in which he represented John Ferguson, who was convicted of killing eight people in Florida.\n\nIn 1989, Roberts joined the administration of newly elected president George H. W. Bush as Principal Deputy Solicitor General. He served as the acting solicitor general for the purposes of at least one case when the sitting solicitor general, Ken Starr, had a conflict of interest. In 1992, Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but no Senate vote was held, and Roberts's nomination expired at the end of the 102nd Congress. \n\nRoberts left the Office of the Solicitor General in 1993 following Bush's defeat by Bill Clinton in the 1992 U.S. presidential election, and returned to Hogan & Hartson as a partner. He became the head of the firm's appellate practice, and also became an adjunct professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center. During this time, Roberts argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court, prevailing in 25 of them. He represented 19 states in \"United States v. Microsoft\". Those cases include:\n\nDuring the late 1990s, while working for Hogan & Hartson, Roberts served as a member of the steering committee of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the conservative Federalist Society.\n\nIn 2000, Roberts traveled to Tallahassee, Florida, to advise Jeb Bush, then the governor of Florida, concerning the latter's actions in the Florida election recount during the presidential election.\n\nOn May 9, 2001, President George W. Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the D.C. Circuit to replace Judge James L. Buckley, who had recently retired. However, the Democratic Party had a majority in the Senate at the time and was in conflict with Bush over his judicial nominees. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy refused to give Roberts a hearing in the 107th Congress. The GOP regained control of the Senate on January 7, 2003, and Bush resubmitted Roberts's nomination that day. Roberts was confirmed on May 8, 2003, and received his commission on June 2, 2003. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.\n\nNotable decisions on the D.C. Circuit include the following:\n\n\"Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\", 386 F.3d 1148, involved a 12-year-old girl who was arrested, searched, handcuffed, driven to police headquarters, booked, and fingerprinted after she violated a publicly advertised zero tolerance \"no eating\" policy in a Washington Metro station by eating a single french fry. She was released to her mother three hours later. She sued, alleging that an adult would have only received a citation for the same offense, while children must be detained until parents are notified. The D.C. Circuit unanimously affirmed the district court's dismissal of the girl's lawsuit, which was predicated on alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure) and Fifth Amendment (equal protection).\n\n\"No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation,\" Roberts wrote, and noted that the policies under which the girl was apprehended had since been changed. Because age discrimination is evaluated using a rational basis test, however, only weak state interests were required to justify the policy, and the panel concluded they were present. \"Because parents and guardians play an essential role in that rehabilitative process, it is reasonable for the District to seek to ensure their participation, and the method chosenâdetention until the parent is notified and retrieves the childâcertainly does that, in a way issuing a citation might not.\" The court concluded that the policy and detention were constitutional, noting that \"the question before us ... is not whether these policies were a bad idea, but whether they violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution,\" language reminiscent of Justice Potter Stewart's dissent in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\". \"We are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine,\" Stewart had written; \"[w]e are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution. And that, I cannot do.\"\n\nIn \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\", Roberts was part of a unanimous circuit panel overturning the district court ruling and upholding military tribunals set up by the Bush administration for trying terrorism suspects known as enemy combatants. Circuit judge A. Raymond Randolph, writing for the court, ruled that Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a driver for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, could be tried by a military court because:\n\n\nThe court held open the possibility of judicial review of the results of the military commission after the current proceedings ended. This decision was overturned on June 29, 2006, by the Supreme Court in a 5â3 decision, with Roberts not participating due to his prior participation in the case as a circuit judge.\n\nRoberts wrote a dissent in \"Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton\", 323 F.3d 1062, a case involving the protection of a rare California toad under the Endangered Species Act. When the court denied a rehearing en banc, 334 F.3d 1158 (D.C. Cir. 2003), Roberts dissented, arguing that the panel opinion was inconsistent with \"United States v. Lopez\" and \"United States v. Morrison\" in that it incorrectly focused on whether the \"regulation\" substantially affects interstate commerce rather than on whether the regulated \"activity\" does. In Roberts's view, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called \"a hapless toad\" that \"for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\" He said that reviewing the panel decision would allow the court \"alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act that may be more consistent with Supreme Court precedent.\"\n\nOn July 19, 2005, President Bush nominated Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill a vacancy that would be created by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Roberts was the first Supreme Court nominee since Stephen Breyer in 1994. Bush announced Roberts's nomination in a live, nationwide television broadcast from the East Room of the White House at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nChief Justice William H. Rehnquist died on September 3, 2005, while Roberts's confirmation was still pending before the Senate. Shortly thereafter, on September 5, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination as O'Connor's successor and announced Roberts's new nomination to the position of Chief Justice. Bush asked the Senate to expedite Roberts's confirmation hearings to fill the vacancy by the beginning of the Supreme Court's session in early October.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Roberts said that he did not have a comprehensive jurisprudential philosophy, and he did \"not think beginning with an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation is the best way to faithfully construe the document.\" Roberts analogized judges to baseball umpires: \"[I]t's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.\" Roberts demonstrated an encyclopedic knowledge of Supreme Court precedent, which he discussed without notes. Among the issues he discussed were:\n\nIn Senate hearings, Roberts has stated:\n\nRoberts stated the following about federalism in a 1999 radio interview:\n\nAt a Senate hearing, Roberts stated:\n\nOn the subject of \"stare decisis\", referring to \"Brown v. Board\", the decision overturning school segregation, Roberts said that \"the Court in that case, of course, overruled a prior decision. I don't think that constitutes judicial activism because obviously if the decision is wrong, it should be overruled. That's not activism. That's applying the law correctly.\"\n\nWhile working as a lawyer for the Reagan administration, Roberts wrote legal memos defending administration policies on abortion. At his nomination hearing Roberts testified that the legal memos represented the views of the administration he was representing at the time and not necessarily his own. \"Senator, I was a staff lawyer; I didn't have a position,\" Roberts said. As a lawyer in the George H. W. Bush administration, Roberts signed a legal brief urging the court to overturn \"Roe v. Wade\".\n\nIn private meetings with senators before his confirmation, Roberts testified that \"Roe\" was settled law, but added that it was subject to the legal principle of \"stare decisis,\" meaning that while the Court must give some weight to the precedent, it was not legally bound to uphold it.\n\nIn his Senate testimony, Roberts said that, while sitting on the Appellate Court, he had an obligation to respect precedents established by the Supreme Court, including the right to an abortion. He stated: \"\"Roe v. Wade\" is the settled law of the land. ... There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent, as well as \"Casey\".\" Following the traditional reluctance of nominees to indicate which way they might vote on an issue likely to come before the Supreme Court, he did not explicitly say whether he would vote to overturn either, however Jeffrey Rosen adds \"I wouldnât bet on Chief Justice Robertsâs siding unequivocally with the anti-Roe forces.\"\n\nOn September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Roberts's nomination by a vote of 13â5, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein casting the dissenting votes. Roberts was confirmed by the full Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78â22. All Republicans and the one Independent voted for Roberts; the Democrats split evenly, 22â22. Roberts was confirmed by what was, historically, a narrow margin for a Supreme Court justice. However, all subsequent confirmation votes have been even narrower.\n\nRoberts took the Constitutional oath of office, administered by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens at the White House, on September 29, 2005. On October 3, he took the judicial oath provided for by the Judiciary Act of 1789 at the United States Supreme Court building, prior to the first oral arguments of the 2005 term.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said that Roberts \"pretty much run[s] the show the same way\" as Rehnquist, albeit \"let[ting] people go on a little longer at conference ... but [he'll] get over that.\" Roberts has been portrayed as a consistent advocate for conservative principles by analysts such as Jeffrey Toobin. Garrett Epps has described Roberts's prose as \"crystalline, vivid, and often humorous\".\n\nSeventh Circuit judge Diane Sykes, surveying Roberts's first term on the court, concluded that his jurisprudence \"appears to be strongly rooted in the discipline of traditional legal method, evincing a fidelity to text, structure, history, and the constitutional hierarchy. He exhibits the restraint that flows from the careful application of established decisional rules and the practice of reasoning from the case law. He appears to place great stock in the process-oriented tools and doctrinal rules that guard against the aggregation of judicial power and keep judicial discretion in check: jurisdictional limits, structural federalism, textualism, and the procedural rules that govern the scope of judicial review.\" Roberts has been said to operate under an approach of judicial minimalism in his decisions, having stated, \"[i]f it is not necessary to decide more to a case, then in my view it is necessary not to decide more to a case.\" His decision making and leadership demonstrates an intent to preserve the Court's power and legitimacy while dually maintaining judicial independence. Chief Justice Roberts was ranked 50th in the 2016 Forbes ranking of \"The World's Most Powerful People.\"\n\nRoberts is assigned to the following circuits of the US federal courts system: the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the Fourth Circuit (including Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Virginia, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Circuit justices are principally responsible for responding to emergency requests (for example, applications for emergency stays of executions). Prior to confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, Roberts was assigned to cover the Ninth Circuit, but he relinquished these responsibilities during the October 2018 term\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in \"Gonzales v. Oregon\", which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\nOn March 6, 2006, Roberts wrote the unanimous decision in \"Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights\" that colleges accepting federal money must allow military recruiters on campus, despite university objections to the Clinton administration-initiated \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.\n\nFollowing his concurrence in \"Citizens United v. FEC\" (2010), Roberts wrote the majority decision for another landmark campaign finance case called \"McCutcheon v. FEC\" (2014). In \"McCutcheon\" the court ruled that \"aggregate limits\" on the combined amount a donor could give to various federal candidates or party committees violated the First Amendment.\n\nRoberts wrote his first dissent in \"Georgia v. Randolph\" (2006). The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. Roberts criticized the majority opinion as inconsistent with prior case law and for partly basing its reasoning on its perception of social custom. He said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.\n\nIn \"Utah v. Strieff\" (2016), Roberts joined the majority in ruling (5â3) that a person with an outstanding warrant may be arrested and searched, and that any evidence discovered based on that search is admissible in court; the majority opinion held that this remains true even when police act unlawfully by stopping a person without reasonable suspicion, before learning of the existence of the outstanding warrant.\n\nIn \"Carpenter v. United States\", a landmark decision involving privacy of cellular phone data, Roberts wrote the majority opinion in a 5â4 ruling that searches of cellular phone data generally require a warrant.\n\nAlthough Roberts has often sided with Scalia and Thomas, he also provided a crucial vote against their mutual position in \"Jones v. Flowers\", siding with liberal justices of the court in ruling that, before a home is seized and sold in a tax-forfeiture sale, due diligence must be demonstrated and proper notification needs to be sent to the owners. Dissenting justices were Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, while Roberts's opinion was joined by David Souter, Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Samuel Alito did not participate.\n\nOn the Supreme Court, Roberts has indicated he supports some abortion restrictions. In \"Gonzales v. Carhart\" (2007), he voted with the majority to uphold the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished \"Stenberg v. Carhart\", and concluded that the court's previous decision in \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" did not prevent Congress from banning the procedure. The decision left the door open for future as-applied challenges, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the law. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's prior decisions in \"Roe v. Wade\" and \"Casey\" should be reversed; Roberts declined to join that opinion.\n\nIn December 2018, justices Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined the court's four liberal justices in a denial for writ of certiorari, declining to hear a case brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. Because the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, the lower court rulings in favor of Planned Parenthood still stand. In February 2019, Roberts sided with the court's liberal wing, in a 5â4 decision, granting a stay to temporarily block a Louisiana abortion restriction. The Louisiana law required that doctors performing abortions possess admitting privileges at a hospital near the facility providing the abortion, and the stay blocks that law pending review in the legal process.\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Roberts was the deciding vote in a 5â3 decision to stay an execution. On February 7, 2019, Roberts was part of the majority in a 5â4 decision rejecting a Muslim inmate's request to delay execution in order to have an imam present with him during the execution. Also in February, 2019, Roberts sided with Justice Kavanaugh and the court's four liberal justices in a 6â3 decision to block the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.\n\nRoberts opposes the use of race in assigning students to particular schools, including for purposes such as maintaining integrated schools. He sees such plans as discrimination in violation of the constitution's Equal Protection Clause and \"Brown v. Board of Education\". In \"Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1\", the court considered two voluntarily adopted school district plans that relied on race to determine which schools certain children may attend. The court had held in \"Brown\" that \"racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional,\" and later, that \"racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, ... are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests,\" and that this \"[n]arrow tailoring ... require[s] serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.\" Roberts cited these cases in writing for the \"Parents Involved\" majority, concluding that the school districts had \"failed to show that they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals.\" In a section of the opinion joined by four other Justices, Roberts added that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\nRoberts authored the 2007 student free speech case \"Morse v. Frederick\", ruling that a student in a public school-sponsored activity does not have the right to advocate drug use on the basis that the right to free speech does not invariably prevent the exercise of school discipline.\n\nOn April 20, 2010, in \"United States v. Stevens\", the Supreme Court struck down an animal cruelty law. Roberts, writing for an 8â1 majority, found that a federal statute criminalizing the commercial production, sale, or possession of depictions of cruelty to animals, was an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Court held that the statute was substantially overbroad; for example, it could allow prosecutions for selling photos of out-of-season hunting.\n\nOn June 28, 2012, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in \"National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\", which upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a 5â4 vote. The Court indicated that although the \"individual mandate\" component of the Act could not be upheld under the Commerce Clause, the mandate could be construed as a tax and was therefore ruled to be valid under Congress's authority to \"lay and collect taxes.\" The Court overturned a portion of the law related to the withholding of funds from states that did not comply with the expansion of Medicaid; Roberts wrote that \"Congress is not free ... to penalize states that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.\"\nSources within the Supreme Court state that Roberts switched his vote regarding the individual mandate sometime after an initial vote and that Roberts largely wrote both the majority and minority opinions. This extremely unusual circumstance has also been used to explain why the minority opinion was also unsigned, itself a rare phenomenon from the Supreme Court.\n\nRoberts has been compared and contrasted to other court members by commentators. Although Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, his vote in \"National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\" to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast him with the Rehnquist court. Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when \"Bush v. Gore\" is compared to Roberts's vote for the ACA. Roberts's judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas'. He wishes more consensus from the Court. Roberts's voting pattern is most closely aligned to Samuel Alito's.\n\nIn 2013, Roberts wrote the 5-4 majority opinion that the appellants seeking to uphold Proposition 8 in California, which was ruled unconstitutional by lower courts, did not have standing and the lower courts' rulings were allowed to stand and same-sex marriages resumed in California. Roberts dissented in \"United States v. Windsor\" in which the 5-4 majority ruled that key parts of the Defense of Marriage Act were unconstitutional. The case allowed the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages performed in jurisdictions where legal. He dissented in the \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" case in which Kennedy wrote for the majority, again 5-4, that same-sex couples had a right to marry. In \"Pavan v. Smith\", the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision that the state did not have to list same-sex spouses on birth certificates thus siding with same-sex couples who filed the lawsuit; Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissented but Roberts did not join their dissent leaving open speculation that he might have ruled with the majority.\n\nAs the chief justice, Roberts also serves in a variety of non-judicial roles, including chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution and leading the Judicial Conference of the United States. Perhaps the best known of these is the custom of the chief justice administering the oath of office at presidential inaugurations. Roberts debuted in this capacity at the inauguration of Barack Obama on January 20, 2009. (As a senator, Obama had voted against Roberts's confirmation to the Supreme Court, making the event doubly a first: the first time a president was sworn in by someone whose confirmation he opposed.) Things did not go smoothly. According to columnist Jeffrey Toobin:\n\nPart of the difficulty was that Roberts did not have the text of the oath with him but relied on his memory. On later occasions when Roberts has administered an oath, he has taken the text with him.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that \"[l]ater, as the two men shook hands in the Capitol, Roberts appeared to say the mistake was his fault.\" The following evening in the White House Map Room with reporters present, Roberts and Obama repeated the oath correctly. This was, according to the White House, done out of \"an abundance of caution\" to ensure that the constitutional requirement had been met.\n\nIn November 2018, the Associated Press approached Roberts for comment after President Donald Trump described a jurist who ruled against his asylum policy as an \"Obama judge\". In response, Roberts asserted that \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\" Robert's remarks were widely interpreted as a rebuke of President Trump's comments.\n\nChief Justice Roberts presided over the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, which began on January 16 and ended on February 5, 2020.\n\nRoberts and his wife, Jane Sullivan, have been married since 1996. Sullivan is a lawyer who became a prominent legal recruiter at the firms of Major, Lindsey & Africa and Mlegal. Along with Clarence Thomas, she is on the Board of Trustees at her alma mater, the College of the Holy Cross. The couple have two adopted children: John \"Jack\" and Josephine \"Josie\". \n\nRoberts is one of 14 Catholic justicesâout of 114 justices totalâin the history of the Supreme Court. Of those fourteen justices, five (Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, and Brett Kavanaugh) are currently serving. \n\nIn the summer of 2007, Roberts suffered a seizure while he was at his vacation home on Hupper Island off the village of Port Clyde in St. George, Maine. As a result of the seizure he fell on a dock near his house but suffered only minor scrapes. He was taken by private boat to the mainland (which is several hundred yards from the island) and then by ambulance to Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, where he stayed overnight, according to Supreme Court spokesperson Kathy Arberg. Doctors called the incident a benign idiopathic seizure, which means there was no identifiable physiological cause.\n\nRoberts had suffered a similar seizure in 1993. After this first seizure, Roberts temporarily limited some of his activities, such as driving. According to Senator Arlen Specter, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice in 2005, senators were aware of this seizure when they were considering his nomination, but the committee did not think it was significant enough to bring up during his confirmation hearings. Federal judges are not required by law to release information about their health.\n\nAccording to neurologist Marc Schlosberg of Washington Hospital Center, who has no direct connection to the Roberts case, someone who has had more than one seizure without any other cause is by definition determined to have epilepsy. After two seizures, the likelihood of another at some point is greater than 60 percent. Steven Garner of New York Methodist Hospital, who is also uninvolved with the case, said that Roberts's previous history of seizures means that the second incident may be less serious than if this were a newly emerging problem. The Supreme Court said in a statement that Roberts has \"fully recovered from the incident\" and that a neurological evaluation \"revealed no cause for concern.\"\n\nAccording to a 16-page financial disclosure form Roberts submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee prior to his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, his net worth was more than $6Â million, including $1.6Â million in stock holdings. At the time Roberts left private practice to join the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2003, he took a pay cut from $1Â million a year to $171,800; as Chief Justice, his salary is $255,500 as of 2014. Roberts also holds a one-eighth interest in a cottage in Knocklong, an Irish village in County Limerick.\n\nIn August 2010, Roberts sold his stock in Pfizer, which allowed him to participate in two pending cases involving the pharmaceutical maker. Justices are required to recuse themselves in cases in which they own stock of a party.\n\nThe University of Michigan Law Library (External Links, below) has compiled fulltext links to these articles and a number of briefs and arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Neil first appeared in the first episode of the second series of the show as the UK Manager of Wernham Hogg, newly promoted from manager of the Swindon branch, thus making him David Brent's new boss. He was mentioned by name in some episodes of the first series but he did not make an appearance.\n\nAt the start of the second series it is established that Neil has been promoted to the position of UK General Manager to replace Jennifer Taylor-Clarke, the job that Brent was initially offered but did not get due to failing a medical test. Neil's Swindon staff are transferred to Brent's Slough branch, and Neil comes with them.\n\nIt immediately becomes apparent that Neil is all the things that Brent imagines he is himself â charming, humorous and popular. His introductory speech in the first episode of the second series makes everyone laugh. The former Swindon employees respect him for making them work hard. He personally makes lemon drizzle cakes for his employees' birthdays. Chris Finch, Brent's hero, looks up to him and \"borrows\" his best jokes. The motivational speakers who recruit Brent are immediately interested in recruiting Neil too. He is a great dancer, as he demonstrates with a \"Saturday Night Fever\" routine in the fifth episode of the second series. Brent is naturally jealous and resentful, and tries to upstage him at every opportunity. Inevitably Brent just ends up making himself look ridiculous, most notably when he does a dance of his own after Neil's. For the most part Neil responds to Brent's antics with apparent indifference or bemusement, although he is brusque and assertive after Brent calls him pathetic for socializing with the staff â which Brent has been failing miserably to do himself. Professional relations deteriorate rapidly between them as well. Neil reprimands Brent for failing to ensure the former Swindon employees are paid on time and for paying more attention to his motivational speaking \"gigs\" than staff performance and profits, which Brent seems indifferent to. Finally Brent virtually defies Neil to fire him, which he does.\n\nIn the Christmas Special, Neil is clearly annoyed that Brent is continuing to hang around the Slough office. He bars further visits, and a less than pleasant side to his character emerges when he says he is looking forward to meeting Brent's blind date at the Christmas party, guessing almost correctly that Brent will in fact turn up by himself. He is, in other words, setting up Brent for more humiliation and seems somewhat disappointed when Carol, Brent's date, turns out to be attractive, friendly and witty. Arguably, Neil sets up Chris Finch's \"dog\" comment about Carol by asking David about the Labrador he brought in earlier, and he immediately laughs at Chris's joke after he makes it. When Brent finally stands up to Chris by telling him to \"Fuck off,\" Neil gives a furtive, embarrassed glance in the direction of the camera, telling the viewer that he knows it has backfired on him. Brent might have made himself look stupid, but after managing to come across as a down-to-earth, nice man for most of the series, Neil has now made himself look deliberately malicious. This is not the first time his association with Finch works to the detriment of Neil's own affable, politically correct persona: Finch's jokes, which are routinely stolen, or in Chris' words \"borrowed\" from Neil, are usually offensive and in poor taste.\n\nIn an interview with The A.V. Club in January 2007, Ricky Gervais (who created the show and played Brent) said he found Neil to be an unsympathetic figure.\n\nThere's only two people you shouldn't like, and that's Neil and Chris Finch. Finch is a bully, he's one of those people who comes into a room and takes the piss out of someone else, and you laugh, but really you know it's your turn next. And Neil you shouldn't like, because he doesn't care. He was better than David Brent at his job, but it meant less to him than it did to David Brent.\n"}

Following the partition of Judea into tetrarchies in 6 CE, it was gradually absorbed into Roman provinces, with Roman Syria initially annexing the Tetrarchy around 34 AD.\n\nSyrian province forces were directly engaged in the First JewishâRoman War of 66â70 AD. In 66 AD, Cestius Gallus, legate of Syria, brought the Syrian army, based on Legio XII Fulminata, reinforced by auxiliary troops, to restore order in Judaea and quell the revolt. The legion, however, was ambushed and destroyed by Jewish rebels at the Battle of Beth Horon, a result that shocked the Roman leadership. The future emperor Vespasian was then put in charge of subduing the Jewish revolt. In the summer of 69, Vespasian, with the Syrian units supporting him, launched his bid to become Roman emperor. He defeated his rival Vitellius and ruled as emperor for ten years when he was succeeded by his son Titus.\n\nBased on an inscription recovered from Dor in 1948, Gargilius Antiquus was known to have been the governor of a province in the eastern part of the Empire, possibly Syria, between his consulate and governing Asia. In November 2016, an inscription in Greek was recovered off the coast of Dor by Haifa University underwater archaeologists, which attests that Antiquus was governor of the province of Judea between 120 and 130, possibly prior to the Bar Kokhba revolt.\n\nAs related by Theodor Mommsen,\n\n\"Hadrian stationed an extra legion in Judaea, renaming it Syria Palaestina.\" This was following the defeat of the Bar Kokhba Revolt in 135 AD. The Syria-based legion, Legio III Gallica, took part in the quelling of the revolt in 132â136, and in the aftermath, the emperor Hadrian renamed the greatly depopulated province of Judea and its extra legion \"Syria Palaestina\".\n\nSeptimius Severus divided the remainder of the province of Syria into Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice, with Antioch and Tyre as their respective provincial capitals.\n\nAs related by Theodor Mommsen,\nFrom the later 2nd century, the Roman Senate included several notable Syrians, including Claudius Pompeianus and Avidius Cassius.\n\nSyria was of crucial strategic importance during the Crisis of the Third Century. In 244 AD, Rome was ruled by a native Syrian from Philippopolis (modern day Shahba) in the province of Arabia Petraea. The emperor was Marcus Iulius Philippus, more commonly known as Philip the Arab. Philip became the 33rd emperor of Rome upon its millennial celebration.\n\nRoman Syria was invaded in 252/253 (the date is disputed) after a Roman field army was destroyed in the Battle of Barbalissos by the King of Persia Shapur I which left the Euphrates river unguarded and the region was pillaged by the Persians. In 259/260 a similar event happened when Shapur I again defeated a Roman field army and captured the Roman emperor, Valerian, alive at the Battle of Edessa. Again Roman Syria suffered as cities were captured, sacked and pillaged.\n\nFrom 268 to 273, Syria was part of the breakaway Palmyrene Empire.\n\nFollowing the reforms of Diocletian, Syria Coele became part of the Diocese of the East. Sometime between 330 and 350 (likely c. 341), the province of \"Euphratensis\" was created out of the territory of \"Syria Coele\" along the western bank of the Euphrates and the former Kingdom of Commagene, with Hierapolis as its capital.\n\nAfter c. 415 \"Syria Coele\" was further subdivided into \"Syria I\" (or \"Syria Prima\"), with the capital remaining at Antioch, and \"Syria II\" (\"Syria Secunda\") or \"Syria Salutaris\", with capital at Apamea on the Orontes. In 528, Justinian I carved out the small coastal province \"Theodorias\" out of territory from both provinces.\n\nThe region remained one of the most important provinces of the Byzantine Empire. It was occupied by the Sasanians between 609 and 628, then reconquered by the emperor Heraclius, but lost again to the advancing Muslims after the Battle of Yarmouk and the fall of Antioch.\nThe city of Antioch was reconquered by Nikephorus Phocas in 963, along with other parts of the country, at that time under the Hamdanids, although still under the official suzerainty of the Abbasid caliphs and also claimed by the Fatimid caliphs. After emperor John Kurkuas's failed to conquer Syria up to Jerusalem a Muslim \"reconquest\" of Syria followed in the late 970s undertaken by the Fatimid Caliphate which resulted in the ouster of the Byzantines from most parts of Syria. However, Antioch and other northern parts of Syria remained in the empire and other parts were under the protection of the emperors through their Hamdanid, Mirdasid, and Marwanid proxies, until the Seljuk arrival, who after three decades of incursions, conquered Antioch in 1084. Antioch was captured again during the 12th century by the revived armies of the Comnenii. However, by that time the city was regarded as part of Asia Minor and not of Syria.\n\nAncient episcopal sees of the late Roman province of Syria Prima (I) listed in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" as titular sees:\n\nAncient episcopal sees of the late Roman province of Syria Secunda (II) listed in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" as titular sees:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1928876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928876", "title": "An Instinct for Dragons", "text": "An Instinct for Dragons\n\nAn Instinct for Dragons is a book by University of Central Florida anthropologist, David E. Jones, in which he seeks to explain the universality of dragon images in the folklore of human societies. In the introduction, Jones conducts a survey of dragon myths from cultures around the world and argues that certain aspects of dragons or dragon-like mythical creatures are found very widely. He claims that even the Inuit have a reptilian dragon-like monster, even though (living in a frigid environment unsuited for cold-blooded animals) they had never seen an actual reptile.\n\nJones then argues against the common hypothesis that dragon myths might be motivated by primitive discoveries of dinosaur fossils (he argues that there are widespread traits of dragons in folklore which are not observable from fossils), and claims that the common traits of dragons seem to be an amalgam of the principal predators of our ancestral hominids, which he names as the raptors, great cats (especially leopards) and pythons.\n\nThe hypothesis to which Jones conforms is that over millions of years of evolution, members of a species will evolve an instinctive fear of their predators, and he proposes ways in which these fearful images may be merged in artistic or cultural expression to create the dragon image and, perhaps, other kinds of hybrid monster.\n\nFinally he suggests sociological reasons for why such images may be perceived differently at different stages of a culture to try to explain why Chinese dragons are considered basically good and representative of government, but the great majority (although not all) European dragons are evil and often represent chaos.\n\nJones' theory was opposed in an article by Paul Jordan-Smith in the Spring 2002 issue of \"Western Folklore\" and by other authors. Jordan-Smith criticized the lack of evidence given to prove why dragon myths could not have been passed from culture to culture. He also notes that it cannot be demonstrated that the fears of ancestral hominids are coded into the human brain. He concludes his review by writing \"One is tempted to say, as Dorothy Parker once did, that this is a book not to be tossed aside lightly but thrown violently. But no, it is not worth spending even that much energy on.\"\n\nD. Ogden writes that Jones' ideas \"might offer pause for thought given the universality of dragon-slaying narratives\". He adds, though, that the compound cat, snake, raptor creature imagined by Jones is mostly the Western stereotype based on mediaeval imagery, and that Jones has sought out similar images in a way that lacks rigor. In particular, Ogden notes that the dragons of Graeco-Roman myth do not fit with Jones's prototype, typically lacking one or more of the hybrid components (with the exception of Typhon, who, however, combines many more animals than Jones's three).\n"}

This mill was erected near a stream called Hockholme Brook, which is no longer marked though is thought to converge with the Black Brook at Chapel Milton. Originally built in 1391 for Â£12 4s 1d, the mill (which adjoined what is now Milton House) was demolished in 1946.\n\nThe other major feature is Chinley Chapel. The Christian congregation, which has continuously occupied this site almost since its foundation (in a barn at nearby Malcoff), was founded in 1662 at the time of the post-Cromwellian struggle between a Presbyterian or Episcopalian form for the Church of England. The present 'chapel', of considerable simplicity and beauty, was built, against considerable local opposition, in 1711. It flourishes as a centre of Christian (Congregational) worship. It is part of the Congregational Federation, and the current minister is Rev. Edmonde Openshaw.\n\nJohn Wesley preached in the hamlet on 28 May 1745, when the miller purportedly tried to drown him out with the sound of the watermill.

The game is often played where marshmallows are readily available, such as around a campfire. Variations include similar-sounding phrases such as Pudgy Bunny, Fluffy Bunny, Fuzzy Bunny, and Chubby Monkey.\n\nAlthough the origins of the game are unknown, a 1959 \"Peanuts\" comic strip shows Snoopy's mouth being filled with an increasing number of marshmallows while Charlie Brown keeps count.\n\nIn the game, each participant usually places a marshmallow into their mouth and says 'chubby bunny'. If they are able to state the whole phrase, usually in a comprehensible manner that the other participants wholly concur to, they pass that round. Each successful player then adds an additional marshmallow to the ones already in his or her mouth and repeats the phrase. A player who fails to complete the phrase is eliminated from the game. The process continues until only one player remains. After the penultimate player loses the game, the winning player might have to place one more marshmallow into his or her mouth and may have to state the phrase once more. The winner of the game is the player who fits the most marshmallows into his or her mouth. Some variants of the game require the winner to actually ingest the marshmallows.\n\nAt least two people have died of suffocation from choking on marshmallows.\n\nOn June 4, 1999, 12-year-old Catherine \"Casey\" Fish died after choking on four marshmallows while playing Chubby Bunny. The contest was scheduled for the annual Care Fair held at Hoffman Elementary School in Chicago's North Shore area. It was to be supervised, but Casey and some of her friends began playing while the teacher was momentarily away. She collapsed, and was taken to Glenbrook Hospital, where she died a few hours later. Fish's parents subsequently sued the school district, with the case eventually being settled out of court. They also appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" to warn about the dangers of Chubby Bunny.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, Janet Rudd, 32, from London, Ontario, Canada died in a Chubby Bunny competition at the Western Fair. St John Ambulance volunteers initially came to Rudd's aid prior to the arrival of Paramedics from Thames EMS.

Its proposals require papal approval to take effect, but are usually followed. The Congregation schedules the visits at five-year intervals (\"ad limina\") that bishops are required to make to Rome, when they meet with the pope and various departments of the Curia. It also manages the formation of new dioceses. It is one of the more influential Congregations, since it strongly influences the human resources policy of the church.\n\nThe Congregation for Bishops does not have jurisdiction over mission territories and areas managed by the Congregation for the Oriental Churches which has responsibility for Eastern Catholics everywhere and also for Latin Catholics in the Middle East and Greece. Where appointment of bishops and changes in diocesan boundaries require consultation with civil governments, the Secretariat of State has primary responsibility, but must consult the Congregation for Bishops.\n\nThe Congregation for Bishops has its origins in the \"Congregation for the Erection of Churches and Consistorial Provisions\" founded by Pope Sixtus V on 22 January 1588. Before the Second Vatican Council, when the pope announced the names of new cardinals at a Secret Consistory, that is, a consistory that only churchmen attended, the names of new cardinals would be read out, followed by those of archbishops and bishops. The name was changed from the Sacred Consistorial Congregation to the Congregation for Bishops in 1967. Since 30 June 2010 its Prefect has been Cardinal Marc Ouellet. Since 12 October 2013 its Secretary has been Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari. Since 25 January 2012 its Undersecretary has been Monsignor Udo Breitbach.\n\nThe Congregation's members who live in Rome meet every other Thursday for an entire morning. Appointments for four dioceses are reviewed in a typical session. Before the meeting, congregation members are sent documentation on the candidates for each diocese. At the meeting, one member takes the role of the presenter (\"ponente\"), reviews the information and makes his own recommendation from the list (\"terna\") of three candidates. Each member, in order of seniority, offers his assessment. The Congregation's recommendations, including any doubts, questions or minority opinions, are sent to the pope. He usually approves the congregationâs decision, but may choose to send it back for further discussion and evaluation. The prefect then meets with the pope every Saturday and presents the recommendations of the congregation. A few days later, the pope informs the congregation of his decision. The congregation then notifies the nuncio, who in turn contacts the candidate and asks if he will accept the appointment.\n\n\nIn 1965, the head of the congregation took the title prefect, while the prefect's deputy took that of secretary.\n\n\nThe secretary of the Congregation for Bishops is concurrently the secretary of the College of Cardinals. During a Papal election the secretary of the Congregation acts as the secretary to the Conclave.\n\n\nOn 16 December 2013, Pope Francis modified the Congregation's membership. He confirmed 18 of the Congregation's 33 members to continue and appointed 12 new members: \nâ¢ Cardinal Blase Cupich, Archbishop of Chicago\n\n"}

The family later moved to Middlesex, when Waller was a child, where Waller gained entrance to Westminster School. While attending Westminster School, he met fellow student Peter Asher, also the son of a doctor, and they began playing together as a duo â Peter and Gordon. Asher mentioned in a 2006 interview that \"Our voices are quite different, Gordon's and mine, but we tried singing together experimentally and we found that we could achieve this very nice harmony.\"\n\nAsher is the older brother of actress and businesswoman Jane Asher, who in the mid-1960s was girlfriend of The Beatles' Paul McCartney. Through this connection he and Waller were often given unrecorded LennonâMcCartney songs to perform, most notably their first and biggest hit, \"A World Without Love\" (1964).\n\nPeter and Gordon disbanded in 1968. Afterward, Waller attempted a solo career with little success, releasing one record, \"...and Gordon\". On this album Waller used a New York-based group White Cloud, featuring Teddy Wender on keyboards. He also appeared in a production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" as Pharaoh in 1971, a performance that he reprised on the LP. Waller first performed \"Joseph\" at the Edinburgh Festival, later reprising the role at the Albery Theatre in London's West End. In the mid-1970s Waller worked as a photocopier salesman with Rank Xerox in Leicester whilst living in Everdon, Northamptonshire. In 1995, he moved to Los Angeles, California, and started a publishing company, Steel Wallet International. Ltd., with his longtime friend and girlfriend, Georgiana Steele. After his divorce from Gay Robbins was final, he and Georgiana married on 15 August 1998, although they divorced in 2007.\n\nWaller returned to recording in 2002 as part of the \"He's a Rebel: The Gene Pitney Story Retold\" project produced by Gary Pig Gold. In 2007, Waller released a solo album \"Plays the Beatles\", featuring a new recording of \"Woman\", which Paul McCartney wrote under the pseudonym of Bernard Webb, and which had been a Peter and Gordon hit in the mid-1960s. In 2008, he followed up with the release of \"Rebel Rider\". On 19 July 2008, Peter and Gordon performed together at The Cannery Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Also on the bill that night were Chad & Jeremy. Both duos sang the final concert song (\"Bye Bye Love\") together for only the second time. On 21 August 2008, they performed a free concert on the pier in Santa Monica, California, briefly accompanied by Joan Baez. On 2 February 2009 Gordon performed with Asher at the Surf Ballroom as part of a tribute concert marking the 50th anniversary of \"The Day The Music Died.\n\nWaller married three times. The first two ended in divorce. His first wife was Gay Robbins; his second marriage was to Georgiana Steele. His third marriage, to Josenia (Jen) Couldrey, lasted from March 2008 until his death. He is survived by his two grown daughters, Phillippa and Natalie, both by first wife Gay, and a granddaughter, Tyla, as well as both his sisters, Diana and Annie.\n\nWaller resided in the village of Fowey, in Cornwall, for eight years, when his daughters were young. At the time of his death, his first wife continued to reside in Fowey and his daughters remained associated with the village. In later life, Waller lived in Ledyard, Connecticut. He went into cardiac arrest on the evening of 16 July 2009, and died aged 64 of a heart attack early in the morning of 17 July 2009 at Backus Hospital in Norwich, Connecticut.\n\nOn 29 May 2010 a sold-out tribute performance for Gordon Waller was held at the Cannery Casino and Hotel, which was Waller's favourite Las Vegas venue. Performers included Peter Asher, Chad and Jeremy, Denny Laine, Terry Sylvester of The Hollies, Ian Whitcomb, John Walker of the Walker Brothers and DJ Fontana, Elvis Presley's drummer.\n\n\n\n"}

It occurs along the Pacific coast from southeastern Alaska to southern California, and also inland east to southeastern British Columbia, northern Idaho and western Montana, with disjunctive populations in northern British Columbia, Canada; the Black Hills in South Dakota, United States; and Guadalupe Island off of Baja California, Mexico. Western swordfern is known to have locally naturalized in parts of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe dark green fronds of this fern grow tall, in a tight clump spreading out radially from a round base. They are single-pinnate, with the pinnae alternating on the stalk. Each pinna is long, with a small upward-pointing lobe (a sword hilt, hence the name) at the base, and the edges are serrated with bristly tips. Individual fronds live for 1.5 to 2.5 years and remain attached to the rhizome after withering. The round sori occupy two rows on either side of the midrib of each pinna and are covered by a centrally-attached, umbrella-like indusium with fringed edges. They produce light yellow spores.\n\nThe preferred habitat of this fern is the understory of moist coniferous woodlands at low elevations. It grows best in well-drained acidic soil of rich humus and small stones. It is very resilient and survives occasional droughts, but flourishes only with consistent moisture and light sunlight, and it prefers cool weather.\n\nIn cultivation, it also responds well to regular, light fertilizations. While this fern is a favored horticultural subject in western North America, it has proved difficult or impossible to cultivate satisfactorily in the eastern part of the continent.\n\nIn the United Kingdom \"Polystichum munitum\" has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nThe Coast Salish people of B.C. and Washington state use this plant as a pain reliever. When applied directly to the area where pain and inflammation occur, according to Della Rice Sylvester, an elder and medicine woman of the Cowichan tribe, the sword fern \"takes the pain away!\". This traditional use has spread among the hiking communities and youth scouting organizations of the region, where it is a common piece of hiker's lore that a rash from a stinging nettle can be counteracted by rubbing the spores on the underside of sword fern on the area.\n\nIn spring, when other food is unavailable, Quileute, Makah, Klallam, Squamish, Sechelt, Haida, and other Native American/First Nations peoples roasted, peeled, and ate the rhizomes. The plant is also cultivated for its ornamental foliage, which florists include in vases.\n\n"}

The most prominent features of the park are Locust Mountain and Tuscarora Lake. The park is named for the Tuscarora Indians, who lived in the area, following the Tuscarora War in North Carolina, until they were forced out by the colonial settlers of Pennsylvania. Tuscarora State Park is west of Tamaqua just off of Pennsylvania Route 309.\n\nTuscarora State Park is located in Locust Valley. This land was covered by an old-growth forest of eastern white pine, American chestnut, eastern hemlock, ash, hickory, elm, oak and cherry trees. The land was controlled at various times by the Susquehannock, Lenape and at the time of the arrival of colonial settlers, the Iroquois League of Five Nations.\n\nAnthracite coal was discovered in Schuylkill County. The forests of the Locust Valley were harvested to provide lumber for supports in the coal mines and the various buildings and homes erected by the coal mining companies. Hemlock was used to produce leather goods in the tanneries that were built in the area. The massive destruction of the forests left the Locust Valley an area of shrubby land that was susceptible to flooding, erosion and wild fires. Some of the land was cleared and farmed.\n\nThe area in and around Tuscarora and Locust Lake State Parks was purchased by the Marchalonis family. They constructed Locust Lake and allowed the forests and the area to grow back. They sold their land to the state of Pennsylvania in 1966 and the parks were opened soon afterwards.\n\nThe park has seven hiking trails that wander through deciduous forests, meadows and fields. The trails are all reclaimed logging roads, making them quite wide, and are not marked with identifying blazes.\n\n\nTuscarora Lake is a warm water fishery containing bass, muskellunge, walleye, pickerel, catfish, yellow perch, trout and sunfish. Night fishing and ice fishing are permitted. The rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission apply. All boats must be either row boats or powerboats with electric motors. They must have a launch permit from the fish commission or valid registration from any state. Rowboats, canoes and pedal boats are available to rent.\n\nThe lake is open for swimming beginning on Memorial Day weekend and ending Labor Day weekend. Beginning in 2008 lifeguards will not be posted at the beach. The maximum depth of the lake in the swimming area is 5.5Â feet (1.67Â m).\n\nHunting is permitted on about of Tuscarora State Park. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The primary game species are squirrels, white-tailed deer, rabbits, pheasant, woodcocks, doves, turkey, and ruffed grouse.\n\nTuscarora has an overnight area with camping cottages and yurts.\n\nThe following state parks are within of Tuscarora State Park:\n"}
