While playing in Spain, he was voted 2007–08 Deportivo La Coruña Player of the Year.\n\nDe Guzman has played at both the Canadian U-20 and Senior level, he was awarded the Canadian Player of the Year in 2008 and in 2007 became only the second Canadian international to be awarded the CONCACAF Gold Cup Most Valuable Player. He is currently the all-time cap leader of the Canadian national team, a record he has held since November 2015 when he surpassed Paul Stalteri's previous record of 84 appearances. From 2013 to 2016, he was captain of the Canadian men's national team.\n\nMost recently De Guzman was the general manager of the Ottawa Fury FC from 2017 until they dissolved at the end of 2019.\n\nDe Guzman was discovered by representatives of Olympique Marseille while playing for the North Scarborough youth soccer club in Toronto. After playing with Marseille's reserve side, de Guzman became a first-team with 1. FC Saarbrücken in the German 2. Bundesliga in the 2000–01 season, where he made two appearances, and in the 2001–02 season, where he made 19 appearances. In 21 appearances he never scored.\n\nIn 2002, he joined newly promoted Hannover 96, becoming only the third Canadian to play in the German First Bundesliga. He made 20 appearances during 2002–03 season and 32 appearances in both 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons.\nDe Guzman's contract with Hannover expired in 2005 allowing him to move to any team with no transfer fee. He was heavily linked with a move to Tottenham where he would have joined Canadian captain Paul Stalteri. He decided against the move to London due to the depth in the centre of mid-field, and instead chose to join Deportivo La Coruña in Spain becoming the first Canadian to play in La Liga. After playing a starring role in the club's remarkable turnaround in the 2007–2008 season to avoid relegation and gain a spot in the UEFA Cup, de Guzman was named the team's player of the season. In 95 appearances he scored one goal. His only goal with Deportivo came in 2005 against the Spanish giants Real Madrid. His contract with Deportivo expired in the summer of 2009.\n\nIn September 2009 an agreement was reached with Toronto FC for de Guzman to sign as a designated player, becoming the first ever Canadian Designated Player in league history. His contract was worth $1,910,746 annually. The Canadian midfielder signed a three-year deal to play in MLS. De Guzman made his debut for the club in an away game against the Los Angeles Galaxy on September 19, 2009. He finished the 2009 season with five appearances. De Guzman was able to convince former Deportivo teammate and friend Mista to join Toronto in July 2010. De Guzman was heavily criticized for his inconsistent performances as a designated player in the 2010 season making 36 appearances in all competitions. Much doubt was left over the future of de Guzman and Toronto on November 23 when the club failed to protect him for the 2010 MLS Expansion Draft, meaning Vancouver Whitecaps FC or Portland Timbers could select him if they were willing to take on a Designated Players Salary. However, he was untouched going through the sixth round when Vancouver selected O'Brian White which allowed Toronto to protect one player for the remaining four rounds in which they protected de Guzman . On January 5, 2011, de Guzman revealed that he would be undergoing knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus which might have plagued his performance for the last quarter of the season.\n\nIn January 2011, Toronto hired Aron Winter as the head coach of the club to bring in a new style of possession soccer, many pundits believed that this new style would benefit de Guzman's abilities and allow him to succeed within the MLS. Ten days before the new season kicked off it was revealed that de Guzman would miss this first game against Vancouver and potentially a few more, due to Winter not wanting to aggravate the recent successful surgery. De Guzman scored his first goal for Toronto in CONCACAF Champions League play against Tauro FC August 18, 2011, the game ended in a 2–0 away victory.\n\nOn July 13, 2012, de Guzman was traded to FC Dallas in exchange for forward Andrew Wiedeman. De Guzman made his debut for Dallas against San Jose Earthquakes on July 18, the game ended in a 2–1 away defeat. De Guzman scored his only goal for Dallas on September 15 against Vancouver, a left footed volley more than 20 yards out six minutes into second half stoppage time.\n\nDe Guzman remained with FC Dallas through the 2012 season. His contract expired after 2012 and the club made him available for the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft in December 2012. de Guzman became a free agent after he went undrafted in both rounds of the draft.\n\nOn the last day of the 2012–13 winter transfer window, de Guzman joined SSV Jahn Regensburg. He made his debut for the team on February 3, playing all 90 minutes in a 1–5 loss against Hertha BSC. At the end of the season Jahn Regensburg was relegated from 2. Bundesliga, when De Guzman signed in January he had a clause that if they were relegated he would automatically become a free agent. He had made 15 appearances for the club.\n\nFollowing the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup in late July, de Guzman signed for Skoda Xanthi in the Superleague Greece. His debut came in a third round UEFA Europa League match against Standard Liège on August 1. He scored in the second leg of the series on August 8, but Skoda Xanthi would lose 4–2 on aggregate. He made his league debut for the club on August 17 in a 3–0 loss to P.A.O.K.. After his contract expired, he looked for a club in or near Germany to be closer to his family, but he has not found anything as of yet.\n\nAfter several months without a club he was rumoured to be signing with Columbus Crew following a training spell with the MLS club, however a week later de Guzman signed with Ottawa Fury of the North American Soccer League on March 27, 2015. He made his debut on April 4 against the Carolina RailHawks.\n\nOn December 16, 2015, de Guzman re-signed with Ottawa for the 2016 season. He was subsequently named captain of the club on March 9, 2016.\n\nDe Guzman played at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship in Argentina, alongside Atiba Hutchinson and Mike Klukowski among others.\n\nHe made his senior debut for Canada in a January 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup match against Martinique. By July 2015, he earned a total of 82 caps, scoring 4 goals. He has represented Canada in 22 FIFA World Cup qualification matches.\n\nIn Canada's opening match of the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup, de Guzman scored twice to help defeat Costa Rica 2–1. After the conclusion of the competition, de Guzman was named tournament MVP.\n\nDe Guzman was also chosen in the 23-man roster for the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup, Canada won group A with seven points before being knocked out by Honduras in the quarter finals. He was later chosen in the all-tournament team along with fellow Canadian Michael Klukowski, this was the second time in a row he has been selected for this competition.\n\nOn June 1, 2011, in a friendly against Ecuador in the last minutes of play Canada was down 2–1 when de Guzman played a clever yet controversial quick free kick just outside the 18 yard box to Tosaint Ricketts who put in the net for his first ever international goal leading the Canadian team to a well earned draw. De Guzman earned his fiftieth cap for Canada's senior men's team on October 7, 2011, in a dominating 7–0 victory over Saint Lucia in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match at Beausejour Stadium.\n\nOn November 17, 2015, de Guzman started for Canada against El Salvador in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match and overtook Paul Stalteri as Canada's most capped player in history earning his 85th cap.\n\nOn January 30, 2017, de Guzman announced his retirement from soccer and his transition to an assistant coaching position with the Ottawa Fury. On August 15, 2017, de Guzman was named interim head coach until the end of the 2017 season after the resignation of head coach Paul Dalglish.\n\nOn December 21, 2017, de Guzman was appointed general manager of the Ottawa Fury, alongside new head coach Nikola Popovic.\n\nBefore his career, he attended Cardinal Newman Catholic High School from 1994 to 1997. His younger brother Jonathan de Guzmán also plays professional soccer formerly at Villarreal CF, Napoli, and Swansea FC but now at Eintracht Frankfurt and plays internationally for the Netherlands.\n\n\n"}

Researchers believe that the kingdom was centred at Beruas and it collapsed after an attack by King Rajendra Chola I of Coromandel, South India, between 1025 and 1026. Another Malay annals Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa known as Kedah Annals, Gangga Negara may have been founded by Merong Mahawangsa's son Raja Ganji Sarjuna of Kedah, allegedly a descendant of Alexander the Great or by the Khmer royalties no later than the 2nd century.\n\nGangga Negara means \"a city on the Ganges\" in Sanskrit, the name derived from Ganganagar in northwest India where the Kambuja peoples inhabited. The Kambujas are an Indo-Iranian clan of the Indo-European family, originally localised in Pamirs and Badakshan. Commonly known as Hindu traders, they built their colonies in Southeast Asia around 2,000 years ago at the Mekong valley and also at the Malay archipelago in Funan, Chenla, Champa, Khmer, Angkor, Langkasuka, Sailendra, Srivijaya, etc. Historians found the Kambuja traders travelled from Gujarat to Sri Lanka and then to Ligor (Nakhon Sri Thammarat) of the northern Malay peninsular, overland to Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nThe first research into the Beruas kingdom was conducted by Colonel James Low in 1849 and a century later, by H.G. Quaritch Wales. According to the Museum and Antiquities Department, both researchers agreed that the Gangga Negara kingdom existed between 100 - 1000 CE but could not ascertain the exact site. For years, villagers had unearthed artefacts believed to be from the ancient kingdoms, most of which are at present displayed at the Beruas Museum. Artefacts on display include a 128 kg cannon, swords, kris, coins, tin ingots, pottery from the Ming Dynasty and various eras, and large jars. They can be dated back to the 5th and 6th century. Through these artefacts, it has been postulated that Pengkalan (Ipoh), Kinta Valley, Tanjung Rambutan, Bidor and Sungai Siput were part of the kingdom. Artifacts also suggest that the kingdom's centre might have shifted several times. Gangga Negara was renamed to Beruas after the establishment of Islam there.\n\nThe district of Beruas has found some royal Acehnese gravestones and this evidence has it linked to another historical source that a Samudera Pasai prince from Aceh of Sumatra rested at Beruas tree (Pokok Beruas), his name was Malik. History of Pasai did mentioned a Malik ul Salih who was the first local Hindu Malay king to convert to Islam in 1267. Today the Beruas trees (Garcinia hombroniana) can still be found in the nearby villages of Pengkalan Baru and Batang Kubu.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838673", "title": "William Mason (Colt)", "text": "William Mason (Colt)\n\nWilliam Mason (January 30, 1837 – July 17, 1913) was a patternmaker, engineer and inventor who worked for Remington Arms, Colt’s Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company, and Winchester Repeating Arms Company in the 19th century.\n\nMason began his career as an apprentice patternmaker, eventually working in the arms industry for Remington Arms. While at Remington, on November 21 1865, he received U.S. patent 51,117, for a swing-out cylinder for easy loading and the star ejector mechanism to eject spent cartridge cases, a design used in 1896 by S&W for the .38 Hand Ejector (M&P and S&W Model 10).\n\nMason left Remington Arms in 1866 to work for Colt as the Superintendent of the armory. Along with Charles Richards, Mason patented designs to convert percussion revolvers into rear-loading metallic cartridge revolvers. Those converted revolvers are identified as the \"Richards-Mason conversion\". After working on these conversions, Mason began work on Colt's first metallic cartridge revolvers in 1871: the Colt Model 1871-72 “Open Top” revolver was the third such pistol, following the .41 caliber House Pistol and the .22 caliber seven-shot Open Top. The Open Top .44 was a completely new design and the parts would not interchange with the older percussion pistols. Mason moved the rear sight to the rear of the barrel as opposed to the hammer or the breechblock of the earlier efforts. The caliber was .44 Henry and it was submitted to the US Army for testing in 1872. The Army rejected the pistol and asked for a more powerful caliber with a stronger frame. Mason redesigned the frame to incorporate a top strap, similar to the Remington revolvers and placed the rear sight on the rear of the frame. The first prototype was chambered in .44 rimfire, but the first model was in the newest caliber known as the .45 Colt.\nThe revolver was chosen by the Army in 1872, with the first order shipping in the summer of 1873 for 8,000 revolvers. After the success of the Colt Single Action Army and Colt's conversion of existing percussion revolvers to Richards-Mason conversions, Mason went on to design Colt's smallest revolver, \"The New Line\" in 1874. There were 5 variants, each differing in size and caliber, but all using a breechblock designed by Mason.\n\nWhile Colt had first developed the concept of a \"double-action\" revolver as early as 1857 and a patent was filed, it was never built by Colt. With increased competition from their British rival, Webley & Scott, Colt had Mason design a double-action revolver for them in 1877, the Colt M1877. Following this, Mason once again teamed up with Richards to produce a larger framed version, the Colt M1878 Frontier in 1878.\n\nHis final design for Colt was the Colt M1889, a collaboration with Carl J. Ehbets for a revolver with a swing-out cylinder. Ehbets continued to perfect the idea for 7 years after Mason left Colt for Winchester.\n\nMason left Colt to work for the Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1882. While he was originally hired to design a revolver to compete with Colt's revolvers, Mason eventually made working prototypes of many of John Moses Browning's designs. One of his more notable design improvements was the Winchester Model 1886 rifle. In 1885 he became the Master Mechanic at Winchester and held that position until his death in Worcester, Massachusetts on July 17, 1913.\n\nMason was an inaugural member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and over the course of his life he patented 125 inventions for firearms, ammunition, firearm manufacturing machinery, steam pumps and power looms. Winchester historian Mary Jo Ignoffo called Mason, \"one of the most significant designers of the nineteenth century\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1838677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838677", "title": "Massimo Pigliucci", "text": "Massimo Pigliucci\n\nMassimo Pigliucci (; born January 16, 1964) is Professor of Philosophy at CUNY-City College, formerly co-host of the \"Rationally Speaking Podcast\", and formerly the editor in chief for the online magazine \"Scientia Salon\". He is an outspoken critic of pseudoscience and creationism, and an advocate for secularism and science education.\n\nPigliucci was born in Monrovia, Liberia and raised in Rome, Italy. He has a doctorate in genetics from the University of Ferrara, Italy, a PhD in biology from the University of Connecticut, and a PhD in philosophy of science from the University of Tennessee. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n\nPigliucci was formerly a professor of ecology and evolution at Stony Brook University. He explored phenotypic plasticity, genotype-environment interactions, natural selection, and the constraints imposed on natural selection by the genetic and developmental makeup of organisms. In 1997, while working at the University of Tennessee, Pigliucci received the Theodosius Dobzhansky Prize, awarded annually by the Society for the Study of Evolution to recognize the accomplishments and future promise of an outstanding young evolutionary biologist. As a philosopher, Pigliucci is interested in the structure and foundations of evolutionary theory, the relationship between science and philosophy, and the relationship between science and religion. He is a proponent of an extended evolutionary synthesis to unify parts of biology not covered by the \"modern synthesis\" of the 20th century.\n\nPigliucci writes regularly for \"Skeptical Inquirer\" on topics such as climate change denial, intelligent design, pseudoscience, and philosophy. He has also written for \"Philosophy Now\" and maintains a blog called \"Rationally Speaking\". He has debated \"deniers of evolution\" (young-earth creationists and intelligent design proponents), including young earth creationists Duane Gish and Kent Hovind and intelligent design proponents William Dembski and Jonathan Wells, on many occasions. \n\nPigliucci is an atheist, but does not believe that science necessarily demands atheism, because of two distinctions: that between methodological naturalism and philosophical naturalism, and that between value judgements and matters of fact. He believes that many scientists and science educators fail to appreciate these differences. Pigliucci has criticized New Atheist writers for embracing what he considers to be scientism (although he largely excludes philosopher Daniel Dennett from this charge). In a discussion of his book \"Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to a More Meaningful Life\", Pigliucci told Skepticality podcast host Derek Colanduno, \"Aristotle was the first ancient thinker to really take seriously the idea that you need both empirical facts, you need an evidence-based approach to the world and you need to be able to reflect on the meaning of those facts... If you want answers to moral questions then you don't ask the neurobiologist, you don't ask the evolutionary biologist, you ask the philosopher.\"\n\nPigliucci describes the mission of skeptics, referencing Carl Sagan's \"The Demon-Haunted World\" saying \"What skeptics are about is to keep that candle lit and spread it as much as possible\". Pigliucci serves on the board of NYC Skeptics and on the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America.\n\nIn 2001, he debated William Lane Craig over the existence of God.\n\nMassimo Pigliucci criticized the newspaper article by Pope Francis entitled, \"An open dialogue with non-believers\". Pigliucci viewed the article as a monologue rather than a dialogue and, in a response personally addressed to Pope Francis, wrote that the Pope only offered non-believers \"a reaffirmation of entirely unsubstantiated fantasies about God and his Son...followed by a confusion between the concept of love and truth, the whole peppered by a significant amount of historical revisionism and downright denial of the ugliest facets of your Church.\"\n\nPigliucci became a popularizer of Stoicism and one of the driving forces in Stoicism's resurgence in the United States in the early twenty first century. His 2015 essay for the New York Times on the topic was one of the most shared articles to date. Pigliucci said he always felt Stoicism was part of his Italian heritage, but he came to practice it after being disenchanted with Buddhism. Though he finds both schools of thought to share similarities. \n\nPigliucci has criticized David Chalmers' Hard Problem of Consciousness, and he similarly is a critic of panpsychism. While he is a realist about consciousness, he thinks that claiming there is a distinction between the so called hard and easy problems of consciousness is a category error. \n\nIn August 2000 Massimo started with a monthly internet column called Rationally Speaking. In August 2005, the column became a blog, where he wrote posts until March 2014. Starting in February 2010, he co-hosted the bi-weekly \"Rationally Speaking\" podcast with Julia Galef, whom he first met at the Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism, held in September 2009. The podcast is produced by the New York City Skeptics. The show has had many guests -- scientists, philosophers -- discussing matters of reason, skepticism and rationality. In 2010, Neil DeGrasse Tyson explained on the show his justification for spending large amounts of government money on space programs. He eventually printed the transcript of his performance as a guest on the show in his book \"Space Chronicles\" as a full chapter covering eight pages. Another episode in which Tyson explained his position on the label \"atheism\" received attention on NPR. Pigliucci left the podcast in 2015 to pursue his other interests. Galef continued to host the podcast solo. \n\n\nThe following are a select few of Pigliucci's articles. Some may be found at the Internet Infidels' Secular Web.\n\n"}

It is located approximately from the Brisbane CBD. It was named after the early Australian explorer John Oxley. The suburb supports a mix of residential, retail and industrial land.\n\nOxley is bounded to the north by the Brisbane River and Oxley Creek flows along the eastern edge. In the east the environment is shaped by flood plains which experience major flooding and flash-flooding. Western parts of the suburb are characterised by rolling hills with clay-laden soils.\n\nThe suburb is traversed by the Ipswich Motorway connecting Oxley to Rocklea to the east and Darra to the west. Oxley Road connects Oxley to Corinda to the north and continues south across the Ipswich Motorway with the name Blunder Road to Durack, Seventeen Mile Rocks Road connects Oxley to the west to Seventeen Mile Rocks and Darra. Oxley is separated from Fig Tree Pocket by the Brisbane River. Oxley resides in the same postal code area as Corinda, Sherwood and Graceville.\nOxley has two golf courses and a golf driving range—Oxley Golf Course located on Boundary Road, and Corinda Golf Course located on Cliveden Avenue, the latter of which has now been purchased by Brisbane Boys' College as their playing fields along with the driving range. Oxley also contains a lawn bowls club, the Canossa Private Hospital, the Queensland Police Service's training academy, two highway motels, a war memorial, post office, mosque and a few churches.\n\nStores include an Aldi supermarket, a smaller Foodworks grocery store and a McDonald's restaurant. Retailers with outlets in Oxley include Harvey Norman, Bunnings Warehouse, Officeworks, Super A-mart, The Good Guys and there is a 1st Choice liquor store. The suburb has two petrol service stations and a few landscaping material suppliers in the western parts. With an easily accessed supply of clay in the area PGH Bricks & Pavers has one of two Queensland production plants located here. On 17 July 2013, a new Woolworths store opened on Oxley Station Road. The Station Oxley Shopping Centre is located at 133 Station Road also contains approximately 15 speciality retail stores and the Department of Disability Services Queensland on the upper level.\n\nThe former Austral Bricks quarry site in Douglas Street, as well as two other plots of vacant land in the area have been converted to residential estates, providing significant housing to a region and growing city, where strong demand is not being met by supply. The quarry was originally owned by Brittain Bricks. For many years the site was a brickworks, sourcing clay directly from adjacent pits. After production stopped, the kiln stack remained intact. During the mid-1990s the tall structure was removed as it was attracting lightning strikes.\n\nThe first land sale that covered parts of today's Oxley occurred in 1851. Oxley once covered a larger area including the suburbs of Chelmer, Graceville and Corinda to the north. It extended to the south into the current suburbs of Willawong and Durack. The first subdivision of residential lands occurred in 1864 near Douglas Street. Although the railway through the suburb connected Oxley to the rest of Brisbane it was the road to Ipswich that defined the suburb's early development.\n\nThe suburb was a stop-over point on the Cobb & Co coach route west to the Darling Downs. The first hotel in Oxley was built in 1860 close to Oxley Creek on a rise near Factory Road. It attracted other businesses to the area and provided refreshments for travellers between Brisbane and Ipswich. The hotel soon gained a reputation as a venue where drinking and dancing occurred well into the morning hours. The hotel was moved several times due to flooding which was not a deterrent to the licensee. By 1892 a brick hotel has been built on the corner of Oxley Road and Ipswich Road, the site of a public bar still open today.\n\nIn 1870 the first school in Oxley was opened. A small creamery was operating in 1873, most probably located near Factory Road in Oxley's south east parts. The railway station was opened in 1874. This led to the establishment of a second subdivision in 1876, referred to as the Township of Oxley which was centred on the train station. It consisted of 140 allotments with the lower ones experiencing periodic inundation. In the same year the construction of the first police station was completed. Dairying became common in the area during the 1890s. The 1893 Brisbane flood halted housing construction in the lower parts of Oxley for many years. William Brittain moved his brick making operations to a site on Douglas Street in 1899.\n\nIn 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the suburb of Oxley. In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.\n\nBy 1904 the \"Bacon Factory\" as it was locally known as, which produced not only bacon but also cheese, ham and other small goods was established. Because of regular flooding the Oxley police station was moved in 1911, to a site where the police academy currently is. The Oxley Progress Association was founded in 1917. It built the small hall in Station Road and supported the establishment of the Oxley War Memorial. This community group was still active in the early 1990s. During this time the Darra cement works on the western edge of Oxley had plans for a major expansion. With the help of the Oxley Progress Association residents were successful in stopping this development. In the 1960s the group played a major role in the proclamation of Queensland's \"Clean Air Act\".\n\nThe Oxley war memorial to the fallen was opened in 1920. The Oxley Golf Club was established in 1928. A Methodist church was built in 1930 and a Presbyterian church in 1961. The Oxley Scout Group was formed in 1951 and in 1955 the Oxley fire station was established. An ambulance station was built in the suburb in 1961 but was moved to Durack in 2002. Oxley High School was opened in 1966 and then closed in 2000. The bus/rail interchange at Oxley station was built in 1977.\n\nIn 2003, Oxley was one of a number of suburbs that benefited from the Suburban Community Improvement Programme. Landscaping and tree planting around Oxley Station and the beautification of the nearby roundabout and footpaths were some of the activities undertaken by the Brisbane City Council to improve the area's appearance. A second tavern on Blunder Road was opened in 2003.\n\nThe 2010–2011 Queensland floods inundated many properties along the main roads of Oxley Road, Blunder Road and the Ipswich Motorway as well as at least ten minor roads.\n\nOxley has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\n\nThe Ipswich Motorway traverses Oxley and the train from Brisbane to Ipswich has a station at Oxley, and is connected to a number of suburbs via bus services. A CityExpress bus stop on Blunder Road links Inala Plaza bus station to the inner city using Ipswich Road.

He served his apprenticeship at Robbins & Lawrence in Windsor, Vermont. Robbins & Lawrence was a factory and armory that was an important early node in the social network of the 19th century machine tool industry.\n\nIn 1856, at the age of 21, he worked at the Colt armory in Hartford, Connecticut as a die sinker and tool maker and became their expert on the drop forging process. In 1862, he went to E. Remington & Sons, where he built up their forging plant, increasing its efficiency and saving $50,000 by one improvement in frame forging alone. At the end of the American Civil War, he returned to Hartford as the superintendent of the Weed Sewing Machine Company, which had taken over the old Sharps Rifle Works, built by Robbins & Lawrence.\n\nIn 1868, while at the Roper Repeating Arms Company in Amherst, Massachusetts, he worked with Christopher M. Spencer. The Roper company failed and in 1869, the two founded a partnership in Hartford, Connecticut called Billings & Spencer, which would manufacture sewing machines, drop-forged hand tools, and machine tools. Billings perfected a drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator which was central to the operation of electrical generators and motors.\n\nIn 1895, Billings was president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nHe died on June 5, 1920 in Hartford, Connecticut and was interred at Cedar Hill Cemetery.\n\n"}

He founded and runs Little Mountain Recordings and THIS IS Recordings. Kleinenberg is well known for his use of digital video in concerts, his \"Everybody\" and This Is brands of club nights and albums and his 2000 single \"My Lexicon\" as well as hits like \"The Fruit\" and \"This Is Miami\".\n\nSander Kleinenberg began DJing at a local bar in 1987 at the age of 15, playing a variety of music including rock and dance music. After sending demos to many European record labels, Kleinenberg released his first single \"Bombay\" in 1993 on Belgian record label Wonka Beats under the artist name \"Free Frogs\", a collaboration with several friends. The next year, he released a single on German record label Superstition. In 1996, Kleinenberg released \"YDW (You Do Me Wrong)\" under the moniker \"S 'N' S\" on the Dutch record label Deal Records and licensed by Strictly Rhythm. His early influences included Mantronix, Shep Pettibone, and Depeche Mode.\nIn 1999, Kleinenberg produced the first part of his thematic \"4 Seasons\" trilogy with second part the following in 2000, both on London's FFRR label. Kleinenberg was also becoming known worldwide with the release of his track \"My Lexicon\", which is now often considered a genre standard of progressive house. \"My Lexicon\" is well known for its catchy, trancey percussive melody and atmospheric chord stabs. \"My Lexicon\" and \"Sacred\" were both given a boost in popularity by their appearance on Sasha's \"\" album. Kleinenberg was to join the Global Underground label the following year with his \"Nubreed 004\" release.\n\nIn 2003, Sander Kleinenberg founded his record label Little Mountain Recordings. Its first release was the final part in Kleinenberg's \"4 Seasons\" series, which had been pushed back due to, among other things, label changes. Kleinenberg described the final installment as \"rougher around the edges\" rather than having the trancey serenity of the first or the funkiness of the second. He also remixed Justin Timberlake's single \"Rock Your Body\", which garnered him the Best Remix award at the Dancestar USA Awards. Later in 2003, Kleinenberg kicked off the introduction of his \"Everybody\" brand with the album \"\" which featured a mixture of quirky disco, Detroit techno, and tech house. Kleinenberg described the concept of \"Everybody\" as \"a reaction to how dance music began to take itself too seriously\" and that he hopes to show that dance music can be fun. He followed \"Everybody\" up the next year with a sequel, \"This Is Everybody Too\", which continued Kleinenberg's vein of \"glitchy, low key techno\".\n\nIn 2005, Kleinenberg began a monthly residency at Crobar, New York City, using it to push the \"Everybody\" brand. He also brought in Lee Burridge to Crobar and to work on the album \"This is Everybody! On Tour\". Kleinenberg's performances at Crobar often featured appearances from young DJs, such as Desyn Masiello. Over his career, Kleinenberg's track selection shifted from the more \"lush\" sounds of progressive house to a funkier electro house vibe, though he prefers to define his genre simply as \"house music\". In 2004 he had released his track \"The Fruit\" and in 2006 he released \"This is Miami\"; both tracks reached a number one position in the ARIA chart. His \"Everybody\" brand has grown with the years and has changed to his current \"This Is...\" brand which was influenced by his song \"This Is Miami\", another version of the song which was used in the Sensation (event) is called, \"This Is Sensation\".\n\nThe This Is club brand held residencies in clubs like Avalon in Los Angeles, Discoteque in Moscow, Paradiso and Melkweg in Amsterdam, Red Light in Paris and Pacha in Ibiza\n\nAfter years of intensive touring Sander Kleinenberg got back into the studio to deliver his debut album '5K' in 2010. The first single of this album was \"Remember When\", featuring UK singer/songwriter Jamie Cullum.\nTogether with the release of the \"5K\" album and the \"Remember When\" single, Sander launched his new music label THIS IS Recordings.\n\nIn early 2012, Kleinenberg toured Lahore, Pakistan and performed in front of a large audience.\n\nOn December 1, 2014, he released his single \"Can You Feel It\" featuring Gwen McCrae. The single has been described as \"a deep and soulful intervention in the Dutch maestro’s indie dance etiquette, held together with strong production values and an inherently intimate demeanor.\"\n\nSander Kleinenberg is well known for his DVJing with self-created visuals and video usage in concerts. Kleinenberg explains his use of video saying that it allows for more variety among DJs and performances and that it makes concerts reflect life. Due to the complexity of mixing both audio and visual at concerts, Kleinenberg will use the club's on-site VJ or have his partner Mark Pistoire of Venga Boys fame as a VJ at his concerts using the DVJ-X1 or the newer DVJ1000. Kleinenberg first met Pistoire in 2003 when searching for a VJ for his \"Everybody\" events and the two performed live together for the first time in The Hague. The in-concert imagery often includes political content or trippy home videos created by Pistoire or Kleinenberg.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It specialized in vertical boring mills and was largely responsible for the development of the modern form of that class of machine tools.\n\nThe firm was founded in 1894 by Edward Payson Bullard Sr. (born 1841-04-18 in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, USA; died 1906-12-22 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA). He received formative experience at the Colt armory and Pratt & Whitney, which were influential development centers for generations of toolmakers. Bullard Sr is believed to have developed the first small boring machine designed to do the accurate work previously performed on the faceplate of a lathe. Roe (1916) says that \"Up to that time boring machines were relied on only for large and rough work.\"\n\nBullard Sr.'s son, Edward Payson Bullard Jr. (1872–1953), continued the family machine tool business and brought the turret principle to the vertical boring mill, making it a vertical turret lathe. For a while in America during the 20th century, the name \"Bullard\" on the shop floor was something of a genericized trademark for vertical turret-head boring mills. E.P. Bullard Jr led the development of the company's multiple-spindle brand machine that became an important automatic lathe in the mass production of parts for the automotive industry. Bullard Jr was president of the company for 40 years, through World War I, the interwar period, and World War II, a period during which the Bullard company was the largest machine tool builder in the U.S., and vast volumes of military matériel were produced by countless companies running Bullard machines. Bullard is now owned by Bourn& Koch, based in Rockford, Illinois. Bourn & Koch continues to provide OEM parts, service and support for their machines.\n\n"}
{"id": "1838699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838699", "title": "Vena amoris", "text": "Vena amoris\n\nVena amoris is a Latin name meaning, literally, \"vein of love\". Traditional belief established that this vein ran directly from the fourth finger of the left hand to the heart. This theory has been cited in western cultures as one of the reasons the engagement ring and/or wedding ring was placed on the fourth finger, or \"ring finger\". This traditional belief is factually inaccurate as all the fingers in the hand have a similar vein structure.\n\nThe earliest use of jewelry to signify a bonding was often chains and bracelets. This evolved to the use of the symbolic ring. In ancient Egypt, the Sun and the Moon gods were feared and worshipped. A ring was a symbol of these spirits, both of whom were also related to the home and hearth. The endless circle showed the eternal nature of the bond, while the open centre was meant to be a doorway to things unknown.\n\nThis tradition was later assimilated by the Greeks, after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 BC. Up to this time betrothal rings were generally made out of hemp, leather, bone, or ivory. In early Rome the use of metal rings gradually began to take over from these materials, and the metal of choice back then was iron. Gold and silver rings were given on rare occasions, to prove that a man trusted his wife with his valuable property.\n\nThe earliest known occurrence of the phrase \"vena amoris\" was from Henry Swinburne, an English ecclesiastical lawyer whose work covering marriage, the puritanical \"A Treatise of Espousal or Matrimonial Contracts\", was published posthumously in 1686. He cites unidentified ancient sources and purports an Egyptian connection; but no earlier mention of the vein can be found. Macrobius, in Saturnalia VII, 13 (a notably fictional work) refers to the connection between the ring finger and the heart, but implies in the one phrase a nerve rather than a vein, and in another implies more of a magical than physical significance to the choice of finger. The hand is not specified. Of note, the circulatory system was unknown at the time. Another early reference, again not specifying the hand, was by Isidore of Seville in his 7th century work \"De ecclesiasticis officiis\" XX, 8, which refers to the Roman story of a vein connected to the heart.\n\nThe choice of finger is also less than settled until recent times; during the 17th century in England it was not unusual to wear the wedding ring on the thumb. Gauls and Britons wore their rings on the middle finger, and the choice of right or left hand appears relatively dependent on culture; though cultures that use either the right or left ring finger both claim a historical connection to the \"vena amoris\". The use of wedding and betrothal rings was not commonplace in the Roman Empire until the 2nd century; which also contradicts versions of the story which claim that this tradition was brought to Rome in the 3rd century BC.\n\nThe strong possibility exists, based on the lack of concrete sources, that this story is a combination of ancient beliefs in the mystical properties of the ring finger, smatterings of legend, and shrewd marketing by the jewellery industry, which has in the past demonstrated a willingness to exploit myths and legends to increase ring sales.\n"}
{"id": "1838700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838700", "title": "KABB", "text": "KABB\n\nKABB, virtual channel 29 (UHF digital channel 30), is a Fox-affiliated television station licensed to San Antonio, Texas, United States. The station is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, as part of a duopoly with NBC affiliate WOAI-TV (channel 4, also licensed to San Antonio); Sinclair also operates Kerrville-licensed CW affiliate KMYS (channel 35) under joint sales and shared services agreements (JSA/SSA) with owner Deerfield Media. The three stations share studios between Babcock Road and Sovereign Drive (off Loop 410) in northwest San Antonio; KABB's transmitter is located off of US 181 in northwest Wilson County (northeast of Elmendorf). The station brands itself as \"Fox San Antonio\", even though it is stylized as \"Fox 29\" through its logo.\n\nOn cable, KABB is available on Charter Spectrum and Grande Communications channel 11, and AT&T U-verse channel 29.\n\nKABB first signed on the air on December 16, 1987 as the first independent station in the San Antonio market since KRRT (channel 35, now CW affiliate KMYS)—which by that point, was the market's original Fox affiliate—debuted in November 1985. Channel 29 was originally owned by the Alamo Broadcasting Corporation, from which its call letters were taken.\n\nAlamo Broadcasting sold the station to River City Broadcasting in 1989. In 1994, Paramount Pictures, then-owners of KRRT through its Paramount Stations Group subsidiary, entered into a partnership with Chris-Craft Industries—which owned NBC affiliate KMOL-TV (channel 4, now WOAI-TV) at the time—to create the United Paramount Network (UPN), with KRRT serving as the network's San Antonio affiliate. River City subsequently signed an affiliation agreement with Fox for KABB to become the network's new area affiliate; on January 16, 1995, KRRT dropped Fox programming to become the market's original affiliate of UPN, with KABB assuming the Fox affiliation; shortly afterward, KRRT entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with KABB after Paramount sold channel 35 to Jet Broadcasting. In 1996, the Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired River City Broadcasting's television stations.\n\nThe following year, Glencairn, Ltd. (which evolved into Cunningham Broadcasting) bought KRRT; the family of Sinclair Broadcast Group founder Julian Sinclair Smith owned 97% of Glencairn's stock (Glencairn was, in turn, to be paid with Sinclair stock for the purchases), effectively making KABB and KRRT a duopoly in violation of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules of the period. Glencairn had owned eleven television stations nationwide that Sinclair operated under LMAs; a later plan to sell five of its stations to Sinclair outright prompted the Rainbow/PUSH coalition (headed by Jesse Jackson) to file challenges, citing concerns over a single company holding two broadcast licenses in one market and arguing that Glencairn passed itself off as a minority-owned company (its president, former Sinclair executive Edwin Edwards, is African American) when it was really an arm of Sinclair, and used the LMA to gain control of the station. The FCC levied a $40,000 fine against Sinclair in 2001 for illegally controlling Glencairn. Sinclair purchased KRRT outright in 2001, creating the market's first television duopoly with KABB.\n\nThe station originally carried Fox's children's program block Fox Kids when it switched to the network in January 1995 and also carried its successors FoxBox and 4Kids TV; the network later discontinued the Fox Kids weekday blocks in 2002, with the Saturday morning lineup remaining until September 2006, when KABB became the seventh Fox station that was not involved in the switches resulting from the network's 1994 affiliation agreement with New World Communications (after WSVN in Miami, KMSP-TV in Minneapolis, KPTV in Portland, Oregon, KMSB-TV in Tucson, KMPH-TV in Fresno and KPTM in Omaha) to stop carrying the network's children's program block; Fox Kids successor 4Kids TV block was moved to sister station KMYS to accommodate a short-lived weekend expansion of its morning newscast \"Fox News First\". The lineup remained on KMYS until 4Kids TV was discontinued by Fox (due to a dispute between the network and the block's lessee 4Kids Entertainment) in December 2008, after which Fox permanently discontinued providing network-supplied children's programming.\n\nOn May 15, 2012, the Sinclair Broadcast Group and Fox agreed to a five-year extension to the network's affiliation agreement with Sinclair's 19 Fox stations, including KABB, allowing them to continue to carry the network's programming through 2017.\n\nOn July 19, 2012, Sinclair announced that it would acquire NBC affiliate WOAI-TV (channel 4) from High Plains Broadcasting as part of its purchase of six television stations, along with the assumption of the operations of two others, from Newport Television. Since FCC duopoly regulations forbid common ownership of more than two full-power stations in a single market from being under the same ownership, Sinclair spun off KMYS to Deerfield Media; however, Sinclair retained control of KMYS through a shared services agreement (SSA). In addition, while FCC rules disallow ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in the same market, which normally precludes duopolies involving two \"Big Four\" network affiliates, Sinclair cited in its FCC purchase application that WOAI ranked as the fourth highest-rated station (behind Univision owned-and-operated station KWEX-DT (channel 41)) and KABB the fifth-rated station in the San Antonio market in total day viewership. The Sinclair and Deerfield Media deals were consummated on December 3, 2012.\n\nThe operations of KABB and KMYS initially remained separate from WOAI-TV, with the two stations retaining competing news operations. However, in October 2013, the \"San Antonio Express-News\" reported that Sinclair planned to move WOAI's sales, promotions and executive offices from its downtown San Antonio studios on Navarro Street to a new building adjacent to KABB and KMYS' shared Babcock Road facility; the transition of WOAI employees to the KABB/KMYS complex was finalized in the summer of 2014, with the completion of a shared newsroom on the second floor of the building that accommodates both WOAI and KABB's respective news staffs. The combined Sinclair news operation is the largest in the city.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed.\nOn August 24, 2010, Sinclair signed a groupwide affiliation deal with The Country Network (which rebranded as ZUUS Country in July 2013), a digital subchannel network featuring country music videos, to the 28 of the company's stations. On October 31, 2015, the station switched its subchannel to the Sinclair-owned Comet network. On February 13, 2017, the station added a third subchannel with the soft launch of TBD.\n\nOn February 2, 2009, Sinclair told cable and satellite television providers via email that regardless of the exact mandatory switchover date to digital-only broadcasting for full-power stations (which Congress rescheduled for June 12 days later), the station would shut down its analog signal on the original transition date of February 17, making KABB and KMYS the first stations in the market to convert to digital-only broadcast transmissions.\n\nKABB discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 29, on February 17, 2009. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 30, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 29.\n\nKABB preempts the network's \"Xploration Station\" E/I block (which airs Sunday mornings on KCWX), which replaced the \"Weekend Marketplace\" infomercial block (which, in return, replaced 4Kids TV in December 2008, and instead airs Saturday mornings on sister station KMYS). Syndicated programs broadcast by KABB include \"The Wendy Williams Show\", \"The Doctors\", \"Dr. Phil\", \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\", \"Family Feud\", \"2 Broke Girls\" and \"Two and a Half Men\" among others.\n\nKABB presently broadcasts 27⅓ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5⅓ hours each weekday and 30 minutes each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces the sports highlight program \"Maximum Sports\", which airs on weeknights during the final ten minutes of the 9:00 p.m. newscast and as a standalone half-hour program on Saturdays and Sundays at 9:30 p.m. as well as the lifestyle program \"Daytime at Nine\", which airs weekday mornings at 9:00 a.m.\n\nRiver City Broadcasting started a news department for KABB shortly before the company's merger with the Sinclair Broadcast Group. On March 20, 1995, the station began producing a half-hour prime time newscast at 9:00 p.m. each weeknight, originally titled \"The Nine O'Clock News\". The station expanded the weeknight broadcast of \"The Nine O'Clock News\" to one hour in 1998; this was followed by the addition of hour-long weekend editions of the 9:00 p.m. broadcast by 1999. In 1999, the station began to produce a half-hour late afternoon newscast at 5:30 p.m. for sister station KRRT, which utilized the same anchors, meteorologist and sports staff as that seen on KABB's 9:00 p.m. newscast. The program was canceled in 2001 due to low ratings.\n\nKABB programmed news outside its established 9:00 p.m. timeslot for the first time on channel 29 on January 2, 2006, when it premiered \"Fox News First\", a three-hour morning newscast that aired weekdays from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m., replacing infomercials and children's programs that had previously aired that time period. On September 8, 2008, the program was expanded to four hours, with the addition of an hour-long block from 5:00 to 6:00 a.m.\n\nKABB is one of the few local television newscasts in the United States to have syndicated its newscasts to other stations in nearby markets. Its morning and prime time newscasts also aired on Fox affiliates KIDY in San Angelo and KXVA in Abilene from September 2009 to September 2013 (simulcasts of \"Fox News First\" were added by both in October 2010) when the owner of those stations, London Broadcasting Company, launched half-hour prime time newscasts during the 9:00 p.m. hour; KXVA's MyNetworkTV-affiliated sister station KIDZ-LD rebroadcast KABB's 9:00 p.m. newscast nightly on a one-hour delay at 10:00 p.m. during the same timeframe.\n\nOn August 3, 2011, KABB became the fourth English-language television station in the San Antonio market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. One month later on September 6, KABB launched an hour-long lifestyle program \"Daytime @ Nine\", as a lead-out of its weekday morning newscast.\n\nUpon Sinclair's purchase of fellow Fox affiliate KSCC in Corpus Christi, KABB's morning block of news from 7 to 10 a.m. began to be simulcast on that station.\n\n"}

The album was released on November 17, 1995 by Nuclear Blast Records. This would be the band's last full-length album before Nödtveidt's 1997 incarceration for the felony murder of Josef ben Meddour. It would not be until 2006 that they would release their third and final album \"Reinkaos\", which was followed by Jon Nödtveidt's suicide and the breakup of the band. As with the band's debut album, Kristian 'Necrolord' Wåhlin created the artwork. The album is widely considered a masterpiece and one of the best black metal albums ever written. It has had significant influence on the development of extreme metal, inspiring many bands such as Watain, whose frontman played bass live with the band during their final shows.\n\nIn 1995, Nuclear Blast released a Europe-exclusive special digipak version of the album limited to 500 copies, which upon unfolding formed the shape of a cross with the song's lyrics printed on the sleeves. It was re-released in 2002 as a digipak (catalogue number: NB 646-2), this time with the 1997 EP \"Where Dead Angels Lie\" as bonus tracks. The Japanese edition features the bonus track \"Feathers Fell\" as track 5, in between \"Where Dead Angels Lie\" and \"Retribution – Storm of the Light's Bane\". The album was re-released once again in 2006 by The End Records in a two-disc set, and includes the \"Where Dead Angels Lie\" EP, an unreleased EP from 1994 featuring two songs from the album, and an \"alternate mix\" version of the full album, all remastered from the original master tapes by Håkan Åkesson at Cutting Room Studios, Stockholm, and packaged in a slipcase. This version is touted as the \"Ultimate Reissue\".\n\nThe album is notable for being one of the earliest and most successful examples of a band combining black metal with the melodic death metal sound that was developing in Gothenburg around the time of this album's release. According to \"Metal Hammer\", \"While Sweden's Dissection were very much black metal in terms of ideology and atmosphere, they also featured noticeable elements of the melodic death metal movement exploding in their home country, as well as classic '80s heavy metal.\" Dave Schalek wrote that \"the songs are cold, dark, evil and extreme.\" \"OC Weekly\" have described the album as \"extreme and aggressive but also primeval and classically orchestrated with heavy echoes of drums and haunting melodies hidden throughout the darkness.\"\n\nIn an interview, Jon Nödtveidt said that though \"everything we do is connected through death in one way or another. This is not an album where all the songs follow a story. On this record, all the songs and music are different but still have that death theme within them to tie them in some form or another.\" He also added that \"We never limit ourselves even if we feel we play dark, death metal. We don't write our music to fit into a certain pattern.\"\n\nThe album is routinely cited as a landmark album in the history of black metal, and as one of the earliest examples of a band blending black metal and death metal. In his review of the album for AllMusic, William York described all of the album's songs as \"expertly crafted mini-epics.\" He wrote that \"There is a strong sense of thematic unity tying each song's various riffs and sections together, and the soaring, darkly majestic guitar melodies are consistently memorable. Sure, there is a little bit of melodrama here, but Dissection is most certainly on top of their game, and Storm of the Light's Bane is deservedly hailed as a landmark in the melodic black/death metal genre.\" Sputnikmusic wrote that \"\"Storm of the Light’s Bane\" strives mainly for balance, and manages to easily succeed in this goal due to the sheer amount of attention to detail. The meticulous structure of each song gives the album a refined and almost polished feel, even with the fuzzy production values. While it’s a damn shame that Dissection weren’t able to create more material in their time together, \"Storm of the Light’s Bane\" will forever be the legacy that Nödtveidt and company leave behind.\" Metal Hammer named it one of the 20 best black metal albums of the 90s, noting the influence of melodic death metal, and describing it as \"a melodic, majestic and gloriously epic listen that features a measured, bombastic tone yet also makes use of furious, high-paced delivery when necessary.\" IGN included \"Storm of the Light's Bane\" in their \"10 Great Black Metal Albums\" list. Terrorizer named it the 8th best black metal album of all time, as well as one of the 100 'Most Important Albums of the Nineties'. This is a classic album in its genre.\" Loudwire describe it as a \"milestone in extreme metal\" and \"one to chill the bones and the only one of its kind.\"\n\nTrack listing adapted from liner notes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Fellows (May 29, 1865 – May 21, 1945) was an American inventor and entrepreneur from Torrington, Connecticut who designed and built a new type of gear shaper in 1896 and, with the mentoring of James Hartness, left the Jones & Lamson Machine Company to co-found the Fellows Gear Shaper Company in Springfield, Vermont, which became one of the leading firms in the gear-cutting segment of the machine tool industry. Fellows' machines made a vital contribution to the mass production of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. By the conclusion of World War II, Fellows Gear Shaper Company machines were in defense contractor plants, manufacturing geared components for aircraft engines, tanks, instruments, cameras, fuses and other war-time materiel.\n\nFellows' father, Charles L. Fellows, was a principal of Torrington High School and was interested in mathematics. When his father died, Fellows was in his first year of high school. As a result of his father's death, Fellows had to go to work as a department store clerk while his mother had to take on lodgers. One such lodger was James Hartness, who was to become a machine-tool entrepreneur in Springfield, Vermont and who befriended Fellows and ultimately convinced him to follow career opportunities in the Springfield machine-tool industry with his firm, the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J&L). Roe reports that Fellows completed high school.\n\nFellows moved to Springfield in 1889, working first at a screw-making machine before being transferred to the drafting department at J&L. In this capacity he became interested in the problem of manufacturing gears, which requires accurate shaping according to mathematical principles in many different forms, including spur gears, worm gears, helical gears and spiral bevel gears. The problem employs the \"study of involute cycloidal, epicycloidal and hypocycloidal curves.\"\n\nBy 1896 Fellows had fully developed a new approach to gear cutting. Previously, gears had been milled, using cutters that were formed to the shape of the individual teeth. Upon the completion of each gear tooth, the gear blank was indexed to a new position to mill the next tooth, which could lead to problems in accurate spacing of gear teeth and the shaping of the individual teeth. Fellows conceived a method whereby the gear cutter, which was itself a gear with hardened cutting edges, and gear blank revolved together as if they were a pair of gears. This process required no intermediate template or other type of mechanical guide for shaping the gear. Hobbing has become the preferred approach to manufacturing spur gears and helical gears.\n\nFellows obtained backing from several Springfield industrialists, including Hartness and William D. Woolson, who founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company on July 13, 1896. Fellows became manager of the company and Woolson the president. The company built a manufacturing facility in Springfield and ordered a prototype machine from Fitchburg Machine Works.\nThe first \"6-Type\" production machine was built in 1897 and sold to a Worcester, Massachusetts machine-tool firm. Sales were then slow until the advent of the mass-produced automobile. By 1911 the Fellows Gear Shaper Company was thriving with 37 percent of its production going to Europe. Fellows became president and general manager of the company in 1917. At this time the company had developed:\n\nBy 1924 the Fellows Gear Shaper Company, under the direction of Fellows, employed seven hundred men and was capable of producing one hundred gear shapers and four thousand cutters per month. Roe characterized the company's gear shapers as \"one of the most important tools in the manufacture of automobiles.\"\n\nDuring World War II the Fellows Gear Shaper Company plant was enlarged to a peak work force of 3,300, including 400 women. The company's gear shaping machinery spanned extremes in capability between being able to produce gears with a 100-inch pitch diameter (the diameter at the bottom of the tooth) to 1/16-inch pitch diameter. By the conclusion of the war, Fellows Gear Shaper Company machines were in defense contractor plants manufacturing geared components, including:\n\nFellows resigned as general manager in 1939, but remained president and director of the company until his death in 1945. Fellows gear shapers continued to be manufactured and supported by Bourn & Koch, Inc. of Rockford, Illinois, as of 2002.\n\nFellows received 39 patents pertaining to gear shaping, generating, grinding and measuring machines.\nThe Franklin Institute awarded him the John Scott Medal in 1899.\n\n\n"}

It is a Dungeons & Dragons PC video game using the \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\", Second Edition, Spelljammer rules. \"Spelljammer\" was programmed and designed by Cybertech Systems.\n\nIn the Spelljammer game the player captains a ship and crew. The player can ship goods from planet to planet for a fee, take on simple missions including, delivering people and goods, destroying pirates, and guarding the space lanes. As the player completes missions his character gains reputation points, eventually gaining enough points to be asked to help rid Realmspace of a terrible danger. This mission led to the simple plot in the game.\n\nSpelljammers are magic ships that fly through \"wildspace\" to various planets. All the planets and wildspace for a system are contained in a Crystal Sphere. Outside the Crystal Sphere is the Phlogiston, also known as the \"flow\". Holes in the Crystal Sphere allow the flow to shine through, appearing as stars on planets. Spelljamming ships cannot enter the Phlogiston.\n\nThe game starts the player with a 5th level character. The available classes are: Clerics, Fighters, Paladins, Rangers, Mages, and Thieves. There are three main parts to the game: docked at a planet, in space travel and ship-to-ship combat, and on-board personal combat. When at a planet, various text menus allowed the player to buy and sell cargo, repair and upgrade their ship, buy and sell character equipment, and seek missions. A rudimentary trade system allowed players to make money shipping goods from planet to planet, and some key planets had more options for ship repairs and equipment. In space, the player can travel from planet to planet, or simply point the ship in any direction and go. Real-time ship-to-ship combat using ballistae and catapults takes place in a simple 3D view. The player can steer his ship to aim the weapons at his enemy, and to try to avoid enemy missiles. The occasional meteor storm is a minor hazard while spelljamming.\n\nOne little-used feature programmed into the game was the ability to crash your ship into the Crystal Sphere. Normally \"space\" was shown as black, but if a player was patient and continued towards the Crystal sphere space would turn dark grey, light grey, the stars would spread out, and eventually the ship would crash into the Crystal Sphere.\n\nThe player can bring his ship close to the enemy ship, board, and do turn based hand-to-hand combat on a simple isometric map. A full range of spells and weapons is available, and ships are crewed by a wide range of humans and monsters. In the turn-based combat system, the player controls the ship's officers, and the computer controls the regular crew and the enemies. For a game released in 1992 the ship-to-ship combat was innovative for a D&D video game, but not cutting-edge technology compared to contemporary flight simulators. The turn-based combat engine was quite good for the time, supporting spell effects and animations on the map, for example a \"stinking cloud\" that persisted for multiple turns.\n\nAl Escudero was a successful game designer with a couple of commercial titles under his belt working out of Vancouver BC, Canada in 1990. Escudero had started design work on a space battle game for Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI), and put in a few months of effort before SSI decided to kill the project. Design work continued for as long as it did because the decision to kill the project did not trickle down to the level of management Escudero was dealing with for 2 months after upper management killed the project. To make up for the loss of time and money, SSI quickly found another project for Escudero – \"Spelljammer\".\n\nEscudero designed the ship to ship combat and came up with the idea of using a 2D map, then using the distance between ships to scale the size of the ship's bitmap and display it in a simple 3D view on one plane. He then designed the basic layout of all menus, the overall look and feel of the turn based hand-to-hand combat, and most other key parts of the game. At this time Cybertech Systems was actually just Escudero in his basement. Lead programmer Alex Russell was acquainted with him because he went to high-school with Russell's younger brother. Russell had done a couple of small porting jobs for Escudero in the past. Another programmer named David \"Zoid\" Kirsch worked on the game for a couple of months. As Russell had only been programming business systems up to now, Zoid's knowledge of PC hardware was valuable at the start of the project.\n\nEscudero worked on the art for the game, doing most of the planets, tiles, and much other minor art. Russell also did artwork, doing a few scenes used when at ports, and decorations for menus. They also used a black and white video camera (colour camera was much too expensive for the budget they were working on) and a RGB colour wheel to digitise models, both scale and human, to use for the game. An Amiga was used for digitisation. The Amiga could write to standard PC floppy disks, and Deluxe Paint on the Amiga would write files that PC Deluxe paint could read. Deluxe Paint, and Deluxe Paint Animation were used for 90% of the art. Three freelance artists drew the bulk of the ships and a few ports. Each ship required 8 hand drawn pictures, one for each of 8 rotations. These 8 pictures were then scaled as required for the semi 3D used in ship to ship combat. A 30-second Cybertech introduction of a door opening took 4 hours to render on a 486, and over 24 hours on a 386.\n\nCybertech hired a model builder to build one ship, but while this had good results it turned out the model builder couldn't turn a profit at the price they could pay for a custom model. The asteroids in the game were digitized rocks from Escudero's backyard. A few people in full armor from the local SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism), as well as friends in costumes were digitized as well.\n\nRussell did 90% of the programming. This was back before the widespread use of the internet, so personal contacts in the local game programming industry, and a good local book store were very important sources of information. 320x200 pixels, 256 colours was chosen for the video mode because it was simple to program, looked good, and would be faster to process a smaller number of pixels with many colours, than lots of pixels with only 16 colours. This was way before 3D cards – everything was done in software. Most of the game was written in C, except for all the graphic primitives which were written in x86 assembler.\n\nA menu system was written, but not a menu editor. All menus were hard-coded C structures, requiring a full recompile to see a menu change. The over-head turn based combat system had a very good editor written for it. Each ship in the game had its own map. And the semi 3D engine was written. SSI provided the sound library. There were no standards so each common sound card had to be supported. The other interesting routine was the movie player. It looked at a series of computer pictures, found and stored the differences and stored them as compressed blocks. Cybertech hired an assembly whiz to write the de-compressor. Russell wrote everything else from scratch. The team used some of Zoid's ideas, but none of his code made it into the final game.\n\nMusic was created by two of Russell's friends, Mark McGough and Peter Grisdale, who were also musicians as well as computer programmers. They already had MIDI equipment and did the music for a copy of the game and a credit listing.\n\nProgrammer Alex Russell recalls: \"We sent game builds down to SSI using a state of the art 9600 baud modem and Zmodem. It took about 3 hours to send down 2 megs of updates, and involved calling voice first, arranging for who would auto-answer (SSI so they could pay the phone bill!), and crossing your fingers.\"\n\nDevelopment took a little over a year. The first 6 months of work was done in Escudero's kitchen. Then SSI called up and said they were coming up to visit. Since Escudero didn't want to look like a low budget outfit he quickly rented a small office, where development was finished. After Spelljammer was finished, Escudero was instrumental in developing a multi-line BBS called Ice Online that ran a custom coded MUD. This turned out to be a quite successful enterprise that would eventually take up the whole floor of the building the original small office was in. EA eventually bought out Ice Online, took all the key employees and closed down the BBS.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" liked the boarding combat but criticized the bugs and long load times, concluding that the game \"is a product with a good deal of promise, thwarted by an unfortunate number of defects\". It recommended the game to \"AD&D role-playing stalwarts who can look past the problems\", but \"As to the rest of the gaming public, \"SJammer\" is still a few updates away from being a product worth playing\". The magazine warned that the \"grandiose claims\" SSI made about the game and \"Legends of Valour\" threatened the company's \"long-standing reputation for quality\". According to GameSpy, it was a \"nice try, but a so-called \"Gold Box\" game everyone can easily miss\".\n\n"}

It is a 10 inch pork wiener wrapped in a steamed bun. The hot dog is sold at Dodger Stadium located in Los Angeles, California. According to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council, the projected number of 2011 season hot dogs sold at Dodger Stadium was 2 million—establishing Farmer John Dodger Dogs as the leader in hot dog sales of all those sold in Major League Baseball ballparks.\n\nThere are two lines for Dodger Dog vendors: steamed or grilled. The vendors of the grilled dogs are typically located near the back wall of the stadium so that the smoke doesn't overwhelm the baseball fans. The grilled Dogs are considered the \"classic\" version.\n\nThe success of the Dodger Dog has spawned a small chain of restaurants in the Southern California area. One such restaurant named Dodger Dogs can be found in Universal City, California. The Dodger Dog is also available in the “Super Dodger Dog” variation, which is made of 100% beef as opposed to 100% pork. It is believed that Dodger Dogs were first called \"Dodger Dogs\" in 1958 when the Dodgers first came to Los Angeles from Brooklyn. Dodger Dog wieners are also sold to the public in Southern California supermarkets under the Farmer John brand. In 2011, the Dodgers introduced a Mexican-themed \"Doyer Dog\" which are made with chili, salsa, jalepeños, and condiments replacing the standard ketchup and mustard on a typical hotdog. \n\nThe Dodger Dog is also served at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City, OK, the home of the Dodgers AAA affiliate Oklahoma City Dodgers. A concession area called the \"Dog Pound\" serves hot dogs from stadiums around the country including the Fenway Frank, Cincinnati Cheese Coney, Milwaukee Brat, and The Red Hot Chicago Dog. The Dodger Dog was not, however, served at the Dodgers' spring training ballpark, Camelback Ranch, during the team's first spring training at the park. This was changed for the 2010 Spring Training season where the Dodger Dog was either cooked on a hot dog roller or steamed.\n\nThomas Arthur created the \"Dodger Dog\" during his 29 years (1962–1991) as the food concessions manager at Dodger Stadium. Originally, the 10 inch dog was sold as a \"Foot Long,\" but Thomas Arthur decided truth in advertising was the best path. He approached Walter O'Malley, majority owner of the Dodgers, and asked if the Hot Dog could be called a \"Dodger Dog\" which became such a staple for Dodger fans that Vincent Price described its deliciousness in his cookbook, \"Treasury of Great Recipes\". The 10-inch wiener was originally made by the Morrell Meat Company, but Farmer John, one of the Dodgers' chief sponsors, soon took over the hot dog needs of the stadium. Farmer John was purchased by Hormel in 2004. Farmer John was purchased from Hormel by Smithfield Foods in 2017.\n\n\n\n"}

The cemetery was established in 1848 as a public municipal cemetery of the town of Roxbury, but was privatized when Roxbury was annexed to Boston.\n\nForest Hills Cemetery is located in the southern part of Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. It is roughly bounded on the southwest by Walk Hill Street, the southeast, by the American Legion Highway, and the northeast by the Arborway and Morton Street, where its entrance is located. To the northwest, it is separated from Hyde Park Avenue by a small residential area. It abuts Franklin Park, which lies to the northeast, and is a short distance from the Arnold Arboretum to the northwest, and forms a greenspace that augments the city's Emerald Necklace of parkland.\n\nThe cemetery has a number of notable monuments, including some by famous sculptors. Among these are Daniel Chester French's \"Death Staying the Hand of the Sculptor\" and John Wilson's Firemen's Memorial. Forest Hills Cemetery is an active cemetery where interments take place on most days of the year.\n\nOn March 28, 1848, Roxbury City Council (the municipal board in charge of the area at that time) gave an order for the purchase of the farms of the Seaverns family to establish a rural municipal park cemetery. Inspired by the Mount Auburn Cemetery, Forest Hills Cemetery was designed by Henry A. S. Dearborn to provide a park-like setting to bury and remember family and friends. In the year the cemetery was established, another were purchased from John Parkinson. This made for a little more than at a cost of $27,894. The area was later increased to . In 1893, the first crematorium in Massachusetts was added to the cemetery, along with other features like a scattering garden, an indoor columbarium and an outdoor columbarium. In 1927, anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were cremated here after their execution; their ashes were later returned to Italy\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1838754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838754", "title": "Islam in Australia", "text": "Islam in Australia\n\nIslam in Australia is a minority religious affiliation. According to the 2016 Australian Census, the combined number of people who self-identified as Muslim in Australia, from all forms of Islam, constituted 604,200 people, or 2.6% of the total Australian population, an increase of over 15% of its previous population share of 2.2% reported in the previous census 5 years earlier. Of that earlier 2.2% figure, \"some estimate more than half are non-practicing\" cultural Muslims stemming from all the varying denominations and sects of Islam present in Australia.\n\nThat total Muslim population makes Islam, in all its denominations and sects, the second largest religious grouping in Australia, after all denominations and sects of Christianity (52.2%, also including practicing and non-practicing cultural Christians).\n\nDemographers attribute Muslim community growth trends during the most recent census period to relatively high birth rates, and recent immigration patterns. Adherents of Islam represent the majority of the population in Cocos (Keeling) Islands, an external territory of Australia.\n\nThe vast majority of Muslims in Australia belong to the two major denominations of Islam, the Sunni and Shia denominations, with the followers of each of these further split along different Madh'hab (schools of thought within Islamic jurisprudence for the interpretation and practice of Islamic law). There are also practitioners of other smaller denominations of Islam, including Ahmadiyya Muslim Australians of various national backgrounds, Ibadi Muslim Australians of Omani descent, as well as some non-denominational Muslims, and approximately 20,000 Druze Australians whose religion emerged as an offshoot of Islam which arrived in Australia with the immigration of Druze mainly from Lebanon and Syria. There are also Sufi (Islamic mysticism) minorities among Muslim practitioners in Australia.\n\nWhile the overall Australian Muslim community is defined largely by a common religious identity with \"Islam\", Australia's Muslims are not a monolithic community. The Australian Muslim community is fragmented into not only the traditional sectarian divisions of what each sect defines as Islam, but it is also extremely diverse racially, ethnically, culturally and linguistically. Different Muslim groups within the Australian Muslim community thus also espouse parallel non-religious ethnic identities with related non-Muslim counterparts, either within Australia or abroad.\n\nIndonesian Muslims trepangers from the southwest corner of Sulawesi visited the coast of northern Australia, \"from at least the eighteenth century\" to collect and process \"trepang\", a marine invertebrate prized for its culinary and medicinal values in Chinese markets. Remnants of their influence can be seen in the culture of some of the northern Aboriginal peoples. Regina Ganter, an associate professor at Griffith University, says, \"Staying on the safe grounds of historical method ... the beginning of the trepang industry in Australia [can be dated] to between the 1720s and 1750s, although this does not preclude earlier, less organised contact.\" Ganter also writes \"the cultural imprint on the Yolngu people of this contact is everywhere: in their language, in their art, in their stories, in their cuisine.\" According to anthropologist John Bradley from Monash University, the contact between the two groups was a success: \"They traded together. It was fair - there was no racial judgement, no race policy.\" Even into the early 21st century, the shared history between the two peoples is still celebrated by Aboriginal communities in Northern Australia as a period of mutual trust and respect.\n\nOthers who have studied this period have come to a different conclusion regarding the relationship between the Aboriginal people and the visiting trepangers. Anthropologist Ian McIntosh has said that the initial effects of the Macassan fishermen were \"terrible\", which resulted in \"turmoil\" with the extent of Islamic influence being \"indeterminate\". In another paper McIntosh concludes, \"strife, poverty and domination . . is a previously unrecorded legacy of contact between Aborigines and Indonesians.\" A report prepared by the History Department of the Australian National University says that the Macassans appear to have been welcomed initially, however relations deteriorated when, \"aborigines began to feel they were being exploited . . leading to violence on both sides\".\n\nA number of \"Mohammedans\" were listed in the musters of 1802, 1811, 1822, and the 1828 census, and a small number of Muslims arrived during the convict period. Beyond this, Muslims generally are not thought to have settled in large numbers in other regions of Australia until 1860.\n\nMuslims were among the earliest settlers of Norfolk Island while the island was used as a British penal colony in the early 19th century. They arrived from 1796, having been employed on British ships. They left following the closure of the penal colony and moved to Tasmania. The community left no remnants; only seven permanent residents of the island identified themselves as \"non-Christian\" in a 2006 census.\n\nAmong the early Muslims were the \"Afghan\" camel drivers who migrated to and settled in Australia during the mid to late 19th century. Between 1860 and the 1890s a number of Central Asians came to Australia to work as camel drivers. Camels were first imported into Australia in 1840, initially for exploring the arid interior (see Australian camel), and later for the camel trains that were uniquely suited to the demands of Australia's vast deserts. The first camel drivers arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, in June 1860, when eight Muslims and Hindus arrived with the camels for the Burke and Wills expedition. The next arrival of camel drivers was in 1866 when 31 men from Rajasthan and Baluchistan arrived in South Australia with camels for Thomas Elder. Although they came from several countries, they were usually known in Australia as 'Afghans' and they brought with them the first formal establishment of Islam in Australia.\n\nCameleers settled in the areas near Alice Springs and other areas of the Northern Territory and inter-married with the Indigenous population. The Adelaide, South Australia to Darwin, Northern Territory, railway is named The Ghan (short for The Afghan) in their memory.\n\nThe first mosque in Australia was built in 1861 at Marree, South Australia. The Great Mosque of Adelaide was built in 1888 by the descendants of the Afghan cameleers.\n\nDuring the 1870s, Muslim Malay divers were recruited through an agreement with the Dutch to work on Western Australian and Northern Territory pearling grounds. By 1875, there were 1800 Malay divers working in Western Australia. Most returned to their home countries.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded Islamic festivals celebrated in Australia occurred on 23 July 1884 when 70 Muslims assembled for Eid prayers at Albert Park, Melbourne. “During the whole service the worshippers wore a remarkably reverential aspect.”\n\nMost of the cameleers returned to their countries after their work had dried up, but a few had brought wives and settled in Australia with their families, and others settled either on their own (some living at the Adelaide Mosque), or married Aboriginal or European women. Halimah Schwerdt, secretary to Mahomet Allum, a former cameleer who established himself as herbalist, healer and philanthropist in Adelaide, became first European woman in Australia to publicly embrace Islam. She was engaged to Allum in 1935-37, but there is no record of a wedding. He married Jean Emsley in 1940, who converted to Islam later. Allam also published pamphlets and articles about Islam.\n\nFrom 1901, under the provisions of the White Australia policy, immigration to Australia was restricted to persons of white European descent (including white Europeans of the Muslim faith). Meanwhile, persons not of white European heritage (including most Muslims) were denied entry to Australia during this period, and those already settled were not granted Australian citizenship.\n\nNotable events involving Australian Muslims during this early period include what has been described either as an act of war by the Ottoman Empire, or the earliest terrorist attack planned against Australian civilians. The attack was carried out at Broken Hill, New South Wales, in 1915, in what was described as the Battle of Broken Hill. Two Afghans who pledged allegiance to the Ottoman Empire shot and killed four Australians and wounded seven others before being killed by the police.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s Albanian Muslims, whose European heritage made them compatible with the White Australia Policy, immigrated to the country. Albanian Muslims built the first mosque in Shepparton, Victoria in 1960, first mosque in Melbourne in 1963 and a mosque in Mareeba, Far North Queensland in 1970. The Albanian community in Far North Queensland settled in the area in the early 20th century searching for work in the sugarcane and tobacco industries with many descendants still living in Mareeba, Cairns and other small towns across the Atherton Tablelands.\nThe perceived need for population growth and economic development in Australia led to the broadening of Australia's immigration policy in the post-World War II period. This allowed for the acceptance of a number of displaced white European Muslims who began to arrive from other parts of Europe, mainly from the Balkans, especially from Bosnia and Herzegovina. As with the Albanian Muslim immigrants before them, the European heritage of these displaced Muslims also made them compatible with the White Australia Policy.\n\nWith the increase in immigration of Muslims after the war from countries such as Cyprus, Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and Russia, the Islam in Australia developed its characteristic plurality. The move proved enriching for Muslim migrants, who \"met Muslim fellows from many different ethnic, racial, cultural, sectarian and linguistic backgrounds\" and \"found Islam more pluralistic and more sophisticated\" than their countries of origin.\n\nLater, between 1967 and 1971, during the final years of the step-by-step dismantling of the White Australia policy, approximately 10,000 Turkish citizens settled in Australia under an agreement between Australia and Turkey. From the 1970s onwards, there was a significant shift in the government's attitude towards immigration, and with the White Australia policy now totally dismantled from 1973 onwards, instead of trying to make newer foreign nationals assimilate and forgo their heritage, the government became more accommodating and tolerant of differences by adopting a policy of multiculturalism.\nLarger-scale Muslim migration of non-White non-European Muslims began in 1975 with the migration of Lebanese Muslims, which rapidly increased during the Lebanese Civil War from 22,311 or 0.17% of the Australian population in 1971, to 45,200 or 0.33% in 1976. Lebanese Muslims are still the largest and highest-profile Muslim group in Australia, although Lebanese Christians form a majority of Lebanese Australians, outnumbering their Muslim counterparts at a 6-to-4 ratio.\n\nTrade and educational links have been developed between Australia and several Muslim countries. Muslim students from countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, are among the thousands of international students studying in Australian universities.\n\nA number of Australian Arabs experienced anti-Arab backlash during the First Gulf War (1990–91). Newspapers received numerous letters calling for Arab Australians to \"prove their loyalty\" or \"go home\", and some Arab Australian Muslim women wearing \"hijab\" head coverings were reportedly harassed in public. The Australian government's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission included accounts of racial harassment experienced by some Australian Arabs in their 1991 report on racism in Australia.\n\nBy the beginning of the 21st-century, Muslims from more than sixty countries had settled in Australia. While a very large number of them come from Bosnia, Turkey, and Lebanon, there are Muslims from Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Fiji, Albania, Sudan, Somalia, Egypt, the Palestinian territories, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, among others. At the time of the 2011 census, 476,000 Australians (representing 2.2 percent of the population) reported Islam as their religion.\n\nOn a few occasions in the 2000s and 2010s, tensions have flared between Australian Muslims and the general population. The Sydney gang rapes formed a much-reported set of incidents in 2000; a group of Lebanese men sexually assaulted non-Muslim women. In 2005, tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in the Cronulla area of Sydney led to violent rioting; the incident resulted in mass arrests and criminal prosecution. In 2012, Muslims protesting in central Sydney against \"Innocence of Muslims\", an anti-Islam film trailer, resulted in rioting. There was an increase in anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the Sydney hostage crisis on 15–16 December 2014, including a threat made against a mosque in Sydney. However, the Muslim community also received support from the Australian public through a social media campaign.\n\nThe founding president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils has said that with moderate Muslims being sidelined by those promoting more fundamentalist views, there is a need to be more careful in regard to potential Australian immigrants. Keysar Trad has said moderate Muslims need to take back control. An article in \"The Australian\" in May 2015 opined, \"Most Muslims want the peace and prosperity that comes from an Islam that coexists with modernity; it is a fanatical fringe that seeks to impose a fabricated medieval Islam\". It describes Dr Jamal Rifi as a brave insider who is working to assist \"the cause of good Muslims who are struggling for the soul of Islam\".\n\nMost Australian Muslims are Sunni, with Shia then Sufi and Ahmadiyya as minorities.\n\nIn Sydney, adherents of the Sunni denomination of Islam are concentrated in the suburb of Lakemba and surrounding areas such as Punchbowl, Wiley Park, Bankstown and Auburn.\n\nIn Australia there are also groups associated with the \"hardline\" Salafi branch of Sunni Islam, including the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia and Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association (Australia) (ASWJA). While their numbers are small, the ASWJA is said to \"punch above its weight\".\n\nThere are communities of NSW Muslims who adhere to Tablighi Jamaat form of Islam and worship at the Granville, Al Noor Masjid, which is led by Sheik Omar El-Banna. Similarly many Bangladeshi Tablighi Jamaat, Muslims worship at mosques in Seaton, NSW and in Huntingdale Victoria.\n\nDawateislami, which is a \"non-political Islamic organisation based in Pakistan\", has adherents in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Wikileaks cables released information that Saudi Arabia closely monitores the situation of Islam and Arab community in Australia, whilst at the same time spending considerately to promote its fundamentalist version of Sunni Islam within the country.\n\nThe Shi'a denomination of Islam is centred in the St George, Campbelltown, Fairfield, Auburn and Liverpool regions of Sydney, with the al-Zahra Mosque, built in Arncliffe in 1983, and the Al-Rasool Al-A'dham Mosque serves the region in Bankstown. In 2008, the mainstream Shia community numbered 30,000 followers nationally.\n\nIn October 2004 Sheikh Mansour Leghaei established the Imam Hasan Centre in Annangrove, NSW.\n\nIn November 2014, up to 3,000 Shi'a Muslims marched in Sydney on the annual Ashura Procession to mark the death of the prophet's grandson. In November 2015 there was Ashura march in Sydney and a Victorian school observed Muharram.\n\nThere are also others from smaller non-mainstream sects of Shia Islam, including approximately 20,000 Alawites from Turkish, Syrian and Lebanese backgrounds. They have at least one school called \"Al Sadiq College\", with campuses in the Sydney suburbs of Yagoona and Greenacre. There is also a population of the related, though distinct, Alevis.\n\nThere is also an Ismaili population of unspecified size. While Dawoodi Bohra, a small Ismaili Shia sect has its Sydney Jamaat located in Auburn NSW.\n\nAdditionally, the Druze, who practice Druzism, a religion that began as an offshoot of 11th-century Ismaili Shiite Islam, are reported to have around 20,000 followers living in Australia.\n\nThe study of the history of Sufism in Australia is a fledgling discipline. Initial examination indicates that the Sufis have played an important part in Muslim engagement with Australia and its peoples.\n\nSome of the cameleers who came from Afghanistan, India and other countries in the 19th century were Sufis. Baron Friedrich von Frankenberg, who was inspired by the man who first brought to the West, Inayat Khan, moved to Australia from Germany with his family in 1927. He was, according to research fellow Dzavid Haveric, a \"pioneer of the Sufi movement in Australia\". The baron and his Australian wife were well-liked, and students would study Sufism under von Frankenberg at their home in Camden, New South Wales. In 1939 he organised the visit of a renowned Sufi leader, or Murshida, and devotee of Khan, known as Murshida Rabia Martin. Born Ada Ginsberg, the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants to the US, Martin's visit was of great significance because of her link to Khan. After the baron's death in 1950, the poet and artist Francis Brabazon, student of Meher Baba, another early spiritual teacher took up a leadership role.\n\nCurrently there are communities representing most of the major Sufi Orders within Australia. There are communities of Sufis, estimated to number about 5,000, most notably the Ahbash, who operate under the name \"Islamic Charitable Projects Association\". The communities are linked to Darulfatwa - Islamic High Council of Australia and run Al Amanah College, as well as a mosque and a community radio station in suburban Sydney. There have been tensions between the Ahbash and other Muslim communities.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya community is reported to have 3,000 followers in Australia. There are 4 Ahmadiyya mosques in Australia in Sydney; Masjid Bait-ul Huda, Melbourne; Masjid Bait-ul Salam, Brisbane; Masjid Bait-ul Masroor and Adelaide; Masjid Mahmood. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has its headquarters located at the Masjid Bait-ul Huda, Marsden Park to the west of Sydney.\n\nThe leaders of the Ahmadiyya community condemn terrorism, support law enforcement authorities, advocate speaking English and being loyal to Australia. Ahmadiyya Muslim Association Australia national spokesman Aziz Omer said, \"We are loyal to Australia and we want our kids to be loyal to Australia\", with association members delivering 500,000 \"Loyalty to Homeland\" leaflets.\n\nAhmadi Muslims have been subject to various forms of intra-Muslim religious persecution and discrimination.\n\nConflict between religious groups in the Middle East are reflecting as tensions within the Australian community and in the schools.\n\nThe Australian Muslim community has built a number of mosques and Islamic schools, and a number of imams and clerics act as the community's spiritual and religious leaders. In 2007, Hilaly was succeeded by Fehmi Naji in June 2007 who was succeeded by the current Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed in September 2011.\n\nFatwas, edicts based on Islamic jurisprudence which aim to provide \"guidance to Muslim Australians in the personal, individual and private spheres of life\", are issued by various Australian Islamic authorities.\n\nA number of organisations and associations are run by the Australian Islamic community including mosques, private schools and charities and other community groups and associations. Broad community associations which represent large segments of the Australian Muslim public are usually termed \"Islamic councils\". Some organisations are focused on providing assistance and support for specific sectors within the community, such as women.\n\nTwo organisations with strong political emphasis are Hizb ut-Tahrir which describes itself as a, \"political party whose ideology is Islam\" and Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association (ASWJA).\n\nA number of financial institutions have developed Sharia-compliant finance products, with university courses leading to Islamic financial qualifications also being established. Other Australian Islamic organisations have been set up to manage sharia-compliant investments, superannuation, Islamic wills and zakat management.\n\nThere are close to two dozen Halal certification authorities in Australia. Halal meat and meat product exports to the Middle East and Southeast Asia have greatly increased from the 1970s onwards; this expansion was due in part to efforts of the AFIC. Halal certification has been criticised by anti-Halal campaigners who argue that the practice funds the growth of Islam, results in added costs, a requirement to officially certify intrinsically-halal foods and with consumers required to subsidise a particular religious belief.\n\nAn inquiry by an Australian Senate committee, which concluded in December 2015, found the current system is \"lacklustre\" and made recommendations for improvement. It found there was no evidence to support claims that the profits of halal certification are used to fund terrorism. The report recognised that halal certification has economic benefits for Australia because of increased export opportunities. It recommended that the federal government increase its oversight of halal certifiers to address fraudulent conduct, with halal products to be clearly labelled and for meat products sourced from animals subject to religious slaughter, to be specifically labelled.\nIt said that it had heard, \"credible reports suggesting that the lack of regulation has been unscrupulously exploited\". In tabling the report, committee chairman Sam Dastyari said, \"Some certifiers are nothing more than scammers.\"\nThe committee recommended a single halal certification authority. The committee in recommending clearer labelling, specifically referred to the need for meat processors to label products sourced from animals subject to religious slaughter.\n\nDuring the 1980s the Australian Muslim population increased from 76,792 or 0.53% of the Australian population in 1981, to 109,523 or 0.70% in 1986. In the 2011 Census, the Muslim population was 479,300 or 2.25%, an increase of 438% on the 1981 number.\n\nThe general increase of the Muslim population in this decade was from 147,487 or 0.88% of the Australian population in 1991, to 200,885 or 1.12% in 1996.\n\nIn 2005 the overall Muslim population in Australia had grown from 281,600 or 1.50% of the general Australian population in 2001, to 340,400 or 1.71% in 2006. The growth of Muslim population at this time was recorded as 3.88% compared to 1.13% for the general Australian population.. From 2011-2016, Muslim population grew by 27% from 476,291 to 604,200 with majority residing in New South Wales.\n\nThe following is a breakdown of the country of birth of Muslims in Australia from 2001:\n\nThere were 281,578 Muslims recorded in this survey; in the 2006 census the population had grown to 340,392. 48% of Australian-born Muslims claimed Lebanese or Turkish ancestry.\n\nThe distribution by state of the nation's Islamic followers has New South Wales with 50% of the total number of Muslims, followed by Victoria (33%), Western Australia (7%), Queensland (5%), South Australia (3%), ACT (1%) and both Northern Territory and Tasmania sharing 0.3%.\n\nThe majority of people who reported Islam as their religion in the 2006 Census were born overseas: 58% (198,400). Of all persons affiliating with Islam in 2006 almost 9% were born in Lebanon and 7% were born in Turkey.\n\nAccording to the , the Muslim population numbered 604,235 individuals, of whom 42% live in Greater Sydney, 31% in Greater Melbourne, and 8% in Greater Perth. The states and territories with the highest proportion of Muslims are New South Wales (3.58%) and Victoria (3.32%), whereas those with the lowest are Queensland (0.95%) and Tasmania (0.49%).\n\n4.2% of people in Greater Melbourne are Muslim. Many Muslims living there are Bosnian and Turkish. Melbourne's Australian Muslims live primarily in the northern suburbs surrounding Broadmeadows, (mostly Turkish), Coburg, Brunswick and Epping (mostly Lebanese) and a few in the outer southern suburbs such as Noble Park and Dandenong (mainly Bosnian).\n\nVery few Muslims live in rural areas with the exceptions of the sizeable Turkish and Albanian community in Shepparton, which has Victoria's oldest mosque, and Malays in Katanning, Western Australia. A community of Iraqis have settled in Cobram on the Murray River in Victoria. There has been an established Albanian Muslim community in Mareeba, Far north Queensland from the 1920s, where they established Queensland's second oldest mosque. \n\nPerth also has a Muslim community focussed in and around the suburb of Thornlie, where there is a mosque. Perth's Australian Islamic School has around 2,000 students on three campuses.\n\nMirrabooka and Beechboro contain predominantly Bosnian communities. The oldest mosque in Perth is the Perth Mosque on William Street in Northbridge. It has undergone many renovations although the original section still remains. Other mosques in Perth are located in Rivervale, Mirrabooka, Beechboro and Hepburn.\n\nThere are also communities of Muslims from Turkey, the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) and South-East Asia, in Sydney and Melbourne, the Turkish communities around Auburn, New South Wales and Meadow Heights and Roxburgh Park and the South Asian communities around Parramatta. Indonesian Muslims, are more widely distributed in Darwin.\n\nIt is estimated that Australian Muslims come from 63 different backgrounds, with \"loose associations\" between them.\n\nAccording to Australia's 2011 census, 1,140 people identify as Aboriginal Muslims, almost double the number of Aboriginal Muslims recorded in the 2001 census. Many are converts and some are descendants of Afghan cameleers or, as in the Arnhem Land people, have Macassan ancestry as a result of the historical Makassan contact with Australia. In north east Arnhem Land, there is some Islamic influence on the songs, paintings, dances, prayers with certain hymns to Allah and funeral rituals like facing west during prayers, roughly the direction of Mecca, and ritual prostration reminiscent of the Muslim sujud. As a result of Malay indentured laborers, plenty of families in Northern Australia have names like Doolah, Hassan and Khan. Notable Aboriginal Muslims include the boxer Anthony Mundine and Rugby League footballer Aidan Sezer. Many indigenous converts are attracted to Islam because they see a compatibility between Aboriginal and Islamic beliefs, while others see it as a fresh start and an aid against common social ills afflicting indigenous Australians, such as alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nSome academics who have studied these issues have come to less positive conclusions regarding the relationship between the Aboriginal people and the visiting trepangers. \n\nAccording to the 2016 Australian Census, Bangladeshi origin population were around 55,000; among them about 33,000 were living in NSW. Bangladeshi Muslims are located primarily in Rockdale, Lakemba, Bankstown and many suburbs in Western Sydney region with a mosque in Sefton and in the south-east of Melbourne, with a mosque at Huntingdale. The Sefton Mosque has been linked to the Tablighi Jamaat School of Islam and has hosted Hizb ut-Tahrir. For Bangladeshi Muslims attending the Huntingdale Mosque, all Islamic lunar months, such as Ramadan are observed using local moon-sightings, rather than being based on Middle-Eastern, or other, timings.\n\nBosnian Muslims have predominantly arrived in Australia after 1992, with most of the community living in the south east of Melbourne and in the south west of Sydney. There are Bosnian run mosques in Deer Park, Noble Park, and Penshurst.\n\nEgyptian Muslims in Sydney are represented by The Islamic Egyptian Society. The Society has managed the Arkana College in Kingsgrove since 1986. It is reported that enrolments for its 203 co-educational places are booked out until 2020.\n\nIraqi Muslims mainly came to the country as a refugees after the Iran–Iraq War, failed 1991 uprisings in Iraq, and then post-2003. They predominately settled in the western suburbs of Sydney, such as Fairfield and Auburn.\n\nKurdish Muslims have predominantly arrived in Australia since the second half of the 1980s, with most of the community settling in Melbourne and Sydney. Although the large majority of the Kurdish Australians are Muslims, there are no registered Kurdish run mosques in Australia.\n\nLebanese Muslims form the core of Australia's Muslim Arab population, particularly in Sydney where most Arabs in Australia live. Approximately 3.4% of Sydney's population are Muslim. Approximately 4.2% of residents in Greater Melbourne are Muslim, and Sydney Road in Brunswick and Coburg is sometimes called 'Little Lebanon'.\n\nIn November 2016, Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton said that it was a mistake of a previous administration to have brought out Lebanese Muslim immigrants. Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop said Mr Dutton was making a specific point about those charged with terrorism offences. \"He made it quite clear that he respects and appreciates the contribution that the Lebanese community make in Australia\".\n\nAlthough the first Somali community in Victoria was established in 1988, most Somalis began to settle in the country in the early 1990s following the civil war in Somalia. Somalis are active in the wider Australian Muslim community, and have also contributed significantly to local business.\n\nTurkish Muslims are a significant segment of the Australian Muslim community. Some statistical reports forecast the Turkish Muslim population in Australia surpassing the Lebanese Muslim population in the 2020s and 2030s. Melbourne has the largest Turkish community in Australia, with the majority of Turkish Muslims living around Broadmeadows and other northern suburbs. The majority of Turkish Muslims in Sydney are from Auburn, Eastlakes and Prestons. Despite still having a large Turkish population in Auburn and Eastlakes, many Turks moved out of these areas and moved to Prestons to be close to the new and growing Turkish private school, Amity College which is run by people closely affiliated with the Galaxy Foundation (formerly Feza Foundation).\n\nConcerns and contemporary issues facing the Australian Muslim community include rates of unemployment, the rights of women, concerns over Islamism and Islamic radicalism, among others.\n\nIslamic preachers and clerics in Australia have been covered in the Australian press on account of the messages they have delivered publicly to the Muslim community or have otherwise shared with others in public settings. In some instances, various ideas and viewpoints espoused by these preachers have been subject of public or internal debate. Statements viewed as misogynistic and radically paternalistic have come under criticism.\n\nA number of incidents have highlighted the issues associated with radical Islam in Australia, including terrorism and militant activity.\n\nSeveral foreign terrorist organisations have sponsored the establishment of cells in Australia, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Jemaah Islamiah. Al-Shabaab is believed to have been behind the Holsworthy Barracks terror plot. A man known as \"Ahmed Y\" established a small militant group in Australia in 2001 and advocated the idea of establishing an Islamic State in Australia. Groups led by Abdul Nacer Benbrika and Khaled Cheikho were active in Melbourne and Sydney, respectively, until police arrested their members in 2005. Instances of domestic terror inspired by radical political Islam include the plots by Faheem Khalid Lodhi, Abdul Nacer Benbrika and Joseph T. Thomas.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), proscribed by the government as a terrorist organisation, has targeted Australian Muslims for recruitment. Making use of social media, recruiters target those vulnerable to radicalisation, and encourage local jihad activities. Some of those targeted have been minors, including a teenager who was arrested in Melbourne in May 2015 for plotting to detonate home-made bombs. In June 2014, the government claimed that roughly 150 Australians had been recruited to fight in the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. A list released in April 2015 showed that most were young males who have come from a range of occupations, including students. It was also reported at the time that 20 Australians had been killed fighting overseas for terror groups, with 249 suspected jihadists prevented from leaving Australia. The Border Force Counter-Terrorism Unit, tasked with stopping jihadists from leaving the country, had cancelled more than 100 passports by the end of March 2015. Several jihadists have expressed the desire to return to Australia, but Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said that any who do would be prosecuted on their arrival.\n\nIn December 2015 the Director General of ASIO Duncan Lewis stated that the number of Australians seeking to travel overseas to fight with groups such as ISIS had \"plateaued a bit\" due to better awareness of the issue among the Islamic community, few young Australians being attracted to ISIS and improvements to the speed with which passports could be cancelled. He also stated that a \"tiny, tiny\" proportion of Australian Muslims were influenced by ISIS. At this time the government believed there were around 110 Australians fighting with extremist groups, which was slightly lower than previous levels, and 44 Australians had been killed in Syria.\n\nIn an Australia-wide survey published in November 2015, which was based on 1,573 interviews, which asked, \"What is the likelihood that Islamic State will carry out a large scale terrorist attack in Australia?\" 24% of the respondents said \"it is inevitable\", 23% said \"very likely\" and 29% said \"likely\". Greens' voters were least concerned about an attack.\n\nIn May 2017, answering the questions during the Australian Senate-hearing, Duncan Lewis, the director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, stated that there's de facto no connection between refugees and terrorism in Australia whilst adding: \"But the context is very important. The reason they are terrorists is not because they are refugees but because of the violent, extremist interpretation of Sunni Islam that they have adopted.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia has been involved in the funding of Sunni-Salafi mosques, schools and charitable organisations, a university and Australian Islamic institutions, with estimates up to $120 million. This funding has generated tensions between Australian Muslim organisations. In 2015, it was uncovered by WikiLeaks, that the Saudi Government has provided finance to build Salafi mosques, to support Sunni Islamic community activities and to fund visits by Sunni clerics to \"counter Shiite influence\".\n\nThe leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir has said that the Jews \"are evil creatures\", and the principal of Al-Taqwa College told students that ISIL is a scheme created by Israel. An Islamic bookstore in Lakemba was found to be selling a children's book that describes Jews as \"much conceited\" and intent on world domination.\n\nSheik Taj el-Din al-Hilali, former Grand Mufti of Australia said, \"Jews try to control the world through sex, then sexual perversion, then the promotion of espionage, treason and economic hoarding\" with Christians and Jews being, \"the worst in God's creation\". At a Victorian university, a Muslim group held workshops based on the teachings of Islamic scholars who have recommended the death penalty for homosexuals and apostates, promoted terrorism and preached hatred of Jews and Christians.\n\nA Sheik who leads a Sydney prayer hall, told a group including children, that Jews, \"don't have mercy. They don't have anything in the heart. They've got only envy (and) they've got hatred\". Dvir Abramovich, a Jewish community leader, said he was deeply troubled by Sheik Hassan’s \"divisive rhetoric\".\n\nMaterial sold at some Sunni Islamic bookshops have raised concerns. For example, the Islamic Information Bookshop in Melbourne was stocking literature \"calling for violence against non-Muslims\"; the Al Risalah Bookshop was said to be \"encouraging young Australians to fight in Syria\"; and the Al-Furqan Bookshop was said to be polarising members with extreme views.\n\nThe Bukhari House Islamic Bookshop in Auburn, New South Wales, which is aligned to the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association has featured heavily in counter-terrorism raids. The gunman responsible for the 2015 Parramatta shooting is said to have spent his final days under the influence of Bukhari House leaders.\n\nIn Brisbane, the iQraa Bookstore was said to promote extremism. It was reported in 2015 that the al-Furqan and al-Risalah bookshops had both closed, but concern has been raised that this might be the \"worst thing that could happen\" as they provided a place for people to go to \"express their frustrations\".\n\nA number of forums and meetings have been held about the problem of extremist groups or ideology within the Australian Islamic community. After the London bombings in 2005, Prime Minister John Howard established a Muslim Community Reference Group to assist governmental relations with the Muslim community.\n\nSydney's Muslim leaders, including Keysar Trad, have condemned the actions of suicide bombers and denounced ISIS. The Shia community in Australia have also expressed their concern regarding ISIS. In February 2015, Ameer Ali former president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils called on religious leaders to oppose Islamic State as, \"I haven't heard so far any single imam in this country that has named IS and condemned it.\"\n\nGlenn Mohammed a Muslim lawyer has written, \"Muslims need to be able to discuss these issues openly and denounce barbaric behaviour. Instead, we choose to remain silent and then criticise a government that tries to make Australia safer.\" Psychiatrist Tanveer Ahmed has examined underlying causes and has identified the significance of issues relating to 'family' and to 'denial'. He has said, \"Muslim youths have unique difficulties in coming to terms with their identity, especially when they have conflicting value systems at home compared with school or work\".\n\nIn September 2014, the external affairs secretary of Australia's Ahmadiyya muslims, urged the Islamic community to denounce ISIS, \"because they know very well that ISIS is responsible for brutal, reprehensible killings of Muslims in Syria and Iraq\".\n\nPeter Jennings, Executive Director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has said Australian Muslim leaders need to recognise that there are a \"disturbing number of radicalised ideologues\" who do not believe Islam is peaceful. He says, \"some dramatic self-healing is needed\".\n\nIn May 2015, the Abbott Government committed a further AU$450 million to fight home-grown terrorism.\n\nMuslim leaders have criticised the current Grand Mufti of Australia, following the Muftis response to the November 2015 Paris attacks. Ameer Ali has said, \"The problem I have with the Mufti is he cannot communicate in English. That means he has to rely on the people around him.\" Anthony Albanese described the Grand Mufti's contribution as \"completely unacceptable\". Josh Frydenberg along with other senior politicians have urged moderate Islamic leaders to speak with one voice against extremism.\n\nThe founder of Australia’s biggest Muslim media organisation Ahmed Kilani is seeking a \"revolution\" within the Islamic community and has called upon Muslim leaders to unequivocally repudiate violence conducted in the name of Islam. Dr Recep Dogan of Charles Sturt University’s \"Centre for Islamic Sciences and Civilisation\", said as Muslim leaders in Australia do not seem to be engaged at a community level. \nDuring an interview on ABC Lateline program, the authors of a book entitled \"Islam and the Future of Tolerance\", Sam Harris, an atheist and neuroscientist, and Maajid Nawaz, a former Hizb-ut-Tahrir member, argued that Islam has failed to modernise. Harris said, \"We have a task ahead of us, a monumental task ahead of us, and that is to begin the process of adapting, reinterpreting our scriptures for the modern day and age.\" Politician Andrew Hastie has said, \"Modern Islam needs to cohere with the Australian way of life, our values and institutions. In so far as it doesn’t, it needs reform.\" Former federal Treasurer, Peter Costello has said, \"Islamic scholars need to tell would-be jihadis, why these difficult sections of the Koran and the Hadiths,\" which may have been acceptable in the 7th century, \"are not to be taken literally and not to be followed today\".\n\nFormer Prime Minister, Tony Abbott has said, \"there needs to be a concerted ‘hearts and minds’ campaign against the versions of Islam that make excuses for terrorists\".\n\nHowever, Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia) spokesman, Uthman Badar, said, \"Islam is not up for negotiation or reform. Islam is what it is.\" Hizb ut-Tahrir advocates capital punishment for apostates. Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane has said that Hizb ut-Tahrir's views are, \"absurd.\"\n\nIn December 2015 the Grand Mufti of Australia and several high profile imams issued a new year's message supporting a fatwa against Islamic State. In the message they stated that \"most Islamic Legal Circles and Fatwa Boards have condemned ISIS\", and warned young people to avoid the organisation's propaganda.\n\nIn March 2017, the Prime Minister said that since September 2014 Australian security forces have disrupted 12 planned domestic attacks and charged 62 people with terrorist-related offences.\n\nIn December 2018, Australian authorities stripped a jihadist who had fought for ISIS and was held in Turkey on terror-related charges of his Australian citizenship. He had left Australia for Syria in 2013. The jihadist had both Australian and Fijian citizenship and according to Australian law, an individual holding dual citizenship can be stripped of citizenship if convicted or suspected of terror offences.\n\nAccording to some scholars, a particular trend of anti-Muslim prejudice has developed in Australia since the late 1980s. Since the 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York, and the 2005 Bali bombings, Islam and its place in Australian society has been the subject of much public debate.\n\nA report published in 2004 by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission pointed to many Muslim Australians who felt the Australian media was unfairly critical of, and often vilified their community due to generalisations of terrorism and the emphasis on crime. The use of ethnic or religious labels in news reports about crime was thought to stir up racial tensions.\n\nAfter the White Australia immigration laws were replaced with multicultural policies the social disadvantage of Muslims was thought to have been alleviated. Some sources, however, note that Muslims now face some disadvantages on account of their religion. At times there has been opposition to the construction of new mosques in Australia. A 2014 report from the Islamic Sciences and Research Academy, University of Western Sydney, on mosques in New South Wales found that 44 percent of mosques in the state had \"experienced resistance from the local community when the mosque was initially proposed\". In around 20 percent of these cases opposition was from a small number of people.\n\nAccording to Michael Humphrey, a professor of sociology at the University of Sydney, much of Islamic culture and organisation in Australia has been borne of the social marginalisation experiences of Muslim working class migrants. This \"immigrant Islam\" is often viewed by the host society as a force of \"cultural resistance\" toward the multicultural and secular nature of the general Australian culture. Muslim practices of praying, fasting and veiling appear as challenging the conformity within public spaces and the values of gender equality in social relationships and individual rights. The immigrant Muslims are often required to \"negotiate their Muslimness\" in the course of their encounters with Australian society, the governmental and other social institutions and bureaucracies.\n\nA poll of nearly 600 Muslim residents of Sydney released in November 2015 found that the respondents were three to five times more likely to have experienced racism than the general Australian population. However, approximately 97 per cent of the Muslim respondents reported that they had friendly relations with non-Muslims and felt welcome in Australia.\n\nIn an Australia-wide survey published in November 2015, which was based on 1,573 interviews, which asked, \"Are Muslims that live in Australia doing enough to integrate into the Australian community, or should they be doing more?\", only 20% of respondents thought Muslims are currently \"doing enough\".\n\nA poll conducted by the University of South Australia's International Centre for Muslim and non-Muslim Understanding which was released in 2016 found that 10 per cent of Australians have hostile attitudes towards Muslims. The accompanying report concluded that \"the great majority of Australians in all states and regions are comfortable to live alongside Australian Muslims\".\n\nA \"Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia Inc\" has been established. An Australian speaking tour by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, was proposed for April 2017. Because of her alleged Islamophobia, the \"Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia\" told organisers that there would be 5,000 protesters outside the Festival Hall in Melbourne if she was to speak at that venue. Her Australian tour was cancelled. It is likely that Austrlain Muslims are facing up to Six Times exclusion from the society.\n\nAs part of the broader issue of women's rights and Islam, the gender inequality in Islam has often been the focal point of criticism in Australia through comparisons to the situation of women in Islamic nations. Muslim women can face hurdles both from within the Muslim community and from the wider community. Following a successful appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal by a Muslim lady, who believes it is a sin to be seen without a niqab, the policy of the Monash hospital is now for female doctors to attend to female patients, if requested. Several Melbourne councils have women-only sessions in their swimming pools. Monash Council has provided a curtain to ensure privacy for Muslim women.\n\nIt has been reported that a \"growing number of Muslim men [have] multiple wives\"; the same story cited Islamic Friendship Association of Australia president Keysar Trad as stating that there were \"not many more than 50\" polygamist Muslim families in Australia. Centrelink has been paying spousal benefits to Islamic families with several wives, with Centrelink saying that the payment of spousal benefits for multiple wives is done to save taxpayers’ money, rather than paying single-parent-benefits for each wife.\n\nThe AFIC has advocated Australian Muslims being able to marry and divorce under the principles of Sharia law, saying that Australian Muslims should enjoy \"legal pluralism\". There are Sharia law based mediation centres in Sydney and Melbourne. To expedite a religious divorce, Australian Muslim women often agree to sharia law principles which result in an unequal distribution of assets and rights. A Melbourne based, Muslim lawyer has said, \"his clients, almost all female, say they have been disadvantaged by Sharia settlements.\"\n\nAt a major Sydney mosque women are required to remain behind tinted glass on the second floor.\n\nThe leader of the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia, Samir Abu Hamza has told his followers that it is permissible to hit women as a, \"last resort\" but, \"you are not allowed to bruise them . . . or to make them bleed\". In response, he said that his message was taken out of context.\n\nIn March 2016 the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal determined that separate male and female seating arrangements at public events hosted by Hizb ut-Tahrir contravened section 33 of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act. The Tribunal ordered that all future publicity materials for public events hosted by Hizb ut-Tahrir must clearly inform attendees that segregated seating arrangements are not compulsory.\n\nIn May 2016 the United Muslims of Australia held a conference in Sydney where genders were separated by a fence.\n\nThe president of the Australian National Imams Council, Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman has said that women would be \"hung by their breasts in hell\" and women should not look at men. He has also said that women must obey their husbands to enter paradise.\n\nIn February 2017 the promotional flyers for an Islamic Peace Conference, organised by the Islamic Research and Educational Academy, the three females had their faces replaced with black ink, while the faces of all other 12 male speakers were displayed.\n\nIn February 2017, in response to a question regarding the meaning of Quran Chapter 4, Surah 34, Keysar Trad president of the AFIC said a husband can beat his wife, but only as \"a last resort\". He later apologised for his statements conceding Islam does allow for this, but saying he was \"clumsy\" in the television interview, adding that he condemns all violence against women. In April 2017 Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia) produced a video in which two women discussed how to resolve marital conflicts. One of the women said, \"a man is permitted to hit a woman as an act of discipline\" and described the permissive text as \"beautiful\" and \"a blessing\". The video was strongly repudiated by Muslim leaders, with the women subsequently saying, \"more thought needs to be given to the question of purpose, worth and risk of sharing content online. We acknowledge our mistake in this respect in this instance\".\n\nIt has been reported that female circumcision has been carried out in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. The act has been a criminal offence since the 1990s. The first criminal trial concerning female circumcision in Australia ended with the conviction of three members of the Dawoodi Bohra Shia Muslim community in November 2015 and in 2016 a community leader was imprisoned. There are reportedly 120,000 migrant women living in Australia who have had their genitals mutilated.\n\nA study, conducted by researchers from the Australian paediatric surveillance unit at Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney, has determined at least 60 Australian girls, from the age of 6 months, have undergone female genital mutilation.\n\nThe school uniform at Sydney's Al-Faisal College \"thought to have the strictest uniform policy for girls in the country\" requires summer and winter, ankle-length dresses, long-sleeved shirts, plus head covering, for girls, while the boys can wear short-sleeved shirts - has been described as discriminatory.\n\nThere have been prosecutions under Australian law in regards to Islamic marriages involving underage girls. There have been allegations of failure by Australian authorities to respond to reports of child brides. However, the Australian Federal Police has stated that it is unable to follow up on the reports as they concern alleged child marriages which occurred before specific legislation outlawing the practice came into effect in March 2013, and the legislation was not retrospective.\n\nAt a Sydney school, Muslim boys were told not to shake the hands of females presenting awards at the school. The instruction is understood to derive from an Islamic hadith which says, \"it is better to be stabbed in the head with an iron needle than to touch the hand of a woman who is not permissible to you\". There are claims that another Sydney public school is, \"run like a mosque\" with the school refusing to adopt a program aimed at countering violent religious extremism. The principal of the school was removed.\n\nIn line with the views of most Islamic scholars world wide, Islamic leaders in Australia generally believe that homosexuality is not permitted by their faith.\n\nIn June 2016, the president of the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC), Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman participated in an Iftar dinner at Kirribilli House hosted by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said he would not have been invited Alsuleiman had he known of his position regarding homosexuals. The sheikh had previously spoken about the \"evil actions\" of homosexuality. Australia's Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed has defended Alsuleiman, saying Islam has a, \"longstanding\" position on homosexuality\" which \"no person can ever change\". He said that any attempt to call out its teachings could lead to radicalisation. ANIC treasurer Imam Mohamed Imraan Husain said, \"Islam prevents lesbianism and being gay.\" Uthman Badar spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia), said that Mr Turnbull was condemning the \"normative Islamic position on homosexuality\".\n\nYusuf Peer, president of the Council of Imams Queensland, in referring to the sharia law death penalty for homosexuality said, \"that is what Islam teaches and that will never change.\" The Imam of Australia's largest mosque, located in Lakemba, NSW, Shaykh Yahya Safi has said, \"In Islam we believe it's a major sin to have such relations between men and men, a sexual relation. We don't discuss this because it's obvious.\"\n\nIn August 2017 the National Imams Council issued a statement opposing the proposed introduction of same-sex marriage in Australia, and several individual religious leaders have also argued against same-sex marriage. However, some Australian Muslims support same-sex marriage, and the Muslims for Progressive Values and Muslims for Marriage Equality groups have campaigned in favour of such a reform. As of September 2017 there was no polling data on the Australian Islamic community's views on this issue.\n\n, average wages of Muslims were much lower than those of the national average, with just 5% of Muslims earning over $1000 per week compared to the average of 11%. Unemployment rates amongst Muslims born overseas were higher than Muslims born in Australia. Muslims are over-represented in jails in New South Wales, at 9% to 10% of the prison population, compared to less than 3% within the NSW population.\n\nThere are a number of notable works in Australian literature that discuss the Muslims during the \"Afghan period\" (1860-1900).\n\n\"Veiled Ambition\" is a documentary created by Rebel Films for the SBS independent network following a Lebanese-Australian woman named Frida as she opens a shop selling fashionable clothing for Muslim women on Melbourne's Sydney Road. The documentary follows Frida as she develops her business in Melbourne while juggling a husband and home in Sydney and a pregnancy. \"Veiled Ambition\" won the Palace Films Award for Short Film Promoting Human Rights at the 2006 Melbourne International Film Festival.\n\n\"Ali's Wedding\" is an Australian film based on a true story of an Iraqi Shia immigrant family.

{"id": "1838755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838755", "title": "Inverloch (webcomic)", "text": "Inverloch (webcomic)\n\nInverloch is a series of five fantasy graphic novels authored by Sarah Ellerton drawn in a cel-shaded manga style. \"Inverloch\" was initially published as a webcomic with new content introduced several pages at a time from 2003 to 2007. Three volumes have seen print with the first three volumes currently available from IndyPlanet and with the first two originally published by Seven Seas Entertainment. \"Inverloch\" received several nominations in the 2005, 2006 and 2007 Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards, winning the Outstanding Fantasy Comic category in 2005. During its web publication \"Inverloch\" was highly rated at both Topwebcomics and buzzComix online comic rating sites.\n\nThe story of \"Inverloch\" follows the journey of Acheron and his companions to find the whereabouts of the elf Kayn'dar. It was scripted in December 2003, although it was constantly edited and refined throughout its production.\n\n\"Inverloch\" author Sarah Ellerton was already an experienced artist before she began the project, and says she chose to create a webcomic as a means of improving her art. Ellerton wrote out the script for the entire comic ahead of time, in December 2003, as a five-volume series. She began illustrating the comic in June 2004, updating twice a week with several new pages uploaded per update, and finished the comic in 2007.\n\nAfter finishing \"Inverloch\", Ellerton began work on a second webcomic (the plot and setting of which are unrelated to those of \"Inverloch\"), called \"The Phoenix Requiem\". That comic, like \"Inverloch\", consists of five volumes and has a total of 800 pages; the last page was published on March 17, 2011.\n\nTo create each page of \"Inverloch\", Ellerton planned out the panels with sketches on paper and then drew and colored them in Adobe Photoshop using a Wacom graphics tablet. She drew each panel individually, rearranging, resizing, and organizing them in Photoshop. Each page is in book format, and the size and shapes of the panels within each page varies.\n\nVolume 1 of \"Inverloch\" was published in print form on May 15, 2006. Ellerton redrew the first five pages for the published version, saying that the artistic style had changed since those pages were originally produced. Volume 2 was published on November 15, 2006.\n\nThe story of \"Inverloch\" begins when Acheron, a young da'kor, forms an unlikely friendship with Shiara, an elf. When Shiara reveals to him that her childhood love, Kayn'dar, disappeared twelve years earlier, Acheron promises to find him for her. When he explains to his mother that he will be leaving, it becomes apparent to him that his mother, brother, and uncle all know something about Kayn'dar, but are unwilling to tell him. Before leaving, Acheron also visits his uncle Selak, who gives him a pendant that was once owned by Kayn'dar.\n\nAcheron first sets out to find Lei'ella, an elven woman whom one of the da'kor says can help him find Kayn'dar. While searching for her in the human town of Strathwood, he is assaulted by Berard, a human criminal who captures da'kor to use in gladiatorial fighting rings. At that moment Lei'ella appears and rescues him, after which he explains his goal and she agrees to join him. From there they travel to Rhyll, where Acheron catches a thief named Varden trying to steal from him; Varden claims that he must now serve Acheron, according to the \"thieves' code,\" and Acheron allows him to join their group. At Lei'ella's suggestion, they go to Aydensfell, a city inhabited by humans who have traces of elven blood and study magic. The Archmage of Aydensfell tells Acheron that he should seek someone named Silvah, rather than Kayn'dar, and allows a young mage named Neirren to join them.\n\nThe group then travels to a city called Muirfold to search for Silvah. In the city they split up to ask about his whereabouts, and Acheron is captured by Berard, who had been following them. To rescue Acheron and prevent Berard from following them in the future, Varden approaches Berard and requests to fight Acheron in the gladiatorial ring. There, Varden wounds Acheron with a poisoned blade to make him appear dead, and kills Berard. They then take Acheron out of the city, where he eventually reawakens.\n\nFrom there, the group finds an old watchtower and enters it, ultimately finding Silvah, a white-haired elf, inside. Silvah explains to them that Kayn'dar had been killed, and that he is living in the watchtower to perfect his magical abilities in order to avenge Kayn'dar. The groups leaves the watchtower, and then Lei'ella explains to the group that because Silvah is a white-haired and golden-eyed elf like her but can still use magic (whereas Lei'ella, like most elves of that variety, have no magical abilities), then \"Silvah\" must be Kayn'dar, since before disappearing Kayn'dar had been famous as the only white-haired elf to possess magical powers. They return to the watchtower to confront Silvah, and Lei'ella accuses him of throwing away the only hope for elves such as them. Angered, and worried about his secret getting out, Silvah stabs Lei'ella, and then flees with Raul, the former archmage who is now involved in Silvah's plan. Acheron is able to heal her, however, using Kayn'dar's pendant, which possesses the memories and spirit of Kayn'dar.\n\nOnce recovered, Lei'ella explains to the group that both she and Kayn'dar are \"severed elves\": elves who were born without their connection to nature, and thus are mortal like humans and unable to use magic. Kayn'dar, however, was able to use magic as a child, and thus had been seen as a savior for the severed elves.\n\nThe group returns to Aydensfell, the city of mages, and the Archmage explains to them that the kidnapping of Kayn'dar had, in fact, been orchestrated by himself and Raul, as an attempt to learn more about elven healing magic. When the experiment had failed, Raul and \"Silvah,\" the personality that inhabited Kayn'dar's body, had left and become recluses. Acheron, Lei'ella, Varden and Neirren decide to go back to the forest of Inverloch and seek aid from the elves. They determine that, if there is a way overcome Silvah and restore Kayn'dar's soul, they will first have to get him away from Raul's influence.\n\nIn the forest, Lei'ella soon feels the presence of Raul, alone, and Neirren goes out to face him, telling the rest of the group to continue on without her. They go on and find Silvah at the ruins of Inverloch, preparing a spell that will sever all elves from nature. Also at the ruins is Shiara, powerless to stop Silvah. Together, they begin to fight Silvah, hoping to wear him down to the point that he is unable to cast the spell. Meanwhile, Neirren defeats Raul, and before he dies she absorbs his memories and knowledge into herself. She goes to where the others are fighting Silvah, and helps Silvah kill Acheron.\n\nWhen Acheron dies, Silvah suddenly stops fighting, and collapses. When he awakens, he identifies himself as Kayn'dar, and has all of Acheron's memories. He reveals to the others the details of his kidnapping twelve years before: Raul had, as an experiment, caused Kayn'dar's spirit and the spirit of Silvah, a da'kor, to exchange bodies. Kayn'dar's spirit had entered Silvah's body and become Acheron. Silvah, the da'kor whose spirit had taken Kayn'dar's body, desired revenge against the elves who had killed his father, which is why he had ultimately desired to sever all the elves. When he killed Acheron, Silvah's spirit had also died, allowing Kayn'dar's spirit to return to its elven body and thus restoring Kayn'dar.\n\nWith Silvah and Raul dead, the group retires to the elven city. Varden and Lei'ella eventually leave for Muirfold to start a life together, and Neirren, armed with Raul's knowledge, returns to Aydensfell to pursue her magical studies. Shiara is, at first, angry at Kayn'dar for killing Acheron, for whom she had had strong feelings, but eventually realizes Kayn'dar still is Acheron.\n\n\nIn a review of the first \"Inverloch\" volume, \"IGN\"'s A.E. Sparrow stated that \"Inverloch\" is \"a great story that I'm sure I'll be reading and re-reading for some time, both online and in print,\" rating the book a \"must have\".\n\n\"Inverloch\" has been nominated for a large number of Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards, winning three awards. In 2005, \"Inverloch\" won the \"Outstanding Fantasy Comic\" category, tying with \"The Order of the Stick\". In 2006, \"Inverloch\" was nominated in twelve categories, winning the \"Outstanding Long Form Comic\" award. In 2007, \"Inverloch\" tied with \"Gunnerkrigg Court\", winning in the \"Outstanding Environment Design\" category.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838756", "title": "Paramount chief", "text": "Paramount chief\n\nA paramount chief is the English-language designation for the highest-level political leader in a regional or local polity or country administered politically with a chief-based system. This term is used occasionally in anthropological and archaeological theory to refer to the rulers of multiple chiefdoms or the rulers of exceptionally powerful chiefdoms that have subordinated others. Paramount chiefs were identified by English-speakers as existing in Native American confederacies and regional chiefdoms, such as the Powhatan Confederacy and Piscataway Native Americans encountered by English colonists in the Chesapeake Bay area of North America.\n\nMore recently, Paramount Chief is a formal title created by British administrators during the 19th and 20th-century Colonial era and used in India, Africa and Asian colonies. They used it as a substitute for the word \"king\" to maintain that only the British monarch held that title. Since the title \"chief\" was already used in terms of district and town administrators, the addition of \"\" was made so as to distinguish between the ruling monarch and the local aristocracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhan, alternately spelled lowercase as khan and sometimes spelled as \"Han\", \"Xan\", \"Ke-Han\", Turkic: \"khān\", , Chinese: 可汗 or 汗, \"kehan\" or \"han\") is an originally Central Asian title for a sovereign or military ruler, first used by medieval Turko-Mongol nomadic tribes living to the north of China. 'Khan' is first seen as a title in the Xianbei confederation for their chief between 283–289 and was used as a state title by the Rouran confederation.\nIt was subsequently adopted by the Göktürks before Turkic peoples and the Mongols brought it to the rest of Asia. In the middle of the sixth century it was known as \"Kagan – King of the Turks\" to the Persians.\n\nIt now has many equivalent meanings such as commander, leader, or ruler. The most famous khan was the Great Khan of Mongols: Genghis Khan. Another famous Manchu khan was Nurhachi.\n\nHuguan Siou is the paramount leader for the Kadazandusun Murut indigenous community in Sabah. The current and the second Huguan Siou is Joseph Pairin Kitingan. The office is near sacred and can be left vacant if no one is deemed worthy to hold the title.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838769", "title": "Pickoff", "text": "Pickoff\n\nIn baseball, a pickoff is an act by a pitcher, throwing a live ball to a fielder so that the fielder can tag out a baserunner who is either leading off or about to begin stealing the next base.\n\nA pickoff attempt occurs when this throw is made in an attempt to make such an out or, more commonly, to \"keep the runner close\" by making it clear that the pitcher is aware and concerned with the runner's actions. A catcher may also attempt to throw runners out who likewise \"stray too far\" from their bases after a pitch; this can also be called a pickoff attempt. A runner who is picked off is said to have been \"caught napping\", especially if he made no attempt to return to his base.\n\nA pickoff move is the motion the pitcher goes through in making this attempt; some pitchers have better pickoff moves than others. Pitchers in professional baseball use the pickoff move often, perhaps several times per game or even per inning if speedy baserunners reach base. Pitchers with more confidence in their ability to eliminate batters directly via strikeouts or flyouts use fewer pickoff attempts. In lower-skilled amateur games, the pickoff move is less common due to the potential for an error if the pitcher throws wild or the fielder fails to make the catch. In youth leagues that don't allow leading off, such as Little League and Cal Ripken League, the need for a pickoff move is eliminated.\n\nA pitcher uses many tactics to attempt to disguise whether he is going to begin a pitch or a pickoff attempt. However, some deceptive actions are illegal and may be called a balk.\n\nWhen there is a baserunner, the pitcher will pitch from the stretch, one of the pitching positions. For this example we will say the runner is on first base. From the set position a right-handed pitcher can still see the baserunner out of the corner of his eye. A left-handed pitcher has a clear view of the baserunner because of his position on the pitcher's mound. If it is a right-handed pitcher there is only one main method of this pickoff move. This involves a quick shuffle of the pitcher's feet to turn towards first base and throw the ball to the first baseman. The first baseman will then attempt to tag out the runner. The left-handed pitcher, due to their natural stance and the way they are facing, has multiple moves. The two main methods are called the \"snap throw\" and \"spin move\". The snap throw is when the pitcher quickly lifts his back foot behind the pitching rubber and slings the ball to the first baseman. A snap throw can also refer to the catcher throwing the ball to the base following a pitch. The spin move is when the pitcher lifts his leg like he is going to pitch the ball but then rotates his body toward first and throws the ball. The pitcher will try to vary this move by doing this move while looking at the runner or at the batter, which can be deceiving to the baserunner. A former pickoff move in Major League Baseball used mostly by right-handed pitchers was called \"third to first\" and could only be done if there were baserunners on first and third. It was performed by the pitcher faking a pickoff at third, then stopping, spinning and throwing the ball to first base instead. This move was used to try to get the base-runner or the batter to disclose what action they were going to perform on the pitch. Former Kansas City Royals right-hander, Steve Busby, is credited for popularizing the \"third to first\" move, and Jeff Nelson was also known for using it. After the 2012 season, Major League Baseball instituted a rule change defining this move as a balk.\n\nThere are a few reasons to use this tactic:\n\nAlong with having a good, quick pickoff move, a number of other techniques can be used to help cut down on base-runners getting good jumps at stealing bases. First off, changing look patterns keeps the runner off balance and keeps him from timing out the pitcher and guessing when he can take off. An experienced pitcher learns how to mix up his looks and never allow himself to get into a predictable pattern. The most common occurrence of a pitcher falling into a pattern occurs with a runner on second base. It is very easy for a pitcher to repeatedly look just once at the runner and then start the pitching motion as the head turns to pick up home plate again. This makes base-runners have a very easy time at getting a good start at stealing third base. A second method to cut down on giving up stolen bases is to have a quick delivery to the plate. This can be done with a slide step quite easily, however this is not necessary. A slide step tends to make the pitcher not get as much momentum going to the plate, therefore causing the pitch to lose velocity. To counteract this, a pitcher can do a quick leg kick to get momentum going while not taking a long time. The technique to do this is to lift the leg with the knee going up in an inward motion towards the push leg. The entire pitching motion from the first movement until the ball hits the catcher's glove should take around 1.3–1.5 seconds. By keeping the time under 1.3 seconds, very few runners should be able to steal on even an average-armed catcher. The most important rule to remember while pitching with base-runners on is to stay relaxed. Being tense makes a pitcher much more prone to committing a balk.\n\nA baserunner with a reputation for stealing bases, can also take advantage of the pitcher's desire to hold them to their base, as a means to throw off the pitcher's concentration. By taking a large lead, the runner can hope to force the pitcher to make mistakes, therefore helping the batter, by improving their chances at the plate. Prolific base stealers can accomplish this without a true intention to steal any base at all. Pitchers should be aware of this, and take care not to attempt to pick-off a runner, to the point of fatigue or losing focus on the batter.\n\nOn August 24, 1983, Tippy Martinez of the Baltimore Orioles picked off three consecutive Toronto Blue Jays base runners in the first half of the 10th inning. The catcher for the Orioles, utility infielder Lenn Sakata, had replaced the backup catcher at the start of the inning. Sakata hadn't played as a catcher since Little League, and the Blue Jays thought it would be easy to steal off him. In the bottom half of the same inning, Sakata hit a walk-off home run.\n\nGame 4 of the 2013 World Series ended with a pickoff, as Koji Uehara of the Boston Red Sox threw to first base, causing St. Louis Cardinals' runner Kolten Wong to be tagged out.\n\nPickoff records are imprecise, as it is not an official MLB statistic, and historical box scores typically did not distinguish between a pickoff and a caught stealing.\n\n\"Records per Baseball-Reference.com\"\n\n\n\"Records per MLB.com\"\n\n\nNote that each of the pitchers listed in this section is left-handed.\n\n"}

It also significantly extended and simplified the powers of arrest of a constable and introduced restrictions on protests in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster. It was introduced into the House of Commons on 24 November 2004 and was passed by Parliament and given Royal Assent on 7 April 2005.\n\nMeasures to introduce a specific offence of \"incitement to religious hatred\" were included in early drafts of the Act, but then dropped so the bill would pass before the 2005 general election. The offence has since been created by the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006.\n\nThe Act applies principally to England and Wales but s.179 permits the extent or designates sections applying only to Scotland and/or Northern Ireland; additionally s.179(9) extends the application of four sections (ss.172, 173, 177, 178) beyond the United Kingdom to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.\n\nThe Act introduced changes to the powers of arrest utilised by both \"constables\" and \"other persons\" in England and Wales. The term arrestable offence ceased to have effect as, bar a few preserved exemptions, one power of arrest now applies to all offences when the arrest is made by a constable. Where the threshold of an arrestable offence was previously used to enable specific powers of search or powers to delay certain entitlements, these powers are preserved, but the threshold is changed to that of an indictable offence.\n\nSubject to an overriding requirement that an arrest is reasonably required and that no less intrusive way of advancing the investigation is reasonably available (the \"Necessity Test\"):\nthe constable may arrest without a warrant anyone who is about to or is in the act of committing an offence, or anyone they have reasonable grounds to suspect of committing or being about to commit an offence. They may also arrest anyone they have reasonable grounds to believe is guilty of an offence they suspect has been committed. These powers to arrest only apply if one or more of the following reasons apply:\n\nGiven the scope of the last two provisions, a new Code of Practice was issued for guidance.\n\nThese changes were enacted on 1 January 2006.\n\nThe Act is controversial primarily for sections 132 to 138, which restrict the right to demonstrate within a \"designated area\" of up to one kilometre from any point in Parliament Square. Demonstrators must give written notice to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police six days in advance, or if this is not reasonably practicable then no less than 24 hours in advance.\n\nThe area itself is defined by a Statutory Instrument, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Designated Area) Order 2005, rather than the Act. It specifically excludes Trafalgar Square, a traditional site of protest on the northern boundary of the area. Apart from Parliament it also includes Whitehall, Downing Street, Westminster Abbey, the Middlesex Guildhall, New Scotland Yard, and the Home Office. It also covers a small section of land on the other bank of the River Thames, including County Hall, the Jubilee Gardens, St Thomas' Hospital and the London Eye.\n\nThese provisions of the Act were introduced partially as a result of Brian Haw and his Parliament Square Peace Campaign. Haw was a peace campaigner, who from 1 June 2001 until his death on 18 June 2011 protested against Britain and the United States' policy towards Iraq. He used placards and a loudspeaker to get his message across, which some British MPs found disruptive. Patrick Cormack MP said in a Parliamentary debate on 7 February 2005 that the lives of \"members of staff in Portcullis House and 1 Parliament Street, as well as the police who are on duty at Members entrance day after day ... are made intolerable by those people baying away, without a crowd to address, merely repeating themselves \"ad nauseam\".\"\n\nHowever, others, such as Jeremy Corbyn MP disagreed, saying \"The Minister should think carefully about removing rights that are enshrined in our history\", and Glenda Jackson MP agreed with him, saying \"I regard it as the voice of democracy\". Lembit Öpik MP drew attention to the comments of the Prime Minister Tony Blair, who, on 7 April 2002, said: \"When I pass protestors every day at Downing Street ... I may not like what they call me, but I thank God they can. That's called freedom.\" The Home Office stated the security concerns, such as the possibility of explosive devices being left in and around Haw's paraphernalia, were another reason for the legislation.\n\nThe legislation initially appeared ineffective against Mr Haw. The High Court of Justice ruled that as Haw's protest had begun in June 2001 he was not required to get authorisation. The three-strong judicial panel accepted arguments by Mr Haw's lawyers that the law only applied to demonstrations that took place after it came into force, not those previously in progress. However, on 8 May 2006, this decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 1 August 2005, the day that the Act came into force, the Stop the War Coalition and others organised a protest against the prohibition. They did not officially ask for permission, but at the subsequent court cases it was revealed that the Stop the War Coalition had negotiated with police about the protest. The action attracted some 200 people according to reports – among them Lauren Booth, Tony Blair's sister-in-law – and five people were arrested.\n\nThe first conviction under the Act was in December 2005, when Maya Evans was convicted for reading the names of British soldiers killed in the Iraq War, near the Cenotaph in October, without police authorisation.\n\nIn 2006, the comedian and political activist Mark Thomas attacked this section of the act by organising several protests within the area, within the confines of the law. His most notable was when he organised 21 protests over the course of a single day within the area. This act got Thomas into the Guinness Book of Records for taking part in the most protests in a single day. However, as the first and last protest took place in the same location, only 20 protests are recognised by Guinness.\n\nIn January 2007 Tate Britain opened \"State Britain\", an installation by artist Mark Wallinger that recreated the display confiscated by the police from Brian Haw's protest. The Tate press release on the exhibition mentioned that the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 prohibited \"unauthorised demonstrations within a one kilometre radius of Parliament Square\" and that this radius passed through the Duveen Hall, literally bisecting Wallinger's exhibit. Wallinger marked this on the floor with a black line running through the Tate. Press reports dwelt on the potential dangers of this infringement, speculating that the police might even remove the half of the exhibit on the \"wrong\" side of the line. Charles Thomson of the Stuckists art group wrote to \"The Guardian\", pointing out that the exclusion zone ended at Thorney Street, 300 yards before the Tate.\n\nGordon Brown said that he planned to look again at this section of the SOCPA, meaning that protesters would eventually be able to protest freely in the kilometre-radius of parliament without prior authorisation being needed. In October 2007, the Home Office published a public consultation document, \"Managing Protest Around Parliament\", which \"takes another look at sections 132–138 [of SOCPA] and explores whether there is another way to address the situation that would both uphold the right to protest while also giving police the powers they need to keep the peace\". Campaigners are worried that this document contains new threats to freedom of assembly and the right to protest in that is suggests that there could be \"harmonisation of powers to manage marches and assemblies\" throughout the UK.\n\nSections 132 to 138 of the Act were repealed by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which provides for a different scheme of \"prohibited activities\" on Parliament Square.\n\nSOCPA also amended the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 so that \"pursuing a course of conduct\" amounting to harassment could mean approaching two people just once, rather than one person at least twice, as before. Commentators such as George Monbiot have voiced the concern that the amended Harassment Act effectively \"allows the police to ban any campaign they please\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838808", "title": "Needlefish", "text": "Needlefish\n\nNeedlefish (family Belonidae) or long toms are piscivorous fishes primarily associated with very shallow marine habitats or the surface of the open sea. Some genera include species found in marine, brackish, and freshwater environments (e.g., \"Strongylura\"), while a few genera are confined to freshwater rivers and streams, including \"Belonion\", \"Potamorrhaphis\", and \"Xenentodon\". Needlefish closely resemble North American freshwater gars (family Lepisosteidae) in being elongated and having long, narrow jaws filled with sharp teeth, and some species of needlefishes are referred to as gars or garfish despite being only distantly related to the true gars. In fact, the name \"garfish\" was originally used for the needlefish \"Belone belone\" in Europe and only later applied to the North American fishes by European settlers during the 18th century.\n\nNeedlefish are slender, ranging from in length. They have a single dorsal fin, placed far back on the body, almost opposite to the anal fin. Their most distinctive feature is their long, narrow beak, which bears multiple sharp teeth. In most species, the upper jaw only reaches its full length in adults, so the juveniles have a half-beak appearance, with an elongated lower jaw, but a much smaller upper one. During this stage of their lifecycle, they eat plankton, switching to fish once the beak fully develops. Needlefish reproduce through mating and lay eggs. The male usually rides the female on the waves as they mate.\n\nAll needlefish feed primarily on smaller fishes, which they catch with an upward sweep of their heads. In addition, some species also take krill, swimming crustaceans, and small cephalopods. Saltwater species are also predatory, with the Indian species at least feeding exclusively on large crustaceans.\n\nNeedlefish are most common in the subtropics, but some inhabit temperate waters, as well, particularly during the winter. \"Belone belone\", a common North Atlantic species, often swims in schools alongside tuna.\n\nNeedlefish, like all ray-finned beloniforms, are capable of making short jumps out of the water at up to . Since needlefish swim near the surface, they often leap over the decks of shallow boats rather than going around. This jumping activity is greatly excited by artificial light at night; night fisherman and divers in areas across the Pacific Ocean have been \"attacked\" by schools of suddenly excited needlefish diving across the water towards the light source at high speed. Their sharp beaks are capable of inflicting deep puncture wounds, often breaking off inside the victim in the process. For many traditional Pacific Islander communities, who primarily fish on reefs from low boats, needlefish represent an even greater risk of injury than sharks.\n\nOccasional deaths and serious injuries have been attributed to needlefish. In 1977, a 10-year-old Hawaiian boy, night fishing with his father at Hanamaulu Bay, Kaua'i, was killed when a needlefish jumped from the water and pierced his eye and brain. In 2007, a 16-year-old Vietnamese boy was stabbed through the heart by the beak of a needlefish while diving for sea cucumbers at night near Halong Bay.\n\nIn 2010, a kayaker in Florida was nearly killed when a houndfish (\"Tylosurus crocodilus\") leapt from the water and impaled her in the chest. In 2012, German kitesurfer Wolfram Reiners was seriously wounded in the foot by a needlefish near the Seychelles. In May 2013, a kitesurfer in Egypt's Red Sea was speared directly under his knee when a needlefish jumped out of the water. In October 2013, a Saudi Arabian news website also reported the death of a young Saudi man in Dammam who died of hemorrhaging after being hit by a needlefish on the left side of his neck. In 2014, a Russian tourist was nearly killed by a needlefish in the waters outside Nha Trang, in Vietnam. The fish bit her neck and left pieces of its teeth inside her spinal cord, paralyzing her. In early January 2016, a 39-year old Indonesian woman from Palu, Central Sulawesi, was seriously injured when a half-metre-long needlefish jumped and pierced her just above the right eye. She was swimming in 80-cm-deep water in Tanjung Karang, a popular recreational spot in the Donggala Regency, Central Sulawesi. She died a few hours later despite efforts to save her at a local hospital. Shortly after, pictures of her injury spread through instant-messaging applications, while several local news websites also reported the incident, some erroneously attributing the attack to a marlin. In December 2018, a needlefish was responsible for the death of a Thai Navy special forces cadet.\n\nSome species of needlefish inhabit brackish and freshwater environments, and one of the freshwater species, \"Xenentodon cancila\" from Southeast Asia, is occasionally kept as an aquarium fish. It is a relatively small species, no more than 40 cm in length when fully grown, but is considered to be a rather delicate fish best suited to advanced aquarists.\n\nThe needlefish family is classified within the order Beloniformes and along with the sauries of the family Scomberesocidae they make up the superfamily Scomberesocoidea and in turn is one of two superfamilies in the suborder Exocoetoidei which comprises all of the Beloniformes except for the ricefishes of the family Adrianichthydae. Workers have concluded that the genus \"Belone\" is the sister group to the sauries and that if this is correct them the Belonidae is only monophyletic if the sauries are included within it.\n\n"}

It was released for MS-DOS in a somewhat unfinished state in 1993 by Strategic Simulations, and later patched to a more workable version. It was available on both floppy disk and CD-ROM, though the CD-ROM contained no additional content and was merely used to install the game to the computer's hard drive.\n\nIt was later re-released as part of the AD&D Masterpiece Collection in 1996. In addition, Data East was developing console ports for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation for release in 1996, but they were cancelled.\n\nThe game had a sequel, \"\", in 1994. An online MMORPG, \"\", was released in 1996 and hosted on the T.E.N. Network.\n\nThe game was re-released in 2015 on Gog.com with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\n\"Dark Sun: Shattered Lands\" takes place in the fictional land of Athas, a dying and hostile desert world. The locale is Draj, a city-state ruled by a powerful sorcerer-king. Nearby are several \"free cities\", surviving in the desert thanks to the hard work of their citizens. Upon the completion of the pyramid in Draj, the Sorcerer-King desires to make a great sacrifice of blood by sweeping the desert and destroying the inhabitants of the cities not under his control. The player controls a party of up to four gladiators, condemned to fight in Draj's arena until they die, so naturally the first order of business is escape. Upon escape, the party must unite the free cities to resist Draj's army.\n\n\"Dark Sun\" does not use SSI's older Gold Box engine. The game uses a top-down view of the world similar to the \"Ultima\" series. Much of the game involves interaction with other characters, giving the \"Dark Sun\" series more emphasis on role-playing and less on dungeon crawling than in the Gold Box games.\n\nThe game uses a variant of \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" 2nd Edition rules. As with other \"Dungeons & Dragons\" computer games, combat features prominently in the game play. \"Shattered Lands\" is noted for its highly strategic combat thanks to its two-dimensional turn-based combat system. No two battles are alike, and many of the \"boss battles\" involve a large army rather than a few powerful mages or fighters. Proper formation and spell use is a must, particularly when attacked from several directions. Characters are also far more powerful in Dark Sun than in ordinary \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaign settings: base stats are 4d4+4 rather than 3d6, and members of one race, half-giant, receive double to their hit die rolls. \"Shattered Lands\" also incorporates elements unique to the \"Dark Sun\" campaign setting, including unique character races (the Mul and the insectoid Thri-kreen) and extensive use of psionics.\n\nThis game was later included in the 1996 compilation set, the \"AD&D Masterpiece Collection\".\n\n\"Shattered Lands\" debuted at #17 on PC Data's computer games sales chart for the month of September 1993. It climbed to third place in October.\n\nWriting for \"CD-ROM Today\", T. Liam McDonald called \"Shattered Lands\" \"a refreshing new twist on familiar \"AD&D\" games\", and noted its \"vastly improved interface\" compared to SSI's previous products. Peter Olafson of \"Electronic Entertainment\" found \"Shattered Lands\" to be flawed, but he concluded that it was still \"a very good game\". He summarized, \"This isn't gold plate. This isn't tin. It's the real thing—with a bit of tarnish.\"\n\nScorpia of \"Computer Gaming World\" in 1993 assured readers that \"Dark Sun\" \"is about as far from [the Gold Box series] as you can get ... SSI is taking their role-playing line in a new direction, which is good to see\". While criticizing the \"inanity\" of the AD&D 2nd edition rules, and insufficient documentation, she concluded that \"my impression of \"Dark Sun\" is favorable. SSI is moving to a more mature form of CRPG [with] much promise for the future, and promises a good game to play right now\". The game was reviewed in 1994 in \"Dragon\" #205 by Sandy Petersen in the \"Eye of the Monitor\" column, who gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. John Terra of \"Computer Shopper\" mostly praised the game. He called the controls \"instinctive\" and \"easy to master\". He went on to compliment the audio and visuals, saying the graphics are \"extremely detailed\" and that the sound effects \"stand out, with various combat noises that enhance the atmosphere during melee\". He did have negative remarks about the map feature, noting that it does not automap and that it displays the positions of enemies, eliminating some of the suspense.\n\n\"Dark Sun\" was a runner-up for \"Computer Gaming World\"s Role-Playing Game of the Year award in June 1994, which ultimately went to \"Betrayal at Krondor\". The editors wrote that \"Dark Sun\" \"managed to capture the uniqueness of the magic system and 'scorched earth' look of Troy Denning's \"Prism Pentad\" series of novels\".\n\nAccording to GameSpy, \"Dark Sun was TSR's \"post-magical apocalypse\" world of brutality, blood, and incredibly violent death. \"Dark Sun: Shattered Lands\"' graphics, on the other hand, were rather cutesy—not the violent, mature affair fans were hoping for.\"\n"}
{"id": "1838820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838820", "title": "KMYS", "text": "KMYS\n\nKMYS, virtual channel 35 (UHF digital channel 32), is a CW-affiliated television station serving San Antonio, Texas, United States that is licensed to Kerrville. Owned by Deerfield Media, the station is operated under joint sales and shared services agreements (JSA/SSA) by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, making it sister to Sinclair's duopoly of NBC affiliate WOAI-TV (channel 4) and Fox affiliate KABB (channel 29), both licensed to San Antonio. The three stations share studios between Babcock Road and Sovereign Drive (off Loop 410) in northwest San Antonio; KMYS' transmitter is located in rural southeastern Bandera County (east-northeast of Lakehills). On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum and Grande Communications channel 7, and AT&T U-verse channel 35.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on November 6, 1985 as KRRT; it was the first English-language general entertainment independent station in the San Antonio market, as well as the first English-language commercial television station in San Antonio since KONO-TV (channel 12, now KSAT-TV) signed on in January 1957. Prior to the station's launch, San Antonio was the largest television market in the United States that did not have an independent station. Despite the large population of San Antonio proper (it had around 900,000 residents at the time the station signed on), San Antonio has always been a medium-sized market because the surrounding suburban and rural areas, then as now, were not much larger than San Antonio itself. San Antonio had been large enough to support an independent since at least the early 1970s. However, the market is a fairly large one geographically, and UHF stations do not carry very well across large areas. By the early 1980s, cable had gained enough penetration for a locally based independent to be viable.\n\nThe station was founded by the TVX Broadcast Group, and operated from studio facilities located in Loop 410, near Ingram Park Mall, on the northwest side of the city. Shortly before its sign-on, the station built a , guy-wired aerial transmitter near Lakehills to house its transmitter.\n\nAs part of a groupwide affiliation deal with TVX, KRRT became a charter affiliate of the Fox Broadcasting Company when the network launched on October 5, 1986. Paramount Pictures acquired a minority ownership interest in TVX in 1989; it would acquire the remaining interest in the company in 1991, changing its name to the Paramount Stations Group. At the time, KRRT was Paramount's smallest television station by market size.\n\nIn 1994, Paramount entered into a partnership with Chris-Craft Industries—which ironically owned NBC affiliate KMOL-TV (channel 4, now WOAI-TV) at the time—to create the United Paramount Network (UPN), with KRRT serving as the network's San Antonio affiliate; while Chris-Craft Industries was the sole owner of the network initially, Paramount supplied most of its programming (Paramount parent Viacom acquired a 50% interest in UPN in 1996). Subsequently, River City Broadcasting signed an affiliation agreement for independent station KABB (channel 29) to become the market's new Fox affiliate. On January 16, 1995, KRRT became a charter affiliate of UPN, with KABB assuming the Fox affiliation. Later that year, Paramount sold the station to Jet Broadcasting, which then entered into a local marketing agreement with River City. As part of the agreement, KABB took over KRRT's operations.\n\nThe arrangement was inherited by the Sinclair Broadcast Group following its acquisition of River City in 1996. Jet Broadcasting then sold the station to Glencairn, Ltd. (now Cunningham Broadcasting) in 1997. The family of Sinclair founder Julian Sinclair Smith owned 97% of Glencairn's stock (Glencairn was, in turn, to be paid with Sinclair stock for the purchases). For all intents and purposes, KABB and KRRT were a duopoly in violation of FCC rules of the period. Glencairn had owned eleven television stations nationwide that Sinclair operated under LMAs; a later plan to sell five of its stations to Sinclair outright prompted the Rainbow/PUSH coalition (headed by Jesse Jackson) to file challenges, citing concerns over a single company holding two broadcast licenses in one market and arguing that Glencairn passed itself off as a minority-owned company (its president, former Sinclair executive Edwin Edwards, is African American) when it was really an arm of Sinclair, and used the LMA to gain control of the station. KRRT moved its operations to KABB's studios on Babcock Road.\n\nOn July 21, 1997, Sinclair signed an affiliation agreement with The WB to switch the affiliations of KRRT and its four other UPN affiliates to the network. Prior to the agreement, San Antonio residents were only able to receive The WB's programming through cable and satellite from the national superstation feed of the network's Chicago affiliate WGN-TV. KRRT affiliated with The WB on January 25, 1998, rebranding as \"WB 35\", although it later branded itself verbally as \"San Antonio's WB\". As a result, KMOL-TV began carrying UPN programming during the overnight hours as a secondary affiliation; the network would not have a full-time affiliate or have its prime time programming air in pattern until Fredericksburg-licensed KBEJ (channel 2), which at that time served both Austin and San Antonio, signed on in August 2000.\n\nIn the following years, KRRT's syndicated programming inventory shifted away from sitcoms (such as \"Family Matters\", \"The Cosby Show\", \"Married... with Children\" and \"The Andy Griffith Show\") and movies, towards running more talk, reality and court shows (such as \"Judge Mills Lane\" and \"Judge Judy\"). It also gradually reduced cartoons from its schedule (including the Disney series \"\" and \"Doug\"), \"The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest\" and \"Pocket Dragon Adventures\". during the late 1990s, eventually limiting them mainly to the WB-provided programming block Kids' WB. After the FCC levied a $40,000 fine against Sinclair in 2001 for illegally controlling Glencairn, Sinclair purchased KRRT outright, creating the market's first television duopoly with KABB.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW. On February 22, 2006, News Corporation announced the launch of a new \"sixth\" network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television.\nKRRT was considered to be the likely candidate to become San Antonio's CW affiliate, since KBEJ had a rimshot signal that barely covered portions of the San Antonio and Austin metropolitan areas; most residents in both markets needed cable or satellite to get an acceptable signal from KBEJ. However, on March 2, 2006, Sinclair announced that most of its WB and UPN affiliates, including KRRT, would instead join MyNetworkTV; the CW affiliation ultimately went to channel 2—which changed its call letters to KCWX shortly afterward; this resulted in the station being dropped from Time Warner Cable's Austin system due to syndication exclusivity claims made by KNVA, which became that market's CW affiliate. To reflect the new affiliation, channel 35's call letters were changed to KMYS on June 19, 2006.\n\nIn September 2006, KABB stopped carrying Fox's children's program block, 4Kids TV; that station had carried the network's children's programming since the January 1995 affiliation swap with channel 35, it was moved to KMYS in order to accommodate the launch of a (short-lived) weekend expansion of its morning newscast \"Fox News First\". The lineup remained on KMYS until 4Kids TV was discontinued by Fox (due to a dispute between the network and the block's lessee 4Kids Entertainment) in December 2008, after which Fox permanently discontinued providing network-supplied children's programming. The infomercial block that replaced 4Kids TV, \"Weekend Marketplace\", was also rejected by KABB and likewise, airs instead on KMYS.\n\nOn February 12, 2010, Sinclair Broadcast Group signed an agreement with The CW to move its San Antonio affiliation from KCWX to KMYS; as a result, KMYS became the market's CW affiliate on August 30, with the MyNetworkTV affiliation moving to KCWX (ironically, the call letters of both stations continue to reference the affiliations they assumed in September 2006 following the respective shutdowns of The WB and UPN). This affiliation swap made KMYS the only television station in the United States to have been affiliated with all five of the major television networks that have debuted since 1986.\n\nKMYS retained \"Weekend Marketplace\" on Saturday mornings, but opted to air The CW4Kids/Toonzai over two shorter blocks with the first two hours airing from 3:00 to 5:00 a.m. on Sunday mornings and the last three hours of the block airing from 2:00 to 5:00 a.m. on Monday mornings. Toonzai was replaced by Vortexx on August 25, 2012; however, KMYS continued to air that block in those same timeslots. Likewise, Vortexx's successor, Litton Entertainment's \"One Magnificent Morning\", is carried in the same scheduling pattern (KMYS carries Litton's syndicated \"Go Time\" block as a weekday morning strip program in syndication, which features a 'best-of' selection of Litton's programming over the years, fulfilling the station's E/I programming requirements). As such, it is one of a handful of CW affiliates that does not air the network's children's program block in pattern, and one of the few stations in the country that air their affiliated network's children's programming at a time when the lineup's target audience would likely require the use of a DVR or the network's website to watch (WISN-TV in Milwaukee aired the non-E/I programming from ABC's now-defunct ABC Kids lineup on early Monday mornings before \"World News Now\" in 2005 before receiving network permission to drop it entirely). On October 9, 2017, the \"OMM\" block began airing on the station locally from 1:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m.\n\nOn July 19, 2012, Sinclair announced that it would sell the license assets of KMYS to Deerfield Media (which acts in a similar structure to Glencairn/Cunningham Broadcasting in its relationship with Sinclair), in order to comply with FCC duopoly regulations following its purchase of WOAI-TV from Newport Television. As WOAI and KABB respectively ranked at fourth and fifth place with KMYS ranking sixth overall in the San Antonio market in terms of sign-on to sign-off viewership, the formal creation of the new duopoly between WOAI and KABB and the sale of KMYS to Deerfield received Federal Communications Commission approval that November. The transactions were completed on December 3, 2012; however, Sinclair retained control of KMYS' operations through joint sales and shared services agreements.\n\nAlthough Sinclair controls all three stations, the operations of KMYS and KABB initially remained separate from that of WOAI-TV. Sinclair is in the process of moving certain WOAI operations from its longtime downtown studio on Navarro Street to a new building adjacent to KABB and KMYS' shared Babcock Road facility, which is expected to be finalized by the summer of 2014, with the news staffs of both stations fully operating out of a shared newsroom on the second floor of the main building.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKMYS is one of many CW affiliates owned and/or operated by Sinclair that transmits their main channel in the 720p high definition format, instead of The CW's default 1080i resolution format.\n\nKMYS carried MundoMax on its subchannel until May 2016. It started airing programming from the American Sports Network (forerunner to Stadium) at the start of June 2016.\n\nOn February 2, 2009, Sinclair told cable and satellite television providers via e-mail that regardless of the exact mandatory switchover date to digital-only broadcasting for full-power stations (which Congress rescheduled for June 12 days later), the station would shut down its analog signal on the original transition date of February 17, making KABB and KMYS the first television stations in the market to convert to digital-only broadcast transmissions.\n\nKMYS discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 35, on February 17, 2009, the original target date for full-power television stations in the United States to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which Congress had moved the previous month to June 12). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 32, using PSIP to display its virtual channel as its former analog channel 35.\n\nOutside of the aforementioned delay of The CW's \"One Magnificent Morning\" block to early Monday mornings, KMYS carries the entire CW programming schedule. Syndicated programs broadcast by KMYS include \"The Wendy Williams Show\", \"Maury\", \"TMZ on TV\", \"The People's Court\" and \"Jerry Springer\". The station also carries the local Latino-oriented music program \"Tejano y Mas\", which airs Saturday nights at 11:00 p.m.\n\nKMYS has also televised select San Antonio Spurs games since 1997.\n\nIn 1999, KABB began to produce a half-hour late afternoon newscast at 5:30 p.m. for KRRT. Titled \"WB 35 News at 5:30\", the program utilized the same anchors, meteorologist and sports staff as that seen on channel 29's 9:00 p.m. newscast. The program was cancelled in 2001 due to low ratings.\n\n"}

{"id": "1838840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838840", "title": "Radeon R200 series", "text": "Radeon R200 series\n\nThe R200 is the second generation of GPUs used in Radeon graphics cards and developed by ATI Technologies. This GPU features 3D acceleration based upon Microsoft Direct3D 8.1 and OpenGL 1.3, a major improvement in features and performance compared to the preceding Radeon R100 design. The GPU also includes 2D GUI acceleration, video acceleration, and multiple display outputs. \"R200\" refers to the development codename of the initially released GPU of the generation. It is the basis for a variety of other succeeding products.\n\nR200's 3D hardware consists of 4 pixel pipelines, each with 2 texture sampling units. It has 2 vertex shader units and a legacy Direct3D 7 TCL unit, marketed as \"Charisma Engine II\". It is ATI's first GPU with programmable pixel and vertex processors, called \"Pixel Tapestry II\" and compliant with Direct3D 8.1. R200 has advanced memory bandwidth saving and overdraw reduction hardware called \"HyperZ II\" that consists of occlusion culling (hierarchical Z), fast z-buffer clear, and z-buffer compression. The GPU is capable of dual display output (\"HydraVision\") and is equipped with a video decoding engine (\"Video Immersion II\") with adaptive hardware deinterlacing, temporal filtering, motion compensation, and iDCT.\n\nR200 introduced pixel shader version 1.4 (PS1.4), a significant enhancement to prior PS1.x specifications. Notable instructions include \"phase\", \"texcrd\", and \"texld\". The phase instruction allows a shader program to operate on two separate \"phases\" (2 passes through the hardware), effectively doubling the maximum number of texture addressing and arithmetic instructions, and potentially allowing the number of passes required for an effect to be reduced. This allows not only more complicated effects, but can also provide a speed boost by utilizing the hardware more efficiently. The \"texcrd\" instruction moves the texture coordinate values of a texture into the destination register, while the \"texld\" instruction will load the texture at the coordinates specified in the source register to the destination register.\n\nCompared to R100's 2x3 pixel pipeline architecture, R200's 4x2 design is more robust despite losing one texture unit per pipeline. Each pipeline can now address a total of 6 texture layers per pass. The chip achieves this by using a method known as 'loop-back'. Increasing the number of textures accessed per pass reduces the number of times the card is forced into multi-pass rendering.\n\nThe texture filtering capabilities of R200 are also improved over its predecessor. For anisotropic filtering, Radeon 8500 uses a technique similar to that used in R100, but improved with trilinear filtering and some other refinements. However, it is still highly angle-dependent and the driver sometimes forces bilinear filtering for speed. NVIDIA's GeForce4 Ti series offered a more accurate anisotropic implementation, but with a greater performance impact.\n\nR200 has ATI's first implementation of a hardware-accelerated tessellation engine (a.k.a. higher order surfaces), called Truform, which can automatically increase the geometric complexity of 3D models. The technology requires developer support and is not practical for all scenarios. It can undesirably round-out models. As a result of very limited adoption, ATI dropped TruForm support from its future hardware.\n\nRadeon 8500's biggest initial disappointment was its early driver releases. At launch, the card's performance was below expectations and it had numerous software flaws that caused problems with games. The chip's anti-aliasing support was only functional in Direct3D and was very slow. To dampen excitement for 8500, competitor nVidia released their Detonator4 driver package on the same day as most web sites previewed the Radeon 8500. nVidia's drivers were of better quality, and they also further boosted the GeForce3's performance.\n\nSeveral hardware review sites noted anomalies in actual game tests with the Radeon 8500. For example, ATI was detecting the executable \"Quake3.exe\" and forcing the texture filtering quality to a much lower level than normally produced by the card, presumably in order to improve performance. HardOCP was the first hardware review web site to bring the issue to the community, and proved its existence by renaming all instances of \"Quake\" in the executable to \"Quack.\" The result was improved image quality, but lower performance.\n\nHowever, even with the Detonator4 drivers, the Radeon 8500 was able to outperform the GeForce3 (which the 8500 was intended to compete against) and in some circumstances its faster revision, the Ti500, the higher clocked derivative Nvidia had rolled out in response to the R200 project. Later, driver updates helped to further close the performance gap between the 8500 and the Ti500, while the 8500 was also significantly less expensive and offered additional multimedia features such as dual-monitor support. Though the GeForce3 Ti200 did become the first DirectX 8.0 card to offer 128 MiB of video memory, instead of the common 64 MiB norm for high-end cards of the time, it turned out that the GeForce3's limitations prevented it from taking full advantage of it, while the Radeon 8500 was able to more successfully exploit that potential.\n\nIn early 2002, to compete with the cheaper GeForce3 Ti200 and GeForce4 MX 460, ATI launched the slower-clocked 8500 LE (later re-released as the 9100) which became popular with OEMs and enthusiasts due to its lower price, and overclockability to 8500 levels. Though the GeForce4 Ti4600 took the performance crown, it was a top line solution that was priced almost double that of the Radeon 8500 (MSRP of $350–399 versus US$199), so it didn't offer direct competition. With the delayed release of the potentially competitive GeForce4 Ti4200, plus ATI's initiative in rolling out 128 MiB versions of the 8500/LE kept the R200 line popular among the mid-high performance niche market. The greater features of the All-In-Wonder (AIW) Radeon 8500 DV and the AIW Radeon 8500 128 MB proved superior to Nvidia's Personal Cinema equivalents which used the faster GeForce 3 Ti500 and GeForce4 Ti4200.\n\nOver the years the dominant market position of GeForce 3/4 meant that not many games targeted the superior DX8.1 PS 1.4 feature level of the R200, but those that did could see significant performance gains over DX8, as certain operations could be processed in one instead of multiple passes. In these cases the Radeon 8500 may even compete with the newer GeForce4 series running a DX8 codepath. An example for such a game with multiple codepaths is Half-Life 2.\n\nRadeon 8500 came with support for TruForm, an early implementation of Tessellation.\n\nATI's first R200-based card was the \"Radeon 8500\", launched in October 2001. In early 2002, ATI launched the \"Radeon 8500 LE\" (re-released later as the \"Radeon 9100\"), an identical chip with a lower clock speed and slower memory. Whereas the full 8500 was clocked at 275 MHz core and 275 MHz RAM, the 8500LE was clocked more conservatively at 250 MHz for the core and 200 or 250 MHz for the RAM. Both video cards were first released in 64 MB DDR SDRAM configurations; the later 128 MB Radeon 8500 boards received a small performance boost resulting from a memory interleave mode.\n\nIn November 2001 was the release of the \"All-In-Wonder Radeon 8500 DV\", with 64 MB and a slower clock speed like the 8500 LE. In 2002, three 128 MB cards were rolled out, the Radeon 8500, 8500 LE, and the \"All-In-Wonder Radeon 8500 128 MB\", which was clocked at full 8500 speeds but had fewer video-related features than the AIW 8500 DV. ATI claimed that the lower clock speed for the 8500DV was due to the Firewire interface.\n\nIn late 2002, the \"Radeon 9100\" was announced to satisfy strong market demand for products based on the R200 architecture.\n\nAn updated chip, the \"Radeon 8500 XT\" (R250) was planned for a mid-2002 release, to compete against the GeForce4 Ti line, particularly the top line Ti4600 (which retailed for an MSRP of $350–399 USD). Prerelease information touted a 300 MHz core and RAM clock speed for the \"R250\" chip.\n\nA Radeon 8500 running at 300 MHz clock speeds would have hardly defeated the GeForce4 Ti4600, let alone a newer card from NVIDIA. At best it could have been a better performing mid-range solution than the lower-complexity Radeon 9000 (RV250, see below), but it would also have cost more to produce and would have been poorly suited to the Radeon 9000's dual laptop/desktop roles due to die size and power draw. Notably, overclockers found that Radeon 8500 and Radeon 9000 could not reliably overclock to 300 MHz without additional voltage, so undoubtedly R250 would have had similar issues because of its greater complexity and equivalent manufacturing technology, and this would have resulted in poor chip yields, and thus, higher costs.\n\nATI, perhaps mindful of what had happened to 3dfx when they took focus off their \"Rampage\" processor, abandoned the R250 refresh in favor of finishing off their next-generation DirectX 9.0 card which was released as the Radeon 9700. This proved to be a wise move, as it enabled ATI to take the lead in development for the first time instead of trailing NVIDIA. The new Radeon 9700 flagship, with its next-generation architecture giving it unprecedented features and performance, would have been superior to any R250 refresh, and it easily took the performance crown from the Ti4600.\n\nThe \"Radeon 9000\" (RV250) was launched alongside the Radeon 9700. The 9000 succeeded the Radeon 7500 (RV200) in the mainstream market segment, with the latter being moved to the budget segment. This chip was a significant redesign of R200 to reduce cost and power usage. Among hardware removed is one of the two texture units, the \"TruForm\" function, Hierarchical-Z, the DirectX 7 TCL unit and one of the two vertex shaders. In games, the Radeon 9000 performs similarly to the GeForce4 MX 440. Its main advantage over the MX 440 was that it had a full DirectX 8.1 vertex and pixel shader implementation. While the 9000 was not quite as fast as the 8500LE or the Nvidia GeForce3 Ti200, the 8500LE and Ti200 were to be discontinued, though the former was reintroduced due to strong market demand.\n\nA later revision of the 9000 was the \"Radeon 9200\" (RV280) released April 16, 2003, which aside from supporting AGP 8X, was identical. There was also a cheaper version, the \"9200SE\", which had a 20% lower clock speed and only had a 64-bit memory bus. Another board, called the \"Radeon 9250\" was launched in July 2004, being simply a slightly lower-clocked RV280.\n\nATI had re-branded its products in 2001, intending the 7xxx series to indicate DirectX 7.0 capabilities, 8xxx for DirectX 8.1, and so on. However, in naming the Radeon 9000/9200, which only had DirectX 8.1 rendering features, ATI advertised them as \"DirectX 9.0 compatible\" while the truly DirectX 9.0-spec Radeon 9700 was \"DirectX 9.0 compliant\".\n\nThe \"Mobility Radeon 9000\" was launched in early summer 2002 and was the first DirectX 8 laptop chip. It outperformed the DirectX 7-based nVidia GeForce 2 Go and was more feature-rich than the GeForce 4 Go.\n\nA \"Mobility Radeon 9200\" later followed as well, derived from the desktop 9200. The \"Mobility Radeon 9200\" was also used in many Apple laptops, including the Apple iBook G4.\n\nThe open source drivers from X.org/Mesa support almost all features provided by the R200 hardware. They are shipped by default on most BSDs and Linux systems. Newer ATI Catalyst drivers do not offer support for any R500 or older architecture product.\n\nThe PowerPC-based Mac mini and iBook G4, which run on Mac OS X, were supplied with Radeon 9200 GPUs; the final Power Mac G4 \"Mirrored Drive Door\" systems had the 9000 and 9000 Pro cards available as a BTO option.\n\nThis series of Radeon graphics cards is supported by AMD under Microsoft Windows operating systems including Windows XP (except x64), Windows 2000, Windows Me, and Windows 98. Other operating systems may have support in the form of a generic driver that lacks complete support for the hardware. Driver development for the R200 line ended with the Catalyst 6.11 drivers for Windows XP.\n\nThe Radeon 9250 was the final ATI card to officially support Mac OS 9.\n\nThe R200 series of Radeon graphics cards is supported by the Amiga operating system, Release 4 and higher. 2D graphics are fully supported by all cards in the family, with 3D acceleration support for the 9000, 9200, and 9250-series of cards.\n\nThe R200 series of Radeon graphics cards is supported by MorphOS\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838843", "title": "Apodemia mormo", "text": "Apodemia mormo\n\nApodemia mormo (Mormon metalmark) is a principally Nearctic butterfly in the family \"Riodinidae\". It is a particularly fascinating species for ecological and evolutionary research, as evidenced by its shifting taxonomic classifications. Conflicting observations of host plants utilized, distinctive morphologies, and a wide range of occupied habitats have prompted investigation into several potential subspecies. To date, two genetic studies have been done on \"A. mormo\", with analysis revealing that disjunct populations are genetically and phenotypically distinct. These studies support a potential need for refined taxonomies, although a larger body of data is required to make clear decisions.\n\nPopulations of \"A. mormo\" are widely distributed throughout western North America, with peripheral colonies located in Canada and Mexico. The Canadian populations have historically lacked scientific study, prompting a series of investigations in the past decade. \"A. mormo\" is the only representative of the family \"Riodinidae\", a primarily Neotropic family consisting of roughly 1500 species, that lives in Canada.\n\nThree populations of \"A. mormo\" have been given conservation statuses: the Saskatchewan population is listed as threatened, while both the British Columbia and Comstock Lange populations are classified as endangered. Conservation efforts are complicated by a dependency on human activity for habitat success. Soil disturbances, caused by human and railway traffic, are critical for the survival of host plants and subsequent \"A. mormo\" populations; however, overbearing human presence can lead to habitat destruction. Conservation statuses have been repeatedly defended by research, and recovery strategies developed in response.\n\n\"Apodemia mormo\" constitutes the widest ranging North American species of the family \"Riodinidae.\" Populations of \"A. mormo\" span western North America, ranging from Sinola, Mexico to Southwestern Canada, and are found west of North Dakota primarily in California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Washington. While there are several populations recognized in the US, only two are present in Canada: the British Columbia population, along the Similkameen River Valley, and the Saskatchewan population, in the Grasslands National Park. The Canadian populations are listed with conservation statuses of “endangered” and “threatened”, respectively. Rather than a continuous distribution, \"A. mormo\" colonies occur in semi-isolated patches. Population studies have found that small amounts of geographic distance between colonies (15–20 km) are significant to hinder gene flow, and render populations phenotypically distinct. Thus, there is great within species variation depending on geographic location, and taxonomic distinctions are still in flux.\n\nPopulations of \"Apodemia mormo\" primarily occupy dry, arid habitats that support a high density of their larval host plant: various species of buckwheat (\"Eriogonum). \"Since \"A. mormo\" is singularly dependent on \"Eriogonum\" during the larval stage, its presence is the most stable predictor of habitat.\" \"Dunes, sloping hillsides, grasslands and gravelly deserts have all been observed as viable environments for \"A. mormo\" habitats, indicating the species’ broad adaptability. Wick investigated microhabitat characteristics associated with \"A. mormo\" inhabitance, and found “host plant habitat[s] with lower elevation, a southerly to southwesterly aspect, lower available soil nitrogen, a steeper slope, higher % bare ground, and higher soil pH” were most often correlated with presence of \"A. mormo\".\n\nThe exact variety of buckwheat which functions as the larval host plant changes with the population being studied. \"E. paucifllorum\", commonly known as the branched umbrella plant, is closely associated with the Saskatchewan population. In British Columbia, \"Eriogonum niveum\" functions as the larval host plant, while in the population of \"A. m. langei\", \"Eriogonum nudum\" serves as the primary host and food source. \"A. mormo\" colonies have additionally been correlated with the presence of several other plants. In the Saskatchewan population, presence of \"Ericamerica nauseosa\" (rabbitbrush) is a good predictor of \"A. mormo\" presence, and functions as a secondary nectar source. Furthermore, Wick investigated the possibility of complex dependencies with other observed habitat plants, including “creeping juniper, yellow umbrella plant, saltbush, prickly pear cactus, Colorado rubberweed, yellow sweet clover, wild rose and sage”.\n\nSome level of human interaction with \"A. mormo\" habitats is thought to be crucial for their success. In the Canadian populations, specifically, human railway traffic through habitat corridors provides frequent disturbances to the soil, nurturing the growth of their larval host plant. To similar effect, steep and unstable slopes prone to frequent erosion provide appropriate conditions for host plant prosperity. \"A. mormo\" are rarely found on undisturbed flats.\n\nIn general, species of \"Eriogonum\" serve as larval host plants for \"A. mormo\". In the Saskatchewan population, \"Eriogonum niveum\", or snow buckwheat, functions as the primary host plant and food resource. In the British Columbia population, the branched umbrella plant \"Eriogonum pauciflorum\" solely fulfills this role. These species flourish with adequate soil disturbances, thus only those on rocky hillsides tend to bloom and attract \"A. mormo\".\n\n\"Eriogonum pauciflorum\" doubles as the primary nectar source for adult Mormon Metalmarks; however, rabbitbrush (\"Ericameria nauseosus\") is often used as a secondary nectar source. \"A. mormo\" preferentially visit branched umbrella plants, and have only been observed visiting rabbitbrush once \"Eriogonum pauciflorum\" flowers are in decay.\n\nDiffering observations have been made regarding the oviposition behavior of \"Apodemia mormo\". In California, Powell reports \"A. m. langei\" ovipositing on deteriorating, lower leaves of the \"Eriogonum\", typically in groups of 2-4 eggs. However, in the Canadian populations, Wick observes entirely different behavior. The specimens of \"A. mormo\" were seen laying eggs near their host plants, but not directly on the leaves. Instead, females oviposited a single egg in rocky crevices or soil cracks. This occurred in the afternoon, with a duration of up to 30 seconds. Temperature differentials between Southern California and Canada may help to explain these observed differences. Since exposure to sunlight supports increased survival in cold habitats, laying eggs on exposed rocky surfaces could be an adaptive advantage in the Canadian populations. Regardless, these populations still require ovipositing nearby suitably mature host plants, since the larvae will require adequate protection and nutrients once hatched.\n\nEggs are laid by adult females in clusters ranging from 1-4, depending on the specific population being observed. In Canadian populations, Scott reported the eggs as resembling “flattened spheres”, and described their color as “pink turning purple”. In contrast, Wick observed “amber coloured” eggs the size of a “pinhead” in the Saskatchewan population. Egg development is potentially dependent on habitat choice, temperature, and exposure to solar radiation; further studies are needed in regards to \"A. mormo\".\n\nLarvae emerge from eggs during the winter, and are thought to remain at a single host plant during this stage of their lives. Early instar larvae hibernate following their eclosion. From June to July, the late instar larvae feed nocturnally on the leaves of their host plants, which are various species of buckwheat, depending on the population under study. During the day, larvae can be found resting in nests made of leaf debris and silk at the base of the plant.\n\nPupation takes place by between July and August, with “hairy…mottled brown” pupas congregated in leaf litter underneath the host plant.\n\nAdult emergence occurs spread out over the course of a month, with males preceding females by a few days. These mature butterflies live between nine and twelve days, with females having a slightly longer lifespan than males. During this time, \"A. mormo\" prefer to stay near to their host plant, travelling short distances of up to 50 m. Again, there is a slight distinction between sexes, with females tending to fly farther than males. Both males and females forage for nectar.\n\nMating occurs approximately three days into the adult lifespan. Females seek out male partners, who wait on food plants for their arrival. It has been postulated that females of the subspecies \"Langei\" mate multiply, because of an observed ratio of 2.6 spermatophores per female.\n\n\"Trichogramma kaykai,\" a small parasitic wasp, parasitize \"Apodemia mormo deserti\", primarily located in the Mojave Desert. These wasps lay clutches of 3-5 offspring in each \"Apodemia mormo deserti\" egg.\n\nThe proper taxonomic classifications for \"Apodemia mormo\" are still under debate. Because the species tends to occur in small, isolated populations, the relatedness between populations is frequently questioned. A population genetics study conducted by Proshek revealed that the British Columbia and Saskatchewan populations of \"A. mormo\" in Canada are genetically distinct; furthermore, they uncovered higher genetic diversity in eastern vs. western populations, emphasizing low diversity in the British Columbia population. A second genetic study using AFLPs supports low genetic diversity in the British Columbia population, and reports high spatial genetic structure and limited gene flow between populations. Furthermore, they found genetic similarities between the Saskatchewan population and more eastern populations. The combined results of these two studies indicate potentials for current migration activities, as well as high genetic drift. In addition to genetic evidence, morphological and behavioral data are required to make firm taxonomic distinctions; however, genetic investigation has begun to reveal some of the challenges of classification.\n\nThere are at least twenty named subspecies of \"A. mormo.\" Below is a partial list of recognized subspecies:\n\n\"A. mormo\" populations exhibit significant morphological variation, and therefore no singular description is a perfect fit for the species. In general, the butterfly has a wingspan of 25–35 mm, with males being slightly smaller than females. Females are further differentiated from males by their number of functional legs; females possess three pairs, while males do not utilize their shortened forelegs and thus only have two. The Canadian populations have been described as having white checked dark brown wings, a gray body, green eyes, and black and white banded antennae. There is a reddish tint towards the base of the forewings, and the ventral side of the wings are gray.\n\nBoth the Canadian populations and the endangered \"A. m. langei\" are univoltine, meaning they have one generation annually. Following emergence, \"A. mormo\" adults have a flight period of roughly thirty days, with specific timing ranging from mid-July into September. They reach their highest concentration two weeks after the first adult emerges, usually during August. Adults do not fly long distances, and display mostly sedentary behaviors. The primary purposes for flight include foraging for nectar on nearby plants, and seeking out mates. Their flight pattern can be characterized as short, linear and fast.\n\nLow genetic diversity, small, distinctive populations, semi-isolated geographic distribution, and habitat dependence all predispose \"A. mormo\" to risk of extinction and warrant conservation efforts. In particular, Canadian populations are perceived as especially vulnerable to stochastic events, such as natural disasters, climate change, and outbreaks of disease. Conservation efforts have been in effect for the Canadian populations since the early 2000s under COSEWIC, and for \"A. m. langei\" since 1976 under the US Federal Endangered Species Act.\n\nA key concern for conservationists is potential habitat loss. Urban development, agricultural expansion, ranching practices, and campground activities may be responsible for disturbing natural habitats and breaking them up into small patches. While efforts to prevent such fragmentation are encouraged, Crawford emphasizes a need to conserve even small habitat zones, which may function as bridges between sub-populations. Furthermore, habitat loss might result from invasive, competitive plant species. \"A. mormo\" populations would severely suffer if these intruders successfully outcompete local \"Eriogonum\" species, given their dependency on the host plant. Finally, \"Eriogonum\" plants go into senescence after 10–15 years. This poses a significant problem for habitat maintenance, and suggests a need for regular dispersal of new \"Eriogonum\" plants as part of conservation efforts.\n\nRecovery strategies are consistently developed and updated as new research emerges. Regarding the Lange population in California, efforts to clear weedy vegetation and recreate mounds of sand and soil were started in 1991. \"Eriogonum\" species were seeded through the habitats and the land was completely fenced in, preventing destructive human presence. With respect to the Canadian populations, Crawford suggests the development of strategies which recover habitat patches, regardless of size, and encourage gene flow between isolated populations.\n\n"}

{"id": "1838876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838876", "title": "Culture of Malaysia", "text": "Culture of Malaysia\n\nThe culture of Malaysia draws on the varied cultures of the different people of Malaysia. The first people to live in the area were indigenous tribes that still remain; they were followed by the Malays, who moved there from mainland Asia in ancient times. Chinese and Indian cultural influences made their mark when trade began with those countries, and increased with immigration to Malaysia. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include Persian, Arabic, British. The many different ethnicities that currently exist in Malaysia have their own unique and distinctive cultural identities, with some crossover.\n\nArts and music have a long tradition in Malaysia, with Malay art dating back to the Malay sultanates. Traditional art was centred on fields such as carving, silversmithing, and weaving. Islamic taboos restricted artwork depicting humans until the mid-20th century. Performing arts and shadow puppet shows are popular, and often show Indian influences. Various influences can be seen in architecture, from individual cultures in Malaysia and from other countries. Large modern structures have been built, including the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers. Malaysian music has a variety of origins, and is largely based around percussion instruments. Much early Malaysian literature was based on Indian epics, which remained unchanged even as Malays converted to Islam; this has expanded in recent decades. English literature remained restricted to the higher class until the arrival of the printing press. Locally created Chinese and Indian literature appeared in the 19th century.\n\nCuisine is often divided along ethnic lines, but some dishes exist which have mixed foods from different ethnicities. Each major religious group has its major holy days declared as official holidays. Official holidays differ by state; the most widespread one is Merdeka day which celebrates the independence of Malaya. Although festivals often stem from a specific ethnic background, they are celebrated by all people in Malaysia. Traditional sports are popular in Malaysia, while it has become a powerhouse in international sports such as badminton. Malaysia hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1998, the first Commonwealth Games where the torch passed through more countries than England and the host.\n\nThe Malaysian government has taken the step of defining Malaysian Culture through the \"1971 National Culture Policy\", which defined what was considered official culture, basing it around Malay culture and integrating Islamic influences. This especially affected language; only Malay texts are considered official cultural texts. Government control over the media is strong, and most media outlets are related to the government in some way.\n\nMalaysia consists of two distinct geographical regions: Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia. Malaysia was formed when the Federation of Malaya merged with North Borneo (today the province of Sabah), Sarawak, and Singapore (seceded 1965) in 1963, and cultural differences between Peninsular and East Malaysia remain. During the formation of Malaysia, executive power was vested in the Perikatan (later the Barisan Nasional) coalition of three racially based political parties, namely the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), and Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC). UMNO has dominated the coalition from its inception. Although Islam is the official state religion, the Constitution of Malaysia guarantees freedom of religion.\n\nMalaysia is a multi–ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society, and the many ethnic groups in Malaysia maintain separate cultural identities. The society of Malaysia has been described as \"Asia in miniature\". The original culture of the area stemmed from its indigenous tribes, along with the Malays who moved there in ancient times. Substantial influence exists from the Chinese and Indian cultures, dating back to when trade with those countries began in the area. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include Persian, Arabic, and British. The structure of the government, along with the racial balance of power caused by the idea of a social contract, has resulted in little incentive for the cultural assimilation of ethnic minorities in Malaya and Malaysia. The government has historically made little distinction between \"Malay culture\" and \"Malaysian culture\".\n\nThe Malays, who account for over half the Malaysian population, play a dominant role politically and are included in a grouping identified as bumiputra. Their native language, Bahasa Malaysia, is the national language of the country. By definition of the Malaysian constitution, all Malays are Muslims. The Orang Asal, the earliest inhabitants of Malaya, formed only 0.5 percent of the total population in Malaysia in 2000, but represented a majority in East Malaysia, Borneo. In Sarawak and Sabah, most of the non-Muslim indigenous groups are classified as Dayaks, and they constitute about 40 percent of the population in the state. Many tribes have converted to Christianity. The 140,000 Orang Asli, or aboriginal peoples, comprise a number of different ethnic communities living in peninsular Malaysia.\nThe Chinese have been settling in Malaysia for many centuries, and form the second-largest ethnic group. The first Chinese to settle in the Straits Settlements, primarily in and around Malacca, gradually adopted elements of Malaysian culture and intermarried with the Malaysian community and with this, a new ethnic group called emerged, the \"Peranakan\" (\"Straits Chinese\"). These Chinese have adopted Malay traditions while maintaining elements of Chinese culture such as their largely Buddhist and Taoist religion. The more common Chinese varieties spoken in Peninsular Malaysia are Cantonese, Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, Hainanese, and Fuzhou.\n\nThe Indian community in Malaysia is the smallest of the three main ethnic groups, accounting for about 10 percent of the country's population. They speak a variety of South Asian languages. Tamils, Malayalees, and Telugu people make up over 85 percent of the people of Indian origin in the country. Indian immigrants to Malaysia brought with them the Hindu and Sikh cultures. This included temples and Gurdwaras, cuisine, and clothing. Hindu tradition remains strong in the Indian community of Malaysia. A community of Indians who have adopted Malay cultural practices also exists in Malacca. Though they remain Hindu, the Chitties speak Bahasa Malaysia and dress and act as Malays.\n\nSome Eurasians of mixed European and Malay descent live in Malaysia. A small community in Malacca are descendants of former Portuguese colonists who married Malay women. While they have adopted Malay culture, they speak their own language and are Catholics.\n\nEach ethnic group has its own underlying culture that separates it from the others, and they have achieved different levels of integration. The Chinese have integrated with Malay culture in a number of areas, including parts of Terengganu, and they form Malayanised groups such as the Baba Chinese in Malacca and the Sino-Kadazan of Sabah. Their years under combined British rule brought some joint sense of identity to all the ethnic groups, with English ideas and ideals providing some unifying features. A joint Malaysian culture can be seen in the symbiosis of the cultures of the people within it.\n\nThe Malaysian government defined Malaysian culture through the issuance of the \"1971 National Culture Policy\". It defines three principles as guidelines for Malaysian culture: that it is based on the cultures of indigenous people; that if elements from other cultures are judged suitable and reasonable they may be considered Malaysian culture; and that Islam will be an important part of national culture.\n\nSome cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring Indonesia. The two countries share a similar cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items. However, disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia's national anthem. Strong feelings exist in Indonesia about protecting that nation's national heritage. The rivalry between the two countries began during Konfrontasi just after Malaysian independence, when Indonesia and Malaysia were almost at war. Building resentment since then coupled with the economic success of Malaysia mean these feelings are still strong in Indonesia today. The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met to defuse some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture. Feelings are not as strong in Malaysia, where most recognise that many cultural values are shared.\n\nOne dispute, known as the Pendet controversy, began when Indonesians claimed the Pendet Dance was used in an official Malaysian tourism ad campaign, causing official protests. This dance, from Bali in Indonesia, was used only in a Discovery Channel ad, not an ad sponsored by the Malaysian government. Songs, such as the Rasa Sayange song, have caused similar controversies. The Malaysian national anthem, Negaraku, was claimed to be based on a similar Indonesian song written a year earlier. Both tunes are derived from a 19th century French song, which caused the similarity.\n\nIn 2019, plans by the Ministry of Education to introduce of khat (Jawi calligraphy) in the Year 4 Bahasa Melayu syllabus in vernacular schools in the following year became a polemical issue. Certain parties saw the issue as symptoms of creeping Islamisation while others saw it as beneficial towards the appreciation of a cultural heritage. \n\nTraditional Malaysian art is mainly centred on the crafts of carving, weaving, and silversmithing. Traditional art ranges from handwoven baskets from rural areas to the silverwork of the Malay courts. Common artworks included ornamental kris and beetle nut sets. Luxurious textiles known as \"Songket\" are made, as well as traditional patterned batik fabrics. Indigenous East Malaysians are known for their wooden masks. Malaysian art has expanded only recently, as before the 1950s Islamic taboos about drawing people and animals were strong. Textiles such as the batik, songket, Pua Kumbu, and tekat are used for decorations, often embroidered with a painting or pattern. Traditional jewelry was made from gold and silver adorned with gems, and, in East Malaysia, leather and beads were used to the same effect.\n\nEarthenware has been developed in many areas. The Labu Sayong is a gourd-shaped clay jar that holds water. Perak is famous for these. Also used to store water is the angular Terenang. The belanga is a clay bowl used to cook, with a wide base that allows heat to spread easily. Carved wood is used as ornamentation for many items, such as doors and window panels. Woodcarving was never an industry, but an art. Traditional woodcarvers spent years simply preparing the wood, due to a belief that woodcarvers need to be a perfect match with their wood. The wood also had to match the buyer, so woodcarving was a very ritualised task.\n\nEach ethnic group has distinct performing arts, with little overlap between them. Malay art shows some North Indian influence. A form of art called mak yong, incorporating dance and drama, remains strong in the Kelantan state. However, older Malayan-Thai performing arts such as mak yong have declined in popularity throughout the country due to their Hindu-Buddhist origin. Since the Islamisation period, the arts and tourism ministry have focused on newer dances of Portuguese, Middle Eastern, or Mughal origin. Malay traditional dances include joget melayu and zapin. In recent years, dikir barat has grown in popularity, and it is actively promoted by state governments as a cultural icon. Silat is another popular Malay martial art and dance form, believed to increase a person's spiritual strength. \"Wayang kulit\" (shadow puppet theatre) has been popular in Malaysia for centuries. The puppets are usually made with cow and buffalo skin, and are carved and painted by hand. Plays done with shadow puppets are often based on traditional stories, especially tales from the \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\". Traditionally, theatrical music is performed only by men. Javanese immigrants brought Kuda Kepang to Johor, and is a form of dance where dancers sit on mock horses and tells the tales of Islamic wars. The Chinese communities brought traditional lion dances and dragon dances with them, while Indians brought art forms such as Bharata Natyam and Bhangra. Colonialism also brought other art forms, such as the Portuguese Farapeira and Branyo. There are a variety of traditional dances, which often have very strong spiritual significance. Different tribes from west and east Malaysia have different dances.\n\nIn 2010, the Malaysian Art Culture was introduced to a new revival with the arrival of new independent galleries that focuses on the new contemporary young local artists. One of the most prominent key players in this new counter-culture is Minut Init Art Social in Uptown Damansara.\n\nArchitecture in Malaysia is a combination of many styles, from Islamic and Chinese styles to those brought by European colonists. Malay architecture has changed due to these influences. Houses in the north are similar to those in Thailand, while those in the south are similar to those in Java. New materials, such as glasses and nails, were brought in by Europeans, changing the architecture. Houses are built for tropical conditions, raised on stilts with high roofs and large windows, allowing air to flow through the house and cool it down. Wood has been the main building material for much of Malaysia's history; it is used for everything from the simple \"kampung\" to royal palaces. In Negeri Sembilan traditional houses are entirely free of nails. Besides wood, other common materials such as bamboo and leaves were used. The Istana Kenangan in Kuala Kangsar was built in 1926, and it the only Malay palace with bamboo walls. The Oral Asal of East Malaysia live in longhouses and water villages. Longhouses are elevated and on stilts, and can house 20 to 100 families. Water villages are also built on stilts, with houses connected with planks and most transport by boats.\n\nChinese architecture can be divided into two types, traditional and Baba Nyonya. Baba Nyonya households are made of colourful tiles and have large indoor courtyards. Indian architecture came with the Malaysian Indians, reflecting the architecture of southern India where most originated from. Some Sikh architecture was also imported. Malacca, which was a traditional centre of trade, has a large variety of building styles. Large wooden structures such as the Palace of Sultan Mansur Shah exist from early periods. Chinese influence can be seen in brightly decorated temples and terraced shop houses. The largest remaining Portuguese structure in Malacca is the A Famosa fort. Other colonial building include the Dutch Stadthuys, the Dutch Colonial town brick buildings, and buildings built by the British such as the Memorial Hall, which combines Baroque and Islamic architecture.\n\nThe shapes and sizes of houses differ from state to state. Common elements in Peninsular Malaysia include pitched roofs, verandahs, and high ceilings, raised on stilts for ventilation. The woodwork in the house is often intricately carved. The floors are at different levels depending on the function of the room. Mosques have traditionally been based on Javanese architecture. In modern times, the government has promoted different projects, from the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers, to a whole garden city, Putrajaya. Malaysian firms are developing skyscraper designs that are specifically for tropical climates.\n\nTraditional Malay music and performing arts appear to have originated in the Kelantan-Pattani region. The music is based around percussion instruments, the most important of which is the gendang (drum). There are at least 14 types of traditional drums. Drums and other traditional percussion instruments are often made from natural materials such as shells. Other instruments include the rebab (a bowed string instrument), the serunai (a double-reed oboe-like instrument), the seruling (flute), and trumpets. Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and at annual events such as the harvest. Music was once used as a form of long-distance communication. Traditional orchestra can be divided between two forms, the gamelan which plays melodies using gongs and string instruments, and the nobat which uses wind instruments to create more solemn music.\n\nIn East Malaysia, ensembles based around gongs such as agung and kulintang are commonly used in ceremonies such as funerals and weddings. These ensembles are also common in the southern Philippines, Kalimantan in Indonesia, and in Brunei. Chinese and Indian Malaysians have their own forms of music, and the indigenous tribes of Peninsula and East Malaysia have unique traditional instruments. In countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia it is believed that performing at the house during Hari Raya (a traditional malay festival) is a good belief as it brings goodluck and fortune to the performers and host of the house.\n\nWithin Malaysia, the largest performing arts venue is the Petronas Philharmonic Hall. The resident orchestra is the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra. Malay popular music is a combination of styles from all ethnicities in the country. The Malaysian government has taken steps to control what music is available in Malaysia; rap music has been criticised, heavy metal has been limited, and foreign bands must submit a recording of a recent concert before playing in Malaysia. It is believed that this music is a bad influence on youth.\n\nThe strong oral tradition that has existed since before the arrival of writing to what is now Malaysia continues today. These early works were heavily influenced by Indian epics. Oral literature such as folktales flourished even after printed works appeared. The Arabic Jawi script arrived with the coming of Islam to the peninsula in the late 15th century. At this point, stories which previously had given lessons in Hinduism and Buddhism were taken to have more universal meanings, with their main story lines remaining intact. Each of the Malay Sultanates created their own literary tradition influenced by preexisting oral stories and by the stories that came with Islam. The arrival of the printing press in Malaysia was key in allowing literature to be accessed by more than those rich enough to afford handwritten manuscripts. There was a division between the royal Malays, who knew English, and the lower classes, who only read Malay. In the early years of the 20th century, literature began to change to reflect the changing norms of Malaysians. In 1971 the government took the step of defining the literature of different languages. Literature written in Malay was called \"The National Literature of Malaysia\"; literature in other bumiputra languages was called \"regional literature\"; literature in other languages was called \"sectional literature\".\n\nMalay poetry is highly developed, and uses many forms. A \"Hikayat\" is a traditional narrative, and stories written in that fashion are named using Hikayat followed by the name(s) of the protagonist(s). The \"pantun\" is a form of poetry used in many aspects of Malay culture. The \"Syair\" is another form of narrative, once very popular. The Hikayat form remains popular, and the pantun has spread from Malay to other languages. Until the 19th century, literature produced in Malaysia focused mainly on tales of royalty, as it was produced just for royalty. It was after this point that it expanded to other areas. The race riots of 1969 strongly influenced literature; the improvements of the economy in the 1980s brought about social changes and new forms of literature.\n\nThe first Malay literature was in Arabic script. The earliest known Malay writing is on the Terengganu Inscription Stone, made in 1303. One of the more famous Malay works is the \"Sulalatus al-Salatin\", also known as the \"Sejarah Melayu\" (meaning \"The Malay Annals\"). It was originally recorded in the 15th century, although it has since been edited; the known version is from the 16th century. The \"Hikaya Rajit Pasai\", written in the 15th century, is another significant literary work. The \"Hikayat Hang Tuah\", or story of Hang Tuah, tells the story of Hang Tuah and his devotion to his Sultan. This is the most famous Hikayat; it drew from the \"Sejarah Melayu\". Both have been nominated as world heritage items under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 'Memory of the World' programme. Folktales such as the \"Hikayat Sang Kancil\", about a clever mouse deer, are popular, as are adventures such as \"Ramayana\", adapted from Indian epics. Munshi Abdullah (Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir), who lived from 1797 to 1854, is regarded as the father of Malay literature. \"Hikayat Abdullah\", his autobiography, is about everyday life at the time when British influence was spreading. Female Malay writers began becoming popular in the 1950s.\n\nDifferent ethnic and linguistic groups have produced works in their own languages. Chinese and Indian literature became common as the numbers of speakers increased in Malaysia, and locally produced works based in languages from those areas began to be produced in the 19th century. Beginning in the 1950s, Chinese literature expanded; homemade literature in Indian languages has failed to emerge. English has become a common literary language.\n\nMalaysia's cuisine reflects the multiethnic makeup of its population, and is defined by its diversity. Many cultures from Malaysia and the surrounding areas have greatly influenced Malaysian cuisine, with strong influence from Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cuisines. Much of this is due to Malaysia being a part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states of Malaysia have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.\n\nSometimes food not found in its original culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malaysian dishes. Food from one culture is sometimes cooked using styles taken from another. This means that although many Malaysian dishes originate from another culture, they have their own identities. Often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes; for example, Chinese food is often sweeter in Malaysian versions than the original. The Peranakans, Chinese who moved to Malaysia centuries ago, have their own unique cuisine that Chinese cooking techniques with Malay ingredients.\n\nDuring a dinner food is not served in courses, but all at once. Rice is popular in many Malaysian dishes. Chilli is commonly found in Malaysian dishes, although this does not make them spicy. Noodles are common. Pork is rarely used in Malaysia, because of the large Muslim population. Some celebrations have food associated with them, and mooncakes are often eaten during Mooncake Festival.\n\nAs of 2013 most Muslim Malaysian women wear the tudung, a type of hijab. This use of the tudung was uncommon prior to the 1979 Iranian revolution, and the places that had women in tudung tended to be rural areas. The usage of the tudung sharply increased after the 1970s. as religious conservatism among Malay people in both Malaysia and Singapore increased.\n\nSeveral members of the Kelantan ulama in the 1960s believed the hijab was not mandatory. By 2015 the Malaysian ulama believed this previous viewpoint was un-Islamic.\n\nBy 2015 Malaysia had a fashion industry related to the tudung. By 2015 Muslim Malay society had a negative reaction to Muslim women who do not wear tudung.\n\nNorhayati Kaprawi directed a 2011 documentary about the use of tudung in Malaysia, \"Siapa Aku?\" (\"Who am I?\"). It is in Malay, with English subtitles available.\n\nMalaysians observe a number of holidays and festivities throughout the year, on both the federal and state level. Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, but are not public holidays. The main holy days of each major religion are public holidays. The most widespread holiday is the \"Hari Merdeka\" (Independence Day), otherwise known as \"Merdeka\" (Freedom), on 31 August. It commemorates the independence of the Federation of Malaya. This, as well as Labour Day (1 May), the King's birthday (first Saturday of June), and some other festivals are major national public holidays. Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories. Malaysia Day, held on 16 September, commemorates the formation of Malaysia through the union of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak, although it is celebrated mainly in East Malaysia.\n\nNew Year's Day, Chinese New Year, and the start of the Islamic calendar are all public holidays. Muslim holidays are highly prominent in Malaysia. The most important of these is \"Hari Raya Puasa\" (also called \"Hari Raya Aidilfitri\"), which is the Malay translation of Eid al-Fitr. It is a festival honoured by Muslims worldwide marking the end of Ramadan, the fasting month. They also celebrate Hari Raya Haji (also called \"Hari Raya Aidiladha\", the translation of Eid ul-Adha), Awal Muharram (Islamic New Year) and Maulidur Rasul (Birthday of the Prophet).\n\nMalaysian Chinese typically hold the same festivals observed by Chinese around the world. Chinese New Year is the most prominent, lasting for 15 days. Hindus in Malaysia celebrate Deepavali, the festival of light, while Thaipusam is a celebration in which pilgrims from all over the country meet at the Batu Caves. Wesak (Malay for Vesak), the day of Buddha's birth, is a public holiday. Malaysia's Christian community observes most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas and Easter. Good Friday, however, is only a public holiday in the two Bornean states. The harvest festivals of Gawai in Sarawak and Kaamatan in Sabah are also important for East Malaysians.\n\nDespite most of the festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, festivities are often participated in by all Malaysians. One example of this is the celebration of \"Kongsi Raya\", which is celebrated when Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year coincide. The term \"Kongsi Raya\" (which means \"sharing the celebration\" in Malay) was coined because of the similarity between the word \"kongsi\" and the Chinese New Year greeting of \"Gong xi fa cai\". Similarly, the portmanteau \"Deepa Raya\" was coined when Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali coincided.\n\nA practice known as \"open house\" (\"rumah terbuka\") is common during the festivities, especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas. Open house means that all well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend. Open houses are normally held at the home of the host and foods are prepared by the host. There are also open houses held at larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations. Most Malaysians take the time off work or school to return to their hometowns to celebrate the festivities with their extended relatives. This practice is commonly known as \"balik kampung\" and usually causes traffic jams on most highways in the country.\n\nPopular sports in Malaysia include badminton, bowling, football, squash, and field hockey. Malaysia has small-scale traditional sports. Wau is a traditional form of kite-flying involving kites created with intricate designs. These kites can reach heights of nearly , and due to bamboo attachments create a humming sound when flown. Sepak takraw is a game in which a rattan ball is kept in the air without using hands. A traditional game played during the rice harvest season was throwing gasing, which are large tops weighing around , which are thrown by unfurling a rope and scooped off the ground while spinning. They are known to be able to spin for over an hour. Other sports are dragon dancing and dragon-boat racing. Malaysia's coastline is popular for scuba diving, sailing, and other water sports and activities. Whitewater rafting and trekking are also often done.\n\nMany international sports are highly popular in Malaysia. Badminton matches in Malaysia attract thousands of spectators, and Malaysia, along with Indonesia and China, has consistently held the Thomas Cup since 1949. Famous players include Lee Chong Wei. The Malaysian Lawn Bowls Federation (PLBM) was registered in 1997, and already fields a strong international team and has made progress on the international stage. Squash was brought to Malaysia by members of the British army, with the first competition being held in 1939. The Squash Racquets Association of Malaysia (SRAM) was created on 25 June 1972, and has had great success in Asian squash competitions. Football is popular in Malaysia, and Malaysia has proposed a Southeast Asian football league. Hockey is popular in Malaysia, with the Malaysian team ranked 14th in the world as of 2010. Malaysia hosted the third Hockey World Cup at the Merdeka Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, before also hosting the 10th cup. Malaysia has its own Formula One track, the Sepang International Circuit. It runs for , and held its first Grand Prix in 2000. Golf is growing in popularity, with many courses being built around the country.\nThe Federation of Malaya Olympic Council was formed in 1953, and received recognition by the International Olympic Committee in 1954. It first participated in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. The council was renamed the Olympic Council of Malaysia in 1964, and has participated in all but one Olympic games since the council was formed. The largest number of athletes sent to the Olympics was 57, to the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Malaysian athletes have won a total of four Olympic medals, all of which are in badminton. Malaysia has competed at the Commonwealth Games since 1950 as Malaya, and 1966 as Malaysia. It has been dominant in badminton, and hosted the games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. The 1998 Commonwealth Games were the first time the torch relay went through more nations than just England and the host country.\n\nMuch of the Malaysian media is tied to the ruling UMNO party, with the county's main newspaper owned by the government and political parties in the ruling coalition. Major opposition parties also have their own newspapers. Besides Malay newspapers, there is large circulation of English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies. The media has been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. There is a divide between the media in the two halves of Malaysia. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from East Malaysia, and often treats it as a colony of the Peninsular. Internet access is rare outside the main urban centres, and those of the lower classes have less access to non-government news sources.\n\nThe regulated freedom of the press has been criticised, and it has been claimed that the government threatens journalists with reduced employment opportunities and denial of family admittance to universities. The Malaysian government has previously tried to crack down on opposition papers before elections when the ruling party was unsure of its political situation. In 2007, a government agency issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders, a move condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party. Sabah, where only one tabloid is not independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia. Legislation such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act has been cited as curtailing freedom of expression. The Malaysian government has large control over the media due to this Act, which stipulates that a media organisation must have the government's permission to operate. However, the \"Bill of Guarantee of No Internet Censorship\" passed in the 1990s means that internet news is uncensored.\n\nMalaysian filming has gone through five stages. The first stage occurred when narrative filmmaking began in 1933, with the production of Laila Majnun by a company operating out of Singapore. For the first couple of decades following World War II, most films were directed by directors from India and the Philippines, which produced a second stage of movies. The first locally directed film, Permata di-Perlembahan, was produced in 1952. It however failed in the cinemas. A third stage appeared as Singapore-based studios began to produce films in the 1950s, but the industry was subsequently damaged due to independence of Singapore and the loss of studios there. Indonesian films gained popularity at this time, although a small group of filmmakers continued to produce in Malaysia, forming the fourth stage. In the 1980s the local industry began to recover, bringing about the fifth and most eloquent stage, which covered more themes than any previous stage. This was also the first time non-Malay films began to have a significant presence.\n\nThe government began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the National Film Development Corporation in 1981. Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's who want to develop films, however the criteria for obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent film movement has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which in the past two decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1838882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838882", "title": "The Storm Riders", "text": "The Storm Riders\n\nThe Storm Riders is a 1998 Hong Kong \"wuxia\" fantasy film based on the manhua series \"Fung Wan\" by artist Ma Wing-shing. Directed by Andrew Lau, it starred Ekin Cheng as Wind and Aaron Kwok as Cloud. The plot involves two children, Whispering Wind and Striding Cloud, who become powerful warriors under the evil Lord Conqueror's tutelage. The sequel to the film, titled \"The Storm Warriors\" and directed by the Pang brothers, was released in 2009.\n\nThe evil Lord Conqueror, head of Conqueror's Clan, is given a prophecy by Mud Buddha when quizzed about his delayed duel with Sword Saint. The prophecy translates that if Conqueror finds two young children by the name of Wind and Cloud he will have good fortune. Mud Buddha provides the birth charts of these two and gives him a puzzle box stating that finding Wind and Cloud is but one half of his destiny, the box will provide him with the latter half once he unlocks it. Conqueror issues an order that every boy with a birth chart matching Wind's or Cloud's must become a disciple of the Conqueror's Clan. Whispering Wind is discovered as the son of long time rival Whispering Prince, who Conqueror had beaten 2 years previously and stole Prince's wife. As they fight again for Prince's Blizzard Blade he reveals he only took his wife to anger him into battle to possess the blade. At the climax of the duel, Prince's wife kills herself and Prince is captured and killed by the fire beast in the nearby cave. Conqueror finds Whispering Wind has fainted and claims him. Striding Cloud's father, a blacksmith named Striding Sky, is forging the Ultimate Sword and completes the blade just before Conqueror's forces raze his village. As he is killed he reveals that the sword can only be used by using his own blood and Cloud is taken by the invading forces.\n\nTen years pass, and Wind and Cloud are now both fully grown and highly skilled martial artists, raised by Lord Conqueror with his daughter Charity and adopted son Frost. The 3 sons act as Generals in Lord Conqueror's army. Wind and Charity begin to form a relationship, but she is seduced by Cloud and secretly has an affair with him. Conqueror is angered by his inability to open the puzzle box, and the disappearance of Mud Buddha. He sends Frost and Wind to find him while Cloud is sent to claim the Unchallenged Sword and kill the clan leader, leading closer to completing his collection of powerful weapons in his Sword Graveyard. Cloud succeeds and Frost and Wind find Mud Buddha, now disfigured by boils as punishment from the Gods for revealing too much about the future to others. Later, Mud Buddha is taken by a masked fighter who easily repels both Frost and Wind. The captured Mud Buddha unlocks the puzzle for Conqueror and reveals that \"the dragon is powerful but will be stranded when wind and cloud become a storm\" therefore ending Conqueror's tyranny. Realizing it refers to Wind and Cloud and unwilling to accept his fate Conqueror plots to destroy them both.\n\nUpon realizing Cloud is interested in Charity, Conqueror decides to use her to marry Wind in hopes of Wind and Cloud killing each other. Cloud discovers the marriage and is quickly angered. On the day of the wedding Cloud abducts Charity. Conqueror tells Wind to fight for his wife if he is a man. Wind and Cloud engage in a battle and Lord Conqueror tries to kill Cloud in their duel, but Charity sacrifices herself to save him.\n\nAs Wind quietly grieves for his love, Cloud fights the Phoenix family for the Ice Vigor and uses it to preserve Charity's body, but is soon discovered by Conqueror. As they fight in a temple in the desert without water, Cloud's Palm style proves to be useless against Conqueror without any source of liquid at the area. Cloud rips off his arm and uses his own blood as a final resort to be used as source of liquid which is necessary for his palm style to unleash considerable amount of power to create an opening for escape. He is then discovered out cold by Muse and her father, Summit Yu. As they nurse him to health Yu discovers that the Fire Beast Arm he has trained to perfection rejects him and wishes to be bonded to Cloud and calls on specialists to bond his arm to Cloud.\n\nUnable to find Cloud, Conqueror moves onto destroying Wind, who he secretly poisons and sends on a mission to claim the Blood Bodhi fruit. As the poison takes its toll Wind remembers the truth about who killed his parents, and uses the Blood Bodhi fruit that grows in the cave to heal himself as well as make himself even stronger. He then defeats the fire beast who killed his father using the Blizzard Blade retrieved by his father's corpse. Cloud trains his new arm with the help of Muse's kindness before deciding to head back to Conqueror's kingdom.\n\nConqueror, believing himself free of the prophecy, challenges and defeats Sword Saint after the latter is distracted by Muse. Frost arrives and announces his discovery that it was Conqueror who kidnapped Mud Buddha and framed Wind and Cloud. Conqueror, now deluded into the belief he is invincible, kills Frost, who attempts to leave the clan. Soon afterwards, Wind and Cloud meet upon the steps to Conqueror's main hall and, united by their common enemy, confront Conqueror. As the fight spills over into the Sword Graveyard, Wind and Cloud are almost outmatched by Conqueror's superior sword skills. However, the blood from a cut on Cloud's arm reveals to him the location of Ultimate Sword (which Conqueror unknowingly had amongst the standard weapons littering the ground). With Striding Sky's sword in hand, Cloud rejoins Wind in the battle and Conqueror is soon beaten, with Wind stopping Cloud from landing the death blow so Conqueror is left insane and tormented by the ghosts of those he has killed, including his beloved Charity.\n\n\nEkin Cheng and Aaron Kwok returned for the sequel, reprising their respective roles as Wind and Cloud. The film was helmed by the Pang brothers and followed the \"Japanese Invasion\" story arc of the comics.\n\nThey were joined by newcomers to the franchise Hong Kong Cantopop stars Nicholas Tse, Charlene Choi, newcomer Tang Yan and veteran actor Simon Yam. Tse played the villain Heartless while Yam played his father, Lord Godless.\n\n\n"}

It is in Los Angeles that Tyler begins to comprehend advice that his mother gave him about loneliness.\n\nThe novel is about the generation after the X generation. The primary character, Tyler, is a \"Global Teen\", what was popularly labeled in the media as Generation Y. They are the children of the hippy generation, who \"react by loving corporations, and they don't mind wearing ties. To them, Ronald Reagan is emperor\". They exist in a globally connected world marked out by advertising and corporate power. They are optimistic when compared with their siblings in the X Generation. However, they do not have experience with leaders who show care for other people. \"I still remember Jimmy Carter. I still remember Pierre Trudeau. I still remember a time when society cared about other people. But there's nothing in these kids' databases to show that there are other options, that it wasn't always dog eat dog. Older people have to somehow convince young people that better things are possible.\"\n\nBeing released in the shadow of \"\", \"Shampoo Planet\" is considered another Zeitgeist catching novel. Its depiction of the Global Teen generation is similar to the depiction of Generation X in the previous novel, yet it suffers from comparison to \"Generation X\". Coupland himself has claimed that the novel is too contrived. However, the novel has retained its individual sense, and become a historical artifact of the times that brought about its creation.\n\nIt has been referenced by the show \"Ergo Proxy\", whose 21st episode was named after the book, and by the band Panic! at the Disco, in their songs \"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines\" and \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\".\nThe Japanese rock band Learners do a song called \"Shampoo Planet,\" written by Gakuji Matsuda.\n"}

By permitting each downloader to download only specific parts of the files listed in a torrent, it allows peers to start seeding more quickly. Peers attached to a seed with super-seeding enabled therefore distribute pieces of the torrent file much more readily before they have completed the download themselves.\n\nIn 2003, BitTornado became the first BitTorrent client to implement the algorithm.\n\nTesting by one group found that super seeding can help save an upload ratio of around 20%. It works best when the upload speed of the seed is greater than that of individual peers.\n\nSuper seeding transfers stall when there is only one downloading client. The seeders will not send more data until a second client receives the data. To avoid this, rTorrent continues to offer more pieces to the peers without waiting for confirmation, until it is uploading at its configured capacity. This improves the upload speed until enough peers have joined the swarm, at the cost of not being able to detect cheating peers, who engage in such anti-social actions as downloading only from seeds, downloading from the fastest peers, or advertising false pieces.\n\n\n"}

The plan was aborted when financial backing wavered due to the collapse of tin prices. The Yangon branch of the Tongmenghui took up the idea and started the \"Yan Kon Kwang Hwa Pao\". After a short run, the Rangoon paper was banned by the British colonial government due to its radical stance. Subsequently, the Rangoon Tongmenghui leader Zhuang Yin'an came to Penang and a committee was formed to revive the \"Kwang Hwa Pao\" as a daily paper.\n\nRenamed \"Kwong Wah Yit Poh\", the newspaper was first printed at and published from at 120 Armenian Street, the current address of the Penang Philomatic Union. The first premises of the \"Kwong Wah Yit Poh\" is now the Sun Yat Sen Museum Penang. The house where the \"Kwong Wah Yit Poh\" was founded has been preserved as the Sun Yat-sen Museum Penang.\n\n\"Kwong Wah Yit Poh\" is one of the oldest Chinese-language newspapers in Malaysia (\"Nanyang Siang Pau\" is the oldest national Chinese-language newspaper), outside of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as one of the world's oldest surviving Chinese newspaper (\"Ta Kung Pao\" is the oldest active Chinese-language newspaper in the world).

The six-storey building situated at the junction of Serangoon Road and Owen Road rapidly collapsed, trapping 50 people beneath the rubble. Seventeen people were rescued, whereas 33 people were killed.\n\nFrequently referred to as Hotel New World, the building in question was officially called the Lian Yak Building (). It was completed in 1971 and consisted of six stories and a basement garage. The Hotel New World, previously known as the New Serangoon Hotel until 1984, was the main tenant occupying the top four floors, and a branch of the Industrial & Commercial Bank (which merged with United Overseas Bank in 1987) took up the ground level. A nightclub, Universal Neptune Nite-Club and Restaurant, was situated on the second level of the building at the time of the collapse. The building had previously experienced a poisonous gas leak (caused by carbon monoxide) in some of the hotel rooms, first hitting the headlines on 30 August 1975, the day after the poisonous gas leak was reported.\n\nOn 15 March 1986, the building rapidly disintegrated in less than a minute at about , leaving little time for anyone within it to make their escape. Witnesses reported hearing an explosion prior to the collapse, but the police ruled out the possibility of a bomb attack. A gas explosion was thought to be a possible cause.\n\nThe collapse was met with shock by many, including the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew who was quoted as saying that \"the collapse of such a building is unprecedented.\"\n\nImmediately after the collapse, as many as 300 were feared trapped underneath the debris. Estimates dropped to 100 trapped or missing a day later, and then to 60, including 26 hotel staff and 16 bank staff unaccounted for. The figure was finally put at 33 when the official death toll was announced on 22 March 1986 after the end of the rescue effort. Amongst those killed, 23 were Singaporeans, and the other ten foreigners.\n\nAfter the collapse, many passers-by began to try pulling out survivors. They were soon joined by the Singapore Fire Service (SFS), the Police Task Force of the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). A nearby business, Eagle Piano Company, became a centre for the rescue operation.\n\nAs there were survivors buried in the rubble, the rescue was a delicate operation. Debris was carefully removed as power saws and drills cut through the rubble.\n\nSound detectors were used to locate survivors beneath the slabs by picking up faint moans and cries. In the first 12 hours, nine people were rescued. At one time, Lieutenant-Colonel Lim Meng Kin (SAF Chief Medical Officer), along with several other SAF medical officers and two doctors from the Health Ministry, took turns to crawl through narrow spaces inside the rubble in an effort to provide assistance to trapped survivors, giving glucose and saline drips to them.\n\nTunnelling experts from Britain, Ireland and Japan who were involved in nearby construction for the (Singapore) Mass Rapid Transit, including Thomas \"Tommy\" Gallagher, Thomas Mulleary, Norman Duke, Patrick \"PJ\" Gallagher, Michael Prendergast, Michael \"Mickey\" Scott, and Tan Jin Thong, offered to assist. They became concerned that the use of heavy machinery would collapse the rubble onto those trapped. Their voluntary efforts, digging 4 tunnels under the rubble, resulted in the rescue of another eight survivors. The tunnelling experts were later honoured by the Singapore government for their efforts. Thomas Mulleary was also nominated for an O.B.E for his rescue work but refused the prestigious honour when the rest of the rescue squad was not included.\n\nThe last survivor, 30-year-old Chua Kim Choo, was rescued on 18 March 1986, having survived after hiding beneath a table.\n\nFollowing the six-day rescue operation that ended on 21 March, 17 people were rescued, but 33 people lost their lives.\n\nMany potential causes of the accident were investigated. Surviving sections of concrete were tested to ensure they were built to proper construction standards and it was found that they were. The construction work of the underground railway – built by tunnellers who had assisted in the rescue – was investigated, even though the excavations were more than 100 yards from the collapsed building. It was found they had no effect on the building's stability.\n\nAlso investigated were the various additions made to the building after its initial construction. Air conditioning systems had been constructed on the roof of the building, the bank had added a large safe, and ceramic tiles had been fixed to the building's exterior, all adding considerably to the building's weight. It was found that the weight of these additions was inconsequential.\n\nHowever, this line of investigation into weight led to the discovery that the original structural engineer had made a serious error in calculating the building's structural load. The structural engineer had calculated the building's live load (the weight of the building's potential inhabitants, furniture, fixtures, and fittings) but the building's dead load (the weight of the building itself) was completely omitted from the calculation. This meant that the building as constructed could not support its own weight. Collapsing was only a matter of time. After three different supporting columns failed in the days before the disaster, the other columns—which took on the added weight no longer supported by the failed columns—could not support the building.\n\nAccording to Channel News Asia, Lian Yak Building was designed by an unqualified draftsman instead of a professional structural engineer. An investigator found that he had over-estimated the dead weight which the columns and walls could support. The draftsman claimed that the building owner Ng Khong Lim, who eventually died in the collapse incident, had appointed him to design Lian Yak Building but Ng directed that building work. The investigator also found that Ng requested to use inferior materials to build Lian Yak Building in order to reduce the cost.\n\nOn 27 April 1986, the Government of Singapore honoured five individuals for their assistance in rescue efforts, including three from Ireland, one from Britain, and a local. A dinner was also hosted by the Singapore government on 29 April 1986 for SMRT Corporation staff involved in the rescue effort, with the then Minister of Communications and Information, Yeo Ning Hong, as the Guest-of-Honour.\n\nFollowing this disaster, buildings built in the 1970s were checked for structural faults, and some of them were declared structurally unsound and had to be evacuated, including the main block of Hwa Chong Junior College and Catholic High School campus at Queen Street. The government also introduced tighter regulations on building construction; since 1989, all structural designs are required to be counter-checked by Accredited Checkers. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) underwent a significant upgrade, in terms of training and equipment, to improve its readiness in performing complex rescue operations.\n\nFive years after the collapse, construction work commenced on the site for a new seven-story hotel on 28 March 1991. The Fortuna Hotel opened with 85 rooms in 1994.\n\nIn July 1986, singer-songwriter Kelvin Tan contributed to \"BigO\" magazine's \"Nothing on the Radio\" cassette the song \"Seen the End\", after spending two nights at the former Hotel New World site.\n\nIn 1990, the disaster was re-enacted in the Chinese-language television series \"Finishing Line\" (出人头地), which was aired on SBC 8 (now MediaCorp Channel 8).\n\nOn 25 September 2003, the disaster was featured in the first episode of the second season of the television series \"True Courage\", which was broadcast on MediaCorp TV Channel 5 (now MediaCorp Channel 5). A Chinese-language version of the series, titled \"True Courage\" (逆境勇者), was also on aired on MediaCorp TV Channel 8 (now MediaCorp Channel 8).\n\nOn 27 September 2005, \"Seconds From Disaster\" portrayed the disaster in the episode \"Hotel Collapse Singapore\". Instead of the actual site, the program used an image of the area around 88 Syed Alwi Road (at the corner of Kampon Kapor Road) as the basis for a computer-generated reconstruction of the building and its collapse. The episode was retelecast in Singapore on 16 September 2007 via StarHub TV.\n\nIn February 2015, \"Days of Disasters\" also portrayed the disaster in the episode \"Hotel New World Collapse\". It was also featured in the drama \"\".\n\n\n"}

When it reached the sharp curve immediately before the station, the train derailed, colliding with the platforms.\n\nThe carriages, engine, and station buildings were severely damaged. The first carriage was crushed between the engine and the second carriage. The fourth carriage was knocked into the air causing it to drag along the station roof, damaging both the roof and the platforms to either side. Seventeen people, including the train crew, were killed and 25 injured.\n\nThe train had been diverted away from its usual route into Birmingham via Tamworth because of engineering work. The regular driver did not know the diversionary route via Sutton Coldfield, so another driver, fully conversant with it, had joined him at Burton-on-Trent to 'conduct' him over this section. However, the regular driver, complaining that the rough riding of the engine was tiring him, left the footplate and took a seat in the train, leaving the conductor driver in charge. This action was later criticised by the Inspecting Officer who commented that, even though he did not know the route, the safety of the train was still his responsibility.\n\nThe number of casualties was prevented from rising as a result of the actions of two local people who rushed up the railway line to stop a train heading towards the crash site. Two railway employees also raised the alarm to other stations, changed the signals to danger and placed detonators on the tracks to warn oncoming trains. One of the two had been injured and shocked by the accident, and both were rewarded with gold watches for their work.\n\nThe scene was attended to by a mobile surgical unit from Birmingham Accident Hospital as well as 40 additional ambulances from surrounding districts. Royal Air Force servicemen from Whitehouse Common provided aid to the emergency services.\n\nAlthough the excessive speed was the major factor in the accident, the exact cause was never fully established. The accident occurred in broad daylight and the driver knew the line well. There was no evidence of mechanical failure on the train. The driver and fireman died in the locomotive, so the reason for the excessive speed was never established. Investigators identified several factors that could have contributed to the excessive speed:\n\nIt seems therefore that the driver knew he was exceeding the speed limit but did not realise the extent of the danger (similar to the Salisbury rail crash of 1906).\n\nFollowing this accident, lineside speed restriction signs were universally adopted; previously there had been no visual reminder to the driver of speed restrictions on many routes. The Inspector also suggested the use of speed recorders, as in France, but this was not adopted.\n\nOn 23 January 2016, the 61st anniversary of the crash, a memorial to the victims was unveiled, at Sutton Coldfield station, by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Councillor Ray Hassall.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838943", "title": "M777 howitzer", "text": "M777 howitzer\n\nThe M777 howitzer is a towed 155 mm artillery piece. It succeeded the M198 howitzer in the United States Marine Corps and United States Army in 2005. The M777 is also used by the ground forces of Australia, Canada, India and Saudi Arabia. It made its combat debut in the War in Afghanistan.\n\nThe M777 is manufactured by BAE Systems' Global Combat Systems division. Prime contract management is based in Barrow-in-Furness in the United Kingdom as well as manufacture and assembly of the titanium structures and associated recoil components. Final integration and testing of the weapon is undertaken at BAE's facility in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.\n\nThe M777 began as the Ultralight Field Howitzer (UFH), developed by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering's (VSEL) Armaments Division in Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom. VSEL was bought by BAE Systems after the UFH prototypes had been manufactured and demonstrated, consequently BAE became responsible for future design refinements and re-named the gun 'M777'. Upon taking-over responsibility for the weapon BAE to a large degree 'americanised' the construction and assembly through its US-based BAE Systems Land and Armaments group. The M777 now uses about 70% US-built parts including the gun barrel manufactured at the Watervliet Arsenal.\n\nWith a weight of , the M777 is 41% lighter than the M198 howitzer it replaces. Much of the weight reduction is due to the extensive use of titanium. The M777 can be transported by helicopter sling-load, transporter aircraft such as the C-130, or towed by air-braked vehicles weighing over , such as the FMTV and MTVR. The minimal gun crew required is five, compared to a previous nine.\n\nThe M777 uses a digital fire-control system similar to that found on self-propelled howitzers such as the M109A6 Palladin to provide navigation, pointing and self-location, allowing it to be put into action quickly. The Canadian M777 in conjunction with the traditional \"glass and iron sights/mounts\" also uses a digital fire control system called the Digital Gun Management System (DGMS) produced by Leonardo MW with components of the Indirect Fire Control Software Suite (IFCSS) built by the Firepower team in the Canadian Army Land Software Engineering Centre. The Leonardo MW portion of the system, known as LINAPS, had been proven previously through earlier fielding on the British Army Royal Artillery's L118 Light Gun.\n\nThe Digital Fire Control System will be powered by a unique new design of rotary hybrid-electric engine designed and manufactured by Liquid Piston.\n\nThe M777 may be combined with the M982 Excalibur GPS-guided munition, which allows accurate fire at a range of up to . This almost doubles the area covered by a single battery to about . Testing at the Yuma Proving Ground by the US Army placed 13 of 14 Excalibur rounds, fired from up to , within of their target, suggesting a circular error probable of .\n\nIn June 2012, Golf Battery, 2nd Battalion, 11th Marines, out of Camp Pendleton, California, dropped the M982 Excalibur round on insurgents at a range of in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. This marked the longest operational shot in the history of the M777 howitzer, and the longest operational tube artillery shot in history for the Marine Corps.\n\nIn 2014 the US military began fielding several upgrades to its M777 howitzers including new liquid crystal display units, software updates, improved power systems, and muzzle sensors for onboard ballistic computing. Future upgrades include a touchscreen Chief Section Display, a new Mission System Computer, and a digital radio.\n\nIn May 2017, the US Army revealed it was buying the Swedish BONUS round as an interim system as a result of the required phasing out of cluster munitions from artillery shells, complying with policy to achieve less than 1% unexploded ordnance from non-unitary explosives; the BONUS has two sensor-fused munitions deployed by a 155 mm carrier projectile that scan the ground for targets and fire explosively formed penetrators down from the air. The system has been tested from the M777 howitzer.\n\n\nThe 18th Field Artillery Brigade (Airborne) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina was the initial Army test bed unit for the XM777 which included the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 321st Field Artillery Regiment. The initial prototypes were test by 1st Battations 377th Air Assault Regiment in 1998 also a unit of the 18th Field Artillery Brigade. 2nd Platoon, Bravo Battery, 2nd Battalion, 11th Field Artillery Regiment (2-11 FA) was the first US Army unit to fire the M777A in combat on 2008 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In June 2007, the M777 in its A2 configuration was assigned to the U.S. Army's 3-321 FA. It deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in December 2007 in January 2008 making the unit the first U.S. Army unit to utilise the M777 in combat in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In April 2008, the M777 was deployed for testing with 2-8 FA at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska. On 20 July 2008, at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, 1-108 FA, 28th Infantry Division, Pennsylvania National Guard, became the first field artillery unit of the National Guard to field and fire the M777. Two soldiers from 2-319 FA were killed from a breech explosion and other members of their gun crew were injured while attempting to fire a M777 at an ISIL mortar position in northern Iraq. Multiple firing incidents have occurred during training with the M777 including a fatal one in February 2014 with 3-321 FA and previously in 2011 with Marines from Camp Lejeune also at Fort Bragg.\n\nThe 3rd Cavalry Regiment deployed multiple M777A2 guns to Firebase Saham in Iraq on the border with Syria from 8 November 2018 to April 2019 to support the Syrian Democratic Forces in the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, the ultimately successful operation to capture the final town held by ISIL.\n\nIn May 2005, 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines, based at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, became the first Marine unit to begin fielding the new M777. 580 guns were supplied to the Marines, and 421 to the U.S. Army and National Guard.\n\nIn March 2016, 200 Marines and four M777A2 howitzers from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit set up Firebase Bell, officially the Karasoar Counterfire Complex, near the Iraqi town of Makhmour, supporting the Iraqi Army's Mosul offensive. The firebase was only from ISIL-controlled territory, and one Marine was killed in a rocket attack on 19 March, just days after arriving; direct attacks on the base dropped off in the following weeks as the Iraqis captured surrounding villages. The Marine howitzers fired every day in support of Iraqi maneuvers, using high explosive, smoke, and illumination rounds. They were relieved by Army soldiers after roughly 60 days, after firing more than 2,000 rounds in 486 fire missions.\n\nIn March 2017, the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit was deployed to Syria to provide artillery support with their M777s for forces seeking to eject ISIL forces from Raqqa.\n\nIn 2008, the Australian Defence Force made a US Foreign Military Sales request for 57 M777A2s worth an estimated US$248m. Subsequently, 35 guns were purchased for the Australian Army to re-equip the 1st Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, the 4th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery and the 8th/12th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery to replace 155 mm M198s and 105 mm L119 Hamels. The first deliveries of M777A2 began in late 2010. An additional 19 guns will be bought directly from American production lines to enable a total of six batteries. Concurrently, the Australian Army has acquired guided 155 mm munitions in the form of the M982 Excalibur and XM1156 Precision Guidance Kit.\n\nIn 2010, The Brazilian Navy evaluated the 155 mm M777 as a candidate to replace the six 155 mm M114A1 howitzers of the Marine Corps branch. The successor to the M114 has not yet been chosen.\n\nIn December 2005, 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, conducted an inaugural firing of its first 155 mm M777 towed howitzers, for a total of six guns. The six guns delivered were supplied by the United States Marine Corps under a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contract between the U.S. and Canada. The Canadian guns were first fired by A Battery, 1 RCHA at CFB Shilo and then were deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Archer, and were put into service in the Canadian theatre of operations around Kandahar in early 2006, this marked the first use of the M777 in Combat operations. In the summer they made a significant contribution during the Battle of Panjwaii when a small number of rounds were used to huge effect on Taliban elements retreating from the battle area. Many of the 72 reported killed during the heaviest period of fighting were due to artillery fire from only two of these guns. In late fall of 2006, the Canadian M777 Howitzers were equipped with the Digital Gun Management System (DGMS), which greatly improved accuracy and led to these guns being used for Short Range Close Support of Canadian and US ground forces. They proved so successful that an order for an additional six guns was placed with BAE. In May 2009, the Canadian government ordered a further 25 M777s, bringing the total to 37. The DGMS is also being improved with integrated communications.\n\nThe Indian Army first announced plans to acquire 145 guns for , but purchase plans were overtaken when the procurement process was restarted in July 2010. India's Ministry of Defence cleared the proposal for buying 145 guns for US$660 million on 11 May 2012 through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process. This was put up before the Ministry of Finance for clearance and will subsequently be taken up by the Cabinet Committee on Security for final approval. On 2 August 2013, India requested the sale of 145 M777 howitzers for US$885 million. On 24 February 2014 the purchase was again postponed. On 11 May 2014 the purchase was cleared by India's Defence ministry. On 11 July 2014, the Government of India announced that it would not order the guns because of cost issues. On 22 November 2014, the selection process was restarted under the \"Make In India\" program. On 13 May 2015, The defence ministry approved ₹2,900 crore to buy 145 M777 ultralight howitzers from the US. On 15 December 2015, the Indian Ministry of Defence said it was keen on placing a follow-up order of 500 more M777 guns.\n\nOn 26 June 2016, it was announced that 145 guns will be purchased by India for US$750 million. On 30 November 2016 Indian government completed the deal to buy 145 howitzers from the US. The deal was completed in December 2016. Under the agreement, BAE Systems supplied 25 ready-built howitzers, while 120 guns were manufactured in India by Mahindra Defence Systems Limited.\n\nThe Indian Army received its first shipment comprising two howitzers on 18 May 2017 in New Delhi from United States in ready to use condition. It was reported that on 2 September 2017, the barrel of one of the howitzers was damaged while firing during calibration trials. The Indian army used the M777 howitzer in the Himvijay exercise in Arunachal Pradesh which involved the newly raised integrated battle groups.\n\nA total of 7 artillery regiments are planned, each of 18 guns. The first regiment is planned to be raised by end-2020 with 15 guns supplied by BAE systems and three guns supplied by Mahindra Defense Systems Limited.\n\nIn 2011, Saudi Arabia ordered 36 M777A2 155 mm towed howitzers from the United States, along with 17,136 rounds of high explosive (HE) ammunition and 2,304 rounds of longer range rocket assisted projectiles (RAPs).\n\nThe Saudis purchased HMMWV vehicles to haul ammunition and carry the crews and their gear. However, they did not order any GPS-guided 155 mm Excalibur shells for their M777A2 guns.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Aviaries often contain plants and shrubbery to simulate a natural environment. \n\nLarge aviaries are often found in the setting of a zoological garden (for example, the London Zoo, the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and the San Diego Zoo). Spacious walk-in aviaries also exist in bird parks such as Jurong BirdPark in Singapore. Pittsburgh is home to the USA's National Aviary, perhaps the most prominent example in North America of an aviary not set inside a zoo. The Tracy Aviary is an example of a bird park within a public urban park, Liberty Park in Salt Lake City, Utah. Some smaller sized aviaries can often be found in European manorial gardens, such as Waddesdon Manor, UK, and Versailles, France. Some public aquaria, such as the Oregon Coast Aquarium, Newport, Oregon, or the Monterey Bay Aquarium, have aquatic aviaries.\n\nHome aviaries are popular with some bird fanciers who have the space for them. Many bird breeders list themselves as \"aviaries\", since most bird pairs breed best in aviaries in contrast to breeding \"cages\". Home aviaries may be built by the owner or obtained from a commercial supplier.\n\nThere are two main subcategories of home aviaries: grounded aviaries and suspended aviaries. Grounded aviaries are affixed to the ground with a concrete base to prevent rats and other vermin from entering. Suspended aviaries are suspended in the air with only the 'legs' of the aviaries affixed to the ground; hence, the need for a protective base is eliminated in suspended aviaries. Most grounded aviaries typically feature a woodwork or PVC frame unlike the metal frame of public aviaries; however, it isn't uncommon for suspended aviaries to feature a metal frame.\nAviaries are also used for research purposes in ornithology institutes\n\nAn aviary, a large cage to house and display birds, dates as far back and possibly earlier than the 1500s found in the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan as noted by Hernan Cortes when he and his men arrived in 1521. Also the \"Raven Cage\" (created in 1829), is regarded as one of the oldest structures in the London Zoo.\nThe first large aviary inside a zoological garden was established in 1880 in the setting of the Rotterdam Zoo. Aviaries were an important aspect for the many Rothschild houses that proliferated across Europe in the 19th century. This was a recalling of the aristocratic custom from the late 1600s, which involved the elite society displaying their power, status and wealth through the exhibition of exotic birds and animals. For instance, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild built his aviary in 1889 at Waddesdon Manor, UK, erected in the style of Versailles' trelliswork pavilions. \n\nIn 1902, a flying cage was completed in the setting of the National Zoological Park of the Smithsonian Institution. A new \"Great Flying Cage\" was built in 1964.\n\nThe Saint Louis Zoo is home to the 1904 World's Fair Flight Cage. It is one of only two permanent structures built for the World's Fair which still remain (the other is the Saint Louis Art Museum's Cass Gilbert building). In 1904, it was the largest bird cage ever built. It remains one of the world's largest free-flight aviaries. The long, wide, and high cage was built by the Smithsonian Institution specifically for the St. Louis World's Fair. Local pride in the giant cage motivated St. Louis to finally establish a zoo in 1910.\n\nIn 1937, the San Diego Zoo's aviary designed by architect Louis John Gill opened; it was then the largest in the world. The mammoth steel structure, long, wide and more than high, funded by the Works Progress Administration at a cost of $50,000, had no beams, cross or guy-wires to impede the flight of the birds.\n\nWith the Antwerp cage system (1948), birds are only separate from public with a light system used indoor the \"Bird Building\" at Antwerp Zoo.\n\nAt the Frankfurt Zoo, the bird house was built in 1969. Its \"Bird Halls\" presented birds for the first time in large glassed miniature habitats. In diving exhibits, darters and kingfishers could be seen hunting under water, and in the free-flight hall visitors still walk amongst tropical birds in dense vegetation.\nIn 1963, the same principle was used outdoors to construct the \"Bird Thicket\", ten aviaries surrounded by dense bushes and designed in various habitat settings, which visitors can enter through wire netted doors and curtains of cords.\n\nThe \"Snowdon Aviary\" in London Zoo was designed by Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, Cedric Price and Frank Newby, and built in 1962–1964.\n\nThe Bronx Zoo's \"World of Birds\", a two-story bird house completed in 1972, is a huge, landscaped, indoor free-flight exhibit. The one-way flow pattern in the exhibit moves the visitors through twenty-five birds habitats, ranging from desert to tropical forest. Each setting recreates with impressive fidelity the microculture of the birds that fly merrily about within their diorama world, complete with living plants. Five of the aviaries are completely open: in two of the largest the uncaged public walks through the habitat with birds freely overhead.\n\nThe Henry Doorly Zoo's \"Simmons Aviary\" opened in 1983 and is one of the world's largest free-flight aviaries. About 500 birds from all parts of the world occupy the area of the aviary. In this exhibit, visitors see flamingos, ducks, swans, storks, cranes, spoonbills, ibis and egrets. The Aviary is long and rises to at the center. The structure of two-inch nylon mesh is supported by a system of cables and poles. The use of nylon instead of wire is a unique concept.\n\nBirds of Eden bird sanctuary, located in the Western Cape of South Africa, is possibly the largest free flight aviary in the world. The aviary opened in 2005 and covers an area of with a total volume of . It is home to around 3,000 individual birds from 200 species.\n\n\n"}

Some of the approximately 3,000 members have planned various acts of violence, often directed at rival factions. Two Al-Fuqra members were convicted of conspiring to murder Rashad Khalifa in 1990, and others are alleged to have assassinated Ahmadiyya leader Mozaffar Ahmad in 1983.\n\nIt has been alleged that the groups Muslims of the Americas and Quranic Open University are the same as Jamaat ul-Fuqra, but this has not been confirmed. These allegations are primarily made by far-right organizations, many who believe the organizations are operating terrorist training camps in the United States. Muslims of America denies any connection. \n\nThe group is separatist, and was described by the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT) and a similar profile in the database of the South Asian Terror Portal as a cult.\n\nAlthough various members have been suspected of assassinations and other acts of terror perpetrated in the 1980s and later, and some members having been charged with conspiracy to commit first degree murder and other crimes, ul-Fuqra itself is not listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US or the EU. It was included in a list of terrorist organizations in \"Patterns of Global Terrorism\", a 1999 report by the U.S. State Department.\n\nThe group has been banned in Pakistan. Jamaat ul-Fuqra was also involved in the planned bombing of a Hindu temple in Toronto, Canada in 1991.\n\nOn July 29, 1983, Stephen Paul Paster, an ul-Fuqra member, set off a bomb at the Hotel Rajneesh, a hotel in Portland, Oregon, United States. The hotel was owned by the Rajneesh religious group and featured the Zorba the Buddha nightclub. Paster had several bombs and homemade napalm in his room, but one of the bombs went off in his hands while he was placing the bombs in the midst of the napalm.\n\nPaster was almost immediately arrested after the bombs went off, as he was one of only two people injured in the explosion, which took place at 1:23 a.m. After the hotel was evacuated two other explosions occurred at 3 a.m. Paster was charged with arson due to the fire which resulted from the explosions. Paster posted $20,000 bail, but fled Oregon and was not apprehended until June 1984 in Englewood, Colorado. In November 1985, Paster was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a Multnomah County circuit judge.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838957", "title": "My All", "text": "My All\n\n\"My All\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey from her sixth studio album, \"Butterfly\" (1997). It was released as the album's fifth single overall and second commercial single on April 21, 1998 by Columbia Records. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. \"My All\" is built around Latin guitar chord melodies, and makes subtle use of Latin percussion throughout the first chorus, before taking on a more conventional contemporary R&B-style beat. Carey was inspired to write the song and use Latin inspired melodies after her trip to Puerto Rico, where she was influenced by the culture. The song's lyrics tell of a lonely woman declaring she would give \"her all\" to have just one more night with her estranged lover. It is the first song she wrote for the \"Butterfly\" album.\"\n\nThe music video for the song was released in March 1998. It shows many scenes of Carey laying on a submerged vessel in a large body of water, while lamenting her lost lover. Towards the video's climax, Carey and her love interest climb atop a lighthouse and caress each other under the night's sky. \"My All\" was performed live on various occasions, including the 1998 World Music Awards and Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, \"Saturday Night Live\", \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\" and various European television and music chart programs. The song was also part of Carey's 1998 Butterfly World Tour, and was performed during many future tours and concerts. House music producer David Morales remixed the song, which was performed live as a medley with the original.\n\n\"My All\" was well received by contemporary music critics and charted strongly throughout various music markets. In the United States, the song became Carey's thirteenth chart topper on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Throughout Europe, the song performed moderately, peaking at number four in the United Kingdom and in the top ten in Belgium (Wallonia), France, Spain and Switzerland. In France, due to strong sales, the song was certified silver by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP).\n\nCarey began writing and composing themes for \"Butterfly\" by the end of 1996. She considered this period in time a \"redefining moment for herself,\" where she began writing and recording the music she truly loved, Contemporary R&B and hip hop. Additionally, Carey began incorporating other genres of music into her song-writing, assisting her in developing new ideas and melodies. Carey expressed how the mixed emotions she felt at that point in her life helped develop the song, as she would \"pour herself and emotions into anything she was writing at the time.\" In an interview with Fred Bronson, Carey expressed how her visit to Puerto Rico and the current emotions in her life inspired her to write \"My All\":\n\nI had gone to Puerto Rico and was influenced by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy point in my life and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why think a lot of people felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.\n\nCarey began to infuse her personality into her work, something that showed throughout various tracks. During her stay, she was influenced by the Latin culture, and began harmonizing and singing the music she heard there. When she arrived back to New York, she already had the melody developed, and soon began working on the song in San Francisco with Afanasieff.\n\nCarey and Afanasieff had worked together since her debut release in 1990. Together, they had written most of Carey's biggest hits at the time, including \"Hero\" and \"One Sweet Day.\" \"My All\" would be the last time the two would collaborate, as he is absent from the writing credits in her follow-up album, \"Rainbow\" (1999). During the recording of the song, Carey and then husband Tommy Mottola were in the midst of their divorce. Afanasieff, who had developed relationships with the two of them, was caught in the middle. He spoke of the difficulties he had recording \"My All\" with Carey, as their relationship had already strained during the divorce. Afanasieff had been employed by Mottola and Columbia Records, and had worked extensively with Carey in the studio. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Afanasieff spoke in depth of the personal problems he experienced with Carey in 1997:\n\nI needed to maintain a very strong relationship with Tommy [Mottola]. During that period, the beginning of their end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.\n\n\"My All\" was written in Carey's home-studio in upstate New York, and was recorded in Afanasieff's recording studio in San Francisco. After she presented him with the melody she had developed in Puerto Rico, he began playing chords on the piano, while Carey sang the tune and directed him. After they produced the chorus, Carey wrote the lyrics, while he added a drum groove to the basic melody. According to Afanasieff, \"My All\" had tapped into both their Latin backgrounds. While she hadn't spent much time with her Venezuelan paternal grandfather, Carey said the music was \"definitely subconsciously in me.\" On the other hand, Afanasieff was born in Brazil, and had heard Russian and Brazilian music his whole life. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Afanasieff described the steps they took to record the song:\n\nI remember being in the back part of the studio, and we were sitting there late at night and writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down and it was one of the easier songs to write with her.\n\n\"My All\" is a slow-tempo ballad, that blends contemporary R&B beats and Latin guitar and chord melodies, making subtle use of Latin percussion in the first chorus. The song is described as having a \"lush sound\" and featured synthetic guitar arpeggios that were produced in the studio. \"My All\" was compared to Toni Braxton's music style, described as \"slink, slow-jam R&B sounds.\" The song is set in the signature common time, and is written in the key of G minor. It features a basic chord progression of Gm-Cm-D7-Gm. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B to the high note of F, with the piano and guitar pieces range from G3 to G5. The track was very different than anything Carey had ever recorded, incorporating strong \"Latin cultured background.\" The instrumentation and vocal arrangement used in the song was compared to Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds' productions, due to its \"soft R&B coos and guitar melodies.\"\n\n\"My All\" garnered critical acclaim from contemporary music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic chose the song as one of the three \"track choices\" from the album. Daryl Easlea for BBC said it \"encapsulates her more traditional, straight ballad approach with Latin overtones.\" Larry Flick from \"Billboard\" praised the song, calling it an \"anthemic gem.\" Flick also described the song as \"sparkling with a house flavor that's mildly reminiscent of Toni Braxton's landmark 'Un-break My Heart'.\" While reviewing the album, Flick also reviewed the Morales remix, writing \"Morales straddles the fence between underground aggression and pop-radio fluff with deceptive ease, crafting a track anchored with a muscular bassline and embellished with vibrant synths. It's 10 minutes of pure disco bliss.\" David Browne from \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised the song's instrumentation, noting \"with its gently plucked guitars, is the best Babyface track Babyface never produced.\" In 2018 the magazine described it as a \"let-the-candles-burn\" ballad \"put through a slow-burn flamenco filter and zhuzhed up with some serious sensuality and Spanish guitar.\" \"The Hartford Courant\" wrote that Carey's voice \"flows like molasses, accompanied by a lead guitar in the sexy \"My All\".\" \"Virginian Pilot\" described the song as a \"lush pop ballad\" that has been \"tailor-made\" for Carey. \n\nAlthough \"My All\" was the fifth single released from \"Butterfly\", it was only the second commercial worldwide release. The song debuted at number 2 behind Next's Too Close and eventually became Carey's 13th chart topper in the United States, placing her in fourth place for most number ones in the US. Also, it gave Carey the honor of having the most number ones for a female artist. It stayed atop the Hot 100 for one week, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over one million units. \"My All\" peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and eighteen on the Adult Contemporary chart. It finished number seventeen on the \"Billboard\" end of year chart, and ninety-nine on the end of decade chart. In Canada, the song entered the Canadian \"RPM\" Chart at number 89 during the week of May 18, 1998. In its fifth week, the song peaked at number 28, spending 16 weeks in the chart before exiting the week of August 31.\n\n\"My All\" performed weakly in Australia, peaking at number 39 while spending only two weeks on the ARIA Top-40. In Belgium (Wallonia), it peaked at number nine, and spent 14 weeks on the Ultratop singles chart. The song performed well in France, peaking at number six and spending 24 weeks fluctuating in the French singles chart. \"My All\" was certified silver by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), denoting shipments of over 200,000 units throughout France. The song performed moderately in Ireland, peaking at number 21, and spending seven weeks on the Irish Singles Chart. In Norway and Sweden, it peaked at numbers 14 and 15, respectively. The song charted well in Switzerland, spending 21 weeks in the top-100, and peaking at number seven. In the United Kingdom, 'My All\" debuted and peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart during the week of June 13, 1998. The song spent eight weeks fluctuating in the singles chart, until the week of August 1, 1998 where it dropped outside the top-100. Sales in the UK are estimated at 160,000 units.\n\n\"My All\" features two remixes: the first is a contemporary R&B version titled, \"My All/Stay Awhile\" (So So Def Remix). Carey re-recorded her vocals for the song, while building it around a sample from the Loose Ends song \"Stay a Little While, Child.\" Carey's vocal interpolation blends the first verse and chorus of \"My All\" with the verse and chorus of \"Stay a Little While, Child.\" It was produced by Jermaine Dupri and features raps from Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz. The single also features a version without any rap verses. The second remix is a dance version mixed by David Morales. The dance remix is known as the Classic Club Mix; it was Carey's first collaboration with Morales that did not feature entirely new vocals. Consequently, the song is fairly close to the original chord progressions of the album version, though some new vocals were added. The remix was performed live as a medley with the original during many of Carey's live concert tours.\n\nCarey recorded a Spanish version of \"My All\" titled, \"Mi Todo.\" Unlike with \"Hero\" (1993) and \"Open Arms\" (1995), Carey recorded the Spanish version of the song in a different key from the original English version. The first line of the song had been mistranslated and was grammatically incorrect. Carey later mentioned on her website that she would no longer record Spanish versions of her songs until she could verify the correct lyrics and pronunciation. \"Mi Todo\" was remixed as well, however only being released as a promotional single in Mexico.\n\n\"My All\" and the \"My All/Stay Awhile\" (So So Def Remix) featured different music videos. The video for \"My All\" was shot entirely in black and white in Puerto Rico, and was directed by fashion photographer Herb Ritts. The video begins with Carey lying on an overturned vessel on a beach, staring into the night sky, lamenting her estranged lover. As the scenes progress, Carey's love interest is seen atop a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean, searching for his lost companion. Further scenes show Carey laying on a large conch shell, wet and vulnerable. Soon after, she begins walking on a path of large white flowers, until she reaches the top of the lighthouse where she is rejoined with her lover. After the song's second verse, Carey and the man begin caressing each other, and embracing atop the lighthouse. After they share an intimate moment, Carey is shown walking back on the trail of white flowers, smiling and happy. The scenes of Carey lying in the shell and in front of the flowers were inspired by Sandro Botticelli's painting \"The Birth of Venus\". According to author Chris Nickson, the snippets of Carey on the overturned vessel showed her vulnerability without her loved one, truly highlighting the yearning emphasized in the song.\n\nA music video was also filmed for the So So Def remix. Directed by Diane Martel, it was shot in a grainy fashion to simulate a home video. The video features cameo appearances by Dupri, Tariq and Gunz. It begins with scenes of Carey and Dupri at a small in-home gathering, lounging and enjoying each other's company. As the video progresses, the other two featured hip-hop musicians appear at the house, alongside various other guests. They begin to dance to music, while sipping on cocktails by the pool. As the video reaches its climax, scenes of Carey singing in an outdoor garden are shown, while the others join her on the pool deck.\n\n\"My All\" was performed on several live television appearances, as well as most of Carey's tours following the song's release. Carey first sang \"My All\" on Saturday Night Live on November 15, 1997. The performance featured guitar player. Later, Carey performed the song at the 1998 World Music Awards, completing both the original and dance remix as a medley. The performance was via-satellite from Carey's tour at the time, which was broadcast onto a large screen. At the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards in 1998, Carey sang the original version of the song, featuring a full orchestra and live backup vocals.\n\nCarey was one of the five featured performers at the 1998 VH1 Divas, where she sang \"My All\" as well as the dance remix. The song was performed on the British music chart program, \"Top of the Pops\", where a live medley of the original and dance versions were performed. \"My All\" was performed during Carey's Butterfly World Tour in 1998. For the performances in Japan, Carey featured a Latin guitarist and backing vocals. The guitarist was present during the song's recital throughout the entire tour, replacing the orchestra used during her television appearances. For the shows, Carey wore a beige outfit, with varying hairstyles. Neither remix version was performed during the tour.\n\nFor her Rainbow World Tour (2000) Carey performed the original version of the song, once again featuring the orchestra and live female background vocals. 2 years later on December 7, 2002, Carey performed the original version of \"My All\" in front of a crowd of 50,000 people, at the closing ceremony concert of the Mexican \"Teletón\", which took place in the country's Azteca Stadium. Since the in 2004, Carey has not performed the full version of the original, substituting it for the dance remix after the second verse. During the shows in the Adventures of Mimi tour, Carey donned a black bikini and matching cape, while featuring one male and two female background singers. On the Angels Advocate Tour (2010), she performed the original and dance remix versions, wearing a red outfit while performing the song seated. Again, the original and dance remix was performed as a medley, featuring the same backup from the previous tour. After completing the song, Carey was whisked away by a shirtless male dancer, and carried off the stage for a costume change, as the back-up continued into the dance version.\n\nOn February 25, 2014, Alisa Kozhikina, the representative of Russia to the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2014 won in the Grand Finals of Golos Deti, the Russian kids' edition of The Voice, performing a Russian version of the song called \"Vsyo\".\n\nCredits and personnel adapted from the \"Butterfly\" liner notes.\n\n\n\nU.S. CD Single\n\nU.S. CD Maxi Single\n\nU.S. CD /12\" Maxi Single\n\nEuropean CD Maxi Single\n\nU.S. 12\" Single\n\nEuropean 12\" Single\n\n"}

The show's writing was grounded in improvisation, and often lampooned current events stories. The show's structure also included a guest interview, in which the Colbert character attempts to deconstruct his opponent's argument. The show was taped in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, and the program's set is \"hyper-American\", epitomizing the character's ego. The show was taped and broadcast Monday through Thursday, with weeks taken off at multiple points in a given year for breaks.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" saw immediate critical and ratings successes, leading to various awards, including two Peabody Awards. The show's cultural influence—which occasionally would require a fair degree of participation from the show's audience, dubbed the Colbert Nation—extended beyond the program a number of times. This impact included the character running for U.S. President twice, co-hosting a rally at the National Mall, presenting a controversial performance at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and establishing a real Super PAC that raised a million dollars. In addition, the show inspired various forms of multimedia, including music and multiple best-selling books.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" satirized conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, and focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series \"The Dana Carvey Show\" in 1996, described as \"a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop.\" Colbert joined Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" in 1997, a year following its launch, then hosted by Craig Kilborn. When Jon Stewart became the program's host in 1999, \"The Daily Show\" developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Colbert recalled that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy.\n\nColbert became a fixture on \"The Daily Show\", occasionally hosting in Stewart's absence. In 2003, the program began running advertisements for a fictional program titled \"The Colbert Réport\", starring Colbert as a parody of cable news pundits. When fellow \"Daily Show\" star Steve Carell left to pursue a film and television career, Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network. He pitched \"The Colbert Report\" to the channel in 2004. Stewart pushed Comedy Central to pick up the show, and Colbert was given an eight-week tryout. Following the show's immediate success, the show \"quickly became a fixture in the late-night lineup.\" At its peak, the show averaged 1.5 million viewers each evening.\n\nThe fictional Colbert anchorman character became gradually toned down over the course of the show's run, as the host believed he would eventually need to move beyond it. He began to regard it as an act of discipline to perform as the character; he later remarked, \"to model behavior, you have to consume that behavior on a regular basis. It became very hard to watch punditry of any kind, of whatever political stripe.\" With his contract set to end in December 2014, he had already decided to leave the show when he was contacted by CBS to replace David Letterman as the host of its \"Late Show\" franchise. The show's ending was announced concurrently with Colbert's jump to CBS in April 2014. The last episode aired on December 18, 2014. The show was replaced on Comedy Central's late-night lineup by \"The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore\", another spinoff of \"The Daily Show\".\n\nThe character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series \"The Dana Carvey Show\" in 1996, described as \"a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop.\"\n\nWhen \"The Daily Show\" ran short on time, a short piece starring Colbert, advertising a fictional program titled \"The Colbert Réport\", was added into the program. In these sketches, Colbert began to amplify his character to parody news pundits. Colbert anchored many sketches in his persona, including \"Even Stepvhen\", in which he debated current issues with fellow correspondent Steve Carell, often devolving into petty name-calling and insults. Colbert and Carell were viewed as potential breakout stars by staff, and when Carell left the series in 2004 to start a US version of \"The Office\", Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network. Stewart and Karlin were already looking to expand the \"Daily Show\" franchise and their production company, Busboy. The duo supposedly came up with the idea for \"The Colbert Report\" after watching coverage of the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Bill O'Reilly. Colbert met with network president Doug Herzog the day following the 2004 Emmy Awards to first discuss the concept. The one-line pitch Colbert, Karlin and Stewart developed was \"Our version of \"the O'Reilly Factor\" with Stephen Colbert.\" Herzog committed to an eight-week tryout period without a pilot.\n\nBy the time of the 2004 election, the character was fully developed. In creating the character, which is designed to be repellant but entertaining, Colbert conferred with Stewart and Karlin. In expressing his hope that his character not be \"an asshole,\" Stewart remarked, \"You're not an asshole. You're an idiot. There's a difference.\" Head writer Allison Silverman reiterated this trait in a later interview, commenting, \"There is an essential innocence to his character.\" Colbert initially felt the character might not be sustainable in a longer format. Despite this, \"The Colbert Report\" was designed as an extension of the satiric goals of \"The Daily Show\", combining it with general silliness and character-driven humor. To make sure there was no overlap in subject matter with \"The Daily Show\", Karlin made trips between the studios during the show's early days to supervise scripts. For the first several years of the program, Colbert made an appearance at the end of each \"Daily Show\" in split-screen, having a short discussion with Stewart preceding his show.\n\nThe show's writing was grounded in improv, employing a \"yes to everything\" mentality. Much of the humor derived from extended improv games with the show's studio and at-home audience, such as Colbert's poll to name a bridge in Hungary after himself. Many of the writers had improv training and at one point put together \"improv evenings\" at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre once a month. Writers on \"The Colbert Report\" were predominantly male and white; Colbert acknowledged this lack of diversity, but he contended he had hired writers based solely on the quality of their material and had never looked at the names on writing packets submitted for employment. Subjects considered too dark were not even considered for comedic material; for example, the show would poke fun at press coverage of a tragedy, rather than the tragedy itself. Issues discussed on the show were later reported on actual newscasts, in turn allowing the show to comment on its own impact, creating an echo chamber of sorts. This led Colbert to describe his show, \"at its purest expression, [as] a pebble that we throw into the puddle of the news, and then we report on our own ripples.\"\n\nIdeas for each show were considered in the morning pitch meeting, which could range from \"harrowing\" to smooth. Described as having \"demanding standards\", Colbert is quoted as remarking, \"Let's make it perfect and then cut it.\" Although dozens of ideas were either chosen for the show or deleted, other ideas, saved for a later date, were often forgotten because of the pace of news. Ideas with considerable potential were put in the \"hopper\" to be developed and rewritten, while more fully formed ideas were placed in the \"pantry.\" Good jokes would still be sacrificed if they did not fit the character's specific point of view, which was deemed the inverse of what \"any logical person\" feels. At least one writer has described the job as \"all-consuming\", leaving no time for outside activities. Colbert himself eventually became withdrawn from morning meetings as the show continued on and he mulled a decision to leave.\n\nUsually by 11 a.m., a rough outline for the show was completed and writers sent off in pairs to create scripts that would be polished throughout the day. First, writers would scan news articles for ideas and partner together in pairs, with one \"keeping track of possible jokes.\" During an appearance at the New York Comedy Festival in 2013, some writers admitted to procrastinating until the last hour before rehearsal to complete their sections; Colbert confirmed that, in the program's early days, segments such as \"The Word\" were scripted entirely during the rewrite before rehearsal. Both writers read their dialogue aloud to see whether they thought the Colbert character would say it. As writers were working on their respective scripts, the show's production and graphics team compiled music, footage, and props needed for the show. To collect video clips, the show cross-referenced transcripts of hours and hours of archived TiVo recordings of news programs. In 2011, the show switched to Snapstream software, which streamlined the TV clip search and compilation process, allowing for searching closed captioning for select words. In addition, a group of staff coders and independent contractors developed Scripto software to collaborate on scripts in real time.\n\nBy 1 p.m., the show held a second production meeting to go over scripts and determine which pieces to edit. Scripts were \"hopefully\" completed around 4 p.m., and a rehearsal with the entire staff would begin at 5:30 p.m. or occasionally earlier. Afterward, final changes were made to the script. The final rewrite would take place in a \"small, red, poorly ventilated room\" until 6:45 p.m. Before interviewing his guests, Colbert met with them in the green room and acknowledged that he was playing a character, noting that the persona is \"willfully ignorant of what you know and care about\" and urging the guest to \"honestly disabuse me of what you see as my ignorance.\" Emily Lazar, a producer for the interview segments, advised guests to talk with Colbert as though he were a \"harmless drunk at the next bar stool.\" Guests would typically take their seats around 7 p.m., when a warm-up comedian (perhaps Jared Logan or Paul Mercurio) delivered jokes. Colbert, out of character, held a brief question and answer session with the audience prior to taping. Taping lasted as long as three hours but usually ended around 9 p.m., at which point the show was edited and sent to Comedy Central for broadcast. As the show was being edited, the staff met one last time to work through details for the next show.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" was taped and broadcast four nights a week, Monday–Thursday. The show's taping studio, at 513 W. 54th Street in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, was used for \"The Daily Show\" until July 2005, and has a capacity of 150. NEP Studio 54 on 54th Street is owned by NEP Broadcasting which is New York City's largest production facility and also owns \"The Daily Show\" set at NEP Studio 52 two blocks south on 52nd Street. Aside from the set, the show's production offices have been described as \"loft-like\" and \"all overhead pipes and exposed brick.\" Following the show's conclusion, the building was used for \"The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore\".\n\nThe set for \"The Colbert Report\" was called \"The Eagle's Nest\" and reflects and facilitates Colbert's self-aggrandizing style. It was designed by Jim Fenhagen, and was intended to both capture the character's ego and be \"hyper-American.\" Elements incorporated into the set included architectural lines converged to Colbert's desk, and radial beams coming out from behind his chair. Colbert's main influence for the set was Leonardo da Vinci's \"The Last Supper\", with the Colbert character as Jesus Christ. In the set, \"virtually every inch emblazoned with Colbert's name or the initial C\"; his name, initials and the name of the show appear on the desk's plasma screen, on the rafters above the desk, and the desk itself is shaped like a giant \"C\". The background includes faux artifacts from the character's backstory, which are seldom seen by viewers. \"I kept saying, 'People might not really notice this.' But when you're working with a comedy team, they really get into it. They couldn't help themselves,\" said Fenhagen. Among these touches are the United States Constitution, a miniature Ten Commandments, and a CliffsNotes guide to American government.\n\nThe set was described as \"part Riefenstahlesque homage to the star, part symbologic gallery — where alert viewers are rewarded with snarky jokes at every turn.\" Above a fireplace is a portrait of Colbert; it originally showed Colbert standing in front of the same mantel with another portrait of himself. On the show's first anniversary, the portrait was replaced by one of Colbert standing in front of the mantel with the first portrait above it, and with each successive year, it became Colbert standing in front of the previous year's painting. The graphics used throughout the show and the studio itself are saturated with American flags, bald eagles, Captain America's shield, and other patriotic imagery.\n\nTypically, Colbert starts with the audience cheering and teasers regarding the show's topics and guest; each headline is structured to be a deliberate pun. The series of puns are followed by a verbal metaphor that promotes the show and is almost always finished with, \"This is the \"Colbert Report\".\" The show's original opening title sequence began with an eagle diving past the host, following by images of Americana, stock footage of Colbert, and words describing Colbert flying by (some of which have been used as The Word). The first word used was \"Grippy\", and has changed to include, among others, \"Megamerican\", \"Lincolnish\", \"Superstantial\", \"Flagaphile\", and \"Factose Intolerant\". The May 4 episode in 2009 featured hints planted by J. J. Abrams about when and where Colbert would be in the Persian Gulf, and \"Farewellison\" for the final episode of former producer Allison Silverman. The show's opening credits depict the Colbert character clutching an American flag. On January 4, 2010, a new opening debuted. The opening begins and ends with an eagle as before, but features new background renderings, new shots of Stephen Colbert, and is now colored in an American, red white and blue motif. The show's theme music is \"Baby Mumbles\" by Cheap Trick. Colbert phoned guitarist Rick Nielsen during development of the show to discuss the theme, noting that he loved the band's song \"I Want You to Want Me\"; the show's theme music is largely that song's melody backwards.\n\nFollowing the opening sequence, Colbert most often proceeds with a run-through of recent headlines in a manner parodying traditional news broadcasts; this is similar to \"The Daily Show\" but with a faux-right-wing spin. The program typically continues with Colbert addressing a specific topic. Colbert often calls to \"Jimmy\", a reference to program director Jim Hoskinson, to roll video clips. That topic will often lead into a \"The Word\" segment, which juxtaposes Colbert's commentary with satirical bullet points on-screen, a parody of \"The O'Reilly Factor\"s \"Talking Points Memo\". On occasion he will conduct a short interview with someone having to do with the topic. The format of the middle segment varies, but it is normally a visual presentation or skit. Often, these skits are parts of recurring segments, which may include \"Better Know a District\", in which Colbert interviews a U.S. Representative from a certain district of the United States; \"Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger\", in which Colbert voices his approval or disapproval of prominent people and news items; \"Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.\", a health segment; \"The Sport Report\" with the \"t\" in both Sport and Report silent, a sports segment; and \"The ThreatDown\", in which Colbert lists the five greatest threats to America, and others. His newest segment, \"Thought for Food\" deals with the consumption of specific foods across the world.\n\nSometimes, there is a \"\"Colbert Report Special Repor-t\"\" (the final 't' pronounced with special emphasis), or even a \"\"Colbert Report, Sport Report, Special Repor-t\"\", in which Colbert devotes a section of an episode, and sometimes the entire episode to a special subject. The third segment is almost always an interview with a celebrity guest, often an author or government official. Unlike the late night talk show standard of the guest walking out to the host's desk, Colbert instead runs to a separate area of the set to interview his guest, basking in the applause and glory meant for the guest. On the interview segment of the show, Colbert frequently attempts to nail his guest by using various rhetorical devices and fallacies to prove them wrong. The real-life Colbert once remarked that his personal favorite segment of the program were the interviews, which involved more listening on his end in order for the character to \"ignorantly deconstruct\" his opponent's argument. The third segment of the show is on occasion a musical guest. Prominent musical guests have included Metallica, Paul McCartney, Rush, Green Day, Paul Simon, Crosby Stills & Nash, Pavement, Cat Stevens, Yo-Yo Ma, Radiohead and Black Star. Afterwards, Colbert ends the show by giving some parting words to the audience or, if short for time, a simple \"that's it for the report everybody, good night\".\n\nThe host of \"The Colbert Report\" is Stephen Colbert, a \"self-important right-wing commentator\", portrayed by his real-life namesake. The character incorporates aspects of Colbert's real life, but is primarily a parody of cable news pundits, particularly Bill O'Reilly of Fox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor\", whom he refers to as \"Papa Bear\". To this end, the character even incorporates O'Reilly's mannerisms, described as his \"pen-wielding, hand-stabbing gestures.\" O'Reilly's use of \"talking points\" — illustrated onscreen graphics reflecting the host's opinions — are parodied on \"The Colbert Report\" with the segment \"The Word\". He initially incorporated long-winded, verbose metaphors to parody CNN correspondent Aaron Brown. In addition, the character was also heavily inspired by Stone Phillips, Bill Kurtis and \"especially\" Geraldo Rivera. \"I loved the way Geraldo made reporting a story seem like an act of courage,\" Colbert told a reporter in 2012.\n\nThe core principle of \"The Colbert Report\" is that Colbert is a \"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot.\" The character believes that he himself is the news: rather than a vessel to deliver the news to the audience, or a general member of the media, the character sees himself as more important than the news. He is veracious in his approach, while often ridiculously overblown in his statements. The character is egomaniacal, fact-averse (\"factose intolerant\"), God-fearing, and hyper-patriotic. He claims to be an independent who is often mistaken for a Republican, but uniformly despises liberals and generally agrees with the actions and decisions of the Republican Party. Colbert's character has been described as a \"caustic right-wing bully\". The character exists not in opposition to political leaders, but to common ignorances; for example, his insistence that then-presidential candidate Barack Obama had Socialist leanings was based on public misconceptions. In parodying the cult of personality, the Colbert character also developed a real-life equivalent, creating what was dubbed the \"Colbert Nation\". While giving the character a certain mythos was part of the show's inception, show producers did not set out to create a loyal following; the joke was that the character thought he had an influence, but that was a figment of his ego-riddled imagination.\n\nDespite his appearance of always being in charge, Colbert is vulnerable: he feels deeply threatened by those wielding more power than he, and he suffers from \"arctophobia\", the fear of bears, which he refers to as \"giant, marauding, godless killing machines\". He will alert the audience to what he perceives as the latest national threat (the subject of a recurring bit, \"ThreatDown\"), only to justify his own fears and impose those onto his audience.\n\nAs the show progressed, Colbert gradually began to tone down the character, allowing guests in interviews to \"get his or her own message across.\" The show's longevity created what \"The New York Times\" described as \"a winking quality to the act, a sense that we’re all in on the joke.\" Colbert himself acknowledged that he \"rarely hit it as hard as I used to,\" noting that \"You have to be vigilant to stay ignorant.\" He noted that his own personal opinions can occasionally align with his character's, when liberal guests' agendas appeared based on dislike rather than logical argument. Politician and former vice president Al Gore accidentally referred to the persona as a \"character\" in a 2011 interview on the show, and in 2013, Colbert further blurred lines when he spoke regarding the death of his mother on the program. In doing so, many commentators referred the show's longevity and the development of a \"third\" Colbert — one a faux pundit and one informed by the performer's own life. In the show's credits, Colbert was credited with a title, which deliberately became increasingly cumbersome as the show progressed: \"Her Excellency The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World✱✱ featuring Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France\".\n\nWhen O'Reilly appeared on \"The Daily Show\" before the second episode of \"The Colbert Report\" aired, he commented, \"Before we get started, somebody told me walking in here, you got some French guy on after you making fun of me?\", and made several references in the following interview to 'the French Guy'. In a subsequent \"Newsweek\" interview, O'Reilly said that he \"feels it's a compliment\" to have Colbert parody him because Colbert \"isn't mean-spirited\" and does not \"use [his] platform to injure people\". Later, Colbert replied on-air, \"I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist.\"\n\nColbert disagreed that the show's emphasis on politics represented a liberal bias, noting that he himself was uninterested in modern politics. He believed that political issues reflect basic human behavior, which he viewed as his satirical specialty, noting, \"If I thought I had a political point, I'd be in big trouble.\" In another interview, Colbert remarked, \"I'm not someone with a particular political ax to grind. I'm a comedian. I love hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" premiered in October 2005. The first guest was Stone Phillips, a partial influence on the character. In the debut episode, Colbert coined the word \"truthiness\", defined as \"a quality characterizing a 'truth' that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively 'from the gut' or because it 'feels right' without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts.\" \"Truthiness\" was named Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster. The character's forceful nature confused some in the program's early days. During an appearance on the segment \"Better Know a District\" in the show's first season, a frustrated Barney Frank declined to continue, deeming the conversation too dumb. In one early episode, the Colbert character purported to be a former member of a 1980s new wave group, Stephen & the Colberts, and released a fictional music video from the band for the song \"Charlene (I'm Right Behind You)\".\n\nThe show's popularity resulted in Colbert headlining the 2006 White House Correspondents' Dinner, which he performed in character. The controversial, searing routine targeted President George W. Bush and the media, and was greeted with chilly reception from the audience. Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand after his presentation, several of Bush's aides and supporters walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide commented that the President had \"that look that he's ready to blow\". Colbert's performance quickly became an Internet and media sensation. According to \"Vanity Fair\", the speech transformed Colbert as a \"folk hero\" for liberals, and was later described by Frank Rich as the \"defining moment\" of the 2006 midterm elections. Adam Sternbergh of \"New York\", a year after the show's debut, deemed the character \"something very close to what he's parodying, a kind of Bill O'Reilly for the angry left.\"\n\nIn 2006, Colbert encouraged fans to vote for his name to be the new name of a bridge in Hungary, which was being decided via an online poll; he beat the runner-up by more than 14 million votes. He was, however, disqualified, as the name of the bridge was intended to be a memoriam. Later that year, he began a mock feud with indie rock group the Decemberists over the subject of who was the first to challenge fans to create a green screen video; the fake conflict culminated in a guitar solo competition on the show's final episode of the year, featuring guest appearances from guitarist Peter Frampton and Dr. Henry Kissinger. Colbert later recalled it as the show's \"craziest\" moment, changing the way the staff viewed the program: \"Because you realize the character believes anything he thinks, says, [or] cares about is important, anything fits on the show. [...] That is the show where we said, oh, there is unlimited open field running.\"\n\nIn February 2007, Ben & Jerry's unveiled a new ice cream flavor in honor of Stephen Colbert, named Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream. All proceeds were donated to charity through the Stephen Colbert AmeriCone Dream Fund, which distributed the money to various causes. In June 2007, Colbert broke his left wrist while performing his warm-up for the show. It was the subject of an extended bit on the program, including the creation of the \"Wriststrong\" wrist band, based on Lance Armstrong's \"Livestrong\" wrist band, which donated all proceeds to the Yellow Ribbon Fund. Colbert remained on the air without writers during the Writers Guild of America strike in 2007–08. Colbert modified the pronunciation of the show's name, pronouncing both of the formerly elided final \"t\"s (); a similar move was made by \"The Daily Show\" which returned to air as \"A Daily Show\". During this period, he staged a mock feud between himself, Jon Stewart, and \"Late Night\" host Conan O'Brien over who made Republican Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.\n\nIn 2008, Colbert made a series of jokes directed at various towns in the United States named \"Canton\", with many attracting negative responses from each respective area's local government and residents. The same year, the show filmed a tongue-in-cheek Christmas special titled \"\". In 2009, Colbert filmed a series of four episodes for the troops in Baghdad, Iraq. He had a suit tailored for him in the Army Combat Uniform pattern and went through an abbreviated version of the Army's basic training regimen. On the first of the four episodes, Colbert had his head shaved on stage by General Ray Odierno who was jokingly \"ordered\" to do so by President Barack Obama, who appeared on the episode via a pre-recorded segment from the White House.\n\nIn 2010, while in character, Colbert appeared before judiciary subcommittee hearing on the issue of farm workers and immigration. \"The New Yorker\" used Colbert's testimony before Congress as an example of the \"third\" Colbert: \"Colbert was thoughtful and sincere—and had ruined the whole thing. By speaking honestly, he had become the very thing he was mocking, a celebrity testifying before Congress.\" Beginning in June 2011, the show created a long-running gag that involved Colbert starting his own actual super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow, described by the character as \"100 percent legal and at least 10 percent ethical.\"\n\nIn 2012, Colbert interviewed illustrator/author Maurice Sendak, who managed to get him to break character; show staff and Colbert himself retrospectively labeled the segment one of the show's more memorable moments. The \"Los Angeles Times\" called the September 2013 interview with intelligence official Philip Mudd his \"most awkward interview\", stating Mudd \"could barely disguise his contempt\" for Colbert.\n\nPresident Barack Obama guested during the show's final month, in a show taped from George Washington University in Washington, D.C.; Obama sat in Colbert's seat and presided over \"The Wørd\" segment.\n\nThe final episode aired on December 18, 2014. In the episode Stephen becomes immortal after accidentally killing \"Grimmy\" during the opening of the segment of \"Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.\". This leads to Stephen singing \"We'll Meet Again\" in its entirety along with a large group of famous friends including Jon Stewart, Jeff Daniels, Sam Waterston, Big Bird, Charlie Rose, Terry Gross, Keith Olbermann, Tom Brokaw, Alan Alda, Yo Yo Ma, Ken Burns, Cyndi Lauper, Patrick Stewart, Randy Newman, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Henry Kissinger, Alex Trebek, Mandy Patinkin, Lesley Stahl, George Lucas, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Gloria Steinem, Elijah Wood, Jake Tapper, Bob Costas, Smaug and Cookie Monster.\n\nReviews of \"The Colbert Report\" upon its 2005 premiere were positive, although critics were generally skeptical that the character could extend beyond one season without growing tiresome. While positively reviewing the program as a whole, Maureen Ryan of the \"Chicago Tribune\" echoed these sentiments: \"The biggest question hanging over \"The Colbert Report\" is whether the show’s sendup of the pomposity and fear-mongering of cable news blowhards will be as appealing in the long term.\" Melanie McFarland of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" summarized the show's early reaction: \"Critics and bloggers either loved the premiere or declared themselves to be unmoved, but that's the standard reaction after any late-night program's debut. A truer measure will be seen in coming weeks, after the hype wears off and the ratings lose their exuberance.\"\n\nGilbert Cruz of \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted that \"Colbert proves that the line between serious TV journalism and utter nonsense is a very thin one indeed.\" Heather Havrilesky of Salon was effusive, remarking, \"Not only does Colbert maintain his persona without skipping a beat throughout the entire show, but he’s got great comic timing, the show’s writers are brilliant, and the whole thing is pure foolish, bizarre, idiotic fun.\" Barry Garron of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" dubbed it an \"auspicious debut\", writing, \"The new show dovetails nicely with its lead-in to present a solid hour of skewered news and punctured pomposity.\" \"Variety\" Brian Lowry commented that the show had an \"impressive start with a topnotch premiere followed by a respectable second outing.\" Paul Brownfield of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"In the run-up to the show it all sounded a bit hard to get your head around, but in the flesh the show zinged, at least this first week.\"\n\n\"The Boston Globe\" Matthew Gilbert praised the show's wordplay, summarizing, \"Colbert's a clever creation, and a necessary one, and he deserves an opportunity to offend as many people as possible with his pompous blather.\" Alessandra Stanley of \"The New York Times\" commented that the show was a welcome addition to the Comedy Central lineup, remarking, \"What puts Mr. Colbert over the top is that he is not just impersonating well known television personalities, he also uses parody to score larger points about politics and the press.\" Nevertheless, there were more negative reviews: \"USA Today\" Robert Bianco opined that the show \"tried too hard\", writing, \"Unfortunately, in just two weeks on the air, this half-hour spoof of a no-spin-zone type show has already stretched Colbert's character and the artifice that supports it past its natural breaking point.\"\n\n\"The New Yorker\" remarked that the show remained funny throughout its entire run. \"The Colbert Report\" currently scores favorable reviews, with 65/100 on Metacritic (first season), while its viewers' ranking on the site is higher at 8.7/10.\n\nIn a 2009 academic analysis of the show's popularity, Temple University researcher, Heather LaMarre found that the show appealed to both liberals and conservatives, concluding, \"there was no significant difference between the groups in thinking Colbert was funny, but conservatives were more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely meant what he said while liberals were more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements\". Malcolm Gladwell discussed LaMarre's findings in his \"Revisionist History\" podcast, \"The Satire Paradox\" (2016).\n\nThe ratings of \"The Colbert Report\", from its premiere, benefited from the lead-in \"The Daily Show\" provides, which at the time of the show's debut averaged 1.3 million viewers per night. Comedy Central had previously struggled to produce a hit program on par with \"The Daily Show\", and were counting on \"Colbert\" after a string of failures. \"The Colbert Report\" drew 1.13 million viewers for its premiere episode, 47 percent greater than the average for that time slot over the previous four weeks, and 98 percent of the viewership of \"The Daily Show\", which had Comedy Central's second-largest viewership. Averaged over its opening week, \"The Report\" had 1.2 million viewers per episode, more than double the average for the same time the previous year, when the time slot was occupied by \"Too Late with Adam Carolla\".\n\nThe show regularly began attracting over one million viewers with near immediacy. The show also drew more young men, a powerful demographic, than other late-night hosts (at that time, Jay Leno, David Letterman, and Conan O'Brien). Within a year, \"The Colbert Report\" began averaging 1.5 million viewers per night. In early 2008, in the midst of the writer's strike, \"Colbert\" posted an eleven-percent gain over its averages from the following fall.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, viewership decreased from 1.2 million to 1.1 million. In 2013, \"The Colbert Report\" was the second most-watched late-night talk show (behind \"The Daily Show\") among the demographic of adults 18-49, beating competition \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" in that demographic for the first time. That year, \"The Colbert Report \" attracted $52.1 million in advertising for an audience whose median age was 39.4, about a year younger than \"The Daily Show\". In 2014, the final year of the show's run, ratings were down three percent (coinciding with a general ratings slide for cable television).\n\nThe series finale on December 18, 2014 was watched by 2.4 million viewers, making it the most watched episode ever in the show's history. The finale was the most watched cable program of the night in its time slot, beating \"The Daily Show\" which was seen by two million viewers.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" received numerous awards and accolades throughout its run. The show was nominated for four Emmy Awards in its inaugural year, but lost to \"The Daily Show\". The show was nominated each year for the rest of its run for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Series, but lost each time to \"The Daily Show\" until 2013, when it broke the latter program's winning streak, dubbed the longest in Emmy history. Colbert subsequently referenced his win on his program as the conclusion of Stewart's \"reign of terror.\" It also won the award the following year, and was nominated in the same category in 2015.\n\nThe show received two Peabody Awards, recognizing its excellence in news and entertainment. It also won two Grammy Awards, one for Best Comedy Album for the soundtrack to the special \"A Colbert Christmas\", and later for Best Spoken Word Album for the audiobook to \"America Again\". Colbert and Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear was nominated for four Daytime Emmy awards in 2011, including the Outstanding Special Class Special category and the Outstanding Special Class Writing category.\n\nIn March 2014, the show attracted controversy when Colbert used a \"fatuously fake parody stereotype character, 'Ching-Chong Ding-Dong,'\" to \"satirize knee-jerk mockery\" of Asian dialect. The name had been used before without incident, but the show's official Twitter account — run by an unknown individual — tweeted the remarks without context, leading to wide outrage over social media, including a hashtag campaign, \"#CancelColbert\", that was a worldwide trending topic for over 24 hours, thanks in-part by Colbert himself helping make it go viral for his show.\n\n\"The New Yorker\" wrote that \"Colbert has made vital observations about the American political system, particularly about the sordid role that money plays within it. \"The Colbert Report\" and the \"Daily Show\" [...] have changed the way that young liberals of a certain class think and talk about civic culture.\"\nThe show also coined another word, \"wikiality\", that means \"reality as decided on majority rule.\" Viewers of the show also coined a word, \"freem\", based on its inclusion in the show's opening sequence; the word refers to \"'freedom' without having to 'do' anything — without any responsibility or action.\" In response to the \"Better Know a District\" segment, Rahm Emanuel, then the Democratic Caucus chair, instructed incoming freshmen not to do appearances on the show in 2007. In 2008, East Carolina University associate professor Jason Bond named a species of trapdoor spider \"Aptostichus stephencolberti\" in honor of Stephen Colbert.\n\nThe \"Colbert Bump\" is defined, connotatively by the \"Report\", as an increase in popularity of a person (author, musician, politician, etc.) or thing (website, etc.) as a result of appearing as a guest on or (in the case of a thing) being mentioned on the show. For example, if a politician appears on \"The Colbert Report\", they may become more popular with certain voters and thus are more likely to be elected. According to the American Political Science Association, contributions to Democratic politicians rose 40% for 30 days after an appearance on the show. Magazines such as \"GQ\", \"Newsweek\", and \"Sports Illustrated\" have all had sales spikes when Colbert appeared on their covers.\n\nViewers of \"The Colbert Report\" were on numerous occasions cited as being more knowledgeable about current events than traditional news viewers. In April 2007, a Pew Research Center report cited both \"Colbert\" and \"The Daily Show\" viewers as more well-informed than those who gathered their information via newspapers, television news and radio. Colbert's Super PAC coverage was widely lauded, and studies later found that this coverage was more effective than traditional news programs at educating the audience on campaign finance. He was awarded a Peabody Award for the parody, which was described as an \"innovative means of teaching American viewers about the landmark court decision\". The Annenberg Public Policy Center reported in 2014 that the Colbert Super PAC segments increased viewers' knowledge of PAC and 501(c)(4) campaign finance regulation more successfully than other types of news media.\n\nOutside the United States, \"The Colbert Report\" was shown in Canada on the cable service The Comedy Network, simultaneously with its original U.S. broadcast (beginning a few weeks after the series debuted). Episodes would also air in Canada on traditional over-the-air broadcaster CTV, one hour after their appearance on The Comedy Network. On September 22, 2014, due to The Comedy Network's acquisition of Canadian rights to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", the program began airing on M3 and did so for the remainder of the show's run.\n\nIt airs on The Comedy Channel in Australia, Comedy Central in New Zealand, and on Maxxx in the Philippines. , The Colbert Report has also been broadcast in Africa on DSTV's version of Comedy Central. It aired on FX in the United Kingdom until they decided not to renew their contract in May 2009. In Portugal, it airs on Sic Radical.\n\nBeginning June 3, 2008, \"The Colbert Report\" also aired on the ShowComedy channel of Showtime Arabia (Currently OSN First HD), a channel which broadcasts in the Middle East and North Africa. The show is transmitted on a one-day delay from original transmission in the US.\n\nThe show was shown during prime time on Australia's free-to-air ABC2 in 2010, however the channel was outbid for rights for 2011. The show was available directly on the colbernation.com website for part of 2011, with Australian advertisements; however, Australian access is now blocked.\n\nSeveral international markets also air \"The Colbert Report Global Edition\", which shows highlights from the previous week's shows and includes a special introduction by Stephen Colbert at the start of the program. This means a new or newly repackaged episode can be screened every weekday.\n\nIn addition, most recent episodes (usually 3 weeks back) are available in full length on colbertnation.com. However, some international audiences are unable to view the videos or episodes.\n\nThe show spawned various merchandise and multimedia related to the show. Three books were released to accompany the show's humor, the first being \"I Am America (And So Can You!)\", released both in print and as an audiobook in 2007. In 2012, two spinoff books of the show were released. \"America Again\" is a sequel to the show's first book, and addresses topics including Wall Street, campaign finance, energy policy, healthcare, eating on the campaign trail, and the United States Constitution. Another book, \"I Am a Pole (And So Can You!)\", was released the same year and purports to be a children's book telling the story of a fictional pole finding its purpose in life.\n\nSegments from the show were also released on DVD during its run. \"The Best of The Colbert Report\", released in 2007, contains several of the show's most memorable early moments. The show's Christmas special, \"\", was also released on DVD the following year. The soundtrack of that special also saw a digital release on the iTunes Store after its broadcast, and contains music from Feist, John Legend, Willie Nelson, Toby Keith, Jon Stewart, Elvis Costello, and Colbert himself. In 2011, Jack White's record label Third Man Records released a 7\" vinyl single of Stephen Colbert and The Black Belles performing \"Charlene II (I'm Over You)\", which they also performed together on the show.\n\n"}

Actor Brian Pettifer is her brother. Around 1966 she started singing in folk clubs, and in 1967 began studying modern languages at the University of London, but dropped out after four months. She changed her name to Linda Peters. By day she sang advertising jingles, including one with Manfred Mann. She recorded the Bob Dylan song \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\", released as an MGM single in 1968 by Paul McNeill and Linda Peters, McNeill being another friend of Sandy Denny and Alex Campbell. They released a second single as Paul and Linda in 1969 on Page One, the John D. Loudermilk song \"You're Taking My Bag\". She met Richard Thompson in 1969, but they did not record together until 1972.\n\nHer reputation led to her being invited to join the Bunch, a loose supergroup of folk rock luminaries including former Fairport Convention members Sandy Denny, Richard Thompson, and Ashley Hutchings that recorded an album called \"Rock On\". This was a set of 1950s rock and roll classics. A single was released from the album: The Everly Brothers' hit \"When Will I Be Loved\", which was a duet by Linda and Sandy. A second single was released soon afterwards \"The Loco-Motion\", sung by Linda alone. Two versions exist, one with \"Sweet Little Rock 'n' Roller\" as the B-side and in a picture sleeve, another with \"Don't Be Cruel\" on the flip. Later in 1972 Linda and Richard were backing singers on Sandy Denny's solo album \"Sandy\".\n\nLinda teamed up with Simon Nicol and Richard (after he had left Fairport Convention). Calling themselves \"Hokey Pokey\", they toured as a trio. Linda and Richard married in 1972. Richard's first solo album, \"Henry the Human Fly\", also recorded in 1972, sold poorly. Linda sang on Fairport's album \"Rosie\" (1973), credited as Linda Peters.\n\nThe next album, \"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight\" (1974) was credited to \"Richard and Linda Thompson\". Two albums followed in 1975: \"Hokey Pokey\" and \"Pour Down Like Silver\". Richard had started to take an interest in Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, in 1973. After the tour, the couple went to a Sufi commune in East Anglia for six months, then to another in Maida Vale. Richard announced that he would never play again, but returned after three years. Linda found herself in a community where all the food was prepared by the women. In her words, the members were \"white middle-class people trying to punish themselves, and everybody else. It taught me a lot. To stay away from sects, mostly.\"\n\nTheir come-back album was called \"First Light\" (1978). Richard's writing has a strong thread of disdain for fame, wealth and worldly values and attacks political hypocrisy, often in wildly abstract metaphors. \"Sunnyvista\" followed in 1979, and \"Shoot Out the Lights\" in 1982.\n\n\"Shoot Out The Lights\" was surprisingly successful in America, and the Thompsons, despite the fractured state of their relationship, were offered a long and lucrative tour of the U.S. Simon Nicol described the final tour, in the summer of 1982, as being \"like walking on a tightrope\", and that as a result the first thing he did on stage was \"look for the exit\". The couple had separated by the time that the American tour started, and were barely speaking to each other.\n\nThe penultimate date of the tour was in Los Angeles. Linda then went to stay with her friend Linda Ronstadt. The tapes were finally released in October 2010 in the \"Shoot Out The Lights\" box set, although a version of \"Walking on a Wire\" from earlier in the tour is on the Free Reed \"RT\" boxed set. When Richard left Linda, she had just given birth to their third child, Kamila.\n\nLinda lost her voice for the next two years as a result of spasmodic dysphonia. She made a new start in 1984, singing with \"The Home Service\" at the National Theatre's production of medieval mystery plays and in 1985 she released her solo album \"One Clear Moment\", then fell silent for eleven years. One song from the album, called \"Telling Me Lies\", written with Betsy Cook, was recorded by Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton, and Linda Ronstadt for their \"Trio\" album in 1987. The recording was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Country Song category. Linda retired from music to run an antique jewellery shop in Bond Street, central London. She married Steve Kenis, an American who was an agent for recording artists. In 1985 Richard married U.S. folk club organiser, Nancy Covey.\n\nA compilation of Linda's earlier work, \"Dreams Fly Away\" (1996), included both previously released songs and alternate versions of some of her better-known songs. It was received politely but did not sell well. In 1999, Linda's mother died. This provoked an outpouring of sorrow and regenerated her determination to sing. Linda was diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia, preventing her from singing. A temporary cure was found. By having botox injected into her throat, she could regain her normal singing voice for a few months. \"Give Me a Sad Song\" (2001) was positively reviewed. In 2002, she released a new CD, \"Fashionably Late\", which featured several family members, including her son Teddy Thompson and daughter Kamila Thompson, as well as an appearance on one song by Richard Thompson.\n\nLinda appeared along with her son Teddy, her friends The McGarrigles, and Kate McGarrigle's children Martha Wainwright and Rufus Wainwright (amongst others) in Hal Wilner's \"Came So Far For Beauty\" tribute concerts to the music of Leonard Cohen from 2003 to 2006. Linda sang the Cohen songs \"A Thousand Kisses Deep\" and \"Alexandra Leaving\". She appeared again with Teddy Thompson with The McGarrigles and Wainwrights for some of their family concerts, including the McGarrigle Christmas shows. In 2007, Linda released yet another set of original songs and covers, \"Versatile Heart\". Like \"Fashionably Late\", this too was primarily a collaboration with son Teddy Thompson, and the CD also features a supporting cast of family and friends. The CD was well received in the press. The CD opens and closes with two arrangements of a Teddy Thompson instrumental piece, \"Stay Bright\", the first an acoustic version, and the second a version for string quartet arranged by famed Nick Drake collaborator Robert Kirby. She contributed vocals to the Primal Scream album \"Beautiful Future\" (2008), on the track \"Over & Over\".\n\nLinda and Richard Thompson performed a duet at 12 June 2010 Meltdown Festival tribute concert to Kate McGarrigle, which Richard coordinated.\n\nLinda's fourth solo album, \"Won't Be Long Now\", was released on 15 October 2013. The album features compositions and backing vocals from Teddy Thompson and his sisters as well as guitar work by Richard Thompson.\n\nLinda appears on the album \"Family\" (2014) by the band Thompson (named for all the Thompsons that appear) having written two songs for the project. The album was produced by her son Teddy Thompson and features Richard Thompson and The Rails, who are Linda's daughter Kamila Thompson and her husband James Walbourne, as well as other related musicians, including Walbourne's brother and Richard Thompson's son from his second marriage.\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson (live)\n\nSolo albums\n\nOther projects\n\nIn 2009, \"No Telling\" from \"Fashionably Late\" was included in Topic Records' 70-year anniversary boxed set \"Three Score and Ten\" as track fifteen on the fifth CD.\n\nSolo compilations\n\nSingles – Richard and Linda Thompson\n\n"}

However, because softer and more primitive wickets meant backup bowlers were often unnecessary, Sharpe could never get into form once William Lockwood began developing as a bowler late in 1891, and his county career was, for his time, quite short despite some notable successes in Australia.\n\nThough born in Nottinghamshire to the cricketer Samuel Sharpe, Sharpe was overlooked by his native county in the 1880s when bowlers such as Shaw and Attewell could do everything needed to win matches, and he qualified for Surrey in the late 1880s. He emerged in 1889 with 5 for 5 against Oxford University, but was always overshadowed by Lohmann in purely county cricket.\n\nHowever, in 1890 Sharpe developed so much that he took 102 wickets in county matches for just 12.08 each – beating Lohmann in the averages. Because of his superb work in the \"short spells of fine weather\" (\"Wisden\" 1891) it was thought Sharpe was the best hard-wicket bowler in England. In 1891, Sharpe fully maintained his reputation for three months, with 9 for 47 on a bumpy wicket against Middlesex being outstanding, but he fell off in August as Lockwood showed some deadly form. However, his reputation on hard wickets meant he was already an automatic choice for the 1891/1892 Ashes tour and he worked remarkably hard – often with considerable success, as when he took 6 for 84 off 51 overs in the First Test at the MCG.\n\nIn 1892, though, Sharpe could never get into form and he was dropped from the Surrey side long before the season ended. Though he was recalled in 1893 when Richardson was injured, he did nothing and Surrey released him at the end of the year. He played for Nottinghamshire a couple of times in 1894, but any hopes he would strengthen their weakening bowling were destroyed very quickly: he took only ten wickets at 28.40 under conditions tremendously favourable to bowlers, and retired at the then-remarkably young age of 28.\n\nSharpe bowled fast-medium and could make the ball break back to an unusual degree on hard pitches. His extra-fast yorker was often deadly. Having lost an eye, he had no pretensions as a batsman, but he was quite active in the field for a player in that time.\n\n"}

It is a hollow in the ground in which water may collect or in which a deposit of salt remains after water has evaporated. The 120-kilometre-long (75-mile-long) dry lakebed and its surroundings are protected as Etosha National Park, Namibia's second-largest wildlife park, covering 22,270 km. The pan is mostly dry but after a heavy rain it will acquire a thin layer of water, which is heavily salted by the mineral deposits on the surface.\n\nEtosha, meaning 'Great White Place' is made of a large mineral pan.\nThe area exhibits a characteristic white and greenish surface, which spreads over 4,800 km. The pan is believed to have developed through tectonic plate activity over about ten million years. Around 16,000 years ago, when ice sheets were melting across the land masses of the Northern Hemisphere, a wet climate phase in southern Africa filled Etosha Lake. Today however the Etosha Pan is mostly dry clay mud split into hexagonal shapes as it dries and cracks, and is seldom seen with even a thin sheet of water covering it.\nIt is assumed that the Kunene River fed the lake at that time, but tectonic plate movements over time caused a change in river direction, resulting in the lake running dry and leaving a salt pan. Now the Ekuma River, the Oshigambo River and the Omurambo Ovambo River are the sole seasonal source of water for the lake. Typically, little river water or sediment reaches the dry lake because water seeps into the riverbed along its course, reducing discharge along the way.\n\nIn the colonial era, the first non-Africans to explore this area were the Europeans Charles John Andersson and Francis Galton in 1851.\n\nThe surrounding area is dense mopane woodland which is occupied by herds of elephants on the south side of the lake. Mopane trees are common throughout south-central Africa, and host the mopane worm, which is the larval form of the moth \"Gonimbrasia belina\", and an important source of protein for rural communities.\n\nThe salt desert supports very little plant life except for the blue-green algae that gives the Etosha its characteristic colouring, and grasses like \"Sporobolus spicatus\" which quickly grow in the wet mud following a rain. Away from the lake there is grassland that supports grazing animals.\n\nThis harsh dry land with little vegetation and small amounts of salty water, when it is present at all, supports little wildlife all year round but is used by a large number of migratory birds. The hypersaline pan supports brine shrimp and a number of extremophile micro-organisms tolerant of the high saline conditions.(C.Michael Hogan. 2010.) In particularly rainy years the Etosha pan becomes a lake approximately 10 cm in depth and becomes a breeding ground for flamingos, which arrive in their thousands, and great white pelican (\"Pelecanus onocrotalus\").\n\nThe surrounding savanna is home to thousands of mammals that will visit the pan and surrounding waterholes when there is water. These include quite large numbers of zebra (\"Equus quagga\"), blue wildebeest (\"Connocheatus taurinus\"), gemsbok, eland and springbok (\"Antidorcas marsupialis\") as well as black rhinoceros, elephants, lions, leopards, and giraffe.\n\nThe Etosha pan is completely within the national park and is designated as a Ramsar wetland of international importance and a World Wildlife Fund ecoregion (Etosha Pan halophytics).\n\n"}

{"id": "1839065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839065", "title": "Bobby Richardson", "text": "Bobby Richardson\n\nRobert Clinton Richardson, Jr. (born August 19, 1935) is an American former professional baseball second baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees from 1955 through 1966. Batting and throwing right-handed, he formed a top double play combination with fellow Yankee infielders Clete Boyer and Tony Kubek. He became the only World Series Most Valuable Player to be selected from the losing team when he won the award for his play in the 1960 World Series. In 1962, he led the American League (AL) in hits with 209 and snared a line drive off the bat of Willie McCovey to win the 1962 World Series for the Yankees.\n\nBorn in Sumter, South Carolina, Richardson grew up desiring to play for the Yankees after seeing the 1942 film \"The Pride of the Yankees\". Drawing interest from 11 out of 16 MLB teams, he signed with the Yankees and made his debut for them two years later. Earning a regular spot on the roster in 1957, Richardson reached his first All-Star Game that year. He lost starts at second base to Gil McDougald later in the year, though, and was mostly a reserve player in 1958. It was not until 1959 that he would become a regular at second base. In 1960, he was named the World Series MVP. Though the Yankees lost the Series in seven games to the Pittsburgh Pirates, Richardson batted .367 with 12 runs batted in (RBI). He won the next two World Series, ending the 1962 series by catching McCovey's line drive in what \"The Sporting News\" called baseball's 13th most memorable play in 1999. Richardson led the AL in hits that year, with 209.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1965, Richardson won five straight Gold Glove Awards at second base. He played in the All-Star Game every year from 1962 through 1966. In 1963, he won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, and he played in the World Series in 1963 and 1964. His last two years in the major leagues, he had 164 and 153 hits, respectively. Though only 31 after the 1966 season, Richardson retired to spend more time with his family. The Yankees held a special day for him towards the end of the season, making Richardson the 10th Yankee to be so honored.\n\nAfter his playing career, Richardson coached college teams for several years. He led the University of South Carolina to its first College World Series in 1975 and laid the groundwork for their later success. In 1986, he led Coastal Carolina University's baseball team to a Big South Conference championship, and he coached at Liberty University from 1987 through 1990. Richardson ran for the United States House of Representatives in South Carolina's 5th congressional district as a Republican in 1976 but lost to incumbent Kenneth Holland. A born-again Christian, Richardson was involved in many Christian organizations during and after his career. He spoke at the White House in 1970 as a representative of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, appeared in five Billy Graham Crusades, and frequently speaks at churches and other organizations.\n\nRichardson was the middle child of Robert Sr. and Debbie Richardson of Sumter, South Carolina. He had two sisters, Inez (older) and Willie Ann (younger). Richardson Marble and Granite Works in Sumter was managed by Robert Sr., who also owned some of the interest in the company.\n\nEver since seeing \"Pride of the Yankees\", released in 1942, Richardson had dreamed of playing for the New York Yankees. Growing up, he practiced his baseball skills with Harry Stokes, a boy in his neighborhood seven years his senior who would play catch with him. Richardson played on a local YMCA/Salvation Army team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local Kiwanis Club and American Legion. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was Fred Hutchinson, who would later manage the Cincinnati Reds when Richardson faced them in the 1961 World Series. Hutchinson and Richardson became American Legion champions in 1952, Richardson's junior year of high school. Hutchinson also coached Richardson at Edmunds High School.\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Georgia Tech University offered Richardson baseball scholarships, and 11 out of 16 Major League Baseball (MLB) teams showed interest in him as well. Mayo Smith, manager of the Norfolk Tars, a team in the Class B Piedmont League and an affiliate of the New York Yankees, scouted Richardson for New York, as did Bill Harris. Ultimately, Richardson decided to forgo college and sign with the Yankees out of high school (though he later earned a degree in accounting).\n\nRichardson started his minor league career in 1953 with the Norfolk Tars of the Class B Piedmont League, travelling by bus to Norfolk from Sumter with $85 in coins friends and family had given him. After Richardson batted just .211 in his first 27 games with the Tars, the Yankees assigned him to a Class D team, the Olean Yankees of the PONY League. With Olean, he batted .412 in 32 games and hit his first home run.\n\nIn 1954, Richardson was promoted, heading up to the Class A Binghamton Triplets of the Eastern League without having to return to Norfolk. Spending the whole year in Binghamton, he ranked among the Eastern League leaders in games (141, tied for first), runs (81, fifth), hits (171, first), doubles (29, second to Clyde Parris's 40), and batting average (.310, second to Parris's .313). For his contributions, Richardson was named the Eastern League's Most Valuable Player (MVP).\n\nRichardson spent most of spring training with the Yankees in 1955 but was sent to the Class AAA Denver Bears of the American Assocation to start the year. In 119 games with the Bears, he batted .296 with 146 hits, 99 runs scord, 21 doubles, 12 triples, six home runs, and 59 RBI.\n\nWhen Gil McDougald found himself on the receiving end of a line drive during batting practice in August of 1955, the Yankees called up Richardson. He debuted on August 5, 1955, getting his first hit against Hall of Famer Jim Bunning in a 3–0 victory over the Detroit Tigers. In the field, he was a \"nervous wreck\" as he later described, but no balls were hit to him. He started four games at second base in three days (including an August 7 doubleheader), then entered three games in the late innings at shortstop before getting sent to the minor leagues on August 15 to make room for a pitcher returning from the disabled list. For some reason, he was sent to the Richmond Virginians of the Class AAA International League this time, with whom he finished the season. Called up again in September, he appeared in four more games for the Yankees before the end of the year.\n\nIn 1956, Richardson started the season with the Yankees. However, he only appeared in five games for them, batting .143 before getting sent back to Denver May 13. With the Bears, he ranked among the American Association leaders in batting average (.328, third), runs scored (102, sixth), hits (175, fourth), doubles (30, ninth), and triples (12, tied with Willie Kirkland for second behind Larry Raines's 14).\n\nRichardson made the team in 1957 and soon took over the second base job from Billy Martin. The Yankees' volatile infielder had injured himself in a deliberate golf cart collision with Mickey Mantle in spring training, then caused further trouble by getting into a highly-publicized brawl at the Copacabana Club in May before getting traded to the Kansas City Athletics in June. Richardson proved a quieter sort of character, if not a great hitter in 1957; manager Casey Stengel said, \"Look at him. He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he doesn't chew, he doesn't stay out late, and he still can't hit .250.\" His fielding was better; Louis Effrat of \"The New York Times\" wrote June 25, \"He has thrilled the fans with his great stops and catches... no one gets rid of the ball quicker [on double plays].\" Actually, Richardson's .331 average trailed only Mantle among the Yankees on June 25, and he made his first appearance in the All-Star Game that year. However, he batted .188 over the rest of the year, finishing the season with a .256 mark and 78 hits in 305 at bats.\n\nBy September, Richardson was losing a lot of starts to Jerry Coleman at second base. Even so, Stengel waited until the last minute to decide whether Coleman or Richardson would start at second base in the 1957 World Series against the Milwaukee Braves. Ultimately, Stengel chose Coleman, who started all seven games for the Yankees as Richardson was limited to two appearances as a pinch-runner and defensive replacement. The Yankees lost the Series in seven games.\n\nColeman retired following the 1957 season, and Richardson began 1958 as the Yankees' starting second baseman. After batting .203 through the Yankees' first 18 games, he missed 20 in a row as McDougald began getting the starts at second. Richardson started at second from June 5 through June 12 but thereafter spent most of the season on the bench until September, when he again got a few starts at second base. In 73 games (182 at bats), he batted .247 with 18 runs scored and 45 hits. Richardson considered quitting baseball that season because of his struggles, but Ralph Houk, the Yankees' general manager and Richardson's former manager at Denver, convinced him to keep playing. In the 1958 World Series, again against the Braves, Richardson finished three games for the Yankees at third base and also started Game 4 at third, though he was hitless in two at bats before getting pinch-hit for in the seventh by Elston Howard. However, he became a World Series champion for the first time, as this year the Yankees defeated the Braves in seven games.\n\nRichardson began 1959 as the Yankees' shortstop; Effrat wrote, \"[Richardson] is a tremendous fielder no matter where [the Yankees] play him.\" He moved to second base on April 18 after McDougald suffered cracked knuckles, then returned to shortstop on April 29 when McDougald returned to the lineup. Only batting .232 through the season's first twenty games, he was benched after May 5 in favor of Tony Kubek.\n\nBill Dickey, the hitting coach for the Yankees, worked with Richardson to improve his hitting. In 1959, Richardson switched to a heavier bat and tried swinging harder at pitches. Given the chance to start at second base again in mid-June, Richardson raised his batting average from .232 to .300 over six games with 11 hits in 18 at bats. He was on the roster for the second All-Star Game of the year and remained the starting second baseman the rest of the season. On July 25, 1959, Richardson and Fritz Brickell both hit their first major league home runs, Richardson's coming against Paul Foytack in a 9–8 victory over the Tigers. Batting .298 coming into the final game of the year, Richardson was the only Yankee with a chance at hitting .300. Stengel promised to remove him from the game if he got a hit in his first at bat (moving his batting average to .300). Richardson flew out to Albie Pearson in his first at bat but got hits in his next two at bats to move his average to .301, then was pinch-hit for in the eighth, preserving the mark. In 134 games (469 at bats), he had 53 runs scored, 141 hits, 18 doubles, six triples, two home runs (both against Foytack), and 33 RBI. His .301 average topped the Yankees and ranked sixth in the American League (AL), and he finished 18th in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting after the season.\n\nIn 1960, Richardson remained the Yankees' starting second baseman all season. On April 30, June 30, and July 18, he had a season-high three hits. One of those hits on April 30 was his only home run of the year, against Arnie Portocarrero, in a 16–0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. With the Yankees and Athletics tied 7–7 on May 6, Richardson singled against Bob Trowbridge, stole second base, moved to third on a groundout by Ryne Duren, then scored the winning run on a single by McDougald. Batting .208 through June 17, he hit .370 from June 18 through July 23, raising his season average to .273. Thereafter, he batted .215 to finish the year with a .252 mark. In 150 games (460 at bats), he had 45 runs scored, 116 hits, 12 doubles, three triples, and 26 RBI.\n\nThe Yankees faced the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960 World Series. Richardson went hitless in Game 1 but contributed three in Game 2, scoring three runs as well as the Yankees won 16–3. In Game 3, he came to bat in the first inning with the bases loaded against Clem Labine. Third base coach Frank Crosetti signaled him to bunt, but after running the count to two strikes, Richardson cancelled the plan. He remained at the plate long enough to run the at bat to a full count, then hit a grand slam to put the Yankees ahead 6–0. Up to bat with the bases loaded again in the fourth inning, he had a two-RBI single against Red Witt. His six RBI set a new record for most in a single World Series game. In Game 4, he had two hits and drove in another run, but the Yankees lost this one 3–2. After going hitless in Game 5, he hit two triples in Game 6, drove in three runs, and scored one in the Yankees' 12–0 rout of the Pirates to force Game 7. He scored a run in the sixth inning, led off the ninth with a single against Harvey Haddix, and scored another run, but New York lost the game 10–9. Though Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth to win the Series for Pittsburgh, it was Richardson who would be named the World Series MVP after hitting .367 with 12 RBI. He is the only World Series MVP who was playing for the losing team when he won the award. \"Sport\" Magazine gave him a new Corvette for his efforts. Since he had a growing family, Richardson traded the car for a Chevrolet station wagon.\n\nHouk took over from Stengel as the Yankee manager in 1961; he inserted Richardson either first or second into the batting order each game. On June 15, he had three hits and four RBI, including a three-run home run against Johnny Antonelli as the Yankees beat the Cleveland Indians 11–5. He had four RBI again in the second game of a doubleheader on July 9, including a three-run home run against Don Schwall, but the Yankees lost that game 9–6 to the Boston Red Sox. On August 17, he had three hits and scored three runs in a 5–3 victory over the Chicago White Sox. The Yankees lost 6–4 to the Los Angeles Angels on August 26, but Richardson had five hits in the game. Playing all 162 games for the Yankees, Richardson batted .261 with 80 runs scored, 17 doubles, five triples, three home runs, and 49 RBI. His 662 at bats were third in the AL (behind Brooks Robinson's 668 and Jake Wood's 663), and his 173 hits were fifth in the league. Defensively, he led the AL with 413 putouts and 136 double plays assisted in. Richardson finished 24th in MVP voting and won the Gold Glove at second base, the first of five straight he would win at the position.\n\nRichardson had no RBI in the 1961 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds but did bat .391, with nine hits in 23 at bats. He had three hits apiece in Games 1 and 4. In Game 4, he led off the seventh inning with a single against Jim Brosnan, advanced to second when Vada Pinson misplayed the ball, moved to third base on a wild pitch by Brosnan, and scored on a single by Héctor López as the Yankees won 7–0. The Yankees defeated the Reds in five games, making Richardson a World Series champion for the second time.\n\nOn June 9, 1962, against the Orioles, Richardson had four hits, including a two-run home run against Steve Barber that tied the game at two in the seventh; the Yankees went on to win 7–3. He was selected to both of the All-Star Games in 1962. With the Yankees trailing the Minnesota Twins 7–4 in the ninth inning on August 16, 1962, at Metropolitan Stadium, Richardson came up to the plate with the bases loaded. Before the at bat, Mantle told him, \"See if you can hit one out. I'm not feeling too good today.\" Richardson hit a home run to left field against Dick Stigman, the only grand slam of his career besides his one in the 1960 World Series. Though the hit put the Yankees ahead 8–7, they would lose the lead in the bottom of the ninth and lose in extra innings. Two days later, he had three hits and two runs scored, including a three-run home run against Orlando Peña in an 11–7 victory over the Athletics. Against the Washington Senators on September 19, he had four hits, two runs scored, and an RBI in an 8–5 victory. Len Pasculi of the Society for American Baseball Research called 1962 his most productive year, as he batted .302 with eight home runs, 59 RBI, and 11 stolen bases in 161 games. He led the AL in hits (209) and at bats (692). Richardson also ranked among the league leaders in runs scored (99, tied for fourth with Carl Yastrzemski), batting average (.302, seventh), and doubles (38, fourth). He finished second to Mantle in AL MVP voting.\n\nThe Yankees faced the San Francisco Giants in the 1962 World Series. Richardson batted a mere .148 in this Series, though he did have two hits and two runs scored in the Yankees' 5–3 triumph of Game 5. However, his glove would provide one of the most famous memories of the series. In Game 7, the Yankees had the only run of the game going into the bottom of the ninth inning, needing three outs to win the series. Matty Alou led off with a single, however, and after two strikeouts, Mays doubled to put the tying run (Alou) at third with future Hall of Famer Willie McCovey coming to bat. If Mays scored, the Giants would win the series. McCovey hit a screaming line drive up the middle which likely would have scored both runs had it made it out of the infield. Hardly moving from his position, Richardson snared the ball for the third out, winning the Series for the Yankees. \"People often suggest that I was out of position on that play,\" Richardson remembered later. \"But McCovey hit two hard ground balls to me earlier in the Series, so I played where I thought he would hit the ball.\" McCovey still had bad memories of it years later. \"I broke in with a 4-for-4 my rookie year against a Hall of Fame pitcher, Robin Roberts,\" he recalled. \"I hit more grand slams [18] than anybody in National League history. I hit more home runs [521] than any lefthanded hitter in the National League. But that out is what many people remember about me...I would rather be remembered as the guy who hit the ball six inches over Bobby Richardson's head.\" \"Sporting News\" ranked the catch the 13th most memorable moment in baseball history in 1999, and Charles Schulz famously referenced it in a \"Peanuts\" comic strip, where Charlie Brown yells, \"Why couldn’t McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?\"\n\nOn April 23, 1963, Richardson had three hits, two RBI, and two runs scored in a 7–6 victory over the Senators. His father suffered a stroke in May, then died on July 17. Richardson missed 11 games during the year visiting him and helping get his affairs in order. He had a season high of four hits in a game twice in quick succession, on July 4 in the first game of a doubleheader and on July 6. He again represented the Yankees in the All-Star Game. On September 5, he singled against Steve Ridzik, stole second base, and scored on a Roger Maris hit due to an error by shortstop Ed Brinkman to tie a game with the Senators at 2 in the sixth inning. The Yankees went on to win 3–2 in 12 innings. After setting a career high with eight home runs the year before, Richardson hit three in 1963, all in Yankee losses. In 151 games, Richardson batted .265 with 72 runs scored and 48 RBI. He led the league in at bats (630) for the second year in a row, finished seventh with 167 hits and tied three other players for seventh with 15 stolen bases. Richardson again garnered AL MVP votes, finishing tenth this time. He won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, given by Gehrig's Columbia University fraternity to the major leaguer who best demonstrates Gehrig's character.\n\nIn Game 1 of the 1963 World Series, which the Los Angeles Dodgers swept in four games, Richardson struck out three times against Sandy Koufax—his only three-strikeout game in 1,448 regular-season/World Series games. (Koufax would finish with 15 strikeouts, then a World Series single-game record.) Just that regular season, Richardson had struck out only 22 times in 630 at-bats. He had a mere three hits in the World Series but played each game; Richardson had now played in 23 straight World Series games dating back to 1960.\n\nOn May 10, 1964, Richardson had five hits and scored three runs in a 12–2 victory over the Indians. Less than a month later, he had five hits on June 4 in a 9–7 victory over the Twins. He picked up his 1,000th hit on June 12 with a line drive to left field against Frank Baumann in a 6–1 victory over the White Sox in the first game of a doubleheader. The hit had proved difficult to come by for Richardson, who had put the ball in play seven times in his last two games without reaching base safely. Once again, he was selected to the All-Star Game. In the first game of a doubleheader on July 26, he had three hits, including a two-RBI single against Mickey Lolich and a solo home run against Terry Fox in an 11–6 victory over the Tigers. In 159 games, he batted .267 with four home runs, 50 RBI, and 11 stolen bases. For the third year in the row, he led the AL in at bats with 679. He also led the league with 148 singles, ranked third in the league with 181 hits (behind Tony Oliva's 217 and B. Robinson's 294), and tied Bob Allison for ninth in the AL with 90 runs scored. He finished 17th in AL MVP voting after the season.\n\nIn the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Richardson set a World Series record with 13 hits; this record has since been tied by Lou Brock and Marty Barrett in the 1968 and 1986 World Series, respectively. However, batting against Cardinal ace Bob Gibson with the Yankees trailing 7–5 in the ninth inning of Game 7, he popped out to Dal Maxvill for the final out of the Series. Richardson also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game 4, he mishandled Dick Groat's ground ball for a double play that would have ended the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later by Ken Boyer's grand slam—the four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating the Yankees 4–3. In the fifth inning of Game 5, he bobbled Curt Flood's double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without any damage. The Cardinals eventually scored twice in the inning, then won the game 5–2 on Tim McCarver's 10th inning, three-run home run. This was Richardson's final (of seven) World Series; he played all 30 World Series games from 1960 through 1964.\n\nOn May 24, 1965, he had three hits, drove in two runs, and scored two more times in a 15–5 victory over Cleveland. After hitting into a fielder's choice on June 15, Richardson stole second base, then scored on a Maris single to put the Yankees up 1–0; however, the Yankees would lose the game 2–1 in the 10th inning. He was selected to the All-Star Game once again. On July 17, he had four hits and scored twice in a 5–4 victory over Washington. Five days later, his home run against Gary Peters put the Yankees ahead to stay in a 2–1 victory over the White Sox. On August 8, Ray Barker and Richardson hit back-to-back home runs against Denny McLain in a 6–5 victory over the Tigers. In 160 games, Richardson batted .247 with 76 runs scored, 164 hits, 28 doubles, six home runs, and 47 RBI. He finished 20th in AL MVP voting.\n\nRichardson had three hits and scored three times on May 25 in an 11–6 victory over the Angels. He hit a three-run double against Tommy John on June 2 to turn a 3–2 deficit into a 5–3 lead for the Yankees, who defeated the White Sox. Five days later, he had three hits, three runs scored, and three RBI, including a home run against John O'Donoghue in a 7–2 victory over the Indians. On June 29, he had five hits, one of which was a home run against Rollie Sheldon and was followed by two more by Mantle and Joe Pepitone in a 6–5 victory over the Red Sox. Richardson made the All-Star Game for the fifth year in a row, his seventh and final selection. He had four hits on August 15, including a home run against Lolich, as the Yankees defeated the Tigers 6–5. On September 11, he hit his last major league home run against John Wyatt in the 10th inning of a 4–2 victory over the Red Sox. He played in his final game on October 2, recording a hit and an RBI in a 2–0 victory over the White Sox. In 149 games, he batted .251 with 71 runs scored, 153 hits, 21 doubles, seven home runs, and 42 RBI.\n\nThough he was just 31 following the 1966 season, Richardson retired following the year. He had decided to retire after the 1965 season, but the Yankees convinced him to play one more season since Kubek had to retire due to injuries after the 1965 season. “I wanted to take the kids to school, help them with homework and watch or help coach their teams,” he explained. The Yankees honored him by declaring September 17 \"Bobby Richardson Day,\" making Richardson the tenth Yankee to be honored at the stadium with a special day. “How lucky it has been for me to have been a Yankee. To God be the glory,\" he said to the fans.\n\nRichardson racked up 1,432 hits in his career, with a lifetime batting average of .266, 34 home runs and 390 RBIs. Over his 12-year major league career, he scored 643 runs and stole 73 stolen bases. He also had 196 doubles and 37 triples. Defensively, he had an all-time fielding percentage of .979 at second base, and six seasons with 100 or more double plays turned.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1965, Richardson won five straight Gold Gloves at second base (not until Robinson Canó in 2010 would another Yankee second baseman win a Gold Glove) while forming a top double play combination with shortstop and roommate Kubek. With the light-hitting but superb-fielding Yankee third baseman Clete Boyer, Richardson and Kubek gave the Yankees arguably the best defensive infield in baseball in the early 1960s.\n\nRichardson was also known for his ability to make contact. He struck out just 243 times, less than 5% of his plate appearances. A leadoff hitter who rarely missed a game, Richardson led the league in at bats three times. Following Martin's trade, he wore the uniform number 1 for the majority of his career (1958–1966). He led the league in at bats per strikeout three times during his career, 1964–1966. A skilled bunter, he led the league in sacrifice hits in 1962 and 1964.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Paul Dietzel asked Richardson if he would become the head baseball coach for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks. Richardson told him no twice, as he was under a personal services contract with the Yankees. However, after Dietzel asked him a third time, Richardson secured permission from the Yankees to take the job, assuming the role in 1970. He would often pitch batting practice and drive the team bus for events. Richardson also tried to perform recruiting for the school but delegated the responsibility to others after he figured out \"I wasn't going after the good players.\" Under Richardson, Larry Keith of \"Sports Illustrated\" wrote, \"South Carolina rarely bunts, often hits-and-runs and is always looking for the big inning.\" Richardson led the Gamecocks to their first National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Tournament appearance in 1974, which set the stage for what would happen a year later in 1975 when South Carolina posted a 51–6–1 record and made the College World Series for the first time ever. They advanced all the way to the national championship game against Texas before losing 5–1 to the Longhorns. Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 season, finishing his tenure with a 221–92–1 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances. Dennis Brunson of \"The Item\" said of Richardson's contributions, \"Richardson had laid the groundwork for a program that would participate in the regionals in nine of the first 13 years under [new head coach [June] Raines and would play in the CWS four times.\" In the 1980s, Richardson served as the baseball coach for two seasons (1985–86) at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, South Carolina, where he compiled a record of (61–38) and led the team to the Big South Conference championship in 1986. After the 1986 season, he resigned as head coach at Coastal Carolina to replace Al Worthington as the baseball coach at Liberty University. \"I came here as athletic director under a different administration and [Chancellor] Ron [Eaglin] felt I should resign as athletic director and focus on baseball,\" Richardson explained the decision to resign, with Eaglin saying the two had disagreed on a budget for the next season. Worthington, who had become Liberty's athletic director, served as pitching coach under Richardson, who coached the Flames for the next four seasons before retiring in 1990.\n\nIn 1974, Nixon tried to convince Richardson to run as a Republican for the United States House of Representatives in South Carolina's 5th congressional district. Later, a private poll indicated he would have been the favorite had he run. Two years later, President Gerald Ford convinced Richardson to resign from his coaching position at the University of South Carolina to run for the seat. Richardson lost to incumbent Democrat Kenneth Holland by a narrow margin. Holland was aided by the strength of Jimmy Carter's winning campaign in South Carolina to hold off Richardson by a tally of 66,073 (51.4%) to 62,095 (48.3%). His campaign was supported by former baseball players Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Bob Feller, and Wilmer \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell among others, though former roommate Kubek declined to campaign for him because Kubek was a Democrat.\n\nBetsy Dobson, Richardson's future spouse, met him at Grace Baptist Church of Sumter. In 1954, they went to a miniature golf course on their first date. Two years later, they were married. In an unusual move, Houk granted Richardson permission to leave the Denver Bears midseason to get married. The couple had three sons–Robbie (born 7/2/57), Ron (7/13/58), and Rich (8/27/68)–and two daughters–Christie (12/30/60) and Jeannie (1/21/64). In 1960, the Richardsons were renting a house in Ridgewood, New Jersey. They lived in Sumter during the offseason, where Richardson was a general secretary for the local Young Men's Christian Association and host for a radio sports show. Hunting is one of his favorite hobbies. He and teammate Bobby Shantz went gun shopping together in Kansas City in 1959, and fellow major-leaguer Billy O'Dell used to hunt with him in the offseason. His roommates when travelling with the Yankees at various times included Kubek and Shantz.\n\nRichardson is a born-again Christian. During his time with the Yankees, he would organize church services for the team when they were travelling. Friend and teammate Mickey Mantle described him as a \"clean-living, practicing Christian.\" He was involved with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) and the American Tract Society (ATS) during his career, as well as many charities. After his career, he continued to be involved with those organizations. He served as the president of the Baseball Chapel for 10 years, served on the President's Council for Physical Fitness, and earned the Golden Gavel Award from Toastmasters International. President Richard Nixon, who hosted church services at the White House each week of his presidency, invited the FCA to speak on October 18, 1970. One of four representatives, Richardson spoke on Jesus and the rich young man from Mark, Chapter 10. Concerning the young man's search for guidance, Richardson said, \"He didn't go to India and ask a guru; he didn't get caught up in the younger generation, but he went to God's son, Jesus Christ, the Messiah, with his question.” He has spoken at five Billy Graham Crusades, as well as at various churches. Richardson is a speaker with Christian Speakers 360, available to appear at events. Several of his Yankee teammates requested that he preside at their funerals, most notably Mickey Mantle. Speaking to an audience of 2,000 (plus television viewers) at Mantle's interment, Richardson said there were two types of people in this world, those who said yes to Christ and those who said no. Shortly before Mantle's death, as Richardson had visited Mantle in a Dallas hospital, Mantle had told Richardson that he had become a Christian.\n\nIn 1965, Richardson released his autobiography, \"The Bobby Richardson Story\". The story became a movie in 1968. Excerpts from the film's audio track were available on an LP record titled: \"The Bobby Richardson Story: The Exciting First-Person Account of His Own Life, By the Yankees' Famous Second Baseman\". He released a new autobiography in 2012 called \"Impact Player\".\n\n"}

It is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Suzhou.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that the name Kunshan is derived from a hill, but which one is controversial. According to an impacted version, the hill is present-day Little Kunshan (\"Xiaokunshan\") in Shanghai's Songjiang District. The character (\"Kun\") was the old Chinese name for the Kunlun Mountains. From it developed the Chinese idiom \"a jade from Kunlun Mountains\", meaning any \"outstanding figure\". This was applied to Lu Ji and a hill in his hometown was designated as Kun to commemorate him.\n\nLou county () which administered Kunshan and the area around was established in Qin dynasty. It was named after Lou River (; present-day Liu River: ), while its seat was located in the north eastern of Kunshan. In 507, Xinyi county () which hold Lou county 's former seat was separated from the old Lou county. In 535, the old Kunshan county was separated from the old Xinyi county, while its seat was moved to the north of Kun Hill, Songjiang. In 751, the seat was moved to the south of Ma'anshan (Ma'an Hill: ; in Kunshan nowadays).\nIn 1724, then Kunshan county was divided into new Kunshan county and Xinyang county (), the walled city also was halved to locate their own seat respectively. In 1860, Taiping Rebellions captured the walled city, then the Ever Victorious Army?recaptured it in 1863.\nOn 11 November 1911, the local rally announced that both of the counties seceded from the Qing court from then on. In 1912, Xinyang county was merged into Kunshan county. On 15 November 1937, the Japanese army captured the walled city. On 13 May 1949, the CPC controlled the walled city.

With the support of Duke Kunshan University, the area will host the Sino-US (Kunshan) Technology Innovation Center and serve as a mixed-used project integrating R&D centers, business services, and ecological parks. It aims to become a global magnet for technology entrepreneurs and innovators.\n\nKunshan South Gateway\n\nThe area is located around the city’s high-speed railway station, with an area of 1.6 sq km. While serving as a transportation hub integrating high-speed trains, rail transportation, and public buses, the area will develop businesses such as office spaces for lease, business services and recruitment agencies.

It was released on 17 March 2017. The film was not successful at the box office.\n\nGovinda has worked with Shakti Kapoor in 42 films. They last performed together in \"Naughty @ 40\". He has worked with Kader Khan in 41 films. Govinda and Khan were last seen together in \"Deewana Main Deewana\", which was released almost 10 years after it was filmed. Govinda, Shakti Kapoor and Kader Khan have appeared together in 22 films.\n\nGovinda and Johnny Lever have appeared in 22 films, with Lever primarily playing comic roles. Govinda has made 14 films with Satish Kaushik; they last appeared together in 2009's \"Do Knot Disturb\". Govinda has made 14 films with Paresh Rawal. He and Sanjay Dutt have worked together in 7 films: \"Jeete Hain Shaan Se\", \"Taaqatwar\", \"Do Qaidi\", \"Andolan\", \"Haseena Maan Jaayegi\", \"Jodi No.1\" and \"Ek Aur Ek Gyarah\".\n\nThe actor was frequently paired with Neelam Kothari during the 1980s and early 1990s. They have made 10 films together: Govinda's debut \"Ilzaam\", \"Love 86\", \"Khudgarz\", \"Ghar Mein Ram Gali Mein Shyam\", \"Hatya\", \"Taaqatwar\", \"Do Qaidi\", \"Dost Garibon Ka\", \"Farz Ki Jung\" and \"Billoo Badshah\".\n\nDuring the 1990s, Govinda was often paired with Karisma Kapoor. They have made 10 films together: \"Muqabla\", \"Prem Shakti\", \"Raja Babu\", \"Dulaara\", \"Khuddar\", \"Coolie No. 1\", \"Saajan Chale Sasural\", \"Hero No. 1\", \"Haseena Maan Jaayegi\" and \"Shikari\".

Govinda made 2 films with Amitabh Bachchan – Hum and Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan. He has also made 2 films with Rajnikant – Hum and Ghairqanooni.\n\nIn 2004, Govinda joined the Congress Party and was elected to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian parliament) from Mumbai by 50,000 votes over the five-term incumbent.\n\nDuring the elections, he said his agenda would be \"prawaas\" (transportation), \"swasthya\" (health) and \"gyaan\" (education). In the field of transportation, he claimed 80% credit for the quadrupling of the Borivali-Virar section of the Western Railway zone. According to official sources, he made some efforts in the fields of health and education. The Thane district collector said in an interview that Govinda had committed money from his \"local area development fund\" (allocated to each MP by the government) to construct \"anganwadis\" and solve drinking-water problems in Vasai and Virar but administrative approval was delayed.\n\nGovinda's film-star status could explain his inaccessibility to his constituents but not his absence from parliament. During his tenure as the Member of Parliament, Govinda was usually absent when the Lok Sabha was in session and he was severely criticised for inactivity. At the same time, he continued his film career while he was serving as an MP. Indeed, his career witnessed a comeback of sorts in 2007, after the release of \"Partner\". He was pilloried in the press for the combination of continuing to act in films while being generally absent from parliament, and inaccessible to his constituents. On 20 January 2008, Govinda decided to leave politics and concentrate on his Bollywood acting career.\n\nGovinda's father, Aroon Ahuja, was an actor during the 1940s; his mother, Nirmala Ahuja, was an actress and singer. His brother, Kirti Kumar, is an actor, producer, director and singer. His sister, Kaamini Khanna, is a writer, music director and singer. Govinda's uncle Anand Singh (assistant to director Hrishikesh Mukherjee), introduced him in \"Tan-Badan\". Singh's sister-in-law Sunita Munjal fell in love with Govinda at this time, and they were married on 11 March 1987. Their marriage was a secret for four years. They have two children: daughter Tina Ahuja and son Yashvardhan. Tina made her Bollywood debut in the 2015 \"Second Hand Husband\".\n\nGovinda has six nephews and two nieces in the entertainment industry: actors Vinay Anand, Krishna Abhishek, Aryan, Arjun Singh, Ragini Khanna, Amit Khanna, Aarti Singh and director Janmendra Kumar Ahuja alias Dumpy. Govinda's brother-in-law, Devendra Sharma, has appeared in several Hindi films (see Govinda family).\n\nGovinda was seriously injured on 5 January 1994 while travelling to a studio for the shooting of \"Khuddar\". The actor's car collided with another car, and he sustained head injuries. Although he was bleeding profusely, Govinda did not cancel the shoot; after seeing a doctor, he worked until midnight.\n\nIn January 2008, Govinda slapped a struggling actor, Santosh Rai, on the set of \"Money Hai Toh Honey Hai\" at Filmistan Studio in Mumbai. On 5 February 2009, Rai filed a complaint against Govinda, accusing him of assault and crime, in the Borivali Magistrate Court. In 2013, the court ruled against Rai. In 2014, Rai took his case to the Supreme Court. He said that he had come to Mumbai to become an actor, and felt very humiliated when he was slapped by Govinda. According to Rai, he had contested the case for six years and had spent ₹500,000–600,000 on attorney fees. Since the actor did not apologise, he was more determined to fight him in court. In December 2015, the Supreme Court asked Govinda to apologise to Rai for slapping him and settle the whole matter out of the court immediately in the span of two weeks. The actor said that he \"respects\" the court's decision, and will decide when he receives it in writing.\n\nIn 1999, Govinda was voted the world's tenth-greatest star of stage or screen in a BBC News Online poll. In July 2016, he was recognised as Actor of the Decade at the India Leadership Conclave in Mumbai.\n\nGovinda has worked with music directors Anand Milind and Anand Raj Anand and playback singer Udit Narayan. Narayan has sung more than 100 songs for Govinda in more than 50 films, the greatest number of films and songs he has sung for a particular actor. Other singers associated with Govinda include Amit Kumar, Kumar Sanu, Vinod Rathod, Abhijeet Bhattacharya and Sonu Nigam. Also, his elder brother Kirti Kumar has sung 2 songs for him. In the film \"Farz Ki Jung\" (1989) there was a popular song \"Phool Ka Shabab Kya, Husn Mahatab Kya...\" which was sung by Late Mohammed Rafi picturized on Govinda.\n\nHis first album, \"Govinda\", was released in 1998. In November 2013 Govinda released his second album, \"Gori Tere Naina\", with actress Pooja Bose. Govinda also wrote lyrics.\n"}
{"id": "1839093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839093", "title": "Jaan Tõnisson", "text": "Jaan Tõnisson\n\nJaan Tõnisson (; , near Tänassilma – 1941?, in Tallinn?) was an Estonian statesman, serving as the Prime Minister of Estonia twice during 1919 to 1920, as State Elder (head of state and government) from 1927 to 1928 and in 1933, and as Foreign Minister of Estonia from 1931 to 1932.\n\nTõnisson was born on near Tänassilma, Viiratsi Parish, Viljandi County, then part of the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire. He grew up during the Estonian national awakening, being inspired by nationalist ideas already in his childhood.\n\nTõnisson studied in the parish school and later also in high school of Viljandi. He went on to study law at the University of Tartu, where he joined the young fraternal Estonian Students' Society, a group which played an important role in the national movement in the late 19th and early 20th century. Tõnisson became the chairman of the society, acquainting him with Villem Reimann, leader of the national movement of that time.\n\nRussification policy had closed several Estonian organizations and prominent students, including Jaan Tõnisson, started speaking up, finding support among ethnic Estonians.\n\nIn 1893 Tõnisson became the editor of the biggest Estonian daily \"Postimees\". With the help of Tõnisson, the Tartu Renaissance, a period when Estonians sought to weaken the russification policy. In 1896, Tõnisson, along with several of his closest associates, bought the newspaper \"Postimees\" turning it into the tribune of the national movement for the decades to follow. Tõnisson supported nationalism, that would stand on strong moral grounds and wouldn't seek to conquer other nations. In his mind, a nation would have to grow strong in spirit.\n\nTõnisson also fought for the development of the Estonian economy, paying special attention to the joint activities, such as the establishing of the first agricultural co-operatives in Estonia, also the Estonian Loan and Savings Society was founded after his initiative.\n\nIn 1901, Konstantin Päts founded the second Estonian daily newspaper, starting a political rivalry not only between \"Postimees\" and the new \"Teataja\", but also between Jaan Tõnisson and Konstantin Päts themselves. Tõnisson was to lead the \"moralist\" and Päts the \"economic\" fraction of the national movement. Both tried to become leading national figures, Tõnisson was ideological and nationalist, Päts emphasized the importance of economic activity.\n\nWhile Tõnisson did not approve of Estonians participating in the Revolution of 1905, it did not prevent him from passionately protesting against the punishment actions in Estonia, organized by the imperial powers. Lacking support for Estonians participating in the revolution, Tõnisson got into conflicts with more radical Estonian politicians. This however saved him from having to go to exile, as did Konstantin Päts and Otto Strandman.\n\nFollowing the revolution, Emperor Nicholas II was forced to give citizens certain political freedoms. Tõnisson used the October Manifesto to widen the rights of Estonians, establishing the first Estonian political party – Estonian National Progress Party (\"Eesti Rahvuslik Eduerakond\" – \"ERE\"; or \"Eesti Rahvameelne Eduerakond\" – Estonian Progressive People's Party) together with Villem Reiman. The party supported improving the nationalist and liberal ideas and constitutional rights. The platform was similar to the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) of Russia, with minor differences in agricultural and nationality issues. It was seen as having moderate policies for not supporting the revolution, but still wanted ethnic Estonians to have equal rights with Russians and Baltic Germans and wanted Russia to be a constitutional monarchy. Unlike more radical political groups, the National Progress Party remained legal also after the Revolution had been forced down.\n\nIn December 1905, Tõnisson organised the gathering of Estonian representatives in Tartu. Soon after its first meeting, many representatives supported Jaan Teemant, who was a keen supporter of the revolution, to be the chairman of the meeting instead of the more moderate Tõnisson. Teemant won the election overwhelmingly, but Tõnisson refused to leave. Eventually, Tõnisson and his moderate supporters left the gathering, while the remaining representatives turned the meeting into a discussion about how to take revolutionary power, much to the dismay of even Jaan Teemant.\n\nIn 1906, the National Progress Party saw great support and Tõnisson was among the four Estonian politicians to be elected to the First State Duma in 1906, where he joined the Autonomist-Federalist group. Tõnisson was elected to the board of this group and he organized a separate Baltic fraction for the group. He also joined the protest movement against the actions of the Russian government, trying to protect the new rights that the Emperor was trying to take back.\n\nOn 23 June 1906, Tõnisson and 177 other members of the State Duma signed \"Vyborg Appeal\", calling for disobedience, in protest against the dissolution of the State Duma. Tõnisson was removed from the \"Postimees\" board (he resumed shortly afterwards) and in December 1907, he was put on trial. Tõnisson was sentenced to three months in Tartu prison. Prison did not inhibit Tõnisson's political activity. In the years following the revolution he concentrated on developing the Estonian school system, founding school societies all over the country and opening several Estonian-language high schools. The co-operation and agriculture policies, that Tõnisson had established, developed quickly, creating an Estonian civil society and influencing the general growth of wealth in Estonia. In 1915, Jaan Tõnisson and Jaan Raamot initiated the creation of Northern Baltic Committee for the protection of war refugees. Tõnisson serves as chairman of the committee until 1917, hoping to get closer to administrative power.\n\nFollowing the February Revolution, Estonians quickly reacted and gained the rights to autonomy and to form a national army from the Russian Provisional Government. In March 1917, Tõnisson met with Prime Minister of Russia Georgy Lvov, who however couldn't promise autonomy and said that the Russian Provincial Assembly. In the debates about the autonomy, Tõnisson supported the current division of Estonia with two governorates, only with autonomy for each. Konstantin Päts's idea of a single Autonomous Governorate of Estonia went through and Tõnisson, among some other Estonian politicians, was chosen to compose the draft of self-government reform. Tõnisson was often among the few politicians, who contacted directly with the Russian Provisional Government in these questions. Eventually, the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia was created and Tõnisson was elected to the Estonian Provincial Assembly (\"Maapäev\") in 1917. His party, renamed to Estonian Democratic Party (\"Eesti Demokraatlik Erakond\" – \"EDE\"), achieved 7 of the 55 seats.\n\nAt first, Tõnisson proposed the idea of a Scandinavian superstate, that eventually involved into supporting total secession from Russia. However, in late autumn 1917, Tõnisson was among the first Estonian politicians, who started demanding full independence for Estonia. After the October Revolution, local communists disbanded the Provincial Assembly. On 28 November 1917, most of its members met in Toompea Castle and declared the assembly to be the highest legitimate power in Estonia. In a speech in the parliament, Tõnisson emphasized the situation of anarchy in Russia and supported the declaration, that eventually turned into a successful \"coup d'etat\".\n\nSubsequently, Tõnisson was arrested by Bolshevik forces on 4 December 1917 for organizing a pro-Provincial Assembly meeting in Tartu. He was forced out of the country on 8 December. The Council of Elders of the assembly came together underground and decided to make him an Estonian delegate to Stockholm to find support for Estonian independence, or at least for its autonomy. Tõnisson and other members of the Russian Provincial Assembly were named Estonian delegates abroad and Tõnisson became the leader of Estonian Foreign Delegations, a position that would still be his when Estonia declared its independence on 24 February 1918. The delegations were eventually turned into embassies and in Stockholm, Tõnisson met with German and French ambassadors to find support for Estonian independence, but was later sent to Copenhagen, though several Estonian delegates eventually gathered in Stockholm. On 16 March 1918, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs agreed to meet the delegates, but didn't grant any support. After the German Occupation of Estonia had ended, Tõnisson returned to Estonia on 16 November 1918.\n\nFrom 12 November 1918, Tõnisson served as Minister without portfolio and from 27 November 1918 to 9 May 1919 as Minister plenipotentiary abroad of the Estonian Provisional Government, led by Konstantin Päts. Tõnisson's offices sent him abroad again, this time to Finland to seek weaponry and loans in the coming War of Independence. He was also part of the Estonian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference.\n\nFor the elections to the Estonian Constituent Assembly, Tõnisson had yet again transformed his party, this time to the Estonian People's Party. In the elections of the Constituent Assembly in spring 1919, the centre-right (conservative-liberal) People's Party took 25 of the 120 seats, fewer than the Estonian Social Democratic Workers' Party (ESDTP) and the Labour Party. The shape of the new republic was to be determined by parties of the left and parties of the centre, including Tõnisson's People's Party.\n\nOn 18 November 1919, Tõnisson became the Prime Minister of Estonia. Already on the next day, the government decided, that Estonia would start peace negotiations with Russia and on 2 February 1920, the Tartu Peace Treaty was signed, ending the War of Independence. With the treaty, Estonia and Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the first countries to recognize each other's independence. Several countries at Russia's border and also in the West reacted negatively on Estonia's decision to sign peace with Soviet Russia. In December 1920, relations with Latvia deteriorated, when Estonia forced Latvian administration out of the border town of Valga (Valka). Through British mediation, the conflict was resolved and Valga was divided between the two countries.\n\nThe coalition consisted of the three major parties in the parliament: Tõnisson's People's Party with the social democratic ESDTP and the centre-left Labour Party. On 1 July 1920, ESDTP left the coalition because of ideological differences and the entire cabinet fell on 28 July 1920, after Tõnisson failed to find a new coalition partner.\n\nA new head of government was hard to find. Members of the Labour Party failed in the attempt to find support and another member of the People's Party, Ado Birk was chosen to head the new cabinet. He however, also didn't get the support of the Constituent Assembly and his cabinet was in office only nominally for three days. From 30 July 1920 to 26 October 1920, Jaan Tõnisson headed his second cabinet as Prime Minister in the one-party coalition.\n\nThe Estonian People's Party quickly lost its popularity and became one of the smallest parties in the parliament, getting only 10 in the 1920 elections, 8 in the 1923 elections and the 1926 elections and 9 of the 101 seats in the 1929 elections. Tõnisson himself however remained popular and despite the few seats in the Riigikogu, the Estonian People's Party was a coalition member in nine of the twelve cabinets between 1920 and 1932. A prominent member of the People's Party, Jüri Jaakson, was even State Elder of the grand coalition cabinet after the Communist coup attempt from 1924 to 1925. From 7 June 1923 to 27 May 1925, Tõnisson served as the President (speaker) of the Riigikogu.\n\nJaan Tõnisson formed his third cabinet on 9 December 1927, for the first time as State Elder. It was another wide coalition with the Labour Party, Settlers' party and Farmers' Assemblies. The government fell on 4 December 1928.\n\nTõnisson returned to big politics on 12 February 1931, when he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Konstantin Päts's cabinet. During the early 1930s, political climate in Estonia changed. In October 1931, the Christian People's Party merged into the Estonian People's Party which joined with the Labour Party to form the National Centre Party in early 1932. Three major parties had emerged in the Riigikogu, the left-wing Estonian Socialist Workers' Party, the center-right National Centre Party and the right-wing Union of Settlers and Smallholders. Päts's cabinet resigned, but Tõnisson remained in the same office also in Jaan Teemant's cabinet until it also resigned on 19 July 1932.\n\nThe 1932 elections brought the National Centre Party 23 of the 101 seats in the Riigikogu, making it the second biggest party in the parliament. Tõnisson then served again as the President (speaker) of the Riigikogu from 19 July 1932 to 18 May 1933.\n\nDue to economical differences, the National Centre Party had left the governing coalition and Jaan Tõnisson formed his fourth cabinet on 18 May 1933. The refounded Settlers' Party, that had again seceded from the Union of Settlers and Smallholders, was the only coalition partner for the People's Party.\n\nDecisions of Tõnisson's government during the financial crisis in 1932 led to a total decline in his personal popularity, though the policies would help the state out of the crisis. In a referendum in 1933, the voters adopted an authoritarian constitution, which would lead to Konstantin Päts coming to power in 1934. Päts soon suspended the activities of both the political parties and the parliament also imposed limits to civil liberty, disbanding the parliament in 1934 and all political parties in 1935.\n\nWith the changing situation in Estonia, Tõnisson became the leader of the democratic opposition. As a result, the government expropriated his newspaper \"Postimees\", though that did not keep Tõnisson from promoting democratic ideals.\n\nThe semi-democratic elections of 1938, Tõnisson was re-elected to the State Assembly (\"Riigivolikogu\"), the lower chamber of the Riigikogu, where he continued fighting for the total restoration of democracy in Estonia.\n\nBy 1939 though, Estonia was considered to be in the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. And in 1940 Estonia was completely occupied by the Soviet Union. Tõnisson tried to influence President Konstantin Päts on resisting the Soviet occupation, at least symbolically, but Päts had already decided to surrender unresistingly.\n\nIn the summer of 1940 Tõnisson started an extensive campaign, organising the nomination of rival candidates to the communist ones in the elections of the Soviet puppet parliament of Estonia. The Soviets, wanting complete control of the parliament, removed their rivals by forceful means.\n\nMembership in the parliament:\n\nSoviet authorities arrested Tõnisson in autumn 1940 and put him on trial. During his trial, Tõnisson neither regretted anything nor gave up any information about other politicians who opposed the Soviets. The exact whereabouts of Tõnisson after the trial and the circumstances of his death remain a mystery. The most credible speculation about his death centres on Tõnisson being shot dead in Tallinn during the first days of July in 1941. His place of burial is unknown.\n\nTõnisson's moral views and honorable death inspired Estonians for decades to symbolically resist the Soviet regime and to eventually regain independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. A memorial to Tõnisson was erected in Tartu in 1999.\n\n1920 – Cross of Liberty II/III\n1920 – Cross of Liberty III/I\n1925 – Cross of Liberty I/III\n1928 – Order of the Estonian Red Cross I/I\n1930 – Order of the Cross of the Eagle I\n1938 – Order of the White Star I\n\n1939 – Royal Order of the Pole Star (Sweden) Grand Cross\n\n"}
{"id": "1839094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839094", "title": "Battle honour", "text": "Battle honour\n\nA battle honour is an award of a right by a government or sovereign to a military unit to emblazon the name of a battle or operation on its flags (\"colours\"), uniforms or other accessories where ornamentation is possible.\n\nIn European military tradition, military units may be acknowledged for their achievements in specific wars or operations of a military campaign. In Great Britain and those countries of the Commonwealth which share a common military legacy with the British, battle honours are awarded to selected military units as official acknowledgement for their achievements in specific wars or operations of a military campaign. These honours usually take the form of a place and a date (e.g. \"Cambrai 1917\").\n\nTheatre honours, a type of recognition in the British tradition closely allied to battle honours, were introduced to honour units which provided sterling service in a campaign but were not part of specific battles for which separate battle honours were awarded. Theatre honours could be listed and displayed on regimental property but not emblazoned on the colours.\n\nSince battle honours are primarily emblazoned on colours, artillery units, which do not have colours in the British military tradition, were awarded honour titles instead. These honour titles were permitted to be used as part of their official nomenclature, for example \"13 Field Regiment (Chushul)\".\n\nSimilar honours in the same tenor include unit citations.\n\nBattle honours, theatre honours, honour titles and their ilk form a part of the wider variety of distinctions which serve to distinguish military units from each other.\n\nFor the British Army, the need to adopt a system to recognise military units' battlefield accomplishments was apparent since its formation as a standing army in the later part of the 17th century. Although the granting of battle honours had already been in place at the time, it was not until 1784 that infantry units were authorised to bear battle honours on their colours. Before then, a regiment's colours were practical tools for rallying troops in the battlefield and not quite something for displaying the unit's past distinctions.\n\nThe first battle honour to be awarded in the British Army was granted to the 15th Hussars for the Battle of Emsdorf in 1760. Thereafter, other regiments received battle honours for some of their previous engagements.\n\nThe earliest battle honour in the British Army is Tangier 1662–80, granted to the Tangier Horse (later known as the 1st Royal Dragoons), the oldest line cavalry regiment of the British army, who in 1969 amalgamated with the Royal Horse Guards to become The Blues and Royals. Also awarded the honour was the 2nd Regiment of Foot, or the Tangier Regiment now The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, the senior English regiment in the Union (after the Royal Scots, the senior Scottish and British Regiment), for their protracted 23-year defence of the Colony of Tangier. The battle honour is still held by the successor regiment, the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. During these early years of the British standing army, a regiment needed only to engage the enemy with musketry before it was eligible for a battle honour. However, older battle honours are carried on the standards of the Yeomen of the Guard and the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, neither of which are part of the army, but are instead the Sovereign's Bodyguard, in the personal service of the sovereign.\n\nThe need to develop a centralised system to oversee the selection and granting of battle honours arose in the 19th century following the increase of British military engagements during the expansion of the Empire. Thus in 1882, a committee was formed to adjudicate applications of battle honour claims. This committee, later called the Battles Nomenclature Committee, still maintains its function in the British Army today.\n\nA battle honour may be granted to infantry/cavalry regiments or battalions, as well as ships (see Naval battle honours below) and squadrons; they are rarely granted to sub-units such as companies, platoons and sections in the army. Battle honours are usually presented in the form of a name of a country, region, or city where the unit's distinguished act took place, usually together with the year when it occurred.\n\nNot every battle fought will automatically result in the granting of a battle honour. Conversely, a regiment or a battalion might obtain more than one battle honour over the course of a larger operation. For example, the 2nd Battalion of the Scots Guards were awarded two battle honours for their role in the Falklands War; \"Tumbledown Mountain\" specifically for the Battle of Mount Tumbledown, and \"Falkland Islands 1982\" for the overall conflict. Similarly, while in Korea, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry earned both \"Kapyong\" (for the Battle of Kapyong) and \"Korea 1951–1953\" (for the overall war). A unit does not have to successfully defeat their adversary to earn a battle honour: the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps received the battle honour \"Hong Kong\" despite the defeat and capture of most of the force during the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong, while the cruiser was awarded the naval engagement honour \"\"Kormoran\" 1941\" after being sunk with all aboard by the German raider \"Kormoran\".\n\nSupporting corps/branches such as medical, service, ordnance, or transport do not currently receive battle honours. However and uniquely the Royal Logistic Corps has five battle honours inherited from its previous transport elements, such as the Royal Waggon Train. Commonwealth artillery does not maintain battle honours as they carry neither colours nor guidons—though their guns by tradition are afforded many of the same respects and courtesies. However, both the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers were in 1832 granted by King William IV the right to use the Latin \"\"Ubique\"\", meaning \"everywhere\", as a battle honour. This is worn on the cap badge of both the Corps of Royal Engineers and the Royal Regiment of Artillery (but not the Royal Horse Artillery). Likewise the Royal Marines, although a colours-carrying service, was granted, along with the conventional battle honour of \"Gibraltar\", the \"Great Globe itself\" by King George IV for its very numerous battle honours around the world.\n\nThe practice was later extended to these same regiments and corps in the successor Commonwealth armed forces.\n\nThe Battles Nomenclature Committee's responsibility was to advise the operational Army Headquarters staff on matters pertaining to the granting of battle honours. At the end of the war, the committee submitted a report to the Army Headquarters containing:\n\nA copy of this document was then forwarded to regimental honours committees. By army orders, a regimental honours committee would comprise at least five officers of the regiment. These officers should include the regiment's past and present commanding officers as well as honorary colonel and lieutenant colonel. Upon a review of this list, and based on the actions undertaken by the regiment during the war, the regimental honours committee could then submit an application to the Army Headquarters to claim their corresponding battle honours. In cases where regiments took part in actions which were not listed, the honours committees could also submit additional claims in their applications. Whatever the situation, it was the regimental honour committee's responsibility to submit evidence to prove that the regiment concerned was worthy of the battle honours they claimed. Once the final approval was granted in Britain, a public announcement would be made. The ceremonial granting of new battle honours would be made in the form of the presentation of new Regimental and Sovereign's Colours to the regiment by the British monarch or an agent of the Crown, such as the Governor General of a commonwealth dominion.\n\nIn British and Commonwealth armies a unit's battle honours can normally be found engraved, painted or embroidered on:\n\nAs there is no order of precedence for battle honours, they are listed in chronological order, either in a single list, or in multiple even numbers of columns, reading left to right, and top to bottom. On drums, the honours are listed on scrolls, usually with the cap badge central, and other unit devices present (such as a representation of a unit distinction or motto).\n\nThe honours for the First and Second World Wars were restricted in that only a certain number of honours (up to ten each for the First and Second World Wars) could be selected for \"emblazonment\", that is appear on colours or drums. This was due to the large number of battle honours awarded. It is often the case that battle honours not carried on the colours (limited by space and design) will be emblazoned on the drum major's baldric.\n\nWhile regimental colours and guidons are no longer carried on operations by British and Commonwealth military, as was their initial military function, the battle honours they carry are held in high esteem by military personnel. Regiments take pride in their battle honours, and the winning of further battle honours, as these are seen to enhance a unit's reputation.\n\nIt remains a tradition that whenever military personnel meet a colour or guidon, it must be saluted. This is not only because it is an object which represents the authority of the Crown, but also because the colours contain a regiment's battle honours, and thus represent the regiment's history and its dead. Saluting a colour or guidon is thus a pivotal act in retaining an awareness of regimental history and traditions—key in the functioning of the regimental system. It remains common for army instructors to ensure that their recruits have memorised and are able to recite all of their regiment's battle honours. Such methods are meant to bring the new soldier into the regimental ethos and sub-culture by means of imprinting shared history.\n\nIn some cases where a battle honour was not granted, a special distinction has been substituted. For example, soldiers of The Rifles wear a cap badge on both the front and the rear of their hats. This so-called \"back badge\" is unique in the British Army and was awarded to the 28th Regiment of Foot for their actions at the Battle of Alexandria in 1801. Knowledge of that battle honour, represented by the back badge, is said to have encouraged the soldiers of the Gloucestershire Regiment in the defence of Gloster Hill during the Battle of the Imjin River in April 1951 during the Korean War.\n\nOther uniform distinctions include:\n\nSubject to approval by the sovereign, awards made by other allied nations may be permitted to be worn or carried. For example, several units have been awarded the French Croix de guerre 1914–1918 and Croix de guerre 1939–1945, the ribbon of which can be worn on the uniform. The United States Presidential Unit Citation, as with other similar citations, is similarly worn on the uniform (usually on the arm), but is also carried on the colour or guidon of the unit it has been awarded to. In the Commonwealth, three units are permitted to carry this award on their Regimental Colour:\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment received their awards for their actions at the Battle of Kapyong during the Korean War. Although their regiments carry the honour \"Kapyong\" as a whole, only these specific battalions are permitted to carry the PUC streamer that denotes the award by the United States and wear the ribbon on the uniform. D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment were awarded their Presidential Unit Citation for their actions during the Battle of Long Tan in the Vietnam War. Although awarded to D Company, it is carried on the 6th Battalion's Colours and worn on the uniform of all members of the battalion. The PUC was awarded to the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment for its actions at the Battle of Imjin River in 1951, with the tradition continued by its successor, the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, until its amalgamation into The Rifles.\n\nNaval battle honours are battle honours awarded to warships. There are two types of naval battle honours: those awarded to ships that participate in a battle or campaign, or those for single-ship actions. Honours for battles take their name from the location of the battle, while honours for actions are named for the opposing ship. These are rendered differently, in order to distinguish between the two types and to limit confusion between battle honours with the same name (for example, between the multi-ship Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, and the capture of USS \"Chesapeake\" by HMS \"Shannon\" in 1813). In older sources and on battle honour boards, battles are written in all capitals, while actions are capitalised normally and surrounded by single quotation marks (CHESAPEAKE 1781 and 'Chesapeake' 1813). Newer sources display battles with normal capitalisation, and italicise actions in the same way ships' names are italicised; both may or may not be contained in double quotation marks (\"Chesapeake 1781\" and \"\"Chesapeake\" 1813\"). The battle honours awarded to a ship are inherited by all subsequent warships of the same name.\n\nBattle honours for Commonwealth warships were initially awarded and controlled by the British Admiralty, under the \"Commonwealth Battle Honours List\". Warships of Commonwealth navies would also inherit the honours of any preceding British warship of the name. Commonwealth navies later moved to independent but parallel systems. Australia began moving away by instituting a battle honour for the ships that served in the Vietnam War, then moved to a completely independent system before 1993, to avoid inheriting the battle honours of the British \"Newcastle\"s. The Royal Canadian Navy began displaying battle honours in the 1950s, but after the Unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, new units entering service would only carry those honours earned by Canadian ships.\n\nThe earliest recorded naval battle honour is ARMADA 1588, the defeat of the Spanish Armada at Gravelines by a combined British-Dutch fleet. Because of the significant number of ships sunk during World War I and World War II, only three battle honours have been awarded for single-ship actions since the start of the 20th century: to the cruiser for sinking the German light cruiser during the Battle of Cocos in November 1914 ('Emden' 1914), to the Commonwealth warships involved in the pursuit and last battle of the in May 1941 ('Bismarck' 1941), and to the cruiser for the mutually destructive engagement with the in November 1941 ('Kormoran' 1941).\n\nAs warships do not carry regimental colours, battle honours are instead displayed on a battle honour board. This is usually a solid wooden board (traditionally teak) mounted on the ship's superstructure, carved with the ship's badge and scrolls naming the ship and the associated honours, and either left completely unpainted, or with the lettering painted gold. The size of the board and number of scrolls is dependent on the number of honours earned by a ship and her predecessors, although it is common for blank scrolls to be included in a design. Other designs are also in use: these include plaques for the ship and honours mounted on a backing board, or the details painted onto a flat board.\n\nThe British Admiralty set honour board sizes for various types of ship: for capital ships and shore bases, for cruisers and large auxiliary ships, for all other surface ships, and for submarines (the size restriction is so the board can be moved through the submarine's hatches, as it is only displayed when the submarine is on the surface).\n\nTwo educational institutions have been awarded battle honours. La Martinere College in Lucknow, India was awarded a battle honour, Defence of Lucknow 1857, for the role played by its students and teachers during the mutiny of 1857. McGill University in Canada received the award for their contingent's bravery at Arras in 1917 during the First World War.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police, although a civilian police force, was awarded the status of a dragoon regiment by King George V following the service of many of its members during the First World War. As a consequence, it then became entitled to display the many honours it had won dating back to 1885:\nIn addition, the RCMP received the honorary distinction of the badge of the Canadian Provost Corps, in recognition of the fact that the first Canadian military police unit was formed from volunteers from the RCMP.\n\nThe Army Post Office Corps (APOC) was the first British Volunteer unit to be awarded a battle honour for their participation in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. The honour (Egypt 1882) was displayed on the regimental flag of 24 Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps (Post Office Rifles).\n\nThe only cadet unit to receive a battle honour is 1st Cadet Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC). Around 100 older cadets, principally non-commissioned officers, served in the South African War with the KRRC, the City Imperial Volunteers and the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). Four cadets were killed in action. In recognition of this service, King Edward VII granted the battalion the Battle Honour \"South Africa 1900-1902\". They are permitted to wear a miniature KRRC cap badge with this single battle honour, and call their members “\"riflemen\"” rather than cadets.\n\nIn France, Battle honours, known officially as \"inscriptions des noms de batailles au drapeau\", were created during the Wars of the French Revolution. The first honour such awarded is \"Valmy, 1792\" , the last one to date is \"Koweït, 1991\" . The honours are sewn in gold letters on the regiment's flag or standard under the form <battle name>, <date> (such as \"Austerlitz, 1805\" ). In some cases, the honour refers to a whole conflict and take the form <Geographical designation>, <date> (such as \"AFN, 1952-1962\" ) or simply <war>, <date> (such as \"Grande guerre, 1914-1918\" ). Some military schools and academies have their motto sewn on their flags as a battle honour, such as École polytechnique's \" Pour la Patrie, les sciences et la gloire \" (for Fatherland, Sciences and Glory) in addition to the \"true\" battle honour \"Paris, 1814\" .\n\nDuring the 19th century, honours were limited to eight on a regiment's flag, leading to erase some honours in order to make room for newer ones. This limitation was upped to twelve honours after the Second World War. Some units, such as the 2 RIMA, have been awarded more than twelve honours, but their flag displays only the twelve considered the most important in the history of the regiment. Other units, such as the 1 RIMA, have been granted a dispensation allowing them to emblazon all their battle honours, regardless of their number.\n\nIn addition to battle honours, military units can be awarded collective military decorations and collective mentions in dispatches, leading eventually to the fourragère award.\n\nPrior to independence, battle honours were awarded to British Indian Army as part of the British military tradition. Awards prior to the takeover of the Presidency Armies by the Crown in 1858 were done by the Governor General in India or the respective Presidency government that the units belonged to.\n\nThe practice of awarding battle honours and theatre honours to the Indian Army continued after independence in 1947 and these honours continue to be listed against a regiment's achievements. Battle honours, but not theatre honours, are permitted to be emblazoned on the \"President's Colours\", which have replaced the King's colours after independence.\n\nBattle honour days are celebrated by a few units or regiments. Present battle honour days however pertain to battles for which honours have been won post-independence.\n\nSome battle honours, granted prior to independence to units for battles or campaigns in India against the local rulers or nationalist forces, have been declared as 'repugnant' and are not celebrated or held in esteem.\n\nThe earliest battle to be commemorated in the history of the British Indian Army was Plassey in 1757 which was awarded in 1829 vide Gazette of the Governor General No 43.\n\nLa Martiniere Lucknow is the only school in the world to have been awarded royal battle honours for its role in the defence of Lucknow during the mutiny of 1857. In the honour of this institution, The President of India also launched a stamp post in its name.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1839111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839111", "title": "Fuyang", "text": "Fuyang\n\nIts population was 7,599,913 inhabitants at the 2010 census whom 1,768,947 lived in the built-up (\"or metro\") area made of 3 urban districts Yingzhou, Yingdong and Yingquan.\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Fuyang administers eight county-level divisions, including three districts, one county-level city and four counties.\n\n\nStarting with the Qin dynasty, the region now called Fuyang was called Ruyin (). Ruyin was classified as part of the ancient province of Yuzhou. In the early Han Dynasty, Ruyin was ruled by Xiahou Ying (d. 172 BCE), who fought alongside Liu Bang against the warlord Xiang Yu in the Chu–Han Contention (206–202 BC), and helped Liu Bang establish the Han dynasty. Following the establishment of the Han dynasty, the title conferred upon Xiahou Ying was \"Lord of Ruyin\" (). The second Lord of Ruyin was Xiahou Ying's son, Xiahou Zao () (d. 165 BCE), whose tomb was later rediscovered in Fuyang in 1977.\n\nThe site of the second Lord of Ruyin's tomb, called Shuanggudui, was rediscovered in 1977 when Fuyang's municipal airport was undergoing an expansion. Two tombs were found, although only one contained texts. Much like Mawangdui, important classical Chinese texts were found at Shuanggudui that shed new light on ancient Chinese culture and literature. Texts recorded on bamboo strips were found at Shuanggudui, including the \"Yijing\", \"Classic of Poetry\", \"Zhuangzi\", \"Cang Jie Pian\" (primer), \"Classic for Physiognomizing Dogs\" (), tables of historical annals, studies of myriad phenomena (), a text on the motions of qi (), and others.\n\nOuyang Xiu died in 1072 in present-day Fuyang, Anhui. His influence was so great, even opponents like Wang Anshi wrote moving tributes on his behalf. Wang referred to him as the greatest literary figure of his age.\n\nIn the fourteenth century, Han Shantong sought to overthrow the ruling Mongol Yuan dynasty. Han styled himself as the \"Great King of Light,\" claiming to be an incarnation of Maitreya Bodhisattva, and heir to the preceding Song dynasty. Han was a native of Yingzhou, where he began the main thrust of the Red Turban Rebellion in 1351, initially gaining the support of 3000 rebels, and later 10,000. After entering Shandong province, the Red Turban Army merged with other rebel movements, eventually leading indirectly to the founding of the Ming dynasty.\n\nAccording to Chinese government reports in the Fuyang Party History Research Office, between the years 1959 and 1961, 2.4 million people from Fuyang died from famine. Before the famines, in 1958, the population of Fuyang had been 8 million people. During this period, Zeng Xisheng, the provincial Party secretary of Anhui, pursued large water conservation projects that led to insufficient irrigation for local crops, leading to mass starvation. Local cadres, fearing repercussions from Zeng, underreported death rates in their regions, in some cases forcing the starving villagers to hide if there was an official inspection. When Vice Chairman Dong Biwu came to visit the Fuyang region, provincial leaders ordered all corpses to be removed from Dong's travel route, and for edema patients to be rounded up and kept out of sight.\n\nAccording to Frank Dikötter, death rates in the Fuyang region were especially high, rivaling those in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. Dikötter has summarized some of the history of exceptional violence in rural Fuyang during the Great Leap Forward, carried out by local Party members:\n\nIn some cases the violence was directly related to starvation, as in one case in Funan county in 1959:\n\nSince the 1980s there has been greater official Chinese recognition of the importance of policy mistakes in causing the disaster, and the Party has acknowledged that the disaster was caused mainly by gross mismanagement, using the expression, \"Three parts natural disaster and seven parts man-made disaster.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, commercial blood selling schemes led to entire villages in Henan and Anhui being infected with the HIV virus. The government in Fuyang, which at that time was headed by Wang Huaizhong (), encouraged rural villagers to sell blood as a way to supplement their income. The blood collectors would often draw too much blood, causing their feet to go numb, and sometimes people were even hung upside down against a wall to force blood to flow back into their arms.\n\nAs compensation for giving their blood, participants were given 50 yuan along with some food and drink. Many people engaged in this practice due to rural poverty and local corruption, which placed them under great economic stress. As one woman from Fuyang recalls:\n\nIn a 2004 epidemiological survey of Fuyang, it was found that at least three thousand farmers had conducted HIV due to the blood trade.\n\nThe Fuyang AIDS Orphan Salvation Association () has done some relief work to help AIDS orphans in Fuyang. The 2006 short film, \"The Blood of Yingzhou District\", documents the many challenges faced by AIDS orphans living in rural parts of Fuyang's Yingzhou district.\n\nWang Huaizhong, who promoted blood selling in Fuyang in the early 1990s, was later promoted to deputy governor of Anhui province. However, in 2001, he was arrested for taking bribes. He was later convicted of accepting bribes totaling 5.17 million yuan, and having 4.8 million yuan of unaccountable assets. After being taken into custody, Wang attempted to bribe investigators into dropping the investigation, and continued to seek bribes from private business owners. In response, the court sentenced him to death, stating, \"His attitude was disgusting and he was severely punished in accordance with the law.\" In February 2004, just two months after his trial, Wang was executed by lethal injection.\n\nWang Huaizhong had previously pursued the construction of a large airport in Fuyang that was widely regarded as a boondoggle, costing 390 million yuan, but which served only 920 passengers in 2002.\n\nIn 2004, there was a food scandal involving fake infant formula being sold in Fuyang. Chinese state media reported that 50–60 children in Fuyang died from the formula, with the children belonging mostly to poor rural families. Fuyang's mayor Liu Qingqiang was reprimanded by the Chinese Communist Party for failing to supervise food safety, while Vice Mayor Ma Mingyue was forced to resign. Subsequently, 55 brands of cheap infant formula were banned after it was discovered they had only traces of the required nutrients.\n\nIn early 2007, Chinese state media began reporting that in Yingquan District, a government building dubbed the \"White House\" was becoming controversial. The construction cost of the \"White House\" was reported to have reached 30 million yuan, nearly one third of the 100 million yuan annual fiscal income of the entire Yingquan district. Despite being popularly deemed the \"White House\" (), the building resembles the United States Capitol.\n\nIn 2008, it was widely reported that Zhang Zhi'an (), the Communist Party chief of Yingquan District, nicknamed the \"White House Party Chief,\" had been suspended from his office on June 5, 2008, along several other officials. They were under investigation for the death of Li Guofu (), a businessman who acted as a whistleblower. In Beijing, Li Guofu had accused Zhang of corruption and abuse of power, and hoped that Yingquan District would reclaim the area as farmland. In August 2007, Li Guofu was arrested by the Yingquan government on corruption charges and imprisoned. Zhang interrogated Li, threatening his family, and extracted a confession from him. On March 13, 2008, just hours before he was scheduled to see a lawyer, Li Guofu was found hanged. Although his death was deemed a suicide, media reported that Li Guofu's body was bruised and his mouth was tightly shut, uncharacteristic of a suicide by hanging. On February 8, 2010, Zhang was found guilty of taking bribes, retaliation, and framing an innocent person, and was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.\n\nIn March 2008, an outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease began in Fuyang, leading to 25,000 infections, and 42 deaths, by May 13.\n\nIn 2017, 18 people died in a car pile-up on an expressway near Fuyang.\n\nThe most notable local dish in Fuyang is \"Ge La Tiao\" (), a spicy noodle dish made with thick noodles mixed with sesame sauce, coriander, garlic, chili oil, and other ingredients. Many people native to Fuyang enjoy this dish, but some people who come to Fuyang from other areas may dislike it and find it difficult to digest.\n\nOther notable local dishes include:\n\nThe most common type of Chinese tea in Fuyang is Huangshan Maofeng, followed by other teas such as Lu'an Guapian, Keemun black tea (\"Qimen Hongcha\"), and Taiping Houkui. Teas from outside the region are also popular, such as Tieguanyin and Longjing.\n\nThe G36 Nanjing–Luoyang Expressway goes through Fuyang, and runs from Nanjing, Jiangsu to the east, to Luoyang, Henan to the west.\n\nFuyang has a large railway station, and is a railway transportation hub for Anhui province. However, there is no high-speed rail to or from Fuyang yet. The Shangqiu-Hefei-Hangzhou High-speed Rail is under construction and will serve Fuyang through the new Fuyang West railway station.\n\nFlights to and from major cities in China are possible through Fuyang Xiguan Airport.\n\nThe city of Fuyang includes the following institutions of higher learning:\n\n\nFuyang Teachers College is the largest institution of higher learning in the city of Fuyang. The college has two campuses with over 18,000 students and over 900 full-time teachers.\n\nFuyang features a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen \"Cwa\") with cool, damp winters and very hot and wet summers. Because the weather is perceived as frequently changing, a common saying among local people is that, \"Fuyang has four seasons in spring.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1839138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839138", "title": "Bromley Common", "text": "Bromley Common\n\nBromley Common () is the area centered on the road of the same name, stretching between Masons Hill at the south end of Bromley and Hastings Road, Locksbottom. The area lies in the London Borough of Bromley and borders onto other suburbs such as Petts Wood and Orpington.\n\nBesides this well-used thoroughfare between Kent and central London, part of the A21, Chatterton Road has a number of popular restaurants, delicatessen, hair and beauty salons, the Chatterton Arms pub (the village and the pub were named after the 18th-century poet, Thomas Chatterton) and a range of hobby/craft and charity shops. The pub, which opened around 1870, was originally named the \"Hit or Miss\", presumably a reference to \"Shooting Common\", dating back to the 'dark' days of highwaymen.\n\nThe area has been awarded village status by the local authority and is known as Chatterton Village. Recent improvements include flower boxes, a village sign, Victorian-style lamp posts and a village notice board outside the bakery. The nearby Whitehall Recreation Ground has also been enhanced by the Friends of Whitehall Recreation Ground with help from Bromley Council's Parks Department with flower beds, seating, a picnic area, a wildlife pond and a refurbished children's play area (which was funded by the Friends of Whitehall Recreation Ground).\n\nUntil the 1860s, Bromley Common consisted mainly of farmland and the estates of a few large landowners. The common itself was owned by the Bishops of Rochester as Lords of the Manor, but on the condition that various ‘commoners’ should be allowed to freely enjoy their privileges on it. It amounted to about 300 acres, extending irregularly along the sides of the road that formed the main route from Tunbridge Wells and Hastings to Bromley and, beyond, to London. It was a well-known and profitable haunt for highwaymen. After the common was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1826 (the Act was passed in 1821), there was some limited residential development, but this was mostly to the south of the old common, where it fanned out from the main road; a substantial number of homes had been built around Oakley Road and Princes Plain such that in 1842 Holy Trinity Church, at the junction of Bromley Common and Oakley Road, was built to cater for the expanding population. In the northern section of the old common development was much more modest, with just a few dozen homes put up along the east side of the road.\n\nAt the heart of what is now Chatterton Village stood the grounds of Bromley Villa (later renamed Walpole Lodge), a large house owned by gentryman landowner Henry Hebbert. It was his death in 1864, and the subsequent auction of Bromley Villa, that presaged the residential development out of which Chatterton Road was built. This first tranche of development to the east of Bromley Common stretched from Chantry Lane to Johnson Road, between which lay Pope Road and Walpole Road; connecting these roads and running parallel to Bromley Common was Chatterton Road. Only in the late 1870s did the area just to the north – including Bloomfield, Addison and Cowper roads – begin to be developed. The development to the south – of Mosslea, Balfour, Albert, Victoria and Salisbury roads and Crown Lane – began around the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThe first definite mention of the Bromley area in a cricket connection is a 1735 match on Bromley Common between a Kent side and London Cricket Club. The common was used for matches on at 12 occasions between 1735 and 1752, a period which coincided with Bromley Cricket Club having one of the strongest teams in England during the career of Robert Colchin. The last historic match known to have been played there was between Bromley and London on 30 June 1752. Cricket has been played on the common in recent years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1839173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839173", "title": "Czapka", "text": "Czapka\n\nCzapka (, plural: czapki) is a Polish and Belarusian generic word for a cap. However, it is perhaps best known to English speakers as a word for the 19th-century Polish cavalry headgear, consisting of a high, four-pointed cap with regimental insignia on the front (full name in Polish: \"czapka rogatywka\", initially: \"konfederatka\") to which feathers or rosettes were sometimes added.\n\nThis headdress developed initially as a square-topped variant of a shako. In its early, compact form from 1784 onwards the czapka was introduced by Austrian uhlans, during the time Galicia was under Habsburg rule. Its use was spread from eastern Europe by the Polish Legion, fighting for the French in the Napoleonic Wars, and became popular not only among Napoleon's French and allied forces, such as Westphalia, Bavaria, Saxony and Naples, but also among the armies of his enemies. The Grand Duchy of Warsaw used them for infantry and artillery units, but otherwise they were only ever used for uhlan units.\n\nAfter the Polish lancers proved their effectiveness during the Napoleonic Wars, armies across Europe quickly adopted the concept of the lancer regiments, complete with the \"czapka\" as their headdresses.\n\nAt the end of the Napoleonic Wars the czapka continued to be worn by uhlans in Germany and Austria, as well as in France by Line-Regiment Lancers and later the Imperial Guard of Napoleon III. Lancer regiments in the British Army continued to wear czapki (described as \"lance caps\") for full dress until 1939 and the modern Royal Lancers still retains this historic headdress for its Lancer Honour Guard. Along with the traditional double-breasted plastron-fronted lancer jacket, it is also still worn by the band of the Royal Yeomanry.\nWith the end of the Second French Empire the lancer regiments and thus the czapka disappeared from the French Army.\n\nThe German or Austro-Hungarian czapka (\"shapka\") consisted of a body of pressed blackened leather, known as the cap and only given a shield on the front. This ended halfway down the back of the head and only protected the front of the head. Instead of a peak, the front was centred on the front point of a four-cornered lid on a stem on top of the helmet. On the left front edge of this lid was attached the National or cockade. There was also a sleeve for the insertion of a brush plume. On the front of the body was a metal emblem (usually an eagle). In German parade examples, a Paraderabatte in the regimental colours was also worn on this type of helmet. In Austro-Hungary they were lined in the regimental colour. A leather chin strap on chains was attached, worn up on the front of the helmet when dismounted. In Austro-Hungary there was also the Kommode-Tschapka, a lighter and more convenient version for field service for officers, without the emblem on the front and with a Wachstuchschicht instead. \n\nThe Portuguese cavalry included lancer (\"lanceiros\") regiments until the overthrow of the Monarchy in 1910, and these retained the czapka in full dress. Spanish lancers wore the \"Polish style\" headdress from 1833 until after 1868 when a nickel-plated helmet with spike was adopted.\n\nIn 1914 czapki were still worn in full dress by all Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian, British, Belgian and Russian lancer (uhlan) regiments. They varied in detail but all had the characteristic four sided top, resembling the mortar-board of academic dress. Plumes were common on parade and in several of the armies named the different regiments were distinguished by the colour of the top or sides. Belgian, Austro-Hungarian and German lancers wore their czapki on active service during the opening weeks of the war, usually with dull coloured or waterproof covers. In the case of the Austro-Hungarian Uhlans, since there were not enough of these coverings, many czapka helmets were summarily painted grey. German and Austro-Hungarian uhlans wore the czapka during the First World War, though it ceased to be worn for field uniform after the adoption of the \"Stahlhelm\" steel helmet in 1916.\nDuring the twentieth century the czapka became one of the symbols of Polish national independence. After World War I, the new Polish Army adopted a four-pointed form as its standard issue national headdress in the form of a rogatywka. After 1952 this czapka style hat was replaced by a round peaked cap of Soviet style, apart from soft field caps, which retained \"rogatywka\" style. However in 1982 the rogatywka re-appeared as the headdress of the ceremonial honour guard protecting Belvedere Palace. Officers of the modern Polish Army wear the four sided cap in certain orders of dress, although berets are the normal headdress.\n\n"}

He was the third president of Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan) from 1980 until stepping down on 8 April 2007 to pave the way for Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon. Just before his death, he was among the only four living Chinese with Tunship holders in Malaysia.\n\nLim was born on 8 April 1939 in Tapah, Perak with fifteen siblings, to a mining father and a homemaker mother. He was educated in St. Michael's Institution in Ipoh between 1947–1957 before travelling to Northern Ireland in 1958. He graduated from The Queens University of Belfast with a \"MB.BCh.BAO.\" in 1964 and returned to serve in the government hospital in Taiping and a few more places before he opened up his own clinic in Chemor, a place that earned him his famous sobriquet 'sor chai yee sang' or 'madcap doctor' as he used to play the clown when treating sick children. He was a popular doctor and he used to offer free services to the poor patients.\nHe married Wong Yoon Chuan and the couple have three children. Former Gerakan Youth Chief, Lim Si Pin is their son.\n\nDr. Lim began his foray into politics in 1968 by joining the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA). He subsequently contested in the Pekan Baru state seat in Perak in 1969 on an Alliance ticket, but lost.\n\nIn 1971, he became the chairman of MCA Perak. He was appointed as a senator to Dewan Negara and joined the federal cabinet in 1972. However, in 1973, Dr. Lim was expelled from the MCA after going against the then MCA president Tun Tan Siew Sin and in the same year joined Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan).\n\nHe became the Ulu Kinta Gerakan division head the next year and moved up to become Perak Gerakan head in 1974. In 1976, he became the party's deputy president. In July 1978, Lim resigned as senator and contested in the 1978 Perak General Elections in the Jalong state seat in Perak, which he won narrowly and was appointed as a state Exco member for two terms until 1986.\n\nIn 1980, the medical doctor-turned-politician became the Gerakan President. For the first three terms as the party head, he faced challenges and successfully defended the position at every party election since then. He contested the Beruas Parliament seat in 1986 and won by a handsome margin. He narrowly won the seat again in 1990, amid allegations of foul play, to which he has never respond. In the 2004 Malaysian general election which was also the final time he contested in a general elections before retiring, he retained his seat for a last time with a clear majority of 4,564 with a total registered voter count of 15,867.\n\nLim first became a minister in the Malaysian cabinet when he was made Minister with Special Functions dealing with New Villages and Emergency work in 1972. However, he resigned from the post the very next year as a protest against the expulsion of the MCA reform movement leaders at the time. He was then booted out of the MCA for it, where he subsequently joined Gerakan.\n\nHe made a Cabinet comeback as Minister of Primary Industries on 1986 and served in the position until 2004, when he was appointed Minister of Energy, Water and Communications. During his tenure as Minister of Primary Industries, Malaysian palm oil became very well-known and was the largest palm oil producing country in the world. Up until today, palm oil is still one of Malaysia's top money earner and job creator. He will be best remembered for bravely debating with major soya bean producers in the United States at a time when the US banned the import of Malaysia's palm oil due to the strong lobbying from the soya bean industry.\n\nHe also brought significant development to the timber industry as he worked hard and formed the Malaysian Timber Council. He also played a pivotal role in persuading Europe to import Malaysia's timber. He took the primary industries to new heights notably with the successful transformation of commodities exports to value-added products; rubber to rubber products, especially rubber dipped to furniture and cocoa to chocolates. He made unparalleled contributions in opening up the global market for Malaysian products like palm oil and timber. It was during his leadership that these commodity sectors were transformed and developed to be competitive as well as sustainable.\n\nTun Dr. Lim Keng Yaik switched his portfolio to the Ministry of Energy, Water and Communications in 2004. He focused on the important and urgent issues in the industry as he kept reminding the industry players to buck up and provide the services as promised to the people and be up to par, he had brought further development to the information and communication technology by ensuring better services from the telcos, the sprouting of the content industry and many more. He successfully restructured the water industry of the country.\n\nOn 2 September 2005 at the Gerakan 35th Annual National Delegates Conference dinner, Dr. Lim announced that he would be retiring as President on 8 April 2007, which was also his 68th birthday. Lim retired from his Cabinet post shortly before the 2008 general election.\n\nHe avowed to no longer comment on issues of the Party unless he was asked by the press. But he has in turn disregarded it and commented on a wide range of issues regarding the party, including the succession of the Penang Chief Minister position, and the ousting of a party member that was working under the new opposition state government. These actions have drawn the ire of many within the party that is seeing his meddling in party affairs a cause in the continual deterioration of the party's support.\n\nWawasan Open University (WOU) appointed Tun Dr Lim Keng Yaik as its second chancellor on 9 May 2011 to succeed the Late Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu.\n\nAfter being plagued by illness for more than a year, Tun Dr. Lim Keng Yaik died peacefully on Saturday afternoon, 22 December 2012, surrounded by his family at his home in Tropicana, Petaling Jaya, he was 73. He was given a state funeral by the federal government to honour his decades of immense contributions to the country as he was one of the longest-serving ministers in the country and a highly revered statesman by the public.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1839180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839180", "title": "Fort Douaumont", "text": "Fort Douaumont\n\nFort Douaumont () was the largest and highest fort on the ring of 19 large defensive works which had protected the city of Verdun, France since the 1890s. By 1915, the French General Staff had concluded that even the best-protected forts of Verdun could not resist bombardments from the German 420 mm (16.5 in) Gamma guns. These new super-heavy howitzers had easily taken several large Belgian forts out of action in August 1914. Fort Douaumont and other Verdun forts were judged ineffective and had been partly disarmed and left virtually undefended since 1915. On 25 February 1916, Fort Douaumont was entered and occupied without a fight by a small German raiding party comprising only 19 officers and 79 men. The easy fall of Fort Douaumont, only three days after the beginning of the Battle of Verdun, shocked the French Army. It set the stage for the rest of a battle which lasted nine months, at enormous human cost. Douaumont was finally recaptured by three infantry divisions of the Second Army, during the First Offensive Battle of Verdun on 24 October 1916. This event brought closure to the battle in 1916.\n\nConstruction work started in 1885 near the village of Douaumont, on some of the highest ground in the area and the fort was continually reinforced until 1913. It has a total surface area of and is approximately long, with two subterranean levels protected by a steel reinforced concrete roof thick resting on a sand cushion. These improvements had been completed by 1903. The entrance to the fort was at the rear. Two main tunnels ran east–west, one above the other, with barrack rooms and corridors to outlying parts of the fort branched off of the main tunnels. The fort was equipped with numerous armed posts, a 155 mm rotating/retractable gun turret, a 75 mm gun rotating/retractable gun turret, four other 75 mm guns in flanking \"Bourges Casemates\" that swept the intervals and several machine-gun turrets. Entry into the moat around the fort was interdicted by Hotchkiss anti-personnel revolving cannons located in wall casemates or \"Coffres\" present at each corner.\n\nWith hindsight, Douaumont was much better prepared to withstand the heaviest bombardments than the Belgian forts that had been crushed by German \"Gamma\" howitzers in 1914. The German invasion of Belgium in 1914 had forced military planners to radically rethink the utility of fortification in war. The Belgian forts had been quickly destroyed by German artillery and easily overrun. In August 1915, General Joseph Joffre approved the reduction of the garrison at Douaumont and at other Verdun forts. Douaumont was stripped of all its weaponry except for the two turreted guns that were too difficult to remove: a 155 mm and a 75 mm gun. The two \"Casemates de Bourges\" bunkers, one on each side of the fort, were disarmed of their four 75s. The garrison was mostly middle-aged reservists, under the command of the city's military governor and not the field army.\n\nOn 21 February 1916, the German 5th Army began an offensive which started the Battle of Verdun. Douaumont was the largest and highest fort on the two concentric rings of forts protecting the city and thus the keystone to the city defenses. The German offensive was already four days old and progressing rapidly from the north when, on 24 February, it came within reach of Fort Douaumont. Fort Douaumont was still only manned by a maintenance crew of only 56 troops and a few gunners. The highest-ranked soldier in the fort was an NCO named Chenot. On 25 February, elements of the German 24th Brandenburg Regiment (\"6 Infanterie-Division, III Armeekorps\") approached Fort Douaumont from the north, as a reconnaissance or raiding party. Most of the French garrison had already gone to the lower levels of the fort to escape the incessant German shelling with large-calibre guns. A battery of super-heavy 420 mm \"M-Gerät\" howitzers was intermittently pounding the fort, damaging the 75 mm gun turret.\n\nThe occupants had been without communication with the outside world for some time. The observation cupolas were unoccupied. Only a small gunnery team was manning the 155 mm gun turret which was firing at distant targets. The dry moats which could have been swept by French machine-gun fire from the wall \"casemates\" or \"coffres\" had been left undefended. About 10 combat engineers from the Brandenburg regiment, led by Pioneer-Sergeant Kunze, managed to approach the fort unopposed. Visibility was poor due to bad weather, and French machine gunners in the village of Douaumont thought the Germans were French colonial troops returning from a patrol. Kunze and his men reached the moat and found that the wall casemates (\"coffres\") defending the moat were unoccupied. Kunze managed to climb inside one of them to open a door. Kunze's men refused to go inside the fortification as they feared an ambush. Armed only with a rifle, the Pioneer-Sergeant entered alone. He wandered around the empty tunnels until he found the artillery team, captured them and locked them up.\nBy now, another group from the Brandenburg regiment, led by reserve-officer Lieutenant Radtke, was also entering the fort through its unoccupied defences. Radtke then made contact with Kunze's troops and organised them before they spread out, capturing a few more French defenders and securing the fort. Later, more columns of German troops under Hauptman Haupt and Oberleutnant von Brandis arrived. No shots were ever fired in the capture of Fort Douaumont. The only casualty was one of Kunze's men who scraped a knee. Despite being the last officer to enter the fort, von Brandis was the one who dispatched the report on the capture of Douaumont to the German High Command. A few days later, the Prussian officer was telling Crown Prince Wilhelm about its heroic seizure. No mention was made of the efforts of Lieutenant Radtke or Sergeant Kunze. Instead von Brandis became the \"Hero of Douaumont\" and was awarded the \"Pour le Mérite\", (Hauptman Haupt received it later, too). Kunze, who broke in and locked up the garrison and Radtke, who took command during the fort's capture, received no award. It was not until the 1930s, after historians from the German Great War committee had time to review the capture of Fort Douaumont that credit was belatedly given. Kunze, now a member of the \"Ordnungspolizei\", received a promotion and Lieutenant Radtke got an autographed portrait of Wilhelm, the former Crown Prince and Kunze received the order of \"Pour le Mérite\".\n\nDouaumont, the keystone of the system of forts that was to protect Verdun against a German invasion, had been given up without a fight. In the words of one French divisional commander, its loss would cost the French army 100,000 lives. Douaumont's easy fall was a disaster for the French and a glaring example of the lack of judgment prevailing in the General Staff at the time, under General Joffre. The French General Staff had decided in August 1915 to partially disarm all the Verdun forts, acting under the erroneous assumption that the forts could not resist the effects of modern heavy artillery. After its capture, Douaumont became an invulnerable shelter and operational base for German forces just behind their front line. The German soldiers at Verdun came to refer to the place as \"Old Uncle Douaumont\".\n\nThe French Second Army made a first attempt to recapture the fort in late May 1916. They occupied the western end of the fort for 36 hours but were dislodged after suffering heavy losses, mostly from German artillery and trench mortars nearby. The Germans stubbornly held onto the fort, as it provided shelter for troops and served as first aid station and supply dump. French artillery continued to shell the fort, turning the area into a pockmarked moonscape, traces of which are still visible. On 8 May 1916, an unattended cooking fire had detonated grenades and flamethrower fuel, which detonated an ammunition cache. Apparently some of the soldiers tried to heat coffee using flamethrower fuel, which proved to be too flammable and spread to shells which were without caution placed right next to such environments. A firestorm ripped through the fort, killing hundreds of soldiers instantly, including the 12th Grenadiers regimental staff. Some of the 1,800 wounded and soot-blackened survivors attempting to escape from the inferno, were mistaken for French colonial infantry and were fired upon by their comrades; 679 German soldiers perished in this fire. Their remains were gathered inside the fort at the time and placed into a casemate which was walled off. The site is underground, inside the fort and has long been an official German war grave. A commemorative plaque in German and a cross stand at the foot of the grave's sealing wall, which is open to visitors.\n\nA French offensive involving three infantry divisions began on 24 October 1916, to recapture the fort. This took place on the same day and was carried out by the elite Régiment d'infanterie-chars de marine (At that time designated the Régiment d'infanterie coloniale du Maroc, R.I.C.M (Regiment of Colonial Infantry of Morocco)). Douaumont had been pounded for days by two super heavy long-range French railway guns named \"Alsace\" and \"Lorraine\", emplaced at Baleycourt, south-west of Verdun. Douaumont had become untenable under their fire and was in the process of being evacuated when it was recaptured. Millions of smaller shells had been fired at the fort since its capture by the Germans to little avail and tens of thousands of men had died in attempts to recapture it.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1839181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839181", "title": "Roquemaure, Gard", "text": "Roquemaure, Gard\n\nRoquemaure (Provençal: \"Recamaulo\") is a small town and commune in the Gard department of southern France. The town lies north of Avignon on the right bank of the Rhône. In the 2012 census the commune had a population of 5,421.\n\nRoquemaure was the site of a royal castle during the medieval period but after the French Revolution the castle was dismantled and now only two towers remain. In the 18th century Roquemaure was the centre of attempts to regulate the production of wine in the area and the term \"Côte du Rhône\" was coined. The town is infamous for being the site where phylloxera, a pest of grapevines, was introduced into France from North America in the 1860s. Viticulture is still an important activity in the commune. Several types of wine are produced including some classified as Côtes du Rhône Appellation d'origine contrôlée.\n\nRoquemaure lies on the right (west) bank of the Rhône, at the eastern end of a narrow limestone ridge, the Montagne de Saint Geniès, that rises abruptly from the flat alluvial plain and extends for in an east-west direction. The town is north of Avignon, south-southeast of Orange and west of Châteauneuf-du-Pape which lies on the other side of the Rhône.\n\nThe town is the administrative centre (\"chef-lieu\") of the canton of Roquemaure, one of 24 cantons of the Arrondissement of Nîmes. The canton consists of nine communes: Laudun-l'Ardoise, Lirac, Montfaucon, Roquemaure, Saint-Geniès-de-Comolas, Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres, Saint-Victor-la-Coste, Tavel and Sauveterre.\n\nThe name \"Roquemaure\" is believed to be derived from the Occitan \"ròca\" (rock) + \"maura\" (feminine adjective black). Early Latin manuscripts use a variety of spellings for the name of the town. In 1539 the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts specified that French was to be used in official documents. The current French spelling is used in a manuscript dating from 1550.\n\nIn 218 BC, at the start of the Second Punic War, Hannibal crossed the Rhône with his army and war elephants in his journey from the Iberian peninsula to northern Italy. The classical historians Polybius and Livy each provide accounts of the journey, but the exact route has been the source of much scholarly debate. Roquemaure is one of several locations that have been proposed for the crossing.\n\nArchaeological excavations undertaken in 1996 ahead of the construction of a new high speed railway line (TGV) uncovered the remains of a Gallo-Roman villa and 35 burials at a site northwest of the town, just to the south of the Roc de Peillet, a small limestone outcrop on the old alluvial terrace of the Rhône called Les Ramières. The earliest finds date from the Augustan period (63 BC-14 AD). The site was abandoned during the 7th century.\n\nIn the medieval period Roquemaure was the site of an important castle that stood on a limestone outcrop in the Rhône. The surviving ruins include two towers, the Square Tower (\"Tour carrée\") and the Round Tower (\"Tour ronde\") that date from the 12th and 13th centuries. Next to the Round Tower are the remains of a toll collector's house that dates from the same period. The ruins are currently privately owned. On the opposite bank of the Rhône is a similar limestone outcrop on which sits the ruins of another medieval castle, the Château de l'Hers. In the medieval period the Rhône was somewhat wider at this point than it is today and both castles sat on islands within the river.\n\nThe first written record of the Roquemaure castle dates from 1209, on eve of the Albigensian Crusade. The castle at the time was controlled by Raymond VI of Toulouse but on being accused by Pope Innocent III of sheltering heretics, he agreed to donate seven castles, including that of Roquemaure (\"castrum de Roccamaura\"), to the papal legate in Avignon. A document from four years later (1213) mentions a tower and a cistern. The tower is almost certainly the existing Square Tower that dominates the ruins. In 1229 the castle was acquired by the French king, Louis IX, in the Treaty of Paris. There are no surviving 13th century documents that give details on the construction of the castle but it is clear from records of the money spent on maintenance that by the beginning of the 14th century the castle included a curtain wall crowned with a parapet that sheltered a number of houses as well as an oven, a large well, a garden containing a second well, a chapel and prisons.\n\nThe castle occupied an important position on the border of the territory ruled by the French crown, as at the time, the papacy controlled the Comtat Venaissin on the opposite bank of the Rhône. During the 14th and 15th centuries the castle was the only residence with suitable accommodation for high-ranking dignitaries near the river between Pont-Saint-Esprit and Beaucaire; the Fort Saint-André and the Tour Philippe-le -Bel in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon served only a military function. During this period Roquemaure castle hosted a series of important guests.\n\nIn 1314, Pope Clement V, the first pope to be based in Avignon, died at the castle when travelling from Châteauneuf-du-Pape to his birthplace in Gascony. Later in the 14th century, Louis I, Duke of Anjou was a frequent visitor. He was the second son of John II of France and brother of Charles V of France. He used the castle as a base for his negotiations with the popes in Avignon. In 1385 John, Duke of Berry entertained a Hungarian ambassador at the castle while four years later in 1389 Charles VI stayed with a large entourage. Then in 1420 his son Charles Dauphin of Viennois visited the castle. He would become Charles VII of France on his father's death in 1422. Although regularly maintained in this period, the castle gradually ceased to have its earlier importance.\n\nIn 1590-1591 during the French Wars of Religion the castle came under siege and parts of towers and walls were destroyed. Subsequently, Louis XIV failed to maintain the building and it fell into a state of disrepair. At the beginning of the 18th century the arm of the Rhône flowing between the castle and the right bank silted up so that instead of sitting on an island the castle now stood on the bank of the river near the town. After the revolution the ruined castle was sold off in lots and used as a source of stone for other buildings.\n\nA plan dating from 1752 shows that the castle was entirely constructed on the limestone outcrop. The fortifications included seven round towers of which only the most northerly tower survives. The remaining square tower is in height and in width. On the limestone base it rises above the town.\n\nAt least from the middle of the 17th century, and probably much earlier, the port was situated to the west of the castle at a position near the present car park and the Cave Granier in the l’Escatillon district of the town. During the 18th century the river deposited silt around the Île de Méimart which increased in size and eventually blocked access to the port. In the 19th century attempts were made to construct a new port just to the north of the Square Tower but the build-up of silt limited the depth of water.\n\nRoquemaure was vulnerable to flooding by the Rhône and on the southern wall of the church there are marks recording the height of the water in the major floods of 1755 and 1840 when most of the town would have been under more than one meter of water. There was another very destructive flood in May–June 1856. In 1860 the French state agreed to pay two thirds of the cost of the construction of a dyke to protect the town. The dyke began at the Colline Saint-Jean and followed the river south to the village of Sauveterre. It protected the town during the severe flooding of 1935. After World War II the Compagnie Nationale du Rhône began canalizing the river. The section near Roquemaure was completed in the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1835 work began on the construction of a suspension bridge over the Rhône at Roquemaure. At the time there was no bridge across the river between Avignon and Pont-Saint-Esprit. The bridge was destroyed by American aircraft in August 1944 during World War II. A chain ferry was then operated across the river until 1959 when the current bridge was opened.\n\nThe railway station in Roquemaure was opened in August 1880 on the line running between Le Teil and Grézan-Nîmes on the right bank of the Rhône. The station closed in August 1973 when passenger transport on the line ceased. The line has since been electrified and is now used for freight.\n\nThe Catholic collegiate church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Saint-Jean-l’Evangéliste dates from the first half of the 14th century. It was built in the southern gothic style (\"gothique méridional\") and replaced an earlier church dedicated to Sainte-Marie. The construction of the present church was initiated by Bertrand du Pouget, a powerful figure in the church hierarchy in the early period of the Avignon Papacy. He was appointed as the cardinal priest of San Marcello by Pope Jean XXII in 1316 and the cardinal bishop of Ostia e Velletri in 1327. In 1345 Pope Clement VI authorised the transfer of the parish services from Sainte-Marie to the new church and the establishment of a collegiate chapter consisting of ten priests and two canons. One of the canons was charged with the spiritual care of the congregation. The chapter was relatively wealthy as it inherited the benefices of the earlier church and gained addition endowments from the founder.\n\nOriginally the wooden roof was visible in the church but in the 19th century the timbers were replaced and the vaulting was added.\n\nThe third chapel on the right hand side of the nave is the Chapel Saint-Jean which dates from the 15th century. In 1855 a marble slab was discovered under layers of whitewash in the wall. The slab has an engraving of a man and a Latin inscription around three sides; the slab is damaged and the inscription on the fourth side is missing. The text reads: \"This is the tomb of the noble master [and] professor of both laws, Lord Jordanus Bricius, Lord of the castles of Velaux and Châteauneuf-le-Rouge, who was chief judge of Provence, and had built...\" Unfortunately the date which presumably would have been on the fourth side and is missing. Velaux and Châteauneuf-le-Rouge are communes in the department of the Bouches-du-Rhône. The stone is now set into the nearby wall of the church.\n\nJordanus Bricius, whose name is usual written in French as Jourdain Brice, was an important judge and legal scholar. He is believed to have died in either 1433 or 1439. The historian Eugène Germer-Durand when reporting the discovery of the slab suggested that his family name may have been Brès which in the Provençal dialect is similar to the word for a type of trap used to catch birds. This could explain the crest on the slab which includes a small bird above three objects that could be traps. Jourdain Brès may have been born locally as the family name of Brès existed in the neighbouring village of Laudun in the 17th century.\n\nThe church contains an organ made in 1690 by the brothers Barthélémy and Honoré Julien from Marseille. It was originally installed in the Couvent des Cordeliers in Avignon but was moved to the church in Roquemaure in around 1820. The walnut casing dates from when the organ was moved.\n\nIn the chapel to the right of the main altar is a casket containing some relics of Saint Valentine. These were extracted from the catacomb of Saint Hippolytus in Rome and given by Pope Pius IX to Maximilien Pichaud, a local dignitary. They were placed in the church in a ceremony led by Claude-Henri Plantier, the bishop of Nîmes, in October 1868.\n\nThe ruins of the Chapel Saint-Agricol d'Albaret are southwest of the town next to the A9 autoroute. The chapel was once part of a priory belonging to the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-André in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon. The word \"Albaret\" is the name of a small village that was served by the chapel in the Middle Ages. The earliest mention of the priory is when the benefice was donated to the bishop of Avignon sometime between 1104 and 1110. The bishop passed on the benefice to the Abbey of Saint-André. The records show that in 1845 the building was in a reasonable state of repair and that in 1881 a mass was celebrated in the chapel.\n\nThe chapel has a semi-circular apse at the eastern end which is built of carefully laid stonework. The choir is similarly well constructed except high up where rubble masonry is used. The two buttresses at the western end of the choir show evidence of having been modified. The walls of the nave, which now lacks a roof, are built with irregular blocks of stone. The western door, which is surmounted by a niche and an oculus, appear to date from the 17th century. The chapel must have once had a graveyard as excavations carried out in 1989 in an area to the southeast unearthed 22 burials dating from the High Middle Ages. The oldest parts of the chapel are in the early Romanesque style and probably date from the 11th century. The choir was reconstructed in the 12th century and then in the 17th century the building was restored and the murals added.\nThe Chapel of Saint-Sauveur is in the hamlet of Truel which is south of the Roquemaure. This chapel was also once part of a priory belonging to the Abbey of Saint-André. It is now a private house. The chapel differs from others belonging to the abbey in having a more complex architecture and a plan in the form of a Latin cross.\n\nThe Chapel of Saint Joseph des Champs is southwest of the town on the south side of the D976 to Tavel. Roman shards have been uncovered nearby suggesting that the chapel may have been built on the site of an earlier Roman building.\n\nIn 1384 Roquemaure was the \"chef-lieu\" of one of the 13 \"vigueries\" in the \"sénéchaussée\" of Beaucaire and Nîmes. It was the site of a royal castle and a large collegiate church with 10 priests. In spite of this, the village itself was very small with only 5 hearths. Within the Roquemaure \"viguerie\" Lirac had 3 hearths, Tavel 5, Saint-Geniès-de-Comolas 13 and Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres 30. Bagnols-sur-Cèze was the \"chef-lieu\" of a neighbouring \"viguerie\" and had 115 hearths. Four centuries later in 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, Roquemaure had 929 hearths and was similar in size to Bagnol which had 1085.\n\nWinemaking was probably introduced into Rhône valley by Greek colonists around 600 BC. Archaeological excavations carried out at La Ramière suggests that wine, or possibly olive oil, was being produced at the site in the second half of the 1st century AD. The earliest written mention of viticulture in Roquemaure is by Gervase of Tilbury in his Otia Imperialia which was completed around 1214. An English translation of the Latin text is:\n\nIn the Rhône stands the castle of Roquemaure. They judge that the castle itself belongs to the empire, which has rights over the river, while its estate belongs to the kingdom of France, which owns the land-rights. On the estate of this castle there are vines which the people call \"brumestae\", producing good fat grapes. These vines flower and produce clusters of grapes as ordinary vines do, but then they cheat their husbandman's expectation: for when it comes to the feast of St John the Baptist [24 June], all the fruit vanishes, and nothing which might have grown into fruit is found on them.\n\nThe earliest mention of wine being exported from Roquemaure is in the accounts of the papal court in Avignon of Innocent VI. In 1357 they record the purchase of 20 barrels from \"Guillelmo Malrepacis\", a local merchant. The port on the Rhône allowed wine produced in Roquemaure and the surrounding villages to be easily exported. In 1735 more than 8,000 barrels a year were being shipped from the port.\n\nThe current law for the Côtes du Rhône Appellation d'origine contrôlée dates only from 1937, but there is a long history of attempts to regulate the quality of the wine from the region. In 1737 the Conseil d'Etat issued a royal decree on the production of wine in Roquemaure. It specified that neither wine nor harvested grapes could be brought into town from outside the area and to prevent wines from a poor vintage being passed off as coming from a better vintage, barrels of wine from Roquemaure and the surrounding villages had to be marked on one end using a hot iron, with the letters \"CDR\" for Côte du Rhône and the year. The surrounding villages were listed as Tavel, Lirac, Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres, Saint-Geniès-de-Comolas, Orsan, Chusclan, Codolet and \"others of high quality\". The decree also suggested that it would help to prevent fraud if the barrels were marked with the name of the parish of origin. Another decree issued in the same year complained about the poor quality of the barrels used for the wine and specified that they should be manufactured in two standard sizes.\n\nRoquemaure is believed to be the site where phylloxera, an insect that attacks the roots of grapevines, was first introduced into France from North America. In 1862 a local wine merchant, Mr. Borty, received a case containing rooted American vines from a New York vine-grower, Mr. Carle. This case contained native grapevines, including 'Clinton', 'Post-Oak', and 'Emily'. Mr. Borty, planted these American vines in ten rows within his walled garden at 21 rue Longue (renamed rue Placide Cappeau). The following summer in a vineyard at the nearby village of Pujaut, a number of vines began to die. By 1864 Borty's own Grenache and Alicante vines were showing symptoms of phylloxera infection. All the vines in the neighbouring village of Pujaut were either dead or dying by 1865 and the initial infection had spread to the towns of Orange and St-Rémy. By the end of 1868 the whole of the lower Rhône Valley was infected and by 1890 phylloxera had spread across most of France.\n\nThe winemaking cooperative, \"Les Vignerons de Roquemaure\", was established in 1922 and in 2013 had 60 members who together cultivated of vineyard spread over nine different communes. Roughly half the vineyards are classed as \"Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée\" (AOC) and the remainder as \"Indication Géographique Protégée\" (IGP).\n\nThe cooperative produces several types of wine or \"appellation\" with each \"appellation\" having an associated set of legal regulations. The most restrictive \"appellation\" is for the \"cru\" or vintage wines that are labelled as \"Tavel\" or \"Lirac\". Tavel is a small village southwest of Roquemaure that produces grapes for rosé wines. Lirac is a small village to the west of Roquemaure, but the wines labelled as \"Lirac\" come from grapes grown in of designated vineyards that are scattered over the four communes of Lirac, Roquemaure, Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres and Saint-Geniès-de-Comolas. AOC Lirac is produced by 44 winemakers and 5 different cooperatives including the cooperative in Roquemaure. The cooperative in Roquemaure also produces a wine classified as \"Côtes du Rhône Villages\" with the village specified as Laudun. Laudun is northwest of Roquemaure and is one of 18 villages in the \"Côtes du Rhône Villages\" \"appellation\" that is allowed to add the village name. Wines with the Côtes du Rhône \"appellation\" are produced using grapes grown in vineyards designated as suitable. Vineyards outside these \"Côtes du Rhône\" designated areas are used to produce wines classed as \"Indication Géographique Protégée\".\n\nThe vineyards for \"Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée\" wines are planted with traditional grape varieties: Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre and Carignan for red wines, Clairette, Viognier, Grenache blanc and Bourboulenc for white wines. The proportions allowed of each variety are specified in the regulations for each \"appellation\". The regulations for red wines specify a minimum percentage of Grenache grapes of between 40 and 50 percent. For the \"Indication Géographique Protégée\" category a wider range of grape varieties are grown including \"international\" varieties such as Merlot, Cabernet-Sauvignon and Chardonnay.\n\nThere are three state schools in Roquemaure. The nursery school, L'École maternelle Francette Prade, is attended by around 200 children between the ages of three and six. The primary school, Jean Vilar and Albert Camus, is attended by 330 children between the ages of six and eleven while the secondary school, Collège Paul Valéry, is attended by 650 children up to the age of fifteen. Older children attend a \"Lycée\" in one of the nearby towns to study for the \"Baccalauréat\". The nearest is the Lycée Jean Vilar in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon.\n\nA weekly market is held every Tuesday morning on the Place de la Pousterle.\n\nAn annual festival (\"Fête Votive\") is held in the village around the 16 August, the feast day of Saint Roch. A travelling funfair occupies the Place de la Pousterle, and local associations organise outdoor evening meals with live music. A popular event is the running of young bulls through the narrow streets of the town.\n\n\n\n"}

J.\" Rodgers (born March 15, 1948) is an American scientist and entrepreneur. He is the founder of Cypress Semiconductor and holds patents ranging from semiconductors to energy to winemaking. Rodgers is known for his public relations acumen, brash personality, and strong advocacy of laissez-faire capitalism. He stepped down as Cypress CEO in April 2016 and Director in August 2016 after serving for 34 years.\n\nRodgers was born on March 15, 1948 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He goes back to nearby Green Bay, Wisconsin several times a year to attend Green Bay Packers football games. His father was a car salesman and worked for General Motors and his mother was a school teacher, with a master's degree in radio electronics. He was a Sloan scholar at Dartmouth College and played on the Dartmouth Big Green football team. In 1970 he received his bachelor's degree, graduating as \"salutatorian\" with majors in chemistry and physics. He received his master's degree (1973) and Ph.D. (1975) in electrical engineering from Stanford University. While pursuing his Ph.D. degree, Rodgers invented the VMOS process technology, which he later licensed to American Microsystems, Inc. He founded Cypress Semiconductor in 1982. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Universidad Francisco Marroquín in Guatemala City.\n\nAfter finishing a doctorate at Stanford, he turned down a job offer from Intel, saying that CEO Andrew S. Grove was unlikely to give him the freedom to pursue his own projects. Instead Rodgers accepted a job at American Microsystems, Inc. (AMI), where he continued working on a special chip technology he invented at Stanford, but this project was a failure.\n\nRodgers founded Cypress Semiconductor in 1982 and served as founding CEO. Cypress is a semiconductor design and manufacturing company, producing PSoCs, microcontroller, IoT, wireless and USB, PMICs, memory and sensor chips. As CEO, Rodgers was responsible for more than 30 acquisitions, including SunPower and the IoT portfolio of Broadcom Corporation. Cypress also benefited from its business with Apple Inc., as its PSoC was behind the iPod click wheel. He stepped down as CEO in April 2016. In 2015, Cypress had more than 6,000 employees and revenues of US$1.6 billion. The company had about 7,000 issued patents and about 1,200 additional patent applications on record.\n\nIn 2017 Rodgers conducted a successful proxy fight against Cypress. He raised concerns pertaining to director compensation, state-sponsored foreign competition as well as inherent conflicts of interest. After filing a lawsuit against the company in April 2017, Rodgers sought to remove executive chairman Ray Bingham and Eric Benhamou from the Cypress board and nominated Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino as directors. Rodgers argued that Bingham's role as a co-founder of Canyon Bridge, a private equity fund supported by the Government of China, constituted a clear conflict- of interest as acquisition targets for both companies overlapped. Bingham was forced to resign from the Cypress board in early June 2017 and both of Rodgers' nominees won the subsequent 2017 shareholder election against Benhamou.\n\nRodgers early recognized the value of high efficiency solar cells produced by SunPower. As SunPower faced financial problems in 2001, Rodgers tried to convince the Cypress board to buy the solar cell producer. Rodgers and SunPower CEO Richard Swanson had met in the 70s at Stanford University. But as the Cypress board of directors was not interested in saving the struggling company Rodgers wrote a check himself for $750,000. About a year later Rodgers had convinced the board to invest $9 million in SunPower and a few months later Cypress bought a majority stake in SunPower. In 2005 SunPower went public and reached a market capitalization of $10.4 billion in 2007. From May 2002 to May 2011, Rodgers served as chairman of SunPower.\n\nIn January 2017, Rodgers invested US$5 million in Enphase Energy, a renewable energy firm specialized in energy management and the production of solar micro-inverters, which transform solar energy to alternating current for the electrical grid. In addition to his investment, Rodgers joined Enphase's board of directors.\n\nRodgers also served as director of the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nAfter successfully launching a petition drive to get his name on the ballot, Rodgers won the alumni trustee election of Dartmouth College in 2004, becoming the first successful petition candidate since 1980. He won with a comfortable margin. As trustee, Rodgers’ major concerns were removing the College's speech code, increasing the budget for teacher salaries and strengthening Dartmouth's focus on undergraduate education. Following the campaign of Rodgers, three additional independent trustees were elected in 2005 and 2007. Rodgers was reelected as trustee in 2009.\n\nRodgers began winemaking in 1996 on a one-acre vineyard surrounding his house in Woodside. Later he bought two additional vineyards and, along with his wife Valeta, Rodgers established the winery Clos de la Tech in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Silicon Valley. Clos de la Tech uses old French winemaking techniques of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti to make five Pinot Noir wines. This includes stomping the grapes with feet and siphoning the wine by hand. Also, no mechanized pumps are used. Clos de la Tech combines these old techniques with high tech monitoring and measures to optimize the conditions for the crops and to handle grapes and wine as gently as possible. Clos de la Tech's Pinot Noirs have been rated up to 96 points by Wine Enthusiast Magazine. As winemaker, Rodgers invented a patented wine press and computer monitored fermenters. He also designed and built the first wireless wine fermentation network, comprising 152 fermenters, and donated the system worth US$3.5 million to the UC Davis winery.\n\nIn 1996, Rodgers made headlines when Sister Doris Gormley, the Director of Corporate Social Responsibility for The Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, sent him a form letter encouraging him to hire women and minorities on the Cypress board. He replied with a long letter defending his hiring practices and philosophy. In 1999, he wrote an editorial in the \"San Jose Mercury News\" denouncing Jesse Jackson's attack on Cypress Semiconductor on what Jackson claimed was discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nRodgers is an avid jogger and wine enthusiast. He is a supporter of several charities, including Second Harvest Food Bank, and served as a trustee on the Dartmouth College Board of Trustees from 2004 to 2012. He is the husband of Valeta Massey.\n\n1986:\n1988:\n1996:\n1997\n2000:\n2001:\n2002:\n2005 :\n2006:\n2009:\n\n1975\n\"US3878552\" – Bipolar Integrated Circuit and Method\n\"US3924265\" – Low capacitance V groove MOS NOR gate and method of manufacture\n\n1976\n\"US3975221\" – Low capacitance V groove MOS NOR gate and method of manufacture\n\n1980\n\"US4222063\" – VMOS Floating gate memory with breakdown voltage loweringregion\n\"US4222062\" – VMOS Floating gate memory device\n\n1981\n\"CA1115426\" – U-groove mos device\n\n1988\n\"US5835401\" – DRAM with hidden refresh\n\"US4764248\" – Rapid thermal nitridized oxide locos process\n\n1999\n\"US5977638\" – Edge metal for interconnect layers\n\n2000\n\"US6131140\" – Integrated cache memory with system control logic and adaptation of RAM bus to a cache pinout\n\n2001\n\"US6185126\" – Self-initializing RAM-based programmable device\n\n2004\n\"US6835616\" – Method of forming a floating metal structure in an integratedcircuit\n\"US6730545\" – Method of performing back-end manufacturing of an integrated circuit device\n\"US2004076712\" – Fermentation tank wine press \n\n2005\n\"US6903002\" – Low-k dielectric layer with air gaps\n\"US6847218\" – Probe card with an adapter layer for testing integrated circuits\n\n2006\n\"US7045387\" – Method of performing back-end manufacturing of an integrated circuit\n\n2007\n\"US7227804\" – Current source architecture for memory device standby current reduction\n\n2008\n\"US2008315847\" - Programmable floating gate reference\n\"US2008102160\" - Wine-making press\n\n2009\n\"US7507944\" – Non-planar packaging of image sensor\n\n2017\n\"US9624094\" – Hydrogen barriers in a copper interconnect process\n\n"}

{"id": "1839210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839210", "title": "Märket", "text": "Märket\n\nMärket (\"The Mark\", ) is a small uninhabited skerry in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Finland (in the area of the autonomous Åland Islands), with a lighthouse as its salient manmade feature. Märket has been divided between the two countries since the Treaty of Fredrikshamn of 1809 defined the border between Sweden and the Russian Empire as going through the middle of the island. The Finnish side of the island is part of the Municipality of Hammarland and is the westernmost land point of Finland. The Swedish part of the island is itself divided by two counties of Sweden: Uppsala County (Östhammar Municipality) and Stockholm County (Norrtälje Municipality).\n\nThe \"Understen–Märket Passage\" links the Bothnian Sea to the Baltic proper. The skerry is roughly long by wide, and its area is about . It is the smallest sea island shared by two countries.\nThe name \"Märket\" ('the Mark') probably comes from its usefulness as a navigation mark before there were lighthouses. The route between Sweden and Åland has a passage of about (17 mi) length over open sea. Before the lighthouse, the island and its shallows were dangerous navigational hazards, which seafarers tried desperately to avoid. In 1873, as many as 23 ships were grounded on the Swedish coast and its archipelago trying to avoid Märket, and eight of them were shipwrecked. Märket is detached from the main Åland archipelago, with the closest island more than away, and the closest harbor, Berghamn, away in Eckerö. There is no deep harbor; the island can only be reached with boats. There are small, barely surfacing rocks northwest of Märket, called Märketshällor (\"stones of Märket\"), which are too small to sustain vegetation.\n\nThe island consists of mostly smooth diabase rock, with a maximum natural elevation of two meters. Most of the area is regularly washed over with seawater in storms, and scoured by drift ice in winter. Plant life, which is limited to low-growing grasses and herbs, persists only in some protected spots. Twenty-three plant species have been identified altogether. The halophilic grass \"Puccinellia capillaris\" and the herbaceous \"Sagina nodosa\" (knotted pearlwort) are found scattered throughout the island. Among rarer species, \"Spergularia marina\" (salt sandspurry) grows on Märket. \"Salix caprea\" (goat willow) grows on an abandoned building.\n\nThere are large grey seal communities around Märket, and Märket has been a target for seal safaris.\n\nThere is a lighthouse on the Finnish side of the current border, which has been unmanned and automated since 1979. When it was built by the Grand Duchy of Finland (then part of the Russian Empire) in 1885, the island was considered a no man's land, so it was simply built on the highest point on the island. However, this meant it was built on the Swedish part of the island.\n\nAs a result, the border was adjusted in 1985 so that the lighthouse is now located on Finnish territory. The adjustment was carried out such that no net transfer of territory occurred, and the ownership of the coastline was unchanged so as not to interfere with each country's fishing rights.\n\nThis resulted in an unusual shape for the international border which satisfied both Finnish and Swedish interests. The adjusted border takes the form of an inverted 'S', and the lighthouse is connected to the rest of Finland only by a short stretch of land. The border is regularly resurveyed every 25 years by officials representing both countries. The last such joint inspection took place in August 2006. The border is marked by holes drilled into the rock, because the seasonal drift ice would shear off any protruding markers. Due to the Nordic Passport Union and the Schengen Agreement, there have been no passport checks or other border formalities at the border since 1958, so intra-Nordic/intra-Schengen visitors may visit the island freely. Both sides are officially monolingually Swedish-speaking, the Finnish side as a part of Åland.\n\nThe lighthouse is in urgent need of maintenance, and a Finnish interest group is trying to raise funds for its preservation. The lighthouse has been automatic since 1979 and the surrounding buildings are no longer used. The increasing general availability of GPS has made its primary function redundant.\n\nRadio amateurs around the world consider the Finnish part of Märket Reef (as they call it) a separate entity, distinct from Finland and Sweden. The Finnish part of Märket Reef used to be one of the world's most desired \"countries\" among radio amateurs due to its special status and relative remoteness. Usually there are one or more Amateur Radio expeditions to the island every year, weather permitting. During these expeditions tens of thousands of radio contacts are made with people in several parts of the world. At high seas, landing is only possible with a helicopter. Good pictures of Märket are shown on QSL cards. The official prefix for use on the Finnish side is OH0, as in the rest of the Åland Islands, but OJ0 is the optional call sign prefix for Märket Reef. There is a fee for using an OJ0 call sign, while the use of the OH0/ prefix in front of the own call sign is free. All radio activity on the island is by visitors on DX-peditions. When the Finnish part of the reef was given its special status in amateur radio, in the late 1960s the lighthouse keeper himself became a licensed Amateur Radio operator who initially used the call OH0MA. On the Swedish side of Märket Reef the callsigns 8S9M and SI8MI have been used.\n\nMärket has a continental climate affected by oceanic influences; it has a reputation for being one of the windiest places in Finland. A meteorological station has been managed by the lighthouse keepers since 1896 and an automatic station of the Finnish Meteorological Institute was inaugurated on November 10, 1977, shortly before its automation.\n\nThe effect of the sea is very important to the climate of the island: thermal inertia dramatically reduces the temperature fluctuations during the year compared to the continent and to a lesser extent compared to the central part of Fasta Åland, the largest island of the archipelago of Åland. Märket holds five records for daytime temperatures for weather stations in Finland, all in the period between November 29 and January 1, with on December 15, 2006 and on December 31, 1975. The average yearly temperature is roughly and is one of the highest in Finland, with the month of January being milder than on the continent ( on average), and a warm summer ( on average in July). The island is drier than the mainland: the average annual rainfall does not usually surpass .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1839212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839212", "title": "William Attewell", "text": "William Attewell\n\nWilliam Attewell (; commonly known as Dick Attewell) (12 June 1861 – 11 June 1927) was a cricketer who played for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and England. Attewell was a medium pace bowler who was renowned for his extraordinary accuracy and economy. On the many sticky or crumbling pitches encountered in his prime Attewell could get on a great deal of spin so as to always beat the bat, whilst his accuracy would make slogging – the only way to make runs under such conditions – very difficult. He was responsible for the development of \"off theory\" – bowling wide of the off stump to a packed off-side field to frustrate batsmen on the rapidly improving pitches of the 1890s. At times Attewell was a useful batsman for his county, and he scored 102 against Kent in 1897.\n\nIt is true that against the extremely fleet-footed Australian batsmen of his time, Attewell was fairly ineffective. Moreover, with bowlers such as Lohmann and J.T. Hearne available who could do all Attewell could, he had trouble maintaining his place at Test level despite all he did for Nottinghamshire and the Marylebone Cricket Club.\n\nAttewell first played for Nottinghamshire in 1881 as a result of a strike by senior players such as Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley. He bowled very well but did not establish himself until 1884 after Morley had died, when he took 100 wickets for less than thirteen runs each. From then on, Attewell was always in the front rank of English bowlers, and after Shaw dropped out of the Nottinghamshire eleven in early 1887 he became the undisputed leader of the county's attack. His first Ashes tour was modest, partly owing to the dry weather, but he continued improving in England – taking 9 for 23 against Sussex at Trent Bridge in 1886 – and toured Australia again in 1887/1888. He proved deadly in a wet La Niña season in minor games, but had no opportunity of showing his deadliness on a sticky wicket at the highest level because Lohmann and Briggs were so effective. However, Attewell's skill and economy, along with the brilliant batting of Shrewsbury, allowed Nottinghamshire to maintain their position as one of the top counties in first-class county cricket right up to the end of 1892.\n\nEven when Attewell became the MCC's chief bowler and increased his aggregate of wickets to around 150 from 1889 to 1892, he did not cement his Test spot, and improving pitches and a severe shortage of support bowling caused Attewell's average to blow out to 21 in 1893 – and his record of 111 wickets at 17.54 in 1894 was disappointing given how much the pitches helped a bowler of his type. Although for the following three years Attewell did remarkably well on all pitches considering Nottinghamshire had no other bowlers even approaching \"county\" standard, the great strength of English bowling meant he was not considered for a Test match after 1891. In 1898, Attewell's tireless bowling at last seemed to lose some of its sting, and he failed to reach 100 wickets for the first time in a decade. The extremely dry summer of 1899 showed Attewell's capacity to bowl and bowl all day really was no more: he took only 29 wickets at the extremely high (even on such pitches) cost of 34.62 – \"in county matches he took just 19 wickets for 38.73 each\".\n\nAttewell retired at the end of 1899 (apart from an abortive appearance for MCC in August 1900) and became a first-class umpire. He continued in this role on a regular basis until 1909, and even umpired at Lord's in an emergency in 1911.\n\nHe was the first person in test history to be dismissed for a King pair.\n\nPairs in Test and first-class cricket\n\n"}

It is one of the largest kraits, with a maximum length up to .\n\nThe banded krait is easily identified by its alternate black and yellow crossbands, its triangular body cross section, and the marked vertebral ridge consisting of enlarged vertebral shields along its body. The head is broad and depressed. The eyes are black. It has arrowhead-like yellow markings on its otherwise black head and has yellow lips, lores, chin, and throat.\n\nThe longest banded krait measured was long, but normally the length encountered is .\n\nThe snake has an entire anal plate and single subcaudals. The tail is small, about one-tenth the length of the snake.\n\nThe scientific name of the genus is derived from the Kannada/Telugu word \"bangarum\" meaning \"gold\", referring to the yellow rings around its body.\n\nThe banded krait occurs in the whole of the Indo-Chinese subregion, the Malay peninsula and Indonesian archipelago, and southern China. The species is common in the states of Mizoram, Assam and Tripura of India, Nepal and Bangladesh, but becomes progressively uncommon westwards in India.\n\nIt has been recorded eastwards from central India through Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and southern China (including Hong Kong), Philippines to Malaysia and the main Indonesian islands of Borneo (Java and Sumatra), as well as Singapore.\n\nIn India, it has been recorded from Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Northeast India, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. It has recently been recorded from Hassan District in Karnataka, and Chalkari, Bokaro District, Jharkhand and Trivandrum, Kerala.\n\nBanded kraits may be seen in a variety of habitats, ranging from forests to agricultural lands. They inhabit termite mounds and rodent holes close to water, and often live near human settlement, especially villages, because of their supply of rodents and water. They prefer the open plains of the countryside. The banded krait has been found in Myanmar up to an altitude of 5000 feet.\n\nBanded kraits are shy, not typically seen, and are mainly nocturnal. When harassed, they will usually hide their heads under their coils, and do not generally attempt to bite, though at night they are much more active and widely considered to be more dangerous then.\n\nDuring the day, they lie up in grass, pits, or drains. The snakes are lethargic and sluggish even under provocation. They are most commonly seen in the rains.\n\nThe banded krait feeds mainly on other snakes, but is also known to eat fish, frogs, skinks, and snake eggs. Among the snakes taken by banded kraits are: -\n\nThe prey is swallowed head first, after it has been rendered inactive by the venom.\n\nLittle is known of its breeding habits. In Myanmar, a female has been dug out while incubating a clutch of eight eggs, four of which hatched in May. Young have been recorded to measure 298 to 311 mm on hatching. The snake is believed to become adult in the third year of its life, at an approximate length of 914 mm.\n\nThe venom of the banded krait mainly contains neurotoxins (pre- and postsynaptic neurotoxins) with values of 2.4 mg/kg—3.6 mg/kg SC, 1.289 mg/kg IV and 1.55 mg/kg IP. The quantity of venom delivered averages out at 20–114 mg. Engelmann and Obst (1981) list the venom yield at 114 mg (dry weight). The major clinical effects caused by the venom of this species include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and dizziness. Severe envenomation can lead to respiratory failure and death may occur due to suffocation.\n\nA clinical toxicology study gives an untreated mortality rate of 1—10%, which may be because contact with humans is rare and when bites do occur, the rate of envenomation when biting defensively is thought to be very low. Currently, polyvalent antivenoms are available in India and Indonesia.\n\n\n\n"}

This continued until 1959 when Singapore was granted self-government, and the governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who was in turn replaced by the President.\n\nGovernment House of Singapore was built between 1867 and 1869 on the instructions of Sir Harry Saint George Ord, Singapore's first colonial governor after the transfer from the East India Company to the Colonial Office. The architect was Major John Frederick Adolphus McNair. Within the same compound is Sri Temasek, one of several senior colonial officers' residences in the Government House previously assigned to the Colonial Secretary.\n\nSir Harry's desire for a stately governor's residence arose from his dissatisfaction with the leased housing on Grange Hill and Leonie Hill that Governors had to make do with. An earlier governor's residence on Bukit Larangan (now Fort Canning) known as Government House, a flimsy timber structure once designed and built for Sir Stamford Raffles' residence by George Dromgold Coleman in 1822, had been torn down in 1859 to make way for the fort and was never replaced.\n\nOrd's views were met with much resistance amongst his colleagues, as to build a residence of palatial proportions and cost was deemed too extravagant. Ord stood his ground, however, and eventually acquired of land from C. R. Prinsep's nutmeg estate in 1867. Construction began later in the year after the design was finalised in March 1867.\n\nDisapproval of Ord's initial plans seemed to have evaporated by the time Government House was completed in 1869, as attested to in a report in \"The Straits Times\" on 24 April of that year:\n\nIt was completed just in time for a visit by the Prince Alfred, the 1st Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nThe entire Government House, its grounds and auxiliary residences were built by convict labour – John Frederick Adolphus McNair, supervisor for the construction of Government House, was conveniently superintendent of convicts. It was an impressive building and won accolades from its occupants, writers and visitors.\n\nA \"nearly perfect\" residence is how Sir Frederick Weld, Governor of the Straits Settlements and official resident there from 1880 to 1887, described it in a lecture at the Royal Colonial Institute in London. He said Government House was:\n\nWhen Japan invaded in 1942, deliberate shelling destroyed the small ceremonial guns on the steps of Government House and left the building and its grounds in a state of ruin. The Governor, Sir Shenton Thomas, and Daisy, Lady Thomas loyally remained in Government House with their servants until the very last moments. When they finally evacuated, they took with them the Union Flag that had been flying in front of Government House and carefully kept it hidden throughout the Japanese Occupation. During the occupation, the house was occupied by Field Marshal Count Hisaichi Terauchi, commander of the Japanese Southern Army, and Major General Kawamura, commander of the Singapore Defence Forces.\n\nThe building continued to be used by governors of the newly created Crown Colony of Singapore. \nWhen Singapore attained self-rule in 1959, the building was handed over to the Government of Singapore. It was then renamed the Istana. Yusof Ishak was appointed the first local head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, and took up office at the Istana.\n\nThe building was extensively renovated between 1996 and 1998 to add more space and modern-day conveniences. The building today has six function rooms used for ceremonial and entertainment purposes. The offices of the President of Singapore and her staff are in the building.\n\nSince its first occupancy in 1869, the Istana has seen 21 terms of governorship (1869–1958), two terms of occupation by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (1959–1965) and six terms of presidential occupation (since 1965), not to mention the Japanese occupancy between 1942 and 1945.\n\nToday, the Istana is the official residence of the President of Singapore. However, no presidents nor cabinet ministers have lived there after the tenure of Devan Nair, the third President of Singapore. The villas, which are meant to be used for foreign heads of state, are used rarely. The Istana building and its grounds are open to the public on five selected statutory holidays – Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa, Labour Day and National Day. Due to the closeness of Deepavali and Hari Raya Puasa in some years, the grounds of the Istana are sometimes open only once during this period in commemoration of both public holidays. The grounds are also often used for state functions and ceremonial occasions such as swearings-in, investitures and the presentation of credentials by heads of foreign missions. The Prime Minister, Senior Minister and Minister Mentor have their offices in the Istana Annex.\n\nThe current president, Halimah Yacob, had indicated that she will continue to live in her HDB flat in Yishun Avenue 4, however, was moved out due to the government's recommendation since the time she attained presidency, and it is where security is much concerned. The move took 2 months.\n\nOn the first Sunday of the month, there is a Changing of the Guards parade, which is a popular public event.\n\nThe Istana is similar to many 18th-century neo-Palladian style buildings designed by British military engineers in India. It has a tropical layout like a Malay house, surrounded by statuesque columns, deep verandahs, louvred windows and panelled doors to promote cross-ventilation. The central three-storey 28-metre-high tower block dominates the building. The reasonably well-proportioned two-storey side wings feature Ionic, Doric and Corinthian orders with Ionic colonnades at the second storey and Doric colonnades at the first storey. The building sits in its elevated position overlooking its stately grounds, the Domain, reminiscent of the great gardens of England.\n\n\n\n\nThe U-shaped Grand Staircase leads to the second and third floors of the Istana. On the first landing stands the Guardian of the House on a raised display cabinet. The statue is made of wood from India, ivory and mother of pearl. The Guardian was made by Indian labourers who constructed the Istana and was presented to Sir Shenton Thomas to commemorate his taking up of residence there. During the Second World War, the statue was placed in a storeroom. It was forgotten until 1995 when Istana guards were tasked to clear the storeroom, at which time it was found lying next to the British coat of arms which used to hang at the main entrance to the Istana.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the grandson of Stevenson Macadam.\n\nEducated at Melville College, Edinburgh, he was the second King's Scout to be invested in Scotland, and the first Silver Wolf Scout in Scotland, awarded for \"services of the most exceptional character by gift of the Chief Scout\". In both cases he was invested by Chief Scout and founder Sir Robert Baden-Powell.\n\nHe served in World War I, attached to the City of Edinburgh (Fortress) Royal Engineers. He was the youngest major in the British Army as Officer Commanding Royal Engineers, Archangel, North Russian Expeditionary Force, the ill-fated Allied military campaign 1918–1919 following the armistice with Germany, and the final major military action of WWI (Mentioned in dispatches [MID] thrice). He was awarded the OBE in 1919 at the age of 24 for his service there.\n\nIvison, like many of his generation who served in World War I, attended university at a later age than normal after his wartime service. He studied at King's College London and Christ's College, Cambridge.\n\nHe was the founder president of the National Union of Students, being elected their first president in 1922 when the Inter-Varsity Association and the International Students Bureau merged at a joint meeting held at the University of London. He was the then president of King's College Union Society.\n\nAfter his experience in the First World War in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science he stated his vision of the role that the NUS would play. The Union is in no way a propagandist organisation, it is an association of students for the furtherance of students’ interests. But spirit of service permeates the movement and no one can fail to see how direct a bearing this national and international student co-operation must have on the great and pressing problems of reconstruction in Europe. If students are co-operating today surely there is hope for tomorrow.\n\nThe NUS's founding constitution stipulated that it must operate as a non-political and non-religious student organisation as the factional differences among nations were felt to have led to the recent world conflict. The non-political stipulation was dropped in 1969.\n\nFrom its outset the NUS founders were also noteworthy in ensuring that women were involved at its highest levels through a constitutional requirement.\n\nMacadam was involved in the formation Confédération Internationale des Étudiants (International Confederation of Students) bringing together student bodies from the original member countries of the League of Nations, including the US, and subsequently others. The CIE inaugural conference was held in Prague in 1921. He chaired until 1929 the CIE's commission responsible for \"International Relations and Travel.\" \n\nHe stepped down as the NUS President in December 1922 to serve as Honorary Organising Secretary, which became in effect their senior executive until 1929. While still at Cambridge, he was able to obtain the financing for a permanent headquarters for the NUS at Endsleigh Street, London, W.C.1.(opened in 1925). In 1927 Macadam spearheaded a successful fundraising appeal to endow the Union and place it on a sound financial footing. He was one of the original trustees of the National Union of Students and remained one until the end of his life.\nThe main students' union building and Faculty of Engineering at King's College's Strand campus is named the \"Macadam Building\" in his honour (opened 1975).\n\nIn 2004, KCLSU President Michael Champion instituted the Macadam Cup, a day of sporting excellence between medical and non-medical students at the College.\nThe new NUS National Headquarters was named \"Macadam House\" in 2013 at 275 Gray’s Inn Road, London, WC1X 8QB.\n\nHe was the first Secretary and Director-General of the Royal Institute of International Affairs serving as its chief executive between 1929 and 1955 based at Chatham House in St. James's Square, London, S.W.1.\n\nTo enable the Institute to increase the breadth and range of its activities, he steadily expanded office and meeting space for the Institute by acquiring the freehold properties adjoining 10, St James Square (Chatham House) \n\nMacadam was responsible for numerous international conferences around the world. He organised the first Commonwealth Relations Conference at Hart House, University of Toronto, Canada in 1933 (the first Commonwealth conference per se), followed by others at Lapstone near Sydney, Australia in 1938, at Chatham House, London in 1945, at Lucknow, India in 1950., and at Lahore, Pakistan in 1954 Also various Institute of Pacific Relations Conferences, including that at Banff, Canada 1933. He was a participant in the Congress of Europe at the Hague, Netherlands in 1948.\n\nHe travelled to the British Dominions and helped the independent establishment of the various Commonwealth Institutes of International Affairs or where such bodies had earlier been established in both Australia and Canada to generate financial support from benefactors in order that they could have their own full-time secretariats. The Canadian Institute of International Affairs funding 1932; the Australian funding 1934. The formation of the Institutes in New Zealand 1934; in South Africa 1934; in Indian 1936; in Pakistan 1947.\n\nAt Chatham House he is remembered for his Scottish drive and application ... He organised persons, events and work with equal stern objectivity.<br> The Times, 24 December 1974\n\nHe was the institute’s chief executive for a period of 25 years during which it grew from a promising pioneering experiment into a well established and internationally respected centre for the study and discussion of world affairs.\nWhen asked who founded Chatham House, Ivison would reply with a list of distinguished people, among whom Lionel Curtis took pride of place, and would emphasise the great amount of time that they devoted in shaping the institute’s policy in the early days. This no doubt was true, but it was Ivison who had to carry their ideas into practice, raise the money and recruit the staff.\n\nHe was a gifted promoter of Chatham House and its objectives, obtaining endowments in Britain and the Commonwealth and also gaining the support of the great American foundations, Carnegie, Rockefeller and later Ford. In this important American connection he was greatly helped by his American wife, Caroline, whose numerous friends in her own country opened many doors.<br> The Times, 31 December 1974\n\nHe was Assistant Director General and Assistant Secretary to the Ministry of Information during World War II between 1939 – 41.\n\nAfter his unpublicised pre-war and then public wartime role in establishing the Ministry, he returned to the Royal Institute in March 1941 to continue its war work and oversee the post-war international reconstruction planning there.\n\nHe was the Editor and the Chairman of the Advisory Board of The Annual Register of World Events for the years 1947–72, the world’s oldest annual reference book founded by Edmund Burke. He put the Annual Register on a sound financial footing and strengthened its worldwide reputation by bringing in a wide range of specialist contributors. Sales expanded considerably, particularly in the United States. <br> The Times, 24 December 1974\n\nHe was a member (1930–1974) of the editorial body (the Moot) of : \"A quarterly Review of the Politics of the British Commonwealth\" as it was known at the time (now The Round Table:The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs). Britain’s oldest international journal. He was the Round Table's Honorary Secretary in the postwar years.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of King's College London in 1939, and served as a member of the King's College Council 1957–74; its Delegacy 1960–74; a member of its Finance Committee, and on many special sub-committees both to the Delegacy and Council and Vice-Chairman 1971–74. On his election Macadam preposed that two students nominated by their peers sit on the governing body. This was adopted and King's was one of the first universities to follow this practise.\nOn his retirement as Vice-Chairman in 1974 the Delegacy minutes of 15 January 1974 recorded his service to King's: In 1919, at the age of 25, Ivison Macadam entered the Faculty of Engineering at King’s College as a student. With a distinguished war service from 1914–19, including command of the Royal Engineers in the Archangel Expeditionary Force, he brought to College the experience and maturity which characterised many young ex-servicemen of both world wars. At King’s these qualities were quickly recognised by his election as President of the Union Society, and in a wider context of student life when he became the Founder President, and later Trustee of the National Union of Students.\n\nAfter taking his degree he remained an unfailing supporter of all College activities during the difficult years of the thirties, and in 1939 was elected a Fellow. Knighted in 1955 Sir Ivison was appointed a member of the Council in 1957 and three years later he became a member of the Delegacy. Since then he has served as its Vice-Chairman, as a member of its Finance Committee, and on many special sub-committees both of the Delegacy and Council.\n\nA close association of fifty-five years with one’s own College is a rare achievement. When that half century has been notable for constant devotion to its interests, based on both understanding and affection, the achievement is doubly rare.\n\nIn return Sir Ivison has evoked the affection he has given. At all meetings of both governing bodies and as chairman of sub-committees his advice has been sought and valued. His firm kindly manner, his robust presence and his Scottish clarity combined to make him one of the most permanent and respected figures in College life.\n\nHis resignation from the Delegacy is received both with a sense of severe loss and a sense of deep gratitude.\n\nHe was a founding member of the Council, King George’s Jubilee Trust (for youth) on which he served from 1935–74, first under the Chairmanship of the Prince of Wales, until he ascended to the throne as Edward VIII; then under the chairmanship of Duke of York, until he ascended to the throne on the abdication of his brother as George VI and then under the chairmanship of the King's brother, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, under whom he served as Vice-Chairman (1972–74), when the Duke was suffering from ill health, until Prince Charles had finished his naval service and was able to take over as Chairman. It is now run under the umbrella of The Prince's Trust under the Chairmanship of the Prince of Wales.\n\nMacadam was responsible for devising the concept of, creating, editing and organising the printing and distribution of the official royal programs to be published under the auspices of the King George’s Jubilee Trust.\n\nThe programs published the details of the processions and order of service for King George V and Queen Mary’s Jubilee, 1935; The Coronation of their Majesties King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, 1937; The wedding of the Princess Elizabeth and Lt. Philip Mountbatten, RN, 1947; The Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, 1953; the wedding of the Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong-Jones,1960 and the wedding of the Princess Alexandra of Kent and Angus Ogilvy, 1963.\n\nThey were sold on behalf of King George’s Jubilee Trust mainly along the parade routes on the day of the event by the Boy Scouts but also prior to it in newsagents and bookshops. The substantial additional funds thus raised helped support the work of King George's Jubilee Trust in aiding young people, youth organisations and youth projects.\n\nOther voluntary roles included:\n\nWhen Macadam was only seven, his father was shot and killed by a mentally disturbed gunman in an Edinburgh tragedy In 1902.\n\nIn 1938 he married, Caroline Ladd Corbett, who was born and raised in Portland, Oregon USA (Born 20 September 1910 at Portland, Multnomah Co. Died on 28 August 1989 in East Runton, Norfolk). Her parents were Elliott Ruggles Corbett (1884–1963) and Alta Rittenhouse Smith (1886–1976). Caroline was the great-granddaughter of two of Portland's pioneers (Henry W. Corbett and William S. Ladd). Before her marriage, she was Assistant to the US Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, and the couple met at the IPR's international conference that Macadam had arranged at Banff, Canada in 1933.\n\nAfter their marriage, she was of invaluable support to her husband in his professional life and in assisting him to raise the substantial funding required for the operations of the RIIA. She was later Chairman of the Eastern Counties Women’s Conservative Associations.\n\nThe couple had four children: Helen Ivison Macadam (who married 1. Ian Wightwick M.C., 2. The Rev. Roger Taylor), William Ivison Macadam, Elliott Corbett Macadam and Caroline Alta Macadam (who is married to Francesco Colacicchi and writes under the name of Alta Macadam). The couple lived in London and at Runton Old Hall, East Runton, Norfolk. Macadam was a keen sportsman, shot and fly fisherman.\n\n\nHe died on 22 December 1974, at his London home at 16 Upper Belgrave Street, London.\n\nHe is buried with his wife next to his father in Portobello Cemetery in Edinburgh. \n\nThe inscription reads: SIR IVISON STEVENSON MACADAM, Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, Knight Bachelor, CBE, OBE (military), FRSE, MImechE.

Before the advent of the current cruiserweight class, \"light heavyweight\" and \"cruiserweight\" were sometimes used interchangeably in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe current weight limit for the division is 200 pounds (14 stone 4 pounds / 90.7 kg). When originally established, the weight limit was 190 pounds (13st. 8 lbs. / 86.2 kg). The division was established in order to accommodate smaller heavyweight boxers who could not compete with the growing size of boxers in that division. While many great heavyweight champions (such as Rocky Marciano and Joe Louis) weighed around 190 pounds in their career, during the 1970s it became fairly standard that fit heavyweight boxers weighed at least 210 pounds. It was felt by many boxing authorities that asking men weighing between 176 and 190 pounds to fight these larger men was unfair.\n\nThe WBC was the first boxing organization to recognize the cruiserweight division when it sanctioned a bout between Marvin Camel and Mate Parlov on December 8, 1979, for their version of the title. That fight was a draw, but in the rematch in March 1980 Camel won and became the first cruiserweight champion. In 1982 the World Boxing Association recognized Ossie Ocasio as their first cruiserweight champion when he defeated South African Robbie Williams (although at that time the WBA called the division \"junior heavyweight\"). The International Boxing Federation followed suit in 1983 when it matched former WBC champion Marvin Camel against Rick Sekorski for their inaugural title. Camel won and became the first IBF cruiserweight champion.\n\nSeveral boxers moved up to heavyweight after winning world titles at cruiserweight. Evander Holyfield unified the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles to become undisputed champion, the first to do so, and then moved up to the heavyweight division in 1988. The second man to become undisputed champion was O’Neil Bell in 2006 who was later stripped of the IBF title.\n\nOther notable champions in the division have been Bobby Czyz, Dwight Muhammad Qawi, Tomasz Adamek, Virgil Hill, Al Cole, Orlin Norris, James Toney, David Haye and Oleksandr Usyk.\n\nAs of 17, 2020.\n\nKeys:\n\nBelow is a list of longest reigning cruiserweight champions in boxing measured by the individual's longest reign. Career total time as champion (for multiple time champions) does not apply.\n\nIn kickboxing, a cruiserweight fighter generally weighs between 82 kg (181 lb) and 88 kg (195 lb). However, some governing bodies have slightly different classes. For example, the International Kickboxing Federation (IKF) Cruiserweight (professional and amateur) division is 186.1 lbs.–195 lbs. or 84.6 kg–88.6 kg.\n"}

He played in Japan and represented the Japanese international side. He is a former New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international utility player, Wing played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Sydney Roosters.\n\nWing was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. He is of Filipino descent through his mother.\n\nHe attended Sydney Boys High School where he played Rugby Union. In 1997 Wing was selected to play in the NSW Schoolboys 1st XV where the team remained undefeated until the final decider.\n\nWing made his first grade debut for South Sydney against the Auckland Warriors in round 1 1998 at Mt Smart Stadium. In round 10 of the 1999 NRL season, Wing announced himself as a talent of the future when he scored a solo try against Cronulla-Sutherland where he beat five Cronulla players to cross over the line. Wing scored two tries for South Sydney in what was to be their final ever game when they played against Parramatta in round 26 1999 at Parramatta Stadium. Following the conclusion of the 1999 NRL season, Souths were controversially excluded from the competition as part of the NRL's rationalisation policy. After Souths were excluded, he joined the club's arch rivals the Sydney Roosters.\n\nWing played most of his professional rugby league at the Sydney Roosters. He moved to the club in 2000 and originally started as a halfback partnering Brad Fittler. Wing played from the interchange bench in the Sydney Roosters' 2000 NRL Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Broncos. He played at halfback in the Roosters team which won the 2002 NRL Grand Final against the New Zealand Warriors, scoring a try.\n\nHaving won the 2002 NRL Premiership, the Roosters travelled to England to play the 2003 World Club Challenge against Super League champions, St Helens R.F.C.. Wing played at half back in the Roosters victory. Wing was later moved to in 2003 when halfback Brett Finch joined the club. After his side's loss in the 2003 NRL grand final, Wing was selected to go on the 2003 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, helping Australia to victory over Great Britain in what would be the last time the two nations contested an Ashes series.\n\nWing played for the Roosters at in their 2004 NRL grand final loss to cross-Sydney rivals, the Bulldogs. Wing was selected in the Australian team to go and compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Great Britain he played from the interchange bench in the Kangaroos' 44–4 victory.\n\nWing played in four NRL Grand Finals, a feat achieved by very few players in the NRL, and all with the Roosters: 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004.\n\nWing announced in June 2007 that he would be leaving the Roosters at the end of the 2007 NRL season to take up a four-year contract with the South Sydney Rabbitohs, the club where he started his career.\n\nWhile the Roosters' offer was higher, Wing said he felt more comfortable accepting the Souths offer as it was a guaranteed four-year deal compared to the Roosters' 2-year deal with an option for a further 2 years.\n\nWing came under criticism for allowing himself to be paraded at a high-profile Souths press conference while still contracted at the Sydney Roosters. It could be argued that the Roosters started the whole problem in the first place however, as they broke the news of Craig Wing's signing on their website before Souths had officially signed him, in an apparent attempt to steal Souths thunder. In any case, Wing still apologised to the Roosters fans. He was jeered on 23 June 2007, by the Roosters fans at a game against the Parramatta Eels, his first game after signing for Souths.\n\nIn round 1 of the season, Wing was injured in a tackle in only the 8th minute of the game against his old club the Roosters. Wing was in the process of being tackled by Anthony Tupou and Braith Anasta, when Riley Brown shoulder charged Wing's back. Wing was sidelined for 12 weeks. In a much awaited return, Wing helped Souths to only their fourth win of the season in his return from injury, beating bottom placed North Queensland Cowboys 29–28 in the greatest comeback in Souths' history, having been down 28–4 at one stage of the game.\n\nWing represented the New South Wales State of Origin team, City Origin and the Australian Kangaroos.\n\nHe was named in the Australia training squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. He was selected for City in the City vs Country match on 8 May 2009.\n\nIn May 2009, he was named in the 17-man squad to represent New South Wales in the opening game of the 2009 State of Origin series on 3 June 2009, in Melbourne.\n\nWing announced on 21 July 2009 that he would be leaving South Sydney to play rugby union in Japan for the NTT Communications Shining Arcs and in 2010, he joined his former NSW Schoolboys 1st XV coach Joe Barakat who was coaching with the team.\n\nIn 2012, after two seasons with Shining Arcs, he moved to the Kobelco Steelers, where he is listed as playing centre or stand-off.\n\nHis switch to rugby union attracted interest from the Philippines national rugby union team who approached him to play for them, as he qualified through his mother who is Filipina. Despite this interest, in 2013 he was instead selected for the Japan Cherry Blossoms, having qualified after 3 years residency. He made his debut for Japan in May 2013 in a match against the UAE. He scored his first try for Japan in June 2013, in a historic 23–8 win over , playing at centre in a side coached by fellow Australian Eddie Jones.\n\n"}

It was designed starting in 1963, and in operation from 1964 to 1973. \n\nIn 1961, the University of Cambridge found itself unable to fund a suitably powerful computer for its needs at the time, so the University purchased from Ferranti the main Atlas processing units and then jointly designed the memory and peripheral equipment. The joint effort led to a cheaper and simpler version of the Atlas that Ferranti could market, leaving Cambridge with the prototype version, named Titan.\n\nThe Atlas hardware arrived in Cambridge in 1963, although software design was already underway. David Wheeler was in charge of the joint effort between the University and Ferranti.\n\nIn 1965 the Cambridge side of the team decided to add a time-sharing facility for Titan, necessitating the acquisition of additional hardware. When Titan came into full service in 1966, time sharing was available for all staff. Titan was finally switched off in October 1973.\n\nFerranti, by then a division of International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), marketed the Titan as the Atlas 2.\nAlthough intended to be more affordable than the Atlas, its price was still over £1 million.\nA second Atlas 2 was built in Manchester, and was installed at the Computer-Aided Design Centre (CADCentre) on Madingley Road together with the Cambridge Titan supervisor. This machine, the last Atlas, was finally switched off on 21 December 1976.\n\nA third Atlas 2 was ordered by the UK's Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) at Aldermaston. It replaced the faster and much more expensive IBM 7030 Stretch which had been leased from IBM.\n\nTitan differed from the original Manchester Atlas by having a real, but cached, main memory, rather than the paged (or virtual) memory used in the Manchester machine. It initially had 28K of memory, but this was expanded first to 64K and later to 128K. The Titan's main memory had 128K of 48-bit words and was implemented using ferrite core store rather than the part core, part rotating drum-store used on the Manchester Atlas. Titan also had two large hard-disk drives and several magnetic tape decks.\n\nAs with the Manchester Atlas, it used discrete components, in particular germanium transistors. Some of these components can be seen in the online relics collection of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.\n\nTitan was the computer on which a team from Ferranti based in Bracknell working with David Barron, David Hartley, Roger Needham and Barry Landy of Cambridge University Maths Lab developed the early multi-user time-sharing operating system called Titan Supervisor. This was arguably the world's first commercially sold time-sharing operating system. Other experiments in time-sharing, such as CTSS and PLATO in the US, were one-of-a-kind research projects.\n\nOne of Titan's most intensive uses was to compute the inverse Fourier Transforms of data from the One-Mile Radio Telescope.\n"}

He was a Reuters correspondent in Washington in the 1930s and a war correspondent during World War II in North Africa, Burma and Moscow.\n\nAlaric Jacob was the son of Ellen Hoyer, the daughter of a Danish missionary, and Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Fenton Jacob, a member of the Indian Army and former political agent in Aden. Jacob was born in Edinburgh and brought up in Scotland. As a child, he spent time in India and Arabia, but was educated in England. He was childhood friends with Soviet spy Kim Philby. Jacob developed a stammer, which he believed came from his association with Philby and was cured over time by singing lessons.\n\nLike several other promising children from Anglo-Indian or military families, Jacob attended St Cyprian's School for reduced fees. English novelist George Orwell left the school the year before Jacob started, and was presented as an inspiration to the students. Jacob's first term at St Cyprian's overlapped with English writer and literary critic Cyril Connolly's last year there. Connolly gave a lesson in Jacob's last year. For Jacob it was \"...an age of friendships, of excitement on the cricket fields and in school plays, of singing to a receptive audience at concerts, of having a sonnet printed in the school magazine, of winning the Townsend Warner History Prize.\" Jacob struggled with the classics and did not enter for a scholarship to public school. He instead studied at The King's School, Canterbury; however, unimpressed with what he was learning, he left school and moved to France to pursue a career in journalism.\n\nWhile in France, Jacob began writing, returning to England after the General Strike. When he was seventeen, his first play was produced in Plymouth, where he started his career as a journalist on the Western Morning News. His second play, \"The Compleat Cynic\", was produced in Plymouth the following year. In 1930, at age 21, he published his first novel \"Seventeen\", a fictionalized account of his school days in Canterbury. By then he had become a close friend of Margot Asquith, forty years his senior, who became his mentor and literary influence. She introduced him to editors and important literary figures, including Sir Roderick Jones, the head of Reuters, and was offered a position as diplomatic correspondent for Reuters in London.\n\nDuring his time in London, Jacob moved in high social and intellectual circles. He wrote a play in which the hero was a communist and as a result, decided to read \"Das Kapital\". In 1934, he married Iris Morley, daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Chartres Morley. She was a historical novelist and journalist for \"The Observer\" and the \"Yorkshire Post\". Early in their marriage, they bonded amidst the Great Depression and hunger marches. This period stirred up socialist sentiments in the couple. In 1936 the Jacobs went to Washington where he was in regular and close contact with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They stayed in Washington until the outbreak of World War II, when they returned to London.\n\nJacob remained in London until May 1941 when became a war correspondent for the \"Daily Express\". He sailed to Cairo, taking the long sea route via Cape Town. He spent the next two years with the 8th Army in North Africa, initially covering the Siege of Tobruk and Operation Crusader. He was withdrawn from Tobruk shortly before it fell to the Germans and was posted to Tehran where he received permission from the Soviet Embassy to visit the Red Army in Azerbaijan. He returned to Egypt for the first and second Battle of El Alamein, before traveling to India. He covered Wingate's first 'Chindit' expedition in Burma, and the circumstances of Gandhi's fast. In the Soviet Union for four months, he covered the Battle of Kursk and Stalin's counterattack. He described his experiences in \"A Traveler's War\" published in 1944.\n\nAfter Christmas leave in England in 1943, Jacob and Iris sailed to the Soviet Union in January 1944 on board a ship of the Arctic Convoy. They spent the remainder of the war in Moscow, covering the advances of the Red Army in Odessa, the Crimea, and through Vitebsk, Minsk, Poland, and on to the fall of Berlin. He published \"A Window in Moscow\" in 1945. His experiences made him sympathetic towards the Soviet regime and he stayed in the Soviet Union, on and off, until the start of the cold war in late 1947. Iris had become a Communist and her ideas strongly influenced him. He suspected that her membership of the Communist Party worked against him even when they were separated. \nIn 1949, Jacob published \"Scenes from a Bourgeois Life\", a semi-autobiographical novel and an apologia for the paradoxes and anomalies of his career. As an English traditionalist, he disapproved of \"ribbon development\" and the displacement of the old order by the \"nouveaux riches\". His writing showed contempt for the pursuit of wealth through industrial capitalism and his appreciation for the Soviet Union's achievements. His work detailed his amorous adventures and his marked contempt for Cyril Connolly, who wallowed in self-pity in \"The Unquiet Grave\", and for other \"stay-at-home intellectuals with comfortable jobs in the BBC\", while Soviet heroes fought the Battle of Stalingrad.\n\nIn August 1948, Jacob joined the BBC monitoring service in Caversham, Reading, but on February 1951 he was \"suddenly refused establishment rights, which meant he would receive no pension\". He complained unsuccessfully to his cousin Sir Ian Jacob, who was prominent in the BBC and later became the organization's Director-General. Some have attributed Jacob's problems to the fact that his name was on Orwell's list, a list of people with pro-communist leanings, prepared in March 1949 by Orwell for his friend Celia Kirwan at the Information Research Department, a propaganda unit set up at the Foreign Office by the Labor government. Jacob's establishment and pension rights were restored shortly after Iris (also on Orwell's list) died in 1953. By the time he retired in 1972, Jacob had become a senior editor at Bush House, then the base of the BBC World Service.\n\nAfter Iris died in 1953, Jacob married British actress Kathleen Byron. He had one daughter with Iris, and a son and daughter with Kathleen.\n\nJournalist Paul Hogarth described Jacob in his obituary as the quintessential English journalist; urbane yet modest, with a bone-dry sense of humor and a razor intelligence. \"He possessed the grand manner of an Edwardian foreign correspondent with an Alan-Clark-like taste for vintage claret, a good cigar and fine brandy\".\n\nJacob died in Lambeth, London, aged 85 on 26 January 1995. Byron survived him, dying in January 2009.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1839316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839316", "title": "Chthonic (band)", "text": "Chthonic (band)\n\nChthonic (sometimes typeset ChthoniC or ChThoniC) is a Taiwanese heavy metal band, formed in 1995 in Taipei. They have been called \"the Black Sabbath of Asia.\" The group incorporates influences from traditional Taiwanese music, including adaptations of folk songs and the use of traditional instruments, most notably the erhu (often called the \"hiân-á\" [] in the band's native Taiwanese Hokkien). Their stated goal is to use their music to bring ancient history and mythology into the modern era via a pan-green focus, especially to build awareness of the myths of Taiwan and tragic events in that country's history (for example, those experienced by the Seediq people).\n\nSince 2011 their trademark erhu has been complemented with stringed instruments including the koto and shamisen, as well as Tibetan Bells and shakuhachi and pgaki flutes, the latter of which are traditionally used by the aboriginal people of Taiwan. The band members are also acclaimed artists and political activists who advocate independence for Taiwan and self-determination for Tibetans and Uighurs. Singer Freddy Lim served as Chairman of the Taiwan chapter of Amnesty International from 2010 to 2014 and has been a legislator since 2016, first representing the New Power Party before becoming an independent. Since their formation, Chthonic has released eight studio albums. Their most recent full-length record, \"Battlefields of Asura\", was released in October 2018.\n\nChthonic was formed in 1995, and the band name \"Chthonic\" is a Greek term referring to the earth and the underworld. In the west, the term is usually pronounced \"thonic\". The original members were Freddy Lim and some of his classmates from high school and university. The line-up went through many changes before the band released their debut album in 1998. By that point the line-up had settled around Freddy Lim on vocals and erhu, Zac Chang on guitar, Xiao-Yu on bass, Xiao-Wang on drums, and Ambrosia on keyboards and backing vocals. Chthonic became quite popular in the rock scene in Taiwan. They played to a full house at Vibe, the main rock club in Taipei at the time, and played as headliners for large rock festivals like Spring Scream. They released their first single \"深耕\" (\"Deep Plowing\") in early 1998.\n\nIn their early years, Chthonic tried different styles of heavy metal. Lim sang clean vocals in \"海息\" (\"The Breath of Ocean\"); the early song \"深耕\" (\"Cultivating\") can be classified as power metal while \"母島解體登基\" (\"Decomposition of the Mother Isle (Aboriginal Gods Enthroned)\") is black metal. Keyboardist Ambrosia occasionally sang in the early songs as well. From the start, Lim has written songs in Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and Mandarin Chinese; more recent albums have been released in English versions as well.\n\nChthonic's debut album, \"Where the Ancestors' Souls Gathered (祖靈之流)\", was released in late 1998. The band released the album independently and it reached No. 2 on the Tower Records pop music chart for Asia. In 1999 Zac, Xiao-Yu, and Xiao-Wang left the band and were replaced by Jesse Liu, Doris Yeh, and AJ Tsai respectively. The band recorded their second album \"9th Empyrean (靈魄之界)\", which was released in Taiwan by Crystal Records in 2000. It reached No. 1 on the Tower Records pop music chart for Asia and was also considered one of the best ten Mandarin albums of that year by Hong Kong's \"MCB\" magazine. This album's music style is closer to symphonic black metal, with Lim adopting harsh vocals mixed with keyboardist Ambrosia's female singing. The song \"永固邦稷\" (\"Guard the Isle Eternally\") was the first Chthonic song to mix Asian pentatonic scale melodies with black metal.\n\nIn 2000, Chthonic appeared at the Fuji Rock Festival, one of the biggest rock festivals in Japan, and embarked on their first international tour through Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. \nIn Hong Kong, they signed with Catalyst Action Records, and in Japan, Soundholic was their distributor.\n\nIn 2001, keyboardist Ambrosia left the band and was replaced by Vivien Chen. Chthonic then recorded their third album, \"Relentless Recurrence\", which was based on the legendary Taiwanese ghost story \"Lin-tou Jie.\" The album was recorded in Denmark and released in Taiwan by Crystal Records in 2002. The album retains the symphonic black metal style mixed with Taiwanese elements. \"Relentless Recurrence\" was also the first Chthonic album written entirely in Taiwanese. In 2002 the band completed their second international tour, and played at the old stadium of National Taiwan University with traditional Taiwanese lion drums and a traditional Taiwanese orchestra.\n\nIn 2002 Chthonic signed with Nightfall Records in the United States and released an English version of \"9th Empyrean\" in North America. All subsequent Chthonic albums have been released internationally in English versions. In 2002 the band played festivals in the United States, Japan, and Hong Kong; and toured with Swedish black metal band Dark Funeral. In late 2002 keyboardist Vivien Chen left the band and was replaced by Luis Wei. In 2003 the band released the single \"Satan's Horns,\" which was used as the theme song for the Taiwanese release of the movie \"Freddy vs. Jason\". In 2003 they won the Best Band Award at the Taiwan Golden Melodies Award Ceremony.\n\nIn 2004 Alexia Lee replaced Luis Wei on keyboards and Dani Wang replaced AJ Tsai on drums. In 2005 the band released their fourth album, \"Seediq Bale\", which is based on the Wushe Incident. In addition to symphonic black metal mixed with Taiwanese elements, \"Seediq Bale\" featured increased use of erhu, blast beats, and female vocals (including a guest appearance by pop singer Sandee Chan). The album was released in Mandarin Chinese and English versions, with both integrating some Seediq and Japanese lyrics. This album also supported donations for the movie project \"Seediq Bale\" directed by Wei Te-sheng, who in turn donated the film's trailer for Chthonic's use in the music video for \"Quasi Putrefaction.\"\n\nAfter the release of \"Seediq Bale\" keyboardist Alexia Lee left and was replaced by CJ Kao; the erhu player Su-nong also joined the band. In early 2006, Chthonic held the \"A Decade on the Throne\" concert in Huashan Culture Park, Taipei. To celebrate their tenth anniversary the band released a DVD of that concert, the compilation album \"Pandemonium\", and the book \"CHTHONIC Dynasty\" (閃靈王朝) via Eurasian Books. \"Seediq Bale\" (English version) was released in 2006 and 2007 in many countries; in Japan it was released by Howling Bull, in North America by Megaforce Records, and in Europe by SPV Records; the album was also released in several South American and Asian countries. \"Revolver\" cited Chthonic as \"The Band to Watch\" and England's \"Alternative Vision\" awarded them \"Band of the Month.\"\n\nIn 2007 Chthonic were featured as a second stage act at the 2007 Ozzfest tour. The band named that year's tour \"UNlimited Taiwan Tour\" to draw awareness to the fact that the United Nations does not recognize Taiwan. This symbolic protest was covered by the US mainstream media, including ABC television, \"New York Times\", \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Washington Post\", and others. That year they also toured with Nile, Dååth, Obituary, Cradle of Filth, Marduk, Ensiferum, and 3 Inches of Blood while playing in several European countries. A book titled \"GUTS!\", featuring a diary of the UNlimited Taiwan Tour, was released in Europe and Asia.\n\nChthonic released the album \"Mirror of Retribution\" in 2009 on Spinefarm Records, produced by Anthrax guitarist Rob Caggiano. \"Mirror of Retribution\" is based on the February 28 Incident and features guest appearances by singers Sandee Chan and Francine Boucher of the band Echoes of Eternity. The album was released in Taiwanese and English versions. The British music magazine \"Kerrang!\" called the album \"Top-notch\" metal, and Freddy Lim appeared on the cover of \"Terrorizer\" magazine.\nDuring this period, bassist Doris Yeh became the band's spokesperson and business manager, taking over the roles performed by Freddy Lim since the band's formation in 1995. Yeh has since earned a great amount of publicity, speaking about the band's political beliefs in magazines like \"Monocle\" in the United Kingdom, \"Metropolis\" in Japan, and \"Cacao\" in Taiwan. Yeh has also been recognized as a model and sex symbol, appearing on the cover of the Taiwanese version of \"Body\" magazine and regularly being selected as one of the sexiest women in music by \"Revolver\" and the Taiwanese version of \"FHM\".\n\nChthonic was named \"Best International Artist\" in 2009 at the Tibetan Music Awards. Erhu player Su-nong left the band in 2009, with Lim taking over that instrument. In the 2009 \"Terrorizer\" readers' polls the band was voted No. 2 for best band, No. 2 for best album, and No. 2 for best performance; Freddy Lim was voted No. 3 for best singer, Doris Yeh was voted No. 2 for best bass player; Jesse Liu was voted No. 7 for best guitarist, and Dani Wang was voted No. 8 for best drummer. Yeh and Lim were also No. 9 and No. 10 respectively as best individual performer, making Chthonic the only band to have two members in the top 10 for that category. In 2009 and 2010 Chthonic continued to tour internationally, including stints with Satyricon, Bleeding Through, and Arch Enemy, plus appearances at several major heavy metal festivals in Asia and Europe. In 2010 the band released the digital single \"Painkiller,\" a Judas Priest cover.\n\nTheir sixth album \"Takasago Army\" was released on Spinefarm Records in 2011. This album is based on the story of the Takasago Volunteers, Taiwanese aboriginal soldiers who fought for Japan during World War II. The album included guest appearances from singers Yu Tien and Chan Yawen, and Taroko musician Pitero Wukah on pgaku flute. Main songwriters Freddy Lim and Jesse Liu stated that \"Takasago Army\" marked a reversal in the band's writing, as the songs were first written in a traditional Taiwanese folk format but were then played with heavy metal techniques. Doris Yeh stated that the Western definition of \"heavy metal,\" whether it is black metal or death metal, cannot easily define Chthonic's style; thus, having to choose a term, the band uses the term \"Orient Metal.\"\n\n\"Takasago Army\" reached No. 109 on Japan's Oricon music chart, and the video for the song \"Takao\" was nominated for the 2012 Golden Melody Award in Taiwan for best music video. The album was featured in the international metal magazines \"Revolver\", \"Terrorizer\", and \"Metal Hammer\", and was named the year's best melodic black metal album by the critics' webzine \"Metal Storm\". Furthermore, \"Boulevard Brutal\", a French music critics' site, selected \"Takasago Army\" as the best black metal album of the year; and the Japanese rock magazine \"Burrn!!\" awarded the band a No. 7 rank for best album of the year and No. 23 for best heavy metal band.\n\nAfter more international touring in North America, Europe, and Asia, including stints with Arch Enemy, Devil Driver, and Skeletonwitch, in October 2011 Chthonic organized a concert at Taiwan's remote Sing Ling Temple, a historical landmark mentioned in their last three albums. This concert featured a guest appearance by singer Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, while selected fans from outside of Taiwan were given free plane tickets to travel to the concert. The competition for tickets was covered widely in Taiwanese media. In early 2012 Chthonic released a DVD of the Sing Ling Temple concert and also made some acoustic appearances at Eslite bookstores in Taiwan. In 2012 Chthonic supported Lamb of God in Asia, while ESP Guitars released customized models for bassist Doris Yeh and guitarist Jesse Liu. Chthonic continued to play major festivals in Europe and Asia, with former Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman appearing with the band at Japan's Fuji Rock Festival.\n\nThe band's seventh studio album, \"Bu-Tik\", and was released in June 2013 worldwide through Spinefarm Records. The album cover for \"Bu-Tik\" depicts a nude female with white hair wielding a sword in her right hand and a prosthetic gun on her left arm.\n\n\"Timeless Sentence (失竊千年 )\", a live album featuring acoustic rearrangements of songs from the two previous studio albums, was released in late 2014 by Spinefarm Records. In an interview, the band indicated that this will be their last acoustic album. Freddy Lim then expanded his political activities, founding the New Power Party in early 2015. In January 2016, Lim was elected to Taiwan's Legislative Yuan representing Taipei City Constituency 5. He was then assigned to the Foreign and National Defense Committee and has formed a caucus to address issues in Tibet.\n\nIn June 2016, Lim stated in an interview that Chthonic planned to release an EP in 2017, though the record has not yet appeared as of early 2018. There have not yet been plans to release a full-length follow-up to 2013's \"Bu-Tik\". In March 2017, Chthonic played at the Megaport Music Festival; bassist Doris Yeh was absent due to recently giving birth and Shingo☆ of Sex Machineguns filled in.\n\nA new song titled \"Souls of the Revolution,\" featuring Randy Blythe, was released in December 2017. The song is featured in the band-produced film \"Tshiong\", which was released in Taiwan on 29 December 2017. The film, in development since 2015 and also featuring Blythe, is an action-comedy starring the members of Chthonic as political activists trying to stop a development project in a small Taiwanese village. A soundtrack album featuring \"Souls of the Revolution\" and incidental score music was released in Asia. At the 2018 Megaport Music Festival, Chthonic performed another new song called \"A Crimson Sky's Command\". Chthonic's eighth and most recent album \"Battlefields of Asura\" was announced on August 8, 2018, and it was released on October 10.\n\nIn December 2018, Chthonic was unable to perform with Cantopop singer Denise Ho in Hong Kong since their work visa application was rejected due to domestic security reasons. The band ultimately ended up performing the song \"Millennia's Faith Undone\" remotely via Facebook.\n\nChthonic singer Freddy Lim is notably active in the Taiwanese political scene and supports that country's independence movement. He has been active in the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, Amnesty International (serving as President of that group's Taiwan chapter from 2010 to 2014), and other non-governmental human rights organizations. In 2003 and 2009, he promoted the Free Tibet Concert in Taiwan. In 2007 Lim and other artists organized an international music festival to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the February 28 Incident, entitled \"Spirit of Taiwan: With Justice We Cure This Nation.\" He is now a representative in the Legislative Yuan.\n\nIn addition, bassist Doris Yeh has endorsed the Awakening Foundation, a women's rights organization in Taiwan. In February 2009, Lim and Yeh protested with human rights activists at the Taipei zoo panda exhibit, which symbolizes China's attempts to establish soft power relations with Taiwan. In August 2009, many aboriginal villages in Taiwan were heavily damaged by Typhoon Morakot, and Chthonic donated the proceeds from two concerts to an aboriginal organization. Lim personally carried supplies into the disaster areas. In March 2011, after the northeastern Japan earthquake, Chthonic raised and donated over one million NT$ for relief efforts.\n\nDuring Chthonic's 2011 North American tour, they received a threatening letter from unknown Chinese persons. The band is also banned in parts of China for their political views.\n\nThe band's lyrics are often based on the defiant spirit of early Taiwanese colonizers, fictional wars between aboriginal gods and Han Chinese gods, Taiwanese folklore and mythology, historical events such as the Wushe Incident and the February 28 Incident, and the formation of the Takasago Volunteers. Prior to the album \"Seediq Bale\" most of the band's lyrics were written in Classical Chinese, which is rarely used in contemporary Chinese or Taiwanese music, and sung with Mandarin pronunciation. Starting with the album \"Mirror of Retribution\" the lyrics are written and sung in Taiwanese Hokkien. Some songs may also include verses in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, or Formosan languages. Starting with \"Seediq Bale\" the band has released alternate versions of their albums for the international market, with some songs remixed with English lyrics.\n\nChthonic is also known for their unique stage costumes, which originally included corpse paint similar to that used by many Scandinavian black metal bands, from which Chthonic drew their early inspiration. Starting in 1998 Chthonic incorporated some Taiwanese elements and characteristics into their stage attire, such as the \"8 Generals of Hell\" glyphs on Freddy Lim's forehead. Keyboardist CJ Kao uses a cloth inscribed with Chinese characters wrapped around his head, which in mythology is a spell to raise Chinese Vampires from the dead.\n\nWith the release of the album \"Takasago Army\" in 2011, Chthonic changed to costumes inspired by Asian military or martial arts attire. They stopped using corpse paint because the band members found it tedious to put on before concerts. Fans often toss hell money during Chthonic's stage performances to pay tribute to the lost souls described in the songs and to create a dark atmosphere. People of Chinese culture who are unfamiliar with Chthonic may find this offensive or disrespectful because the practice is considered to be taboo. \nThe band is also known for burning the flag of the Kuomintang Party, of whom the band are well-known critics, first doing so in the video for the song \"Forty-Nine Theurgy Chains\" in 2009. This aroused some controversy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It consists of wetlands, fields, and forests. The refuge surrounds the former farm of Charles Hinckley and later Charles Albert Creamer (1889-1974), a former chicken rancher from Washington state who moved to Fairbanks. Creamer saved waste grains from his barn to feed migrating birds. After Creamer's death, preservationists banded together to make the area a state refuge. The Creamer farmstead now serves as a visitor center and environmental education center, with the non-profit \"Friends of Creamer's Field\" presenting programs year-round. In the summer visitors can take a guided nature walk on the refuge trails. The refuge is open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. It is a multi-use refuge, and limited hunting is also allowed in certain seasons. In winter dog mushing trails criss cross the back of the acreage, while skijorers have trails in the front fields.\n\nAmong the birds that flock to the refuge in late summer during migration south are Sandhill Cranes, Many ducks and Canada geese.\n\nCharles Hinckley built a log barn and opened a dairy business upon arriving in Fairbanks in 1904. In 1938 Charles Albert Creamer succeeded to Hinckley and built the modern day barn, which is still visible today. All other buildings in the area were constructed subsequently after, up to the closure of business in 1965. The State of Alaska purchased all the land around the dairy in 1969, to establish the Migratory Refuge. The property is the only group of pioneer dairy farm buildings surviving in the interior of Alaska.\n\nThe Creamer's Dairy, also known as Hinckley's Dairy, comprising the barn and five other historical buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.\n\n\n"}

It gave Women in the Russian Revolution new opportunities until Stalin closed it in 1930.\n\nThe Zhenotdel was established by two Russian feminist revolutionaries, Alexandra Kollontai and Inessa Armand, in 1919. It was devoted to improving the conditions of women's lives throughout the Soviet Union, fighting illiteracy, and educating women about the new marriage, education, and working laws put in place by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In Soviet Central Asia, the Zhenotdel also spearheaded efforts to improve the lives of Muslim women through literacy and educational campaigns, and controversially, through compulsory \"de-veiling\" campaigns.\n\nThe Zhenotdel persuaded the Bolsheviks to legalise abortion (as a 'temporary measure'). The Bolsheviks legalised aborting in November 1920. This was the first time in world history that women had won the right to free abortions in state hospitals.\n\nThe leaders of the Zhenotdel were committed communists, and worked as part of the Soviet state apparatus. Historian Elizabeth Wood has argued that the organization took an active interest in women's problems, and initially served as a conduit for women's issues from the people to the state. The Zhenotdel was shut down in 1930, in accordance with the then-dominant theory among the members of the Zhenotdel that all women's issues in the Soviet Union had been \"solved\" by the eradication of private property and the nationalization of the means of production.\n\nZhenotdel had five leaders during its 11 years of existence:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first GSX models were introduced in 1980 and represented the next step in Suzuki's four-stroke road bike range after the two-valve GS Series. \n\nIn North America though, the Suzuki four-valve and two-valve four-stroke road bikes were both designated as \"Suzuki GS\" motorcycles.<br>\nThe two-valve engines remained in production in parallel with the four-valve power plants, the larger two-valve four-cylinder engines gaining shaft-drive and being used to power Suzuki's more touring-orientated bikes such as the GS 850G and GS 1100G, while the GSX series represented performance orientation. \n\nThe two-valve GS Series was Suzuki's first real foray into four-stroke motorcycles. Although Suzuki produced 90cc and 123cc four-stroke single cylinder road bikes under the brand Colleda in the mid-1950s, up until 1976 Suzuki was primarily a builder of two-stroke motorcycles. Suzuki's range of road going motorcycles was almost entirely two-stroke in the mid-1970s (the oddball being the Wankel Rotary powered RE-5). The sophisticated Suzuki GT series and the flagship 750cc water-cooled, posi-lube lubricated, three-cylinder two-stroke GT750 characterizing the breed. The GS750 introduced in 1976, along with the parallel-twin GS400, was Suzuki's first large multi-cylinder four-stroke motorcycle. The GS was Suzuki's version of what was and is referred to as a Universal Japanese Motorcycle, so common was this 4-cylinder four-stroke configuration amongst the Japanese manufacturers at the time. The 63 bhp air-cooled, twin-cam, in-line four cylinder, GS750 road bike set the pattern for the GS/GSX range until the birth of the first of the race-replicas, the 1985 air/oil-cooled Suzuki GSX-R750. The GS750 two-valve engine showed the influence of Suzuki's long history of two-stroke design and manufacture; the new four-strokes sporting pressed together roller bearing crank-shafts universally used in two-stroke bottom ends.\n\nThe key feature of the GSX engine was the change from the common two-valve per cylinder hemispherical combustion chamber with domed piston design of the GS engine, to a four-valve per cylinder Twin Swirl Combustion Chamber (TSCC) with flat topped piston design. The TSCC design was essentially a modification of the Pent-roof combustion chamber design to which was added a slightly raised ridge running along the combustion chamber roof parallel to the gas flow of the inlet charge. This was to encourage controlled swirl of the incoming fuel-air charge in order to increase the fuel burn speed through better flame front propagation. The higher burn speed, coupled with lowered heat loss from the shallower combustion chambers created by comparatively narrow included valve angles and the flat topped piston meant that the GSX engines produced more power and torque than the same sized GS mills.\n\nThe other major difference with the first GSX engines was the move from direct overhead cam actuation of the valve by shim and bucket of the GS engines, to valve actuation via short forked rocker arms in the GSX -the valves stems and springs being located inboard from the camshafts due to the reduced included angle between inlet and exhaust valves. Apart from the heads the GS/GSX engines were of a common design.\n\nThe current range of bikes by that name are completely different designs that use derivatives of former super sports engines from the early-to-middle GSX-R series.\n\nAmong the earliest GSX models were the two-cylinder \"GSX 250\" and the \"GSX 400\".\n\nThese Suzuki GSX models were the evolution of the GS series of two-valve-per-cylinder air and oil-cooled four-stroke motorcycles. The first four-valve engines were produced for the 1980 model year, but retained the \"GS\" designation for the US and Canadian markets until the release of the GSX-R models in 1986 (1985 outside the US). These GSX engines were based on Suzuki's \"TSCC\" (Twin-Swirl Combustion Chamber) engine design, and shared little with previous two-valve models. \nIn 1999, only for the Asian market, the sport-touring \"Thunder\" GS 250 emerged. Subsequently, to be given the designation GSX in 2001. By 2005, that was then completely discontinued. The Suzuki Katana, which had the same \"TSCC\" engine design but, with the designation of GSX-S. Although, that had little in common with the more modern GSX-F Katanas which are, like the previously mentioned \"Thunder\", sport-touring bikes.\n\nThe TSCC engine was once again redesigned in 1983 with the introduction of a completely new \"GSX 750\", Suzuki's first modern mono-shocked sportbike in both a naked \"(GSX 750E)\" and half-faired \"(GSX 750ES)\" version. Although this bike received solid reviews from testing magazines (and came to be the testers' preferred 750 sport machine for the year), its release was an ill-timed duel against Honda's all-new V4 engine in the form of the VF750 Interceptor.\n\nThe 1983 \"GSX 750ES\" had air-adjustable anti-dive forks, preload and compression-adjustable rear mono-shock (\"Full-Floater\"), disc brakes at both ends, a fuel gauge and digital gear indicator. More significantly, the 83 GSX750 was Suzuki's first mass appeal motorcycle to sport a 16\" front wheel in place of the previous models 19\" wheel. The 16\" wheel making its production debut on a Suzuki with the GS650 Turbo. The 16\" front wheel was a development used in early to mid 1980s 500cc GP motorcycles at the time to quicken steering at high speeds by reducing the gyroscopic effect and shortening/widening the front tyre contact patch. On the road the 16\" wheel proved unpopular and quickly fell out of favour due to its instability on bumpy road surfaces. \n\nIn 1984 the U.S. market received the \"GS 700\" - a bike with a de-stroked engine and minor cosmetic differences due to the imposition by the U.S. Government of a 50% tariff on all imported motorcycles displacing more than 700cc (repealed in 1988). All other markets continued to receive 750cc models. Modifications in 700cc guise included taller pistons and slightly differing cam lift and timing. This plus a change in factory gear ratios enabled Suzuki to produce a US-only motorcycle with near-identical performance specifications to the \"GSX 750ES\", even though engine displacement was 15 per cent smaller. The 50 per cent tariff was the reason behind the glut of de-stroked 650 cc and 700 cc Japanese motorcycles sold in the US in the mid-1980s - unique to the U.S. - and is also the reason the GSX-R debuted in the U.S. a full year later than the rest of the world. It was available as the naked \"GS 700E\" and as the \"GS 700ES\" with bikini fairing.\n\nOutside the US market the \"GSX 750S Katana\" was completely restyled in 1984 sharing the same engine and 16\" front wheel chassis of the ES. 1984 also saw the release of completely new \"GSX-R 750\" signaled a new direction of race-replica sport bikes. The GSX range being relegated from the role of flag-ship models in the Suzuki range. 1984 also saw an update in color schemes for the \"GSX 750ES\" in the rest of the world, with the naked \"\"E\"\" being dropped in favor of the half-faired \"\"ES\"\" and a new \"\"EF\"\" model with full upper and lower sport fairings (never available as a factory option in the US).\nThe \"GSX 750E\" lived on for a few more years, but was eventually superseded by the sport-touring orientated GSX-F series, marketed in the US as \"Katanas\". The original Hans Muth designed GSX-S Katanas were also dropped from Suzuki's global lineup by the mid-1980s, with sporting/racing duties better served by the lighter SACs (Suzuki Advanced Cooling System) air/oil-cooled GSX-Rs.\nThe \"GSX 1100\" lived on with significant styling changes for the 1984 model year with the addition of a 16\" front end, including a full-faired 124 bhp monster of a musclebike, the \"GSX 1100EFE\" (US: \"GS1150EF\"). The larger bikes, although still sought-after as classic superbikes, were also replaced by the GSX-F (\"Katana\" in North America only) lineups, based on detuned GSX-R engines with significant body styling changes such as an electrically operated screen in the 1100F, upgraded suspension and braking components, and frame revisions.\n\nThe \"GSX 750S\" (US: \"Katana\") received an updated engine for 1984, along with Suzuki's other big-bore four-valver models. This is the engine that the first Suzuki GSX-R Series bikes were based on.\n\nCurrent GSX models are powered by derivatives of this in-line, four-cylinder engine with four valves per cylinder, which is also used in the Suzuki Bandit Series up to the end of the 2006 model year. They feature a combined air/oil cooling system called \"SACS\" (for 'Suzuki Advanced Cooling System').\n\nThe current GSX series is produced as the \"GSX600F\" and \"GSX750F\" faired sport touring models, now in their second generations, and the unfaired, twin-shock GSX 750 and GSX 1400 models.\n\nThe bike was used to win the 2007 Endurance FIM World Championship.\n\nThe GSX650F, produced from 2008, is essentially a variation on the Bandit 650, with much the same specification and components. The additional lower fairing, however, gives it a sportier look similar to that of the Suzuki GSX-R Series (though the Bandit chassis means that it carries 110 lb extra weight compared with a GSX-R), the engine has had a small amount of remapping to encourage revs, and the suspension is tweaked. It also has a one-piece seat, unlike the Bandit.\n\nThe earlier GSX750 and GSX1200 Inazuma (GSX750W and GSX1200W) were offered in Japan and Europe for a short time besides the GSF1200 Bandit to cater for a clientele that went for a more traditional styling and a somewhat higher build quality. When they proved sufficiently popular for overseas export, they were quickly developed into the current GSX 1400.\n\nThese modern non-US GSX-models carry little in common with their early to mid-eighties cousins other than a distant ancestor in their powerplant. The GSX 1100S Katana has been reissued as an anniversary model several times for the Japanese domestic market (where the GSX 400S Katana remains a very popular model with styling straight from the early-1980s), and Yoshimura has recently released a small handful of fully re-worked factory GSX 1100S Katana models for sale, requiring potential buyers to win an essay contest before being granted the opportunity to purchase one of these bikes.\n\nThe \"GSX 250F\" is known as the Suzuki Across and is notable as it has a rear petrol tank and a helmet storage area where the petrol tank usually is.\n\n"}

It was released in June 1992 for Atari ST, MS-DOS and Amiga. The player assumes the role of a young peasant named Diermot who has to overthrow an evil sorceress. \"Lure of the Temptress\" is the first game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which Revolution used in the subsequent games \"Beneath a Steel Sky\" and the first two games in the \"Broken Sword\" series. It was received favourably by critics, a commercial success and re-released as freeware on April 1, 2003.\n\n\"Lure of the Temptress\" is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface and a system of drop-down lists, the player guides protagonist Diermot through the game's world and interacts with the environment by selecting from multiple commands.\n\nThe player controls Diermot's movements and actions with a mouse or a gamepad. Diermot can pick up various objects; these can then be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. He can also engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or progress the plot. A few simple action-oriented battle scenes are also included.\n\nA young peasant named Diermot is employed as a beater for the king's hunting party. One night the king receives a note from a messenger, requesting his services to help quell a rebellion in the remote village of Turnvale. As the king's party departs, Diermot's pony follows them, unwittingly carrying him to the battle. When the party arrives at Turnvale they are not confronted by a peasant revolt. Instead they find a band of man-eating Skorl, led by an enchantress named Selena, the titular temptress. The king's men are defeated and the king is killed. In the process, Diermot is thrown from his saddle and is knocked unconscious. The Skorl take Diermot prisoner and imprison him in the local dungeon.\n\nWith help from a peasant named Ratpouch, Diermot manages to escape from the dungeon and visits Luthern, the blacksmith. Luthern reveals that a girl named Goewin who runs a herb shop has recently disappeared. Diermot discovers that she had been arrested by the Skorl. With help from Ratpouch, Diermot breaks into the house of Taidgh, the magician, where he creates a potion which disguises him as Selena. He enters the mansion where Goewin is being held and orders the Skorl to free her. Not long after, a man named Mallin gives Diermot a book wrapped in cloth to take to a man named Morkus. In the process of delivering the book, Diermot sees a notice stating that whoever returns the book to its rightful owner will be rewarded. Diermot delivers the book to a man named Toby, who rewards him with a statuette. Toby reveals that the dragon can help Diermot defeat Selena, but that he will need an infusion made of three herbs to wake the dragon up, which Goewin then makes for Diermot.\n\nDiermot enters the dragon's cave and wakes him up. The dragon agrees to help Diermot, revealing that Turnvale was the domain of a demon long before humans came to the area. This demon should have died along with his breed long ago, but did not perish because it was able to feed on man's greed and ambition in order to survive. The demon was driven out by the great Gethryn, but the young sorceress Selena's meddling with evil has reawakened the demon, and it controls her mortal form. The dragon possesses the Eye of Gethryn, an enchanted stone left by Gethryn at the time of his death. The stone contains the power to defeat the demon, and the dragon then gives the stone to Diermot. A Skorl named Wayne, who turns against Selena, sneaks Diermot into Selena's castle in a barrel. Diermot defeats Selena with the Eye of Gethryn, freeing Turnvale from her tyranny.\n\nCharles Cecil and Tony Warriner had worked together at Artic Computing, an English video game development company. In 1990, they decided that they would set up their own video game development company, together with David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. The four started up Revolution Software, initially based in Hull, with a 10 thousand pounds loan from Cecil's mother. Cecil wanted the game to differ from popular Sierra games at the time, saying: \"While I enjoyed Sierra games, I felt that there had to be more than yet again saving King Graham of Daventry from a – let’s be frank – fairly unlikely series of events. It was all a little bit twee. So we came up with the idea of writing an adventure game that did not take itself too seriously, but did have a serious story – something in-between Lucasarts and Sierra.\" The game was published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment.\n\n\"Lure of the Temptress\" was the first game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which allowed in-game characters to wander around the gameworld independently of each other, performing \"every day life\" actions, which had not previously been featured in a game. It was later used for \"Beneath a Steel Sky\" and the first two games in the \"Broken Sword\" series. The title cost between 20 and 30 thousand pounds.\n\nOn April 1, 2003, the game was released as freeware. The data files are available from the Revolution Software website for download and the game's engine has been added to ScummVM. This version of \"Lure of the Temptress\" was released on GOG.com on December 18, 2008.\n\nUpon its release, \"Lure of the Temptress\" was received favorably by critics, who praised the game's innovative controls and graphics, and compared it to Sierra and LucasFilm games. In 1993, \"Dragon\" gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. \"Computer Gaming World\" liked the game's sophisticated NPC interactions and how it prevented unwinnable situations, but criticized its short playing time. The magazine concluded that \"\"Lure of the Temptress\" is a fine first release from this developer and bodes well for the future\". \"Amiga Power\" ranked it at #47 in 1993, and at #66 in 1994, on their list of Amiga Power All-Time Top 100. In 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the 30th best Amiga game, saying it was \"indeed a revolution\" in the genre. It was also a commercial success, reaching number one in the British Gallup charts at the beginning of July 1992 and remaining in the Top 20 for most of the rest of the year.\n\n\"Amiga Format\" stated that this \"fine adventure game well worth investigating\" could compete with Sierra and LucasFilm games; \"in any event, \"Temptress\" surpasses almost anything Sierra have offered, by being larger, funnier, and a whole lot better drawn ... an innovative system knocks spots of the Sierra-standards and shows LucasFilm a thing or two\" and also praised its humour, saying that there's \"a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humour and fairy-tale nonsense.\" \"The One\" praised the game's controls, saying that \"the game's impressive user-friendliness is undoubtably one of its strong points,\" adding that \"\"Lure of the Temptress\" is every bit as professional and polished as anything the Americans and French have been able to offer us recently\" but \"\"Lure\" is, if anything, a little too serious and sombre\" and that \"LucasFilm's games boast the more interesting characters and interaction sequences.\" \"Amiga Power\" praised its graphics, saying they are \"very pretty drawn, with the dark, moody look you'd expect from a town being oppressed by an evil Temptress,\" calling it \"one of the best graphic adventures ever\" that's \"up there with \"Monkey Island 1\" and \"Beneath a Steel Sky\",\" and adding that the \"only drawback is that it's shorter than your average adventure.\" \"Mega Zone\" praised the game, stating that it is a \"Sierra/Lucasfilmish with really, really good playability. We're talking 32 colours graphics which look really nice, with playability which is really smooth, and simply pure gaming enjoyment here,\" adding that \"the manual is very well written, the sound the graphics are all there, disc access is very good, and looking at the way the whole game is put together right down to the intro it's one of the most amazing Amiga Adventures every written! An Adventure Zone classic!\" Stuart Campbell of \"Amiga Power\" opined that Core Design's rival 1992 fantasy adventure game \"Curse of Enchantia\" (also published by Virgin) was \"a funny version of \"Lure of the Temptress\" with a different plot.\"\n\nAdventure Classic Gaming was less positive in its retrospective review, stating \"what makes \"Lure of the Temptress\" fun—but also annoying—is the game's unique gameplay engine\" and that its graphics \"unfortunately do not hold up well over the passage of time,\" but that many of the backgrounds are \"quite beautiful\" and summarizing by stating, \"While far from being a dull game, \"Lure of the Temptress\" is also full of clichés and stagnant periods of gameplay which ultimately undermine the game's overall enjoyment.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1839335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839335", "title": "Princess Juliana International Airport", "text": "Princess Juliana International Airport\n\nPrincess Juliana International Airport is the main airport on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin/Sint Maarten. The airport is located on the Dutch side of the island, in the country of Sint Maarten. In 2015, the airport handled 1,829,543 passengers and around 60,000 aircraft movements. The airport serves as a hub for Windward Islands Airways and is the major gateway for the smaller Leeward Islands, including Anguilla, Saba, St. Barthélemy and St. Eustatius. It is named after Queen Juliana, who landed here while still only heir presumptive in 1944, the year after the airport opened. The airport has very low-altitude flyover landing approaches, owing to one end of its runway being extremely close to the shore and Maho Beach. There is also an airport on the French side of the island, in the French Collectivity of Saint Martin, called Aéroport de Grand Case or L'Espérance Airport.\n\nThe airport began as a US military airstrip in 1942 during World War II. The following year, first commercial flight landed on December 3, 1943. Queen Juliana visited the island using the airport in 1944. Eventually, the airport was named after her. In 1964 the airport was remodeled and relocated, with a new terminal building and control tower. The facilities were upgraded in 1985 and 2001.\n\nBecause of increased passenger traffic and the expected growth of passenger traffic in the near future, Princess Juliana International Airport is being heavily modernized following a three-phased masterplan, commissioned in 1997.\n\nPhase I was a short-term program in order to upgrade existing facilities and improve the level of service at various points. This included widening, strengthening and renovating the runway, increasing the bearing capacity of the taxiways, construction of a new apron and an upgrade of the (old) terminal. Phase I was completed in 2001.\n\nPhase II included the construction of a radar facility and a new air traffic control tower, the construction of a new and more modern, , terminal, capable of handling 2.5 million passengers per year, and the construction of a Runway End Safety Area (RESA) of , including a overrun, on both ends of its runway, to comply with ICAO rules. The new air traffic control tower and the radar station commenced operations on 29 March 2004, while the new terminal opened in late October 2006. The terminal has 4 jetways for large aircraft like 747s. If traffic develops as forecast, Phase III of the masterplan will be executed, consisting of an extension of the new terminal building and the construction of a full parallel taxiway system.\n\nIn 1994, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and France signed the Franco-Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls, which allows for joint Franco-Dutch border controls on so-called \"risk flights\". After some delay, the treaty was ratified in November 2006 in the Netherlands, and subsequently entered into force on 1 August 2007.\n\nIn July 2016, KLM announced that, starting in October, it would serve the airport with direct flights from Amsterdam instead of the triangle route via Curaçao. The previous triangle route used a Boeing 747. The new direct route would use an Airbus A330. Due to this change, the airport lost its last regularly scheduled Boeing 747 service. The 747 made its last appearance at the airport on 28 October 2016. Maho Beach was almost completely covered with tourists and plane-spotters who came to witness the last landing and departure of the aircraft. In September 2017 it did make a brief return in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, operating some relief flights. At the same time KLM announced the return of the triangle route via Curaçao, this time however operated by an Airbus A330. In September 2018, KLM officials confirmed that they hope to resume direct flights between Amsterdam and St. Maarten by November 2019.\n\nOn 6 September 2017, the airport suffered significant damage when Hurricane Irma struck the island as a Category 5 hurricane. Video from a Dutch military helicopter showed the roof had been blown off the terminal, the jetways were damaged, and there was a significant amount of sand (blown through the fences from Simpson Bay Beach) and flooding on the runway. The airport reopened on 10 October 2017 using temporary facilities while repair work commenced. Pavilions were in use during reconstruction of the main terminal. It was hoped to move the airport’s departure and arrival operations into the ground floor of the main terminal building by November. In December 2018, temporary arrival and departure facilities opened within the first level of the terminal building. The entire upper floor of the terminal and the four jet-bridges remain temporarily out of commission.\n\nThe airport has a single runway numbered 10/28, measuring 7,546 ft x 148 ft (2,300 m x 45 m). It was renumbered from 09/27 in late 2008.\n\nPilots guided by GPS take a more efficient approach than those operating under VFR. Local airport rules prohibit aircraft from flying lower than \n\nArriving aircraft approach the island on the last section of the final approach for Runway 10, following a 3° glide slope flying low over the famous Maho Beach. The proximity of Maho Beach to the runway has made the airport one of the world's favorite places among planespotters despite the dangers. In 2017 a New Zealand woman died from injuries sustained by jet blast from a departing aircraft. Tourists have been often criticised for dangerous behavior on the beach.\n\nThe main apron measures with another on Eastern apron. For freight handling a dedicated apron of is available.\n\nDesigned to handle some 2.5 million passengers annually, the new four-story terminal building offered (at least until the arrival of Hurricane Irma) of floor space and was fully air-conditioned. Available facilities included 46 check-in desks, 10 transit desks and 13 boarding gates. There were 20 immigration booths for arriving passengers and five exit-control booths for departing passengers. The building also featured 40 shops and food & beverage units—some unique to St. Maarten—promoted under the retail theme 'So Much More'.\n\nTo accommodate the growing international and local traffic of private aircraft, PJIA has a fixed-base operator building, offering office space and private lounges with dedicated customs.\n\nSince official opening of the new control tower, PJIA air traffic controllers have two radar systems at their disposal with ranges of and . PJIA controllers manage 4,000 square NM of airspace known as the Juliana TCA around the airport, roughly between and of the St Maarten VOR-DME. Besides providing approach, tower and ground control at PJIA, these controllers also provide approach control for Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport (Anguilla), L'Espérance Airport (French Saint Martin), Gustaf III Airport (St. Barths), F.D. Roosevelt Airport (St. Eustatius) and Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport (Saba).\n\nPJIA is equipped with VOR/DME and NDB. The airport's official operating hours are 07:00–21:00.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1839343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839343", "title": "Pastiera", "text": "Pastiera\n\nPastiera napoletana (, ) is a type of Neapolitan tart made with cooked wheat, eggs, ricotta cheese, and flavoured with orange flower water. It is usually eaten at Easter.\n\nIt was used in the pagan celebrations of the return of the Spring time. During these celebrations, Ceres’ priestess brought an egg, symbol of new life in procession. Because of the wheat or the einkorn, mixed with the soft ricotta cheese, it could come from the einkorn bread called \"confarreatio\", an essential ingredient in the ceremony of the type of ancient Roman weddings named after it. Another hypothesis we may consider is that it comes from ritual bread used, which spread during the period of Constantine the Great. They were made of honey and milk the people offered the catechumen during Easter Eve at the end of the ceremony of baptism.\n\nThe modern \"pastiera\" was probably invented in a Neapolitan convent. An unknown nun wanted that cake, symbol of the Resurrection, to have the perfume of the flowers of the orange trees which grew in the convent’s gardens. She mixed a handful of wheat to the white ricotta cheese, then she added some eggs, symbol of the new life, some water which had the fragrance of the flowers of the spring time, candied citron and aromatic Asian spices.\n\nWe know for certain that the nuns of the ancient convent of San Gregorio Armeno were considered to be geniuses in the complex preparation of the Pastiera. They used to prepare a great quantity for the rich families during Easter time.\n\nThere are two different ways of preparing pastiera: in the older, the ricotta is mixed with the eggs or with the grain; in the newer, thick pastry cream is added, making the \"pastiera\" softer.

{"id": "1839350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839350", "title": "Record-oriented filesystem", "text": "Record-oriented filesystem\n\nIn computer science, a record-oriented filesystem is a file system where data is stored as collections of records. This is in contrast to a byte-oriented filesystem, where the data is treated as an unformatted stream of bytes. There are several different possible record formats; the details vary depending on the particular system. In general the formats can be fixed-length or variable length, with different physical organizations or padding mechanisms; metadata may be associated with the file records to define the record length, or the data may be part of the record. Different methods to access records may be provided, for example sequential, by key or by record number.\n\nRecord-oriented filesystems are frequently associated with mainframe operating systems, such as OS/360 and successors and DOS/360 and successors, and midrange operating systems, such as RSX-11 and VMS.\n\nRecord-oriented filesystems can be supported on media other than direct access devices. A deck of punched cards can be considered a record-oriented file. A magnetic tape is an example of a medium that can support records of uniform length or variable length.\n\nIn a record file system, a programmer designs the records that may be used in a file. All application programs accessing the file, whether adding, reading, or updating records share an understanding of the design of the records. In OS/360 and its successors there is no restriction on the bit patterns composing the data record, i.e. there is no delimiter character; this is not true of all systems, e.g., RCA File Control Processor (FCP) on the 301, 501, 601 and 3301. \n\nThe file comes into existence when a file create request is issued to the filesystem. Some information about the file may be included with the create request. This information may specify that the file has fixed-length records (all records are the same size) along with the size of the records. Alternatively, the specification may state that the records are of variable length, along with the maximum record length. Additional information including blocking factor, binary vs. text and the maximum number of records may be specified.\n\nIt is permitted to read only the beginning of a record; the next sequential read returns the next collection of data (record) that the writer intended to be grouped together. It may also be permitted to write only the beginning of a record. In these cases, the record is padded with binary zeros or with spaces, depending on whether the file is recognized as a binary file or a text file.\n\nSome operating systems require that library routines specific to the record format be included in the program. This means that a program originally expected to read a variable length record file cannot read a fixed length file. These operating systems must provide file system utilities for converting files between one format and another. This means copying the file (which requires additional storage space, time and coordination) may be necessary.\n\nOther operating systems include various routines and associate the appropriate routine, based on the file organization, at execution time.\n\nIn either case, significant amounts of code to manage records must be provided in protected routines to ensure file integrity.\nAn alternative to a Record-oriented file is a stream. In a stream file, in which the file system treats files as an unstructured sequence of bytes. The applications may, but need not, impose a record structure. This approach significantly reduces the size and complexity of the library and reduces the number of utilities required to maintain files.\n\nA common application convention for text files represented as streams is to use a new line delimiter to separate or terminate records, commonly CR, CRLF or LF. Unfortunately, the CPU time required to parse for the record delimiter is significant and the exclusion of the record delimiter pattern from the data is frequently undesirable. \n\nAn alternate convention is to include a length field in each record. The writer application is responsible for imposing any record structure and the reader application is responsible for separating out the records.\n\nA record oriented file has several advantages. After a program writes a collection of data as a record the program that reads that record has the understanding of that data as a collection. Although it is permitted to read only the beginning of a record, the next sequential read returns the next collection of data (record) that the writer intended to be grouped together. Another advantage is that the record has a length and there is no restriction on the bit patterns composing the data record, i.e. there is no delimiter character.\n\nThere is a cost associated with record oriented files. The length definition takes up space. On a magnetic tape that definition takes the form of an inter-record gap. On a disk a meta data area must be allocated. This is minimal in a file where all the records are the same length. On a file composed of varying length records a maximum record length is defined to determine the size of the length metadata associated with each record.\n\n"}

It centres on Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, who live next door to a Jewish couple, Arny and Rosa Goldenstein. The show spoofs elements of mid-20th century American sitcoms and is driven by Hitler's inability to get along with his neighbours. It caused controversy when broadcast and has been called \"perhaps the world's most tasteless situation comedy\".\n\nThe first episode opens with a caption card explaining \"Heil Honey\"s fictional back-story: it supposedly comprises the rediscovered \"lost tapes\" of an abandoned, never-aired American sitcom created by \"Brandon Thalburg Jnr\".\n\nIn 1938, Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun live in Berlin, next door to a Jewish couple, Arny and Rosa Goldenstein. Hitler and Braun have little in common with their historical counterparts, acting more like a stock sitcom husband and wife. Hitler, for example, appears in a golfing sweater and cravat as well as military garb. The Goldensteins are similarly hackneyed characters. The show is a spoof — not of the Third Reich, but of the sort of sitcoms produced in the United States between the 1950s and 1970s \"that would embrace any idea, no matter how stupid\". In this spirit the title, plot and dialogue are deliberately vapid and corny and characters are applauded whenever they arrive on set. Patterned after \"I Love Lucy\", the actors have New York accents.\n\nThe plot of the first episode centres on the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, coming to the Hitler house. Not wanting the Goldensteins to interrupt the visit, Hitler instructs Braun to keep the news from Rosa, which she fails to do. Rosa duly invites herself over with hopes of matching Chamberlain with her dull niece Ruth. Hitler gets the Goldensteins drunk in an attempt to make them leave before Chamberlain arrives, but they stay. Arny and Eva end up leading the visiting Prime Minister in a conga line around the living room while Hitler hides the \"peace for our time\" agreement in the icebox.\n\nOnly the pilot was ever screened, although eleven episodes were planned and eight were recorded in which a story arc involved Hitler's secretive attempts to kill the Goldensteins.\n\nUnlike the pilot episode, the other episodes had animated opening titles, similar in nature to those of \"Bewitched\".\n\n\nThe programme was written by Geoff Atkinson and commissioned by the satellite television channel Galaxy, part of British Satellite Broadcasting (which later became part of BSkyB). It was shown at 9.30pm on a Sunday, after an episode of \"Dad's Army\". During the credits of \"Dad's Army\", Galaxy's announcer said \"And unless Arthur Lowe defeats him, it's the man himself in a few moments in \"Heil Honey, I'm Home!\", as the \"Galaxy Comedy Weekend\" continues.\"\n\nThe programme proved controversial, with Hayim Pinner, secretary general of the Board of Deputies of British Jews describing the pilot as \"in very bad taste\", adding that: \"We are against any trivialisation of the Second World War, Hitler or the Holocaust, and this certainly trivialises those things. It's very distasteful and even offensive.\"\n\nThe television historian Marian Calabro described it as \"perhaps the world's most tasteless situation comedy\". However, some commentators also point out the crassness was intentional, and an element of the parody - among these is David Hawkes, professor of English, who cites \"Heil Honey, I'm Home!\" as a \"heavy-handed concept\", and argues that the show was a failure as a comedy because it \"disastrously exceeded\" the limits of irony.\n\nA video from GarethMarks.com, \"Comedy Showreel\" contains clips from pilot and unshown episodes. Arthur Mathews has said that the production company sent him a copy of the entire series. The filming of the series was cancelled immediately by Sky (BSkyB) on its acquisition of British Satellite Broadcasting. The show is one of the most controversial programmes ever to have been screened in the UK; it was listed at #61 on Channel 4's \"100 Greatest TV Moments from Hell\".\n\nGeoff Atkinson maintains that the aim of the show was not to shock, but to examine the appeasement surrounding Hitler in 1938. He concedes that the satire of this appeasement did not translate as well as he intended. Discussing the furore around the show, Atkinson has also stated that three quarters of the cast were Jewish and did not consider the concept controversial.\n\n\n"}

It was described as a new product in 1896. It is used as an abrasive in finishing and repair work for polishing wood or metal objects, cleaning household cookware, cleaning windows, and sanding surfaces.\n\nSteel wool is made from low-carbon steel in a process similar to broaching, where a heavy steel wire is pulled through a toothed die that removes thin, sharp, wire shavings.\n\nSteel wool is commonly used by woodworkers, metal craftsmen, and jewelers to clean and smooth working surfaces and give them shine.\nHowever, when used on oak, remaining traces of iron may react with tannins in the wood to produce blue or black iron stain, and when used on aluminum, brass, or other non-ferrous metal surfaces may cause after-rust which will dull and discolor the surface. Bronze wool and stainless steel wool will not cause these undesirable effects.\n\nSteel wool is often used for professional cleaning processes on glass and porcelain because it is softer than those materials and is able to scrape off deposits without scratching the underlying surface like common abrasives. In many countries, soap-impregnated steel wool pads were sold under various trade names for household cleaning, although those products sometimes no longer contain steel wool.\n\nAnother use for steel wool is in rodent control. Small holes are plugged with coarse grade steel wool, which, if gnawed on by rodents, causes extreme pain in the mouth and, if ingested, severe internal damage may lead to death.\n\nWhen steel wool is heated or allowed to rust, it increases in mass due to the combination of oxygen with iron.\nThe fine cross-section of steel wool makes it combustible in air. \nLight painting, where many sparks are released, is one application.\nVery fine steel wool can also be used as tinder in emergency situations, as it burns even when wet and can be ignited by fire, a spark, or by connecting a battery to produce joule heating.\n\nSteel wool products are supplied in grades from the coarser grades 3 and 4 to the super fine grade 0000. Rust-resistant (stainless) steel wool is also available.\n\n"}

Its chief town was Limbourg-sur-Vesdre, is today located within the Belgian province of Liège, with a small part in the neighbouring province of Belgian Limburg, within the east of Voeren.\n\nThe Duchy evolved from a county which was first assembled under the lordship of a junior member of the House of Ardenne-Luxembourg, Frederick. He and his successors built and apparently named the fortified town which the county, and later the Duchy, were named after. Despite being a younger son, Frederick had a successful career and also became Duke of Lower Lotharingia in 1046. Lordship of this county was not originally automatically linked with possession of a ducal title (\"Herzog\" in German, \"Hertog\" in Dutch), and the same title also eventually contested by counts of Brabant, leading to the invention of two new Ducal titles: Brabant and Limbourg. \n\nThe extinction of the line of Frederick's grandson Henry in 1283 sparked the War of the Limburg Succession, whereafter Limburg was ruled by the Dukes of Brabant in personal union, eventually being grouped together with the Brabantian \"Overmaas\" territories bordering it (including Dalhem, Valkenburg, and Hertogenrade), to be one of the Seventeen Provinces of the Burgundian Netherlands. Unlike other parts of this province, the lands of the duchy stayed intact within the Southern Netherlands, under Habsburg control, after the divisions caused by the Eighty Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession. However finally, after the failed Brabant Revolution in 1789, the duchy's history was terminated with the occupation by French Revolutionary troops in 1793. These lands were reunited within modern Belgium only after World War I.\n\nThe duchy was multilingual, being the place where Dutch, French, and German dialects border upon each other and coexist at their geographical extremes, both now and in medieval times. Its northern and eastern borders are the approximate boundaries of the modern state of Belgium with the Netherlands and Germany, at their \"tripoint\". The eastern part, which includes Eupen, is the administrative capital and northernmost part of the modern Belgian German-speaking Ostkantonen. The Duchy also included the main part of the Pays de Herve, famous for its pungent-smelling soft cheese known as Limburger or Herve.\n\nThe state's territory was situated in the Low Countries between the river Meuse (Maas) in the west and the Imperial city of Aachen in the east. These lands had formed a very large lordship under Baelen on the route between the important imperial centres of Liège and Aachen. They had chiefly been used for hunting, and not yet developed very much for agriculture. Frederick selected a natural prominence at an important intersection of roads which had probably been called \"Heimersberch\" or Hèvremont, and built his new comital \"caput\" there in about 1030. Kupper has proposed that the new name for this place, Limburg, was taken from the name of the fort of the ruling Salian dynasty who had in about the same period given their possession to become Limburg Abbey.\n\nThe most important towns in the eventual Duchy were Limbourg, the capital, and Eupen. The Limburg estates were commonly divided into five legal districts (\"Hochbänke\"):\n\n\nThe territory of Limburg formed a complex patchwork with those of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, based to the west, the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy to the south, and the County of Luxembourg, to the south. In the east the main neighbour was the Rhenish Duchy of Jülich. To the north were the smaller lordships such as Slenaken, and Wittem and the lordships of Dalhem and Rolduc (Hertogenrade), today in the Dutch province of Limburg, which came under Brabant control and were referred to in that context as the \"Overmaas\" territory, or even Limburg. In the northeast was the imperial city of Aachen.\n\nLinguistically Limburg was situated on the border of Germanic with Romance Europe. While in the northern and eastern districts Limburgish and Ripuarian dialects were spoken, the southwestern part around Herve was dominated by Walloon.\n\nThe territory of the duchy of Limburg was formed in the 11th century around the town of Limbourg in present-day Wallonia. About 1020, Duke Frederick of Lower Lorraine, a descendant of Count Palatine Wigeric of Lotharingia, had Limbourg Castle built on the banks of the Vesdre river. His estates then comprised the districts of Baelen (with Limbourg), Herve, Montzen (since 1975 part of Plombières), Walhorn, and the southwestern exclave of Sprimont. Frederick's eventual successor (probably a grandson) was Henry, although between them was Count Udon, who about 1065 was also called a \"count of Limburg\". (It has been proposed that he married Frederick's daughter, and was the father of Henry.)\n\nHenry also claimed Frederick's ducal title, which was finally acknowledged by Emperor Henry IV in 1101. The Duchy of Limburg, like most of modern Belgium, was originally within the Duchy of Lower Lorraine. For a while, Lower Lorraine had its own single Duke. It is from this Duchy that the Duchy of Limbourg derived its Ducal status (as did the Duchy of Brabant, in a competitive claim to succession). This meant that Lower Lorraine came to have two Duchies, that of Brabant, and that of Limburg, and the title of Duke of Lothier, still held by Brabant, eventually became ineffective. As the Lorrainian ducal dignity was contested the title \"duke of Limburg\" arose, achieving confirmation from Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1165.\n\nThe rise of the Limburg dynasty continued, when Duke Waleran III in 1214 became Count of Luxembourg by marriage with the heiress Ermesinde and his son Henry IV in 1225 became Count of Berg as husband of heiress Irmgard.\n\nHowever, upon the death of Henry's son Waleran IV in 1279, leaving only one heiress Irmgard, who had married Count Reginald I of Guelders but died childless in 1283, the War of the Limburg Succession broke out. The Duke of Brabant won the final Battle of Worringen in 1288, thereby gaining control of the Duchy of Limburg with the consent of King Rudolph I of Germany. Though it shared the fate of Brabant, Limburg remained a separate Imperial State, which in 1404 passed from Joanna of Brabant to Anthony of Valois, son of the Burgundian duke Philip the Bold. With the Burgundian heritage of Mary the Rich, it was bequested to her husband Maximilian I from the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1482. Combined with the \"Landen van Overmaas\" (the lands beyond the Meuse: Dalhem, Herzogenrath and Valkenburg) and Maastricht, the duchy became one of the Seventeen Provinces held by the Habsburgs within the Burgundian Circle established in 1512. Significant towns in Limburg proper were Herve, Montzen, Lontzen, Eupen, Baelen and Esneux.\n\nAfter the abdication of Emperor Charles V in 1556, the Burgundian fiefs passed to his son King Philip II of Spain. The measures of the Council of Troubles implemented by Philip's stern governor, the Duke of Alba, sparked the Eighty Years' War, ended by the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. An area known as Limburg of the States, consisting of parts of Overmaas (but no part of the Duchy of Limburg itself), was ceded to the Dutch Republic. In 1661, the Dutch and the Spanish agreed on a re-partition of the county of Dalhem. The duchy of Limburg itself remained undivided under Spanish Habsburg rule as part of the Southern Netherlands, passing to the Austrian Habsburgs under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.\n\nWhen the region was occupied by the French in 1794, the Austrian duchy of Limburg proper was disbanded and was incorporated into the département of Ourthe, while most of the Overmaas lands became part of the department Meuse-Inférieure, which is the basis of today's Belgian and Dutch provinces called Limburg. After the defeat of the French empire, the eastern, German-speaking part of Duchy's lands were given to Prussia in the Congress of Vienna along with several other territories along what is today the Belgian-German border, but after the First World War, these lands became Belgian, re-uniting the original parts of the old Duchy.\n\n\n"}

The practice grew out of Reich's extension of psychoanalysis to cover what he called \"character analysis\", which involved alleviating a person's body armor and the character defenses that maintain an individual in a state of neurosis.\n\nReich argued that \"the feeling of unity of all body sensations ... increases with each new dissolution of an armor ring,\" leading ultimately to a merger with the autonomic functions of the body. He considered that \"orgone physics reduces the \"emotional\" functions of humans even much further, to the forms of movement of molluscs and protozoa\". After his claim to have thus discovered \"orgone\" or life energy, vegetotherapy was accordingly adapted and succeeded by \"psychiatric orgone therapy\".\n\nSubsequently, neo-Reichian therapists have adopted the body work of vegetotherapy in various forms into their therapeutic practices.\n\nThe practice of vegetotherapy involves the analyst enabling the patient to physically simulate the bodily effects of strong emotions. In this technique, the patient is asked to remove his or her outer clothing, lie down on a sheet-covered bed in the doctor's office, and breathe deeply and rhythmically.\n\nAn additional technique is to palpate or tickle areas of muscular tension, also known as \"body armour\". This activity and stimulation eventually causes the patient to experience the simulated emotions, thus theoretically releasing emotions pent up inside both the body and the psyche (compare with primal therapy).\n\nScreaming and vomiting may occur as the catharsis of emotive expression breaks down the cathexis of stored emotions. While experiencing a simulated emotional state, the patient may reflect on past experiences that may be the source of his or her unresolved emotions. These emotions are described as \"stored emotions,\" and in Reichian analysis are seen as manifesting in the body. Vegetotherapy relies on a theory of stored emotions, or affects, where emotions build tensions in the structure of the body. This tension can be seen in shallow or restricted breathing, posture, facial expression, muscular stress (particularly in the circular muscles), and low libido. Good sexual function and unrestricted, natural breathing are seen as evidence of recovery.\n\nExamples of vegetotherapy, as well as interviews with analysts and patients who have undergone vegetotherapy, can be seen in the film \"Room for Happiness\", directed by Dick Young and approved by the American College of Orgonomy.\n\nPsychoanalyst Otto Fenichel has criticized Reich's relaxation techniques. Although he accepts the fact that there are positive effects of vegetotherapy, he sees two potential problems. First, the possibility of psychological splitting that prevents changes in the body from affecting the mind and second, the need for subsequent working through to integrate the abreacted material into the psyche.\n\n\nOrig. in Reich's Zeitschrift für Politische Psychologie und Sexualökonomie\n\n"}

{"id": "1839431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839431", "title": "Lesbian pulp fiction", "text": "Lesbian pulp fiction\n\nLesbian pulp fiction is a genre of lesbian literature that refers to any mid-20th century paperback novel or pulp magazine with overtly lesbian themes and content. Lesbian pulp fiction was published in the 1950s and 60s by many of the same paperback publishing houses that other genres of fiction including westerns, romances, and detective fiction. Because very little other literature was available for and about lesbians at this time, quite often these books were the only reference the public (lesbian and otherwise) had for modeling what lesbians were. Stephanie Foote, from the University of Illinois commented on the importance of lesbian pulp novels to the lesbian identity prior to feminism: \"Pulps have been understood as signs of a secret history of readers, and they have been valued because they have been read. The more they are read, the more they are valued, and the more they are read, the closer the relationship between the very act of circulation and reading and the construction of a lesbian community becomes...Characters use the reading of novels as a way to understand that they are not alone.\"\n\nThese books were sold at drugstores, magazine stands, bus terminals and other places where one might look to purchase cheap, consumable entertainment. The books were small enough to fit in a purse or back pocket (hence both the brand-name and the generalized term \"pocket books\") and cheap enough to throw away when the reader was through with it.\n\nIn the early to mid 20th century, only a handful of books were published that addressed lesbians as characters in relationships with women. Those notable novels were published in hardcover and were as follows:\n\n\nDuring World War II, the military distributed small paperbacks to its forces, causing a large population of Americans to become accustomed to having access to cheap books and thus creating a demand for the same easy access to reading material when the soldiers returned home. As a result, in the years after the war, there appeared a new and often subversive trend in publishing that allowed for books to be written, cheaply produced, and widely distributed using technology previously unavailable. These books were dubbed \"pulp\" fiction because they were inexpensive and usually sensational or low-brow, much like the \"pulp\" magazines of the first half of the 20th century. Pulps were not necessarily \"low brow.\" Many pulp authors are now celebrated with commemorative hardcover editions. These mass market paperbacks, printed and bound on cheap paper, often addressed \"dirty\" topics like drugs, gangs, white slavery, crime, murder, and homosexuality. Because the literature was not respected, it was not censored as readily, although most of the larger paperback publishers were wary of postal censorship, and, for instance, took care not to publish works that were overly supportive of \"deviant\" lifestyles. In terms of lesbian fiction, these books were the only ones available in many locations to people who had no previous access to information or stories that involved lesbian characters.\n\nSeveral publishing houses created special imprints, such as Fawcett's “Gold Medal” division, to satisfy the demand for pulp fiction. Unlike many publishers, Fawcett made a point of publishing lesbian pulp written by lesbians, or sometimes by heterosexual women, rather than by heterosexual men. It made a significant contribution to the lesbian community to have lesbian authors writing more or less authentic stories about what it was like to be a lesbian, as opposed to only having heterosexual men writing stories about lesbians for the titillation of other men.\n\nHundreds of lesbian pulp titles were published between 1950–1969, and millions of copies of each title were often were sold. This was part of no social agenda on the publishers' parts: they were making quite a bit of money. However prevalent the books were, purchasing and reading them for many women was the equivalent to coming out to the cashier. Author Joan Nestle called them \"survival books\" and described purchasing them: \nThe act of taking one of these books off the drugstore rack and paying for it at the counter was a frightening and difficult move for most women. This was especially true during the atmosphere of the McCarthy trials...Although tame by today's standards...these volumes were so threatening then that women hid them, burnt them, and threw them out.\"\nThe first paperback to address a lesbian relationship was published as early as 1950 with \"Women's Barracks\" by Tereska Torrès, published by Gold Medal Books. The story was fictionalized account of Torres' experiences in the Free French Forces in London during World War II. \"Women's Barracks\" sold 4 million copies and was selected in 1952 to become an example of how paperback books were promoting moral degeneracy, by the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials. The Committee concluded their investigation with a report that required publishers to conform to certain moral standards in the content and publicizing of their books, or else face fines or imprisonment. As a result, authors were forced to limit their stories to fit these requirements. However, as the decade went on, publishers became bolder in printing material that might be judged immoral.\n\nAccounting for the success of \"Women's Barracks\", it is not a coincidence that Gold Medal Books published another paperback with lesbian themes, and in fact, eventually published some of the least homophobic books in the genre.\n\n\"Spring Fire\", by Marijane Meaker writing as Vin Packer, is generally considered to be the first lesbian paperback novel, since the plot focused on the relationship of the two main characters, as opposed to the various relationships examined in \"Women's Barracks\". It is also the first modern lesbian novel written by a lesbian. \"Spring Fire\", which was published by Gold Medal Books in 1952 and sold more than 1.5 million copies, is about two college girls, Mitch and Leda, who fall in love and have an affair. \"Spring Fire\" inspired one of the best-known authors of lesbian pulp, Ann Bannon. Bannon wrote to Meaker after reading the novel, and Meaker convinced her to submit her own manuscript to Gold Medal Books for publication in the genre.\n\nThe tragic endings of \"Women's Barracks\" and \"Spring Fire\" (suicide and insanity) are typical of lesbian pulp novels. Meaker was told by her editor that because the books traveled through the mail and anything sent through the U.S. Postal Service was subject to government censorship, publishers had to make sure that the books seemed in no way to proselytize homosexuality. No character was allowed to be both homosexual and happy at the story's end. A character had either to turn heterosexual and end up coupled with a man or, if she remained homosexual, suffer death, insanity or some equally unappealing fate.\n\nThe first exception to this formula, and technically not a pulp fiction, is the 1952 romance novel \"The Price of Salt\" by Patricia Highsmith, published in hardcover by Coward-McCann under the pseudonym of \"Claire Morgan\". It was republished in 1953 as a Bantam Books lesbian pulp fiction paperback. Throughout the genre, satisfactory endings for women who accepted their homosexuality were rare.\n\nHowever, some authors defied the tragic endings. Ann Bannon published six lesbian novels between 1957 and 1962, a series known as the Beebo Brinker Chronicles. Bannon's novels ended happily, which changed the societal perception of lesbianism. Rather than being seen as \"neurotic, frigid, immature, and even psychotic\", lesbians were viewed as warm and loving. Bannon's novels paved the way for social acceptance of lesbianism and the queer sexual revolution.\n\nContent and quality of the books varied widely. Writer Yvonne Keller divides books within the lesbian pulp fiction genre into subclasses she labels \"pro-lesbian\" and \"virile adventures\". Pro-lesbian paperbacks were generally about and by women, featured a love story between women, had fairly well-developed characters, and tended not to feature gratuitous or graphic sexual encounters. Virile adventures were more male centered, perhaps with at least one male main character, and featured graphic depictions of sex. Author Paula Christian described her inspiration to write during this period: \"Contemporary fiction showed such instability, violence, and sensationalism...I simply wanted to show the other side.\"\n\nHowever, the majority of books in the lesbian paperback fiction genre promoted myths about lesbians and lesbianism. Women who are left without men can be seduced and violated by predatory lesbians (usually butch women). The depictions of lesbianism in prison, the military, and boarding schools was a well-used motif. Lesbianism was often linked to other topics that were seen as salacious or shocking at the time: witchcraft, Satanism, bondage and discipline, orgies, and voyeurism. Many “lesbian” pulps actually depict characters who may now be read as bisexual and who end up in heterosexual relationships at the end of their stories. During this time, however, bisexuality was seen less as a permanent identity and more as a stepping-stone to homosexuality or to various forms of sexual promiscuity.\n\nThe vast majority of characters in lesbian pulp were white. Rea Michaels, writer of novels including \"Cloak of Evil\" and \"Duet in Darkness\", stands out as one of the only pulp authors to include people of color and interracial relationships in her books and to have representations of lesbians of color on the covers of her novels.\n\nBarbara Grier, who started Naiad Press, called the years between 1950-1965 the \"Golden Age of Lesbian Pulp Fiction\". Grier republished many of the books in this span in the 1980s under Naiad, and Cleis Press and Feminist Press have again reissued them. Several writers of this \"Golden Age\" stood out for their contributions to gay and lesbian literature and their formation of a lesbian identity prior to the advent of feminism.\n\nAuthors of lesbian paperbacks were both male and female, and often used pseudonyms - the male authors frequently used female names. One retrospective summed up the genre as, \"The vast majority of these lesbian novels were written by men, designed to fulfill straight men's fantasies...But perhaps 40 or 50 lesbian (pulp) novels were written by women, and were also good enough to becoming underground classics...The pulps also reached isolated, small-town lesbians who could read them and see that they were not the only lesbians in the world.\"\n\nAnn Bannon (Ann Weldy b. 1932) wrote six lesbian themed pulp novels from 1957 to 1962 that later became known as \"The Beebo Brinker Chronicles\". The popularity of the books as well as the continuity of characters gave them a remarkable longevity and earned her the title, \"Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction.\" Her books were re-released in 1983 and again in 2001.\n\nBannon wrote: \"Odd Girl Out\", 1957 Gold Medal Books; \"I Am a Woman\", 1959 Gold Medal Books; \"Women in the Shadows\", 1959 Gold Medal Books; \"Journey to a Woman\", 1960 Gold Medal Books; \"The Marriage\", 1960 Gold Medal Books; \"Beebo Brinker\", 1962 Gold Medal Books.\n\nValerie Taylor (Velma Nacella Young 1913–1997) wrote eight lesbian themed novels from 1957–1964, poetry that was published in \"The Ladder\", and several novels in the 1970s through Naiad Press. She became a gay activist, co-founding the Mattachine Society and the Lesbian Writers' Conference in Chicago in 1974.\n\nTaylor wrote: \"Whisper Their Love\", 1957 Gold Medal Books; \"The Girls in 3-B\", 1959 Gold Medal Books; \"Stranger on Lesbos\", 1960 Gold Medal Books; \"A World Without Men\", 1963 Midwood-Tower; \"Unlike Others\", 1963 Midwood-Tower; \"Journey to Fulfillment\", 1964 Midwood-Tower.\n\nMarijane Meaker (born 1927) wrote under the pen names of Vin Packer and Ann Aldrich, as well as serving as a copy-editor for Gold Medal Books. Packer's books were generally mystery novels, but using her Ann Aldrich name she wrote nonfiction books about lesbians that were not overly sympathetic about lesbianism and earned Meaker the ire of the Daughters of Bilitis printed in \"The Ladder\". Barbara Grier once referred to her as \"the evil genius.\" Meaker later wrote books for young adults under the names M. E. Kerr and Mary James.\n\nMeaker wrote: \"Spring Fire\", 1952 Gold Medal Books; \"We Walk Alone\", 1955 Gold Medal Books; \"We, Too, Must Love\", 1958 Gold Medal Books; \"Carol in a Thousand Cities\", 1960 Gold Medal Books; \"We Two Won't Last\", 1963 Gold Medal Books; \"Take a Lesbian to Lunch\", 1972.\n\nMarion Zimmer Bradley (1930–1999) wrote under various pen names, eventually becoming quite popular for her Avalon and Darkover series. For years Bradley refused to admit she authored her early paperback lesbian fiction, and was reluctant to publicly speak about her work on \"The Ladder\".\n\nBradley wrote: \"I am a Lesbian\", 1962 as Lee Chapman; \"No Adam for Eve\", 1966 as John Dexter; \"My Sister, My Love\", 1963 as Miriam Gardner; \"Twilight Lovers\", 1964 as Miriam Gardner; \"The Strange Women\", 1967 as Miriam Gardner; \"Spare Her Heaven\", 1963 as Morgan Ives;\n\"Anything Goes\", 1964 as Morgan Ives; \"Knives of Desire\", 1966 as Morgan Ives.\n\nAnnselm L.N.V. Morpurgo (1934 - ) also known as the founder of the 1950s Unisex Movement, wrote under various pen names, including Carle for \"ONE Magazine\", as well as under A.S. Morpurgo, Diana Carleton Rhodes, Artemis Smith, and presently also under Artemis Smith, Grandma MoseX, and Annselm LNVM. She further collaborated in the arts with her life-partner Billie Ann Taulman (1929-2008), known to \"The Ladder\" as Billie Bruce, whose iconic sketch of Artemis Smith was published on one of the magazine's covers. Taulman wrote one of the chapters in Artemis Smith's \"The Third Sex\" and is now credited in re-issues, which also contain numerous scientific papers on the nature of self-consciousness and gender identity, written by Smith as a professional bioepistemologist. In her 1960s addresses to East Coast homophile organizations meetings in Philadelphia, Artemis Smith originated the \"come out of the closet\" slogan and strategy for linking the gay rights movement to other rights movements in which, as both novelist and playwright, she was also a spokeswoman.\n\nSmith's \"Odd Girl\" and \"The Third Sex\" were published by Beacon Books in 1959 after multiple rejections by major publishers. Unlike former pulp novels, these also contained strong political statements that influenced the formation of the gay rights movements of the late 1950s. Originally titled \"Anne Loves Beth\", \"Odd Girl\" was extensively blue-penciled by the pulp editors. The original version has recently been reissued by the author through 'the savant garde workshop', a service press for The Savant Garde Institute, which also continues to publish her many collected papers, plays, novels, and poetry. Her most important artistic work, \"Testament of Sarah\" (Book I of \"The SKEETS Triptych\". 1967), was originally to be published by Doubleday & Co.\n\nUnder classic pulp fiction, Artemis Smith wrote: \"The Third Sex\", 1959 Beacon Books; \"Odd Girl\", 1959 Beacon Books; \"This Bed We Made\", 1961 Monarch Books.\n\nLesbian pulp novels typically had lurid, titillating cover art. Although many women (lesbian and otherwise) bought and read these novels, book publishers marketed them to men as erotic fantasy. Covers might have a few provocative lines of text meant to draw attention to the sexy and scandalous nature of what was between the covers. Publishers inserted words such as \"twilight\", \"odd\", \"strange\", \"shadows\", and \"queer\" in the titles of these books. Author Ann Bannon has stated that men would read the covers literally, attracted to the art of half-dressed women in a bedroom scene, and women would read the covers iconically: two women looking at each other, or one woman standing, another on a bed, with the trigger words of \"strange\" or \"twilight\" meaning that the book had lesbian content in it.\n\nBannon was appalled by the covers that Fawcett provided for her Beebo Brinker Chronicles. Melissa Sky argues that there was a definitive type for these covers that often displayed illustrations that did not correspond to the material inside. Additionally, the covers of lesbian pulp novels often presented lesbian relationships as dangerous and questioned whether lesbians could really be seen as women, exposing deeper anxieties about the stability of the gender and sexual norms of the 1950s.\n\nFurthermore, the covers often included blurbs on both the front and the back that emphasized the message of the illustration. These blurbs would praise the authors for their bravery in addressing their subject with honesty. They also portrayed the content of the novels as scandalous and sensational, and made it clear that the reader would find sex scenes inside. Additionally, some blurbs were written by doctors, who would recommend the books on the basis of their value as case studies, suggesting that people would read the novels for their educational value and demonstrating the way in which lesbianism was pathologized at the time.\n\nIn 1964, \"Desert of the Heart\" by Jane Rule (loosely adapted as the 1985 film \"Desert Hearts\") and \"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing\" by May Sarton in 1965 were published by mainstream publishers in hardback, both enjoying a fairly successful run. \"Patience and Sarah\" (originally self-published by author Alma Routsong in 1969) is considered the first novel to initiate a feminist publishing run. In 1973, Naiad Press was founded by Barbara Grier which concentrated mainly on lesbian-themed books. The growth of the pornographic industry after a series of United States Supreme Court decisions disallowing the censorship of pornographic material, was evident in books that served to be more graphic in nature than focusing on the relationships of the women in the stories, which also led to the decline of lesbian pulp fiction. Authors March Hastings and Paula Christian both stated their publishers lost interest in their subject in the mid-1960s. As well, common plot points in the books involved women who were coming to terms with realizing their attraction to women in a world that did not allow it. With the rise of feminism, and the gay rights movement in 1969, these plot points were decreasingly relevant.\n\nHowever, certain lesbian pulp novels, including Ann Bannon's books, were reprinted in the 1980s by Naiad Press with the goal of bringing lesbian authors to light. Naiad provided new covers for the books, for example portraying silhouettes of lesbian couples on the covers of Bannon's novels. Melissa Sky argues that, due to the political motivations of Naiad Press, “the cover art betrays a feminist ambivalence towards the kinds of non-egalitarian relationships depicted in Bannon's series,” specifically the butch-femme relationships that were often central to lesbian bar culture of the 1950s. In the early 2000s, the queer publisher Cleis Press again republished Bannon's novels, this time with covers in the style of 1950s pulp covers. Although the cover illustrations were taken from real pulp novels, they were not the original covers of the Beebo Brinker Chronicles. Sky argues that the Cleis versions emphasize the camp quality of lesbian pulp. In 2005 an anthology titled \"Lesbian Pulp Fiction\" was published by Katherine Forrest.Ms Forrest's forward provides further information on the genre and history.\n\nPatricia Highsmith's \"The Price of Salt\" was adapted into the 2015 film \"Carol\" by Phyllis Nagy and directed by Todd Haynes. Starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, it received numerous accolades, bringing a 1950s lesbian \"pulp story\" to a wider modern audience.\n\nIn much the same way as publication of the 1950s/1960s pulp novels was made possible by new technology, another wave of lesbian literature came into existence due to the new technologies of the 1980s to the present. In the 1980s and 1990s, lesbian fan fiction surged to the forefront with hundreds of authors writing stories, novels, and whole series and making them available online via the Internet. This online publication continues to be popular to this day. In the 2000s, with increased availability of the internet and awareness of the genre, authorship grew into the tens of thousands. Many of the authors who wrote in the 1980s and 1990s gravitated away from fan fiction and began to write original works, and small presses sprang up to publish that work. With the proliferation of offset printing and the subsequent widespread availability of print on demand technology and desktop publishing, for the first time in history, small presses with little capital began to regularly publish lesbian voices. By the turn of the 21st century, over a dozen lesbian fiction and nonfiction publishers had emerged, and they are successfully marketing hundreds of new titles yearly for the lesbian audience. The three largest publishers going into this new millennium are Bella Books, Bold Strokes Books, and Regal Crest Enterprises.\n\nThe development of electronic E-books has made it possible for out-of-print books to be made available again. Many pulp novels have been reissued in e-book form, and most print books published today are also issued as e-books.\n\n\n\n"}

It follows the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River from the border with the state of New York in the hamlet of Dundee (connecting with New York State Route 37 (NY 37) via NY 970T, an unsigned reference route, north of Massena), west of Montreal to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and circles the Gaspé Peninsula. This highway is known as the Navigator's Route. It passes through the Montérégie, Centre-du-Québec, Chaudière-Appalaches, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie regions of the province.\n\nUnlike the more direct Autoroute 20, which it shadows from Longueuil to Luceville, Route 132 takes a more scenic route which goes through many historic small towns. Until the connection between Rivière-du-Loup and Le Bic is completed, this highway provides a link between the two sections of Autoroute 20. At Rivière-du-Loup, the Trans-Canada Highway continues south on Autoroute 85 to Edmundston, New Brunswick. This eastern section of the highway, from Rivière-du-Loup towards Gaspé, was the former Route 6, until the early 1970s realignment of route numbers into a grid.\n\nAt Sainte-Flavie, the highway splits and one branch turns south following the valley of the Matapédia River to reach the New Brunswick border near Campbellton, joining Route 11 (Which provides access to Maine and Interstate 95). The other branch continues east to follow the coast of the Gaspé peninsula and eventually rejoin the other branch at Matapédia. The total length of this loop is over 930 km.\n\nBetween Candiac and Varennes, the highway overlaps various current and former Quebec Autoroutes and can be considered a continuous autoroute by itself, as it runs along the Saint Lawrence River through most of this section. Highway 132 joins Autoroute 15 in Candiac at its Exit 42 and overlaps it until Exit 53 (on the other side Exit 75 of Autoroute 20), in Brossard, where Autoroute 15 separates onto Champlain Bridge. There, Highway 132 begins its overlap with Autoroute 20 until Boucherville, where Autoroute 20 splits off onto Autoroute Jean-Lesage. From that point, Highway 132 continues to the east of Boucherville as a four-lane expressway formerly known as Autoroute 430 and downgrades to a two-lane highway in Varennes.\n\n\n\n"}

During the early 1990s he was also the leader of the far-right political organization \"Mişcarea pentru România\" (\"The movement for Romania\").\n\nMunteanu was the leader of the Students' League, which was one of organizers of the protests against Ion Iliescu's rule. On June 14, 1990, he was severely beaten. A miner was later imprisoned for attempted murder following witnesses' declarations that he had tried to kill Munteanu using an axe. He was arrested and detained at Jilava between June 18 and August 2, 1990.\n\nAs a leader of \"Mișcarea pentru România\" (defunct since 1996), he wrote several articles expressing his admiration for the Iron Guard, a local fascist movement active before World War II. Consequently, he has been condemned for antisemitic discourse by various public figures, notably literary critic Nicolae Manolescu.

The proposal was regarded as controversial at best, coming after the previous candidate, Ludovic Orban, was withdrawn as a result of his prosecution for corruption by the National Anticorruption Directorate. Soon after, documents surfaced on the Internet indicating Munteanu as a former collaborator of the \"Securitate\", Nicolae Ceaușescu's secret police, having signed an agreement for furnishing information and being paid for. He was approached by the secret police after he became a confidante of Petre Țuțea, with the purpose of keeping under surveillance the former anticommunist. Munteanu refused to sign an official proof of integrity document, as required to candidates for public positions. Several organizations and even the National Liberal Party have filed official requests with the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS), to check the ties he might have had with the \"Securitate\" before 1989. Following public outcry, the National Liberals decided to drop him as party candidate.\n\nLater in 2016 Munteanu created a new political movement in order to run in the elections for the Parliament.\n\n"}

TUS is a subsidiary of Thales Naval, part of the Thales Group, and has sites in the United Kingdom, France, and Australia. TUS is made up of three subsidiary companies: TUS Ltd. in the UK, TUS SAS in France and TUS Pty. in Australia, but it operates as a single company with headquarters in southern France. TUS had annual sales of €400 million in 2006 and employed around 2,100 people.\n\nTUS Ltd. has two main sites, Cheadle Heath near Stockport, Greater Manchester and Templecombe in Somerset. The company had a turnover of around £85 million with a total of 853 staff in 2006.\n\nThe Cheadle Heath site was set up in 1977 as an overspill of the Ferranti Military Systems Division based at Wythenshawe. It comprised groups covering training simulators, communication systems and a small Underwater Systems Group which was engaged in the development of displays and computer interfaces for sonars equipment. The main parts of these sonars were developed by the Plessey Marine Research Unit at Templecombe, Somerset.\n\nThe sonar work at the Cheadle Heath site expanded into digital signal processing, algorithm development, display generation, simulation, LCD and TV displays, mass storage, computer interfaces and highways. Takeovers of other companies brought new expertise in sonar arrays. The Sonar Systems Group increased in size and successfully bid against Plessey for parts of sonar 2054. Other parts of the Ferranti empire started to crumble, aided by the merger with International Signal (James Guerin) in 1987 to form Ferranti International. Ferranti eventually went bankrupt (again) in 1993, however the small, idiosyncratic Sonar Systems Group had become a successful standalone business. A Joint Venture Company was formed between the Ferranti liquidators (49.9%) and Thomson-CSF (50.1%) to form Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems. The Ferranti share was bought out by GEC-Marconi to become Thomson Marconi Sonar Systems.\n\nFTSS had outstations at Weymouth for aquaculture sonar and other special systems. This is now closed along with its Church Crookham site.\n\nThe site is now a combined focal hypocentre for both the Underwater and Information systems division.\n\nThe Templecombe part of TUS started life in 1965 as the Marine Systems Research Unit of the Marine Systems Division of the Plessey Company, then it became Plessey Marine Research Unit, and Plessey Marine, before becoming Plessey Naval Systems, producing sonar and other related systems. The Marine Systems Division was established in 1961 at Uppark Drive Ilford but originated in a specialist underwater unit formed by the Plessey Company in 1948. The sites at Ilford carried out manufacturing and support of the older sonars, such as Type 195, and the Mark 44 torpedo. A manufacturing and support site at Newport, Wales was set up for later sonars and gradually the sites at Ilford closed. The headquarters of Plessey Marine was transferred to Templecombe.\n\nPlessey took over a company called Ameeco Hydrospace in the 1970s which specialised in building towed arrays. This had sites in Andover and Gillingham. The sites at Andover were eventually closed and the work transferred to Newport.\n\nPlessey Naval Systems was taken over in 1989 by GEC-Marconi, the defence arm of GEC, to eventually merge with Marconi Underwater Systems Ltd.\n\nAfter the sonar systems businesses of Thomson-CSF and Ferranti were merged (creating Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems), GEC-Marconi acquired Ferranti's share, and the company became Thomson Marconi Sonar (TMS). Marconi Underwater Systems Ltd became a part of this company.\n\nIn 1999, as part of the merger of Marconi Electronic Systems (as GEC-Marconi had become), and British Aerospace, the new BAE Systems held 49.9% of TMS, which it sold to Thales (the new name for Thomson-CSF) in 2001. Thomson Marconi Sonar was renamed Thales Underwater Systems and the original part of MUSL became part of BAE Systems. The UK headquarters of TUS is at Templecombe.\n\nThe original site at Templecombe was at Wilkinthroop House and later because of expansion a site at Throop Road was added. The Throop Road site was previously the railyard of the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The other railway line from London to Exeter, which the line joined linked to is still operational, and Templecombe station is still used today.\n\nBecause of restrictions at the former site, all work was later transferred to the latter one and Wilkinthroop House sold off. A flooded quarry at Waterlip was acquired as a test site in the 1960s but problems led to testing being transferred to a site at Vobster. However, further problems there led to testing resuming at Waterlip. The Newport site was closed and manufacturing transferred back to Templecombe. In addition there have been sites in Bath (due to the then-proximity to MoD offices in and around the city, now entirely moved to DESG MoD Abbey Wood) for Prime Contract Management and a Joint Plessey Ferranti Office at Portland to support the Admiralty Research Establishment, but both are now closed. Plessey Naval Systems also had a site at Carlsbad California for USN support.\n\nOne of the sites of Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems, but a relatively small site within Thales. The Church Crookham site housed a production and test facility for towed array sonars and submarine flank arrays, a design department, and a special projects section. It had a large involvement in Sonar 2076, and for a period provided acoustic calibration services for naval vessels. Now closed.\n\nThis site specialises in minecountermeasures sonar, sonar buoys data processing and dipping sonars for submarine detection.\n\nThis was the main manufacturing facility until 1995 when it was transferred to Rydalmere. The Meadowbank facility has since closed and has been redeveloped into residential apartments.\n\nThis is the headquarters of TUS in Australia.\n\n\n"}

He spent his entire playing career at Watford before his career was ended by injury at the age of 28. Having moved on to the club's coaching staff, he began his managerial career during the 1996–97 season.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007 he was manager of Swansea City, leading the club to promotion and several trophies. He served as Millwall manager for six seasons, again bringing a promotion, before resigning in May 2013; weeks later he took over as manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers, a position he held until July 2016, yet again garnering a promotion along the way.\n\nJackett was appointed Rotherham United manager in October 2016 before leaving in November. In June 2017 it was announced he would take over from Paul Cook to become the Portsmouth manager.\n\nJackett is the son of professional footballer Frank Jackett, who played for Watford between 1949 and 1953. His son Ryan was appointed caretaker manager of Kings Langley in September 2019.\n\nJackett joined his local club Watford at the age of 12, progressing to make his first team debut aged 18 on 26 April 1980 as a substitute in a game at Sunderland.\n\nHe became a regular member of the Watford side that won promotion to the First Division and finished runners-up in the league in the season 1982/1983 under manager Graham Taylor. In addition, he played in the club's first in only two appearances in an FA Cup Final, when they lost to Everton in 1984. These successes also led to Jackett appearing in the subsequent UEFA Cup campaign.\n\nHowever having undergone a series of knee operations, he was forced to prematurely end his playing career in 1990 aged 28. In total he made 428 appearances for the Hornets, scoring 34 goals, placing him sixth in the club's all-time appearance records.\n\nJackett made his international debut for Wales on 22 September 1982 in a 1–0 win over Norway in a Euro 84 qualifier. He won 31 full caps in total, the final on 27 April 1988 in a 1–4 friendly defeat to Sweden in Stockholm.\n\nUpon his playing retirement, Jackett remained at Vicarage Road and, having already undertaken many qualifications, became a member of the club's coaching staff. In February 1996 he and fellow long-term Watford player Luther Blissett were selected by the returning Graham Taylor to run the first team, while he served as general manager. At the conclusion of this campaign Jackett was appointed as the club's manager, with Taylor then becoming Director of Football.\n\nWatford had just been relegated to the third tier and, although Jackett oversaw a long unbeaten stretch of results the team were unable to mount a serious promotion challenge, ending in 13th place – Watford's lowest position in the league structure since the 1970s. During the close season he was demoted to the position of first team coach, with Taylor once again becoming manager.\n\nJackett assisted Taylor in getting Watford promoted in two successive seasons, as well as being part of the coaching staff during their 1999–2000 Premier League season, which ended in relegation.\n\nWhen Taylor left Watford at the end of the 2000–01 Division One season, Jackett was released on the instruction of incoming manager Gianluca Vialli. Following his exit from Watford he joined Ian Holloway at Queens Park Rangers as assistant manager and contributed towards their Division Two promotion campaign.\n\nAfter three years as an assistant, Jackett left QPR to replace Brian Flynn as manager of Third Division side Swansea City in April 2004. In his first full season in charge, the team were promoted from League Two, finishing in third place, and also lifted the FAW Premier Cup in their last-ever game at the Vetch Field. As a result of these successes he received a two-year contract extension.\n\nA fine start to the League One season followed, putting the team top of the table on New Years Day 2006. However, their form faltered in the second half of the campaign meaning they finished in sixth place, entering the play-offs. The team reached the final and a potential return to the second tier after a 22-year absence but lost on penalties against Barnsley. Jackett did however win silverware for a second consecutive season as the Swans won both the Football League Trophy, as well as defending the FAW Premier Cup. During the close season he completed his UEFA Pro Licence in coaching.\n\nThe following season saw the team struggle for consistency and receive criticism from both their fans and chairman. Despite initially insisting that he was the right candidate to take the club forward, he surprised his chairman by resigning on 15 February 2007, stating that he felt he \"no longer has the 100 per cent support of everybody connected with the club from the fans, the media, the players and the board alike\" and so departed by \"mutual agreement\".\n\nFollowing his exit from Swansea Jackett was soon appointed reserve team manager of Manchester City on 7 March 2007. Later in the year he was interviewed for the vacant managerial post at League One club Millwall after the sacking of Willie Donachie, but initially pulled out of the running. However, on 6 November 2007 he left the Premier League club to take up this position.\n\nAfter a 17th-place finish in the 2007–08 season, Jackett led the team to the play-offs in his first full campaign with the Lions. After defeating Leeds United in the semi-finals to reach their first-ever play-off final, they lost 2–3 against Scunthorpe United.\n\nIn the following season Millwall enjoyed a strong second half of the season, challenging promotion favourites Leeds for second spot and automatic promotion. They fell a point short, finishing third, meaning a second consecutive play-off campaign for Jackett and Millwall. Once again he led the team to the final, where this time a solitary goal against Swindon Town was enough to return the club to the Championship; this was the first time in Millwall's history that they had won promotion via the play-offs.\n\nIn their first season back in the Championship, Jackett led Millwall to a ninth-place finish, with the team in play-off contention up until the penultimate game of the season. During 2011–12 though, Millwall struggled for most of the season, remaining close to the relegation zone until a strong finish to the season won Jackett the Championship Manager of the Month Award for April 2012, and ensured their survival.\n\nJackett once again led Millwall to Wembley in the 2012–13 season, when the team reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup where they lost to eventual winners Wigan Athletic. Although the team had occupied a play-off place around Christmas, they suffered a late season slump and only confirmed their Championship status on the final day of the season, ending in 20th place. Three days after the season concluded he resigned, saying he felt \"the time is right for a new challenge, and also for a new manager to come into Millwall with fresh ideas\". The Millwall board accepted his decision \"with reluctance\".\n\nOn 31 May 2013 Jackett was announced as the new head coach of Wolverhampton Wanderers following the sacking of Dean Saunders. He took over with the club competing at the third level for the first time since 1989, and began his tenure at the club with a goalless draw at Preston. The team went on to record a run of victories which earned Jackett a nomination as the August League One Manager of the Month, and which brought the club their best ever start in a league campaign. Jackett was again nominated for the Manager of the Month Award in October following an unbeaten run where his side earned 10 points from four games.\n\nUnder his command, Wolves gained promotion back to the Championship at the first attempt as League One champions and set a new divisional points record of 103. At the conclusion of the season, he was announced as joint-winner of the LMA Awards Manager of the Year for League One, having earlier won the monthly award for March 2014. He then led the club to a seventh-placed finish in the Championship, narrowly missing out on the playoffs. The following season was less successful as the team finished in 14th place, having failed to mount a promotion challenge.\n\nIn July 2016 the club was purchased by the Chinese conglomerate Fosun International. Although media speculation cited Julen Lopetegui as being Jackett's replacement upon the takeover being completed, the new owners initially confirmed that they planned to work with Jackett after Lopetegui was appointed the Spanish national team coach. However, four days later, on 29 July 2016, the club confirmed that Jackett's contract had been terminated.\n\nJackett was announced as Rotherham United manager on 21 October 2016, following the sacking of Alan Stubbs. He signed a three-year contract with the bottom-placed Championship club. Jackett resigned as manager on 28 November after 39 days and five games in charge.\n\nOn Friday 2 June 2017, it was announced Jackett had signed a two-year contract to become Portsmouth FC manager, after the previous manager, Paul Cook had left Portsmouth in late May to join Wigan Athletic.\n\nIn November 2017 the club announced that Jackett had extended the original contract by a further two years to June 2021. On 31 March 2019 Kenny led Portsmouth to the EFL Trophy final winning the tournament against Sunderland 5-4 on Penalties after the game finished 2-2 in extra time. On 30 April 2019 Jackett's Portsmouth missed out on automatic promotion to the EFL Championship.\n\nSwansea City\n\nMillwall\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nPortsmouth\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1839443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839443", "title": "Disposal of human corpses", "text": "Disposal of human corpses\n\nDisposal of human corpses, also called final disposition, is the practice and process of dealing with the remains of a deceased human being. Disposal methods may need to account for the fact that soft tissue will decompose relatively rapidly, while the skeleton will remain intact for thousands of years under certain conditions.\n\nSeveral methods for disposal are practiced. A funeral is a ceremony that may accompany the final disposition. Regardless, the manner of disposal is often dominated by spirituality with a desire to hold vigil for the dead and may be highly ritualized. In cases of mass death, such as war and natural disaster, or in which the means of disposal are limited, practical concerns may be of greater priority. Ancient methods of disposing of dead bodies include cremation practised by the Romans, Greeks, and Hindus; burial practised by the Jews, Christians, and Muslims; mummification practised by the Ancient Egyptians; and the sky burial and a similar method of disposal called Towers of Silence practiced by Tibetan Buddhists and Zoroastrians.\n\nSome cultures place the dead in tombs of various sorts, either individually, or in specially designated tracts of land that house tombs. Burial in a graveyard is one common form of tomb. In some places, burials are impractical because the groundwater is too high; therefore tombs are placed above ground, as is the case in New Orleans, Louisiana, US. Elsewhere, a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for the socially prominent and wealthy; grand, above-ground tombs are called mausoleums. The socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their corpses stored in church crypts. In more recent times, however, this has often been forbidden by hygiene laws.\nBurial was not always permanent. In some areas, burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space. In these areas, once the dead have decomposed to skeletons, the bones are removed; after their removal they can be placed in an ossuary.\n\nA burial is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. Humans have been burying their dead since shortly after the origin of the species. Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead. It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones.\n\nCremation is also an old custom; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in ancient Rome (along with graves covered with heaped mounds, also found in Greece, particularly at the Karameikos graveyard in Monastiraki). Vikings were occasionally cremated in their longships, and afterwards the location of the site was marked with standing stones.\n\nSince the latter part of the twentieth century, despite the objections of some religious groups, cremation has become increasingly popular. Jewish law (\"Halakha\") forbids cremation, believing that the soul of a cremated person will be unable to find its final repose. The Roman Catholic Church forbade it for many years, but since 1963 the church has allowed it, as long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily resurrection. The church specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed; they do not allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home. Many Catholic cemeteries now have columbarium niches for cremated remains, or specific sections for those remains. Some denominations of Protestantism allow cremation; the more conservative denominations generally do not. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Islam also forbid cremation.\n\nAmong Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some sects of Buddhists such as those found in Japan, cremation is common.\n\nImmurement of corpses is the permanent storage in an above-ground tomb or mausoleum. A tomb is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes. A mausoleum may be considered a type of tomb, or the tomb may be considered to be within the mausoleum.\n\nSky Burial allows dead bodies to be eaten by vultures on open grounds or on top of specially built tall towers away from human sight. It is more ecological to allow the dead bodies to be quickly eaten by the highly evolved vultures than burials in which the dead bodies slowly rot in the soil and are eaten by the maggots and bacteria. Sky Burial is also more eco-friendly than cremation, which wastes dead bodies, requires fuel and produces air pollution. Sky Burials can be followed by optional automatic cremations of the skeletons left behind. Ancient Persians, Tibetans and some Native Americans practiced sky burials.\n\n\"Burial at sea\" in past generations has meant the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean, wrapped and tied with weights to make sure it sinks. It has been a common practice in navies and seafaring nations; in the Church of England, special forms of funeral service were added to the Book of Common Prayer to cover it. In today's generation, \"burial at sea\" may also refer to the scattering of ashes in the ocean, while \"whole body burial at sea\" refers to the entire uncremated body being placed in the ocean at great depths. Laws vary by jurisdictions.\n\nThe concept may also include ship burial, a form of burial at sea in which the corpse is set adrift on a boat. \n\nRarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the elements and to scavenger animals. This includes various forms of excarnation, where the corpse is stripped of the flesh, leaving only the bones, which are then either buried or stored elsewhere, in ossuaries or tombs for example. This was done by some groups of Native Americans in protohistoric times. Ritual exposure of the dead (without preservation of the bones) is practiced by Zoroastrians in Mumbai and Karachi, where bodies are placed in \"Towers of Silence\", where vultures and other carrion-eating birds dispose of the corpses. In the present-day structures, the bones are collected in a central pit where, assisted by lime, they, too, eventually decompose. Exposure to scavenger birds (with preservation of some, but not all bones) is also practiced by some high-altitude Tibetan Buddhists, where practical considerations such as the lack of firewood and a shallow active layer seem to have led to the practice known as \"jhator\" or \"giving alms to the birds\".\n\nA body farm involves a similar method of disposal as an object of scientific study.\n\nIn some traditions, for example that practiced by the Spanish royal family, the soft tissues are permitted to rot over a period of decades, after which the bones are entombed.\n\nMummification is the drying of bodies to preserve them. The most famous practitioners were ancient Egyptians—many nobles and highly ranked bureaucrats had their corpses embalmed and stored in luxurious sarcophagi inside their funeral mausoleums. Pharaohs stored their embalmed corpses in pyramids.\n\nPromession is a new method of disposing of the body. Patented by a Swedish company, a promession is also known as an \"ecological funeral\". Its main purpose is to return the body to soil quickly while minimizing pollution and resource consumption. It consists of separating the body from the coffin, freezing it with liquid nitrogen, vibrating it into small particles, freeze drying it, separating any metals, and placing the dry powder remains in a biodegradable casket in top soil.\n\nComposting turns organic matter into soil conditioner. For human corpses, it can be performed by placing the body in a mix of wood chips, allowing thermophile microbes to decompose the body. In the United States, this method is only legalized in Washington.\n\nDissolution involves the breaking down of the body by solvation, e.g. in acid or a solution of lye, followed by disposal as liquid.\n\nA specific method is alkaline hydrolysis (also called Resomation). Advocates claim the process is more environmentally friendly than both cremation and burial, due to emissions and embalming fluids respectively. On the other hand, many find the idea of being \"poured down the drain\" to be undignified.\n\n\nIn some cases an attempt is made to preserve some or all of a body. These methods include:\n\n\nHuman remains of archaeological or medical interest are often kept in museums and private collections. This practice is controversial (See NAGPRA). In the cases of Native Americans in the United States, possession of remains and related objects is regulated by the NAGPRA Act of 1990.\n\nDifferent religions and cultures have various funeral rites that accompany the disposal of a body. Some require that all parts of the body are buried together. If an autopsy has occurred, removed parts of the body are sewn back into the body so that they may be buried with the rest of the corpse.\n\nWhen it is not possible for a body to be disposed of promptly, it is generally stored at a morgue. Where this is not possible, such as on a battlefield, body bags are used. In the Western world, embalming of the body is a standard part of preparation. This is intended to temporarily preserve the corpse throughout the funeral process.\n\nMany jurisdictions have enacted regulations relating to the disposal of human bodies. Although it may be entirely legal to bury a deceased family member, the law may restrict the locations in which this activity is allowed, in some cases expressly limiting burials to property controlled by specific, licensed institutions. Furthermore, in many places, failure to properly dispose of a body is a crime. In some places, it is also a crime to fail to report a death, and to fail to report the disposal of the body.\n\nCertain conditions such as necrosis can cause parts of the body such as limbs or internal organs to die without causing the death of the individual. In such cases the body parts are usually not given a funeral. Surgical removal of dead tissue is usually necessary to prevent gangrenous infection. Surgically removed body parts are typically disposed of as medical waste, unless they need to be preserved for cultural reasons, as described above.\n\nConversely, donated organs or tissue may live on long after the death of an individual.\n\nIn some cases, a body is disposed of in such a way as to prevent, hinder, or delay discovery of the body, to prevent identification of the body, or to prevent autopsy. In such cases, the deceased is considered a missing person as long as a body is not identified, unless death is so likely that the person is declared legally dead.\nThis often occurs as part of a murder or voluntary manslaughter. In other cases, an individual who did not intend to cause death may still feel guilt about a death (e.g. by involuntary manslaughter or an accident) and may attempt to prevent discovery of the body. This can exacerbate any legal consequences associated with the death.\nOther motives for concealing death or the cause of death include insurance fraud or the desire to collect the pension of the deceased. An individual may commit suicide in such a way as to obscure the cause of death, allowing beneficiaries of a life insurance policy to collect on the policy.\n\nCriminal methods encountered in fiction and actual cases include:\n\nDisposal of this type happens for various reasons, including the main difference between a burial at sea and a burial on land: the difficulty in recovering the body. Sometimes this difference is desired to dispose of bodies outside of the law.\n\nThere may be a number of reasons for this kind of crime. One common reason for this behavior is to dispose of the evidence. The body may be the victim of a homicide, as for example murder or manslaughter. In some cases, the victim may even be still alive and drowning during the process. A live victim is usually restrained to reduce the likelihood of the victim freeing themselves or fighting back, and the body is often weighted to ensure the sinking of the body. The Mafia is infamous for disposing of victims in oceans or lakes with their feet cast in a concrete block. Other variants tie concrete blocks or other heavy objects to the victim. The \"Chicago-style\" method involves wrapping heavy chains around the victim. In Venice, barrels filled with a human body and concrete are occasionally found in the canals. It is difficult to determine if murder victims buried in a swamp are buried in water or in earth. Often, the body is also cut up to reduce the likelihood of reappearing.\n\nIn other cases, the victim may have died from an accident, and another involved party tries to destroy evidence of the accident. There are also cases where a stillborn infant is buried to dispose of evidence of infidelity, or problems with fertility, or the shame associated with unwed parenthood in many cultures.\n\nWhile a corpse properly buried at sea is unlikely to reappear, many criminals are unable to ensure the permanent disposals of a body, and evidence of the body may reappear. This is rarely as spectacular as the freshly caught shark in the Sydney Coogee Aquarium that vomited up a surgically separated human arm, leading to a murder investigation. That victim was determined to be James Smith, but the three murder suspects were acquitted.\n\nMany criminals dispose of bodies in a river, hoping that the body is carried away. However, this method will most likely lead to a quick detection of the body, because the body gets entangled at the side of the river, or stopped at a dam, or is simply seen floating by others. A disposal in large lakes or oceans is more likely to hide the body, but a decomposing body can develop a strong positive buoyancy due to the decomposing gases being trapped underneath the skin. This may bring the body up to the surface, or at least increase the movement across the ocean floor due to wave actions. Many bodies have washed up at the shore. Bodies have also been discovered in the nets or lines of fishermen, and occasionally, bodies are also discovered by divers.\n\nVery cold water with little oxygen may even preserve bodies, allowing for an easier identification, as for example Margaret Hogg, the \"Wasdale Lady in the Lake\" in Wast Water lake in the Wasdale area (see National Trust Properties in England). She was found after 8 years, with her body preserved like wax.\n\n\n"}

(株式会社ローソン \"Kabushiki Kaisha Rōson\", ) is a convenience store franchise chain in Japan. The store originated in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, but exists today as a Japanese company.\n\nThe Japanese company has its headquarters in East Tower of Gate City Ohsaki in Ōsaki, Shinagawa, Tokyo.\n\nIn 1939, dairy owner James \"J.J.\" Lawson started a store at his Broad Boulevard dairy plant in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, to sell his milk. The Lawson's Milk Company grew to a chain of stores, primarily in Ohio. Lawson was bought out by Consolidated Foods in 1959. Lawson's neighborhood convenience stores were common in Ohio from the 1960s through the mid-1980s, selling milk, bread, eggs, orange juice, and specialty items such as deli counter 'chipped' style ham and sour cream potato chip dips.\n\nConsolidated was renamed Sara Lee in 1985. At about the same time, Lawson's stores in the United States were sold to Dairy Mart, a smaller chain of convenience stores located in Enfield, Connecticut. Dairy Mart moved its headquarters to Cuyahoga Falls, renamed the Lawson's stores, and operated the chain as Dairy Mart for the next 17 years. Under Dairy Mart, the chain experienced some controversy. Dairy Mart was sued by the American Family Association, after a Dairy Mart manager in Ohio complained that the company's policy of selling pornography subjected her to sexual and religious harassment. The court case, \"Stanley v. Lawson Co.\", was seen as a test of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court ultimately ruled in favour of Lawson.\n\nIn 2002, a Canadian-based convenience store company, Alimentation Couche-Tard of Laval, Quebec, bought the assets and name of Dairy Mart. (The parent company's French name translates to \"Night Owl Food\" in English.) Most of the former Dairy Mart stores, which were either originally Lawson's stores, or were located in communities in which Lawson's once had a presence, were converted to the Circle K brand. Due to demand from consumers, it was announced that Lawson's Chip Dip would continue to be sold no matter what the name of the store.\n\nIn 1974, Consolidated signed a formal agreement with Daiei to open the first Lawson stores in Japan. On April 15, 1975, Daiei Lawson Co., Ltd. was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of Daiei, Inc., a retail company which also ran a supermarket chain. The first store opened in Sakurazuka, Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture in June 1975. In September 1979 the official name was changed to Lawson Japan, Inc.. The Mitsubishi Corporation became the main shareholder in 2001.\n\nLawson is one of the top convenience store chains in Japan, third to convenience franchise giants 7-Eleven and FamilyMart. All of the usual Japanese convenience store goods, such as magazines, video games, manga, soft drinks, onigiri, pastry roulette and bento are available. Lawson has occasionally collaborated on tie-ins with various companies, including Koei's PlayStation 3 game \"Dynasty Warriors 7\". In celebration of the 25th anniversary of the manga series \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\", a Lawson store in author Hirohiko Araki's native Sendai was remodeled to look like the \"Owson\" store that appears in part 4 of the series. In late 2013, a crossover with All Japan Pro Wrestling saw Triple Crown heavyweight wrestling champion Kohei Suwama appear in ads and even work the till for a photo-op in a Tokyo location. In early 2016, a Lawson-sponsored Power Cube was introduced into the online game Ingress. DDM and Kadokawa's Kantai Collection also tapped Lawson in limited promotional materials, featuring character representations of shipgirls such as Kashima in Lawson crew outfits, whose popularity persisted long after the promo.\n\nTo date, Lawson operates over 11,384 stores. They are found in all 47 prefectures of Japan, as well as China, Indonesia, Thailand, The Philippines and Hawaii (see below).\n\nIn 2014, the company announced plans to open stores specifically designed for elderly consumers.\n\nIn September 2014, Lawson announced it would acquire Japanese chain Seijo Ishii Co. for around $503 million from Marunouchi Capital.\n\nIn October 2016, Lawson announced it was partnering with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. After receiving the appropriate license from the Japanese Financial Services Agency, the move would allow Lawson stores to offer cash withdrawal, deposit and transfer services, over and above the ATM services that are already provided.\n\nIn February 2017, Lawson became a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp.\n\nWith the establishment of \"Lawson USA Hawaii, Inc.\", Lawson returned to the U.S. market, with two locations in Honolulu opening on July 7, 2012. One of the stores is in the Sheraton Waikiki, while the other is in the Moana Hotel.\n\nFurther expansion in both Hawaii and the mainland U.S. is planned.\n\nAs of May 2012, Lawson had solar equipment at 20 of its stores, but the company announced in June 2012 that it would install solar panels at 2,000 of its 10,000 Japanese stores. It was estimated that each store would generate about 11,000 kWh per year. Just under 2,000 kWh of this would go toward climate control and other in-house uses, which would account for about 1% of each store's power consumption. The rest of the electricity would be sold under Japan's feed-in tariff system that came into operation on July 1, 2012. It was estimated that the company's income from the power generated by the 2,000 stores would come to more than 700 million yen a year.\n\nLawson planned to install solar panels at 1,000 stores in the 2012–2013 financial year, and 1,000 more in the 2013–2014 financial year. It chose solar panels from Solar Frontier, along with the same company's online monitoring system, for the first 1,000 stores.\n\nLawson has more than 1,200 stores in China, which are found in and around five major cities: Beijing, Chongqing, Dalian, Shanghai and Wuhan. The Shanghai region is the largest, with more than 800 locations.\n\nIn August 2011, Lawson opened its first Indonesian store in Jakarta. In Indonesia, Lawson is a subsidiary of Alfamidi (PT Midi Utama Indonesia Tbk). Recently, Lawson partnered with JKT48 to launch new products.\n\nIn 2013, Lawson began opening stores in Thailand under the name Lawson 108. The stores are run as a joint venture between Lawson Japan and the Thai consumer goods giant Saha Group.\n\nLawson Asia Pacific and Puregold Price Club formed a joint venture under the name PG Lawson Company Inc. They opened their first branch in Santa Ana, Manila, on March 30, 2015. Under the partnership, Lawson will provide its expertise in convenience store's know-how and product development while Puregold will provide its expertise in product procurement and localized knowledge of retail consumers. They plan to open 500 stores by 2020.\n\nAs of 2019 Lawson Stores do not exist in South Korea. In 1989 after the 1988 Seoul Olympics, some Lawson stores were in South Korea. In 1995 Kolon Group, the parent company of Kolon Industries, bought the rights to Lawson in South Korea. In October 1999 Lotte Corporation purchased the rights to what was left of Lawson from Kolon, and in 2000 the brand was absorbed into the 7-Eleven franchise, which Lotte is licensed to operate in South Korea.\n\n"}
{"id": "1839462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839462", "title": "An American Dream (novel)", "text": "An American Dream (novel)\n\nAn American Dream is a 1965 novel by American author Norman Mailer. It was published by Dial Press. Mailer wrote it in serialized form for \"Esquire\", consciously attempting to resurrect the methodology used by Charles Dickens and other earlier novelists, with Mailer writing each chapter against monthly deadlines. The book is written in a poetic style heavy with metaphor that creates unique and hypnotising narrative and dialogue. The novel's action takes place over 32 hours in the life of its protagonist Stephen Rojack. Rojack is a decorated war-hero, former congressman, talk-show host, and university professor. He is depicted as the metaphorical embodiment of the American Dream.\n\nIn 1963, Mailer wrote two regular columns: one on religion called \"Responses and Reactions\" for \"Commentary\" and one called \"Big Bite\" for \"Esquire\". Mailer also divorced from his third wife Jeanne Campbell and met Beverly Bentley who would become his fourth wife. Bentley had known Hemingway in Spain and briefly dated Miles Davis in New York before she met Mailer. Bentley and Mailer took a long car trip, notably visited an army buddy \"Fig\" Gwaltney in Arkansas, viewed an autopsy of a cancer victim, watched the Sonny Liston and Floyd Patterson fight in Las Vegas, and spent time with the Beats in San Francisco. While in San Francisco, Mailer \"walked narrow ledges, testing his nerve and balance\". They spent several days in Georgia with Bentley's family, and returned to New York in August, with Bentley several months pregnant. Mailer officially divorced Campbell, after he and Bentley were married. These experiences, states Lennon, are reflected in \"An American Dream\" which Mailer began in September.\n\nMailer's has similarities with Rojack: They both attended Harvard, served in World War II, had an interest in political office, and appeared on talk shows. Mailer seems to have drawn on his stabbing his second wife Adele Morales in Rojack's murdering of his wife Deborah. Mailer did not deny these similarities, but stated:\n\nAfter a cross-country trip and having little success with his \"big novel\", Mailer approached the editor of \"Esquire\" with an idea that would make him produce a short novel: He would write eight 10,000-word installments that would run from January to August 1964. The editor agreed, and Mailer announced the novel in his last \"Big Bite\" column.\n\nIn an alcoholic rage, Rojack murders his estranged wife, a high society woman, and descends into a lurid underworld of Manhattan jazz clubs, bars, and Mafia intrigue after meeting Cherry Melanie, a night-club singer and the girlfriend of a highly placed mobster. Rojack makes the death appear as a suicide, and maintains his innocence no matter how intense the scrutiny or severe the consequences. Rojack feels liberated by the violence and imagines himself receiving messages from the moon, perceiving voices that command him to deny his guilt. In the course of the next twenty four hours, Rojack sets his focus against the New York City Police Department, the intimidation of an erratic black entertainer who draws a knife on him, and the gathered political clout of his dead wife's father, Barney Oswald Kelly, who suggests that higher political sources have an interest in Rojack's fate.\n\nRojack vomits over the balcony at a party and considers suicide. He leaves the party and calls his estranged wife Deborah, going to her house after she invites him. Ruta, the maid, lets him in. He notices that Deborah has been drinking. She belittles him in his time of need, and he strangles her on the floor.\n\nRojack has sex with Ruta in her room. He then returns to Deborah's room, cleans up the evidence of murder, then throws her over the balcony making her death appear as a suicide. He tells Ruta that Mrs. Rojack killed herself.\n\nRojack asks Ruta to tell the cops nothing about their encounter. He runs to the street and sees Cherry Melanie, the night club singer, for the first time. He meets Detective Roberts at the scene of the \"suicide.\" Depicted is Deborah's body smashed from impact and hit by a car. They go back upstairs, and Rojack fabricates a story about Deborah having cancer as the cause of her suicide. The police insist that Rojack come downtown for questioning. They meet Lt. Leznicki on the way out. Leznicki and O'Brien badger Rojack on the way to the police department. Rojack learns that one of the cars in the pile-up caused by Deborah was Eddie Ganucci, a mob boss wanted on a subpoena. Later Rojack sees Cherry again. He is drawn to her. It turns out that Deborah actually did have cancer so they release Rojack. Rojack goes to the club where Cherry performs in Greenwich Village.\n\nRojack sits at the bar drinking and listening to Cherry perform. He joins Cherry and her \"friends\" for a drink, verbally sparring with her \"date\" Romeo. She and Rojack flirt and kiss; Rojack gets a call from Roberts who warns him to leave. He has an encounter with Tony, who orders Cherry to sing another set. She sings a hymn so Tony fires her. She leaves with Rojack, they get breakfast, and she invites him to a special place.\n\nThe special place is Cherry's post-mortem sister's old apartment. They have sex, and Rojack realizes he has fallen in love with her. He returns to his apartment in the afternoon and talks with Arthur who informs Rojack that Rojack's television show has been cancelled. He then speaks with Dr. Tharchman who tells Rojack that he must take leave from the college. When later talking to Bettina Gigot he picks up on a hint regarding Deborah concerning her father and daughter. Rojack then meets Roberts at the police station who presents him with three pieces of evidence that seem to implicate Rojack. Roberts presses him for a confession. Rojack refuses and is cleared of wrongdoing. Rojack goes back to Cherry and they make love.\n\nRojack and Cherry talk a bit about Rojack's TV show. Then, Cherry tells her life-story: her dead parents; her brother's incest; \"Daddy Warbucks\" who turns out to be Kelly; her escape from Vegas; her relationships; her two abortions, one with Kelly and one with a man named Shago; her finally having a vaginal orgasm with Rojack; and her premonition of death soon after. Shago appears at the chapter's end and tells Rojack to leave.\n\nRojack and Shago fight. Rojack gets the upper hand and throws Shago down the stairs.\n\nRojack goes to the Waldorf Tower to confront Kelly. Rojack talks with Ruta and Deirdre before eating with Kelly. Rojack confesses to the murder of Deborah, then walks the parapet around the roof of the building, hitting Kelly with Shago's umbrella before escaping. He returns to Cherry's only to find out from Roberts she has been killed.\n\nRojack travels to Las Vegas where he wins big at the tables, paying off all his debts. He imagines speaking with Cherry in Heaven before he heads south to Guatemala and the Yucatán.\n\nThe style of \"An American Dream\" seemed to grow organically from Mailer's \"Big Bite\" columns for \"Esquire.\" His voice, explains Rollyson, is a \"supple first-person\" persona \"punctuated with feisty asides and comic exaggerations\". \n\"An American Dream\" is narrated by Steven Richards Rojack, the novel's protagonist, in \"an edgy, rococo style\" that shows Mailer at the height of his narrative powers.\nAndrew Gordon points out that the events of the novel unfold at a quick pace, compared to Mailer's prior works, writing \"before we are five pages into the novel, Rojack has killed four Germans in a grotesque and graphically violent scene. By the end of thirty pages, Rojack has murdered his wife\". Gordon finds that Mailer tempers the shock of \"An American Dream\"'s violence by using a combination of flashback sequences, playful, heavily stylized language, and an abundance of mythical, fairy tale imagery to evoke an exaggerated, dreamlike psychological fantasy.\n\nWhile Kaufmann likens Mailer's narrative to a medieval allegory in its emphasis on magic and metaphysics, Rollyson suggests it embodies an Elizabethan baroqueness and shows Mailer at his best as a novelist. Kaufmann avers that Mailer borrowed his guiding principle from Marx: \"quantity changes quality\". Mailer blends modern America with Rojack's dream visions, making his narrative akin to the magician's stage show in writing a \"novelist as magician who writes a book filled with effects without any causes\". Even though Mailer himself said he had the intention of writing a realistic novel, his style suggests otherwise. \"An American Dream\" is like something out of Chaucer or Dante, or out of American romance, or that the events created by Rojack do not represent literal occurrences that readers come to expect in a novel. Still, argues Merrill, one cannot dismiss Mailer's serious intentions.\n\nBarry H. Leeds, in his \"Enduring Vision of Norman Mailer\", suggests two primary structural patterns: one is Rojack's pilgrimage from \"damnation and madness to salvation and sanity\" and the other is the geometrical sexual connections shared by the characters.\n\nDearborn calls Rojack the \"quintessential Mailer hero\" as he exemplifies many of the traits and accomplishments Mailer himself as a war hero, a successful politician, a television personality, and a professor of \"existential psychology\". Mailer commented in a later \"New York Post\" interview: \"I wanted a man who was very much of my generation and generally of my type\". Rojack feels that his reality is created by the public and that he has become just a shell, a mere actor, which creates a crisis of identity and precipitates his actions. Like Mailer's Hipster, Rojack does not live until he has experienced death — so his murder of Deborah frees him from his hollow public life and initiates his transformation. It's only through the lowest and most severe forms of physical transgression that Rojack, like Mailer's Hipster is able to begin his journey toward psychic redemption. Rojack's journey reflects a seminal theme for Mailer in the importance of growth by confronting serious existential situations with courage. In a 1963 letter, Mailer defines what he means by \"existentialism\" as \"that character can dissolve in one stricken event and re-form in startling new fashion\".\n\nLikewise, states Dearborn, Rojack believes that in killing Deborah, he has cured himself of cancer, a theme that becomes explicit in the novel's epilogue where \"Cancer is the growth of madness denied\". In a later interview with \"High Times\", Mailer elaborates further noting \"A lot of people get cancer because they were too responsible with their lives. They led lives that were more responsible then they wanted to be. They lived their lives for others more than for themselves. Denied themselves certain fundamental things, whatever they were. . . . Cancer is a revolution of the cells\". Leeds adds that, for Mailer, cancer represents moral failure and is a significant theme in much of Mailer's work.\n\nIt is not easy to accept or to excuse Rojack's ability to escape punishment for his transgression of murder. Often characters cannot so easily get away with murder unless it stems from revenge. Murderer's gambit, whose success requires the approval of the reader, can be applied as a way for the \"novelist to gamble with the reader's empathy in the hopes of either winning greater sympathy or . . . greater interest in the character's situation\". Yet, there must contain more strategical tactics in order to win over the jury. For example, when Rojack murders his wife, he compares it to the killing of the Germans. The juxtaposition poses the question of what is the difference between killing a person in wartime and killing a person in society? Mailer also hints that the narrative is \"framed\" by a dream cloud through the use of the novel's name \"An American Dream\" and the allusion of F. Scott Fitzgerald's story \"A Diamond as Big as the Ritz\".\n\n\"'An American Dream\" was controversial for its portrayal and treatment of women, and was critiqued by Kate Millett in \"Sexual Politics\". Millett sees Rojack as another incarnation of a Mailer protagonist who becomes heroic through the linking of sex and violence. Mailer, she argues, attempts to use existentialism to excuse Rojack's misogynistic exploration as his \"sexistentialist project\". Rojack's victims are women and a black man, appropriate objects of the white male's \"dominant wrath\". Millett chastises Rojack, and by proxy Mailer, for what she assesses as the feigned pretense of radically progressive beliefs that belie his defiant sense of white male privilege, likening him to an old southern Confederate, pretending nobility while lashing out at the encroachment of true progress. Millett notes that \"Rojack belongs to the oldest ruling class in the world, and like one of Faulkner's ancient retainers of a lost cause, he is making his stand on the preservation of a social hierarchy that sees itself as threatened with extinction. His partial Jewish ancestry and his 'liberal' views to the contrary, Rojack is the last surviving white man as conquering hero\".\n\nMillett criticizes Mailer for being almost wholly unique among prominent authors in championing a character who is a murderer, while allowing the offender to escape any accountability for his crimes: \nThe humanist convictions which underlie \"Crime and Punishment\" (the original and still the greatest study in what it is like to commit murder), may all go by the board. Both Dostoyevsky and Dreiser, in \"An American Tragedy\" gradually created in their murderers an acceptance of responsibility for the violation of life which their actions constituted, and both transcend their crimes through atonement. Rojack has some singularity in being one of the first literary characters to get away with murder; he is surely the first hero as homicide to rejoice in his crime and never really lose his creator's support.\nMailer responded to the criticisms of Millett and other feminists in \"The Prisoner of Sex\".\n\nJudith Fetterley criticizes Mailer's treatment of women by his male characters in pointing out that each female character must meet a violent death in order for Mailer's hero to be \"free\". Although power might lay in the masculine hands of those in government and big business, women have a mystical power over men. This power enacts a control over Rojack and only when Rojack rids himself of Deborah does he feel in possession of himself.\n\nAmerican culture, Justin Shaw states, has a tradition in which society expects men to achieve the \"self-made mode of masculinity\". Betty Friedan writes in \"The Feminine Mystique\" that men, in other words, were not enemies but \"fellow victims\" of society's expected and assigned gender roles. His wife's recognition of Rojack in the existing world is shown to have been the link to his masculinity which left him \"a void where his sense of masculinity resided\" when she tells him that she no longer loves him. Rojack then begins his search for an active subject role in a masculine role.\n\nMaggie McKinley argues that Mailer uses \"violence as a literary device that facilitates an analysis of his philosophies surrounding existential freedoms, social oppression, and gendered relationships\". Rojack's violence is not just a result of his masculinity, but from chasing the \"sexual freedom that is often denied by a repressive or 'cancerous' society\". Violence provides a centre for Rojack's \"construction of a liberated masculinity\": \"Rojack seems able to discuss manhood \"only\" through the language of violence\", specifically addressing his view that masculinity revolves around either the repression or embrace of violence.\n\nRobert Merrill posits that \"An American Dream\" seems to suggest violence \"is not an intolerable aberration but an extreme example of life's essential irrationality\".\n\n\"An American Dream\" was first published as an eight-part serial in \"Esquire\", January–August 1964. Mailer announced the serial in his final \"Big Bite\" column, making clear that his serial will distinguish itself from other authors. Mailer writes: \"It's been a long time since anything of this sort has been tried by an author who takes himself seriously\"; Mailer cited Dickens and Dostoyevsky as inspiration. While the serialization proved a challenge for Mailer he writes that the process \"has me more or less pissing blood.\" \"Esquire\"s circulation increased to 900,000 during the serial's first month.\n\nMailer rewrote 40% of the scenes for the novel's release in book form. Dial Press published the book in hardcover, and Dell published the paperback. The novel was edited for book publication by E.L. Doctorow.\n\n\"An American Dream\" sold well and spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, reaching number eight in April 1965.\n\nThe reviews for \"An American Dream\" were polarized, with very few mixed. Conventional wisdom was that the novel was one of Mailer's lesser works of fiction. While critics like Granville Hicks, Philip Rahv, Roger Shattuck, Stanley Edgar Hyman, Elizabeth Hardwick, and Tom Wolfe called \"An American Dream\" a failure, the novel has strong defenders, notably critics Leo Bersani, Richard Rhodes, Paul Pickrel, Richard Poirier, and Barry H. Leeds.\n\nWriting one of the first and most positive reviews in \"Life\", John Aldridge states that \"An American Dream\" \"transcends the conventional limits of blasphemy to expose the struggle toward psychic redemption which is the daily warfare of our hidden outlaw selves\".\nJoan Didion writing in \"Vogue\" called \"An American Dream\" \"the only serious New York novel since \"The Great Gatsby\"\". Conrad Knickerbocker writes in \"The New York Times\" that Mailer \"is one of the few really interesting writers anywhere\", and that \"An American Dream\" \"defines the American style by presenting the most extreme of our realities — murder, love and spirit strangulated, the corruption of power and the powerful, the sacrifice of self to image, all of it mix mastered in booze and heat-and-serve sex, giving off the smell of burning rubber to the sound of sirens\". Since 1965, \"An American Dream\" has been defended by Mailer's critics, some of which call it one of his better novels. Tony Tanner posits that a few critics likely found \"An American Dream\" to be \"outrageous\" due to their perception of it as a simple narrative and not as a surrealist work. Tanner hailed Leo Bersani's review of \"An American Dream\" as a \"brilliant comment on the novel as a whole\" because Bersani recognized the purposeful \"exuberance\" that Mailer used.\n\nStanley Edgar Hyman describes \"An American Dream\" as a dreadful novel and says it's the worst that he has read in years. He calls the novel pretentious and focuses his critique on what he sees as the flaws in the plot, images, and the tropes.\n\n\"An American Dream\" was adapted for film in 1966 starring Stuart Whitman as Stephen Rojack, Eleanor Parker as his wife, and Janet Leigh as Cherry McMahon. Johnny Mandel (music) and Paul Francis Webster (lyrics) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"A Time for Love.\" The film also is known as \"See You in Hell, Darling\".\n\n"}

Its source is near Laxfield and it reaches a tidal estuary between Southwold and Walberswick on the North Sea coast.\n\nThe course of the river passes through agricultural land between Laxfield and Halesworth, flowing through the estate of Heveningham Hall and the village of Walpole before being crossed by the A144 road and the East Suffolk Line to the south of Halesworth. East of Halesworth the river is canalised in places and has a clear flood plain with land being used as grazing marsh. At Blythburgh it is crossed by the A12 trunk road before entering the estuarine section of the river.\n\nThe estuary mouth forms the main harbour area of Southwold and is still an active fishing harbour. The estuary is central to the plot of Peter Greenaway's film \"Drowning by Numbers\", being the scene of the final drowning. The river can be crossed by pedestrians by a public footbridge called the Bailey Bridge about a mile upstream from the sea or by the Walberswick rowing boat ferry.\n\nThe Blyth Navigation canal was opened in 1761 running from Halesworth to the Blyth estuary, leading to the canalisation of the river east of Halesworth. It was insolvent by 1884, partly due to attempts to reclaim saltings at Blythburgh, which resulted in the estuary silting up and partly due to the opening of the Southwold Railway in 1879. The navigation was used sporadically until 1911, and was not formally abandoned until 1934.\n\nThe river gives its name to the settlements of Blyford, indicating a formerly important ford over the river, and Blythburgh. The river's name itself comes from an Old English word \"blithe\" meaning \"gentle or pleasant\".\n"}

His major (without bootlegs, etc.) discography consists of at least 51 studio albums, 36 live albums, 35 compilation albums, 17 box sets, 4 soundtrack albums, 57 singles and 3 remix albums.\n\nDavis' initial appearances on record were mainly as a member of bebop saxophonist Charlie Parker's quintet from 1944 through 1947 and released on the Savoy label. Davis made his debut as a leader in the 1947 sessions featuring Parker, pianist John Lewis, bassist Nelson Boyd and drummer Max Roach. Prestige Records released Davis' major debut album \"The New Sounds\" in 1951. He recorded many studio albums under that record label from 1951 through 1956, as well as \"Blue Moods\", issued by Debut Records in 1955, and three sessions for Blue Note Records. The earliest Davis music released was recorded from April 4, 1945 through August 14, 1947, and reissued in CD format by Savoy Records under the title \"First Miles\".\nFrom 1949 through 1950, Davis recorded twelve tunes with a nonet consisting of other noted jazz musicians including arranger Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan, Lee Konitz, John Lewis, Max Roach and Kenny Clarke. The arrangements for that group were scored for instruments rarely used in jazz such as French horn and tuba. These recordings, which were labeled cool jazz and eventually appeared on the album \"Birth of the Cool\" in 1957 by Capitol Records, marked an important influence on the future jazz. He later signed to Columbia and released \"'Round About Midnight\" on March 18, 1957. His acclaimed 1959 album \"Kind of Blue\" is generally stated to be the best-selling jazz album of all time, although the data are not conclusive. The follow-up album in 1960, \"Sketches of Spain\", went gold.\n\nHe formed his Second Great Quintet in 1964. With the release of \"Miles in the Sky\", Davis permanently abandoned hard bop, instead adopting jazz fusion and avant-garde jazz. In this era he released the studio album \"Bitches Brew\", which was certified platinum, culminating in the long electric jams from the mid-1970s released as \"Pangaea\", \"Agharta\", and \"Dark Magus\". After a six-year retirement, Davis released albums under the Columbia and Warner Bros. labels during the period between 1981 and 1991. These recordings combined jazz with popular music genres as he turned more toward the mainstream. He finished his music career with \"Doo-Bop\", in which he experimentally combined jazz with hip-hop, his discography ultimately being extensively sampled in hip-hop, such as with beats from his 1972 album \"On the Corner\".\n\n\nMiles Davis played In Paris International Jazz Festival in May of 1949, with Tadd Cameron Quintet. This album was released in 1977. \n"}

Ebertin continued to promote astrological research, including medical applications of astrology while non-compliant Hamburg School astrologers were interned by the Third Reich, their books and publications banned.\n\nReinhold Ebertin's main reference text on Cosmobiology entitled \"The Combination of Stellar Influences\", sometimes referred to as the 'CSI' or the 'COSI', was inspired by Alfred Witte's \"Rulebook of Planetary Pictures\" \n. Ebertin's book was first published in 1940 and the most recent updates in the English translation were added in 1972. Ebertin's greatest and most truly original contribution was his research in the field of medical astrology and his addition of more psychological correlations. Ebertin worked with the \"Anatomical Correspondences of the Zodiac Degrees\" as presented in the \"Organuhr der anatomischen Entsprechungen\" of Fritz Brandau.\n\nDue to Ebertin's work, he is sometimes considered the founder of modern Cosmobiology as the term is generally used today (working largely with the midpoint/dial paradigms of Witte), although the term 'Kosmobiologie' had been previously used by Dr Friedrich Feerhow and Swiss statistician Karl Krafft in a more general sense \"to designate that branch of astrology working on scientific foundations and keyed to the natural sciences\".\n\nEbertin's mother, Elsbeth Ebertin, was also an astrologer.

It lies within the civil parish of Templecorran, the historic barony of Belfast Lower, and is part of Mid and East Antrim. Before the Plantation of Ulster its name was recorded as both Whitehead and Kinbaine ().\n\nLocated at the base of Muldersleigh Hill, at the entrance to Belfast Lough, Whitehead lies in a small bay between the limestone cliffs of Whitehead and the black volcanic cliff of Blackhead, with the Blackhead Lighthouse on top, marking the entrance to the Lough. \nWhitehead is about 20 miles from Belfast. On the opposite coast of Belfast Lough, the Copeland Islands, Bangor and part of the County Down coastline, are clearly visible.\n\nIt had a population of 3,802 in the 2011 Census. Whitehead is notable in that there are no streets with the suffix \"Street\" in their name, giving rise to the nickname 'The Town With No Streets'.\n\nIn late Victorian and Edwardian times, Whitehead was a popular seaside holiday destination developed by and visitors flocked from Belfast and the surrounding area each year. \nWhitehead is a Victorian railway village with a well preserved conservation area, including the railway station. It is home to the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland, County Antrim Yacht Club and the Council owned Bentra Golf Course, as well as being the starting point for the popular Gobbins Path.\nThe town also was home to an aerodrome during the First World War which housed two airships.\n\nA pioneering Irish railway engineer called Berkeley Deane Wise took this tourism endeavour to the next level, creating innovative new paid-for attractions that would encourage visitors to use the railway company's services. Just south of Gobbins Path, Wise helped transform the tiny hamlet of Whitehead into a premier holiday resort. He designed and built a bandstand, ladies and gents bathing boxes, a ‘children’s corner’, a slipway and a pavilion with 500 seats.\n\nWhitehead received a silver at the Britain in Bloom awards in 2005 & 2006 and a bronze in 2007 with the local Brighter Whitehead group planting many of the flowers.\nIn 2012 Northern Ireland's only Jubilee Wood was planted at Whitehead to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Blackhead Path was built by the Victorians in 1892, partly funded by the railway company, to attract day trippers and holiday makers to Whitehead which was at the time a growing tourist destination and resort. \nWise also built a new path Blackhead Path along the coast from Whitehead to the lighthouse at Blackhead, overlooking the town, in 1892. To reach the lighthouse he added several bridges and a tunnel. Wise soon had ambitious plans for a much more elaborate path built on sheer cliffs a few miles to the north: The Gobbins Path was about to be born. This free accessible path is a seaside walk past Sunshine House, around Blackhead Lighthouse and along the Irish Sea cliffs of Islandmagee.\n\nIn 2018 Blackhead Path has been closed due to health & safety issues and a possibility of severe landslip.\n\nThe Mid and East Antrim Council will start a full renovation of the whole path. Works are scheduled to be starting in April 2019 and last at least till 2020.\n\nOne primary school exists within the town - Whitehead Primary School. Another school, Lourdes Primary School, operated until June 2011.\n\nWhitehead High School, an all-girls secondary school, was present until its closure in 1986. It is now the site of a nursing home.\n\n\n\nFor more information see The Troubles in Whitehead, County Antrim, which includes a list of incidents in Whitehead during the Troubles resulting in two or more fatalities.

The party emerged from a split in the original Communist Party of Nepal in 1962, representing the pro-Soviet sector of the party. Its main leader until 1983 was Keshar Jung Rayamajhi, who had been the general secretary of the original CPN.\n\nIn 1966 the group organised a 'Third Central Conference', with delegates from 17 districts. The conference amended the old CPN party constitution, adopting 'National Democracy' as the line of the party. The conference stated that the royal takeover in the country had been a backlash for the democratic forces, and called for a united front to be formed with Nepali Congress. Moreover, the conference made a call for the holding of a party congress.\n\nIn 1967 the group held its 'third congress' in Kathmandu (considering the two first CPN congresses as theirs). The congress elected a 21-member Central Committee and a five-member politburo. The politburo consisted of Keshar Jung Rayamajhi (general secretary), Bishnu Bahadur Manandhar, Krishna Raj Burma, Kamar Shah and Krishna Prasad Shrestha. Manmohan Adhikari and Shambhu Ram Shrestha, both in jail at the time, were nominated to the Central Committee. The congress stated that the Soviet Union was the international centre of socialism, and condemned the positions of China. The congress called for a peaceful political struggle in Nepal, and condemned the idea of armed struggle as 'adventurism'. The congress branded the rival CPN of Tulsi Lal Amatya and Pushpa Lal Shrestha as 'extremist'.\n\nWhen King Birendra declared Nepal as a 'Zone of Peace', the party wholeheartedly supported this move.\n\nThe party was able to maintain its unity until 1979. However, there were intense debates inside the party on how to relate to the \"Panchayat\" system. This dispute intensified in 1976, as the King amended the constitution of the country. In the wake of the people's movement of 1979, sharp differences arouse between Bishnu Bahadur Manandhar and Rayamajhi. Manandhar called for participation in the popular protests against the regime, and accused Rayamajhi of favouring \"status quo\". Manandhar branded Rayamajhi as a 'Royalist', due to his membership in the Raj Sabha appointed by the King. In 1981 the followers of Manandhar, a major section of the party, broke away and formed their own Communist Party of Nepal. After the split, Rayamajhi labelled the dissidents as being under the influence of the CIA.\n\nThe party led by Rayamajhi contested the 1981 Rastriya Panchayat election, launching over 50 candidates. None of them were elected though.\n\nTwo years after the split, the Rayamajhi-led CPN held its fifth party congress. The congress, attended by 125 delegates from 32 districts, elected Rayamajhi as chairman of the party and Krishna Raj Burma as the new general secretary. Soon after the fifth congress, divisions reappeared inside the party. Again the participation in the Raj Sabha by Rayamajhi and accusations of his workings with the \"Panchayat\" system were the focal points of disagreements. In September 1983, Rayamajhi was expelled from the party at a national council meeting. Rayamajhi himself was absent at the meeting as well as a least 13 other members of 35-member national council of the party. Rayamajhi's followers regrouped and formed CPN. After the expulsion of Rayamajhi, the party became known as 'CPN (Burma)' (alternatively 'CPN (Varma)' or 'CPN (Verma)').\n\nAfter the split, CPN (Burma) reoriented itself towards leftwing unity. The party developed good contacts with the Amatya-led CPN. During the 1990 Jana Andolan (People's Movement), CPN (Burma) formed part of the United Left Front. During the negotiations for starting the rewriting the constitution after the victory of the movement, CPN (Burma) was clearly amongst the most moderate elements inside ULF. When the interim government and the Constitution Recommendations Commission were formed, CPN (Burma) was left out.\n\nCPN (Burma) had 35 candidates in the 1991 parliamentary election. It got 16698 votes (0.23%), and no MPs. Burma himself contested the Saptari-5 constituency.\n\nThe party had merged itself with the Manadhar and Amatya-led groups to form the Communist Party of Nepal (United) after the 1991 parliamentary election. Soon thereafter, however, Burma split from CPN(United) and re-established his own party.\n\nOn June 28, 2001 CPN (Burma) merged into the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist).\n\nCPN (Burma) upheld the line of 'National Democracy Revolution', a programmatic line presented by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956 and adopted by the 1960 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow. The party saw Nepal as a semifeudal and semicolonial country. As of the 1980s, it considered workers, agricultural workers, poor and middle peasants, middle class and intellectuals as friendly classes, and feudalists and capitalists as class enemies. CPN (Burma) considered restoration of democracy, i.e. freedom of speech, press and assembly under multi-party system, as the main task. Regarding chances in the economic structures, the party favoured gradual reform of the economy of the country. The party identified the contradiction between the people and the \"panchayat\" system as a direct contradiction, and the contradiction with feudalism as an indirect contradiction. Its programmatic documents did not specify a single main enemy of the party. The party proposed peaceful struggles against the \"panchayat\" system, discarding the idea of armed struggle against monarchy.\n\nThe students wing of the party was the Nepal National Students Federation. The Nepal Afro-Asian People's Unity Committee and the Nepal-Soviet Friendship and Cultural Association were linked to the party. The splits in the party affected these structures. NNSF and NAAPUC were divided, whilst the NSFCA remained formally united but the different groups continued to fight over the influence over the organisation.\n\n"}

The force was developed in large measure as a result of efforts by UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld and a proposal and effort from Canadian Minister of External Affairs Lester B. Pearson, who would later win the Nobel Peace Prize for it. The General Assembly had approved a plan submitted by the Secretary-General which envisaged the deployment of UNEF on both sides of the armistice line. The Second United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF II) deployed from October 1973 to July 1979.\n\nUNEF was the first UN military force of its kind, its mission was to:\n\nUNEF was formed under the authority of the General Assembly and was subject to the national sovereignty clause, Article 2, Paragraph 7, of the U.N. Charter. An agreement between the Egyptian government and the Secretary-General, The Good Faith Accords, or Good Faith Aide-Memoire, placed the UNEF force in Egypt with the consent of the Egyptian government.\n\nSince the operative UN resolutions were not passed under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the planned deployment of a military forces had to be approved by Egypt and Israel. Israel's Prime Minister refused to restore the 1949 armistice lines and stated that under no circumstances would Israel agree to the stationing of UN forces on its territory or in any area it occupied. After multilateral negotiations with Egypt, eleven countries offered to contribute to a force on the Egyptian side of the armistice line: Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, India, Indonesia, Norway, Sweden, and Yugoslavia. Support was also provided by United States, Italy, and Switzerland. The first forces arrived in Cairo on November 15, and UNEF was at its full force of 6,000 by February 1957. The force was fully deployed in designated areas around the canal, in the Sinai and Gaza when Israel withdrew its last forces from Rafah on March 8, 1957. The UN Secretary-General sought to station UNEF forces on the Israeli side of the 1949 armistice lines, but this was rejected by Israel.\n\nThe mission was directed to be accomplished in four phases:\n\nDue to financial constraints and changing needs, the force shrank through the years to 3,378 by the time its mission ended in May 1967.\n\nOn 15 May 1967, the Egyptian government ordered all United Nations forces out of Sinai effective immediately. Then Secretary-General U Thant tried to redeploy UNEF to areas within the Israeli side of the 1949 armistice lines to maintain buffer, but this was rejected by Israel. In a decision that proved to be controversial, Thant acted to effect the Egyptian order without consulting either the Security Council or the General Assembly. Most of the forces were evacuated by the end of May, but 15 UNEF forces were caught in combat operations and killed in the Six-Day War, June 5–10. The last United Nations soldier left the region on June 17.\n\nThe second United Nations Emergency Forces (UNEF II) was established by United Nations General Assembly, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 340 (1973), to supervise the ceasefire between Egyptian and Israeli forces at the end of Yom Kippur War or October War, and following of the agreement of 18 January 1974 and 4 September 1975, to supervise the redeployment of Egyptian and Israeli forces and to man and control the buffer zones established under those agreements.\n\nThe mandate of UNEF II was to supervise the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 340 which demanded that an immediate and complete ceasefire between Egyptian and Israeli forces be observed and that the parties return to the positions they had occupied at 1650 hours GMT on 22 October 1973. The Force would use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of the fighting, and in the fulfillment of its tasks it would have the cooperation of the military observers of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). UNEF II was also to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in its humanitarian endeavours in the area.\nThe mandate of UNEF II which was originally approved for six months, until 24 April 1974, was subsequently renewed eight times. Each time, as the date of expiry of the mandate approached, the Secretary-General submitted a report to the United Nations Security Council on the activities of the Force during the period of the mandate. In each of those reports, the Secretary-General expressed the view that the continued presence of UNEF II in the area was essential, and he recommended, after consultations with the parties, that its mandate be extended for a further period. In each case, the Council took note of the Secretary-General's report and decided to extend the mandate of the Force accordingly. In October 1978, the mandate of UNEF II was extended a last time for nine months, until 24 July 1979. \nThe area of operation of the UNEF II was at Suez Canal sector and later the Sinai peninsula, with the headquarters located at Cairo (October 1973 to August 1974) and Ismailia (August 1974 – July 1979). The deployment of forces as of July 1979 was as follows:\n\n\nStationed in Gaza City.\n\n\n\nContributors of military personnel were: Australia (air unit/helicopters and personnel), Austria (infantry), Canada (logistics/ signals air and service units), Finland (troops/infantry), Ghana (troops/infantry), Indonesia (troops/infantry), Ireland (troops/infantry), India (troops/infantry), Yugoslavia (troops/infantry), Nepal (troops/infantry), Panama (troops/infantry), Peru (troops/infantry), Poland (logistics/ engineering medical and transport unit), Senegal (troops/infantry) and Sweden (troops/infantry).\n\nOn August 9, 1974, Canadian Forces Buffalo 115461 was making a scheduled supply flight from Ismaïlia, Egypt to Damascus, Syria when it was shot down by Syrian surface to air missiles. Nine Canadians were killed, marking the worst ever single day of loss for Canadian peacekeepers. August 9 is today commemorated annually as National Peacekeepers' Day in Canada. A monument to this event has been erected in Peacekeeper Park in Calgary, Canada.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Lubomirski family's coat of arms is the Drużyna coat of arms, which is similar to the Szreniawa coat of arms but without a cross.\n\nThe Lubomirski family have been actors in the history of Poland since the 10th century. There are two theories regarding the family's origin. One, by Adam Boniecki, a Polish heraldist, assumes that there were two branches of the family. One settled at the Szreniawa River in Proszowice County while the other established itself in Szczyrzyc County. The time of this division of the family is not known, but most likely it was before the adoption of Christianity by Poland. The Szreniawici family used a similar coat of arms, which means that the two families had the same ancestry. At the time of Mieszko I, the members of the Lubomirski family demonstrated bravery in battle against pagans. For this they were awarded the rank of knight and a coat of arms, which depicts bends of the Szreniawa River in the form of a letter S of white colour on a red background, instead of the Szreniawici cross, with the motto \"Patriam Versus\" (Turned to the Homeland). This coat of arms has been used by the representatives of the family to the present time.\n\nThe author of the second theory of the family's origins is the medievalist Władysław Semkowicz. In his article \"The fellowship and Śreniawa. Heraldic study\" („Drużyna i Śreniawa. Studyum heraldyczne”) he writes that the family used to live on the banks of the Szreniawa River in Szczyrzycki poviat (county), in the area surrounded by the Raba and Stradomka rivers, the Trzciański brook, and the Łososina and Krzyworzeka streams. Semkowicz says that the original territory of the Drużynnici family (ancestors of the Lubomirski, Wieruski, Rupniewski, and Lasocki families) was located there. Semkowicz says that the coat of arms does not show bends of a river, but a curved rod – a sign of episcopal or secular power, signifying that for many centuries before the adoption of the name, the family had exercised significant power. This theory assumes, in its later part, that, in the 15th century, the Polish chronicler Jan Długosz incorrectly ascribed the origin of the coat of arms of the fellowship (Szreniawa without a cross), and other heraldists accepted this view.\n\nThe history of the Szreniawici, or Drużynnici, family is closely linked with the rulers of the Piast dynasty. One of the Szreniawici was a canon at the Wawel court, and people using this coat of arms belonged to the inner circle of Bolesław Śmiały, according to Jan Długosz, in \"Annals or Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland\" (\"Roczniki czyli Kronikisławnego Królestwa Polskiego\"). The oldest document mentioning the Lubomirski family comes from the 11th century. It is in the property section of the Crown Register of 1682 in Kraków. The original no longer exists. There is only a mention in the register under a given year. Successive members of the family took up positions of bishops, for example, Piotr, Archbishop of Gniezno mediated between the princes of the Piast dynasty during the congress in Łęczyca in 1180. The family performed important functions at the court of the Piast dynasty and extended their estates through investing in land, mainly within the territory of the Małopolska province. Jakub Lubomirski served as a borough writer in the 14th century.\n\nPiotr (d. 1480), the heir of Lubomierz, the territorial designation that is the basis of the family name, is regarded as the progenitor of the Lubomirski family. The economic foundation of the family rested on the exploitation of salt mines in Kraków province, the mineshafts being leased from rulers of Poland. The Lubomirski family also established private mines in Małopolska province. Sebastian (c. 1546 – 1613), who in 1581 became a mine administrator of Kraków, was the creator of this economic power. This was the first administrative position in the capital city occupied by a member of the family. While taking up his duties, Sebastian had the support of Stefan Batory. In 1595, Sebastian received the title of Count of Wiśnicz from the Emperor Rudolf II; in 1591, he entered the Senate as governor of Małogoszcz. He opened a private salt mine shaft \"Kunegunda\" in Siercza, which was exploited for about 100 years.\n\nMoney gained from the salt trade allowed the Lubomirski family to lend money to even the wealthiest people in the country. This enabled them to purchase properties or take them over from insolvent debtors. The family built up its economic position over many generations, accumulating assets that they held for centuries.\n\nThe first mentions of the home in Lubomierz were recorded in 1398. The number of family estates, starting with Gdów and Szczyrzyca which the family also possessed in the 13th century, increased significantly. In the 17th and 18th centuries they were located in Lubomierz, Nowy Wiśnicz, Bochnia, Wieliczka, Łańcut, Baranów Sandomierski, Puławy, Rzeszów, Równe, Tarnów, Jarosław, Przeworsk, and Janowiec upon the Vistula, among others. To this day, the castle in Nowy Wiśnicz has been the property of the Family Association of the Princes Lubomirski. Many estates were located in the territories of the largest Polish cities: Warsaw (e.g. Mokotów, Ujazdów, Czerniaków), Kraków (Wola Justowska, Kamienica Pod Baranami), Rzeszów (castle), Sandomierz, and Lvov. Maintaining foreign residences in Drezno, Vienna, and Paris enhanced family prestige. The members of the family were referred to as \"the owners of the bank of the Dnieper River\" because many of their estates were located in what is now Ukraine and Slovakia. The Lubomirski family enjoyed political, military, and economic influence, which was concentrated in the provinces of Kraków, Sandomierz, Stanisławów, and Ruthenia, to eventually cover the whole area of the Commonwealth of the Two Nations. They kept this state of ownership until the collapse of the Polish state, when they were deprived of many estates as a result of penalties for pro-independence activities.\n\nThe Lubomirski family looked to invest by buying large estate complexes. They consciously strived to gather them into one contiguous whole. Territorial expansion began in the ancestral territory located south of Kraków and was directed toward the east. The combined estates reached their largest size at the time of Stanisław (d. 1649). It was the third largest holding in the Republic of Poland, only smaller than the entail of Ostróg and the estates of the Radziwiłł family. In addition to purchasing properties, the Lubomirski family leased rich royal estates, such as the Starosties of Spisz, Sandomierz, and Sącz. Income from the land leased from the king was comparable to that from private estates.\n\nThe family introduced several innovative facilities and processes to their estates. Their arable farms adopted methods of industrial production; sugar factories, distilleries, and factories were built. They also introduced enlightened social practices, such as granting equal rights for subjects, allowing Jews to buy properties in private towns and to build houses, and vesting them with judicial powers.Jerzy Sebastian was particularly involved in the activities of democratization. He believed that the increase in economic rights of all his subjects would make him get richer, too. Schools and hospitals for the peasant population were founded, which were maintained with private family income. The family estates often hired people from the lowest class, caring about their education, offering a place of residence, clothing, and a salary paid twice a year. For faithful service, workers were given ownership of land in perpetual or inheritable possession.\n\nThe family, originally small in number, grew considerably, which led to divisions of material wealth but enhanced political influence, due to having the support of more people in the Sejms, in the Senate, or at the royal court. Members of the family were able to count on the support of their relatives in political or court activities.\n\nThe family split into five major lineages: of Wiśnicz (from Aleksander Michał, 1614 – 1677), Łańcut (from Stanisław Herakliusz, 1642 – 1702), Przeworsk (from Aleksander Michał, – d. 1675), Rzeszów (from Hieronim Augustyn, c. 1647 – 1706), and Janowiec (from Jerzy Dominik, 1665 – 1727). The most numerous was that of Przeworsk, which was further divided into three branches: dubrowieńsko-kruszyńska, równieńsko-przeworska, and dubieńska. Many members of this line are alive now.\n\nThe members of the family served the state as marshals, starosts, governors, and hetmans. Four of the princes Lubomirski held the office of Grand Marshal of the Crown: Jerzy Sebastian, Józef Karol, Stanisław Herakliusz and Stanisław. They were active in the politics, chairing the Sejms, forming a private army, representing the king at the courts Europe. Many times they had a decisive influence on the choice of monarchs. They were defenders of the nobility, who often entrusted the family with their proxy vote at the Sejms and in the election of kings. Although Jerzy Sebastian was Grand Marshal and Field Hetman of the Crown, he supported the nobility in rebellion.\n\nMarriages were also important. Members of the Lubomirski family became linked with equally powerful and wealthy families. It enabled them to extend their private estates, and even take over a part of the estate of Ostróg under the Kolbuszowa transaction of 1753. Stanisław Lubomirski (1583 – 1649) married Zofia Ostrogska; Aleksander Michał Lubomirski married Helena Tekla Ossolińska; Krystyna Lubomirska married Albrycht Stanisław Radziwiłł. Józef Karol (1638 – 1702) was Teofilia Ludwika Zasławska’s husband; Teresa Lubomirska (d. 1712) married Karol Filip, the Prince of Neuburg, and Marianna Lubomirska (1693 – 1729) married Paweł Karol Sanguszko, the Grand Marshal of Lithuania.\n\nIn 1647, Stanisław Lubomirski received the hereditary title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire from Emperor Ferdinand III. The Lubomirski family itself was a candidate for Poland's crown. Grand Hetman of the Crown Prince Hieronim Augustyn was the most serious candidate for the Polish crown after the death of John III Sobieski. Prince Teodor Konstanty (1683-1745), governor of Kraków, submitted his candidacy for the Crown after the death of Augustus II the Strong. Prince Stanisław Lubomirski, governor of Kiev and Speaker of the Radom treasury tribunal, campaigned for the throne in 1764. Lubomirski princes were also candidates for the Czech and Hungarian crowns; Jerzy Ignacy Lubomirski (1687-1753) sought the throne of Hungary. The culmination of these efforts was Zdzislaw Lubomirski's serving as Prince Regent from 1917 to 1918.\n\nThe Lubomirski family was related to almost all the dynasties ruling in Europe, the Capetien, Bourbon, Liudolfing, Wittelsbach, Hohenzollern, and Rurykowicz dynasties. The family is maternally related to the Piast of Masovia family. Zofia Lubomirska was the great-granddaughter of Anna Lubomirska, the daughter of Konrad III Rudy, the prince of Mazovia. Katarzyna Lubomirska (c. 1585 – 1620) was the wife of Konstanty Bazyli II, Prince of Ostróg, who was closely related to Bolesław IV, a descendant of Konrad Mazowiecki.\n\nPrince Stanisław Lubomirski was famous for commanding at the Battle of Chocim in 1621, fought against Turkish-Tatar forces. Stanisław initially took part in the battle at the head of a private regiment, but when hetman Karol Chodkiewicz died, and hetman Koniecpolski was taken captive, Stanisław took command and ended the multi-day battle quickly, with the Turks being repelled on October 10, 1621.\n\nPrince Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski (1616 – 1667) was the only Polish aristocrat during the Deluge to not take the oath to Charles X Gustav. Jerzy gave shelter to Jan Kazimierz on his estate in Lubowla (today’s Slovakia) and launched a counteroffensive of Polish troops. He lent his private army, which fought the Battle of Warka, and recaptured Warsaw and Toruń, which had been occupied by the Swedes. Stefan Czarniecki supported the campaign. In 1660, at the head of private and royal armies, Prince Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski conducted a lightning campaign that ended with the defeat of Russian forces at Cudnów and Połonka. In 1661, a worsening of relations with the king resulted in rebellion. The prince withdrew to Silesia; and, degraded by the Sejm court, fought for his political rehabilitation. His sons succeeded in this matter.\n\nPrince Hieronim Augustyn, a member of the Order of Hospitallers, devoted his life to fighting the Turks, who were considered a cultural threat to European civilization. He defeated Piotr Doroszenko in the Cossack uprising. In 1670, he fought against the Crimean Horde at Bracław and . In 1683, during the Battle of Vienna, his troops were the first to reach the city gates. During the period of the first Republic of Poland, eight members of the family served as generals. Two of them took part in the war with Czarist Russia, which gave rise to the Kościuszko Insurrection.\n\nTo build his numerous residences, Prince Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski (1642 – 1702) hired Tylman of Gameren, later court architect to King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki. Stanisław Lubomirski owned residences in Puławy, Czerniaków, (where he founded a monastery and church of the Bernardines), and in Ujazdów (now part of Warsaw), where, at the end of the 17th century, he built a bathhouse that became the Palace on the Water of Stanisław August Poniatowski, and the Ermitage, which was planned as a place of meditation and relaxation. Stanisław Herakliusz was a friend of many European artists and patrons of the arts, as evidenced by correspondence. He had relations with the French and Spanish courts, as well as members of the Medici family. These facilitated his carrying out a number of missions and negotiations on behalf of the Polish king.\n\nStanisław Herakliusz was a talented author, a precursor of the Polish Baroque in literature. He spoke several languages and made use almost all known literary forms in his works. However, he was interested mostly in the new trends coming from Italy. His philosophical work \"Dialogues of Artakses and Ewander\" entered the canon of the Old Polish Literature and became required reading.\n\nAn example of building in the very centre of Warsaw is a reconstruction of the Copper-Roof Palace (\"Pałac Pod Blachą\"), commissioned in the early 18th century by Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski. The palace, classical in form and situated on the south side of the Royal Castle, was bought by the king himself, in 1777, who later added the library.\n\nThe previous owner of this building was Prince Jerzy Marcin Lubomirski (1738 – 1811), distinguished in service to the Polish theatre. He financed exhibitions of family and European art and organized numerous concerts, balls, and meetings. Celebrations organized by him were a meeting place for artists and aristocrats from across Europe, whild in local memory he was remembered as an organizer of public events with fireworks displays.\n\nPrince Jerzy Marcin was also an adventurer and a member of the Bar Confederation. From 1758, he served in the Prussian and Russian armies. He was barred from political life in Poland by his family, but he went down in history as a lover of music and theatre. In 1777, he financed a production of \"Tartuffe\" by Molière; in 1783 leased the privilege of the theatre and made Wojciech Bogusławski its director. He also opened a ballet drama school for 1000 people.\n\nPrince Stanisław Lubomirski went down in history as an administrator of Warsaw. He introduced permanent street lighting and supported a police unit with his private money. Above all, he wished to care for the health of the Varsovians, wherefore he decided to surround the city, on both sides of the Vistula, with an earthen embankment, initially to protect against the spreading plague epidemic. There were only three crossings in the embankment, by which traffic in and out of the city was controlled. Later, the embankment, reinforced with guns, was used to defend the capital during the Kościuszko Uprising and the November Uprising. Throughout the 19th century, the embankment marked the boundary of the city. By the Act of 1770, Stanisław introduced permanent street names, which greatly facilitated the administration of the city and its functioning, especially facilitating registration and correspondence.\n\nIzabela Lubomirska (1736 – 1816), the wife of Stanisław, rebuilt the Łańcut Castle and collected art and books from around the world. She was politically active; during the revolution, she sheltered part of the French court at her estate in Łańcut. She extended her residences, often employing the latest architectural solutions. She built a palace on her estate in Mokotów, the district of Warsaw that gets its name from her estate, Mon Coteau (My Hill). She was a lover of theatre and laid the foundation stone of the National Theatre in Warsaw, as well as maintaining a number of theatres in her palaces. The notion of theatre then had a much broader meaning than now. It included not only the theatre performances, but also opera, cabaret, and acrobatic performances. For her, Franciszek Karpiński wrote the \"Song about the Lord’s birth\", better known under the title \"God is born\". In honour of her daughter, Cyprian Kamil Norwid wrote a panegyric. Tadeusz Kościuszko set out from the residence in Łańcut, to Kraków, when he incited the Kościuszko Uprising.\n\nThe Lubomirski family, like other affluent aristocratic families, engaged in artistic, cultural, and scientific patronage. At Wiśnicz, Wilanów, the Royal Baths, Łańcut, or Mokotów, they supported private theatre groups, financed artists, funded religious buildings, and maintained their residences. The reconstruction of Wiśnicz castle was planned by architect Maciej Trapola, the castle chapel being decorated with stucco by and wherein Stanisław Lubomirski, who financed the renovation of the castle, installed twenty sacred objects.\n\nMarceli Lubomirski for many years supported the work of poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid. He was immortalized by the poet in the book \"White Flowers\". Józef Lubomirski (1751 – 1817) was a promoter of industrialization and reforms, a capable military commander, and a knight of the Order of White Eagle and the Order of Saint Stanislaus. He supported the Constitution of May 3, 1791.\n\nThe Lubomirski family built private schools for pupils on their estates. They often put schooling in the hands of professionals – the Order of Piarists and the Order of Jesuits. The members of the family founded monasteries, churches, and other religious buildings. Stanisław Lubomirski founded the Carmelite Monastery in Wiśnicz, which is still the pearl of Renaissance architecture in Poland. For many decades, residents of the castle in Wiśnicz contributed various legacies to the monastery. Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski (c. 1665 – 1727) gave to the Pauline Monastery at Jasna Góra many valuable objects, including the sacred vessels. It was on his initiative to build the main gate leading to the Monastery. The gate is called the Gate of the Lubomirski Family.\n\nAfter 1795, the princes Lubomirski engaged in clandestine and insurgent activities against the occupying Russians; and, in consequence, they lost estates. Prince Jerzy Roman Lubomirski (1799 – 1865), the owner of Rozwadów, participated in the battles of the November and January uprisings and organized hospitals for the wounded on his estates. After the collapse of the uprising, his palace became a place where secret meetings of Polish patriots were held. Jerzy was active in social and scientific fields, maintaining a grammar school and poorhouse for the poor and establishing two scientific foundations, one funding the scientific testing of equipment, the other rewarding Polish authors of outstanding scientific works. His brother Adam Hieronim Karol Lubomirski (1811 – 1873) was awarded the Virtuti Militari cross, for participating in the November Uprising.\n\nIn 1883, Prince Henryk Lubomirski (1777–1850) gave his rich collection of books, archive material, works of art, and other antiques to the Ossoliński National Institute in Lvov, which since has become an important scientific and cultural institution, with its 19th-century publications, on the humanities research conducted there, being still considered of value. Without the material and financial support of Henryk, the facility would have closed at an early stage of activity. Henryk for many years served as a curator of the facility. He also contributed to the formation of the Museum of the Princes Lubomirski, the first private museum in the Polish land generally available to the public. He was on familiar terms with poet Zygmunt Krasiński, who memorialized the prince in his \"Non-Divine Comedy\", in the person of Orcio. In 1823, Henryk created the entail of Przeworsk; but, as a result of his subversive activities, the entail was legalized by the partitioning authorities only after his death. In 1869, his son Prince Andrzej Lubomirski became the first recognized entailer.\n\nPrince Aleksander Lubomirski (1802 - 1893) founded centres for poor boys (at today's seat of the University of Economics) and girls (in Łagiewniki) in the centre of Kraków. At these centres, young poor were prepared for adult life, being instructed for free in practical professions that could be the basis for future employment.\n\nPrince Jan Tadeusz Lubomirski (1826 – 1908) founded the Warsaw Charity Society. He was the long-standing president of the Ophthalmology Institute in Warsaw, which conducted ophthalmology research according to European standards. On his initiative, special teams were set up which helped poor people to get free eye care. During the January Uprising the prince was a member of the National Government of Romuald Traugutt, where he served as a head of the Department of Internal Affairs. For anti-Tsarist activities, he was exiled deep into Russia, to Nizhny Novgorod. He supported Polish education. He protected Polish vocational organizations from competition from Russian and Prussian ones and established credit unions. He tried to regain possession of Polish art stolen by the Russians; and among others, he helped to reconstruct the Poniatowski monument standing in front of the Presidential Palace. He also restored and renovated the Zygmunt's Column, and bought Polish castles in Czersk and Iłża, in order to save them from being demolished. In 1875, he established the Museum of Industry and Agriculture in Warsaw. He established evening schools for craftsmen and journeymen as well as penny-saving banks for the poor. He financed the publishing of sources important in the history of Poland, as well as professional magazines. He organized free libraries.\n\nWładysław Emanuel Lubomirski supported the Zoological Cabinet of the University of Warsaw, helping to purchase teaching aids and financing travel by employees of the university. He donated his collection of shells. He was interested in floristics and studied the behavior of plants in the changed climate conditions. The Zoological Museum of the Institute of Zoology of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) has been making use of his collections to this day.\n\nPrince Władysław Lubomirski (1866 – 1934) was a patron and founder of Music Young Poland. To facilitate the operation of the organization, he founded a company that promoted talented young Polish artists. He supported music education. He helped to promote Karol Szymanowski, Artur Rubinstein, and Grzegorz Fitelberg. He helped to protect the Warsaw Philharmonic from closure by Tsarist officials. Władysław and Jan Tadeusz Lubomirski were important in creating the Family Association of the Princes Lubomirski.\n\nPrince Stanisław Sebastian Lubomirski (1875 – 1932) founded the Warsaw aviation association Aviata in 1910. His aim was to establish the first civilian pilot school and aircraft factory on Polish soil. The first airport of Aviata was located at Mokotów Field, with the permission of Tsarist officials.\n\nOn 7 of October 1918, after 123 years under the third partition, on the initiative of Prince Regent Zdzisław Lubomirski (1865 – 1943), Polish independence was proclaimed and published in the Monitor Polski. Zdzisław was a politician, president of the Civic Committee, and the president of Warsaw. He extended self-government, organized intervention works, credit unions, and cared for the education and living conditions of the Varsovians. His activities mapped out the direction that future politicians of the independent state would follow. In 1926, he undertook the role of mediator between the parties to the May coup. In the 1930s, he was a senator on the foreign affairs and military committees. During World War II he was imprisoned and tortured by the Gestapo. He died of wounds sustained in prison.\n\nIn the years 1919 – 1939, princes Lubomirski served as Members of Parliament, senators, and in the ministries. They were also engaged in the industrialization of the country. They belonged to the key organizations involved in the modernization of roads, railways, and aviation. They took part in the reconstruction of the Polish army. They formed banking centres and credit unions, which provided cheap loans to the poorest, and were active in educational organizations, financing schools, as well as being engaged in Polish culture.\n\nPrince Stefan Lubomirski (1862 – 1941) was a founder of the Polish Olympic Games Committee (later the Polish Olympic committee, PKOL), becoming its first president (its next president being his cousin, Prince Kazimierz Lubomirski), and a member of the International Olympic Committee. Prince Stefan was passionate about racehorse breeding, forming with his brothers the most modern horse-breeding farm in Poland at Widzów manor near Częstochowa. Stefan was the owner of the Warsaw Commuter Railways (Warszawska Kolej Dojazdowa) company, which created the narrow gauge passenger and freight railways of Grójec, Jabłonków, and Wilanów. Railways allowed capital city dwellers to reach factories located outside the city and residents of suburban areas to get to the capital city. During World War II, the railways built by Lubomirski delivered supplies to the occupied city and brought employees to Warsaw offices and factories.\n\nPrince Stanisław Sebastian Lubomirski established the central union of Polish industry Leviatan, where he was the president from 1932. The union promoted the ideas of development of industry – lowering taxes, social security benefits for workers, and increasing state aid to industry. Members of the organization were elected to the Sejm, the Senate, were members of governments of the Second Republic of Poland, and served other state institutions. They published three magazines: \"Economic Review\" (\"Przegląd Gospodarczy\"), \"The Polish Courier\" (\"Kurier Polski\"), and \"The Telegram\" (\"Depesza\"). Stanisław Sebastian established the Industrial Bank of Warsaw SA (Bank Przemysłowy Warszawski S.A.) and was the president of the Commercial Bank (Bank Handlowy) in Warsaw, the Central Union of Polish Industry (Centralny Związek Przemysłu Polskiego), the Polish Bank Association (Związek Banków Polskich), and the Association of Polish Industrialists (Stowarzyszenie Przemysłowców Polskich). He devoted his life to the struggle for the independence of the Polish economy from the influence of the partitioners, and, after regaining independence, from that of neighbouring countries.\n\nPrince Stefan Lubomirski (1898 – 1948) during the occupation was a member of the Western Union. For keeping a secret storehouse of medicines for the Home Army, he was arrested and detained in prison in Montelupich. He was on the list to be shot but escaped to Kraków, where he was hidden. The Germans set the date for the transportation of his family to the concentration camp near Oświęcim.\n\nPrince Eugeniusz Lubomirski (1895 – 1982) was arrested by the NKVD and put in the Lubyanka Prison, where he met General Anders, later becoming the general's adjutant, fighting at the general's side throughout Europe. He eventually reached the United Kingdom and was a candidate for President of Poland in Exile.\n\nPrince Hieronim Lubomirski was killed at the age of 17, during the rescue of prisoners in Pawiak code-named \"Action \"Pawiak\"\" (\"Akcja Pawiak\"). On July 19–20, 1944, a Ukrainian Wachmeister (guard) Petrenko, and some prisoners attempted a mass jailbreak, supported by an attack from the outside, but failed. Petrenko and several others committed suicide. The Resistance attack detachment was ambushed and suffered very heavy casualties, practically ceasing to exist. In reprisal, over 380 prisoners were executed the next day.\n\nPrince Jerzy Ignacy Lubomirski (1882 – 1945) was active in the local community. He travelled to Vienna to discuss the construction of the bridge over the San River. He helped people particularly affected during the war. He was arrested in 1944 and detained and tortured in Tarnobrzeg prison. He was murdered by the Secret Police (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa) as a member of the Home Army.\n\nIn 2010, family members established the Princes Lubomirski Foundation (\"Fundacja Książąt Lubomirskich\"), to facilitate charitable activities. The foundation supports the development of various social and heritage projects in Poland. Jan Lubomirski-Lanckoroński is the current president of the foundation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1839529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839529", "title": "Regression dilution", "text": "Regression dilution\n\nRegression dilution, also known as regression attenuation, is the biasing of the regression slope towards zero (the underestimation of its absolute value), caused by errors in the independent variable.\n\nConsider fitting a straight line for the relationship of an outcome variable \"y\" to a predictor variable \"x\", and estimating the slope of the line. Statistical variability, measurement error or random noise in the \"y\" variable causes uncertainty in the estimated slope, but not bias: on average, the procedure calculates the right slope. However, variability, measurement error or random noise in the \"x\" variable causes bias in the estimated slope (as well as imprecision). The greater the variance in the \"x\" measurement, the closer the estimated slope must approach zero instead of the true value.\n\nIt may seem counter-intuitive that noise in the predictor variable \"x\" induces a bias, but noise in the outcome variable \"y\" does not. Recall that linear regression is not symmetric: the line of best fit for predicting \"y\" from \"x\" (the usual linear regression) is not the same as the line of best fit for predicting \"x\" from \"y\".\n\nThe case that the \"x\" variable arises randomly is known as the structural model or structural relationship. For example, in a medical study patients are recruited as a sample from a population, and their characteristics such as blood pressure may be viewed as arising from a random sample.\n\nUnder certain assumptions (typically, normal distribution assumptions) there is a known ratio between the true slope, and the expected estimated slope. Frost and Thompson (2000) review several methods for estimating this ratio and hence correcting the estimated slope. The term \"regression dilution ratio\", although not defined in quite the same way by all authors, is used for this general approach, in which the usual linear regression is fitted, and then a correction applied. The reply to Frost & Thompson by Longford (2001) refers the reader to other methods, expanding the regression model to acknowledge the variability in the x variable, so that no bias arises. Fuller (1987) is one of the standard references for assessing and correcting for regression dilution.\n\nHughes (1993) shows that the regression dilution ratio methods apply approximately in survival models. Rosner (1992) shows that the ratio methods apply approximately to logistic regression models. Carroll et al. (1995) give more detail on regression dilution in nonlinear models, presenting the regression dilution ratio methods as the simplest case of \"regression calibration\" methods, in which additional covariates may also be incorporated.\n\nIn general, methods for the structural model require some estimate of the variability of the x variable. This will require repeated measurements of the x variable in the same individuals, either in a sub-study of the main data set, or in a separate data set. Without this information it will not be possible to make a correction.\n\nThe case that \"x\" is fixed, but measured with noise, is known as the functional model or functional relationship. See, for example, Riggs et al. (1978).\n\nThe case of multiple predictor variables subject to variability (possibly correlated) has been well-studied for linear regression, and for some non-linear regression models. Other non-linear models, such as proportional hazards models for survival analysis, have been considered only with a single predictor subject to variability.\n\nIn statistical inference based on regression coefficients, yes; in predictive modelling applications, correction is neither necessary nor appropriate. To understand this, consider the measurement error as follows. Let \"y\" be the outcome variable, \"x\" be the true predictor variable, and \"w\" be an approximate observation of \"x\". Frost and Thompson suggest, for example, that \"x\" may be the true, long-term blood pressure of a patient, and \"w\" may be the blood pressure observed on one particular clinic visit. Regression dilution arises if we are interested in the relationship between \"y\" and \"x\", but estimate the relationship between \"y\" and \"w\". Because \"w\" is measured with variability, the slope of a regression line of \"y\" on \"w\" is less than the regression line of \"y\" on \"x\".\n\nDoes this matter? In predictive modelling, no. Standard methods can fit a regression of y on w without bias. There is bias only if we then use the regression of y on w as an approximation to the regression of y on x. In the example, assuming that blood pressure measurements are similarly variable in future patients, our regression line of y on w (observed blood pressure) gives unbiased predictions.\n\nAn example of a circumstance in which correction is desired is prediction of change. Suppose the change in \"x\" is known under some new circumstance: to estimate the likely change in an outcome variable \"y\", the slope of the regression of \"y\" on \"x\" is needed, not \"y\" on \"w\". This arises in epidemiology. To continue the example in which \"x\" denotes blood pressure, perhaps a large clinical trial has provided an estimate of the change in blood pressure under a new treatment; then the possible effect on \"y\", under the new treatment, should be estimated from the slope in the regression of \"y\" on \"x\".\n\nAnother circumstance is predictive modelling in which future observations are also variable, but not (in the phrase used above) \"similarly variable\". For example, if the current data set includes blood pressure measured with greater precision than is common in clinical practice. One specific example of this arose when developing a regression equation based on a clinical trial, in which blood pressure was the average of six measurements, for use in clinical practice, where blood pressure is usually a single measurement.\n\nAll of these results can be shown mathematically, in the case of simple linear regression assuming normal distributions throughout (the framework of Frost & Thompson). \n\nIt has been discussed that a poorly executed correction for regression dilution, in particular when performed without checking for the underlying assumptions, may do more damage to an estimate than no correction.\n\nRegression dilution was first mentioned, under the name attenuation, by Spearman (1904). Those seeking a readable mathematical treatment might like to start with Frost and Thompson (2000), or see correction for attenuation.\n\n"}

The decade saw the beginning of European settlement, marked by the introduction of crops from Europe and the New World and culminating in war with the Khoikhoi in 1659.\n\nBernert Willemsz Wijlant, the first European baby, was born at the Cape on 6 June 1652. In 1654, Batavian convicts and political opponents were banished to the Cape bringing Islam to South Africa. Hout Bay, a sheltered cove just south of the Cape settlement is proposed as a settlement for Dutch families on the 6 October 1654. Van Riebeeck sent Jan Wintervogel, a Dutch ensign, to scout the interior in 1655. Wintervogel went as far as Saldanha Bay. Van Riebeeck sent Willem Muller, a Dutch corporal, with the Khoikhoi interpreter, Autsumao, to explore the Hottentots Holland region. Maize and Grape vines were planted in the Cape that same year. In 1657, Abraham Gabbema was sent to scout the interior and explored as far as the Berg River and Paarl regions. Doman, the leader of the Goringhaiqua Khoikhoi, was sent to Batavia to be trained as an interpreter. Nine Dutch East India Company servants were freed to become free burghers \"(free citizens)\" on 21 February. They settled along the Liesbeeck River (now Rondebosch area). The first wine was pressed from Cape grapes on 2 February 1659. Jan van Riebeeck established the Burgher Militia on 1 May 1659. A few days later on 19 May, the Khoikhoi protested against white encroachment, leading to the first Khoikhoi-Dutch War.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company gave van Riebeeck authority to bring slaves to South Africa in 1654. The \"Roode Vos\" ship sailed to Mauritius and Anongil Bay, Madagascar in search of slaves, but brought back none. In 1658, the \"Amersfoort\" ship stole 250 slaves from a Portuguese slave trading trafficking slaves from Angola to Brazil. The ship arrived in South Africa on 28 March with 170 slaves. 80 died during the trip. Later that year, the \"Hassalt\" ship brought 228 out of an initial 271 slaves from the Gulf of Guinea to South Africa on 6 May. 43 died at sea. After these two shipments, the Dutch East and West companies agreed to stop enslaving natives from lands controlled by the other company. Slave traffickers brought 63,000 slaves to South Africa between 1658 and 1808, when the British abolished the slave trade.\n\nCatharina Anthonis, became the first slave to be freed to marry Jan Woutersz, a Dutch settler, in 1656. In 1658 a Portuguese slaver was captured and 174 slaves were taken. About 80 were shipped to Batavia.\n\n"}

{"id": "1839542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839542", "title": "Wheelbuilding", "text": "Wheelbuilding\n\nWheelbuilding is the process of assembling wire wheels (generally a bicycle wheel, but including wheelchairs, and some cars). The components of a wire wheel are the rim, spokes, nipples, and hub.\n\nThe wheelwright must ensure that the wheel is true in two ways: lateral (sideways wobble) and radial (roundness/hop). The wheel also needs to be properly dished if applicable (the left and right sides of the rear wheel differ, the drive-side spokes requiring higher tension). Spokes should have no residual twist (windup) from tightening the nipples. The spokes may be \"stress relieved\", i.e. subjected to a greater tension during building than they are ever likely to encounter in use - usually by squeezing pairs of spokes together very hard. This 'yields' the spokes (and/or the hub) into a permanent shape where they bend around the hub flanges and each other.\n\nSpoking patterns may be radial or semi-tangential. For a normal wheel size and spoke count, only the latter is suitable for a wheel that has to transmit torque from the hub to the rim, as with rear wheels or hub brakes. This rule is occasionally broken where a very large number of spokes is used or the wheel is unusually small in diameter, either of which reduces the amount of increased tensile stress on each radial spoke to an acceptable degree; some BMX bicycles and low-riders use radial spoking for both wheels. Rear wheels may also incorporate radial spoking on the non-drive side and semi-tangential spoking on the drive side. At least one example, the Mavic Ksyrium, has radial spoking on the drive side of the rear wheel.\n\nThe most common spoking pattern is \"three-cross\" where each spoke crosses three others on the same flange of the hub before meeting the rim. The last cross is normally \"interlaced\" by wrapping the spoke around the one from the other side of the flange. Radial-spoked wheels, where the spokes do not cross each other, saves roughly the weight of two spokes (because the spokes are shorter) compared to a three-cross wheel but run an increased risk of cracking at the hub flange, unless the hub is specifically designed for this pattern. Two-cross is sometimes used for hubs with large-diameter flanges (such as generator/dynamo hubs or large flange hubs), as it gives a more perpendicular spoke/rim angle, and four-cross is standard for spoke counts of 40 and above.\n\nMost conventional bicycle wheels now use 32 or 36 spokes front and rear, although the asymmetry of the rear wheel (to allow for the cluster of sprockets), and the additional weight it carries, means it benefits from having more spokes than the front. Commonly used models vary from 18 spokes for racing bikes to 36 for cross-country touring bikes to 48 spokes on tandems and heavily abused BMX bikes. The minimum number of spokes allowed for competition is 12. Some lowrider bicycles use as many as 144 brightly chromed spokes per wheel, although these are not meant for serious riding. \n\nWheels can be built by machine instead of by hand. However, machine-built wheels are rarely as satisfactory as handbuilt wheels, partly because it is uneconomical to allow the machine to spend long enough on each wheel for a perfect result but also because most machines leave spokes with some residual twist. Machine-built wheels can be identified by their lacing pattern (if it is not radial), as the spokes are laced the same on each side, rather than mirrored as on hand-built wheels. More modern \"factory built\" wheels such as Mavic's Ksyrium series are of quite different construction from that of a conventional wheel, trading a deeper and stronger rim for fewer spokes. They are popular, and quite light (in the more expensive models) but not as durable, readily repairable or maintainable as a conventional wheel.\n\nStainless steel is the most common material for spokes, although most mass-produced budget wheels use galvanized steel spokes. Other materials such as titanium or aluminum are often used to reduce weight. Some wheels are designed around carbon fiber spokes, which are often completely integrated with the hub and rim and bladed in shape. Non-steel spokes are normally reserved for racing bikes and other specialist applications where weight, aerodynamics and performance are valued over durability and cost.\n\nRims were traditionally made of steel but currently aluminum is by far most common and best choice due to its light weight, high durability and stiffness. Wood is also used. Composite materials such as carbon fiber are sometimes used, typically for racing competitions such as time trial, triathlon and track cycling, although carbon fiber is becoming more common for recreational uses such as road cycling or mountain biking due to its looks, strength and feel.\n\nMotorcycle wire wheels typically use 36 or 40 spokes, of much heavier gauge than those on a bicycle. They are never \"interlaced\" in the manner described above, nor are \"radial\" builds recommended (only wheels without brakes). Motorcycle rims are dimpled toward the hub at each spoke location, and the holes for the spokes are drilled into the dimples at an angle. This angle is a function of the cross-pattern used to lace the wheel, the diameter of the hub flanges, and the width of the hub at the flanges. Conical-hub wheels have a different angle drilled into one side of the rim when compared with the other side. Adequate spoke tension is very important with motorcycle wheels, because of the greater torque applied to the wheel by an engine or disc brake. Loose spokes on a wheel fatigue rapidly and break, usually at the bend where they attach to the hub. When this happens, the wheel must be rebuilt using all new spokes, because even unbroken spokes in such a wheel are fatigued, and will usually break when tightened during the truing operation.\n\nThe correct length of spokes required can be calculated using rim diameter, hub flange diameter, hub width, lacing pattern, and number of spokes. See and. These calculations can be done either by hand (the old-fashioned way - with a pen, paper and calculator) or by using a computer. There are many programs available and they range in complexity from simple Excel spreadsheets to stand alone desktop applications and web based calculators. An alternative method is to refer to a table which has the spoke lengths for a number of common hub and rim combinations.\n\nA good wheelbuilder will ensure that the valve hole lies between two nearly parallel spokes to ease attachment of a pump head. This does not affect the structural integrity of the wheel, and this rule is usually observed. \n\nIt is also a convention, if the hub has a maker's label on its barrel, for the label to face (and be readable through) the valve hole. See Gerd Schraner for methodology. The rim labels should be readable from the right-hand side (drive side) of the bicycle. The hub labels should face in the same direction front and rear (generally so they are readable from the seat), this means that even an undished, symmetrical front wheel has to be laced to the rim the \"proper\" way round, if perfection is the aim.\n"}
{"id": "1839545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839545", "title": "Virtual Theatre", "text": "Virtual Theatre\n\nThe Virtual Theatre is a computer game engine designed by Revolution Software to produce adventure games for computer platforms. The engine allowed their team to script events, and move animated sprites against a drawn background with moving elements using a point-and-click style interface. Upon its first release, it rivaled competing engines like LucasArts' SCUMM and Sierra's Creative Interpreter, due to its then high level of artificial intelligence. The engine was first proposed in 1989, while the first game to use it, \"Lure of the Temptress\", was released in 1992, followed by \"Beneath a Steel Sky\" (1994), \"\" (1996) and \"\" (1997).\n\nIt allowed in-game characters to wander around the gameworld independently of each other, performing \"everyday life\" actions, which was not previously possible, and all characters and objects occupied space; consequently, non-player characters had to side-step the player's protagonist and any other object they came across, as well as the player having to side-step them, achieving a more realistic game world that previous engines were unable to provide, though non-player characters could unwittingly block a path as the player was traversing the game scene. Non-player characters performed much simpler tasks with each release due to size constraints.\n\nTwo games (\"Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars\" and \"Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror\") that use a Virtual Theatre variant engine can now be played on modern hardware using ScummVM, which as a result allows the engine to run on platforms where the titles were not officially released. In 2012, it was confirmed that the engine would be revived as \"Virtual Theatre 7\" for the fifth \"Broken Sword\" titled \"\" (2013).\n\nCharles Cecil and Tony Warriner had worked together at Artic Computing, an English video game development company. In 1990 they decided to set up their own video-game development company, together with David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. For their debut adventure game, \"Lure of the Temptress\", released in 1992 for Amiga, Atari ST and PC, Cecil, Warriner, Sykes and Dan Marchant created the concept of the game engine titled \"Virtual Theatre\", which Warriner wrote.\n\nFor \"Beneath a Steel Sky\", released in 1994 for Amiga, and PC, Revolution used an updated version of Virtual Theatre, Virtual Theatre 2.0, written by Warriner and Sykes. However, because the game was six times the size of \"Lure of the Temptress\", non-player characters had to perform much simpler tasks than in its predecessor. \"Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars\", released in 1996 for PC, Mac and PlayStation, and its sequel, \"\", released in 1997 for PC and PlayStation, also used modified versions of the Virtual Theatre engine. The engine subsequently underwent various updates. For \"\" a brand-new engine (\"VT7\") was developed in order to deal with multiple platforms and, in particular, with screen resolution (the system is built on C++ and OpenGL, and a custom scripting-language to implement the game itself).\n\nTraditionally in adventure game engines, non-player characters were static awaiting the player to interact with them to trigger an event. However, Virtual Theatre allowed non-player characters to traverse the world in seemingly random patterns, interacting with their environment. Upon the engine's first release, it rivaled competing engines such as LucasArts' SCUMM engine, and Sierra's Creative Interpreter, due to its then high level of artificial intelligence.\n\nAnother advantage of the engine is that it is a cross-platform engine. It was also faster on the Amiga than the C code that was used by many USA programmers at that time. Compared to the Sierra titles, the engine became in this respect more sophisticated, a reason why Revolution did the conversion of \"\" to the Amiga.\n\nAll of the in-game objects (including non-player characters) in Virtual Theatre occupied space, which was a unique feature for an engine at the time. Consequently, non-player characters had to side-step the player's protagonist and any other object they came across, as well as the player had to side step them. When a non-player character bypassed the protagonist, he or she uttered a comment (like \"Excuse me, Sir\"). As the result, the engine achieved a more realistic game world than previous engines were able to provide, though non-player characters could unwittingly block a path as the player was traversing the game scene. \nThis was remedied with the release of \"Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars\", where the protagonist, if found his way blocked by another character, could simply walk through them.\n\nTwo games (\"Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars\" and \"Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror\") that use a Virtual Theatre variant engine can now be played on modern hardware using ScummVM.\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town was previously a barangay called Maligaya, the largest barangay during the administration of President Diosdado Macapagal. Local politicians, led by former guerrilla chief Nicolas Jamilla, Sr., battled for the conversion of Maligaya into a new town. They renamed it after the ten-year-old daughter of the President, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who later on herself became the fourteenth President in 2001. Jamilla became the first mayor of the town, which kept the old name \"Maligaya\" as the name of a barangay in the poblacion.\n\nGloria is located from the provincial capital Calapan City.\n\nIt is one of the 7 towns comprising Oriental Mindoro's second district. On its north lies its mother town Pinamalayan, on the west is the town of Sablayan in Occidental Mindoro. On the south is the town of Bansud, while on the east is the Tablas Strait.\n\nGloria is divided into 27 barangays: nine (9) barangays are situated along the national highway - Bulaklakan, Maligaya, Kawit, Narra, Balete, Lucio Laurel, G. Antonino, Santa Maria and Banus; six (6) are coastal barangays - Tambong, San Antonio, Santa Theresa, Guimbonan, Maragooc and Agsalin; and twelve (12) interior barangays on the west side - Agos, A. Bonifacio, Alma Villa, Mirayan, Buong Lupa, Malamig, Malubay, M. Adriatico, Papandungin, Malayong, Banutan and Manguyang.\n\nGloria was once part of the municipality of Pinamalayan. In 1915, migrant families from Marinduque settled in Barrio Tambong, and in 1930, when a national road was built through Pinamalayan, they moved west and occupied the area along this road. Tambong was later divided into two barrios: the first retained the original name, while the second was called Maligaya (meaning \"happy\"), alluding to the settlers' happiness at the bountiful yield of their agricultural crops.\n\nThe residents of 25 barrios (Maligaya, Kawit, Malusak, Balite, Dalagan, Tinalunan, Calamundingan, Bulbogan, Langang, Banus, Agus, Batingan, Papandungin, Malamig, Tubag, Malayong, Malubay, Mirayan, Guimbonan, Agsalin, Manguyang, Banutan, Boong-Lupa, Tambong and Maragooc) grouped together and petitioned for the separation of their barrios from the municipality of Pinamalayan. The petition was granted on October 1, 1964, through Executive Order No. 117 issued by President Diosdado Macapagal. Executive Order No. 140, issued on February 25, 1965, by the same President, defined and fixed the boundaries of Gloria as a new municipality. On December 24, 1965, however, the Supreme Court nullified its status as a municipality. Gloria was finally recognized as a distinct municipality on June 9, 1966, when Housebill No. 6107, sponsored by Congressman Luciano Joson, was enacted into law. (It later became known as RA 4651.)\n\nThe new municipality was named Gloria, primarily as a token of gratitude to President Macapagal, whose daughter is named Gloria, and secondarily from the word \"glory\", celebrating the settlers' \"glorious\" life in Barrio Maligaya.\n\nBarrio Maligaya later became the poblacion and the official seat of the municipal government. Nicolas M. Jamilla Sr. was appointed first Mayor of Gloria by President Diosdado Macapagal, serving from 1964 to 1967. He then ran in the local election of 1967 and won. The first session of the Municipal Council was held in the residence of Mr. Albino Janda. The town's official functions were held in this house from February 1964 to November 1965; then in the residences of Genaro Olavidez from March to June 1965 and Arsenio Arriola from July 1965 to 1973.\n\nThe name of the following barangays were changed: Bulbugan to Santa Maria; Dalagan to San Antonio; Malusak to Narra; Batingan to A. Bonifacio; Tubag to Macario Adriatico; Tinalunan to Gaudencio Antonino; Langang to Santa Theresa and Calamundingan to Lucio Laurel. The new barangays of Bulaklakan and Alma Villa were created later. In 1968, Gloria Realty Development Corporation donated two hectares to the municipality, and this became the site of the Municipal Building in 1972. Under the leadership of Mayor Jamilla, the municipality later bought a ten-hectare lot, which became the site of the Municipal Cemetery, Sports Center, Agricultural Center and Breeding Station, and the Medicare Hospital.\n\nCurrent Municipal Officials:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was formerly a director of UCB, Sita (a worldwide waste management company located in France) and Ondeo Nalco (a water management company in the United States).\n\nOn 22 September 1984 in Brussels, Lorenz married Princess Astrid of Belgium, the only daughter of the then-Prince and Princess of Liège, former King Albert II and Queen Paola. The couple have five children and two grandchildren:\n\nPrince Lorenz is a godfather to Prince Carl-Johan of Nassau, youngest child of Prince Jean of Luxembourg and Count Costantino Secco di Aragona, oldest son of his cousin Archduchess Catharina-Maria of Austria.\n\nSince 2004, Lorenz has been the honorary president of the Council of the \"Koninklijke Vereniging der Historische Woonsteden van België/Association Royale des Demeures Historiques de Belgique\". Since 2005, he has been the Patron of \"Europae Thesauri\", an association of European cathedral and church treasuries.\n\nLorenz has also served as deputy chairman of the Société des Amis of the Almanach de Gotha.\n\nHe is named member of the Royal Crown Council of Romania in 2015.\n\n\nThe title \"Prince of Belgium\" was granted to him by Royal Decree of 10 November 1995 by his father-in-law, King Albert II of Belgium. Depending on the situation, Lorenz is thus legally and formally styled HRH Prince Lorenz of Belgium, or internationally otherwise HI&RH Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este or simply HI&RH The Archduke of Austria-Este. His children by Princess Astrid bear the titles \"Prince(ss) of Belgium\", by Belgian decree of 2 December 1991, in addition to their traditional Austrian titles, \"Archduke/Archduchess of Austria, Prince(ss) Royal of Hungary\". Some Austrian monarchists consider Lorenz legitimate \"Thronfolger\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bots are used in a variety of video game genres for a variety of tasks: a bot written for a first-person shooter (FPS) works very differently from one written for a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). The former may include analysis of the map and even basic strategy; the latter may be used to automate a repetitive and tedious task like farming.\n\nBots written for first-person shooters usually try to mimic how a human would play a game. Computer-controlled bots may play against other bots and/or human players in unison, either over the Internet, on a LAN or in a local session. Features and intelligence of bots may vary greatly, especially with community created content. Advanced bots feature machine learning for dynamic learning of patterns of the opponent as well as dynamic learning of previously unknown maps – whereas more trivial bots may rely completely on lists of waypoints created for each map by the developer, limiting the bot to play only maps with said waypoints.\n\nUsing bots is generally against the rules of current massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), but a significant number of players still use MMORPG bots for games like RuneScape.\n\nMUD players may run bots to automate laborious tasks, which can sometimes make up the bulk of the gameplay. While a prohibited practice in most MUDs, there is an incentive for the player to save time while the bot accumulates resources, such as experience, for the player character.\n\nBots may be static, dynamic, or both. Static bots are designed to follow pre-made waypoints for each level or map. These bots need a unique waypoint file for each map. For example, \"Quake III Arena\" bots use an area awareness system file to move around the map, while \"Counter-Strike\" bots use a waypoint file. Dynamic bots learn the levels and maps as they play, such as RealBot for \"Counter-Strike\". Some bots are designed using both static and dynamic features.\n\n"}
{"id": "1839590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839590", "title": "David Cain (comics)", "text": "David Cain (comics)\n\nDavid Cain is a fictional character in the . He first appeared in \"Batman\" #567 (July 1999), and was created by Kelley Puckett and Damion Scott.\n\nDavid Cain is one of the world's premier assassins, whose victims have included some of the most famous and powerful people on the planet. He trained the young Bruce Wayne with some of the skills that he would use as Batman, although Bruce has never used some of the more lethal techniques Cain taught him and has since surpassed his teacher in ability. Regarding his decision to train with an assassin, Batman explained, \"Knowing \"how\" to kill doesn't mean you \"must\" kill\".\n\nCain desired a perfect partner with whom to carry out his assassination plans. Attempts to train young children resulted in failure, so he decided to conceive one himself. He found the perfect mother in a martial artist named Sandra Wu-San. He watched her duel her sister at a tournament and concluded that it was her sister Carolyn that was holding Sandra back from her full potential. He murdered Carolyn and ambushed Sandra with the help of Ra's al Ghul and his League of Assassins. In exchange for sparing her life, Sandra agreed to bear David's child and leave the child in his care for him to train.\n\nThe child, Cassandra, would be Cain's \"One Who Is All,\" whose native tongue was one-on-one combat. This gave her the ability to read people's intentions simply by their body language. The latter was a special gift that only the Wu-San sisters and Cassandra knew. After bearing his child, Sandra set out to become Lady Shiva.\n\nCain trained Cassandra in every imaginable form of violence, from hand-to-hand combat to weapons and explosives. Cain never taught her to read or write, and even avoided speaking in her presence; her only language was her ability to read people and predict what her opponents were going to do. His training methods were tantamount to child abuse. When she was 8 years old, Cain took her to kill a businessman. After she did, she \"read\" him as he died, she saw death as the man saw it. \"Terror and then... nothing\". It was this reading that made her decide that murder was wrong and she ran away from Cain, Cain musing in hindsight that he simply pushed her too far too young.\n\nCain was first introduced into the Batman universe in the \"No Man's Land\" (1999) comic book arc. Two-Face hires him to assassinate James Gordon. Cassandra spots him and saves Gordon's life. After she has burned Two-Face's money to void the contract and refuses to come back to him, Cain leaves Gotham, briefly tearful at hearing his daughter's first word (\"Stop\"). In Cassandra's Batgirl book, Cain is shown to be depressed and alcoholic, constantly rewatching old tapes of Cassandra's training. He later broadcasts a video into the Batcave that reveals what Cassandra had done years ago, but Batman continues to trust her when she deliberately charges towards an armed opponent to save an innocent man, explaining that her reason for doing so was instinct.\n\nLex Luthor hired Cain to frame Bruce Wayne for the murder of Vesper Fairchild, however Cain had an ulterior motive; determining whether or not Batman was worthy enough of raising Cassandra. Having realised that Bruce was Batman, Cain not only framed Bruce Wayne for Vesper's murder, but planted a complex sequence of evidence to suggest that Wayne killed her because she had deduced Batman's true identity, infiltrating the Batcave and doctoring and then erasing Vesper's electronic journal in such a manner that only the Bat-family could determine what he had done. Although Batman briefly flees with the intention of abandoning his life as Bruce Wayne, a series of events force him to recognise the importance of his civilian life, while Cassandra determines that Cain was responsible after examination of Vesper's corpse reveals that she was first immobilised with a nerve strike Cain taught her and Bruce. Luring Cain into a confrontation near the end of the story arc, Cain concludes that Batman is indeed worthy and turns himself in to clear Wayne's name.\n\nLuthor hires Deadshot to kill Cain while he is in jail due to a fear of him implicating Luthor in Fairchild's murder. Cain has a death wish and almost allows himself to be killed before being reminded of Cassandra. He then fights back and shoots Deadshot repeatedly, intentionally leaving him alive to prove a point. Cassandra visits Cain while in jail and attacks him, threatening to kill him if he ever commits another murder. Cain was proud of this and told Cassandra the date of her birthday and said that \"My little girl... all grown up.\" Later, he escaped from prison undetected to give Cassandra a birthday present before returning.\n\nCassandra recently became curious as to the identity of her birth mother, believing it to be Lady Shiva. When she visited Cain in prison, he refused to tell her. Cassandra eventually confirmed her suspicions when she met Lady Shiva herself. As a result, Cassandra also quit being the super heroine Batgirl.\n\nFollowing the \"One Year Later\" continuity jump, Robin captures Cain and brings him to the League of Assassins as ransom to save Cassandra, only to find that Cassandra is their leader. Cassandra explains that she chose to join the League because she found that Cain had trained other children in addition to her. Her actions were later explained to be the result of Deathstroke injecting her with a mind-altering serum. After her speech, Cassandra handed Robin a gun to kill David, offering him a place in her League. When he refused, she shot her father herself. Cain tells Robin that there were other girls in addition to Cassandra and Annalea before apparently dying. Afterwards, Robin and Cassandra fight. The battle ends when an explosion causes a fire to break out. By the time Robin returns to where he had left Cain's body, it is gone and the assassins' necks are broken.\n\nIn the 2008 Batgirl mini-series, it is revealed that Deathstroke had given Cassandra the gun she used to shoot Cain, which was not fatal. After Tim and Cassandra started fighting, Deathstroke got up and killed the ninjas himself. He hoped to open up an \"assassination shop\" with Cassandra as his second-in-command, using a drug that would turn his army into metahumans. He disappears when Cassandra murders the businessman who was providing that drug. Cain then plots with Slade to \"cripple the meta-hero community\". Cassandra, who used listening devices to overhear, believes that Oracle is the target of this plot and races to Platinum Heights, Oracle's base of operations, to rescue her. Cassandra locates her father on a rooftop and engages in one-on-one combat. He slides over an edge and is hanging by one hand. Cassandra contemplates whether to save him or not; when he falls, she attempts to grab him. She sees that he only fell a few feet to a ledge below, where he is arrested by Batman, who had followed Cassandra there.\n\nDavid Cain appeared in The New 52 as an assassin working for the villain named \"Mother\" in \"Batman and Robin Eternal\". In this continuity, David is known by the assassin name \"Orphan\" and raises his daughter Cassandra in a very similar way as portrayed in the Pre-Flashpoint continuity. He brings Cassandra up in an extremely isolated environment. She was trained in all manner of hand-to-hand combat and effectively reading body-language, making her able to predict and anticipate her opponent's attacks. Much like before The New 52, he refrained from showing her any love or affection as a father, not even teaching her how to speak in full sentences. He raised her this way at the behest of Mother, who believes that the perfect assassin could only be molded from exposure to a traumatic existence from a very young age. In DC Rebirth, it is revealed that David fathered the child with Lady Shiva, an assassin for the League of Shadows.\n\n"}

He defeated the incumbent Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1991 general election. Known for his charismatic style, Bhandari had propounded the popular communist principle or thought People's Multiparty Democracy (). He is widely regarded for peaking the Nepal's communist movement to a greater height. He died in a mysterious jeep accident in Dasdhunga, Chitwan, in 1993 of which the cause of death has not yet revealed. It has been dubbed as an unsolved murder.\n\nMadan Bhandari was born in the Dhungesangu village of Taplejung district in eastern Nepal. He studied in Medibung School in Taplejung and in Varanasi, India. In 1972, he became a central committee member of the Janabadi Sanskritik Morcha (Democratic Cultural Front), a student movement established by Pushpa Lal Shrestha. Around 1976 he left Pushpa Lal's Communist Party of Nepal to create the Mukti Morcha Samuha (\"Liberation Front Group\"), which formed an alliance with the survivors of the Jhapa Movement in 1978. He was a founding member of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) preceding the 1980 referendum and was elected General-Secretary at its Fourth National Congress in 1986.\n\nBhandari became the General-Secretary when CPN (ML) merged into the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) in 1991. He played a central role in the CPN (UML) program of \"People's Multiparty Democracy,\" which left his party as the strongest communist party in Nepal for several years even after his death.\n\nThe CPN (UML), under the leadership of Bhandari, won all but one seat in the Himalayan capital in the 1991 elections, the country's first free election after more than three decades. Bhandari proclaimed this \"a vote for democracy,\" \"a vote for independence\" and \"a vote for the alleviation of poverty.\" He argued for the popular vote as opposed to armed struggle as the main tactic for communists.\n\nBhandari was married to Bidhya Devi Bhandari in 1982. Ms. Bhandari at the time of her wedding to Bhandari was a junior political cadre of his party who later became the first female President of Nepal. The couple had two daughters, Usha Kiran Bhandari and Nisha Kusum Bhandari. Both daughters are married.\n\nOn May 16, 1993 Bhandari died in a car accident in Dasdhunga, Chitwan. According to an investigation led by K.P. Oli, it was not an accident but an unsolved murder. Of the three people inside the car, only the driver Amar Lama survived; the two leaders Madan Bhandari and Jibaraj Ashrit died.\n\nHis body was recovered three days later and kept in Dasharath Rangashala, where people visited throughout the day and into the night to pay their respects. The only survivor of that crash, driver Amar Lama, was murdered 10 years later. A group of unidentified gunmen abducted Lama from the office of Tajakhabar Weekly tabloid around 13:45. He was taken to the hamlet of Kirtipur on the southwestern outskirts of the capital and shot. The assassins then fled towards Panga village.\n\nA bust has been built at the spot of the accident at Dasdhunga. The government of Nepal proposed to build Madan Bhandari Highway from Shantinagar of Jhapa district to Rupal of Dadheldhura district. On March 2018, Madan Bhandari Museum was inaugurated in Urlabari, Morang. The damaged jeep of the 1993 accident has been kept on display at the Urlabari Museum.\n\nOn 2016, he was posthumously awarded with Nepal Ratna Man Padavi, the highest honour to a Nepali citizen by the Government of Nepal.\n\n"}

{"id": "1839664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839664", "title": "Whitchurch, Hampshire", "text": "Whitchurch, Hampshire\n\nWhitchurch is a town in Hampshire, England. It is on the River Test, south of Newbury, Berkshire, north of Winchester, east of Andover and west of Basingstoke. Much of the town is a Conservation Area. Because of the amount of wildlife in and near the River Test, its course and banks are designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nThe West of England Main Line links the town's railway station to London, and two main roads bypass the town (the A34, a major north–south route, and the A303, a major east–west route\n\nThe name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means 'white church', although there is evidence of occupation from the Iron Age, archaeological excavations having uncovered Roman and Iron Age pottery, tools and skeletal remains. In October 1987, members of the Andover Metal Detecting Club discovered a hoard of Late Iron Age coins, the Whitchurch Hoard, comprising 34 Gallo-Belgic E gold staters, and 108 British B (or, Chute,) gold staters. The earliest written record of Whitchurch dates from 909 AD in a charter by which King Edward the Elder confirmed the manor of Whitchurch to the monks of Winchester as England recovered from the Viking onslaught of the previous fifty years. It next appears in the \"Domesday Book\" of 1086. This records the name as 'Witcerce', occupying in the 'Hundred of Evingar' and also records that Witcerce was 'owned' by the monks at Winchester. Another theory on the origin of the name is that it means \"Place of Proclamation\". In parts of the north of England we see it reflected in Whit Walks, with Roman Catholics and Protestants choosing different days over the Whit Period for their Whit Walks. Whitchurch is well placed, being at the crossroads for north–south, east–west travellers.\n\nBy 1241, it was known as Witcherche and was becoming prosperous, holding a market on Mondays in the market place. This was a vital feature of medieval society, and produce such as butter, eggs, fruit and livestock were brought in for sale from the outlying farms and villages.\n\nWitcherche received a royal charter in 1285, having become a borough in 1284. The land ownership had by now passed to a form of tenure known as a burgage. As a borough, it was governed by a Court Leet. Meetings were held in the village hall each year, in October, to elect a mayor and burgesses. Witcherche's prosperity was again on the rise due to its widespread sheep farming, the wool being a valuable commodity at the time.\n\nThe River Test provided the power for at least four watermills, located every half-mile along the river through the town. The Town Mill was the source of power for milling corn, and other mills were used for finishing wool, weaving silk and dressing cloth. Only Whitchurch Silk Mill survives, the others having been converted into residential dwellings. The Silk Mill is a popular visitor attraction where silk is still produced after a very small interruption in 2012.\n\nWhen Henry VIII died in 1547 his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, inherited the throne. Under Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Edward Seymour the Lord Protector, England became more Protestant, and the people of Whitchurch were persecuted for their religious beliefs for six years until the death of Edward and the succession of Mary. \n\nAlso during the 16th century, under the reign of Elizabeth the town had become large and prosperous enough to send its first two members to Parliament in 1586. Until 1832, it was known as a Rotten Borough, as the members were nominated by an absent landlord.\n\nThe town hall was built during the reign of Queen Anne. In 1712, Henri de Portal, a Huguenot refugee from France, established a paper mill at Bere Mill in Whitchurch, producing exceptionally hard and close-textured paper. The quality of the paper was considered so high that within twelve years, Portal was supplying the Bank of England, a tradition that still continues. Portal eventually naturalised to English nationality, and established a second mill at Laverstoke; in more recent times the business moved to neighbouring Overton, where it is still based today. He died in 1747, and is buried at All Hallows, Whitchurch.\n\nIn 1888, the \"Star\" newspaper reported: Whitchurch is in Hampshire. People who live IN it call it a town. People who live OUT of it call it a village. It is about as big as a good-sized pocket handkerchief. It has three shops and 19 public houses.\n\nAlso in 1888, Charles Denning and Clara Thomas married in Lincoln. They set up home in Whitchurch, where Clara's father had purchased two houses for them in Newbury Street. Here Charles established a drapery business. It was also here that one of their children, Alfred Thompson or \"Tom\", grew up. He later became one of the most renowned judges in English legal history – Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls. The house in Newbury Street is today marked with a commemorative plaque. Before returning to the Court of Appeal as Master of the Rolls, Denning, for a time, was a member of the judicial committee of the House of Lords, taking the title Baron Denning of Whitchurch.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the Salvation Army and its open-air services were the dominant talking point. They maintained that they had a right to hold these services but were prosecuted for obstructing the highways and causing a disturbance. The conviction in 1889 of one group, and their subsequent treatment by the authorities, led to demonstrations. In October 1889, 5000 Salvationists and 12 Salvation Army bands demonstrated in the Town Square at Whitchurch. They were charged with riot, unlawful assembly and rout, and the Salvationists applied for the case to be heard in the High Court of Justice. In July 1890, the court found in their favour and set down laws granting the public the right to hold orderly public demonstrations, which were the rules followed until the beginning of the 21st century, when the government overturned them.\n\nDuring the night of 7 February 2018, Henri de Portal's former paper mill, Bere Mill, which had been converted into a farmhouse, was largely destroyed by a major fire.\n\nThe Saxon church was the original \"white church\", because it was built of limestone or chalk. The church and all its property were given by Henry de Blois in 1132 to St Cross Hospital in Winchester and the gift was confirmed by Richard I in 1189.\n\nLittle is known about the earlier Saxon structure because its Norman lords built a more imposing successor which is the basis of the present parish church of All Hallows. One Saxon remnant is the grave cover of Frithburga. The first stage was completed in about 1190 when the three western bays on the south side of the nave were added. A north aisle was added in the 15th century. The tower was re-built in 1716 but still features the original oak stair turret. The whole church was largely re-built in 1866 and the square Norman tower was capped by a Gothic Revival spire.\n\nIt is a Grade 2* Listed Building and the oldest remaining structure in the town. All Hallows is also widely known for its 3-manual pipe organ with 41 stops dating from 1935, and a peal of 10 bells in the tower. The earliest of the six bells in the tower is of 15th-century origin and the others were gifts made in the 17th and 18th centuries. The bells were cast in a field belonging to a farm in Wood Street, now called Bell Street. The spire of All Hallows weighs 500 tons and is held in place by its own weight.\n\nThe population is 8,962. The town is a growing community with a combination of residential areas and some light industry, and serves as a small commuter town to London (approximately 60 miles to the east) and to a lesser extent Basingstoke, Andover, Newbury and Winchester. Lynch Hill Park, a small housing development, was used in a TV advert for Roysters crisps because of its \"typical\" American appearance. The centre of the town is a roundabout known as The Square.\n\nThe B3400 road (Basingstoke to Andover) runs through the town. Bus services include Stagecoach routes 76 (Andover-Whitchurch-Overton-Basingstoke) and 86 (Winchester-South wonston-Sutton Scotney and Whitchurch town centre ) The railway station is at the north end of the town. The former Whitchurch Town railway station (closed 1960) was closer to the town centre.\n\nTestbourne Community School is a foundation school and was rated as \"outstanding\" in November 2010 by Ofsted. It has had performing arts specialist status since\n2005 and educates around 1000 students aged 11–16.\n\nWhitchurch Church of England Primary School serves the younger students in the town and its surrounding areas. It was rated in January 2011 as \"good\" with a number of \"outstanding\" features, by OFSTED. The headteacher, Sarah Peters, started in April 2008, and left in 2014. Zoe Newton, the deputy headteacher, acted as headmistress until September 2015. The current headteacher is Kate Steven.\n\nWhitchurch has a Non-League football club Whitchurch United F.C., which plays at Longmeadow. Also at the Longmeadow sports facility is a Bowls club with indoor and outdoor pitches, and a Squash club with 2 squash courts.\nWhitchurch also have two Cricket teams playing at the local Cricket Ground (Parsonage Meadow) where skipper Simon Ralph and his band of merry little cricketing men try to avoid relegation for the second year in a row.\n\nAs well as the thriving amateur theatre group called WADS, which was established in 1958, there is also an annual beer festival held at the Longmeadow Sports and Social Club, this is run by the North Hampshire branch of the Campaign for Real Ale.\nBeing positioned on the Southern edge of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty as well as at the junction of several river valleys, Whitchurch has many opportunities for cycling, both strenuous and sedate, on-road and off. Popular cycle routes include over to the Bourne Valley, the Hampshire County Council Off-Road Mountainbike loop, and down the Test Valley to Longparish.\n\nThere is a BMX cycle track and a 'Sk8' board area in Daniel Park, which together with its adjoining open space next to the primary school, has been put forward as a Queen Elizabeth II field in the hope of protecting it forever.\n\nThe Whitchurch Town Council maintains a couple of children's playgrounds: one in Kingsley Park, and the other at the bottom of Alliston Way between the schools. Other play areas are at Caesar's Way and Park View.\n\nThe River Test throughout the town, including its various branches and banks, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nMuch of the land to the south of the town centre is old water meadow. One site is administered by Whitchurch Millennium Green Trust, a registered charity. This has an old dam used for flooding the meadow in the past and a sluice and wooden sheep dip hundreds of years old. Its ponds have viewing platforms. The old maps show how it was fed by springs. One key spring still exists at Ninesprings Nursery on The Weir. It originally fed what is now thought to be some of the oldest watercress beds in Britain. They are shown on the 1810 map and the 1872 and 1876 maps show them clearly also the history of how the River Test was diverted. The site now grows aquatic plants that are distributed nationally.\n\nWhitchurch was ranked first in the BT \"Race to Infinity\" competition that finished on 31 December 2010. The win meant that the residents served from the exchange (01256-89 prefix) would be one of the first ten rural areas in Britain to be upgraded to fibre-optic technology. The hope was that this would bring faster Internet speeds sooner to residences, businesses, schools and doctors both in the town itself and to its surrounding villages and the rural communities in-between.\n\nThe Whitchurch \"Faster Broadband Campaign\" saw participation by many volunteers who went \"door knocking\" in the midst of a severe December snowstorm to secure the votes required to win. In the end, the final score was 104%, as many people without landlines or Internet access were able to cast their vote. In addition, the town also won £5000 of computer equipment from BT for use by a community project. The money was split between the primary school and the Whitchurch Association who created an IT Library.\n\nThe Whitchurch Association, a registered charity, spearheaded the campaign and the collection of ideas for the community project; the Whitchurch Town Council underwrote the campaign and several local businesses contributed. The campaign was also supported by the schools, the doctor's surgery, churches, and politicians, including the area's local MP, The Rt Hon Sir George Young Bt.\n\nRoll-out began in May 2012 but progress to reach everyone in town – and in the neighbouring areas – was slow. Some people report that the actual speeds they obtained using the new system was not as fast as they were led to believe they would be.\n\nFollowing a grant from SEEDA, the town website was launched on 1 May 2010. The site is administered by the Whitchurch Association on behalf of the town residents. Any resident is able to contribute, and the site's ethos is non-political, following that of the Whitchurch Association.\n\nA report given by the police to the Whitchurch Town Council on 4 April 2011 stated, \"We have also asked shops in Whitchurch not to sell 'Kick, Red Bull or any other stimulation drinks to youths under 16 on Friday evenings\". The story was picked up by local media and later, national media. The police request came after meetings with the Whitchurch Youth Project and an assembly at Testbourne school, in a bid to reduce anti-social behaviour.\n\nActually two days, the last full weekend in January, see the arrival in the town of around 2,000 keen gardeners from all over the South of England searching for seed potatoes not available anywhere else in the country. The event boasts the largest selection of varieties available to amateur growers in one place in the world; in 2008 that was 143.\n\n\n\n"}

Dick. It was received by the Scott Meredith Literary Agency on June 24, 1953, and first published in the April 1954 issue of \"If\" magazine. The story was illustrated by Kelly Freas in its original publication. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the existence of potentially powerful mutants has become a reality. The mutants are seen as dangerous and have been hunted to death by human beings for years. A golden-skinned mutant called Cris is captured by the government, which attempts to execute him. However, his appearance and abilities to see into the future allow him to escape.\n\nThe protagonists of the story are a government agent and his fiancée who are members of a government agency tasked with tracking down and sterilizing or eliminating mutants- individuals with physical abnormalities and superhuman powers (such as the ability to steal the appearance and memories of others) that make them a threat to normal humans. The eponymous \"Golden Man\" is a feral young man named Cris with gold-colored skin, who does not appear to be sapient but possesses the ability to see into the future (specifically, the ability to see all possible outcomes from any single action, described in the story as similar to a chess player with the ability to see all possible moves 5 steps ahead). The agency manages to capture Cris, but does not execute him immediately, due to their wish to study his ability. Unknown to the agency, Cris turns out to possess another power; his golden skin acts like a lion's mane and allows him to seduce members of the opposite sex. Cris influences the fiancée into freeing him, then impregnates her and makes his escape. The story ends with the protagonist reflecting on how animal instincts have triumphed over human intellect, and how that is the new direction evolution will take if Cris succeeds in replacing humanity.\n\nCopyright protection for \"If\", Apr. 1954, and its contents was created under Registration Number B00000456995. \"The Golden Man\" is in the public domain in the United States because it was published in the United States between January 1, 1950 and December 31, 1963 and copyright was not renewed with the US Copyright Office within the proper one-year period (beginning on December 31 of the 27th year of the copyright and running through December 31 of the following year). When renewal registration was not made within the statutory time limit, the copyright expired at the end of its first term and protection was lost permanently.\n\nAfter the author's death, a nonexistent story with the same title was falsely included in renewal Registration Number RE0000190631 (1983-11-22) War veteran, and other contributions by Philip K. Dick, as \"(In If: worlds of science fiction, Apr. 1955) The Golden man. Pub. 1955-02-10; B00000518554\" This created the deceptive appearance that \"The Golden Man\" is still under United States copyright protection.\n\nIn the Story Notes for the collection \"The Golden Man\", Dick wrote of the eponymous short story:\n\nThe film \"Next\", a very loose adaptation of \"The Golden Man\", was released in 2007. It was directed by Lee Tamahori and stars Nicolas Cage as Cris Johnson and co-stars Julianne Moore, Jessica Biel, Thomas Kretschmann, and Peter Falk.\n\n"}

His real name is Mustafa Faraj Muhammad Muhammad Masud al-Jadid al-Uzaybi. He was arrested by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) on May 2, 2005, in Mardan ( north of Peshawar). Finding al-Libi was a joint effort of the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Special Activities Division and Pakistan's Special Forces.\n\nSince September 2006, al-Libi has been held in American military custody in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, having previously been held at a secret location.\n\nAccording to the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, he served as the third in command of al-Qaeda, from the 2003 capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to his own capture in 2005.\n\nIn approximately 2000, al-Libi was living in the Karte Parwan district of Kabul, Afghanistan.\n\nIn August 2004, Pakistani officials stated that al-Libi had become \"number three\" in al-Qaeda as \"director of operations\", a role once filled by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.\n\nUpon al-Libi's arrest on May 2, 2005, U.S. and Pakistani authorities continued to claim him as the third most important figure in al-Qaeda. According to the BBC and Voice of America (VOA) reports, he was riding pillion on a motorbike when he and his driver were ambushed by Pakistani agents, some of whom were wearing burqas. A VOA reporter from Mardan said that while being apprehended, al-Libi tried to destroy a notebook, which U.S. agents took and have tried to decode.\n\nU.S. agents had been trying to find al-Libi as a link to finding Osama bin Laden. After they intercepted a mobile phone call made by him, they targeted his location to a busy road a quarter of a mile away on the outskirts of Mardan, about northwest of Islamabad, and tipped-off Pakistani authorities. Plainclothes Pakistani agents arrived in Mardan and waited for him to arrive.\n\nAbu Faraj al-Libi was identified by Pakistani authorities as the main planner of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. He is also a suspect in two assassination attempts against Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf. According to \"The New York Times\", \"Mr. Libbi's suspected accomplice in those attacks was a well-known Pakistani militant named Amjad Farooqi, who was also implicated in the murder of the 'Wall Street Journal' reporter Daniel Pearl in February 2002. Mr. Farooqi was killed last September in a shootout with security forces in southern Pakistan.\"\nIn the early reporting of this capture, there was confusion between the names and identities of Abu Faraj al-Libi and another wanted al-Qaeda fugitive, Anas al-Liby. \"Al-Libi\" is not a surname, but an adjective, meaning \"the Libyan\". Such adjectives of nationality are used in nicknames, and sometimes to resolve ambiguity; they often have several alternative English transliterations.\n\nScholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations:\n\n\nOn January 21, 2009, the day he was inaugurated, United States President Barack Obama issued three executive orders related to the detention of individuals in Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\nThat new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the Guantanamo Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was insufficient evidence to justify charging them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request.\nAbu Faraj al-Libi was one of the 71 individuals deemed unable to be charged due to insufficient evidence, but too dangerous to release.\nObama said those deemed unable to be charged due to insufficient evidence, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board.\n\nThe first review wasn't convened until November 20, 2013.\n\n"}

A sedan version is marketed as the Chevrolet Prisma. 600,000 Celtas have been built in Gravataí, more than one hundred thousand per year.\n\nIt was released in 2000 in Brazil as a three-door hatchback with a gasoline engine, based on the Corsa B and with design features similar to those of the Vectra. In 2002 a five-door version was made available, and the engine power was increased to at 6,400 rpm, the same VHC (Very High Compression) technology used in the Latin American Corsa C. A gasoline engine was added in 2003.\n\nAn \"Off-Road\" accessories kit was for sale for both old and new Celtas in 2005, and the 1.0 L was converted into a gasoline-ethanol flexible fuel engine (gasoline versions are still available, especially outside Brazil).\n\nIn 2006, the Celta underwent a facelift, which provided for a more modern look and an enhancement of build quality. The new front fascia makes it closer to new Chevrolet models, especially the new Brazilian Vectra.\n\nA sedan version, named Chevrolet Prisma was released in early 2007. It was not meant to replace Classic (a low cost sedan version of the Corsa B) neither the Corsa Sedan (C), but to fill a market gap between them instead. The only available engine option is a 1.4 L Econo.Flex gasoline/ethanol flexible fuel engine. Its high compression rate gives as a result a maximum output of 97 PS when running on ethanol and 95 hp when running on gasoline.\n\nEarly 2009 marked the release of the Prisma 1.0 litre and the new VHC-E engine ( gasoline and ethanol) for Prisma and Celta. By early 2012, 1.5 million Celtas had been built in Gravataí.\n\nThe Chevrolet Celta has been rated as highly unsafe by Latin NCAP in 2011, scoring only one star for adult occupants and two stars for children. Important to mention that when Celta was developed (1996) there was no Latin NCAP protocol available and that all regulatory safety items were met for the countries were Celta was sold.\n\nThe 1.0 L gasoline engine has a high power to displacement ratio (51 kW/L, 70 PS/L or 1.1 hp/cu in). However, this power is only available at 6400 rpm, and the maximum torque is 8.6 kgf·m (88 N·m) at 3000 rpm. Today, the Celta is sold only with the 1.0 FlexPower (the 1.4 MPFI stopping production in 2007). In 2002 GM changed the 1.0 MPFI () engine to a 1.0 VHC (), in 2005 to VHC FlexPower (70 PS with Petrol or alcohol), and in 2009 to VHCE FlexPower (77 PS with Petrol and 78 PS with alcohol). The total weight is approximately 850 kg (1,872 lb). In Uruguay, Celta 1.4 MPFI are available since 2009 as the 'new' Celta with the new front lights and all facelift add-ons. This model continues on sell in 2012 and manufacturing dates of the units are from 2011 (1.4 MPFI engines didn't stop production in 2007).\n\nIn 2012, General Motors announced the new Chevrolet Onix to succeed part of versions of Celta.\n\n\n"}

Originally produced at the Aspern engine plant, production was moved to the Szentgotthard engine plant in Hungary with the introduction of the DOHC version. GM do Brasil at São José dos Campos, GMDAT at Bupyeong and GM North America at Toluca also build these engines.\n\nThe Family 1 engines are inline-four cylinder engines with belt-driven single or double overhead camshafts in an aluminum cylinder head with a cast iron engine block. GM do Brasil versions were also capable of running on ethanol. These engines are sometimes referred to as \"Small-block\" engines by enthusiasts; in contrast to the larger Family II engines which are sometimes referred to as the \"Big-block\" engines.\n\nGM do Brasil specializes in SOHC, petrol-powered and \"FlexPower\" (powered with ethanol and/or petrol, mixed in any percentage) engines. GM Brasil also made 16-valve versions of the 1.0 engine. The 1.0 L 16v was available in the Corsa line-up from 1999 to 2001.\n\nThe version has a bore and a stroke.\n\nThe version was used in the Opel Corsa.\n\nThe version has a bore and a stroke.\n\nThe version has a bore and a stroke.\n\nThe version has a bore and an stroke.\n\nThe version has an bore and an stroke.\n\nApplications:\n\nThe SPE / 4 or (\"Smart Performance Economy 4 cylinders\") engines are an evolution of the Econo.Flex engines that were made in Brazil at the \"Joinville\" plant. There are two available displacements: 1.0 L and 1.4 L. They feature an SOHC head with 2-valves per cylinder, and is fed by a multi-point fuel injection system, which allows it to run on either E100 (pure ethanol) or E25 gasoline (standard in Brazil). Major differences between previous engines include reduced friction, lowered weight, individual coil-near-plug ignition, and a new cylinder head design.\n\nThis was the first engine in this family, featuring a Lotus-developed 16-valve cylinder head and a cast-iron cylinder block which was essentially the same as in Opel's 8-valve engines. C16XE was available only in Corsa GSi, model years 1993 and 1994. C16XE was not yet badged Ecotec, and for later model Corsas and Opel Tigras it was replaced with X16XE Ecotec engine. The main difference between C16XE and X16XE Ecotec is emission control, C16XE lacks EGR and AIR-system, although the cylinder head is designed to enable these features. Other differences between C16XE and later versions of the engine include intake manifold, C16XE has a plastic upper intake manifold, which was replaced with a cast aluminium manifold, and fuel injection system, C16XE uses Multec fuel injection with MAF sensor and later models used Multec fuel injection with MAP sensor. Also, while C16XE had its own exhaust front section design, for X16XE it was replaced with a front section used also in Opel Astra, probably as a cost-saving measure.\n\nApplications:\n\n\nThe first generation Ecotec engines are belt-driven 16-valve DOHC engines, with cast-iron cylinder blocks and aluminum cross-flow cylinder heads. They feature sodium-filled exhaust valves, a cast steel crankshaft, and a spheroidal graphite flywheel. They also feature exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), secondary air injection, and \"Multec M\" engine control with sequential multiport fuel injection. The 1.6 L version was also exported for use in the Brazilian Corsa GSi.\n\nApplications:\n\nUpdated version introduced from 2000, with lighter cast-iron cylinder block and camshaft driven by toothed belt. Features EGR valve and electronic throttle for reduced emissions.\nEcotec TwinPort Family 1 engine is used in:\n\nDaewoo Motors licensed and produced a variant of the \"Family 1\" engine. These engines were built exclusively at Bupyeong engine plant and marketed as \"E-TEC\". Like all \"Family 1\" engines they feature a toothed belt driven valvetrain, a cast iron engine block and an aluminum cylinder head. Most models feature Euro III-compliancy, and the 1.4 L (1399 cc) and 1.6 L (1598cc) versions employ variable intake geometry. With the release of Chevrolet Cruze, the factory has been converted to produce the Ecotec Family 1 \"Gen III\" block.\n\nApplications:\n\nThe \"E-TEC II 16V\" is an updated version of the \"E-TEC\" engines with DOHC.\n\nApplications:\n\nThe new \"Generation III\" or Gen III engine entered production in Spring 2005. These engines replaced both the previous generation \"Ecotec\" engines as well as Daewoo's \"E-TEC 16V\" engines. These engines are manufactured at Szentgotthárd, Hungary, Bupyeoung, Korea, Toluca, Mexico and Yantai, PRC (SGM).\n\nIn contrast to their predecessors, the \"Gen III\" engines feature lighter cast-iron blocks, as well as higher compression ratios. These engines also implement DCVCP (Double Continuous Variable Cam Phasing technology, a variant of VVT), piston cooling by oil jets, and an integrated catalytic converter. Non-turbocharged variants feature the \"TwinPort\" (Variable-length intake manifold) technology.\nThe drive belt for the camshafts is wider and stronger than before, and water pump is not driven by it anymore which improves reliability.\n\nThe LDE engine meets Euro VI and KULEV emission standards. With the addition of secondary air injection to the LUW engine, the LWE achieves PZEV status.\n\nThese engines like their DOHC predecessors feature bucket tappets in contrast to the roller finger followers found on GM's other 4-cylinder engines.\n\nApplications:\n\nTurbocharged \"Gen III\" engines are used in:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1839694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839694", "title": "The Legend of Suriyothai", "text": "The Legend of Suriyothai\n\nThe Legend of Suriyothai is a 2001 Thai film directed by Chatrichalerm Yukol, portrays the life of a historical figure, who is regarded by Thai people as the \"great feminist\" Queen Suriyothai. It records the climax when she takes her battle elephant in front of the Burmese army and sacrifices herself to save the life of her king Maha Chakkraphat and his kingdom.\n\nThe story follows the course of the life of Suriyothai from her adolescence to her death. As Suriyothai is only known from three lines in a chronicle, most of the film relies on an invented story rather than claiming to be actual history. It presents a young woman, Suriyothai, of minor royal standing who has strong opinions and self-determination. The movie reveals the princess' boldness through scenes where she breaks tradition by walking among the commoners to meet her lover Prince Pirenthorathep, who in turn pledges that he will come to her aid whenever she wants.\n\nHer father insists that she must marry Prince Thienraja, the son of the second king of the realm. In an attempt to escape a marriage she does not want, she runs away and is captured by the principal king who explains the possible problems her marriage to Piren might cause to Siam. For the good of the kingdom, she marries Prince Tien to keep peace in the royal families. From this point on she remains loyal to the man she likes but does not love and remains strongly independent.\n\nThe principal king dies, and Tien's father inherits the throne. A few years later, smallpox makes its first appearance in Siam and the king is stricken with the disease. On his deathbed he extracts a promise of support for his young son from Chai Raja, his nephew, and Tien. Burma invades in the north and Chai Raja assumes the throne to protect Siam. He executes the child king, which Tien protests but on Suriyothai's advice accepts Chai Raja as his ruler.\n\nChai Raja's wife, Queen Jitravadee, dies shortly after giving birth to the heir Yodfa. The king takes a new consort, Srisudachan, and has a son by her. After several years of peace, Chai Raja leaves the capital, Ayutthaya, for a military campaign in the north. Soon after, Srisudachan, descended from the deposed U-Tong dynasty, takes Boonsri Worawongsa, another U-Tong descendant, as a lover and starts plotting to take over the throne.\n\nThe king is wounded in battle and comes back to the capital to recuperate, where Srisudachan poisons him and attempts to blame the deed on Tien. Tien saves his own life by becoming a Buddhist monk. Srisudachan proceeds by naming Worawongsa as regent and promptly poisoning young Yodfa, thereby assuming power. Suriyothai then summons her old friend Piren, who was Chai Raja's troop commander, to help set things right. His troops ambush and kill Worawongsa and Srisudachan, and Tien accepts the throne despite his monkhood.\n\nUpon hearing this, Burmese King Hongsa invades again and lays siege to Ayutthaya. In a dramatic finale, however, the Burmese invade the new kingdom, and Queen Suriyothai heroically rides into battle with her husband and her unrequited childhood love at her side. The queen is slain, falling in slow motion from the elephant in full uniform with her throat cut. The ending scene reveals a traditional funeral for royals.\n\nThe film was financed by Queen Sirikit, who appointed royal family members to the directorial position (Chatrichalerm) and to the role of the lead actress. Chatrichalerm wrote the screenplay and directed. Kamla, his wife, designed the costumes and served as a producer. Because of Queen Sirikit's backing, when the script called for a large number of men in the battle scenes, Royal Thai Army and Royal Thai Navy personnel were called upon to help make up the thousands of extras required.\n\nChatrichalerm states that \"The Legend of Suriyothai\" was originally the idea of Queen Sirikit. According to Chatrichalerm, the Queen wanted the Thai people to have a better understanding of their history and felt that a motion picture would be a good way to accomplish this. Chatrichalerm and Queen Sirikit mutually agreed to use \"Suriyothai\" as their first subject.\n\nDocuments sent to King John III of Portugal (1521–1557) from Domingos de Seixas, a mercenary in the Ayutthaya Kingdom from 1524 to 1549, were consulted. The film depicts some Portuguese, and their introduction of Early Modern warfare, but the only one with a speaking part depicts a physician called to the deathbed of the poisoned king. A follow-up film on King Naresuan, \"King Naresuan\" was release in 2007.\n\nAmporn Jirattikorn argues that other motivations for the film included a fear of foreign influence after the 1997 Asian financial crisis and competition from another historical figure, the sister to King Naresuan. According to Jirattikorn, the film attempts to provide a national hero connected to the current monarchical dynasty, in contrast to other Thai films presenting events of the same era (e.g., \"Bang Rajan\").\n\nThe movie uses many locations and sites in Thailand as its sets and with its massive cast and expensive production richly displays life in the 16th century. The battle scenes employed thousands of extras and there are hundreds of real elephants used as moving battle platforms. It took three years to shoot. It is rumored that the film cost between US$8 and 20 million, making it the most expensive Thai film ever made. However, due to the involvement of the Thai Royal Family, any figure is hard to substantiate. Additionally, the royal family’s association with this motion picture allowed filming in locations that would have been difficult or even impossible for any other director to access.\n\nWhen the film was released on August 12, 2001 in Thailand, it was simply titled \"Suriyothai\" and had a running time of 185 minutes. This is pared down quite a bit from its intended eight-hour length. A five-hour version exists in a DVD box-set released in Thailand.\n\nIn 2003, it was released in the United States, with a running time of 142 minutes. This version was edited by Francis Ford Coppola. The US release by Sony Pictures Classics in association with Coppola's company American Zoetrope was entitled \"Francis Ford Coppola Presents: The Legend of Suriyothai\". Some critics argue that the original Thai release was the better presentation of the film, with others even preferring the five-hour DVD set, which does have English subtitles.\n\nThe film stars another Thai royal, Piyapas Bhirombhakdi, as Queen Sri Suriyothai. She is a royal descendant, carrying the title M.L., or Mom Luang.\n\nThai pop star Mai Charoenpura is among the highlighted performers, portraying the scheming Lady Srisudachan. Other cast members include Sarunyu Wongkrachang as Prince Thien, Chatchai Plengpanich as Lord Piren and Johnny Anfone as Lord Worawongsa.\n\nOther actors and actresses from Thai film history appear, including action-movie veteran Sombat Metanee and Sorapong Chatree, who appeared in many of Chatrichalerm's films in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\nIn his review of \"The Legend of Suriyothai\" in technohistory.com, Steve Sanderson states \"The film's celebration of female power is initially refreshing, suggesting some nascent feminist impulse.\"\n\nWhen she marries Prince Tien to keep peace she remains loyal to the man she likes but does not love and remains independent. According to \"The New York Times\" review, this sacrifice is act of placing patriotic duty and family loyalty over her own feelings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1839695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839695", "title": "Darkman", "text": "Darkman\n\nDarkman is a 1990 American superhero film directed and co-written by Sam Raimi. It is based on a short story Raimi wrote that paid homage to Universal's horror films of the 1930s. The film stars Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake, a scientist who is brutally attacked, disfigured and left for dead by a ruthless mobster, Robert Durant (Larry Drake), after his girlfriend, an attorney (Frances McDormand), runs afoul of a corrupt developer (Colin Friels). After a failed treatment to cure him of his burn injuries, Westlake develops super-human abilities, which also have the unintended side-effect of rendering him mentally unstable and borderline psychotic. Consumed with vengeance, he decides to hunt down the men responsible for his disfigurement.\n\nUnable to secure the rights to either \"The Shadow\" or \"Batman\", Raimi decided to create his own superhero and struck a deal with Universal Studios to make his first Hollywood studio film. It was produced by Robert Tapert, and was written by Raimi, his brother Ivan Raimi and Chuck Pfarrer. The design and creation of the makeup effects required to turn Liam Neeson into Darkman were the handiwork of makeup effects artist Tony Gardner, who also cameos in the film as the Lizard Man in the carnival Freak Show sequence.\n\nNeeson's first action film, \"Darkman\" received generally positive reviews by critics and was a box office success, grossing almost $49 million worldwide, well above its $16 million budget. This financial success spawned two direct-to-video sequels, \"\" (1995) and \"\" (1996), as well as comic books, video games, and action figures. Neeson does not reprise his role for the direct-to-video sequels.\n\nDr. Peyton Westlake is developing a new type of synthetic skin to help burn victims, but cannot get past a flaw that causes the skin to rapidly disintegrate after 99 minutes. His girlfriend, attorney Julie Hastings, discovers the Belisarius Memorandum, an incriminating document that proves developer Louis Strack Jr. has been bribing members of the zoning commission. When she confronts Strack, he confesses, showing Julie that he plans to design a brand new city, creating a substantial number of new jobs. He warns Julie that the city's reigning crime boss, Robert Durant, also wants the document.\n\nAt Westlake's lab, Westlake and his assistant Yakatito are testing the skin when the lights go out. The synthetic skin is stable after 100 minutes; Westlake deduces the skin is photosensitive. Their joy is short lived as Durant and his mobsters show up and demand the Memorandum, which Westlake knows nothing about. They search for the document, and Durant has his men kill Yakatito and beat Westlake, burning his hands and dipping his face in acid. After finding the document, they rig the lab to explode; it does so as Julie watches. The blast throws a hideously burned Westlake through the roof and into the river. As a John Doe, he is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the spinothalamic tract; physical pain is no longer felt at the cost of tactile sensation. This loss of sensory input gives him enhanced strength due to adrenal overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but also mentally destabilizes him.\n\nBelieved dead by Julie, Westlake re-establishes his lab in a condemned building and begins a long process of digitization to create a mask of his original face. Westlake uses the time to plot revenge against Durant and his men; he kills Durant's henchman Rick after forcing him to reveal the identities of the other men, then studies them to subdue and impersonate them (having a talent for impressionism). When his face mask is complete, Westlake manages to convince Julie that he was in a coma rather than dead. He mentions that he is aware of Julie seeing Strack after his supposed death; she responds that Strack only comforted her. Keeping his disfigurement from her, Westlake instead probes whether or not she would accept him, regardless of his appearance.\n\nWestlake sows dissension and confusion among Durant's henchmen by assuming their identities. On a date at a carnival with Julie, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper, revealing to Julie that something is wrong with him. He flees as his face begins to melt, and she follows him, discovering the discarded mask; she calls to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie tells Strack she can no longer see him before discovering the stolen Memorandum on his desk, confirming he was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She reveals Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her as long as he has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told to capture Julie and kill Westlake.\n\nDurant intercepts Julie, kidnapping her before attacking Westlake's lair. Two of his men enter the lab to locate and kill Westlake, but are outmaneuvered and eliminated. Durant flees in a helicopter with Westlake dangling from an attached cable, which he uses to crash the helicopter. Impersonating Durant, Westlake meets up with Strack and a captive Julie at the top of an unfinished building. Westlake's ruse is broken by Strack and they fight; Westlake eventually gains the upper hand and dangles Strack by his ankle in the air. Strack says that killing him would not be something he could live with; Westlake drops Strack, and he falls to his death in the construction site below, remarking: \"I'm learning to live with a lot of things.\" Julie tries to convince Westlake that he can still return to his old life, but he tells her he has changed on the inside as well, and cannot subject anyone to his new, vicious nature. He rushes from Julie as they exit an elevator, pulling on a mask and running into a crowd of pedestrians. As Julie unsuccessfully searches for him, Westlake watches her for a few moments before turning and walking away, narrating, \"I am everyone and no one. Everywhere. Nowhere. Call me ... Darkman.\"\n\n\nIn addition, Bruce Campbell has a cameo in the film as Peyton's last seen disguise (credited as \"Final Shemp\"). Raimi's brother Ivan and director John Landis have cameos as hospital staff, while Jenny Agutter has an uncredited cameo as the doctor treating Westlake's burns.\n\nFor a long time, Sam Raimi had been interested in adapting a comic book into a film. He had pursued and failed to secure the rights to both \"The Shadow\" and \"Batman\" and decided to create his own. The initial idea Raimi had for \"Darkman\" was of a man who could change his face. He has said that he drew inspiration from those films as well as \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and \"The Elephant Man\". Raimi was also inspired by the Universal horror films of the 1930s and 1940s because \"they made me fear the hideous nature of the hero and at the same time drew me to him. I went back to that idea of the man who is noble and turns into a monster\". He originally wrote a 30-page short story, titled \"The Darkman\", and then developed into a 40-page treatment. At this point, according to Raimi, \"it became the story of a man who had lost his face and had to take on other faces, a man who battled criminals using this power\". It also became more of a tragic love story in the tradition of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". In 1987, Raimi submitted the treatment to Universal Pictures which they liked, green-lighted a budget in the range of $8–12 million, and suggested that he get a screenwriter to flesh out the story.\n\nThe more Raimi worked, the more Darkman became a crime-fighting figure, \"a non-superpowered man who, here, is a hideous thing who fights crime. As he became that hideous thing, it became more like \"The Phantom of the Opera\", the creature who wants the girl but who was too much of a beast to have her,\" Raimi said. The process of developing his treatment into a screenplay was difficult with Raimi hiring ex-Navy SEAL Chuck Pfarrer based on his work on \"Navy SEALs\". He wrote the first draft and then Raimi's brother, Ivan (a doctor), wrote drafts two through four with Sam. Ivan made sure that the medical aspects and scientific elements were authentic as possible given the nature of the story.\n\nAs Raimi and his producing partner Robert Tapert progressed through various drafts, they realized that there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and \"lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions.\" Goldin said that they \"spent a lot of time talking and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story.\" The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, \"I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves.\"\n\nWorking with Universal meant a significant increase in budget for Raimi. This allowed him to design and build a laboratory set for Darkman and afford helicopters and professional stuntmen to film the climactic helicopter chase through the city. He was eventually given $16 million to work with, including a longer schedule and much more effects work.\n\nVisually, the filmmaker was interested in paying homage to Universal horror films of the 1930s. Production designer Randy Ser remarked, \"if you look at Darkman's lab that he moves into, which is an old warehouse, what was on my mind was Dr. Frankenstein. There were a number of references visually to what we were thinking about in regards to those films.\" Raimi consciously wanted to tone down his style because of a desire to \"get into the characters' heads and follow them as real human beings in extraordinary circumstances\".\n\nMcDormand and Neeson worked closely in rehearsals, rewriting the three love scenes they had together after he becomes Darkman. They got through these scenes, according to the actress, by depending on \"each other's knowledge, of theater and each other.\"\n\nThe film was shot on location in Los Angeles and Toronto, Ontario.\n\nRaimi said directing McDormand was \"very difficult\". Raimi said, \"apparently I didn't know Fran as well as I thought I did ... The reason it was difficult was that our conception of the best movie to make differed, arguing in trying to make the best picture possible. We did come across disagreements, but they were very healthy.\"\n\nDurant's finger collection developed over the Pfarrer and Raimi brothers drafts. The director wanted a specific trademark for the character – one that hinted at a military background.\n\nNeeson worked in ten-piece prosthetic makeup, sometimes for 18 hours. He saw the lengthy time spent in extensive makeup as a challenge and liked \"the idea of working behind a mask on camera, and just exploring the possibilities of what that entailed.\" He and makeup effects designer Tony Gardner did tests using specific glues, foams, and bandage coverings. They also timed how fast they could apply the prosthetic makeup and put the costume on. Neeson worked with the costume designer on his outfit, including aspects like the cloak. The hardest part for the actor was speaking with false teeth and he ended up doing \"a lot of work on my voice – I didn't want the [false teeth] to move at all.\"\n\nRaimi and Tapert ran into conflicts with the studio during post-production. The director had a problem with the editor that the studio assigned him and eight weeks into assembling the rough cut, he was not following Raimi's storyboards. The editor had a nervous breakdown and left. Early preview screenings did not go well as people laughed in the wrong places and complained about a lack of a happy ending. Universal told Raimi that some people rated \"Darkman\" the worst film they had ever seen. According to executives, the film was one of the worst-scoring pictures in Universal's history. Then, two preview screenings, one with Danny Elfman's score, went well. Tapert remembers, \"the experience on \"Darkman\" was very difficult for Sam and me; it isn't the picture we thought it should be, based on the footage we shot and all that. The studio got nervous about some kind of wild things in it, and made us take them out, which was unfortunate.\" However, Raimi did like the \"brilliant\" marketing campaign that the studio came up with, releasing posters in advance with a silhouette of the main character and the question, \"Who is Darkman?\" According to the director, \"the marketing made the film a money-maker.\"\n\nReleased on August 17, 1990, the soundtrack to \"Darkman\" was composed by Danny Elfman, who previously scored the music to Tim Burton's \"Batman\" in 1989. On January 28, 2020, La-La Land Records has released an expanded soundtrack album, featuring over 30 minutes of previously unreleased music.\n\nElfman said of his score, \"Again old-fashioned and melodramatic, but in a way that I'm crazy about. Sam Raimi has a wonderful visual style that lends itself easily to music. It was an enormous relief writing long, extended musical sequences, something which is very rare in modern films. No reason to hold back on this one.\"\n\n\nAds asking \"Who is Darkman?\" began appearing on bus benches, public transit, and television as early as June 1990. Universal VP of Media Vic Fondrk said that the studio did not want to spend much money promoting the film in advance, \"but we wanted to create some intrigue for the Darkman character.\"\n\nOn its opening weekend, \"Darkman\" grossed a total of $8 million in 1,786 theaters. To date, the film has grossed a total of $48.8 million worldwide.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 84% based on reviews from 61 critics. The site's consensus states: \"Gruesome and deliciously broad, Sam Raimi's Darkman bears the haunted soulfulness of gothic tragedy while packing the stylistic verve of onomatopoeia springing off a comic strip page.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 65% based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"Los Angeles Times\" film critic Michael Wilmington felt that \"Darkman\" was the only film at the time \"that successfully captures the graphic look, rhythm and style of the superhero books.\" Terrence Rafferty of \"The New Yorker\" said, \"Raimi works from inside the cheerfully violent adolescent-male sensibility of superhero comics, as if there were no higher style for a filmmaker to aspire to, and the absence of condescension is refreshing.\" \"USA Today\" gave the film three out of four stars. However, Richard Corliss in \"Time\" said that Raimi was not \"effective with actors\" and \"People\"s Ralph Novak called \"Darkman\", a \"loud, sadistic, stupidly written, wretchedly acted film.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a \"B\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"The movie is full of jaunty, Grand Guignol touches (the main gangster enjoys snapping and collecting fingers), but Raimi's images also have a spectral, kinetic beauty.\" In his review for the \"Washington Post\", Joe Brown wrote, \"Though Raimi seems to be trying to restrain himself, his giddily sick sense of humor still pops out all over the place – \"Darkman\" is a frenetic funhouse ride that has you laughing and screaming at the same time.\" On the TV program \"At the Movies\", Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film \"two thumbs up\". Both remarked at how original and stylised Raimi's sense of direction was, with Siskel adding that Darkman as a character was \"interesting\".\n\n\"Darkman\" was singled out for notice by comic-book writer Peter David in the \"Comics Buyer's Guide\" as \"The Perfect Super-Hero Film of All Time,\" although this assessment was based upon other features of the film than general quality. \n\nThe A.V. Club called \"Darkman\" a key transitional film, bridging from Burton’s Batman films, while forging its own dark path to the future.\n\nIn 1998, \"Darkman\" was released on DVD. Bonus material included production notes, cast & crew bios, and a trailer.\n\nIn 1999, \"The Return of Durant\" was released on DVD. Bonus material included production notes, cast & crew bios, a trailer, and web links.\n\nIn 2004, \"Die, Darkman, Die\" was released on DVD as part of the \"Universal Studio Selections\". The DVD contained no bonus material or even a main menu (although there were chapter selections).\n\nOn August 7, 2007, all three \"Darkman\" films were released in a box set by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. Each is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, along with an English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track. No extra material was included. The high definition version of \"Darkman\" was released on HD DVD July 31, 2007.\n\nA Blu-ray Disc edition of the first film was released on June 16, 2010. Shout! Factory released a second Blu-ray edition on February 18, 2014.\n\n\"Darkman\" has been the subject of two Marvel Comics series (one a movie adaptation, the other an original sequel), numerous novels, as well as a video game published by Ocean Software, \"Darkman\" (1991). Tony Gardner's company Alterian, Inc. produced two different Halloween masks of the Darkman character after the film was released. Merchandising for the character all but disappeared for close to a decade until SOTA Toys obtained the rights to make a Darkman action figure. SOTA president Jerry Macaluso was interviewed by Dread Central:\n\nIn 2005, SOTA produced two versions of their Darkman action figure (including interchangeable head and hands to allow the figure to be either bandaged or revealing his scarred visage), as well as a Darkman statue.\n\nDynamite Entertainment announced in 2006 that it had reached an agreement with Universal Studios Consumer Products Group to produce original comics based on \"Darkman\". A bimonthly limited series entitled \"Darkman vs. Army of Darkness\" was published from August 2006 to March 2007.\n\nIn November 2007, Sideshow Collectibles put up for pre-order a 1:4 scale \"Premium\" Format Figure version of Darkman that would be released 3rd Quarter 2008.\n\nUniversal Television financed a 30-minute television pilot based on \"Darkman\", which was made in 1992 and was to be shown on Fox. The pilot, directed by Brian Grant, retold the origin of the character (with some alterations) and introduced several new characters. Christopher Bowen starred in the role of Peyton Westlake/Darkman, Larry Drake reprised his role of Robert G. Durant, and Kathleen York played the cop, Jenny.\n\nThe origin is similar to the one in the original film as Peyton discovers his synthetic skin, is attacked and left for dead by Durant and his gang. In this version, however, Peyton is already married to Julie, and she is killed in the explosion. As in the films, Westlake becomes Darkman, and seeks vengeance on Durant and his gang. Darkman's headquarters are in an abandoned observatory overlooking the city, and he is wanted by the police for his actions against Durant's gang. The pilot ends with some scenes from the first film (particularly of Darkman and Durant fighting) and Darkman stating that Justice will answer with a brand new face.\n\nThe pilot was unaired and never got picked up.\n\nWith release in 1990, Marvel Comics published a 3-issue adaptation of \"Darkman\" in color along with a larger black and white magazine size adaptation consisting of all three issues. In 1993, Darkman returned in a 6 issue mini-series also published by Marvel Comics. In 2006, Dynamite Entertainment published a cross over that pitted Darkman against Sam Raimi's Ash Williams of the \"Evil Dead\"/\"Army of Darkness\" franchise.\n\nAlongside the theatrical release in 1990, Jove Books published the novel adaptation written by Randall Boyll. In 1994, Boyll returned to expand upon the adventures of Darkman in a four-novel miniseries from Pocket Books. Over Pocket Books' four novels (\"The Hangman\", \"The Price of Fear\", \"The Gods of Hell\", and \"In the Face of Death\") Boyll further develops Darkman's character and how he deals with his new existence as an outcast individual with the ability to help others.\n\nThere were two direct-to-video sequels, \"\" (1995) and \"\" (1996).\n\n"}

His general dim-witted behaviour and penchant for bones and sausages has made him an endearing, entertaining character that children still love to this day. Probably his most unusual characteristic is his method of communication. It consists of a loud high pitched squeak that gains its inflection from normal speech and its rhythm from the syllables in each word. The rest of the cast (namely Soo and the presenter) could understand Sweep perfectly, and would (albeit indirectly) translate for the viewer. The original puppeteer (Harry Corbett's brother, Leslie) achieved the sound of Sweep's voice using a saxophone reed. Versions of the puppet later sold as toys had an integral squeaker connected to an air bulb that was squeezed by hand. \n\nSweep's family first appeared on the Sooty Show in an episode called \"Sweep's Family\". He has his mother and father, a twin brother Swoop, two cousins Swipe and Swap and another seven brothers in the litter (all of whom look exactly like him, except that they each wear different coloured collars to tell each other apart). However Swipe and Swap are stated to be Sweep's brothers in the Sooty Heights episode \"the Hounds of Music\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1839701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839701", "title": "Aratta", "text": "Aratta\n\nAratta is a land that appears in Sumerian myths surrounding Enmerkar and Lugalbanda, two early and possibly mythical kings of Uruk also mentioned on the Sumerian king list.\n\nAratta is described as follows in Sumerian literature:\n\nEnmerkar and the Lord of Aratta - The goddess Inanna resides in Aratta, but Enmerkar of Uruk pleases her more than does the lord of Aratta, who is not named in this epic. Enmerkar wants Aratta to submit to Uruk, bring stones down from the mountain, craft gold, silver and lapis lazuli, and send them, along with \"kugmea\" ore to Uruk to build a temple. Inana bids him send a messenger to Aratta, who ascends and descends the \"Zubi\" mountains, and crosses Susa, Anshan, and \"five, six, seven\" mountains before approaching Aratta. Aratta in turn wants grain in exchange. However Inana transfers her allegiance to Uruk, and the grain gains the favor of Aratta's people for Uruk, so the lord of Aratta challenges Enmerkar to send a champion to fight his champion. Then the god Ishkur makes Aratta's crops grow.\n\nEnmerkar and En-suhgir-ana - The lord of Aratta, who is here named \"En-suhgir-ana\" (or \"Ensuhkeshdanna\"), challenges Enmerkar of Uruk to submit to him over the affections of Inanna, but he is rebuffed by Enmerkar. A sorcerer from the recently defeated Hamazi then arrives in Aratta, and offers to make Uruk submit. The sorcerer travels to Eresh where he bewitches Enmerkar's livestock, but a wise woman outperforms his magic and casts him into the Euphrates; En-suhgir-ana then admits the loss of Inanna, and submits his kingdom to Uruk.\n\nLugalbanda in the Mountain Cave - is a tale of Lugalbanda, who will become Enmerkar's successor. Enmerkar's army travels through mountainous territory to wage war against rebellious Aratta. Lugalbanda falls ill and is left in a cave, but he prays to the various gods, recovers, and must find his way out of the mountains.\n\nLugalbanda and the Anzud Bird - Lugalbanda befriends the \"Anzud\" bird, and asks it to help him find his army again. When Enmerkar's army is faced with setback, Lugalbanda volunteers to return to Uruk to ask the goddess Inana's aid. He crosses through the mountains, into the flat land, from the edge to the top of Anshan and then to Uruk, where Inana helps him. She advises Enmerkar to carry off Aratta's \"worked metal and metalsmiths and worked stone and stonemasons\" and all the \"moulds of Aratta will be his\". Then the city is described as having battlements made of green lapis lazuli and bricks made of \"tinstone dug out in the mountains where the cypress grows\".\n\n\nEarly 20th century scholars initially took \"Aratta\" to be an epithet of the Sumerian city Shuruppak related to its local name for the god Enlil; however that is no longer seen to be the case. Although Aratta is known only from myth,\nsome Assyriologists and archaeologists have speculated on possible locations where Aratta could have been, using criteria from the myths:\n\n\nIn 1963, Samuel Noah Kramer thought that a \"Mount Hurum\" in a Lugalbanda myth (which he titled \"Lugalbanda on Mount Hurrum\" at the time) might have referred to the Hurrians, and hence speculated Aratta to be near Lake Urmia.\nHowever, \"Mount Hurum\", \"\"hur-ru-um kur-ra-ka\"\", in what is now called \"Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave\",] is today read \"mountain cave\",\nand Kramer subsequently introduced the title \"Lugalbanda, the Wandering Hero\" for this story.\n\nOther speculations referred to the early gem trade route, the \"Great Khorasan Road\" from the Himalayan Mountains\nto Mesopotamia, which ran through northern Iran.\nAnshan, which had not yet been located then, was assumed to be in the central Zagros mountain range.\nHowever, when Anshan\nwas identified as Tall-i Malyan in 1973,\nit was found to be 600 km south-east of Uruk, far removed from any northerly routes or watercourses from Uruk, and posing the logistical improbability of getting a 27th-century BC Sumerian army through 550 km of Elamite territory to wage war with Aratta.\nNevertheless, there have been speculations referring to eastern Iran as well. Dr. Yousef Majidzadeh believes the Jiroft culture could be Aratta.\n\nBy 1973, archaeologists were noting that there was no archaeological record of Aratta's existence outside of myth, and in 1978 Hansman cautions against over-speculation.\n\nWriters in other fields have continued to hypothesize potential Aratta locations. A \"possible reflex\" has been suggested in Sanskrit \"Āraṭṭa\" or \"Arāṭṭa\" mentioned in the Mahabharata and other texts. \nAlternatively, the name is compared with the toponym Ararat or Urartu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Seland attended Stend Agricultural School (1884–1886). He was editor in \"Nordmands\" in Christiania (1893–96) and before 1896 went back to Nes to take over father's farm. He was deputy to the Parliament of Norway for the Norwegian Liberal Party (1915–18) and for the Norwegian Agrarian Association (1921–24). Locally he was a member of Nes council board and bank auditor for 30 years. Hans Seland, together with Hans Haga and Nils Trædal, were among the most influential politicians in the Agrarian Party (\"Norges Bondelag\") to prevent this group from joining the fascist Nasjonal Samling of Vidkun Quisling.\n\nSeland reached out to a broad audience as the author of over 50 books. Almost all literature written by or about him is only available in Norwegian, reducing a potential international audience. He may not be among Norway’s most known authors, but is certainly among the most celebrated ones within such diverse circles as Norwegian emigrants in America. His fame as a wandering storyteller eventually led him to the States in 1904, where he visited several of the Norwegian immigrant communities which had grown up after the great migration from Norway. In 1925, he represented the Norwegian Farmers' Union at the Norse-American Centennial, the 100th anniversary of Norwegian emigration to America.\n\nHe writes in his autobiography \"Aar og Dagar\" how stunned he was to see how faithfully the Norwegian immigrants had preserved their dialects and the formal church language, and at the same time successfully accommodated to the American way of living. His travels inspired him to write several complimentary articles of the United States and the preservation of Norwegian history, literature, and culture in general among the emigrants living there. His fame led him to meet with President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nSeland chose to write in his native tongue, Nynorsk, at a time when most Norwegian authors still hung on to the Danish-inspired Bokmål. This and the quality of his writings, led him to the friendship with several other combatants of the new language, including such well-known authors as Ivar Aasen, Aasmund Olavsson Vinje, Arne Garborg, Jonas Lie, and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson .\n\nSeland was, above all, a humorist. Many of his books are in a genre that may be called stubs of fun, or in his own words; \"Morostubbar\". They consist of many small humorous stories, the normal ones averaging about 1-2 pages each. These he wrote out of his own imagination, or based them on actual situations experienced on his travels. He traveled all around telling his tales, and was a frequent and popular voice on the radio of his days. Among the Norwegian comedians of the pre-war era, Seland would be counted among the greatest.\n\nAs Norway sought independence from the Kingdom of Sweden, Seland in 1904 gave out his book \"Prinsesse Gullsko og systerne hennar\". As all adults were discussing how to find a peaceful solution to end the union with Sweden, Seland thought of the children. His book was a welcome breath of childish fun and imagination to the lives of thousands, and by using New Norwegian he reached a broader audience as the children finally got to read stories in their own dialect, as New Norwegian were, and still is, spoken by most Norwegians. He published several more books for children, and by 1908 he was involved in creating schoolbooks teaching children how to read in the new language. Illustrations to his books were by the noted artist Theodor Kittelsen among others.\n\n"}

Furthermore, it is assumed that they are two entities.\n\nThe paradox arises because it rests on two incompatible premises—that there can exist simultaneously such things as \"unstoppable forces\" and \"immovable objects\". The \"paradox\" is flawed because if there exists an unstoppable force, it follows logically that there cannot be any such thing as an immovable object and vice versa.\n\nAn example of this paradox in non-western thought can be found in the origin of the Chinese word for contradiction (). This term originates from a story in the 3rd century BC philosophical book \"Han Feizi\". In the story, a man was trying to sell a spear and a shield. When asked how good his spear was, he said that his spear could pierce any shield. Then, when asked how good his shield was, he said that it could defend from all spear attacks. Then one person asked him what would happen if he were to take his spear to strike his shield; the seller could not answer. This led to the idiom of \"\"zìxīang máodùn\"\" (自相矛盾, \"from each-other spear shield\"), or \"self-contradictory\".\n\nAnother ancient example illustrating this theme can be found in the story of the Teumessian fox, who can never be caught, and the hound Laelaps, who never misses what it hunts. Realizing the paradox, Zeus turns both creatures into static stars.\n\nThe problems associated with this paradox can be applied to any other conflict between two abstractly defined extremes that are opposite.\n\nOne of the answers generated by seeming paradoxes like these is that there is no contradiction – that there is a false dilemma. Dr. Christopher Kaczor suggested that the need to change indicates a lack of power rather than the possession thereof, and as such a person who was omniscient would never need to change their mind – not changing the future would be consistent with omniscience rather than contradicting it.\n\nIn Iain Banks's novel, \"Walking on Glass\", a solution to the paradox is given.\n\nThe 2005 video game \"\" retells the story of the spear and shield from \"Han Feizi\" during its fifth case. A \"King of Prosecutors\" trophy that homages the story, depicting a cracked shield and a broken halberd, becomes an important piece of evidence during the case's events.\n\n"}

He started his broadcasting with a 3-year stint at Bailrigg FM, known at that time as University Radio Bailrigg (URB), whilst studying for a BA Hons in Economics at Lancaster University. He was firstly Treasurer and then became President of URB.\n\nAllinson was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He attended Tudor Grange Grammar School for Boys in Solihull. He rejected a career in the legal profession and, in August 1980, took up broadcasting on London's Capital Radio, presenting their Chart Show. He also presented the Early Breakfast show for some of this period. Following on from Capital's Chart Show, in 1984 he took over the late-night 10pmmidnight slot. In 1987 he took over the weekday 24:30pm slot, followed by the weekday Early Breakfast show 46:30am in 1990. In addition to this, in around 1994 he worked alongside Julia Carling on the satellite music television channel VH1, where they hosted a live show together.\n\nAllinson joined BBC Radio 2 in 1997, presenting the MondayThursday late night show from 10:30pm to midnight, which included a mix of music and guests.\n\nIn early 1999, Allinson took over the weekday drivetime show from 5pm to 7pm whilst regular presenter Johnnie Walker was off air due to health-related issues. He presented the programme for several months, with Lynn Parsons taking over the late show; in December 1999, Allinson returned to the late night show.\n\nIn addition to his late night show, in 2000, Allinson also took over a Saturday afternoon show from 3:30 to 6:30pm, where he introduced the 'Radio Wall Of Sound'. This was where listeners could ring in, listen to a selection of snippets of tunes until they liked one particularly, for it to play as quickly as they'd shouted 'play' or made some other noise dictated by the host after the caller had been probed about their life. They were rewarded with a CD album of their choice.\n\nAllinson stepped down from the late night slot in June 2004, so he could concentrate on fronting Radio 2's 'Live & Exclusive' series and 'Sold on Song' projects. With record producer Steve Levine he formed Magnum Opus Broadcasting to \"create programming and content we wanted to hear – but could not find – on the radio. Alongside this, he still continued with his Saturday afternoon show, which was cut down to 2 hours in September 2004 and went out from 4 to 6pm every Saturday.\n\nIt was also during this period that he became the main stand-in for many weekday presenters when taking their holidays, such as Chris Evans, Simon Mayo, Paul O'Grady, Terry Wogan, Ken Bruce, Sarah Kennedy and Steve Wright.\n\nHis Saturday show eventually ended in September 2005, but he still continued to stand in for weekday presenters on Radio 2 as well as create and present documentaries and specialist shows for the network, such as \"The Record Producers\", which is usually broadcast from 7 to 8pm on Bank Holiday Mondays. On Sunday 24 August 2008 Allinson hosted London 2012 Party Live on BBC Radio 2 from The Mall outside Buckingham Palace in London which included the 2008 Beijing Olympics handover musical celebrations.\n\nFrom 8 January 2006 until 24 February 2007, Allinson presented a regular weekly show on BBC Radio Oxford on Sunday mornings from 9am to 12 noon. The show included a mix of music, guests, competitions and a look at headlines from the Sunday papers. Since January 2007, he has presented the two-hour live show \"Allinson's Albums\" between 12 and 2pm every Saturday on BBC Radio Oxford, and from 4 March 2007 is repeated on Sundays from 5 to 7pm (these are no longer broadcast). The show was also broadcast on BBC Radio York on Saturday lunchtimes from 1 to 3pm, and on BBC Radio Cumbria each Wednesday evening, repeated on Sunday afternoons; the last edition of this was broadcast on 6 January 2013.\n\nAllinson has been heard on the various BFBS (British Forces) radio networks since 1980, first on Most Wanted for BFBS Radio 1, where he played mostly new music with a cutting edge, later moving to BFBS UK and others, and moved to BFBS Radio 2 in 2003 presenting in a style which the public have grown accustomed to with his shows on BBC Radio 2. From October 2006 he took over a daily show for the network, going out Mondays-Fridays from 9 to 11am UK time, which he presented until March 2008. Richard has also been known to present shows on the BBC World Service.\n\nFrom 2009, Allinson returned to BBC Radio 2 on a regular basis, presenting the weekend overnight slots, replacing Pete Mitchell and Mo Dutta's slots. The show went out on Friday nights/Saturday mornings and Saturday nights/Sunday mornings from 3 to 6am and was produced by production company Somethin' Else. He also presented an occasional series called \"The Record Producers\", which went out on Bank Holiday Mondays. In October 2014 his weekend show was cancelled due to budget cuts at Radio 2. He hasn't done any cover work for Radio 2 since moving to Magic 105.4.\n\nFrom 27 October 2014, Allinson moved to Magic 105.4 FM to present the weekday drive-time show.\n\n\n"}

Gautam and Pradhan advocated a tactical alliance with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which the CPN (UML) general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal opposed. Moreover, CPN (ML) opposed the Mahakali river treaty with India. CPN (ML) described the split in the following wordings in the manifesto:\n\nCPN (ML) won over the majority of the party membership in the Kathmandu Valley and almost half of the parliamentary group of CPN (UML). From September to December that year, CPN (ML) took part in the government led by G.P. Koirala.\n\nIn the 1999 parliamentary elections CPN (ML) got 6.4% of the votes nationwide, but failed to win a single seat. The division of the communists directly contributed to the electoral victory of the Nepali Congress (which had fewer votes than CPN (ML) and CPN (UML) combined).\n\nIn January 2002 CPN (ML) formed a three-member team to negotiate re-unification with CPN (UML). The team was headed by R.K. Mainali. On February 15, 2002 CPN (ML) reunified with CPN (UML). But C.P. Mainali, an important party leader, refused to go along and reconstituted his own CPN (ML).\n\n"}
{"id": "1839740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839740", "title": "Eternal Lands", "text": "Eternal Lands\n\nEternal Lands (EL) is a free, multiplayer, online role-playing game (MMORPG) created by Radu Privantu in 2002. A pre-alpha version was made public on February 13, 2003. The game client is written in C using OpenGL and SDL.\n\nThe setting is a medieval fantasy world. There are historic elements, such as medieval architecture and weaponry, along with fictional elements such as other humanoid races and magic. It is made of up two main continents on the world of Draia: Seridia and Irilion. Seridia is the first continent, and the place in which new players spawn. It consists of 14 main maps, seven storages, two main PK (player kill) maps, and the only spot to find the Wraith, who can provide various benefits to players in exchange for \"pickpoints\". \n\nPlayers begin play by selecting the race, name and appearance of their character. Skills, abilities and alignments are automatically given initial values. There are six races available: Humans, elves, dwarves, Humans bleus, and elves black. The last three races are pay-to-play races; a player must pay money to play a character of one of these races.\n\n\"Eternal Lands\" does not have fixed character classes, and it is possible for any player to improve any of the 12 skills in the game.\n\nA computer with a 3D-accelerated graphics card and an internet connection is needed to play \"Eternal Lands\".\n\"Eternal Lands\" supports the Microsoft Windows, Android, Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X operating systems and the X86, X86_64, IA64 and PowerPC architectures. An Android version is also available, so the game can be run on almost all Android devices such as smart phones, TV Android boxes, and so on. The software download is free.\n\nIn-game activities include exploring the 39 different outside maps (plus numerous insides and caves), questing, socializing with other players, player killing, and improving skills by fighting, gathering resources and creating items. All skills increase the \"overall\" experience, rewarding players with \"pickpoints\", with which they can further build their characters.\n\nThe productive skills are called \"alchemy\", \"crafting\", \"magic\", \"manufacturing\", \"potion\" making, and \"tailoring\". The items can be created by inserting certain materials into the manufacturing window and attempting to mix them. If mixing fails, the materials may be lost. Success chance is defined by skill level and the item's level. If the player succeeds, the item appears in their inventory and they will receive experience.\n\nHarvesting involves the gathering of resources, such as flowers, minerals and ores. These items can be used for creating items or be sold to NPCs or other players. Harvesting some materials requires different tools.\n\nFighting is broken into \"attack\" and \"defense\" skills, which the player can improve by fighting monsters or players. For every successful hit landed on the opponent, attack experience is gained, and dodging a hit gives defense experience. The amount of experience is determined by the level differences between the fighting players.\n\nIt is also possible to fight with the \"magic\", \"ranging\" and \"summoning\" skills. Ranging experience is obtained by hitting opponent with an arrow or bolt shot with one of the five different bows or crossbows. Summoning experience is obtained by successfully summoning a creature and magic experience by casting spells. Both summons and spells require certain materials that will disappear upon succeeding.\n\nOn the main \"Eternal Lands\" server, there are only a few select areas where players can attack one another, so that players don't have to engage in player versus player combat if they don't want to. However, there is also a pay-to-play PK server which allows for players to fight each other nearly anywhere. It has been out for quite some time now but is still not very populated.\n\nThe game client is open-source under a modified Q Public License and may be developed by anyone. However, the license does require modified clients to be approved by administrators before it is possible to connect with the main servers. For testing purposes, there is a test server. The content is released under a proprietary license which allows redistribution and commercialization only in context of Eternal Lands (and not for other purposes or projects).\n\n"}

It was formed by Chandra Prakash Mainali when the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) reunified with Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). Mainali had refused to go along with the merger and led a faction of the former Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) to reorganize the party.\n\nWhen the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) merged with the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) on 15 February 2002, Chandra Prakash Mainali along with other dissident members reorganized the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist). Mainali originally planned to continue the party under his leadership but had to reorganize the party after the former party notified the Election Commission of Nepal of their dissolution and dissolved all central level organization of the party.\n\nCPN (ML) was a member of the United Left Front and participated in the 2006 Loktantra Andolan. The party suffered a leadership crisis when a dissident faction of the party led by Rishi Ram Kattel expelled party leader C.P. Mainali, accusing him of being a pro-royalist. The faction led by C.P. Mainali on the other hand expelled Rishi Ram Kattel and other dissident members. The faction led by Rishi Ram Kattel eventually merged with the Ram Singh Shrestha faction of Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre–Masal) and the Sitaram Tamang faction of Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist–Leninist–Maoist Centre) to form the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified).\n\nAhead of the 2008 Constituent Assembly election, the party presented a closed proportional representation list with 168 candidates, headed by C.P. Mainali. The party presented 116 candidates for first past the post seats. It won eight seats in the election, all of them through proportional representation, with about 1.33% of the vote. The party also had one member nominated to the Constituent Assembly.\n\nOn 6 August 2010, CPN (ML) suffered a split regarding supporting Pusha Kamal Dahal in the prime minister election. The split was led by former minister Jagat Bahadur Bogati and included four CA members. The new party was named Communist Party of Nepal Marxist-Leninist (Socialist).\n\nIn the 2013 Constituent Assembly election, the party won five seats under proportional representation. The party joined the cabinet under Khadga Prasad Oli on 5 November 2015. Chandra Prakash Mainali was made deputy prime minister and Minister for Women, Children and Social Welfare.\n\nIn the 2017 local elections, CPN (ML) only won four seats in local governments. The party also contested the 2017 legislative and provincial elections but failed to get any seats.\n\n\n\n"}
