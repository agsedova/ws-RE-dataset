{"id": "1937376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937376", "title": "Lucky (Britney Spears song)", "text": "Lucky (Britney Spears song)\n\n\"Lucky\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears. It was released on August 8, 2000 by Jive Records as the second single from her second studio album \"Oops!... I Did It Again\". After meeting with producers Max Martin and Rami Yacoub in Sweden, the singer recorded several songs for the album, including \"Lucky\". The song tells a story about a famous movie star named Lucky, who, despite seemingly having it all – fame, wealth, beauty – is truly lonely and unhappy on the inside. It was praised by music critics, who considered its melody and rhythm as sweet and catchy, and noted the lyrics to be about Spears herself.\n\n\"Lucky\" achieved commercial success worldwide, peaking at number 1 in Austria, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, while reaching the top 10 in several European countries. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number 5, and is Spears' tenth best-selling single in the country, having sold over 225,000 copies there. It also peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard Hot 100\" in the United States. An accompanying music video was directed by Dave Meyers, and portrays Spears as herself and a melancholy movie star Lucky, who just wants to have some fun in life. Spears has performed \"Lucky\" in a number of live appearances and in two of her concert tours.\n\nIn 1999, Spears began work on her second studio album \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" (2000), in Sweden and Switzerland. After meeting with Max Martin and Rami Yacoub in Sweden, Spears recorded several songs for the album, including \"Lucky\", which was co-written and co-produced by Martin and Rami, with additional co-writing from Alexander Kronlund. Upon returning to the United States, the singer revealed in an interview with MTV News that: \"I just got back from Sweden, and did half [of] the material [for \"Oops!\"] over there. I was really, really happy with the material, but we had [such] limited time to get so much done. So I've just really been in the studio nonstop, which is cool, though.\" Spears recorded her vocals for the song, the first week of November 1999 at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. \"Lucky\" was released on August 8, 2000 as the second single from the album.\n\n\"Lucky\" is a song that lasts for three minutes and 24 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of D major (but will later modulate to E major at the end of the bridge) and is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 95 beats per minute, while Spears' vocal range spans over an octave, from A to E. \"Lucky\" has a basic sequence of D–Bm–G–A as its chord progression. David Veitch of the \"Calgary Sun\" and Chuck Taylor of \"Billboard\" compared the song's rhythm to the ones of Spears' previous singles \"...Baby One More Time\" (1998) and \"Sometimes\" (1999). Lyrically, Spears tells \"a story about a girl named Lucky,\" who is a famous pop star that, despite having all that she wants, still feels lonely inside. Veitch also commented that the lyrics actually refer to Spears' life.\n\n\"Lucky\" received general acclaim from music critics. A review by the \"NME\" staff said that \"Lucky\" is \"perhaps Britney's finest moment. The ultimate mallrat, bittersweet teenage symphony\". They considered the song Spears' version of \"Where Did It All Go Wrong?\" by English rock band Oasis, and went to describe it as \"a heart-rending tale of life at the top of the teen pop tree, transformed into an anthem for dramatic, moody 12-year-old girls everywhere by Max Martin's scary talent for teenybop lyrics\". However, it was noted that some of the lyrics \"sounds pretty heavy when you've just been dumped and Britney's Mickey Mouse Club-trained falsetto is reaching its peak\". David Veitch of \"Calgary Sun\" called \"Lucky\" a \"sweetly melodic mid-tempo song\" and regarding the lyrics commented, \"We feel her pain\", \"Billboard\" magazine contributor Chuck Taylor praised \"Lucky\" and featured the song on the Spolight column of his Singles Review section. Taylor stated that: \"its contagious melody, bang-in-your-brain hook, the empathetic theme of a girl who's the world biggest superstar and yet feels all alone (hmm...) will make it an easy sell to top 40 radio and to her grand legion of dedicated fans\".\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" called it \"one of her most bubbly tunes, but the lyrics about a miserable starlet suggest that she identified with the dark side of fame very early on in her career\". \"Gay Times\" Daniel Megarry felt that \"the bittersweet 'Lucky', which almost feels autobiographical, remains the ultimate throwback for 90s kids\". The staff from \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed it at number 10 on their ranking of Spears's songs and said that \"given everything we know about Spears’ past decade, it’s hard not to hear 'Lucky' as a haunting premonition packaged in fairy dust\". Erin Strecker, from \"Billboard\", called it \"one of the pop princess' great ballads\", and \"undoubtedly one of the high points of Britney Spears' career\". Writing for \"Pink News\", Mayer Nissim called it a \"a ‘60s-infused self-reflective bit of pop\", but pointed out that \"there’s a real sense of genuine emotion Spears gets across with some neat vocal flourishes\". For Christopher Rosa from \"Glamour\", it's Spears' fifth best song, as well as a \"perfect blend of the sweet-pop sound from her first record and lyrics that feel just a little more grown-up\". \"Bustle\"s Alex Kristelis said that the song's \"bubblegum pop gloss disguises even its most devastating lyrics\".\n\nIn the United States \"Lucky\" peaked at number 23 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number nine on the Top 40 Mainstream chart. It also peaked at number 39 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales component chart, and number 14 on Rhythmic Top 40. \"Lucky\" also achieved commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Austria, Europe, Sweden and Switzerland, while reaching the top ten in several European countries. On the week of August 28, 2000 \"Lucky\" debuted at number 5 in the Official Charts Company from the United Kingdom, falling to number six in the following week. According to the Official Charts Company, it is her tenth best-selling single in the country, having sold over 225,000 copies there. In Australia, the song peaked at number three, and was later certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for shipments of more than 70,000 units of the single. In Germany, the song reached number one on the Media Control Charts, being certified Gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) for shipping over 250,000 units of the single.\n\nJive Records commissioned a music video for \"Lucky\" to be directed by Dave Meyers. It was shot on June 12 and 13, 2000 at the Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, California. According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, Spears portrays \"a melancholy movie star who wants nothing more than to have a little fun\".\n\nThe video begins with Spears telling a story about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, standing on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells \"Cut! We've got it\". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: \"Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!\" She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.\n\nA \"Billboard\" staff reviewer noted that the story \"turned out to be less than pure fiction when the singer later went through personal problems in the very public eye.\" Jarett Wieselman of the \"New York Post\" rated the video a C+ and stated that: \"Britney's first Hollywood cautionary tale video didn't seem quite as telling at the time, but with a little distance, the lyrics and concept seem so much sadder\". A writer of \"Rolling Stone\" said that \"Lucky\" is best known for \"being the first Spears video to focus on what would become a recurring theme: her conflicted relationship to fame\".\n\nSpears performed \"Lucky\" for the first time during her Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour in Columbia, U.S.A at June 20, 2000. The performance of the song featured a navy theme. The track was also on the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001–02), where Spears emerged from the middle of a giant musical box on the stage as a ballerina, to perform the song in a medley with \"Born to Make You Happy\" and \"Sometimes\", right after the performance of \"Overprotected\". Spears also performed the song on several television appearances, including at the \"Top of the Pops Germany\" in 2000, and at \"The Today Show\". \"Lucky\" was included on the setlist of the , Spears' Las Vegas residency show (2013 - 2016).\n\nCountry singer Taylor Swift performed the song on her Speak Now World Tour on September 20, 2011 located in Louisiana, as a tribute to Spears. Wearing her signature lilac dress, Swift started to play the first chords of \"Lucky\" on her guitar, while singing, \"Early morning/She wakes up/With a knock, knock, knock on the door/It's time for makeup/Perfect smile/It's you they're all waiting for.\" Scott Shetler of Pop Crush said that \"the crowd energy for the Britney cover didn't seem as high as when Swift covered Eminem in Detroit or Justin Bieber in Toronto.\" Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV, however, praised the performance, and noted that the show's crowd gave a positive reaction to the cover, saying, \"though the video is sideways and features the amateur videographer's own personal sing-along, the excitement in her voice is a testament to Taylor's song choice. Or in other words, we can almost guarantee that every normal, living, breathing Louisiana-bred girl in attendance at Taylor's show is also obsessed with Britney Spears.\" Becky Bain of Idolator said that she had no doubts that Swift would cover a Spears song, but was surprised that the song Swift chose was \"Lucky\". PopDust writer Katherine St Asaph said that \"Lucky\" is \"one of the few Britney lyrics that could just as easily be written for/by Taylor and one of the few songs that wouldn’t need massive re-arranging.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:\n"}

{"id": "1937387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937387", "title": "Terra Prime", "text": "Terra Prime\n\n\"Terra Prime\" is the 21st episode of the of the American science fiction television series \"\", and originally aired on May 13, 2005. The story was developed by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, along with André Bormanis, and developed into a script by the Reeves-Stevenses and show runner Manny Coto. The episode is the second of a two-part story, which started in \"\". The episode was directed by Marvin Rush, his second for the series.\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. In this episode, John Frederick Paxton, the leader of the xenophobic human group Terra Prime, threatens to use an array on Mars to destroy Starfleet Command, unless all aliens leave Earth immediately. \"Enterprise\", Captain Archer and an away team covertly take a shuttlepod to the array and attempt to stop Paxton and rescue their crew-mates.\n\nThe guest actors who appeared in \"Demons\" were joined by Derek Magyar and Eric Pierpoint, who appeared earlier in the season in \"\", while Joel Swetow had previously appeared in episodes of \"\" and \"\". The script called for a reference to the United States space program and so the Carl Sagan Memorial Station and the Mars Exploration Rover \"Sojourner\" were included in a shot added in post production. \"Terra Prime\" received a Nielsen rating of 2.0/4% and it was praised by critics who described it as a \"real\" episode and there were suggestions that had \"Enterprise\" gone into a further season then the story could have acted as an ongoing subplot. It was ranked as the best episode of the series by \"Empire\" magazine.\n\nCommanders T'Pol and Tucker remain captives of Paxton, who continues to broadcast his demand on all channels and frequencies. Paxton's action has an unsettling effect on the interspecies conference since it is clear that not all humans support it. On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker to see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself). Seeking to fine-tune their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol in order to force Tucker to optimize the targeting system of the array.\n\n\"Enterprise\" is then ordered to Mars to destroy the array, but is turned away when a warning shot from the weapon damages the ship. Gannet Brooks, now in the brig, reveals to Ensign Mayweather she is a Starfleet Intelligence operative, and that Terra Prime probably has an operative aboard. Under the urging of Minister Samuels, the crew of \"Enterprise\" conceive a way to approach the deadly station undetected, using a shuttlepod hidden inside the tail of a comet. Captain Archer elects to lead the away mission, along with Lieutenant Reed, Doctor Phlox, and Mayweather.\n\nEn route, the shuttle's systems suddenly fail, nearly causing it to crash. Landing on Mars, the team then infiltrate Paxton's ship. Teaming up with Tucker, who has escaped his cell, they battle the Terra Prime followers in the control room. During the shootout, Paxton manages to lock the firing sequence — fortunately, Tucker has altered the targeting, and the beam misses. With Paxton under arrest, the hybrid child, named Elizabeth after Tucker's sister, is brought to Phlox, who unfortunately cannot do anything to save her. Investigations also reveal that Ensign Masaro was the spy, and he dies by his own hand. Back at Starfleet, Archer makes an impassioned speech to convince the delegates to explore the universe's mysteries together.\n\nJudith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens created the story with André Bormanis and developed it into a script with show runner Manny Coto. Because of the nature of the two-part episode, revisions to the scripts for both \"Demons\" and \"Terra Prime\" were required as changes occurred in the other script. The Reeves-Stevens felt that a \"ticking clock\" was required for \"Terra Prime\", and so the 24-hour deadline set by Paxton's group was written into the end of \"Demons\". However, that exact ending was changed on several occasions which resulted in modifications to the \"Terra Prime\" script. Other changes were made following the filming of \"Demons\" as the Reeves-Stevenses changed some of the dialogue for Paxton after seeing Peter Weller's performance. Shran, played by Jeffrey Combs, was written out of the episode as the decision was made to have the character appear in the series finale instead.\n\nFilming began on \"Terra Prime\" on the afternoon of February 15, 2005 and continued until February 25. It was the second episode to be directed by Marvin Rush, who had previously worked on the second part of \"In a Mirror, Darkly\". Rush was normally the director of photography on \"Enterprise\". Whilst the majority of sets created for the Martian array had been created for the previous episode, a set was created to appear as an access tube specially for use in \"Terra Prime\". In order to represent the shuttlecraft entering the comet, rather than using camera movement, the set was placed on rollers and physically moved to appear turbulent. The Martian landscape was inserted using a green screen where the away team enter the array, and the actors had make-up applied to represent the red dust of the Martian landscape.\n\nSeveral guest stars who had appeared in \"Demons\" continued in their roles in \"Terra Prime\"; Harry Groener, Peter Mensah, Adam Clark along with Weller and Watts. A reference to Weller's former show \"Odyssey 5\" is included in the episode, when his character is diagnosed with \"Taggart's Syndrome\", where Taggart was the name of his character on \"Odyssey 5\". They were joined in this episode by several actors playing recurring roles, including Gary Graham who had played Ambassador Soval since the series pilot and Derek Magyar and Eric Pierpoint, who had played Commander Kelby and Harris respectively earlier in the season in \"\". Joel Swetow also appeared in \"Terra Prime\" as an Andorian Ambassador, who had previously appeared in the of \"\" and \"\" episode \"\" as well as performing voice roles for several \"Star Trek\" video games. The baby in the episode was played by a pair of twins, whilst the pointed Vulcan ears were applied to the child in post production.\n\nThe script requested two post production shots to be added as references to the American space program, which would have been shown as the shuttlepod landed on Mars. These included the Mars Exploration Rover \"Sojourner\" which appeared in the opening titles of \"Enterprise\", now lying dormant and covered in dust. A further shot showed a plaque which denoted the landing spot of the rover on board the Carl Sagan Memorial Station. Following the cancellation of the series two episodes earlier, Coto stated that he considered \"Demons\" and \"Terra Prime\" to be the actual finale of the \"Enterprise\" storyline, rather than the final aired episode \"These Are the Voyages... which would be a goodbye to the franchise.\"\n\n\"Terra Prime\" was first aired in the United States on UPN on May 13, 2005. The broadcast saw the episode come in fifth place during the timeslot, with a Nielsen rating of 2.0/4. This means that it was seen by 2 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It gained higher ratings than The WB, which aired re-runs of \"What I Like About You\" and \"Reba\", but was behind the other four major networks with a CBS special on Elvis Presley receiving ratings of 7.8/14. This was the same ratings received by \"Demons\", but was less than the final episode, \"These Are the Voyages...\" which received ratings of 2.4/4 when it was aired immediately after \"Terra Prime\".\n\nMichelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation, saying that it felt like a \"real \"Star Trek\" episode\" but wasn't sure about the characterisation for T'Pol seen in \"Terra Prime\". She would have preferred to see more of Mars, but was pleased with the glimpse of the Carl Sagan Memorial Station. She summed it up by saying that the two episodes were \"no means perfect episodes, but they're reaching very earnestly for what Star Trek was in the beginning\". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website \"Jammer's Reviews\" said that while there were plot holes in the story, and that elements were clumsy such as the showdown towards the end, the overall story was \"sound\". He said that the episode was a \"much more satisfying as a send-off for the Enterprise crew\" than \"These Are the Voyages...\". He gave \"Terra Prime\" a score of three out of four.\n\nThe review from IGN said that \"In a perfect world, Enterprise would have gotten another year and could have used Terra Prime as a running subplot.\" While they thought that the message was heavy-handed, it was the type of story that \"Enterprise\" should have been covering all along. They gave \"Demons\" and \"Terra Prime\" a score of four out of five. Jay Garmon, whilst compiling a list of the best episodes of \"Enterprise\", listed \"Demons\" and \"Terra Prime\" as the third best. He thought that Peter Weller \"stole the show\", and that it created a \"solid conclusion\" to the show despite the following episode, \"These Are the Voyages...\". \"Empire\" magazine ranked \"Terra Prime\" as the best episode of the series. In a 2015 interview with some of the show's cast with SyFy, this episode was a recommended favorite of theirs and they suggested that the combination of \"Demons\" and \"Terra Prime\" as an alternate finale for Enterprise.\n\n\"Terra Prime\" was released on home media in the United States on November 1, 2005, as part of the season four DVD box set of \"Enterprise\". The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.\n\n"}

{"id": "1937408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937408", "title": "Watchmaker analogy", "text": "Watchmaker analogy\n\nThe watchmaker analogy or watchmaker argument is a teleological argument which states, by way of an analogy, that a design implies a designer. The analogy has played a prominent role in natural theology and the \"argument from design,\" where it was used to support arguments for the existence of God and for the intelligent design of the universe, in both Christianity and Deism.\n\nSir Isaac Newton, among other leaders in the scientific revolution, including René Descartes, upheld \"that the physical laws he had uncovered revealed the mechanical perfection of the workings of the universe to be akin to a watch, wherein the watchmaker is God.\"\n\nThe 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection put forward an explanation for complexity and adaptation, which reflects scientific consensus on the origins of biological diversity. This provides a counter-argument to the watchmaker analogy: for example, the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins referred to the analogy in his 1986 book \"The Blind Watchmaker\" giving his explanation of evolution. Others, however, consider the watchmaker analogy to be compatible with evolutionary creation, opining that the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. In the 19th century, deists, who championed the watchmaker analogy, held that Darwin's theory fit with \"the principle of uniformitarianism—the idea that all processes in the world occur now as they have in the past\" and that deistic evolution \"provided an explanatory framework for understanding species variation in a mechanical universe.\"\n\nIn the United States, starting in the 1960s, creationists revived versions of the argument to dispute the concepts of evolution and natural selection, and there was renewed interest in the watchmaker argument. The most famous statement of this teleological argument using the watchmaker analogy was given by William Paley in his 1802 book \"Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity\".\n\nThe scientific revolution \"nurtured a growing awareness\" that \"there were universal laws of nature at work that ordered the movement of the world and its parts.\" James K. A. Smith and Amos Yong write that in \"astronomy, the Copernican revolution regarding the heliocentrism of the solar system, Johannes Kepler's (1571–1630) three laws of planetary motion, and Isaac Newton's (1642–1727) law of universal gravitation—laws of gravitation and of motion, and notions of absolute space and time—all combined to establish the regularities of heavenly and earthly bodies.\" With such a backdrop, \"deists suggested the watchmaker analogy: just as watches are set in motion by watchmakers, after which they operate according to their pre-established mechanisms, so also was the world begun by the God as creator, after which it and all its parts have operated according to their pre-established natural laws. With these laws perfectly in place, events have unfolded according to the prescribed plan.\" For Sir Isaac Newton, \"the regular motion of the planets made it reasonable to believe in the continued existence of God.\" Newton also upheld the idea that \"like a watchmaker, God was forced to intervene in the universe and tinker with the mechanism from time to time to ensure that it continued operating in good working order.\" Like Newton, René Descartes viewed \"the cosmos as a great time machine operating according to fixed laws, a watch created and wound up by the great watchmaker.\"\n\nWatches and timepieces have been used as examples of complicated technology in philosophical discussions. For example, Cicero, Voltaire and René Descartes all used timepieces in arguments regarding purpose. The watchmaker analogy, as described here, was used by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle in 1686, but was most famously formulated by Paley.\n\nPaley used the watchmaker analogy in his book \"Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature\", published in 1802. In it, Paley wrote that if a pocket watch is found on a heath, it is most reasonable to assume that someone dropped it and that it was made by at least one watchmaker, not by natural forces:\n\nPaley went on to argue that the complex structures of living things and the remarkable adaptations of plants and animals required an intelligent designer. He believed the natural world was the creation of God and showed the nature of the creator. According to Paley, God had carefully designed \"even the most humble and insignificant organisms\" and all of their minute features (such as the wings and antennae of earwigs). He believed, therefore, that God must care even more for humanity.\n\nPaley recognised that there is great suffering in nature and nature appears to be indifferent to pain. His way of reconciling that with his belief in a benevolent God was to assume that life had more pleasure than pain.\"\n\nAs a side note, a charge of wholesale plagiarism from this book was brought against Paley in \"The Athenaeum\" for 1848, but the famous illustration of the watch was not peculiar to Nieuwentyt and had been used by many others before either Paley or Nieuwentyt. But the charge of plagiarism was based on more similarities. For example, Niewentyt wrote \"in the middle of a Sandy down, or in a desart {sic} and solitary Place, where few People are used to pass, any one should find a Watch ...\" \n\nWilliam Paley taught the works of Joseph Butler and appears to have built on Butler's 1736 design arguments of inferring a designer from evidence of design. Butler noted: \n\"As the manifold Appearances of Design and of final Causes, in the Constitution of the World, prove it to be the Work of an intelligent Mind ... The appearances of \"Design\" and of \"final Causes\" in the constitution of nature as really prove this acting agent to be an \"intelligent Designer\"... ten thousand Instances of Design, cannot but prove a Designer.\".\n\nRousseau also mentioned the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, Emile: I am like a man who sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though he does not know the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. I do not know what this is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? \n\nBefore Paley published his book, David Hume (1711-1776) had already put forward a number of philosophical criticisms of the watch analogy, and to some extent anticipated the concept of natural selection. His criticisms can be separated into three major distinctions:\n\nHis first objection is that we have no experience of world-making. Hume highlighted the fact that everything we claim to know the cause of, we have derived the inductions from previous experiences of similar objects being created or seen the object itself being created ourselves. For example, with a watch, we know it has to be created by a watch-maker because we can observe it being made and compare it to the making of other similar watches or objects to deduce they have alike causes in their creation. However, he argues that we have no experience of the universe's creation or any other universe's creations to compare our own universe to and never will; therefore, it would be illogical to infer that our universe has been created by an intelligent designer in the same way that a watch has.\n\nThe second criticism that Hume offers is about the form of the argument as an analogy in itself. An analogical argument claims that because object X (a watch) is like object Y (the universe) in one respect, both are therefore probably alike in another, hidden, respect (their cause, having to be created by an intelligent designer). He points out that for an argument from analogy to be successful, the two things that are being compared have to have an adequate number of similarities that are relevant to the respect that are analogised. For example, a kitten and a lion may be very similar in many respects, but just because a lion makes a \"roar\", it would not be correct to infer a kitten also \"roars\": the similarities between the two objects being not enough and the degree of relevance to what sound they make being not relevant enough. Hume then argues that the universe and a watch also do not have enough relevant or close similarities to infer that they were both created the same way. For example, the universe is made of organic natural material, but the watch is made of artificial mechanic materials. He claims that in the same respect, the universe could be argued to be more analogous to something more organic such as a vegetable (which we can observe for ourselves does not need a 'designer' or a 'watchmaker' to be created). Although he admits the analogy of a universe to a vegetable to seem ridiculous, he says that it is just as ridiculous to analogize the universe with a watch.\n\nThe third criticism that Hume offers is that even if the argument did give evidence for a designer; it still gives no evidence for the traditional 'omnipotent', 'benevolent' (all-powerful and all-loving) God of traditional Christian theism. One of the main assumptions of Paley's argument is that 'like effects have like causes'; or that machines (like the watch) and the universe have similar features of design and so both also have the same cause of their existence: they must both have an intelligent designer. However, Hume points out that what Paley does not comprehend is to what extent 'like causes' extend: how similar the creation of a universe is to the creation of a watch. Instead, Paley moves straight to the conclusion that this designer of the universe is the 'God' he believes in of traditional Christianity. Hume, however takes the idea of 'like causes' and points out some potential absurdities in how far the 'likeness' of these causes could extend to if the argument were taken further as to explain this. One example that he uses is how a machine or a watch is usually designed by a whole team of people rather than just one person. Surely, if we are analogizing the two in this way, it would point to there being a group of gods who created the universe, not just a single being. Another example he uses is that complex machines are usually the result of many years of trial and error with every new machine being an improved version of the last. Also by analogy of the two, would that not hint that the universe could also have been just one of many of God's 'trials' and that there are much better universes out there? However, if that were taken to be true, surely the 'creator' of it all would not be 'all loving' and 'all powerful' if they had to carry out the process of 'trial and error' when creating the universe?\n\nHume also points out there is still a possibility that the universe could have been created by random chance but still show evidence of design as the universe is eternal and would have an infinite amount of time to be able to form a universe so complex and ordered as our own. He called that the 'Epicurean hypothesis'. It argued that when the universe was first created, the universe was random and chaotic, but if the universe is eternal, over an unlimited period of time, natural forces could have naturally 'evolved' by random particles coming together over time into the incredibly ordered system we can observe today without the need of an intelligent designer as an explanation.\n\nThe last objection that he makes draws on the widely discussed problem of evil. He argues that all the daily unnecessary suffering that goes on everywhere within the world is yet another factor that pulls away from the idea that God is an 'omnipotent' 'benevolent' being.\n\nCharles Darwin's theory provided another explanation.\n\nWhen Darwin completed his studies of theology at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1831, he read Paley's \"Natural Theology\" and believed that the work gave rational proof of the existence of God. That was because living beings showed complexity and were exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world.\n\nSubsequently, on the voyage of the \"Beagle\", Darwin found that nature was not so beneficent, and the distribution of species did not support ideas of divine creation. In 1838, shortly after his return, Darwin conceived his theory that natural selection, rather than divine design, was the best explanation for gradual change in populations over many generations. He published the theory in \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, and in later editions, he noted responses that he had received:\n\nDarwin reviewed the implications of this finding in his autobiography:\nThe idea that nature was governed by laws was already common, and in 1833, William Whewell as a proponent of the natural theology that Paley had inspired had written that \"with regard to the material world, we can at least go so far as this—we can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each particular case, but by the establishment of general laws.\" Darwin, who spoke of the \"fixed laws\" concurred with Whewell, writing in his second edition of \"On The Origin of Species\":\n\nBy the time that Darwin published his theory, theologians of liberal Christianity were already supporting such ideas, and by the late 19th century, their modernist approach was predominant in theology. In science, evolution theory incorporating Darwin's natural selection became completely accepted.\n\nIn \"The Blind Watchmaker\", Richard Dawkins argues that the watch analogy conflates the complexity that arises from living organisms that are able to reproduce themselves (and may become more complex over time) with the complexity of inanimate objects, unable to pass on any reproductive changes (such as the multitude of parts manufactured in a watch). The comparison breaks down because of this important distinction.\n\nIn a \"BBC Horizon\" episode, also entitled \"The Blind Watchmaker\", Dawkins described Paley's argument as being \"as mistaken as it is elegant\". In both contexts, he saw Paley as having made an incorrect proposal as to a certain problem's solution, but Dawkins did not disrespect him. In his essay \"The Big Bang\", Steven Pinker discusses Dawkins's coverage of Paley's argument, adding: \"Biologists today do not disagree with Paley's laying out of the problem. They disagree only with his solution.\"\n\nIn his book \"The God Delusion\", Dawkins argues that life was the result of complex biological processes. He makes the argument that the comparison to the lucky construction of a watch is fallacious because proponents of evolution do not consider evolution \"lucky\". Rather than luck, the evolution of human life is the result of billions of years of natural selection. He concludes that evolution is a fair contestant to replace God in the role of watchmaker.\n\nIn addition, he argues that the watchmaker's creation of the watch implies that the watchmaker must be more complex than the watch.\nDesign is top-down, someone or something more complex designs something less complex.\nTo follow the line upwards demands that the watch was designed by a (necessarily more complex) watchmaker, the watchmaker must have been created by a more complex being than himself. So the question becomes who designed the designer? \nDawkins argues that (a) this line continues ad infinitum, and (b) it does not explain anything.\n\nEvolution, on the other hand, takes a bottom-up approach; it explains how more complexity can arise gradually by building on or combining lesser complexity.\n\nIn response to such claims, Nathan Schneider writes, \"Paley died decades before \"The Origin of Species\" was published, and ever since his views have been so repeatedly set in opposition to Darwin's that Richard Dawkins titled one of his books on evolution \"The Blind Watchmaker\". A closer look at Paley's own thinking reveals, however, a God who works through the laws of nature, not beyond them like the modern ID theorists' designer. Paley had no objection to species changing over time. It's only in today's highly polarized culture-war climate that we don't bother to notice that one of the forefathers of intelligent design theory might have been perfectly comfortable with evolution.\"\n\nBiologist Peter Richerson and anthropologist Robert Boyd offer an oblique criticism by arguing that watches were not \"hopeful monsters created by single inventors,\" but were created by watchmakers building up their skills in a cumulative fashion over time, each contributing to a watch-making tradition from which any individual watchmaker draws their designs.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the modernist theology of higher criticism was contested in the United States by Biblical literalists, who campaigned successfully against the teaching of evolution and began calling themselves creationists in the 1920s. When teaching of evolution was reintroduced into public schools in the 1960s, they adopted what they called \"creation science\" that had a central concept of design in similar terms to Paley's argument. That idea was then relabeled \"intelligent design\", which presents the same analogy as an argument against evolution by natural selection without explicitly stating that the \"intelligent designer\" was God. The argument from the complexity of biological organisms was now presented as the \"irreducible complexity\" argument, the most notable proponent of which was Michael Behe, and, leveraging off the verbiage of information theory, the \"specified complexity\" argument, the most notable proponent of which was William Dembski.\n\nThe watchmaker analogy was referenced in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial. Throughout the trial, Paley was mentioned several times. The defense's expert witness John Haught noted that both Intelligent Design and the watchmaker analogy are \"reformulations\" of the same theological argument.\nOn day 21 of the trial, Mr. Harvey walked Dr. Minnich through a modernized version of Paley's argument, substituting a cell phone for the watch.\nIn his ruling, the judge stated that the use of the argument from design by intelligent design proponents \"is merely a restatement of the Reverend William Paley's argument applied at the cell level,\" adding \"Minnich, Behe, and Paley reach the same conclusion, that complex organisms must have been designed using the same reasoning, except that Professors Behe and Minnich refuse to identify the designer, whereas Paley inferred from the presence of design that it was God.\" The judge ruled that such an inductive argument is not accepted as science because it is unfalsifiable.\n\n\n\n"}

It was both directed and produced by Stanley Donen and based on the 1943 classic children-adult's novella, \"The Little Prince\" (\"Le Petit Prince\"), by the writer, poet and aviator Count Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, who disappeared near the end of the Second World War some 15 months after his fable was first published.\n\nThe film and its music were unsuccessful at the box office but became somewhat popular after its theatrical run, and has been released for sale on various media.\n\nThe original \"Little Prince\" was first published in 1943, and is the most famous work of the French aristocrat, writer, poet and pioneering aviator Count Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (1900–1944). It is a poetic tale self-illustrated in watercolours in which a pilot stranded in the desert meets a young prince fallen to Earth from a tiny asteroid. The story is philosophical and includes societal criticism, remarking on the strangeness of the adult world.\n\nThough ostensibly a children's book, \"The Little Prince\" makes several profound and idealistic observations about life and human nature. For example, Saint-Exupéry tells of a fox meeting the young prince during his travels on Earth. The story's essence is contained in the lines uttered by the fox to the little prince: \"On ne voit bien qu'avec le cœur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.\" (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye.\") Other key thematic messages are articulated by The Fox, such as: \"You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed\" and \"It is the time you have devoted to your rose that makes your rose so important.\" The Fox's messages are arguably the most famous because of their nature of dealing with relationships.\n\nAntoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote and illustrated \"The Little Prince\" in New York City and Asharoken, N.Y. in mid-to-late 1942 while exiled in the United States after the Fall of France, with the manuscript being completed in October. It would be first published in early 1943 in both English and French, but only in the U.S. It would later appear in his native homeland of France posthumously, after the liberation of Paris, as all of Saint-Exupéry's works had been banned in Nazi-occupied France. Since first being published the novella has been adapted to various media over the decades, including audio recordings, stage, ballet, and operatic works.\n\nThe fantasy-musical film adaptation of \"The Little Prince\" was directed and produced by Stanley Donen, and stars Steven Warner in the title role, with Richard Kiley as the aviator, titled as The Pilot. Additional cast members included Bob Fosse as The Snake, Gene Wilder as The Fox, Donna McKechnie as the petulant, vain Rose, Joss Ackland as The King, and Victor Spinetti as The Historian. The film's desert sequences were shot on location in Tunisia. In real life, The Fox's character is believed to be based on one of Saint-Exupéry's lovers, Sylvia Hamilton Reinhardt, with The Rose being attributed to the author's wife, the Countess Consuelo de Saint Exupéry.\n\nThe production was Lerner and Loewe's final musical. The music's creative team were dissatisfied with the film's Hollywood treatment, with Loewe refusing to visit London to supervise the arrangement and recording of the score.\n\nBased in the 1943 classic book of the same name by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the fable tells the story of an aviator (played by Richard Kiley) forced to make an emergency landing in the Sahara Desert. There he is befriended by a young boy, the Little Prince, who had descended to Earth from Asteroid B-612. In the days that follow, The Pilot hears about his past and various journeys throughout the solar system.\n\nAs he travels through space, the Little Prince encounters several strange grown-ups on different planetoids, all with a skewed or curious way of looking at life. But it is not until he finally reaches Earth, that the Little Prince learns his most important life lessons of all, mainly from The Fox (Gene Wilder), and The Snake (Bob Fosse). Before the Little Prince dies, he shares those lessons with The Pilot. Although The Pilot tries to keep the Little Prince alive, the boy disappears in the morning and The Pilot searches for him in the desert but gives up after realizing that the Little Prince never existed. Soon The Pilot is able to start his plane and flies away but hears the laughter of the Little Prince in the starry night; he believes the boy has returned to space.\n\n\nRichard Burton was actively pursued for the role of The Pilot. Burton had had a huge success on Broadway with Lerner and Loewe's musical production \"Camelot\", but turned down the role in \"The Little Prince\".\n\n\nThe film was shot on location in Tunisia.\n\nIn 1973, Lerner and Loewe recorded the score at the Palm Springs Desert Museum, with Lerner on vocals and Loewe at the piano. It included \"Matters of Consequence\", which was cut from the film. It is one of only a few existing recordings of the duo performing together.\n\nThe film had production design by John Barry (not to be confused with composer John Barry, who later composed a musical adaptation of \"The Little Prince\" for Broadway).\n\nA soundtrack album was released by ABC Records. It is now available in CD format on the Decca Records label.\n\nThe film opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on November 7, 1974 in a show including \"The Nativity\", The Rockettes and the Will Irwin Orchestra and grossed $215,000 in its opening week.\n\nBob Fosse appears in the film as The Snake for one song, \"A Snake in the Grass\", during which he does a dance sequence that he choreographed, which includes trademark Fosse elements such as hip thrusts, jazz hands and use of hat and jacket as props. This scene in the film has been speculated to have been a major influence on singer Michael Jackson's costume and choreography for performances of his 1982 hit song \"Billie Jean\". Fosse's dance sequence even included a variation on the moonwalk, a dance step that Jackson included in his \"Billie Jean\" performances that later became his signature move.\n\n\n Citations \n\n\n"}

The head office is located in Mississauga, Ontario (serving metro Toronto) with seven other Ontario offices in Ottawa, Kingston, Pembroke, Barrie, London, Niagara Falls/St. Catharines and Windsor.\n\nThe Eastern Region has five offices, located in St. John's, Halifax, Moncton, Quebec City, and Montreal. The Prairie Region consists of six offices located in Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon, Lethbridge, Calgary and Edmonton. The Pacific Region has five offices in Burnaby (serving metro Vancouver), Kelowna, Nanaimo, Prince George and Victoria.\n\nIn November 1967, the Jim Pattison Group entered the outdoor advertising industry with the acquisition of Seaboard Advertising. Seaboard was founded in 1908 as Bond & Ricketts Ltd. and was one of Canada's first outdoor advertising companies. The company name changed to Ruddy-Duker, and in 1936 it was sold to Neon Products. By 1946 the outdoor advertising portion of Neon Products business was a subsidiary company named Seaboard Advertising. By 1967, Jim Pattison had acquired all the shares of Neon Products/Seaboard and turned the public company into a private holding. Based in Burnaby, British Columbia, Seaboard served outdoor advertisers in British Columbia. The Seaboard name was retired in 1998 with the unification of all of Jim Pattison's outdoor advertising companies under the Pattison Outdoor Advertising name.\n\nHook Outdoor Advertising was founded as Hook Signs in Edmonton, Alberta in 1908 and incorporated as Hook Signs Ltd. in February, 1913. The company was a major supplier of store identification, display, vehicle and gold leaf signage in the early days of Edmonton. It introduced some of the first neon signs in the city 1939. In 1932, the company bought the billboards of the Ernest Willis Company in Calgary, Alberta and in 1936, the company bought the billboards of Ruddy Duker in Edmonton. Over the years the billboard advertising business overtook the display signage business until by the 1970s Hook was predominantly an outdoor advertising company. The company expanded beyond Edmonton and Calgary and by 1985 it served cities throughout the province of Alberta. The Jim Pattison Group bought the shares of Hook Signs Ltd. in 1981 and turned the company into a private holding, Hook Outdoor Advertising. The Hook name was retired in 1998 with the unification of all of Jim Pattison's outdoor advertising companies under the Pattison Outdoor Advertising name.\n\nGould Outdoor Advertising was founded in Midland, Ontario in 1913. The company established billboard advertising displays throughout southwestern Ontario, establishing major plants in Brantford, Kitchener/Waterloo, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and the Tobacco Belt Towns of the region. Gould was headquartered in Brantford. The company joined Seaboard and Hook as a Jim Pattison company in 1982. Merging in 1992 with Pillar Ad, another Pattison acquisition, Gould moved beyond its established markets in southwestern Ontario and embarked on a rapid expansion program in the Greater Toronto Area. The Gould name was retired in 1998 with the unification of all of Jim Pattison's outdoor advertising companies under the Pattison Outdoor Advertising name.\n\nThe transit advertising component of Pattison Outdoor is rooted in Trans Ad, a Canadian company founded in 1912. Trans Ad was acquired by the Jim Pattison Group in 1982. In 1990, the Trans Ad name and a portion of its operations were sold, and the balance of its operations was merged with Pattison-owned Seaboard Advertising, Hook Outdoor Advertising and Publicité Metrobus.\n\nPattison Outdoor Advertising was formed in 1998 through the union of the existing out of home advertising companies owned by the Jim Pattison Group.\n\nPattison Outdoor Advertising has traditional Outdoor Advertising posters in 300 cities and towns across Canada, from Vancouver Island on the west coast to St. John's, NL on the east coast. Beginning in 2008, the company has been building large-format L.E.D. digital billboards, and as of May 2013, has over 150 of these displays in 25 cities across Canada.\n\nIn March 2011, Pattison Outdoor Advertising acquired Onestop Media Group (Onestop), designers and operators of digital advertising networks for the transportation, malls, sports retail, residential and hospitality industries.\n\nIn January 2012, the Toronto Transit Commission awarded the contract for TTC transit advertising rights to Pattison Outdoor, guaranteeing the TTC $324 million in revenue over the next 12 years, until the end of 2023. This new agreement included new elements such as increased advertising space on the commission's fleet of buses, streetcars and subway cars, as well as opened the possibility of subway station naming rights.\n\nPattison Outdoor currently holds transit advertising contracts with twenty-one municipal transit authorities, and a number of third parties which give Pattison access to sell into an additional thirteen markets, including Quebec, and Saskatchewan.

In 2012 Greenpeace were engaged in talks with Pattison Outdoor Advertising to display a billboard advocating renewable energy sources, but the company abruptly terminated the discussions. When asked why the billboard would not be approved the company refused to provide a reason. In 2014 Pattison Outdoor Advertising allowed Friends of Science to place a billboard opposed to the scientific opinion on climate change, which prompted organizations like Greenpeace to accuse Pattison Outdoor Advertising and the Jim Pattison Group as a whole of applying a double standard and censoring environmentally friendly messages.\n\nPattison Outdoor is a member of:\n\n"}

He won a Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1993.\n\nWills has written over fifty books and, since 1973, has been a frequent reviewer for \"The New York Review of Books\". He became a faculty member of the history department at Northwestern University in 1980, where he is currently an Emeritus Professor of History.\n\nWills was born on May 22, 1934, in Atlanta, Georgia. His father, Jack Wills, was from a Protestant background, and his mother was from an Irish Catholic family. He was reared as Catholic and grew up in Michigan and Wisconsin, graduating in 1951 from Campion High School, a Jesuit institution in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. He entered and then left the Society of Jesus.\n\nWills earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Saint Louis University in 1957 and a Master of Arts degree from Xavier University in 1958, both in philosophy. William F. Buckley Jr. hired him as a drama critic for \"National Review\" magazine at the age of 23. He received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in classics from Yale University in 1961. He taught history at Johns Hopkins University from 1962 to 1980.\n\nWills has been married to Natalie Cavallo since 1959; she was the flight attendant on his first flight on an airplane. They have three children: John, Garry, and Lydia.\n\nA trained classicist, Wills is proficient in Ancient Greek and Latin. His home in Evanston, Illinois, is \"filled with books\", with a converted bedroom dedicated to English literature, another containing Latin literature and books on American political thought, one hallway full of books on economics and religion, \"including four shelves on St. Augustine\", and another with shelves of Greek literature and philosophy.\n\nWills describes himself as a Roman Catholic and, with the exception of a period of doubt during his seminary years, has been a Roman Catholic all his life. He continues to attend Mass at the Sheil Catholic Center in Northwestern University. He prays the rosary every day, and wrote a book about the devotion (\"The Rosary: Prayer Comes Around\") in 2005.\n\nWills has also been a critic of many aspects of church history and church teaching since at least the early 1960s. He has been particularly critical of the doctrine of papal infallibility; the social teaching of the church regarding homosexuality, abortion, contraception, and the Eucharist; and of the church's reaction to the sex abuse scandal.\n\nIn 1961, in a phone conversation with William F. Buckley Jr., Wills coined the famous macaronic phrase \"Mater si, magistra no\" (literally \"mother yes, teacher no\"). The phrase, which was a response to the papal encyclical \"Mater et magistra\" and a reference to the then-current anti-Castro slogan \"Cuba sí, Castro no\", signifies a devotion to the faith and tradition of the church combined with a skeptical attitude towards ecclesiastical authority.\n\nWills published a full-length analysis of the contemporary Catholic Church, \"Bare Ruined Choirs\", in 1972 and a full-scale criticism of the historical and contemporary church, \"Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit\", in 2000. He followed up the latter with a sequel, \"Why I Am a Catholic\" (2002), as well as with the books \"What Jesus Meant\" (2006), \"What Paul Meant\" (2006), and \"What the Gospels Meant\" (2008).\n\nWills began his career as an early protégé of William F. Buckley Jr. and was associated with conservatism. When he first became involved with \"National Review\" he did not know if he was a conservative, calling himself a distributist. Later on, he was self-admittedly conservative, being regarded for a time as the \"token conservative\" for the \"National Catholic Reporter\" and writing a book entitled \"Confessions of a Conservative\".\n\nHowever, during the 1960s and 1970s, driven by his coverage of both civil rights and the anti-Vietnam War movements, Wills became increasingly liberal. His biography of president Richard M. Nixon, \"Nixon Agonistes\" (1970) landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents. He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, but declared two years later that Obama's presidency had been a \"terrible disappointment\".\n\nIn 1995, Wills wrote an article about the Second Amendment for \"The New York Review of Books\". It was originally entitled \"Why We Have No Right to Bear Arms\", but that was not Wills' conclusion. He neither wrote the title nor approved it prior to the article's publication. Instead, Wills argued that the Second Amendment refers to the right to keep and bear arms in a military context only, rather than justifying private ownership and use of guns. Furthermore, he said the military context did not entail the right of individuals to overthrow the government of the United States:\n\n\"The New York Times\" literary critic John Leonard said in 1970 that Wills \"reads like a combination of H. L. Mencken, John Locke and Albert Camus.\" The Roman Catholic journalist John L. Allen Jr. considers Wills to be \"perhaps the most distinguished Catholic intellectual in America over the last 50 years\" (). Martin Gardner in \"The Strange Case of Garry Wills\" states there is a \"mystery and strangeness that hovers like a gray fog over everything Wills has written about his faith\".\n\n\nMaking Make-Believe Real: Politics as Theater in Shakespeare's Time (2014) \n\n"}

Many Zulu musicians(together with Xhosa musicians) have become a major part of South African music. A number of Zulu-folk derived styles have become well known across South Africa and abroad.\n\nKwaito is a music genre that emerged in Johannesburg, South Africa, during the 1990s. It is a variant of house music featuring the use of African sounds and samples. Typically at a slower tempo range than other styles of house music, Kwaito often contains catchy melodic and percussive loop samples, deep bass lines, and vocals. Despite its similarities to hip hop music, Kwaito has a distinctive manner in which the lyrics are sung, rapped and shouted. American producer Diplo has described Kwaito as \"slowed-down garage music,\" most popular among the black youth of South Africa.\n\nMaskanda (or Maskandi) is a kind of Zulu folk music that is evolving with South African society. Ethekwini Online describes it as \"The music played by the man on the move, the modern minstrel, today’s troubadour. It is the music of the man walking the long miles to court a bride, or to meet with his Chief; a means of transport. It is the music of the man who sings of his real life experiences, his daily joys and sorrows, his observations of the world. It’s the music of the man who’s got the Zulu blues.\"\n\nNowadays this is untrue in as much as it is no longer just the domain of men. African women - notably [Busi Mhlongo] - are also making Maskandi music. Maskandi music is largely popular and mostly consumed in the Kwa-Zulu Natal province, given its rich Zulu heritage and significance to the Zulu tribe. Looking at the genre from a record sales point of view...Maskandi happens to be the 2nd top selling genre in South Africa, after Gospel music. Although Maskandi music can be heard in more urban cities such as Johannesburg and Cape Town, it is important to note that it is largely the played by migrants who come to the big cities to seek a better quality of life and better employment opportunities. This music is typically considered backward and irrelevant by most city dwellers, given that the roots of the music are deeply entrenched in rural Kwa-Zuli Natal, and feature heavy elements of Zulu culture. Due to this, the music typically fails to connect with a wider audience and this is largely due to a lack of overall understanding of the genre, which subsequently leads to a lack of interest from listeners.\n\nAlthough the genre has been in existence for many years, after the 90's there seemed to be no real interest shown in the music by youths and young musicians. Due to the large influences by western and pop culture, these days most musicians choose to learn and perform western genres of music such as Hip-Hop, RnB and Turn up and the likes and this leads to the problem of having very few young Maskandi musicians to carry the genre forward, putting the future of the genre at risk. However Maskandi bands still exist with bands such as The Bunny Chows Carrots who are youth activists for the genre, and have dedicated their music to the preservation and appreciation of Maskandi music, as well as traditional forms of music as a whole. The band advocates for youth and future generations to learn from and co-innovate with their more experienced counterparts, in order to ensure the secrets and intricate nuances of Maskandi are properly and correctly preserved for future generations.\n\nMaskandi is well received and liked by the international community because of its originality, uniqueness and its difficulty to replicate. Between the 60s and early 90s Maskandi acts such as Johnston Zibokwakhe Mnyandu \"Phuzekhemisi\", Bhodloza Nzimande, Amatshitshi Amhlophe, Izingane Zoma, Bhekumuzi Luthuli (late) and Mfaz'Omnyama (late) contributed largely to exposing Maskandi to the international market.\n\nKasi rap originated from emzansi there are alot of Kasi rappers like sfilikwane,maseven,siyashezi and Chaka Dola everyone can make their own rap it originally from South Africa it started by ama pantsula and aboclever\n\nGqom is a style of music that emerged a decade into the 21st century from the city of Durban in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. The style features wavy and bass beats produced with software such as FL Studio, and has gained prominence in London. The word \"gqom\", sometimes expressed as \"qgom\", \"igqom\", \"gqomu\" or variants thereof, derives from an onomatopoeic combination of click consonants from the Zulu & the Xhosa language that represents a hitting drum. Music connoisseurs who were actively and rigorously involved in influencing the masses to accept and embrace the new, shift-shaping sound included the likes of South African rapper,\nOkmalumkoolkat, Italian record label Gqom Oh owner, Malumz Kole, Afrotainment record label owner, DJ Tira as well as music taste-maker and personal public relations liaison, Cherish LaLa Mankai. Related artists are DJ Lag, DJ Bongz, Lord The Dj,MasterT, Dj Noffoh, Dj Nkaa, Rudeboyz, Distruction Boyz & AudioBoyz.\n\n\"Mbube\" is both a song, originally released in the 1940s by Solomon Linda, and a genre of South African popular music that was inspired by it. \"Mbube\" was recorded in 1939 and became a major hit in Swaziland. The song was in a traditional Zulu choral style, which soon came to the attention of American musicologist Alan Lomax, who brought to the song to folk singer Pete Seeger, then of The Weavers. They made the song a Top 15 American hit in 1952 (as \"Wimoweh\"), though creator Solomon Linda was not credited; later, the Kingston Trio released a cover of it. Later still, The Tokens turned the song into \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", and it became a #1 American hit. The Durban-based Ladysmith Black Mambazo, formed by Joseph Shabalala in 1960, sings, among other styles, music in the \"mbube\" tradition.\n\nThe 1970s duo Juluka, consisting of a white man, Johnny Clegg, and a Zulu, Sipho Mchunu produced a blend of rock and Zulu folk music called maskanda, which has since evolved into an urban style called mbaqanga.\n\n"}

{"id": "1937465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937465", "title": "New Holland (Australia)", "text": "New Holland (Australia)\n\nNew Holland () is a historical European name for mainland Australia. \n\nThe name was first applied to Australia in 1644 by the Dutch seafarer Abel Tasman. The name came for a time to be applied in most European maps to the vaunted \"Southern land\" or \"Terra Australis\" even after its coastline was finally explored. \n\nThe continent Antarctica, later named in the 1890s, was still in largely speculative form; it resumed the name Terra Australis (sometimes suffixed Non Cognita, unknown). Its existence had been speculated on in some maps since the 5th century, under the theory of \"balancing hemispheres\". \n\nBritish settlement in Sydney as a colony in 1788 prompted Britain to formally claim the east coast as New South Wales, leading to a search for a new collective name. New Holland was never settled by the Dutch people, whose colonial forces and buoyant population had a settled preference for South Africa, Dutch Guyana, the Dutch East Indies and the Dutch West Indies. \n\nNew Holland continued to be used semi-officially and in popular usage as the name for the whole land mass until at least the mid-1850s.\n\nThe name \"New Holland\" was first applied to western and north coast of Australia in 1644 by the Dutch seafarer Abel Tasman, best known for his discovery of Tasmania (called by him \"Van Diemen's Land\"). The English Captain William Dampier used the name in his account of his two voyages there: the first arriving on 5 January 1688 and staying until March 12; his second voyage of exploration to the region was made in 1699. Except for giving its name to the land, neither the Netherlands nor the Dutch East India Company claimed any territory in Australia as its own. Although many Dutch expeditions visited the coast during the 200 years after the first Dutch visit in 1606, there was no lasting attempt at establishment of a permanent settlement. Most of the explorers of this period concluded that the apparent lack of water and fertile soil made the region unsuitable for colonisation.\n\nAfter British colonisation, the name \"New Holland\" was retained for several decades and the south polar continent continued to be called \"Terra Australis\", sometimes shortened to \"Australia\". However, in the nineteenth century, the colonial authorities gradually removed the Dutch name from the island continent and, instead of inventing a new name, they took the name \"Australia\" from the south polar continent, leaving a lacuna in continental nomenclature for eighty years. Even so, the name \"New Holland\" survived for many decades, used in atlases, literature and in common parlance.\n\nOn 22 August 1770, after sailing north along Australia's east coast, James Cook claimed the entire \"Eastern coast of New Holland\" that he had just explored as British territory. Cook first named the land \"New Wales\", but revised it to \"New South Wales\". With the establishment of a settlement at Sydney in 1788, the British solidified its claim to the eastern part of Australia, now officially called \"New South Wales\". In the commission to Governor Phillip the boundary was defined as the 135th meridian east longitude (135° east) (map from 25 April 1787), taking the line from Melchisédech Thévenot's chart, \"Hollandia Nova—Terre Australe,\" published in \"Relations de Divers Voyages Curieux\" (Paris, 1663).\n\nThe term \"New Holland\" was more often used to refer only to that part of the continent that had not yet been annexed to New South Wales; namely it referred to the western half of the continent. In 1804, the British navigator Matthew Flinders proposed the names \"Terra Australis\" or \"Australia\" for the whole continent, reserving \"New Holland\" for the western part of the continent. He continued to use \"Australia\" in his correspondence, while attempting to gather support for the term. Flinders explained in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks:\nThe propriety of the name Australia or Terra Australis, which I have applied to the whole body of what has generally been called New Holland, must be submitted to the approbation of the Admiralty and the learned in geography. It seems to me an inconsistent thing that captain Cooks New South Wales should be absorbed in the New Holland of the Dutch, and therefore I have reverted to the original name Terra Australis or the Great South Land, by which it was distinguished even by the Dutch during the 17th century; for it appears that it was not until some time after Tasman's second voyage that the name New Holland was first applied, and then it was long before it displaced T’Zuydt Landt in the charts, and could not extend to what was not yet known to have existence; New South Wales, therefore, ought to remain distinct from New Holland; but as it is requisite that the whole body should have one general name, since it is now known (if there is no great error in the Dutch part) that it is certainly all one land, so I judge, that one less exceptionable to all parties and on all accounts cannot be found than that now applied.\nHis suggestion was initially rejected, but the new name was approved by the British government in 1824. The western boundary of New South Wales was changed to 129° east in 1825 (16 July 1825 - Map). In 1826, to pre-empt a French settlement and claim to the territory, because of the importance of the route to New South Wales the British established the settlement of Albany in south-west New Holland. Governor Ralph Darling of New South Wales put Edmund Lockyer in command of the expedition and gave him the order that if he encountered the French anywhere he was to land troops, to signify to them that \"the whole of New Holland is subject to His Britannic Majesty's Government.\" In 1828 a further settlement was made, this time on the Swan River, and the name \"Swan River Colony\" was soon the term used to refer to the whole western part of the continent. The name \"New Holland\" was still invoked as the name for the whole continent when Charles Fremantle on 9 May 1829 took formal possession in the name of King George IV of \"all that part of New Holland which is not included within the territory of New South Wales.\" In 1832, the territory was officially renamed \"Western Australia\".\n\nEven as late as 1837, in official correspondence between the British government in London and New South Wales, the term \"New Holland\" was still being used to refer to the continent as a whole.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the continent continued to be called \"Nieuw Holland\" until about the end of the 19th century. The Dutch name today is \"Australië\".\n\nOne place where the name persists is in taxonomy. Many Australian species named in previous centuries have the specific name \"novaehollandiae\" or \"novae-hollandiae\", for example the emu, \"Dromaius novaehollandiae\".\n\nIn \"Gulliver's Travels\" by Jonathan Swift, the title character, travelling from Houyhnhnms Land, spends a few days on the southeast coast of New Holland before he is chased away by the natives.\n\nThe American author Edgar Allan Poe used the name \"New Holland\" to refer to Australia in his prize-winning 1833 short story \"MS. Found in a Bottle\":\n\nIn 1851, Herman Melville wrote, in a chapter of his novel \"Moby-Dick\" entitled \"Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish? – Will He Perish?\":\n\nIn 1854, another American writer, Henry David Thoreau, used the term \"New Holland\" (referring to the territory of the \"wild\" indigenous Australians) in his book \"Walden; or, Life in the Woods\", in which he writes:\n\n"}

Milder instances can be remedied by brief rest and the ingestion of food or drinks containing carbohydrates. The condition can usually be avoided by ensuring that glycogen levels are high when the exercise begins, maintaining glucose levels during exercise by eating or drinking carbohydrate-rich substances, or by reducing exercise intensity.\n\nThe term \"bonk\" for fatigue is presumably derived from the original meaning \"to hit\", and dates back at least half a century. Its earliest citation in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is a 1952 article in the \"Daily Mail.\"\n\nThe term is used colloquially as a noun (\"hitting the bonk\") and as a verb (\"to bonk halfway through the race\"). The condition is also known to long-distance (marathon) runners, who usually refer to it as \"hitting the wall\". The British may refer to it as \"hunger knock,\" while \"hunger bonk\" was used by South African cyclists in the 1960s.\n\nIt can also be referred to as \"blowing up\".\n\nIn German, hitting the wall is known as \"\"der Mann mit dem Hammer\"\" (\"the man with the hammer\"); the phenomenon is thus likened to a man with the hammer coming after the athlete, catching up, and eventually hitting the athlete, causing a sudden drop in performance.\n\nAthletes engaged in exercise over a long period of time produce energy via two mechanisms, both facilitated by oxygen: \n\nHow much energy comes from either source depends on the intensity of the exercise. During intense exercise that approaches one's VO max, most of the energy comes from glycogen.\n\nA typical untrained individual on an average diet is able to store about 380 grams of glycogen, or 1500 kcal, in the body, though much of that amount is spread throughout the muscular system and may not be available for any specific type of exercise. Intense cycling or running can easily consume 600–800 or more kcal per hour. Unless glycogen stores are replenished during exercise, glycogen stores in such an individual will be depleted after less than 2 hours of continuous cycling or 15 miles (24 km) of running. Training and carbohydrate loading can raise these reserves as high as 880 g (3600 kcal), correspondingly raising the potential for uninterrupted exercise.\n\nIn one study,\n\"reduction in preexercise muscle glycogen from 59.1 to 17.1 mumol X g-1 (n = 3) was associated with a 14% reduction in maximum power output but no change in maximum O2 intake; at any given power output O2 intake, heart rate, and ventilation (VE) were significantly higher, CO2 output (VCO2) was similar, and the respiratory exchange ratio was lower during glycogen depletion compared with control.\"\n\nThere are several approaches to prevent glycogen depletion:\n\n"}

It operates in markets including the United States and Canada. The Americas division is led by CEO Jeremy Male. Outfront Media operates both billboards and transit displays.\n\nTDI (Transportation Displays Incorporated) was the first predecessor company for transit advertising, publishing advertising for passenger railroad timetables and displays in railroad terminals. TDI was first incorporated in 1938. TDI was sold to IT&T in the early 1970s and then to the Winston Network in the early 1980s, it was later renamed TDI in 1989 led by Bill Apfelbaum. In 1996 the company was sold to Infinity Broadcasting. The transit business and the billboard business merged in 2001 under the name Viacom Outdoor.\n\nThe billboard division was originally two separate companies: 3M National, the outdoor advertising subsidiary of 3M; and Gannett Outdoor, owned by the Gannett Company. In August 1996, Gannett exited the billboard business by spinning off Gannett Outdoor into a new company, Outdoor Systems. This new company would later acquire 3M National in May 1997, but before that sale was finalized, the United States Justice Department ruled that Outdoor Systems had to sell nearly all of its 3M billboards in ten U.S. cities (all 3M billboards in Phoenix, Arizona; Sacramento, California; New Orleans; Louisville, Kentucky; Denver; Detroit; Kansas City, Missouri and Grand Rapids, Michigan; plus almost all 3M billboards in Atlanta and half of 3M's billboards in Houston) where both Outdoor Systems and 3M National already had billboards to Lamar Advertising to avoid a monopoly in these cities.\n\nOn December 7, 1999 Outdoor Systems (OSI) was bought by Infinity and became Infinity Outdoor. Infinity was absorbed into Viacom in 2001, and became Viacom Outdoor. When Viacom split from CBS Corporation in December 2005, it became CBS Outdoor. CBS owned CBS Outdoor as a division of CBS until March 2014, at which point it was spun off into an independent company. CBS Corporation continued to own 83% of Outfront Media, although this number is expected to decline over time as Outfront Media converts into a real estate investment trust and CBS Corporation divests itself of the outdoor unit. CBS Outdoor shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 28, 2014.\n\nIn July 2014, it was announced that CBS Outdoor would acquire the billboard business of Van Wagner Communications for $690 million.\n\nAs of July 17, 2014 CBS Outdoor became a fully independent corporation, operating as a real estate investment trust. The company announced it would rename itself as to Outfront Media, Inc., effective November 20, 2014. The company's ticker symbol on the NYSE changed from CBSO to OUT. A rebranding program converted billboards, signage and displays from CBS Outdoor to Outfront logos.\n\nIn October 2015, Outfront Media refused to post New York City Subway ads involving Thinx underwear for women, on the basis that the word period was used in the advertisement copy and was accompanied by images of grapefruits.\n\nSince then, Outfront Media has expanded its initiatives, such as a campaign with Dogology Inc., a virtual dog training startup, and the installation of digital advertising screens in the New York City Subway. These campaigns have been highly successful. Further, executives were devising new strategies with the growth of 5G technology.\n\nIn September 2018 ‘Today, I’m Brave,’ the Los Angeles-based non-profit born out of creative agency David&Goliath, put together a fundraising initiative with the purpose of aiding Puerto Rico's recovery from Hurricane Maria. As part of this effort, Outfront donated a billboard that went up in the heart of Hollywood on the one year anniversary of Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma to commemorate and raise funds for hurricane victims. In October 2018, an 18-member coalition of Chicago Southland churches, synagogues and mosques spread the message \"One God, Three Faiths\" using Outfront billboards.

{"id": "1937483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937483", "title": "Club Med", "text": "Club Med\n\nClub Med SAS, commonly known as Club Med and previously known as Club Méditerranée SA, is a Chinese-owned company headquartered in France, specializing in all-inclusive holidays. The company is primarily owned by Fosun Group and either wholly owns or operates over seventy all-inclusive resort villages in holiday locations around the world.\n\nThe Club was started in 1950 by Belgian entrepreneur Gérard Blitz. Blitz had opened a low-priced summer colony of tents on the Spanish island of Majorca. Gilbert Trigano supplied the tents, and in 1953 Blitz wooed him into a partnership. The first official Club Med was built the next year in Palinuro, Salerno Italy. The original villages were simple: Members stayed in unlit straw huts on a beachfront, sharing communal washing facilities. Such villages have been replaced with modern blocks or huts with ensuite facilities.\n\nIn 1961, the company was purchased by the 35-year-old Baron Edmond de Rothschild after he had visited a resort and enjoyed his stay. With Rothschild financing, the number of villages increased greatly under Trigano's leadership from 1963 to 1993. Winter villages, providing skiing and winter sports tuition, were introduced in 1956 at Leysin, Switzerland. In 1965, the first club outside the Mediterranean was opened in Tahiti. Club Med broadened its reach by opening villages in the Caribbean and Florida where English rather than French was the main language.\n\nOriginally attracting mainly singles and young couples, the Club later became primarily a destination for families, with the first Mini Club opening in 1967.\n\nThe Club has also ceased to be a club in the legal sense, changing from a not-for-profit association to a for-profit public limited company (French SA) in 1995. However, each new customer is still charged a membership fee upon joining, and returning customers are charged an annual fee as well.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Club's fortunes declined because competitors copied its concepts and holidaymakers demanded more sophisticated offerings. Serge Trigano took over from his father but was replaced in 1997 by Philippe Bourguignon, former CEO of EuroDisney.\n\nBourguignon aimed to change the Club \"from a holiday village company to a services company\". The club took over a chain of French gyms, launched bar/restaurant complexes known as Club Med World in Paris and Montreal, and commenced a budget resort concept aimed at young adults. Oyyo was the first such resort, opened at Monastir in Tunisia. Thirteen new villages were planned for the new century.\n\nThe change in strategy was not successful, and the Club fell into a deep loss following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the U.S. In 2002, a new CEO, Henri Giscard d'Estaing, was appointed. His strategy was to refocus on the holiday villages and attract upmarket vacationers. Oyyo, Club Med World Montreal and many villages, particularly those in North America or with more basic facilities, were closed. The Club returned to profitability in 2005.\n\nIn 2004, the hotel group Accor became the largest shareholder, but it sold most of its stake in 2006, announcing that it wished to refocus on its core businesses. From 2001 onward, the resort company worked to rebrand itself as upscale and family-oriented.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Club Med and its partners dedicated a total of $530 million to renovate several resorts.\n\nIn February 2015, Fosun International Ltd.'s Gaillon Invest II and The Silverfern Group finalized a takeover deal of Club Méditerranée S.A. The acquisition culminated a bidding war that began in May 2013, which was conducted by Gaillon, a special investment vehicle used by Fosun, to execute its bidding for Club Med. The two-year-long war boosted the price of the company from the initial €541 million \"friendly bid\" in 2013 up to the final sale price of €939 million ($1.07 billion). Gaillon Invest's chairman, Jiannong Qian, believes that Chinese ownership of the company is crucial to tap into China's huge population of potential tourists. Following the takeover, Chairman and President of Club Méditerranée SA, Henri Giscard d'Estaing, was named President of Club Med SAS.\n\nEach resort provides a list of services and activities in one single package. This includes lodging, food, use of facilities, sports activities, games, and shows. Certain items such as premium alcoholic beverages previously required the use of beads or tickets as a form of payment; this is not required anymore.\n\nClub Med staff are called \"GOs\", or \"Gentils Organisateurs \" (Gracious/Nice Organizers). Clients are \"GMs\", or \"Gentils Membres\" (Gracious/Nice Guests/Members). The resort is known as a \"village\". The resort manager is called the \"Chef de Village\" (Village Chief). Chefs de Villages are responsible for the ambiance of the resort, well-being of guests, coordinate with the corporate offices, and oversee the general day-to-day operations of the resorts. Chefs de Villages are often seen doing daily tours of the resort that involves checking in with guests. Resort managers are also responsible for announcing the evening program and leading a few 'crazy signs' (communal dances), before passing the microphone to the Assistant Chef de Village, Events Manager, or Sports Manager. Each village contains a team of managers, ranging from Events Manager, Sports Manager, Leisure Manager, Restaurant Manager, Bar Manager, Reception Manager, etc...\n\nThe special feature of Club Med is that the GOs and GMs play, dine, drink, and dance together every day and night. Daytime and evening sport-playing, and evening shows with audience participation, are often part of the holiday experience.\n\nA particular institution is the communal dance or \"crazy signs\" led by the GOs at varying intervals during the day and evening (the frequency varies by village). The dance steps for each song are standard across the organization with some new ones introduced each year. The evening shows, often requiring detailed choreography, are also standardized and include both new and established routines.\n\n\"Hands Up (Give Me Your Heart)\" by Ottawan is regularly played to accompany the crazy signs during the evening shows.\n\nGOs are moved between villages and many work both winter and summer seasons. All GOs, regardless of their area of specialty (a sport or administrative function), are expected to regularly participate in both the show and \"crazy signs\". Their work is supplemented by locally recruited support staff such as cleaners and cooks, known as \"GEs\" or \"Gentils Employés\" (Gracious/Nice Employees). Club Med offers GOs a six-month renewable contract, which includes competitive pay, and room and board included. In the summer season, villages like Club Med Columbus Isle will offer GOs a three-month renewable contract.\n\nThere are 15,000 GOs of 96 different nationalities working in the villages around the world and most of them reside in the village.\n\nMost villages are designed for families, with villages providing daytime supervised facilities for children: the \"Baby\", \"Petit\", \"Mini\", \"Junior\" clubs and 12 Passworld facilities worldwide which offer a special hang out space for 11- to 17-year-olds.\n\nThe villages are now divided into three different types:\n\n, the resort company either owns or operates over seventy villages in Europe, Africa and Middle East, North America, Mexico, the Caribbean, South America, Asia, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn 2007 Club Med launched its Exclusive Collection with the opening of its first 5 Trident resort, La Plantation d'Albion located in Mauritius. \n\nIn 2009 Club Med began construction on Les Villas d'Albion, a property adjacent to La Plantation d'Albion containing over 30 2, 3 or 4-bedroom villas. These villas can be purchased by guests and rented out by Club Med when the owner is not using the villa. \n\nClub Med also has a residence property at its ski resort of Valmorel in France, consisting of a series of 2, 3 and 4-bedroom chalets. \n\nThe group has expanded its Exclusive Collection with the construction of '5 Trident Zones' at a number of its resorts; these areas contain facilities only available to guests staying in the top-tier accommodation at the resort. \n\nIn 2016 Club Med opened its second Exclusive Collection resort in the Maldives, the Finolhu Villas, located a short boat ride away from the other Maldives property, Kani. \n\nOn 3 June 2018, President Henri Giscard d'Estaing inaugurated the company's third Exclusive Collection and 5 Trident resort Club Med Cefalù, near Palermo, in Sicily, Italy; the first 5 Trident resort in the European zone. \n\nIn April 2018, CEO of Club Med North America Xavier Mufraggi along with the president of the Dominican Republic announced that Club Med would open the first 5 Trident resort in the American zone in Michès, Dominican Republic (sixty miles from the Punta Cana airport). Club Med Michès Playa Esmeralda would be the first Club Med village opened in the American zone in nearly twenty years.\n\nThe phrase \"Club Med- a cheap holiday in other people's misery\" appeared as a Situationist slogan, written in graffiti in Paris, May 1968. The phrase was described as a commentary on alienation, domination, and \"the false promises of modern life\". The slogan was later given a nod to in the opening lyrics of the Sex Pistols song \"Holidays in the Sun\".\n\nThe Club Med style of vacation was satirized in the 1978 film, \"Les Bronzés\" (released in English as \"French Fried Vacation\") directed by Patrice Leconte.

The XDH assumption holds that there exist certain subgroups of elliptic curves which have useful properties for cryptography. Specifically, XDH implies the existence of two distinct groups formula_1 with the following properties:\n\n\nThe above formulation is referred to as asymmetric XDH. A stronger version of the assumption (symmetric XDH, or SXDH) holds if DDH is \"also\" intractable in formula_3.\n\nThe XDH assumption is used in some pairing-based cryptographic protocols. In certain elliptic curve subgroups, the existence of an efficiently-computable bilinear map (pairing) can allow for practical solutions to the DDH problem. These groups, referred to as gap Diffie–Hellman (GDH) groups, facilitate a variety of novel cryptographic protocols, including tri-partite key exchange, identity based encryption, and secret handshakes (to name a few). However, the ease of computing DDH within a GDH group can also be an obstacle when constructing cryptosystems; for example, it is not possible to use DDH-based cryptosystems such as ElGamal within a GDH group. Because the DDH assumption holds within at least one of a pair of XDH groups, these groups can be used to construct pairing-based protocols which allow for ElGamal-style encryption and other novel cryptographic techniques.\n\nIn practice, it is believed that the XDH assumption may hold in certain subgroups of MNT elliptic curves. This notion was first proposed by Scott (2002), and later by Boneh, Boyen and Shacham (2002) as a means to improve the efficiency of a signature scheme. The assumption was formally defined by Ballard, Green, de Medeiros and Monrose (2005), and full details of a proposed implementation were advanced in that work. Evidence for the validity of this assumption is the proof by Verheul (2001) and Galbraith and Rotger (2004) of the non-existence of distortion maps in two specific elliptic curve subgroups which possess an efficiently computable pairing. As pairings and distortion maps are currently the only known means to solve the DDH problem in elliptic curve groups, it is believed that the DDH assumption therefore holds in these subgroups, while pairings are still feasible between elements in distinct groups.\n\n"}

Located in historic Lesser Poland, it is part of the Masovian Voivodeship, about 100 km southwest of Warsaw and 40 km west of Radom. It is the capital of Przysucha County, and the town 6,762 inhabitants (2004). Its name in Yiddish is ' or ' (pronounced: Pshiskhe). In the past, it was home to a number of Hasidic Rabbis, such as The Holy Jew and Simcha Bunim of Peshischa.\n\nPrzysucha is located on the Radomka river, along national road nr. 12 (which in the future will make Expressway S12). Rail station Przysucha is located in the village of Skrzyńsko, on the line from Radom to Łódź.\n\nFirst mention of Przesucha, as it was known then, comes from 1415. In the early 16th century, the village belonged to the Morsztyn family. Przysucha had a public house, a watermill, and a forge, and it belonged to the parish of Skrzyńsko. On December 11, 1710, upon a royal privilege, issued by King Augustus II the Strong, artisans were allowed to settle in the town, and a weekly market was established. Later on, two markets a week were permitted, and a manufactory was opened in town, along the Radomka river.\n\nGerman artisans from Silesia and Saxony founded in the early 18th century a settlement called Czermno, which today is part of Przysucha. In Przysucha itself, the number of Jews rapidly grew. At that time, the town was a major center of Hasidism. In 1777, Przysucha had 39 German, 85 Jewish, and 29 Polish houses. The town was divided into three parts - Germans lived in Czermno, Jews in Przysucha, and Poles - in Urszulin. Przysucha also was one of centers of early industry. In the late 18th century, it had a blast furnace, a sawmill, and a paper mill. Since its origins to 1795 Przysucha belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship.\n\nAfter the Partitions of Poland, the period of prosperity ended. Przysucha remained a private town, and its industry was obsolete. In 1870, Tsarist authorities deprived Przysucha of its town rights. \n\nPrzysucha was a center of Chassidic Judaism. Seven important Hasidic rebbes are buried in the town's Jewish cemetery, established soon after Jews settled in the area in 1713. The Przysucha Synagogue was built between 1764 and 1777, and is the largest extant baroque synagogue in Poland. \n\nJews numbered 2,980 out of 4,850 residents in 1939. During World War II, Przysucha was bombed on September 6, 1939, when 70 houses were destroyed. Germans opened a ghetto with more than 5,000 Jews and murdered most of them at the Treblinka extermination camp.\n\nUnderground resistance was strong in Przysucha and the county. On September 6, 1944, German forces lost 140 soldiers, and 230 were wounded in a battle near the village of Stefanów. Soviet troops entered the town on January 17, 1945.\n\nImmediately after the war, Przysucha had 1,500 inhabitants. In 1956 it became the seat of a county, and two years later it regained its town rights. During Communist times, several enterprises were opened there - clay mine, ceramics factory, fruit and vegetable processor. \nAmong points of interest are:\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "1937542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937542", "title": "Living in Oblivion", "text": "Living in Oblivion\n\nLiving in Oblivion is an independent dark comedy film, written and directed by Tom DiCillo and starring Steve Buscemi, Catherine Keener, Dermot Mulroney, Danielle von Zerneck and James LeGros. The film won Tom DiCillo the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival. The film was acclaimed by critics. It also marks Peter Dinklage's film debut.\n\nThe film is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast.\n\nPart one: Director Nick Reve (Steve Buscemi) is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother (Rica Martens) for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of how the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole (Catherine Keener) berates herself for acting badly, Cora (Rica Martens) reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf (Dermot Mulroney), who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set.\n\nPart two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino (James LeGros) is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character \"Ellen\" and Chad's character \"Damian\" have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a \"Hostess Twinkie motherfucker\" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the entire segment.\n\nPart three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, \"you just got to roll with things.\" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito (Peter Dinklage) complains that the dream sequence is a cliché (\"\"I\" don't even have dreams with dwarves in them!\") and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is \"ready\". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and during this moment they each daydream about different things. They go on to shooting the next sequence.\n\n\nDiCillo got inspiration for the film from the frustrations he experienced when making the film \"Johnny Suede\", and his long struggle to make his next intended film, \"Box of Moonlight\". \"Living in Oblivion\" was rejected by all producers but the actors and friends of the director felt so strongly about the project that they financed it. Two of the producers, Michael Griffiths and Hilary Gilford, were given parts in the movie to thank them for providing finance. Griffiths plays Speedo, the sound mixer; Gilford plays the unnamed Script girl. The film is divided into three parts. The first part was shot in five days and after DiCillo realized that it was too short to be a feature and too long to be a short he expanded it into a full feature film with parts two and three. The film title was taken from the hit 80's song by synth pop artists Anything Box.\n\nThe film won Tom DiCillo the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival. The film was acclaimed by critics. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gives it a score of 88% based on reviews from 32 critics.\nAmerican Film Institute recognition:\n\nThe 2003 Sony Pictures Home Entertainment release includes a Commentary by DiCillo; Deleted Scenes; and an interview with Tom and Steve Buscemi.\n\nShout! Factory released a 2 disc set Blu-Ray November 17, 2015. It's the only DiCillo film to have been officially released on Blu-Ray.\n\n"}

The episode was written by showrunner Manny Coto and directed by LeVar Burton. \"Demons\" is the first part of a two part story, concluding with \"Terra Prime\".\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. In this episode, the crew returns to Earth to participate in a conference to set up a trade coalition of alien races. While there they discover a plot involving a xenophobic human organisation called \"Terra Prime\".\n\nPeter Weller, who later appeared in \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013), guest-starred as John Frederick Paxton, and other guest stars included Harry Groener, who had previously appeared in episodes of both \"The Next Generation\" and \"\". Filming of the episode overlapped with that of several other episodes, and sets included both the standing sets and an alleyway on the Paramount lot which was previously used in the \"\" episode \"\". The critical response to the episode was mostly positive with one reviewer stating that the two-parter posed similar ideological questions to those seen in \"\".\n\n\"Enterprise\" returns to Earth in order to attend the formation of a \"Coalition of Planets\". Nathan Samuels, a United Earth government minister, gives a speech, but he fails to mention the contribution they made to get the aliens to work collaboratively. A woman, later identified as Susan Khouri, staggers over to T'Pol and produces a vial containing a hair follicle, before collapsing and dying from a phaser wound. Back on board \"Enterprise\", Doctor Phlox examines the hair's DNA, learning it is from the child of Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker, but T'Pol denies ever being pregnant.\n\nCaptain Archer meets with Samuels, who is concerned that news of the child will stir xenophobic sentiment. Lieutenant Reed is ordered by Archer to liaise with Harris of Section 31. He is informed that Khouri was a member of Terra Prime, an anti-alien movement. Meanwhile, in the Terra Prime headquarters on the Moon, John Frederick Paxton and Doctor Mercer discuss the child. After Mercer leaves, Paxton sends for Daniel Greaves and tells him to deal with Mercer. On Earth, Archer tells Samuels that he knows that the minister was a former member of Terra Prime and convinces him to provide a case file on Khouri. Meanwhile, Ensign Mayweather gives his reporter ex-girlfriend, Gannet Brooks, a tour of the ship.\n\nOn the Moon, Paxton watches footage of Colonel Phillip Green (\"The Savage Curtain\"). Greaves enters and updates Paxton on the status of the child, and Paxton injects himself in the neck with an unknown substance. Phlox then reports that Khouri's body contained traces of a substance used in a zero-gravity mining facility. T'Pol and Tucker volunteer for an away mission to the Moon. Disguised as miners, they are quickly detained after Brooks apparently leaks details of the mission. Paxton reveals that the entire complex is a warp capable ship, and the vessel travels to Mars where it takes control of the verteron array, which normally protects the Earth from comets. He uses the array to fire a warning shot and issue an ultimatum — that all non-humans must immediately leave Earth.\n\nShowrunner and writer Manny Coto explained that the \"demons\" in the episode refers to the demons of intolerance that humanity must defeat before they can form the United Federation of Planets. Colonel Philip Green (the leading villain of World War III in the \"Star Trek\" universe) was originally intended to appear earlier in the season in the episode \"\" but the episode was instead re-written to feature Arik Soong after \"The Next Generation\" actor Brent Spiner became available; Green's appearance was one of several included in season four which linked \"Enterprise\" to \"The Original Series\", which included the Mirror Universe and Gorn in \"In a Mirror, Darkly\", Organians in \"Observer Effect\" and the Orions in \"Borderland\" and \"\".\n\nPeter Weller was cast in the role of John Frederick Paxton. Weller had previously appeared in other science fiction productions, including as the main character in the film \"RoboCop\" (1987). He also played Chuck Taggart in the television series \"Odyssey 5\", which had been created by Manny Coto. Weller said of the plot of the episode, \"The great thing about the whole \"Star Trek\" legacy is that they... metaphorize, they allegorize and they narrate what's going on the planet today\". He would later go on to gain a role in the film \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013). This was the third \"Star Trek\" appearance of Harry Groener, who played Nathan Samuels. He had previously portrayed Tam Elbrum in \"The Next Generation\" episode \"\" and the Magistrate in the \"\" episode \"\". Eric Pierpoint returned as Harris, whom he had previously played earlier in the season in the episode \"\". Game show host Tom Bergeron made a cameo in the episode as a Coridan Ambassador. He had previously appeared as D'Marr in the first-season episode \"\".\n\nThe episode was directed by former \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" actor LeVar Burton, his second of the season, and his ninth and final for the series. Filming began on February 4, 2005 and completed on February 14. The first day of shooting overlapped with the filming for the previous episode, \"In a Mirror, Darkly\". The first day was spent filming scenes involving Mayweather and Brooks, while the second day overlapped with a re-shoot of the conclusion of the episode \"\" and inserts for \"Affliction\" and \"\". The following three days were spent on the standing sets such as the bridge and sickbay, before moving onto the standing cave sets on stage 9. These had previously been painted white for use in \"The Aenar\", and were repainted grey to represent the tunnels on the Moon for \"Demons\".\n\nThe only exterior location used was an alleyway on the Paramount lot near the soundstages. The alley had previously been used as a location in the \"\" episode \"\". Production moved to the Paramount Theatre on the final day of filming, which hosted the season premieres. It was used to portray the Assembly Hall of Starfleet Command. The footage of Colonel Green was shot later, with a greenscreen placed on the monitor during the filming with Weller.\n\n\"Demons\" was first aired in the United States on UPN on May 6, 2005. It received a 2/4% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was an increase of the overall audience share compared to the previous episode aired.\n\nMichelle Erica Green at TrekNation described the episode as a \"riveting hour of television\". She thought that the episode posed the same types of ideological questions that \"The Original Series\" did on occasion and caused her to look forward to the following episode. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website \"Jammer's Reviews\" gave the episode a score of three out of four, saying that it was a \"pretty good story [told] in an exceptionally average way\". Jay Garmon, whilst compiling a list of the best episodes of \"Enterprise\" for TechRepublic, listed \"Demons\" and \"Terra Prime\" as the third best. He thought that Peter Weller \"stole the show\", and that it created a \"solid conclusion\" to the show despite the following episode, \"These Are the Voyages...\"\n\nIn a 2015 interview with some of the show's cast with SyFy, this episode was a recommended favorite of theirs and they suggested that the combination of \"Demons\" and \"Terra Prime\" was alternate finale for Enterprise.\n\n\"Demons\" was released on home media in the United States on November 1, 2005, as part of the season four DVD box set of \"Enterprise\". The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.\n\n"}

With over $5.1 million in winnings, he is currently the 2nd highest-earning American game show contestant of all time, behind Ken Jennings, and still the highest-earning contestant (primarily from special tournament events) on the U.S. syndicated game show \"Jeopardy!\" (with over $5 million).\n\nUntil \"Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time\" in 2020, Rutter had never lost a \"Jeopardy!\" match against a human opponent (though he twice trailed at the end of the first game of a two-day tournament match before coming back to win). This streak comprised his original 5-day run in 2000, as well as 17 matches in five tournaments—all of which he (or his team) won. In 2011, both Rutter and Ken Jennings (another holder, at various times, of the all-time money record for \"Jeopardy!\" and for game shows) were routed in a two-day exhibition match against an IBM computer platform developed specifically to compete on \"Jeopardy!\": Watson. Rutter finished third in the match—both his first defeat overall and the first time he finished behind a human opponent. Because the man versus machine match was declared an exhibition, none of the records from it count toward official show records.\n\nUntil 2009, Rutter lived in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he hosted \"InQuizitive\", a local broadcast quiz show for high school students. He has also been a reader and judge for the high school National Academic Championship. He now lives in Los Angeles where he is pursuing acting.\n\nRutter is a 1995 graduate of Manheim Township High School in Neffsville, Pennsylvania, where he was on the quiz bowl team. The team won second place at the 1994 Texaco Star National Academic Championship. He is one of the 19 people to have been named to the National Academic Championship Hall of Fame in its 25-year history. At the 2005 Manheim Township High School graduation ceremony, he announced the start of a scholarship fund in memory of his late high-school quiz bowl coach, Anne Clouser.\n\nRutter described himself as a slacker in school and a Johns Hopkins dropout (while there, he studied English). Before his success on \"Jeopardy!\", he worked at the Lancaster Coconuts record store.\n\nRutter first appeared on \"Jeopardy!\" on October 30, 2000, when the rules stipulated that a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions. Rutter retired as an undefeated 5-day champion, with $55,102 in winnings (he was also awarded a choice of Chevrolet cars of which he picked two Chevrolet Camaros; at the time, Jeopardy awarded new cars to 5-day undefeated champions). The rules were changed in 2003, before Ken Jennings' run of 74 consecutive days in 2004, which made Jennings the largest overall \"Jeopardy!\" money winner.\n\nAs a 5-day champion, Rutter was invited to the 2001 Tournament of Champions, where he defeated other 5-day champions and won the $100,000 main prize. He was invited back for the 2002 Million Dollar Masters Tournament, where he won the $1,000,000 main prize and became the largest overall money winner in \"Jeopardy!\" history.\n\nRutter returned for the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions, winning the tournament and $2,115,000. After his 2005 tournament win, in which he defeated Jennings and Jerome Vered in the finals, Rutter surpassed Jennings as the highest money-winner ever on American game shows. Jennings later regained his record by 2008 after appearing on various other game shows. There is a minor discrepancy between sources as to Rutter's total \"Jeopardy!\" winnings stemming from the prize structure of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions. Players who won in the first round earned $15,000, but Rutter was among nine top winners who received a first round bye. While some analysts suggest that Rutter's money totals should include $15,000 for a first round 'win' in this tournament, the official Jeopardy.com website does not count it (when stating that Rutter's winnings were $3,255,102 after the completion of this tournament).\n\nFrom February 14–16, 2011, the \"Jeopardy!\" IBM Challenge featured IBM's Watson facing off against Rutter and Jennings in a two-game, cumulative-total match aired over three days. It was the first ever man-versus-machine competition in \"Jeopardy!\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s history. The computer program, equipped with a precisely timed mechanical \"thumb\", won handily, finishing with a $77,147 score, while Jennings took second place with a score of $24,000 over Rutter's $21,600 score. IBM donated its $1 million purse to two charities. Jennings and Rutter did likewise with half of their respective winnings of $300,000 and $200,000. Rutter donated $100,000 to the Lancaster County Community Foundation.\n\nRutter participated in the \"Jeopardy!\" 2014 Battle of the Decades, pitting top champions from throughout the previous 30 years of \"Jeopardy!\". He appeared in the 1990s week of the tournament. He won the March 7, 2014, game against Mike Dupee and Jill Bunzendahl Chimka. He then appeared in the quarterfinals of the tournament on May 7, 2014 against Dan Pawson and Mark M. Lowenthal and won the game in a lock. On May 13, 2014, he defeated Leszek Pawlowicz and Tom Cubbage in the semifinals. On May 16, 2014, he won the tournament and $1,000,000, defeating Ken Jennings and Roger Craig in the finale after the former missed the Final Jeopardy clue. With this win, Rutter regained the record as the highest money-winner on American game shows, which Jennings had held since 2008.\n\nIn 2019, Rutter teamed with fellow \"Jeopardy!\" champions Larissa Kelly and Dave Madden to win the \"Jeopardy!\" All-Star Games. Rutter was team captain and they split the top prize of $1,000,000.\n\nRutter competed in the \"Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time\" event in January 2020 against Jennings and James Holzhauer, and ended up winning $250,000 with a third place finish to Jennings and Holzhauer.\n\nHe appeared on the U.S. game show \"1 vs. 100\" (as a member of \"the Mob\") on December 1, 2006, and again on December 8, 2006. He answered every question correctly and was one of only seven mob members to survive to the next show, as was Annie Duke. He would be eliminated on the December 15 episode on a question about Jewish reggae musician Matisyahu. He appeared again on February 9, 2007, and was eliminated late in a winner-takes-$250,000 \"last man standing\" competition, but before Ken Jennings was. Rutter was the top seed in \"Grand Slam\", but lost in the second round to Ogi Ogas, a former \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" contestant.\n\nRutter competed in the 2010 World Quizzing Championship, where he finished 140th. He was also a contestant on the 6th episode of Million Dollar Mind Game (aired on November 27, 2011), where his team won $600,000. In May 2012, he did a pilot episode as a \"Chaser\" for an American version of the British game show \"The Chase\". Fox network ordered two pilots for consideration in its lineup. The Chaser in the other pilot was Mark Labbett, one of the five Chasers on both the British and Australian versions of the show. Despite the show not being picked up by Fox, it was later aired by GSN, with Labbett (the Beast) as the only Chaser.\n\nIn May 2020, Rutter appeared on a revival of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire as an in-person lifeline for celebrity contestant Catherine O'Hara. On the show, celebrities playing for charity were allowed to have an expert assist them in answering the first 10 questions—Rutter served as O'Hara's expert and helped her answer each of the 10 questions correctly. After this point, O'Hara made the decision to trade her 50:50 lifeline for the opportunity to consult Rutter once more on any of the remaining questions. She took this opportunity on the $125,000 question, which he once again helped her answer correctly. O'Hara's final total on the show was $250,000, as she chose to walk away from the $500,000 question.\n\nRutter subsequently moved to Southern California to pursue a career as an actor and TV host.\n\nIn 2017, he competed in a Los Angeles citywide pub tournament as part of Team of Enchantment (along with Brian Fodera, Matthew Frost, Pam Mueller, Jerome Vered, and Hans von Walter), taking home his share of a $10,000 prize.\n\n"}

{"id": "1937571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937571", "title": "Willem Pijper", "text": "Willem Pijper\n\nWillem Frederik Johannes Pijper (); 8 September 1894 – 18 March 1947) was a Dutch composer, music critic and music teacher. Pijper is considered to be among the most important Dutch composers of the first half of the 20th century.\n\nPijper was born at Zeist, near Utrecht, on 8 September 1894 of strict Calvinist working-class parents. His father, who sometimes played psalm accompaniments on the harmonium, taught him the names of the notes of the treble clef when he was five. Willem subsequently discovered the use of sharps and flats and began composing simple melodies. His fascination with symmetrical musical structures was evident even at this early age. At ten he began formal piano lessons and made rapid progress.\n\nPoor health as a child meant that he was educated at home until age 13, but in 1912, after three years study at the gymnasium (high school), Pijper entered the Utrecht Academy of Music, where he was taught composition by Johan Wagenaar, passing examinations in theoretical subjects in 1915. Apart from his brief study with Wagenaar he was entirely self-taught as a composer.\n\nPijper occasionally gave piano recitals, but his activity as a critic was of greater importance. At the end of the First World War, he became a critic for the \"Utrechtsch Dagblad\", and in that capacity was at least partly responsible for the departure of Jan van Gilse, then chief conductor of the Utrechts Stedelijk Orkest. Pijper’s constant vitriolic (and often \"ad hominem\") attacks upon Van Gilse forced the latter to demand the orchestra board to refuse Pijper at concerts; after the board had stalled the issue for some time, Van Gilse resigned in 1921. Pijper has since been criticised for his role in the affair, also because his combined functions of critic and advisor for the Tivoli concert hall at least suggested a conflict of interest (Article about the Van Gilse/Pijper conflict in De Volkskrant (in Dutch)).\n\nIn 1926, with Paul F. Sanders, he established the periodical \"De Muziek\", to which he contributed many essays. Collections of his essays were published by Querido under the title \"De Quintencirckel\" and \"De Stemvork\".\n\nPijper spent much of his time during the war years working on a new opera, \"Merlijn\", based on the Arthurian legend. Although he worked on the project for over six years, the work was never completed. In late 1946, he was diagnosed with cancer. During the closing weeks of his life he rewrote the orchestration to his \"Concerto for Violoncello and Orchestra\". Pijper died in Utrecht on 18 March 1947.\n\nPijper quickly chose his own path as a composer. The difference in style between his First Symphony (\"Pan\"; 1917) (in which Mahler's influence is evident) and the Second (1921) is significant, and between 1918 and 1922 he grew into one of the more advanced composers in Europe. In each successive work he went a step further, starting from his conception that every work of art arises out of a number of \"germ cells\" (somewhat akin to Igor Stravinsky's early \"cell technique\").\n\nFrom 1919, Pijper's music can be described as polytonal. Yet there is no question of Pijper's consciously abandoning tonality; rather his polyphonic way of thinking and his sense of counterpoint made his harmonic style evolve in that direction. In that sense, he stands quite close to the music of his contemporary Matthijs Vermeulen, but his music does not quite reach the ecstatic level of Vermeulen's. Nonetheless, Pijper remained a composer of strong emotional character, to which his Third Symphony (1926) bears witness. In Pijper's later works the harmonic expression seems at times to approach monotonality.\n\nThe octatonic scale has been called the \"Pijper scale\" in Dutch. As a teacher, Pijper had a great influence on modern Dutch music, teaching many prominent Dutch composers of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. He was senior teacher of instrumentation at the Amsterdam Conservatoire, and from 1930 until his death in 1947 he acted as principal of the Rotterdam Conservatoire.\n\n\nAdapted with permission from John Craton's Willem Pijper web page\n\nSelected recordings[edit]\n\n\n"}

He has been the fifth Archbishop of Los Angeles since 2011. He previously served as Auxiliary Bishop of Denver from 2001–2004 and as Archbishop of San Antonio from 2004–2010. \n\nBeginning on November 15, 2016, Gomez served as Vice President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; his term as Vice President ended with his election as President on November 12, 2019. He is the first person of Hispanic descent to hold both positions.\n\nGómez was born in Monterrey, Mexico, to José H. Gómez and Esperanza Velasco. One of five children, he has three older sisters and one younger sister. He attended the Monterrey Institute of Technology before entering the National University of Mexico where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy in 1975. While attending college, he joined Opus Dei, a Catholic organization founded by Saint Josemaría Escrivá which teaches people to seek holiness in their ordinary activities.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1980, Gómez studied at the University of Navarre, in Spain, earning his bachelor's degree and a licenciate in theology.\n\nOn August 15, 1978, Gómez was ordained a priest of Opus Dei by Cardinal Franz König at the Shrine of Torreciudad in Spain. In 1980, he obtained a Doctor of Sacred Theology from the main campus of the University of Navarre in Pamplona, Spain. He then pursued pastoral work with college and high school students in Spain and Mexico. From 1987 to 1999, Gómez was in residence at Our Lady of Grace Church in San Antonio, Texas, where he assisted in the pastoral work of the parish. During this period, he also helped in the Diocese of Galveston-Houston in Katy, Texas. He became a U.S. citizen in 1995.\n\nIn 1991, Gómez became a regional representative of the National Association of Hispanic Priests. He became its president in 1995 and served as executive director from 1999 to 2001. In 2003, he earned the annual National Association of Hispanic Priests Award, \"\"El Buen Pastor\"\". From 1997 to 1998, he served as a member-at-large on the Board of Directors for the National Catholic Council of Hispanic Ministry, and was elected its treasurer in 1999. From 1998 to 2000, he was on the steering committee for Encuentro 2000, a national celebration of the Jubilee Year 2000. Along with Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera, he played a key role in the establishment of the Hispanic Seminary of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, which opened in August 2000. He also spearheaded the establishment of Centro San Juan Diego for Family and Pastoral Care, a place for formation of lay leaders and a base to provide welcoming services to immigrants, in Denver, Colorado. In 1999, he became the vicar of Opus Dei for Texas.\n\nOn January 23, 2001, Pope John Paul II appointed Gómez auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Denver and titular bishop of Belali. He received his episcopal consecration on March 26 from Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., with Bishops Joseph Fiorenza and Javier Echevarría Rodríguez as co-consecrators. He chose as his episcopal motto \"\"Adeamus cum fiducia ad thronum gratiae\"\", meaning \"Let us confidently approach the throne of grace\" (Hebrews 4:16). He was the first numerary member of Opus Dei to be consecrated a bishop in the United States. As a bishop, he is no longer a member of that organization since he reports to the pope and thus does not answer to the prelate in charge of Opus Dei. Gomez has said he is not a \"member\" of Opus Dei, but rather that he was ordained a priest in Opus Dei and that his spirituality reflects that background.\n\nGómez served as rector of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Denver from 2001 to 2003. He next served as both moderator of the curia and pastor of Mother of God Church.\n\nGómez was appointed Archbishop of San Antonio on December 29, 2004. In 2005 he was named one of \"Time\"'s 25 most influential Hispanics in the United States, and in 2007 he was on CNN's list of \"Notable Hispanics\" in a web special celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. In 2006, Archbishop Gomez officially introduced The Catholic Community Foundation for the Roman Catholic Church of the Archdiocese of San Antonio. In 2007, he was instrumental in bringing together Hispanic leaders and Catholic bishops for the creation of the Catholic Association of Latino Leaders (CALL).\n\nDuring his tenure in San Antonio, Gómez earned a reputation as an orthodox leader who reversed some of the more liberal-leaning initiatives in the diocese. He disbanded the chancery's Justice and Peace Commission after its members expressed their opposition to his support of a state constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage. During the 2008 presidential election, he publicly expressed concern when St. Mary's University, the oldest Catholic university in Texas, allowed pro-choice candidate Hillary Clinton to hold a campaign event on campus. He also voiced concerns when another Catholic university, Our Lady of the Lake University, allowed a high-profile nun who some claim supports female ordination to be a keynote speaker at an event. He welcomed \"Summorum Pontificum\", which granted greater freedom to the Tridentine Mass, saying it would preserve \"the rich heritage and legacy of the Church\".\n\nHe is a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America in the Roman Curia and of the Board of Trustees at The Catholic University of America. As a member of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, he is chairman of the Subcommittee for the Church in Latin America; in the latter capacity, he led a three-bishop delegation to Haiti to assess the situation there following its 2010 earthquake. He is also chairman-elect of the Committee on Migration, chairman of the Task Force on the Spanish-language Bible, and a member of the Committee on Doctrine.\n\nOn April 6, 2010, Gómez was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles by Pope Benedict XVI. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles is the largest Catholic diocese in the nation, with Hispanics comprising more than two-thirds of the archdiocese's five million Catholics. Gómez succeeded Cardinal Mahony on March 1, 2011, with a transition ceremony held on February 27, 2011. He is the first Hispanic to serve as Archbishop of Los Angeles, as well as the highest-ranking Hispanic bishop in the United States. He said: \"I'm very grateful to the Holy Father for giving me this opportunity to serve the Church with a mentor and leader like Cardinal Roger Mahony. I'm grateful to the Apostolic Nuncio, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, for supporting the Holy Father's confidence in me. I will try with all my strength to earn that trust.\"\n\nConsidered theologically conservative, Gómez is also viewed as \"a natural conciliator admired for uniting rich and poor and Anglo and Hispanic Catholics\". He is regarded as more conservative than his predecessor, Cardinal Mahony. Addressing this belief, however, Mahony said that \"these labels of 'conservative' and 'liberal' are really unhelpful in the life of the church\" and \"I can attest that both of us share a common commitment to Christ and to the Church, and that both of us are interested in promoting the teachings of the Church fully as well as bringing the words and example of Christ to today's society and world.\" Gomez also said it would be wrong for observers to conclude he was a conservative because he was a priest of Opus Dei.\n\nOn September 18, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Archbishop Gómez one of the Synod Fathers for the 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization in October 2012.\n\nOn November 24, 2012 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.\n\nOn January 31, 2013, Gomez stated that Cardinal Roger Mahony, Archbishop Emeritus, would \"no longer have any administrative or public duties\" for the Los Angeles Archdiocese. The announcement came as Gomez unveiled its files related to clergy sexual abuse. He said: \"I find these files to be brutal and painful reading. The behavior described in these files is terribly sad and evil. There is no excuse, no explaining away what happened to these children. The priests involved had the duty to be their spiritual fathers and they failed. We need to acknowledge that terrible failure today.\"\n\nUnder Gómez's stewardship and with his blessing, the Queen of Angels Foundation, a public association of the faithful under canon law founded by Mark Anchor Albert, has since 2011 revived the lapsed custom of sponsoring a Marian procession and Votive Mass in commemoration of the founding of the City of Los Angeles on September 4, 1781. Since 2012 Gómez has been the principal celebrant of this annual Mass in honour of \"Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles\" (Our Lady of the Angels), patroness and namesake of the city and county of Los Angeles.\n\nOn Friday, November 14, 2014, during the fall meeting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Archbishop Gomez was elected to serve as one of the delegates to the 2015 World Synod of Bishops on the Family, pending Vatican approval.\n\nOn November 15, 2016, he was elected vice-president of the USCCB, and on November 12, 2019, he was elected President of the USCCB. He is the first Latino bishop to ever occupy the post.\n\n\n\n \n"}

He successfully defended his Australian singles title after a straight-sets victory in the final against Malcolm Anderson. In July, he won his first and only Wimbledon title after beating Fraser in the final. The pair were roommates at that year's tournament and ate breakfast together on the morning of their match. He followed up with a first singles title at the U.S. Championships, again defeating Anderson in the final.

Muller. His father was Jewish, and, as the Nazis rose to power in Germany, the family suffered increasing persecution. During Kristallnacht in 1938, his father was arrested by the Nazis. Thanks to influential friends, he was released after a short time, but this experience convinced him that he and his family had to leave Germany. His father left first, followed by the rest of the family shortly before the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. After settling briefly in England, the family immigrated to the United States in 1940 and moved to Los Angeles, where his father ran a candy store and Steven sold the Saturday Evening Post on the street. Approached by a Hollywood screenwriter on the street, Muller was introduced to moviemaking and eventually appeared in seven films, including \"The White Cliffs of Dover.\" He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1949.\n\nChoosing higher education over the movie industry, Muller graduated from UCLA in 1948 and received his Ph.D. in Government from Cornell University. From 1949 to 1951 he was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After serving in the Army Signal Corps during 1954-1955, he was an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Haverford College and Assistant Professor of Government at Cornell University. While serving as Vice President for Public Affairs of Cornell University, Muller played a leading role in negotiating the end to the occupation of Willard Straight Hall by African American students on April 20, 1969.\n\nIn 1971 Muller became Provost at JHU, under President Lincoln Gordon. Shortly after being named Provost, Gordon abruptly resigned from the Hopkins presidency, under pressure from senior faculty, and left town shortly thereafter. Milton S. Eisenhower returned to the presidency in an interim capacity, with Muller serving as Provost. In 1972 he became the University's 10th President, and thereafter was named president of Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was the first person to serve as head of both the University and the Hospital since Daniel Coit Gilman in 1889.

BYX seeks to set itself apart from other fraternities in its incorporation of cell groups where, separate from weekly fraternity meetings, small groups gather weekly to edify college men through Bible study, worship, accountability, prayer, and fellowship to promote brotherhood among members.\n\nΒΥΧ was founded at the University of Texas at Austin in 1985 by the national founding fathers, and began with the vision of Craig Albert, the first president. This group of men saw the lasting bonds of deep friendship that Greek life fostered and felt that such an order, dedicated to Christ and the edification of one another, could lead to a powerful social witness on their campus.\n\nThus, as an alternative to what was seen as the \"normal\" fraternity scene, the founding fathers of Beta Upsilon Chi established their fraternity as Brothers Under Christ, and took the Greek letters Beta, Upsilon, and Chi to identify themselves. They chose to make public their true name, Brothers Under Christ, so that they might always wear the name of Christ and demonstrate that one could remain true to one's faith and yet enjoy life in fellowship with others. To announce the founding of their fraternity, the founding fathers organized the first Island Party on the campus of the University of Texas. Chapters around the country now hold their own Island Parties annually as an evangelical outreach to the chapters' respective campuses and communities.\n\n\n\nThe process of growing from one chapter in Austin, Texas to a national organization across the country was slow at first. Initially, the alpha chapter rejected requests from Christian men at other schools to be initiated into the fraternity or to start new chapters. Eventually, the leadership in Austin decided that Beta Upsilon Chi's success should be shared with other campuses, and the founding fathers of Beta chapter were initiated at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. The fraternity then quickly expanded its presence across Texas, starting the Gamma and Delta chapters at Texas A&M University and Stephen F. Austin State University, respectively.\n\nToday the national fraternity is headquartered in Fort Worth, and an expansion program oversees the establishment of new chapters.\n\nThe influence of Beta Upsilon Chi, Brothers Under Christ, on the Christian fraternity movement has been significant. What has been characterized as the Texas movement was associated with the rise of the Evangelical Christian movement and the founding of Beta Upsilon Chi in 1985.\n\nIn 1988, only three years after BYX's founding, women from Texas established Sigma Phi Lambda, or Sisters for the Lord. Sigma Phi Lambda was influenced by BYX in their development, with Phi Lamb's establishment designed to be a \"female version of BYX.\" Their official name, Sisters for the Lord, and their system of \"cable groups\" closely mirrors BYX.\n\nWith thirty-nine chapters across the country, BYX is the largest Christian social fraternity in the United States.\n\nIn late 2006, the Pi chapter of Beta Upsilon Chi at the University of Georgia was prevented from registering as a student organization by university officials \"because the group requires its members and officers to share the group's Christian beliefs\". After months of negotiation between university officials, student officers of the local chapter, and officials at the fraternity's national headquarters in Texas, attorneys with the Christian Legal Society and Alliance Defense Fund filed a civil rights suit on December 5, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia against the University on behalf of the fraternity.\n\nFive days later, on December 10, published reports by the Associated Press indicated that the university would \"remove the religion clause from the [university's anti-discrimination] policy for the Christian fraternity to settle this particular situation and is discussing an exception to religious discrimination [that] could be put into place much like an exception to gender discrimination is in place for same-sex social fraternities and sororities.\"\n\nTen students formed a chapter at the University of Missouri, Columbia, in April 2006. In December of that year a university administrator notified them that the chapter would have to abide by campus prohibitions on discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability\" or status as a Vietnam War veteran. The students objected, with assistance from the Christian Legal Society, which sent university officials a letter listing several legal precedents protecting religious student groups' First Amendment rights of free association. In response, the university quickly reversed the directive.\n\nOn March 16, 2007, the Upsilon chapter at the University of Florida was officially recognized by the BYX national board. The University of Florida however, refused to recognize BYX. The university had refused to recognize the chapter as a registered student organization because the fraternity did not accept non-Christians, and would not recognize the chapter as a social fraternity because it was too exclusive. On July 10, 2007, the Alliance Defense Fund Center for Academic Freedom and the Christian Legal Society filed suit on behalf of BYX against various officials from the University of Florida for various constitutional violations. During the course of the legal proceedings, the 11th Circuit Court ruled that the university must recognize the chapter pending appeal. Ultimately, the case was dismissed as moot when the university amended its policies to accommodate the chapter.\n\nOn February 10, 2010 Vanderbilt school officials began an investigation into the pledgeship activities of the Nu chapter of BYX after allegations of hazing surfaced. The investigation concluded 18 days later with the chapter being allowed to resume all activities as usual. No repercussions or disciplinary actions were announced.\n\nOn November 4, 2010, two anonymous former members of the Vanderbilt chapter, an alumnus and a senior student, alleged they were evicted from the fraternity for being gay. If the allegations that individuals were expelled from BYX because of their homosexual orientation were true, then BYX could possibly be found to have violated Vanderbilt policies against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. According to the initial report in Vanderbilt's student newspaper, the \"Hustler\" (which first published the anonymous allegations), the BYX code of conduct prohibits homosexual activity by its members (along with fornication by heterosexual members).\n\nDespite the numerous reports in the student newspaper, the university's dean of students was unwilling to take action against the fraternity based upon unsubstantiated media accounts. According to published reports, the dean of students initiated a review of BYX's policies after an anonymous complaint was lodged against the fraternity in late November 2010. It was unclear what the goal of the policy review would be, since BYX's code of conduct is based upon the fraternity's \"bona fide\" religious beliefs regarding sexual chastity by all members, regardless of orientation (an issue which was already decided in the case of BYX by the Eleventh Circuit Court after the fraternity's litigation against the University of Florida). As of March 14, 2011, BYX remains an active, registered student organization at Vanderbilt and numerous other universities.\n\nAt the national level, ΒΥΧ is headed by a board of directors. This board is the ultimate authority in the fraternity and is responsible for the guidance of the fraternity.\n\nThe board also comprises the governing body of the Beta Upsilon Chi corporation, a 501(c)(3) organization, which controls the assets of the fraternity. They appoint the national executive director to run the fraternity's daily business. In conjunction with this executive director, they approve any charter changes.\n\nAll members of the board of directors must be alumni of the fraternity, and new members are appointed from the board of advisors. The current members of the national board of directors are:\n\nThe Board of directors is assisted in its governance of the fraternity by a board of advisors. This board serves as a consultative partner of the board of directors, with voice but no vote in the directors' decisions.\n\nBoard of advisors members are appointed by the board of directors, in consultation with the national executive director. All members of the board of advisors must be alumni of the fraternity, and only alumni of chartered chapters may be appointed to the board. The current members of the National Board of Advisors are:\n\n\nThe BYX executive director is the fraternity's national administrator. Through his staff, he coordinates the activities of the fraternity from its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. The executive director's staff is equally responsible for the day-to-day operation of the national fraternity, and staff from National Headquarters frequently visit the chapters. The national executive director is an \"ex officio\" member of the board of directors; he has a voice in decisions, but no vote.\n\nThe following men have served as executive director of Beta Upsilon Chi:\n\nChapters are authorized by a charter from the National Board of Directors and denominated by a letter of the Greek alphabet that corresponds with their order of admission into the fraternity (for example, the University of Texas is Alpha chapter).\n\nThe charter authorizes each chapter to work under a chapter constitution that provides for the election of chapter officers: typically a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, chaplain, and a pledge trainer, sometimes called a New Member Captain.\nThese officers are responsible for the administration of the chapter for a calendar year, including conducting ritual, overseeing meetings, organizing trips, implementing the pledging program, and organizing parties. The officers serve one-year terms, and may be re-elected only once to a different office.\n\nIn the beginnings, once each year, the chapter officers gather together for a National Leadership Conference, which consists of all the officers of the fraternity and the national staff. This meeting is in the fall, and shortly follows the election of the local chapter leaders.\n\nIn the early spring of even-numbered years, the entire fraternity is called together for National Summit, typically held outside of Dallas, Texas. The event is the primary unifying experience of BYX members outside of their common commitment to Christ and their shared experience in ritual and ceremony of the fraternity. Its Bible studies, worship, fellowship, athletic competitions, and seminars on fraternity issues attract the largest gatherings of Brothers Under Christ in any given year. It is also at Summit where the fraternity's annual Delegate Convention takes place.\n\nSince its inception in 1985, chapters of Beta Upsilon Chi have chosen not to affiliate with the Interfraternity Council (IFC) at the school where they are established. This has proven controversial on some campuses, because it means that BYX does not pay IFC dues. On the other hand, IFC membership sometimes involves sanctioning rules and regulations which would be contrary to the purpose of BYX. Because of the potential for conflict inherent in such affiliations, the National Board of Directors continues to uphold a policy prohibiting local chapters from affiliating with host university IFCs. As a result, depending on the university, each chapter is either registered as a social fraternity unassociated with the IFC, or as a student organization. The Alpha Eta chapter at Clemson University, the Omicron chapter at Mississippi State University, and the Pi chapter at the University of Georgia are exceptions, affiliating with their local IFCs in 2014, 2015, and 2017 respectively.\n\nOn a national basis, Beta Upsilon Chi became a member of the NIC on 22 Sept 2016, to \"align itself with the fraternal movement \" and access advocacy and resources that will elevate its value in higher education, said Jason Hoyt, Beta Upsilon Chi President and COO.\n\nThere are three kinds of membership in the Fraternity: pledges, active members, and alumni members. Each local chapter is composed of its active members and pledges.\n\nActive members form the backbone of the fraternity, participating in ritual, leading worship, Bible study, and other chapter activities. Active members have voting rights within the chapter and become alumni members upon their graduation. Pledges become members by finishing the pledging process, a process that differs from chapter to chapter, but typically lasts a semester.\n\nThe attribute of BYX chapters that most clearly delineates it from other Christian fraternities—and certainly from non-Christian social fraternities—is that all BYX members are a part of \"cell groups.\" Cell groups were an original innovation of the founding fathers when they established the fraternity at the University of Texas. These weekly meetings bring four to six brothers (and pledges, when there are pledges) together into a group for close fellowship, Christian accountability, and Bible study. Many times, brothers in Beta Upsilon Chi find that those with whom they share their cell group become their closest friends within the chapter and within their college.\n\nThe overall strength of the fraternity's national and local unity is firmly rooted in this cell group structure, and their foundational place within Beta Upsilon Chi has led to its continued growth and longevity. Indeed, cell groups are one of the primary means by which the fraternity's Christian character is maintained.\n\nMost Beta Upsilon Chi chapters host between two and four parties a semester. Parties are meant to be a way for members to fellowship with other members, as well as witness to those who are not members of the organization. This is done through a testimony by one of the members of BYX during the event. Official BYX parties are always \"all campus, no alcohol.\"\n\nLike other fraternities, BYX usually hosts one or two formals per semester for their members. Unlike parties, formals are by invitation only, meaning only members and their invited dates are open to attend.\n\nBYX chapters hold one weekend retreat a semester. The retreats are held off-campus, usually in a rural or remote location, and are meant to be a way for members to fellowship, have quiet time, and pray away from the stresses of college and university life.\n\nAs with any Greek letter organization, Beta Upsilon Chi is a ritualistic organization whose pledge induction, initiation, and other ceremonies are esoteric and not open to the general public. Instead, these traditions serve to bind the brothers together such that any Brother Under Christ from across the country can feel welcome and among his brothers.\n\nIn addition to the usual Greek practices of grips, words, and memory work, Beta Upsilon Chi also utilizes several symbols whose meaning is open to anyone:\n\n\nBeta Upsilon Chi changed its policy regarding expansion of chapters in February 2009. The fraternity's board of directors, in consultation with its board of advisors, continued the implementation of a three-phased expansion progress for prospective chapters to pursue active chapter status, but the national leadership began actively recruiting individuals to establish BYX chapters on those campuses which do not already have them.\n\nThe fraternity is currently composed of thirty-eight active chapters\n\n"}

The town lies at the edge of the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region on the bank of the Main. It lies east of Frankfurt am Main. In the north is found the town of Hanau (Main-Kinzig-Kreis). Hainburg lies in the southern part of Hesse and borders in the east on the state of Bavaria.\n\nHainburg borders in the north on the town of Hanau and the community of Großkrotzenburg (both in the Main-Kinzig-Kreis), in the east on the communities of Kahl and Karlstein (both in the Aschaffenburg district in Bavaria), in the south on the town of Seligenstadt and in the west on the towns of Rodgau and Obertshausen.\n\nThe municipal area stretches over just under 16 km².\n\nHainburg am Main is, with regards to transport, well linked to the surrounding towns and communities.\n\nHainburg's two \"Ortsteile\" are Hainstadt and Klein-Krotzenburg, with the latter's population being about 2,000 fewer than the former's.\n\nNear Hainstadt are preserved the remains of a Roman settlement. It is, however, questionable whether there was continuous settlement here between the time when this was built and the 12th century, when Hainstadt had its first documentary mention.\nWhen Gottfried of Eppstein sold Electoral Mainz the \"Amt\" of Steinheim with all the places belonging thereto in 1425, the Electors and Archbishops of Mainz took over as the new landlords. In 1532, the compulsory labour that Hainstadt people would ordinarily have to have done was cast aside in favour of payments in money.\n\nWhen the Auheimer Mark (an old cadastral unit) was partitioned in 1786, Hainstadt was given part of the \"Markwald\" (common forest). After Electoral Mainz's Secularization, the \"Oberamt\" of Steinheim passed in 1803 to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1882, the Hanau-Eberbach railway with a railway station in Hainstadt was opened.\n\nOn 1 January 1977, in the course of municipal reform in Hesse, Hainstadt was merged with the neighbouring community of Klein-Krotzenburg under the name Hainburg.\n\n\"Cutzenburch\" had its first documentary mention in 1175 in a legal battle between the Seligenstadt Abbey and Saint Peter's Monastery in Mainz. The Seligenstadt Abbey at this time had extensive landholdings in Krotzenburg. Already by this time, the Prince-Elector-Archbishop of Mainz was the landlord in Klein-Krotzenburg.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, the populace suffered mightily. In 1632 alone, 90 inhabitants died of the Plague. By the war's end, everyone had fled the village.\n\nIn 1736, a chapel was built on the \"Liebfrauenheide\" (heath), which soon became a pilgrimage site. After Electoral Mainz's Secularization, the \"Oberamt\" of Steinheim passed in 1803 to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, bringing Klein-Krotzenburg with it.\n\nOn 1 January 1977, in the course of municipal reform in Hesse, Klein-Krotzenburg was merged with the neighbouring community of Hainstadt under the name Hainburg.\n\nThe municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:\nThe current mayor, Bernhard Bessel (CDU), who has been in office since 1993, was reëlected on 12 September 2004 for a third term on the first vote with 64.8% of the ballots cast. Voter turnout was 59.1%.\n\n\nIn 1975, the community took on the sponsorship for Sudeten Germans driven out of the communities of Peterswald (now Petrovice u Chabařovic) and Nollendorf (now Nakléřov) in the Aussig district.\n\nThe constituent community of Hainstadt lies on the \"Odenwaldbahn\" (railway; RMV Line 65), which links the community to Hanau, Frankfurt, Wiebelsbach-Heubach and Erbach.\n\nTowards the west runs the \"Offenbacher Landstraße\" or \"Landesstraße\" 3416 to \"Bundesstraße\" 45 and the A 3. Northwards, \"Landesstraße\" 3065 goes towards Hanau, and southwards towards Seligenstadt.\n\n"}

The festival includes the Easter procession which sees \"Sun Loong\", the longest imperial dragon in the world, dance through the streets.\n\nThe first Bendigo Easter Fair was instigated by Committee Members, Messrs. Burnside and Aspinal, to raise funds for the Sandhurst Benevolent Asylum and Hospital. The first fair was held in 1871, raising over £1000 . The community considered the fair a success and thus it has been held every year since, making it Australia's longest continuous running festival. The festival is held every Easter and throughout its history has varied from one to ten days in duration.\n\nIn 1893 reports in \"The Weekly Advertiser\" describe a procession which included a large and colourful Chinese section that delighted crowds. Since then the Chinese community has supported and been an integral part of the festival, complementing their award-winning museum and Chinese Precinct in Bridge Street. In the early 1800s, Chinese gold hunters were persecuted in the district. Bendigo residents today hold their Chinese Community in the highest esteem. At time of writing, the procession features upwards of 100 floats entered by local community groups, schools, emergency services and businesses. The procession traditionally ends with the large Chinese section, which has grown to showcase over one thousand elements and participants. Chinese cultural groups from Bendigo and Melbourne participate in the parade, demonstrating lion and dragon dances. The procession was normally held on Easter Monday each year but since 2011, when it clashed with Anzac Day, it has been held on Easter Sunday. From 1978, Bendigo Easter Processions and events have been attended by a team of radio-equipped marshals, assembled solely for the purpose of improving Festival logistical aspects. Originally formed at the suggestion of Easter Fair Committee member Jim Dobbyn, the Easter Fair Marshals (EFMs) improved entry movements and reduced parade gaps. By the early 1990s, EFMs had evolved into a separate, incorporated entity known as The Dragon City Marshals Inc. (DCMs), with a much wider geographical sphere of activity. By 1994 DCMs were assisting many other festivals and events around Victoria, including Melbourne's famous \"Moomba\" Festival.\n\nThe torchlight procession is a night-time parade which began before 1900. It features local emergency services, with local volunteer and professional fire brigade members marching with flaming brass torches. In recent times the parade has ended at Lake Weeroona where entertainment, activities and fireworks have been held. The torchlight procession is held on Easter Saturday each year.\n\nA fund raising event called the \"Popular Girl\" was held in which well-known local women raised money for charity and in doing so gained \"votes\". The woman who raised the largest number of votes was crowned as the Popular Girl. The competition is no longer held. The 2010 parade contained a section in which a number of past Popular Girls paraded once again.\n\nOriginally held in several locations, including Rosalind Park, Bendigo Showgrounds and, more recently, the Bendigo Central Business District, the carnival features a large number of \"sideshow alley\" attractions and children's rides.\n\nThe Chinese Spring Festival has been held every Easter Sunday in the Yi Yuan Gardens since 1996. The festival includes many cultural performers who demonstrate martial arts, lion dancing, storytelling and traditional Chinese dancing which includes; the fan dance (Chinese), ribbon dance and drum dance.\n\nThis ceremony is unique to Bendigo. A lot of noise is required to awaken Sun Loong who will slowly rouse himself from his year-long slumber to walk in the Gala Parade. In order to do this the famous Southern Lions perform accompanied by the clash of cymbals and the beating of drums. This culminates in the explosion of tens of thousands of firecrackers. Also during this ceremony the Bendigo Chinese Association Lion Team perform the donation dance. This is another unique ceremony to Bendigo's Chinese community. The donation dance began as a way for the Bendigo Chinese community to raise money for the local hospitals and benevolent societies.\n\nThe Bendigo Easter Fair was renamed as the Bendigo Easter Festival in 2001. It is still a very popular event attracting over 100,000 people across the three-day event.\n\n"}

A stochastic process is reversible if the statistical properties of the process are the same as the statistical properties for time-reversed data from the same process.\n\nIn mathematics, a dynamical system is time-reversible if the forward evolution is one-to-one, so that for every state there exists a transformation (an involution) π which gives a one-to-one mapping between the time-reversed evolution of any one state and the forward-time evolution of another corresponding state, given by the operator equation:\n\nAny time-independent structures (e.g. critical points or attractors) which the dynamics give rise to must therefore either be self-symmetrical or have symmetrical images under the involution π.\n\nIn physics, the laws of motion of classical mechanics exhibit time reversibility, as long as the operator π reverses the conjugate momenta of all the particles of the system, i.e. formula_2 (T-symmetry).\n\nIn quantum mechanical systems, however, the weak nuclear force is not invariant under T-symmetry alone; if weak interactions are present reversible dynamics are still possible, but only if the operator π also reverses the signs of all the charges and the parity of the spatial co-ordinates (C-symmetry and P-symmetry). This reversibility of several linked properties is known as CPT symmetry.\n\nThermodynamic processes can be reversible or irreversible, depending on the change in entropy during the process.\n\nA stochastic process is time-reversible if the joint probabilities of the forward and reverse state sequences are the same for all sets of time increments { \"τ\" }, for \"s\" = 1, ..., \"k\" for any \"k\":\n\nA univariate stationary Gaussian process is time-reversible. Markov processes can only be reversible if their stationary distributions have the property of detailed balance:\n\nKolmogorov's criterion defines the condition for a Markov chain or continuous-time Markov chain to be time-reversible.\n\nTime reversal of numerous classes of stochastic processes has been studied, including Lévy processes, stochastic networks (Kelly's lemma), birth and death processes, Markov chains, and piecewise deterministic Markov processes.\n\nTime reversal method works based on the linear reciprocity of the wave equation, which states that the time reversed solution of a wave equation is also a solution to the wave equation since standard wave equations only contain even derivatives of the unknown variables. Thus, the wave equation is symmetrical under time reversal, so the time reversal of any valid solution is also a solution. This means that a wave's path through space is valid when travelled in either direction.\n\nTime reversal signal processing is a process in which this property is used to reverse a received signal; this signal is then re-emitted and a temporal compression occurs, resulting in a reverse of the initial excitation waveform being played at the initial source.\n\n"}

He grew up in Westbury, New York.\n\nAfter playing at St. John Fisher College, Hewitt coached the Siena College men's college basketball team for three years, from 1998 to 2000. He led Siena to their first Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference title game appearance, and coached Siena into the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament.\n\nGeorgia Tech's success under Hewitt came as no surprise. Prior to his arrival in Atlanta, he posted a 66–27 mark as the head coach at Siena. At the Loudonville, N.Y., school, Hewitt revived a program that had been dormant since the mid-1990s and molded it into one of the best in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and among the best in the Northeast.\n\nIn three seasons at Siena, Hewitt developed one of the nation's highest scoring teams. Siena ranked third nationally in scoring each of his last two seasons there, and in three seasons the team averaged 85.6 points per game while shooting 38.1 percent from three-point range and 77.8 percent from the foul line.\n\nFollowing a three-year stretch in which Siena won just 22 games, Hewitt guided a young Saints team to a 17–12 overall record in his first season, including a 10–8 mark in the MAAC and the school's first-ever berth in the MAAC Tournament title game. In his second year, Siena went 25–6 and earned the school's first-ever MAAC Tournament Championship and its first appearance in the NCAA Tournament since 1989.\n\nHewitt guided the Saints to their first-ever outright conference regular-season title in 2000. Siena finished the season with a 24–9 overall mark and a MAAC-best 15–3 slate. He directed the Saints to their third consecutive MAAC Championship game appearance, and second consecutive postseason berth with a bid to the NIT.\n\nHewitt was head coach of the Georgia Tech men's college basketball team from 2000 to 2011. He was released in March 2011.\n\nDuring the 2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, he led them to the championship game against Connecticut. In 2005, he signed a contract extension, giving him a new six-year contract. On March 12, 2011, he was let go from his head coaching position at Georgia Tech with a $7.2 million buyout.\nNamed Georgia Tech's 12th head basketball coach on April 6, 2000, Paul Hewitt was given the task of restoring its basketball program to the level it achieved in the 1980s and early '90s with 10 NCAA Tournament appearances and three Atlantic Coast Conference championships.\n\nIn 11 seasons under Hewitt, Tech went to the NCAA Tournament five times, played for a national championship, played for two ACC championships, advanced to the Postseason NIT quarterfinals and won the Preseason NIT. He would only finish with one winning ACC season in those 11 years which would lead to his eventual dismissal.\n\nHewitt compiled a record of 190–162 at Tech, and his overall record as a head coach is 256–189, with eight post-season appearances in 14 years. Hewitt expanded his experience by twice serving as an assistant coach for USA Basketball's Under-18 team at the FIBA Americas U18 Championship, helping the U.S. win a gold medal each time. He was named head coach for the 2011 USA Basketball Under-19 team. He finished his Tech career third among active coaches in the ACC in games coached and fourth in career victories. He ranks 17th in career victories all-time.\nBorn in Jamaica and reared on New York's Long Island, Hewitt received his highest accolades for guiding the Yellow Jackets to the NCAA in his very first season in 2001, and for taking them within one win of a national championship three years later in 2004. That season, Hewitt went to work with a team that had lost its two best rebounders, including Chris Bosh, who left Tech after one season to play in the NBA. Despite preseason predictions that had Tech finishing no better than seventh in the ACC, the Yellow Jackets started 12–0 and finished 28–10, tying a school record for victories in a season.\n\nAlong the way, Tech won the Preseason NIT, and in the process defeated a team ranked No. 1 in the country (Connecticut) for the first time in 11 years. Tech achieved its highest ACC regular season finish in eight years (a tie for third at 9–7). The Yellow Jackets, who posted a 9–6 record against Top 25 teams, defeated Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium to end a 41-game homecourt winning streak for the Blue Devils, and won at Wake Forest to snap a 24-game streak at home for the Demon Deacons.\n\nTech's success led to Hewitt receiving the Fritz Pollard Coach of the Year award by the Black College Coaches Association. He also was listed at No. 71 among the nation's 101 top minorities in sports by \"Sports Illustrated\". Only 15 figures in college athletics, and only four men's basketball coaches, made that list.\n\nThough Tech dealt with a number of injuries to key players the following season, Hewitt again guided the Yellow Jackets to a strong finish, tying for fourth place in the regular season and advancing to the championship game of the ACC Tournament, a first for the Jackets under Hewitt. Tech earned its third NCAA bid under Hewitt, and fourth post-season bid overall, and won its first-round game before being eliminated by Louisville. He guided Jackets back to the Big Dance in 2007 despite losing the team's top scorer in December.\nIn 2010, despite a strong reliance on four freshmen in his eight-man rotation, Hewitt guided the Jackets to their fourth NCAA Tournament, winning 23 games overall. Tech won three games in the ACC Tournament and lost a close game to Duke in the finals, and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Midwest Regional.\n\nIn his very first season on the Flats, despite the prevailing pre-season opinions that had Tech finishing no better than eighth in the ACC and gave the Jackets little chance for a winning record, Hewitt guided a veteran squad with five seniors to an 8–8 record and a fifth-place finish in the nation's toughest conference. Tech's 17–13 record marked its first winning season since 1998, and the Jackets won their first ACC Tournament game and earned their first trip to the Big Dance since 1996.\n\nHewitt was recognized as the ACC Coach of the Year, only the second time in league history that a first-year coach had won the award. He was also named District 5 Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and was a finalist for the Naismith College Coach of the Year Award. Six of his players have earned first- or second-team All-ACC honors, including Iman Shumpert (second team in 2011), Jarrett Jack (second team in 2005), B.J. Elder (second team in 2004), Bosh (second team in 2003), Tony Akins (second team in 2002) and Alvin Jones (first team in 2001).\n\nThe recruiting efforts of Hewitt and his staff also resulted in strong contributions from Tech's players early in their careers as well. Three Tech players were named ACC Rookie of the Year, including Derrick Favors in 2010, Chris Bosh in 2003 and Ed Nelson in 2002. Seven players were named to the league's all-freshman team under Hewitt.\n\nSeveral Tech players under Hewitt have gone on to play basketball professionally, including first-round draft picks Derrick Favors, the third overall pick by New Jersey in 2010; Chris Bosh, an NBA lottery choice in 2003 who is now with the Miami Heat; Jack, a first-round pick in 2005 now a point guard for the New Orleans Hornets; Thaddeus Young (Brooklyn) and Javaris Crittenton (Memphis), first-round choices in 2007; and Alvin Jones, a second-round choice in 2001 who spent time with the Philadelphia 76ers. Will Bynum (Washington) recently completed his eight season in the NBA. Luke Schenscher, as well as former walk-on Mario West, have spent time on NBA rosters, while four-year player Anthony Morrow, led the NBA in three-point shooting as a rookie and is currently active with Oklahoma City. Others like Akins, B.J. Elder, Shaun Fein, Anthony McHenry and Isma'il Muhammad continue to play pro basketball abroad.\n\nThree of his assistant coaches became head coaches—Dean Keener at James Madison, Cliff Warren at Jacksonville and John O'Connor at Holy Family in Philadelphia—while three players became assistants (Jon Babul at James Madison, Darryl LaBarrie at Campbell, East Carolina and Georgia Tech - currently at Georgia State and Winston Neal at Jacksonville - currently the head coach at Columbia State College).\n\nSince the 1996-1997 season, Tech basketball has posted four seasons of .500 or better in league play, all under Hewitt. They also appeared in two ACC tournament finals (2005 & 2010). On March 12, 2011, Paul Hewitt was dismissed as the head coach of the Georgia Tech after eleven seasons as head coach.\n\nHewitt has served in USA Basketball on several occasions. In 2006 and 2010, he was an assistant coach with the Under-18 team. Both won gold medals in the Championship of the Americas. He was also the head coach of the U.S. Under-19 squad at the 2011 FIBA Under-19 World Championship. The team came in 5th place.\n\nOn April 30, 2011, Hewitt was named the 9th head men's basketball coach in the programs history at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. He succeeded previous head coach Jim Larranaga after Larranaga accepted a head coaching job at the University of Miami.\n\nIn his first year, George Mason returned 3 senior starters from an NCAA tournament team that had beaten Villanova and was picked to finish second in the conference. Hewitt led the Patriots to a 24–9 record, including a 14–4 mark and 3rd-place finish in CAA play. Senior Ryan Pearson was named the CAA Player of the Year, just the third Patriot to earn the honor.\n\nIn his second season as the head men's basketball coach Hewitt guided the Patriots to a 22–16 mark, including a 10–8 conference record. For the second year in a row Hewitt's team did not receive an NCAA or NIT invitation, but played instead in the College Basketball Invitation where it finished as runner-up losing in the championship game to Santa Clara. Junior guard Sherrod Wright was named to the All-State and All-CAA second teams.\n\nIn his third season, George Mason moved to the basketball-centric Atlantic-10 conference. Hewitt led his team to an 11–20 mark (4–12 in Atlantic 10). No Patriot players were named to the all conference team.\n\nIn his fourth season at George Mason, the Patriots were 9–22 record (4–14 in Atlantic 10). After being eliminated from the Atlantic 10 tournament in the first round for the second year in a row, Hewitt was fired on March 16, 2015. Since his firing at George Mason, Hewitt has remained active in the coaching and broadcasting profession. He served as Vice President of the NABC Board of Directors. In September 2016, It was announced that Hewitt had joined the staff of the Los Angeles Clippers as a scout.\n\n\n"}

It was written by showrunner Manny Coto, and directed by Allan Kroeker. The episode featured the return of the Orion slave girls, which had been originally seen in the original pilot of \"\", \"\".\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. In this episode, three Orion slave girls come on board the ship, and the crew, with the exception of Commander \"Trip\" Tucker and Commander T'Pol who seem to have a resistant psychic bond, begin acting strangely.\n\nThe episode featured the return of Cyia Batten and William Lucking who had both previously appeared in multi-episode parts in \"\". Four time MTV Music Video Award for Choreography winner Travis Payne was brought on board to oversee the extensive choreography for the three actresses playing the Orion women. Each actress went through a four to five-hour make-up process for each day of filming, which required them to be sprayed green. \"Bound\" received Nielsen ratings of 1.8/3%, and critical reaction was mixed with one reviewer listing it amongst the best episodes of \"Enterprise\" while another listed as the worst episode ever of any \"Star Trek\" series.\n\n\"Enterprise\" is en route to the Berengarius system, one of the proposed locations for a Starfleet starbase, when it is approached by an Orion Syndicate vessel. Captain Archer is invited to visit the Orion ship by its captain, Harrad-Sar. During the visit, Archer and Lieutenant Reed are entertained by three Orion dancers, Navaar, D'Nesh, and Maras. Archer negotiates with Harrad-Sar and they agree to a joint magnesite mining operation, and at Harrad-Sar's insistence the three slaves are given to him. They return to \"Enterprise\" with the slaves and set a course to survey the planet.\n\nEn route, the presence of the Orions begins having an effect on the crew: men become increasingly aggressive, while women increasingly suffer from headaches. Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor Phlox determines that the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline levels to spike. Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected, since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.\n\nThe Orions are placed under guard in the decontamination chamber. Harrad-Sar returns in his vessel and attacks the now disabled \"Enterprise\", and then begins to tow it away. He reveals that, in fact, the Syndicate seeks Archer's head, and in this matter he is the slave and the Orion women are his masters. The Orions escape and travel to the Bridge, as do T'Pol and Tucker. Navaar tells Archer to arrest T'Pol, but Tucker stuns all the male crew-members with his phaser, and T'Pol disables the Orion ship with a pulse sent from \"Enterprise\" deflector dish. They send the Orions back to their ship, and T'Pol finally admits she would personally like Tucker to return, and he replies that he has already requested a transfer back to \"Enterprise\".\n\nThe Orion slave girls had been introduced in the original \"\" pilot \"\", footage from which was later adapted to appear in the episode \"\". The make-up was designed by Fred Phillips, which was originally tested on Majel Barrett, before it was applied to Susan Oliver. Cyia Batten, Crystal Allen and Menina Fortunato played the three Orion women in \"Bound\". Batten had previously appeared as Tora Ziyal, the daughter of Gul Dukat in \"\" in the episodes \"Indiscretion\" and \"Return to Grace\". She also appeared in \"\", an episode \"\", as Irina. William Lucking had appeared as a Bajoran called Furel in three episodes of \"Deep Space Nine\"; \"Shakaar\", \"\" and \"Ties of Blood and Water\". Derek Magyar returned as Commander Kelby, following his introduction earlier in the previous episode \"\".\n\nAllen recalled \"The Original Series\", and said that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl. However, she was not pleased with the make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The make-up team also needed to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.\n\nAllan Kroeker, the director of \"Bound\", had previously directed two episodes earlier in the season, \"\" and \"\". Fortunato praised the director and described the Orions, saying that they \"move very slowly, very seductively. I would like to compare us to snakes – we like to slither and creep around, versus a human. So we’re a little sneaky. The three of us are trying to get something accomplished, and each one of us has our target, so to speak, to try to manipulate them to get what we want in the end.\"\n\nThe choreography was overseen by Travis Payne, who had won the MTV Music Video Award for Best Choreography on four occasions and worked with Madonna, Michael Jackson and Britney Spears amongst others. Both Batten and Fortunato were trained dancers, with Batten being a former member of The Pussycat Dolls burlesque dance troupe, while Allen had previously appeared in films such as \"Maid in Manhattan\" and television series such as \"Boston Legal\" alongside William Shatner. After being cast, Fortunato said that the actresses playing the Orion women were not shown any film footage of the previous appearances of Orion slave girls, but were allowed to see a magazine article about Bobbi Sue Luther appearing as one in the episode \"\" in order to demonstrate what the make-up would look like.\n\nFilming began on January 6, 2005 and concluded on January 14. Only six days were used to shoot, with January 10 spent working on choreography for the dance scene and for shooting additional footage for \"\". Filming on the earlier episode had also overlapped on the first day of filming. While the actresses playing the Orion women were required on all days, Lucking filmed all his scenes on the final day of shooting. The main cabin of the Orion ship was constructed in full specifically for this episode while the bridge was only a single wall as it was only seen on screen as a viewscreen background.\n\n\"Bound\" was first aired in the United States on UPN on April 15, 2005. It received a 1.8/3% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 1.8 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was lower than the following episode, where the first installment of the two-part \"In a Mirror, Darkly\" received ratings of 2.0/3%.\n\nThe critical response was mixed. James Hunt of the website Den of Geek listed \"Bound\" as the fourth best episode of \"Enterprise\", saying that it \"found a way to include [the Orion slave girls] in a way that preserved the eye candy and shifted the power in the Orion relationships.\" However, Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website \"Jammer's Reviews\" gave \"Bound\" a score of one out of four, saying that it was \"too dumb, too obvious, too boring, and too rooted in gender stereotypes\". He said that it was sexist and \"the worst episode of Enterprise in more than two years\". Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation said that it was the single worst episode of any \"Star Trek\" series, including \"Spock's Brain\". She considered it a statement in misogyny and also thought that it represented a scenario where homosexual characters do not exist.\n\n\"Bound\" was released on home media in the United States on November 1, 2005, as part of the season four DVD box set of \"Enterprise\". The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.\n\n"}

It originally aired on February 25, 2005 in the United States on UPN. It was the fourth episode of \"Enterprise\" to be written by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, and was the first episode of a \"Star Trek\" series directed by David Barrett. \"Divergence\" is the second part of a two part story, following on from \"\".\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. In this episode, \"Columbia\" arrives so that Commander Tucker can be transferred to conduct repairs on \"Enterprise\"s warp engine before it overloads. The two ships then pursue a lead to a Klingon research outpost where Phlox is under pressure to cure the virus that the Klingons created from augmented human DNA.\n\nFilming took eight days, with a two-week seasonal hiatus towards the end of December. In addition to the guest stars who appeared in \"Affliction\", they were joined by Wayne Grace as Admiral Krell. The episode received Nielsen ratings of 1.7/3 percent, which were lower than the previous week's episode. The critical response was negative, directed mainly at plot holes and characterisation. However, the two part story has been named as one of the best storylines seen in \"Enterprise\".\n\nWith the ship unable to decrease speed below warp 5, and the warp core reaching dangerous levels, \"Columbia\" and Commander Tucker rendezvous to provide assistance. However the crew realise that the transporter cannot be used at warp, so the ships will need to maneuver in close proximity in order for Tucker to be transferred. Captain Archer releases Lieutenant Reed from the brig to perform the transfer. Once on \"Enterprise\", Tucker successfully performs a rapid non-standard cold boot on the warp engine, which purges the Klingon subroutines.\n\nMeanwhile, physician Antaak and a badly beaten Doctor Phlox update General K'Vagh on their progress. K'Vagh contacts Admiral Krell, who tells him that if a cure is not completed soon, the facility will be eradicated in order to contain the disease. Back on \"Enterprise\", Archer questions Reed about his recent actions, and is contacted by Harris from Section 31, a secretive agency within Starfleet. Harris reveals that Phlox is on an important mission and little else, but Reed reveals his location as Qu'Vat; Harris contacts Krell, to inform him that \"Enterprise\" is on the way, and Krell reveals that he used Harris. \"Enterprise\" arrives at the colony, and Archer beams down to the base with Marab to confront the Klingons and Phlox.\n\nKrell's Klingon battlecruiser and two Birds of Prey arrive in orbit and Krell orders the ships to destroy the colony. \"Enterprise\" attempts to intervene but is engaged by the Birds of Prey. \"Columbia\" arrives and joins combat with the two Birds of Prey, while \"Enterprise\" impedes the battlecruiser. Meanwhile, Phlox infects a voluntarily restrained Archer, as he needs human antibodies for the cure. Antaak then transports a canister of the virus onto the battlecruiser which infects the crew, including Krell. Needing the cure from Phlox, Krell stands down the attack and the Klingon High Council soon agrees to distribute the cure throughout the Empire. Tucker then agrees to remain onboard temporarily to assist with repairs.\n\nHarris contacts Reed, thanking him and confirming that the plan proceeded as per Section 31's projections, stabilizing the leadership of the Klingon Empire while scaring it off from augment experimentation.\n\nFilming began on December 14, 2004 and ran for four days before the cast and crew went on a two-week break over the holiday period. The production overlapped on December 16 with second-unit filming on the episode \"\", which required most of the main cast with the exception of Billingsley as Phlox. The opportunity was taken to film the majority of the sequences with Phlox, K'Vagh and Antaak at the same time on a different sound stage so as to not delay the production. After the break, production resumed on January 3, 2005. Minimal shooting was conducted on the first day for \"Divergence\", as further second-unit filming took place in the afternoon for \"United\" and for \"Babel One\". On the second day, Eric Pierpoint and Wayne Grace filmed their scenes as they both appeared on only one set each. Whilst filming was scheduled for seven days, the second-unit filming for \"Divergence\" pushed into an eighth day on January 6, which overlapped with the production of \"\".\n\nJudith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens joined the staff as writers during season four. Prior to \"Divergence\" they had already written the episodes \"\", \"\" and \"United\". The Reeves-Stevens said of \"Divergence\", \"we've written a multiple-starship action sequence that's never been seen before, and that everyone's very excited to bring to the screen.\" \"Divergence\" was the first \"Star Trek\" credit for director David Barrett. Several guest cast members resume their roles from \"Affliction\", including James Avery as K'Vagh, John Schuck as Antaak, Terrell Tilford as Marab and Eric Pierpoint as Harris. They were joined in \"Divergence\" by Wayne Grace as Krell. Grace had previously appeared across the franchise including in a voice role in the computer game \"\", a Cardassian in the \"\" episode \"Wrongs Darker Than Death or Night\" and as the Klingon Governor Torak in \"\"s \"Aquiel\". Kristin Bauer made her franchise debut as Laneth. She later became better known in her appearances as Pam in HBO's \"True Blood\".\n\n\"Divergence\" originally aired on UPN, on February 25, 2005. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode received a 1.7/3 percent share. This means that it was seen by 1.7 percent of the population, and 3 percent of all viewers watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was less than the ratings received by the previous episode, \"Affliction\", which scored ratings of 1.8/3 percent. It finished behind programs on NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox as well as \"What I Like About You\" and a repeat of \"Reba\" during the second half-hour on The WB.\n\nMichelle Erica Green, in her review for TrekNation, said that it wasn't as good as the previous episode and thought that there were plot holes. She felt that some of the episode featured bad science, such as when Tucker was transferred between the two ships. She also criticised Archer going down to the Klingon base on his own, calling him a \"putz\" and said of the Klingon attack, \"since when do Klingons destroy ships with deadly subroutines rather than, you know, BOMBS?\" She thought the characterisation was forced, and wanted a better resolution to the events in \"Affliction\" which she had called \"one of the greatest hours of \"Star Trek\" ever\". Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website \"Jammer's Reviews\", gave the episode a score of two out of four, saying that the battle scenes were \"painfully routine\" and that where the episode \"runs off the rails is in these final 10 minutes\". He felt that it was a pattern of the final episodes in story arcs not having a \"satisfying finish\" and that \"Divergence\" followed in this pattern set by \"The Augments\" and \"The Aenar\". The two part story in \"Affliction\" and \"Divergence\" were subsequently ranked the fifth best story of \"Enterprise\" by \"Den of Geek\" writer James Hunt.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with some of the show's cast with SyFy, this episode was a recommended favorite of theirs.\n\nThe first home media release of the episode was on DVD as part of the season four box set. This was released in the UK on October 31, 2005, and on November 1, 2005 in the United States. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.\n\n"}

Vain set Australian prize money records as a two-year-old and three-year-old.\nHis only defeat as a three year old was against the champion New Zealand colt Daryl's Joy, who also won the W S Cox Plate and Victoria Derby and who later raced successfully in the United States as a stayer including winning at group one level.\n\nHe was retired to stud at the end of his three-year-old season, in 1970, when he was injured in a track gallop. He was placed at Widden Stud in the Hunter Region, where he sired 370 winners, among them winning almost 1,800 races. Vain sired two Golden Slipper winners and was a leading sire in Australia. He is also the great-great grand-sire of Black Caviar on the dam side (as the sire of Song of Norway-1982, the great grand-sire of Black Caviar) and the great grand-sire of Black Caviar on the sire side (as the sire of Bespoken-1990, the grand-sire of Black Caviar).\n\nVain sired 44 stakes winners that had 96 stakes wins, including: \n\nVain died on 25 December 1991.

{"id": "1937695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937695", "title": "Tordesillas", "text": "Tordesillas\n\nTordesillas () is a town and municipality in the province of Valladolid, Castile and León, central Spain. \nIt is located southwest of the provincial capital, Valladolid at an elevation of . The population was c. 9,000 .\n\nThe town is located on the Douro River although the river is not navigable up to Tordesillas. There are highway connections to Madrid, to the southeast, and with Salamanca, to the southwest. The provincial capital of Valladolid is also linked by four-lane highway. \n\nBecause of its important highway connections Tordesillas has become a major transit hub. The economy is based on services — especially connected to tourism — and the agricultural production of the surrounding area. Wheat has long been the traditional agricultural product (see Cuisine of the province of Valladolid).\n\nThe town is well served by hotels with a parador, four three-star hotels, one two-star hotel, and ten hostels and pensions. There is also a camping site. There is also an abundance of restaurants — 27 in total — with the Parador restaurant having a three star classification. \nNorth of the town there is a fertile valley formed by the Douro, with extensive use of irrigation by central pivots.\n\nThe town is known for its Toro de la Vega festival during which a bull was slaughtered by people on horseback and on foot. Animal rights groups repeatedly tried to stop this from taking place. \n\nThe bull is at least five years old when he's killed and is allowed to live in a large property to keep him territorial, unlike other animals who are killed for the butcher at one year of age. Finally, in May 2016 the Regional government issued a decree prohibiting the slaughter of the bull in public; animal rights activists regarded it as a victory after years denouncing publicly the cruelty with great national and worldwide coverage. The mayor of the town, backed unanimously by the opposition, made a statement of outrage on the same day of the prohibition. The bull's slaughter had come to be inextricably associated with the name of the town, overshadowing its rich monumental and historical heritage.\n\nThe Roman Turris Sillae, built on the hill of Siellas, was the bulwark of the defensive line of the Duero during the Reconquest. In 1262 it received its charter from Alfonso X the Wise. The town began to be favored by the royal family and nobility, above all after Alfonso XI built a palace (1325). In the 15th century the town hosted several meetings of the Cortes. During the skirmishes between Henry IV and the nobility the city supported the monarchy, and again during the clashes between the Catholic Monarchs and Joanna La Beltraneja in 1476.\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs signed the Treaty of Tordesillas with the Portuguese crown in 1494, which established the line dividing the globe between Spain and Portugal for colonization purposes. This especially affected the Portuguese and Spanish colonization of the Americas, and placed the name Tordesillas in history worldwide ever since.\n\nDespite Tordesillas' traditional support for the monarchy, in the Castilian War of the Communities by citizens of Castile against the rule of Charles V, the city took the side of the \"Comuneros\". The leaders chose Charles' own mother, Queen Joanna I, as an alternative ruler in more than title in 1519. They came to the town to ask for the mediation of Joanna I, confined within the Santa Clara convent since 1509 by her father Ferdinand II. However, in 1521, after nearly a year of rebellion, the reorganized supporters of the emperor Charles V struck a crippling blow to the comuneros at the Battle of Villalar, and finally royal troops of the Count of Haro captured Tordesillas.\n\nThis 16th-century event was the beginning of a long decline from influence and prosperity. The ongoing position of Tordesillas at a crossing of historic roads and modern highways has been the decisive factor in its economic survival and development.\n\nThe Santa Clara buildings were originally built by King Alfonso XI as his palace in 1344. His son Peter the Cruel had it embellished by Mudéjar artists, beautiful works at Santa Clara, though on a much smaller scale than they did in the Alcázar of Seville. The facade, a lovely small patio, a chapel and the baths remain of Peter the Cruel's palace. Blanche de Bourbon was held here after her abandonment by Peter for María de Padilla in 1353. The former portal, blocked off now, has a particularly fine Mudéjar doorway. In 1363 he ceded Santa Clara to two of his daughters by María de Padilla. They turned it into a convent, but it retained its role as a royal palace.\n\nIn 1420 the Infante Don Enrique of Aragón burst into the palace and seized the person of John II, who escaped the Infante thanks to Álvaro de Luna.\n\nSanta Clara convent's saddest association is with Joanna I, Queen of Castile and Aragon, the daughter of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon. She ascended the Castilian throne as Princess of Asturias in 1502 and succeeded her mother as Queen regnant of Castile in 1504. Joanna's life with her husband Philip I of Castile was rendered extremely unhappy by his infidelity and political insecurity, during which he consistently attempted to usurp her legal birthrights of power. This led in great part to the rumors of her insanity due to reports of depressive or neurotic acts committed while she was being imprisoned or coerced by her husband; most historians now agree she was merely clinically depressed or schizophrenic at the time, not 'insane' as commonly believed. His early death in 1506 added the pressures of her father now maneuvering to block her legal birthrights of power and sole rule. He succeeded, and as Regent ordered his daughter confined within the Convent of Santa Clara in 1509.\n\nHere she received her son Charles I after his arrival in Spain in 1517 from Flanders. Charles had landed on the Asturian coast in September and it took six weeks for the royal entourage to reach Tordesillas. He had become co-monarch of Castile and Aragon with his mother, after the regent period and Ferdinand II's death in 1519. Charles continued her imprisonment until she died in 1555, after being confined nearly fifty years inside Santa Clara. The fact that Juana remained, on record, the legitimate Queen regnant of Castile and Aragon until her death must have caused Charles at least some disquiet. His chambers at the monastery of Yuste (Cáceres) to which he retired on his abdication of the Spanish and Holy Roman Emperor crowns in 1556, a year after her death in Tordesillas, were and still are hung in black in her memory. The exact windowless rooms of her confinement are unknown, however in one room her little clavichord has been preserved.\n\nThe Plaza Mayor is the historic and attractive central community space framed by the 17th century colonnade and porticos creating the arcade that encircles it.\n\nNearby is the Church of Santa Maria, built from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. It has a monumental baroque sacristy. The town's other landmark churches are San Juan, San Pedro, Santiago, and San Antolín.\n\nThe massive 15th-century Church of San Antolín is of special interest, containing a museum of religious art collected from churches in the vicinity. The spacious church interior has a single nave, and its most outstanding feature is the sumptuous Alderete Chapel, containing the 1550 alabaster tomb of Don Pedro de Alderete, Commander of the Order of Santiago.\n\nThere are also two other historic convents besides Santa Clara in Tordesillas — \"Convento de Carmelo\" and \"Convento de San Francisco\".\n\nThe Main Feasts in Tordesillas are held in September although the date is variable every year.\n\nThe celebrations are in honour of Our Lady 'La Virgen de la Peña', (Our Lady of the Rock) Patron Saint of the Village and Land of Tordesillas. Her hermitage is located on the other side of the river, where people arrive for the romería (pilgrimage) in carts drawn by decorated horses.\n\nCelebrations begin on 8 September, Patron Saint's Day of Tordesillas, the 'Virgen de la Guía' (Our Guiding Lady).\n\nFollowing Saturday to 8 September is called \"Sábado de Faroles\". (The Saturday of torchs or lanterns made of wood). During the night there is the \"Desfile de Faroles\", a big parade where each competing \"peña\" (crew or team) carries a \"farol\" (which is somewhat bigger than a common streetlamp). Each side of the \"farol\" is painted with typical images about Tordesillas and about the festivities. Crews, accompanied by brass bands, take part in the parade carrying their \"faroles\", along the streets of the village. The crew judged to have the most beautiful farole is awarded a prize.\n\nThe guards' patrol through the old walls of Tordesillas gave rise to this curious celebration that traverses the whole village.\n\nThe \"Virgen de la Peña\" Patron Saint's Day is celebrated on Sunday. The following Tuesday there is a well-known local tournament called, in Spanish, \"Torneo del Toro de la Vega\" (The Meadow Bull Tournament), \n\nThe bull is driven by horsemen. When it reaches the meadow across the river it is finally speared and stabbed by many competing lancers. The person who delivers the fatal blow (this can be with a rifle) is entitled to cut off the bull's testicles impaled on the tip of his spear and parade them through the town. The city then awards him a gold medal and a commemorative forged iron spear.\n\n"}
{"id": "1937698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937698", "title": "Carbine (horse)", "text": "Carbine (horse)\n\nCarbine (1885–1914), was an outstanding New Zealand bred Thoroughbred racehorse, who competed in New Zealand and later Australia. During his racing career he won 30 stakes or principal races. Owing to his performance on the track and his subsequent achievements as a sire, he became one of five inaugural inductees into both the New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame and the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nCarbine was foaled at Sylvia Park Stud near Auckland, New Zealand on 18 September 1885. He was a bay stallion by the English Ascot Stakes winner and successful sire Musket out of the imported mare Mersey (GB) by Knowsley. Carbine was inbred to Brown Bess in the third and fourth generations. He was a half-brother to the stakes winning stallion, Carnage, winner of the VRC Victoria Derby, AJC Champagne Stakes, VRC Spring Stakes and VRC Essendon Stakes. When fully mature, Carbine stood about 16 hands 1 inch in height, possessed good conformation and temperament, although he had some foibles.\n\nDuring his career on the race track, Carbine started 43 times for 33 wins, six seconds and three thirds, failing to place only once due to a badly split hoof. He was popular with racing fans, and sporting commentators of the day praised him for his gameness, versatility, stamina and weight-carrying ability, as well as for his speed.\n\nCarbine, nicknamed \"Old Jack\", was undefeated in five starts in top-class races as a two-year-old in New Zealand. He then was taken to Australia, where he won nine of 13 starts as a three-year-old. One highlight that year was his win in the AJC Sydney Cup of 2 miles (3,220 metres) carrying 12 lb (5.5 kg) over weight-for-age. Despite suffering interference at the half-mile post and being buffeted back to last place, Carbine won by a head in a record time of 3 min 31 s. (Race times were slower in Carbine's era than now due, among other factors, to the rough state of tracks and the upright posture in the saddle assumed by 19th-century jockeys.) At the end of his three-year-old racing season, Carbine was sold by his owner-trainer Dan O'Brien for 3,000 guineas and prepared by his new owners for racing in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nAs a four- and five-year-old, Carbine won 17 of what would prove to be his last 18 races. On four occasions Carbine won twice on the same day. His victory in the 1890 Melbourne Cup was noteworthy. He set a weight-carrying record of 10 st 5 lb (66 kg) in the Cup, defeating a field of 39 starters and setting a record time for the race. He carried 53 lb (24 kg) more than the second-place horse, Highborn.\n\nCarbine was owned for most of his Australian career by Donald Wallace, a wealthy horse-breeder, investor, and Member of the Victorian Parliament. Walter Hickenbotham, a prominent Melbourne-based horseman, trained him. Wallace and Hickenbotham planned to enter Carbine in the 1891 Melbourne Cup and other major events of that year's turf calendar but a chronic heel injury thwarted their intentions, and Carbine was retired to Wallace's stud.\nCarbine proved his stud potential the following year, 1892, by siring a colt named Wallace, who went on to become an exceptionally good racehorse and sire. Wallace was considered the best of Carbine's Australian-bred progeny. He won the VATC Caulfield Guineas, Victoria Derby, Sydney Cup and other good races. Despite limited stud opportunities Wallace was the Leading sire in Australia in the 1915/16 season. Wallace also finished second three times and third three times on the leading sires' table. During Carbine's short Australian stud career he sired the winners of 203½ races worth £48,624, including the multiple stakes winners, Amberite (won Victoria Derby and Caulfield Cup etc.) and La Carabine (Sydney Cup and VRC Australian Cup etc.).\n\nIn 1895, the Duke of Portland purchased Carbine for 13,000 guineas. He was shipped from Melbourne to the Duke's English stud at Welbeck Abbey where he was the second stud sire to the outstanding St. Simon, who covered the best mares. A son of Carbine, Greatorex, was a minor race winner in England before he was exported to South Africa, where he became a leading sire on ten occasions and influenced bloodlines there. Carbine sired Spearmint, the 1906 Epsom Derby and 1906 Grand Prix de Paris winner. Spearmint in turn sired Spion Kop, who also won the Epsom Derby. Spion Kop's offspring included another Derby winner, Felstead. Felstead's son, The Buzzard, later stood at stud in Australia. The wheel of history turned full circle when two of The Buzzard's offspring, Old Rowley and Rainbird, each won the Melbourne Cup, in 1940 and 1945, respectively. Spearmint was the sire of American three-year-old champion, Johren, foaled in 1915 in England and exported to America as a yearling. Johren was the winner of the 1918 Belmont Stakes and was awarded the American Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year.\n\nOver half of the 65 Melbourne Cup winners from 1914 to 1978 were descendants of Carbine, including Comic Court, Phar Lap, Rising Fast, Rain Lover and Think Big. Statistics and contemporary assessments indicate that he was a dominant antipodean racehorse of the 19th century, and he still ranks with such 20th-century Thoroughbreds as his descendants Danzig, Nearco, Northern Dancer, Mr. Prospector, Nasrullah, Nijinsky II (winner of the UK Triple Crown), Royal Charger and Royal Palace (who have established their own sire-lines) in terms of renown among turf historians.\n\nThe descendants of Carbine include eight of the nine horses to earn $10,000,000 or more in stakes wins. These horses are Deep Impact, Makybe Diva, Narita Brian, Sunline, Symboli Kris S, T M Opera O, Viva Pataca and Vodka. Modern day competitors Mine That Bird, Rachel Alexandra and Australian champion Winx trace to Carbine through both their sire and dam.\n\nCarbine died at Welbeck on 10 June 1914. He had suffered a stroke and was put down with a drug to end his suffering, according to the horse's 'biographer', Grania Polliness. The Duke of Portland gave his skeleton to the Melbourne Museum. Today it is displayed at the Australian Racing Museum and Hall of Fame in Melbourne. Carbine's combined record of documented success as both a racehorse and an international sire is possibly unequalled by any other Australasian Thoroughbred.\n\nCarbine had his portrait painted by the noted equine artist, Martin Stainforth and it was reproduced in \"Racehorses in Australia\".\n\nCarbine's mounted head and tail are in the collection of the Auckland War Memorial Museum.\n\nCarbine's name is immortalised in the name of the road which runs through what was once the Sylvia Park Stud, Carbine Road.\n\nThe Perkins Brewery (Toowoomba) named a beer after Carbine \" Carbine Stout\" in 1915. When the brewery closed in 1958 Carbine Stout was brewed at Castlemaine Perkins' famous Milton site until 2005, and still to this day XXXX receive requests from Stout fans who try valiantly to convince Castlemaine to brew it again.\n\n\n\n"}

The script was written by Mike Sussman from a story by executive producer Manny Coto. It was the second episode of \"Enterprise\" to be directed by Michael Grossman. The episode is the first of a two-part story, which concludes with \"\".\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. In \"Affliction\", the crew investigate the kidnapping of Doctor Phlox (John Billingsley), and the ship is attacked by a new type of Klingon. Meanwhile, Phlox is taken to a Klingon colony to work on a cure for a plague whose effects include the disappearance of the Klingon's cranial ridges.\n\nThe episode sought to answer the question of why Klingons looked different in \"\" than in other series of the franchise. It also introduced Section 31, originally seen in \"\", to an earlier time in the Star Trek canon.\n\nThe episode featured a number of guest stars who had previous connections to the franchise, including James Avery who was in the running for the part of Worf in , John Schuck who played a Klingon Ambassador in two \"Star Trek\" films, and Eric Pierpoint who had appeared in several other episodes of \"Star Trek\" previously. Some of the standing sets were redressed to appear as the interior of the \"Columbia\", and some scenes were filmed outside at the Paramount Studios lot in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\"Enterprise\" returns to Earth in time for the launch of the second NX class starship, \"Columbia\", and Commander Tucker prepares for his transfer. Meanwhile, Ensign Sato and Doctor Phlox are attacked in San Francisco, and Phlox is kidnapped. Captain Archer and Lieutenant Reed investigate the scene, and Reed is given a secret assignment by a secretive agent that he seems to know. Commander T'Pol, seeking information from Sato, conducts her first mind-meld, and the two realize that the attackers spoke Rigelian. They discover that a Rigelian freighter recently left orbit and head off in pursuit.\n\nOn \"Columbia\", Tucker ruffles a few feathers of his new team, and Captain Hernandez asks the reasons behind his transfer. Later, T'Pol, in her quarters, begins to meditate and mentally goes to her white cloud quiet place only to have a slightly confused, but still amused, Tucker show up there and start arguing with her. The moment of the shared vision (despite being on different ships) is broken when a disoriented Tucker appears to come out of a momentary daydream on \"Columbia\". \"Enterprise\" locates a destroyed Rigelian ship, and while investigating, they are suddenly attacked and boarded. MACOs repel the attack and a captured alien is taken to Sickbay, where scanners show that despite his human appearance, he is in fact Klingon. Archer then discovers Reed's complicity in evidence tampering and confines him to the brig. Archer also learns that the boarders sabotaged the ship, and he orders maximum speed in order to prevent the warp core from overloading. The ship increases speed to , the fastest it has ever been.\n\nPhlox is taken to \"Qu'Vat\", a Klingon colony where General K'Vagh and Doctor Antaak seek his help to cure a Klingon plague. To Phlox's horror, K'Vagh kills an infected Klingon so that an autopsy can be performed. Phlox determines that the victim's DNA has been supplemented with that of a genetically augmented human. Phlox also learns from Antaak that they experimented with augmented DNA after the events seen in \"\", but it self-mutated and escaped. Antaak and Phlox are told that they have five days to cure the outbreak before it is too late. Antaak suggests that the only course of action is to create stable augmented Klingons, but Phlox refuses to assist further.\n\nThe storyline in \"Affliction\" answers an ongoing question which had begun with the pilot episode of \"Enterprise\", \"\". In \"The Original Series\", Klingons appeared mostly human, with no applied prosthetics. However, in \"\", they first appeared with forehead ridges and continued to appear this way through the remaining movies as well as , and . The \"DS9\" episode \"Trials and Tribble-ations\" references the change, with Chief O'Brien suggesting that Klingons had been genetically modified and Doctor Bashir assuming a viral mutation had taken place.\n\nTheories created by fans included the idea that the ridgeless Klingons were from a specific part of the home world, but this was discounted when three ridgeless Klingons from \"The Original Series\" appeared with ridges in the \"Deep Space Nine\" episode \"\". \"The Original Series\" had a restricted budget, and there was no funding for any prosthetic make-up for the Klingons until \"The Motion Picture\". During \"The Original Series\", it was decided to use them more frequently than the Romulans, whose prosthetics were more expensive. The original ridgeless design was created after suggestions by John Colicos, who based them on Genghis Khan and the people of the 13th and 14th century Mongol Empire. When \"Broken Bow\" aired, it featured Klingons with forehead ridges, despite the series being set prior to \"The Original Series\". On the episode's script, the old style Klingons were referred to as \"type-two\" and \"semi-Klingons\".\n\nThe storyline was one of several in the fourth season of \"Enterprise\" which show runner Manny Coto sought to connect the series to \"The Original Series\". Coto also revealed in an interview with the \"Chicago Tribune\" that the episode would see the start of Section 31. The episode also featured the first appearance on-screen of the Rigelians, despite first being mentioned in \"The Original Series\" and again in \"DS9\". \"Affliction\" marks the fifth writing credit of the fourth season for Michael Sussman, while director Michael Grossman had previously directed the episode \"\".\n\nFilming took place from December 3, 2004 through to December 12. Several of the standing sets were redressed to appear as the locations on the USS \"Columbia\", including the bridge, Captain's mess and the engineering section. The exterior scenes where Phlox and Hoshi were attacked were filmed on the Paramount lot in Los Angeles. As the New York streets backlot had already been used earlier in the season for the opening episode \"\", this sequence was instead filmed in the area between the studio's Administration building and a building which had previously doubled for the high school in the sitcom \"Happy Days\".\n\nJames Avery was cast as the Klingon General K’Vagh. He underwent a three-hour make-up process for the role, something he later described as a nightmare. He had previously been involved with \"Star Trek\" in 1987, when he was the runner up to Michael Dorn to be cast as Worf in \"The Next Generation\". He became better known as Phil Banks in \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\". \"Affliction\" also featured a cameo by Marc Worden as a Klingon prisoner, who had previously appeared in the \"Deep Space Nine\" episodes \"\" and \"You Are Cordially Invited\" as Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko.\n\nJohn Schuck was cast as the Klingon doctor Antaak, having previously appeared as the Klingon Ambassador in both \"\" and \"\". Schuck had also appeared in episodes of both \"Deep Space Nine\" and \"Voyager\". Eric Pierpoint had previously appeared in several episodes of \"Star Trek\" across the various television series, including the \"TNG\" episode \"\" as well as episodes of \"DS9\" and \"Voyager\". He had also appeared in the \"Enterprise\" episode \"\".\n\nBrad Greenquist appeared as a Rigelian in this episode in his second appearance on \"Enterprise\", he too had also previously appeared in episodes of \"DS9\" and \"Voyager\". The other Rigelians were played by stuntmen Brian Williams and Tom Dupont, whilst Linda Park was stunt-doubled by Diana Inosato. It was the second appearance of Seth MacFarlane, the creator of the animated television show \"Family Guy\", in a role in \"Enterprise\". He had previously appeared as an unnamed character in the third-season episode \"\" but gains the name Ensign Rivers in \"Affliction\".\n\n\"Affliction\" originally aired on UPN, on February 18, 2005. It received a 1.8/3% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 1.8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 3 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This equals the ratings received by the previous episode, \"The Aenar\", which received the highest ratings of the fourth season so far. It finished behind programs on NBC, The WB, ABC, CBS and Fox.\n\nMichelle Erica Green reviewed this episode for TrekNation, and described it as a \"rollicking good ride\". She thought that linking the reason for the Klingons' appearance change to the augmented humans from earlier in the season was a clever idea, but the introduction of Section 31 was suspect as they hadn't been mentioned at all through the season three Xindi arc. She was pleased with the level of detail shown on screen, such as the computer-generated targs and Tucker changing the patch on his uniform when he transfers to the \"Columbia\". Green said that John Billingsley \"excels\" in this episode, and that the ending was \"perfect\". Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website \"Jammer's Reviews\", gave the episode a score of three out of four, saying that it was \"solid and entertaining, but with no real signs of greatness\" and thought that the cliffhanger ending was unnecessary. The two part story featuring the episodes \"Affliction\" and \"Divergence\" were subsequently ranked the fifth best story of \"Enterprise\" by \"Den of Geek\" writer James Hunt. Variety magazine notes the role actor James Avery, noted for his role on the Fresh Prince of Bel Air TV show, as a Klingon General.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with some of the show's cast with SyFy, this episode was a recommended favorite of theirs.\n\n\"Den of Geek\" recommended “\" and this episode for development of the character Malcolm Reed.\n\nThis episode was released on home media on DVD, as part of the season four box set on November 1, 2005 in the United States, and on Blu-ray, released on April 1, 2014.\n\n"}

He is the founder and president of the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) and Peace TV. He has been called an \"authority on comparative religion\", \"perhaps the most influential Salafi ideologue in India\", \"the rock star of tele-evangelism and a proponent of modern Islam\" and \"the world's leading Salafi evangelist\".\n\nBefore becoming a public speaker, he trained as a physician. He has published booklet versions of lectures on Islam and comparative religion. Although he has publicly disclaimed sectarianism in Islam, he is regarded as an exponent of the Salafi ideology, and by many sources as a radical Islamist promoting Wahhabism. His preaching is currently banned in India, Bangladesh, Canada, the United Kingdom and Malaysia, under anti-terrorism or anti-hate laws. His TV channel Peace TV is banned in his native India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Following action by Ofcom in 2019, Peace TV surrendered its licence to broadcast in the UK. In April 2020, the Charity Commission for England and Wales opened a statutory enquiry into the registered charity Islamic Research Foundation, which has funded Peace TV.\nZakir Naik was born in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. He attended Kishinchand Chellaram College and studied medicine at the Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Charitable Hospital and later the University of Mumbai, where he obtained a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS).\n\nIn 1991 he started working in the field of Dawah, and founded the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF). Naik's wife, Farhat Naik, is the President of the women's section of the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF).\n\nNaik said in 2006 that he was inspired by Ahmed Deedat, an Islamic preacher whom he met in 1987. (Naik is sometimes referred to as \"Deedat plus\", a label given to him by Deedat.)\n\nNaik founded the Islamic International School in Mumbai. and United Islamic Aid, which provides scholarship to poor and destitute Muslim youth.\n\nThe Islamic Research Foundation website describes Naik as \"the ideologue and driving force behind Peace TV Network\". Naik's channel is to promote \"Truth, Justice, Morality, Harmony and Wisdom for the whole of humankind\", mentions its website. The Indian government banned the Peace TV channel in 2012. According to \"The New York Times\" in 2015, quoting an anonymous Indian journalist, the Mumbai police have barred him from holding conferences \"because he stirs controversy\", and Indian satellite providers have refused to broadcast his television channel, Peace TV. However, as of August 2019, Peace TV was still available in India through a free app in the Google Play Store, which had been downloaded over a lakh (100,000) times.\n\nIn 2016, during a press conference Naik claimed himself to be a non-resident Indian (NRI). In 2017, according to the Middle East Monitor, Naik was granted citizenship by Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn 18 July 2017, India revoked Naik's passport following a recommendation from the National Investigation Agency (NIA). On 28 July 2017, the NIA declared Naik an offender and initiated a process to attach his assets.  In December 2017, Interpol refused the Indian Government's request to issue a red corner notice (RCN) against Naik. In January 2018, the Tribunal judge criticised the Enforcement Directorate for attaching Naik's properties without mentioning any offenses in the chargesheet. The judge added: \"In the last 10 years, the ED has done nothing to attach Asaram's properties, but in the case of Naik, I can see the ED working with quite a bit of speed\".\n\nIn July 2019 Interpol refused for a third time to issue a Red corner notice against Naik after repeated requests by the Indian Government. Naik currently resides in Malaysia, where he has permanent resident status.\n\nUnlike many Islamic preachers, his lectures are colloquial, given in English, not Urdu or Arabic, and he usually wears a suit and tie.\nNaik has held many debates and lectures and is said to \"have delivered over 2000/4000 lectures around the world\". Anthropologist Thomas Blom Hansen has written that Naik's style of memorising the Quran and Hadith literature in various languages, and his related missionary activity, has made him extremely popular in Muslim circles. Many of his debates are recorded and widely distributed in video and DVD media and online. His talks have been recorded in English and broadcast on weekends on several cable networks in Mumbai's Muslim neighbourhoods, and on the Peace TV channel, which he co-produces. Topics he speaks on include: \"Islam and Modern Science\", \"Islam and Christianity\", and \"Islam and secularism\".\n\nHis first debate was in 1994, a debate on the views of writer Taslima Nasreen on Islam in her book \"Lajja\", organised at the \"Mumbai Marathi Patrakar Sangh\", entitled \"Is Religious Fundamentalism a Stumbling block to Freedom of Expression?\". With the presence of four journalists, the debate went on for hours. In April 2000, Naik debated with William Campbell in Chicago on the topic of \"The Qur'an and the Bible: In the Light of Science\", one of his most-cited debates. On 21 January 2006 Naik held an inter-religious dialogue with Ravi Shankar in Bangalore about the concept of God in Islam and Hinduism. In February 2011 Naik addressed the Oxford Union via video link from India. Every year since November 2007 Naik has led a 10-day Peace Conference at Somaiya Ground, Sion, Mumbai. Lectures on Islam have been presented by Naik and twenty other Islamic speakers.\n\nIn 2004 Naik, at the invitation of the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia, made an appearance at the University of Melbourne, where he argued that only Islam gave women true equality. He said the more \"revealing Western dress\" makes women more susceptible to rape. Sushi Das of \"The Age\" commented that \"Naik extolled the moral and spiritual superiority of Islam and lampooned other faiths and the West in general\", further stating that Naik's words \"fostered a spirit of separateness and reinforced prejudice\".\n\nIn August 2006, Naik's visit and conference in Cardiff caused controversy when Welsh MP David Davies called for his appearance to be cancelled. He said Naik was a \"hate-monger\", and that his views did not deserve a public platform. Muslims from Cardiff, however, defended Naik's right to speak in the city. Saleem Kidwai, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Wales, stated that \"people who know about him [Naik] know that he is one of the most uncontroversial persons you could find. He talks about the similarities between religions, and how should we work on the common ground between them\", whilst also inviting Davies to discuss further with Naik personally in the conference. The conference went ahead, after the Cardiff council stated it was satisfied that he would not be preaching extremist views.\n\nNaik was denied entry into the United Kingdom and Canada in June 2010. Naik was forbidden to enter Canada after Tarek Fatah, founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress, warned MPs of Naik's views. He was banned from entering the UK by the then Home Secretary Theresa May after arranging to give talks in London and Sheffield. May said of the exclusion order, \"Numerous comments made by Dr Naik are evidence to me of his unacceptable behaviour\". Naik argued that the Home Secretary was making a political decision, not a legal one, and his lawyer said the decision was \"barbaric and inhuman\". He also claimed that his comments were taken out of context. Film producer Mahesh Bhatt supported Naik, saying the ban constituted an attack on freedom of speech. It was reported that Naik would attempt to challenge the ruling in the High Court. His application for judicial review was dismissed on 5 November 2010.\n\nIn 2014, Naik visited Gambia at the invitation of President Yahya Jammeh to attend the grand celebration of Gambian revolution's 20th anniversary. There he delivered four lectures between 11 and 22 October. The lectures took place in University of the Gambia, Pancha Mi Hall of Paradise Suites Hotel, presidents home village Kanilai, Foni Kansala and Kairaba Beach Hotel, Kololi. Gambian cabinet ministers, religious leaders, students and thousands of people attended his lectures on subjects including \"Terrorism and Jihad: an Islamic perspective\", \"religion in the right perspective\", \"Dawah or destruction?\" and \"the misconceptions about Islam\". Meanwhile, he also met with the president Yahya Jammeh along with Gambia Supreme Islamic Council and held an Islamic conference with the Imams of Gambia.\n\nNaik delivered four lectures in Malaysia during 2012. The lectures took place in Johor Bahru, Universiti Teknologi MARA in Shah Alam, Kuantan and Putra World Trade Centre in Kuala Lumpur. The former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, prominent figures and several thousand people attended the lectures at different places despite protest by the members of HINDRAF. The organisers of Naik's speeches said their purpose was to promote harmony among people of various religions.\n\nNaik delivered another six lectures in April 2016. Two of his lectures in Malaysia, entitled \"Similarities between Hinduism and Islam\" and \"Is the Quran God's word?\" were objected by HINDRAF, along with other NGOs, saying that these lectures might provoke inter-racial tensions. With the initial support of the Government authority, the event went ahead as planned.\n\nNaik delivered a speech on Islamophobia on 9 August 2019 at the Sultan Mohammad IV Stadium, Kota Bharu, Kelantan which was attended by more than 100,000 people.\n\nNaik says that his goal is to \"concentrate on the educated Muslim youth who have become apologetic about their own religion and have started to feel the religion is outdated\". He considers it a duty of every Muslim to remove perceived misconceptions about Islam and to counter what he views as the Western media's anti-Islamic bias in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. Naik has said that \"despite the strident anti-Islam campaign, 34,000 Americans have embraced Islam from September 2001 to July 2002\". According to Naik, Islam is a religion of reason and logic, and the Quran contains 1000 verses relating to science, which he says explains the number of Western converts. Some of his articles are published in magazines such as \"Islamic Voice\".\n\nNaik says that Islam is the \"best\" religion because \"the Quran says it. No other religious text or scripture claims this fact.\" He added that, \"Islam is also labelled as intolerant, and it is indeed, but towards corruption, discrimination, injustice, adultery, alcoholism, and all evils. Islam is the most 'tolerant' religion as far as promoting the human values is concerned.\"\n\nZakir Naik criticized the partition of India and creation of Pakistan, calling it a tragedy. Naik holds that those who advocated the creation of Pakistan out of the northwestern provinces of colonial India were \"not even practising Muslims\".\n\nNaik equates music with alcohol and says that both are intoxicating in nature. He has condemned dancing and singing because he claims they are prohibited in Islam.\n\nNaik said that guilty people must be punished and accepts chopping off hands for stealing. He has also recommended that the United States implements this logic in order to reduce criminality.\n\nNaik states that it is permissible to beat one's wife \"gently\". He argues that \"as far as the family is concerned, a man is the leader. So, he has the right\", but he should beat his wife \"lightly\". He also said that Muslims have the right to sex with their female slaves where he referred to slaves as \"prisoners of war\".\n\nNaik referred to the LGBT community as \"patients suffering from sinful mental problems\" and said that \"It's because they watch pornographic movies. The TV channels are to be blamed\". \"According to \"Quran and Sunnah\"\", he recommends the \"death penalty\" for homosexuals.\n\nDismissing Darwin's \"Theory of Evolution\", Naik said that the theory of evolution is \"only a hypothesis, and an unproven conjecture at best\". According to Naik, most scientists \"support the theory, because it went against the Bible – not because it was true.\" Naik argues that scientific theories were prophesied by the Quran. For example, he has stated in 2010 that certain verses of the Quran accurately describe embryological development.\n\nNaik argues, \"What Darwin said was only a 'theory'. There is no book saying 'the Fact of Evolution' – All the books say \"Theory of Evolution\".\" He further added, \"There is not a single statement in the Qur'an, which Science has proved wrong yet. Hypothesis go against the Qur'an – theories go against the Qur'an. There is not a single scientific fact, which is mentioned in the Holy Qur'an which goes against established science – It may go against theory.\"\n\nNaik has called the media \"the most important tool rather the most dangerous weapon in the world, which converts black into white and a villain into a hero\". He suggested that, \"We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam.\" He claimed, western powers and media play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as extremists and fundamentalists to defame Islam. He said, \"The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims.\" Naik also claimed the \"third and fourth\" strategy by international media is \"to pick a word from Quran or sunnah and mistranslate it\" and \"to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it\".\n\nNaik also said, \"If a Muslim woman wears hijab or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a nun does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give rights to women, and is an illogical religion. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words. A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While Indians were fighting for their freedom, the British government was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people.\" \n\nHe criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, \"Hundreds of movies were made in Hollywood to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying 'Allah Akbar', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious Quran and Hadith rather than looking to its followers (Muslims) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest Mercedes car he was driving. The best exemplary Muslim is the last and final messenger prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.\" He also criticized media for \"pick(ing) up Muslims who criticised Islam like Salman Rushdie, and giv(ing) them awards\", saying, \"If a Muslim does something great, they may give him credit but ignore his religion or change his Muslim name like the Aristotle of the East, Avicenna, whose real name was \"Ali Ibn Sina\".\"\n\nNaik believes that Muslims who convert from Islam should not necessarily receive death sentences, but that under Islamic law those who leave Islam and then \"propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam\" should be put to death. Another source states that according to Naik, \"There is no death penalty for apostates in Islam ... until, the apostate starts to preach his new religion: then he can be put to death.\"\n\nWhile he appreciates that people of other religions allow Muslims to freely propagate Islam in their country, Naik preaches that the dissemination of other religions within an Islamic state must be forbidden because he believes that other faiths are incorrect, so their propagation is as wrong as it would be for an arithmetic teacher to teach that 2+2=3 or 6 instead of 2+2=4.\n\nLikewise, Naik argues, \"regarding building of churches or temples, how can we (Muslims) allow this when their religion is wrong and when their worshiping is wrong?\"\n\nNaik criticises the activities of Christian missionaries in the Muslim world saying, \"the missionaries write verses of the bible in Arabic calligraphy, such as 'God is love' to catch fish with the Muslims. We in Peace TV, for example, do not use such deceit.\"\n\nIn a lecture given in University of the Gambia, Zakir strongly condemned the atrocities around the world in the name of Jihad, where innocent people lost their lives, saying \"Jihad is misunderstood by both Muslims and non-Muslims, Jihad means to strive and struggle to make society better, the best form of Jihad is to strive and struggle against non-Muslims, using the teachings of the Quran; the Prophet Peace Be Upon Him and the Almighty Allah, Islam means peace.\" According to Naik, the killing of any innocent person, either Muslim or not is prohibited by Islam, while condemning the double-standard, played by the western powers and media who describes Muslims as extremists and fundamentalists. He said in unequivocal term that, even in Islamic Jihad, there are laid down rules and regulations as when and how to kill a person, which he noted, totally contradicts what is currently happening around the world, by some groups who claim to fight for Jihad.\n\nIn another lecture given in Al-Khawaneej, Dubai, Naik stated that the most mistranslated and misunderstood word about Islam by non-Muslims and even some Muslims is \"Jihad\", which, he said, has nothing to do with the phrase \"holy war\" that is never actually used in the Quran or sunnah and was first used by the crusaders who killed millions in the name of Christianity. He added the word \"Jihad\" actually means to strive or struggle against one's own evil inclinations, to make the society better, in self-defense on a battlefield, and against oppression.\n\nIn a lecture delivered on 31 July 2008 on Peace TV, Naik commented on the attacks of 11 September: \"it is a blatant, open secret that this attack on the Twin Towers was done by George Bush himself\". He also said that \"even a fool will know\" that the 9/11 attacks were \"an inside job\" orchestrated by US President George W. Bush.\n\nHis opinions on 9/11 have been denounced by the United States and he has been denied entry into the United Kingdom and Canada for speaking engagements.\n\nHis views and statements on terrorism have been often criticised in the media. Speaking of Osama bin Laden, when Naik was asked whether the former was a terrorist, he stated that he did not have an opinion since had not met him, nor interrogated him, and is neither a friend nor an enemy.\n\nLater in 2010, Naik said that he had been quoted out of context regarding the remarks on terrorism. \"As far as terrorist is concerned\", he said, \"I tell the Muslims that every Muslim should be a terrorist... What is the meaning of the word terrorist? Terrorist by definition means a person who terrorises. So in this context every Muslim should be a terrorist to each and every anti-social element. I'm aware that terrorist is more commonly used for a person who terrorises innocent human beings. So in this context no Muslim should ever terrorise a single innocent human being.\"\n\nNaik stated that Hitler, \"who was not a Muslim, is the biggest terrorist in the world as he incinerated 46 million [sic.] Jews.\"\n\nWhen asked about his views on killings, Naik said \"the Quran says so – if anyone kills an innocent human being, Muslim or non-Muslim, it is as though he has killed the whole humanity, So how can any Muslim kill innocent human beings?\" It was only permissible, he said, to kill a person who \"has killed someone else ... or created corruption in the land.\" He also criticized the media for \"picking up verses of the Quran or hadiths and quoting them out of context to mislabel Islam as a religion that promotes violence and killing\". He said that \"critics of Islam quotes Verse 5/9 which reads: 'Wherever you find a non-Muslim, kill him' out of context to malign Islam though it was an order in a battlefield, and Islam always promotes peace as better option during war.\"\n\nIn a press conference via Skype, when Naik was asked for his opinion on suicide bombings he replied affirmatively, saying it was permitted in Islam and said \"it is haram if innocent people are being killed. But, if suicide bombing is used as a tactic of war, then it may be permitted. For example, in World War II, Japan used suicide bombing as a tactic of war.\"\n\nNajibullah Zazi, the Afghan-American linked to Al-Qaeda who was found guilty in the 2009 New York City Subway and United Kingdom plot was an \"admirer\" of Naik's sermons. When \"Time\" hinted that his preachings could have inspired Najibullah Zazi's terrorist activities, Naik insisted: \"I have always condemned terrorism, because according to the glorious Koran, if you kill one innocent person, then you have killed the whole of humanity.\"\n\nNaik called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria the \"anti-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\" and said that the enemies of Islam were promoting ISIS. He also added, \"We should not say ISIS, we should say AISIS. Because they are anti-Islamic. I request all the Muslims of the world, as well as the Muslim media: Please don't help the enemies of Islam in attacking Islam.\" He further added, \"If you verify you will know that I am totally against terrorism. I am totally against killing any innocent human being.\" He opposed the move by the United States government to launch an attack on ISIS in Syria and Iraq that, while strongly condemning the acts of the Islamic State group. In another lecture in Dubai, he stated, It is, therefore not correct to say ISIS or Islamic State has killed Syrian or Iraqi innocents. He said, \"We should say anti-Islamic state kills them as Quran affirms that whoever kills an innocent person is as if he kills all humanity, and he who saves a single person - disregard his religion, is like saving all humanity.\"\n\nZakir criticized the media for \"linking Islam\" with the Orlando attack. He accused the media of a \"double-standard strategy\" saying, \"the same (double-standard strategy) is happening with a man related by nothing to Islam but by his name who killed over 50 gays in Orlando.\"\n\nIn 11 May 2019, in an interview in Week magazine, Zakir Naik harshly criticized Narendra Modi and the BJP for false charges and propaganda against him for political purposes, and said that he is targeted for his popularity. Further, he stated that he would not return to India while Modi remained in power, according to the example of the prophet Muhammad in Hijrah. He also described Modi and the BJP as dangerous for Indian Muslims' security, labelling him a \"liar\" and the \"number one terrorist of India according to Google.\" He also invited Modi to take part in a debate with him about Hinduism. In 2016, Naik had praised Narendra Modi, saying, \"I am totally for him\" because he was the first prime minister of India to have visited so many Muslim-majority countries.\n\nNaik was ranked 89 on \"The Indian Express's\" list of the \"100 Most Powerful Indians in 2010\". He was ranked 82 in the 2009 edition. According to Praveen Swami, Naik is \"perhaps the most influential Salafi ideologue in India\". Sanjiv Buttoo says he is acknowledged as an authority on Islam, but is known for making negative remarks about other religions. Sadanand Dhume writes that Naik has a \"carefully crafted image of moderation\", because of his gentle demeanour, his wearing of a suit and tie, and his quoting of scriptures of other religions. He is also listed in the book \"The 500 Most Influential Muslims\" under honourable mention, in the 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013/2014, 2015/2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 editions.\n\n\nSeveral researchers have investigated the link between Naik and terrorism. Author Praveen Swami considers Naik to be a part of the ideological infrastructure created to feed \"Tempered Jihad\", which he defines as Jihad calibrated to advance Islamist political objectives. Swami argued that some of Naik's teachings are similar to those of organizations advocating violence, although Naik himself emphatically rejects terrorism. According to Swami, Naik's IRF has proved to be a \"magnet\" for figures linked to the Lashkar-e-Taiba, while his message has mesmerised violent Islamists, and his works \"help make sense of the motivations of Indian recruits to the \"jihad\"\".\n\nIn 2008, an Islamic scholar in Lucknow, shahar qazi Mufti Abul Irfan Mian Firangi Mahali, issued a fatwa against Naik, claiming that he supported Osama bin Laden, and that his teachings were un-Islamic. Naik claims his speeches were being taken out of context.\n\nIn 2007, reports claimed that Darul Uloom considered him a self-styled preacher unattached to any of the four orthodox Sunni Islamic schools of jurisprudence (fiqh) and therefore has issued many fatwas against Zakir Naik, rejecting him as being amongst the ghair muqallidin (a term used in Islam to describe someone who does not relate with the four madhabs viz. Hanafi, Hanbali, Sha'afi and Maliki) thereby appealing towards Muslims to avoid listening to his sermons. In 2016, a Darul Uloom spokesman clarified reports that although a few fatwas had been issued by Darul Uloom against Naik on legal matters, these were being \"deliberately highlighted\" by the media. The deputy vice chancellor of Darul Uloom, Abdul Khaliq Madrasi, came out in his support, saying: \"We have bad differences of opinion with Zakir Naik. But he is recognized as an Islamic scholar the world over. We don't believe that he could be connected with terrorism in any way.\" \n\nAfter revealing the investigations of the Dhaka Terror Attack in July 2016 published by The Daily Star that a terrorist involved in the brutal killings followed Zakir Naik's page on Facebook and was influenced by Naik's speeches, The terrorist had posted sermons of Zakir Naik on social media where Naik urged \"all Muslims to be terrorists\" Indian Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said, \"Zakir Naik's speech is a matter of concern for us. Our agencies are working on this.\" He was then termed a controversial as well as a popular figure by the media. After 2 days in investigation, the Maharashtra State Intelligence Department (SID) gave a clean chit to Zakir Naik and said that Naik would not and cannot be arrested on his return to India as the probe ordered by the Maharashtra government did not find any other strong evidence to link Naik to terror-related activities. The Daily Star apologized to Naik over the Dhaka Terror Attack controversy and stated that they never blamed him for the attack. The newspaper quoted that it only reported how youth were misinterpreting his speeches. However, soon thereafter the Bangladesh Government banned the broadcast of Naik's Peace TV channel. Hasanul Haq Inu, the Information Minister, reasoned that \"Peace TV is not consistent with Muslim society, the Quran, Sunnah, Hadith, Bangladesh's Constitution, our culture, customs and rituals\".\n\nWhen the National Investigation Agency arrested Mohammad Ibrahim Yazdani, the head of Islamic State's Hyderabad module in India, upon interrogation it was revealed that the operatives were influenced by Zakir Naik's sermons and wanted to establish Shariah law as in Islamic state\n\nThere have been media reports of Intelligence Agencies probing the alleged links between terror group Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), and Naik's IRF. The JuD website is said to be referring to Zakir Naik's sermons & preachings.\n\nIn 2016, he admitted that Rahil Sheikh, involved in 2006 Mumbai train bombings was working as a volunteer for his organization Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) but he did not know Rahil personally. However, Naik also claimed that Rahil was removed from his office. Nearly 200 people lost their lives in the bombing attack and investigation revealed the bombers were influenced by Naik's preachings.\n\nReferring to the deadly attacks in Bangladesh by terrorists, author Taslima Nasreen said that \"Many Bangladeshi would-be-terrorists are inspired by Zakir Naik. He is not having machetes in hands. But his followers are having machetes in hands\". She added that, \"I'm not against Zakir Naik's free speech but I am against him for inciting violence. Fatwabaz should be banned from issuing.\"\n\nOn 13 July 2016, Vishva Hindu Parishad leader Sadhvi Prachi announced a reward of to anyone willing to behead Zakir Naik. This came a day after a Shia group styling itself the \"Hussaini Tigers\" placed a bounty on his head.\n\nZahran Hashim, the leader of the National Thowheeth Jama'ath which carried out the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter Bombings, had praised Naik for inciting Muslims without being banned and had asked \"What can Sri Lankan Muslims do for Dr Zakir Naik?\". After the attacks Sri Lankan cable TV channels stopped broadcasting PeaceTV.\n\nIndian prime minister Narendra Modi slammed Zakir Naik in one of his electorial publicity visit in May 2019, saying that, Sri Lanka bombing was inspired by him and in spite of that the Congress supports Zakir Naik.\n\n\"The Times of India\" published a profile of Naik entitled \"The controversial preacher\" after he was banned from the United Kingdom. According to \"The Times\", \"the fact is that barring the band of Muslims whose bruised egos Naik suitably massages through his Islam supremacist talks, most rational Muslims and non-Muslims find his brand of Islam a travesty of the faith\". \"The Times\" also claimed that \"the Wahabi-Salafist brand of Islam, bankrolled by petro-rich Saudi Arabia and propagated by preachers like Naik, does not appreciate the idea of pluralism.\" The article quotes Muslim scholar Wahiduddin Khan: \"Dawah, which Naik also claims to be engaged in, is to make people aware of the creation plan of God, not to peddle some provocative, dubious ideas as Naik does.\" He adds: \"The wave of Islamophobia in the aftermath of 9/11 and the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan have only added to the Muslims' sense of injury. In such a situation, when a debater like Zakir Naik, in eloquent English, takes on preachers of other faiths and defeats them during debates, the Muslims' chests puff with pride. A community nursing a huge sense of betrayal and injustice naturally lionises anyone who gives it a sense of pride. Never mind if it's false pride.\"\n\nAccording to the Art of Living Foundation, Zakir Naik quoted verses from the Vedas out of context and tried to insult Hinduism and other polytheist religions in a debate with its founder – his talk was according to them, \"misguiding and inciting people\".\n\nIndian journalist Khushwant Singh says he \"disagree[s] with almost everything [Naik] has to say about misconceptions about Islam\". Singh argues that Naik's pronouncements are \"juvenile\", and said \"they seldom rise above the level of undergraduate college debates, where contestants vie with each other to score brownie points.\" Singh also says Naik's audiences \"listen to him with rapt attention and often explode in enthusiastic applause when he rubbishes other religious texts\".\n\nTorkel Brekke, a professor of religious history in Norway, calls Naik a \"very controversial figure\" because of his rhetorical attack on other religions and other varieties of Islam. He writes that Naik is \"strongly disliked\" by many members of the Indian \"ulema\" for ignoring their authority and stating that anybody can interpret the Quran. Conservative Deobandi mullahs have accused Naik of \"destroying Islam\" by driving Muslims away from the correct religious authorities.\n\nIn \"Firstpost\", reporter Sreemoy Talukdar wrote, \"The smooth-talking televangelist's regressive and problematic teachings, thoroughly dissected and discussed threadbare, strike at the pluralist cultural component of our existence and promotes a version of Islam that is dreary and incompatible with the modern world.\"\n\nIn \"The Wall Street Journal\", Sadanand Dhume criticised Naik for recommending the death penalty for homosexuals and for apostasy from the faith. He also criticised him for calling for India to be ruled by Shariah law. He added that, according to Naik, Jews \"control America\" and are the \"strongest in enmity to Muslims.\" He maintained that Naik supports a ban on the construction of non-Muslim places of worship in Muslim lands as well as the Taliban's bombing of the Buddhas of Bamiyan. Dhume argues that people reportedly drawn to Naik's message include Najibullah Zazi, the Afghan-American arrested for planning suicide attacks on the New York subway; Rahil Sheikh, accused of involvement in a series of train bombings in Mumbai in 2006; and Kafeel Ahmed, the Bangalore man fatally injured in a failed suicide attack on Glasgow airport in 2007. He also stated that \"unless Indians find the ability to criticise such a radical Islamic preacher as robustly as they would a Hindu equivalent, the ideal of Indian secularism would remain deeply flawed.\"\n\nBangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen described Naik as \"dangerous\" because he \"promotes 7th century Quranic texts on sex slaves, polygamy and wife beating in 21st century\". She said in a series of tweets that, \"I listened to Zakir Naik's speeches. He cites Quranic texts and tries to justify. He's dangerous because it's dangerous to spread 7th century texts in the 21st century\".\n\nDuring a lecture Zakir Naik held on 8 August 2019 in Kota Bharu, Kelantan state, Malaysia, he said that Chinese people living in Malaysia are \"old guests\" who should return to China, suggesting they needed to be forcibly deported out of the country. In the same lecture, he also claimed that Hindus living in Malaysia had \"100 times more rights\" than the Muslim minority in India, and were more loyal to Indian PM Narendra Modi than to Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad. These comments sparked outrage across Malaysian society, being criticised as inciting racial and religious hatred and disrupting the peace and harmony between communities. By 15 August, four government ministers called for revocation of Zakir Naik's permanent residency and for him to be extradited to India. Citizens lodged a total of 115 police complaints against Naik.\n\nOn 16 August, Naik was questioned for about seven hours by the Royal Malaysia Police at Bukit Aman in Kuala Lumpur about his controversial statements, while PM Mahathir said that \"If he is found to be doing detrimental things to the country, it will be necessary for us to take away his permanent resident status. And that case, of course, we may need to take action to prevent him from making such provocative speeches, which attempt to pit the different races against each other,\" adding that a public apology by Naik may not be \"enough to assuage the anger of many people\". Meanwhile, Sarawak, the largest state of Malaysia, banned Zakir Naik from entering the state on 15 August, while the state of Perlis barred him henceforth from speaking at public events on 16 August, followed by the state of Kedah on 17 August; Naik was scheduled to speak in both states. By 20 August, Sabah, Malacca, Penang and Selangor had joined the other three states in prohibiting Naik from speaking in public, thus barring him in 7 out of 13 Malaysian states. After another 10 hour-round of police hearings on 19 August, \"Free Malaysia Today\" reported that on 20 August the police had imposed a nationwide speaking ban on Zakir Naik, which the police confirmed to the \"Malay Mail\".\n\nBy 19 August, Zakir Naik had had his lawyers file legal complaints against five Malaysian politicians for 'defamation', claiming that they had taken his statements out of context and thus unduly damaged his reputation. The next day he maintained that his statements had been taken out of context, but expressed 'heartfelt apologies for this misunderstanding', as it 'was never my intention to upset any individual or community.' The Indian PM Modi had criticized Naik's comments during a dialogue with Mahathir at the Eastern Economic Forum in September.\n\n"}
{"id": "1937705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937705", "title": "Tegel's Mercenaries", "text": "Tegel's Mercenaries\n\nTegel's Mercenaries is a computer game developed by Mindcraft and released in 1992 for MS-DOS. The game is an early entry in the strategy game subgenre of squad-based tactical command.\n\nThe player controls a corporate military officer in the employ of the gruff General Tegel, and battles various criminal forces and alien threats. The player hires and equips a squad of soldiers, each of whom possesses distinct statistical combat specialties, and directs them in combat situations against various hostile humans, robots, and aliens. The game was released without several features that were described in the game's manual and in screenshots, such as intra-squad conflict stemming from divided loyalties and cybernetic upgrades to the soldiers. Furthermore, the game balance was lopsided in favor of the player thanks to poor enemy AI and overpowered weapons. In particular, the flamethrower-type weapons would often deal five times as much damage as a conventional laser weapon, which would have a much higher degree of accuracy.\n\nA sequel, \"Tegel's Mercenaries 2\", was solicited in the Mindscape in-house catalog that was packaged with several contemporary Mindscape games, but it never appeared. However, a direct sequel did appear in the form of Mindscape's final game, \"Strike Squad\", a similar squad-based tactical game whose design improved on many of the shortcomings of \"Tegel's Mercenaries\".\n\nThe game's plot follows the player's exposure of a human conspiracy that leads to a planned invasion by insectoid aliens. Ultimately, the player's squad travels to the aliens' homeworld, destroys their queen (whose design is lifted from the \"Alien\" design), and seemingly thwarts the invasion. Then, in the final cutscene, Tegel reveals himself as an alien in disguise. He was manipulating the player into assisting the aliens all along, and the final mission on their homeworld was supposed to have been a suicide mission. How the unproduced sequel would have followed up on this revelation is unknown.\n\nMindcraft published \"Strike Squad\" later in 1993. Although the publisher, advertisements, box art, and documentation did not mention any connection, \"Computer Gaming World\" stated that \"\"Strike Squad\" is indeed the sequel to \"Tegel's Mercenaries\", completely and directly ... The story follows directly on the heels of development and revelations\" in the earlier game.\n\nWhile approving of \"Tegel's Mercenaries\"s graphics \"Computer Gaming World\" criticized the user interface, collision detection, and combat, calling the latter \"the most frustrating aspect of the game\". The magazine stated of \"Strike Squad\" that \"If you were a fan of \"Tegel\"s, then consider your day made\". It criticized the imbalanced combat and the two-player mode's \"flawed implementation\", concluding that \"All the strengths of its predecessor are included in this un-sequel, but unfortunately most of the weaknesses also remain\". A February 1994 survey of space war games gave both games a grade of C-, stating that \"Tegel's\" had no replay value and AI characters in both games only had \"a rudimentary intelligence\". A May 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave \"Tegel's\" two stars out of five and \"Strike Squad\" one star, stating that \"there are better games of this type out there\".\n"}

It was written by André Bormanis from a story by Manny Coto, and was directed by Mike Vejar. \"The Aenar\" was the third installment of a three-part story which concluded the events of episodes \"Babel One\" and \"\".\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\". In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) travel to Andoria, a moon, seeking the help of the Aenar—an offshoot race of the Andorians—one of whom has been taken by the Romulans to pilot a drone vessel (first seen in the previous episode).\n\nThe episode showed the home world of the Andorians for the first time, with the sets for the planet's ice tunnels being created on a sound stage. Alexandra Lydon and Alicia Adams made their first \"Star Trek\" appearances in \"The Aenar\". Reviews of the episode were mostly negative, with critics citing issues with plot holes and unanswered questions from the story arc. On its first showing, 3.17 million watched the episode.\n\nSenator Vrax (Geno Silva), fresh from the Romulan Senate, is disappointed that Admiral Valdore (Brian Thompson) and scientist Nijil's (J. Michael Flynn) drone program has failed to provoke a rift between Human, Andorian, Vulcan and Tellarite races as they had hoped (seen in \"Babel One\" and \"\"). In fact, the opposite has happened – political discord throughout the Alpha and Beta Quadrants has declined. Now that a second drone vessel is ready to be launched, Valdore suggests a mission against the \"Enterprise\" in order to impress the Senate. Nijil argues that the pilot requires time to recover from his previous exertions, but Valdore insists and prioritizes the mission.\n\nOn \"Enterprise\", analysis of data gathered in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates that the pilot is probably a member of the Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, seems unlikely, since the Aenar are few in number, reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern polar region of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down to contact the Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar do not want to get involved in a war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.\n\nMeanwhile, Doctor Phlox (John Billingsley), Commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), and Commander Charles \"Trip\" Tucker III (Connor Trinneer) work in Sickbay on their own \"telepresence\" unit to help counter the drone ship. T'Pol volunteers to test it, and a concerned Tucker finds it increasingly difficult to balance his duties and emotions. Jhamel then tests the unit, with better results. Later, when the drone ships reappear and attack, she is able to contact the drone pilot, and it is indeed her long-lost brother, who was tricked into working with the Romulans. Learning the deception of his \"helpers\", he turns the drones on each other and both are soon destroyed, and Valdore angrily kills him in retribution. With the threat resolved, the Andorians depart \"Enterprise\" and Tucker requests to leave the ship to join the \"Columbia\".\n\n\"The Aenar\" was the third and final part in the Romulan story arc, comprising \"Babel One\", \"\" and \"The Aenar\". It was written by André Bormanis from a story by show runner Manny Coto. Bormanis had also written \"Babel One\", and earlier in the season the episode \"\", which formed part of the Vulcan story arc. \"The Aenar\" was directed by Mike Vejar, his third episode of the season.\n\nThis episode was the first time the homeworld of the Andorian race was represented on screen. The race had been introduced in the \"\" second-season episode \"Journey to Babel\". The interior of a sound stage was fitted out to appear like caverns on the ice world as it was theorized that this was the environment in which a race such as the Andorians, including the Aenar sub-species, could have evolved. These sets were enhanced in post-production using computer-generated imagery.\n\nFilming began on November 22, 2004, and was completed on December 2, with the production being halted for two days due to Thanksgiving. The majority of the guest stars from earlier installments of the trilogy returned for \"The Aenar\", and they were joined by Alexandra Lydon and Alicia Adams, who were both making their first appearances in a \"Star Trek\" series. Kim Koski was the stunt double for Jeffrey Combs during a scene in which Shran was impaled through the leg by a stalagmite.\n\n\"The Aenar\" was first aired in the United States on UPN on February 11, 2005. It was watched by 3.17 million viewers, which was an increase on the 2.81 million viewers who watched the previous episode. The following episode, \"\", received around the same number of viewers as \"The Aenar\".\n\nMichelle Erica Green, while writing for the website TrekNation, thought that the episode had strong character development despite the other flaws present. She felt that it opened up a number of questions about the abilities of the Andorians due to their similarity to the Aenar, and enjoyed the issues present in the Tucker/T'Pol relationship. Although she said that it was the \"weakest\" of the story arc, it was also the most \"gripping\". Jamahl Epsicokhan, at his website Jammer's Reviews, gave the episode two out of four, adding that \"The Aenar\" was \"aimless\" since the majority of the storyline ended in the previous episode. He found fault with the plot, as the Romulan threat was unspecific, and because of several plot holes which the episode failed to explain.\n\nDavid Greven, in his book \"Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek\", said that the Aenar were an example of the \"uncanny whiteness\" style characters which appear in the franchise which are used to provide a \"denatured form of whiteness\" to the viewer. Other examples of these type of characters include the Borg and the human-like Klingons explained later in season four of \"Enterprise\". He added that the blindness of the Aenar acted as an allegory for the way in which white people are unable to perceive their own whiteness.\n\n\"The Aenar\" was released on home media in the United States on November 1, 2005, as part of the season four DVD box set of \"Enterprise\". The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.\n"}

It was technically similar to Betacam SP, using metal-formulated tape loaded in the cassette, and utilizing component video recording.\n\nMII is sometimes incorrectly referred to as M2; the official name uses Roman numerals, and is pronounced \"em two\". Just as Betacam SP was an improved version of its predecessor Betacam (originally derived from Betamax) with higher video and audio quality, MII was an enhanced development of its predecessor, the failed M format (originally derived from VHS). There were two sizes of MII tape, the larger of which is close to VHS size and has a running time of up to around 90 minutes, the smaller tape was about half the size and runs up to around 20 minutes, and was also the size in which head cleaner tapes were supplied.\n\nPanasonic manufactured mains-powered MII editing and playback decks which accepted both the large and small tapes, as well as portable recorders which used only the small cassette.\n\nUnlike M, MII was somewhat successful when it was first launched, with customers like NBC in the US and NHK in Japan using it for electronic news gathering (ENG), and PBS in the USA using it in the late 1980s to delay their television network programming by 3 hours on broadcast delay for later airing on the West Coast. But MII also suffered from lackluster marketing, a lack of customer support and public relations from Panasonic and Matsushita (Panasonic's parent company), and most importantly, a lack of reliability due to said lack of support for repair and service. This resulted in MII not being nearly as successful as Betacam SP. NBC eventually dropped the format in the early 1990s for Panasonic's D3 Format, and ultimately began broadcasting all of its television programming and television commercials from digital video servers in the 2000s.\n\nIn the UK, MII was used in the late 1980s and early 1990s by three ITV franchisees; Thames Television, Anglia Television and TV-am, whilst all other contemporary broadcasters adopted Sony's Betacam SP. Of the three, Thames and TV-am lost their licences in the 1991 ITV franchise auctions, depleting still further the already scant MII usage in the country.\n\nMII is barely used nowadays, and spare parts as well as tapes for the format are now hard to come by, although used MII equipment can occasionally be found cheaply on the professional video equipment market and online auctions. MII faded earlier than other analog video formats, in favor of digital tapes such as DV, DVCAM and DVCPro, which were themselves superseded by high definition discs and cards. A small number of specialist companies maintain old MII machines in order to offer a transfer service for archive footage to modern formats.\n\nThe MII format was completely analog, with four audio channels. Six tracks were recorded on the tape: two by the moving heads and four by the stationary head.\n\nBeginning at the top of the tape, the first two tracks were audio channels two and one, recorded linearly by the stationary head. Below these were diagonal tracks recorded by the moving head in a method known as helical scan, which increases the effective tape speed and thus the bandwidth needed for storing video. There were two tracks called C and Y, carrying frequency modulated video components. The C track also contained audio channels three and four, frequency modulated. Below the moving head tracks, the last two tracks carried control and time code information, respectively, from the stationary head. The control signal was used to synchronize the moving heads for playback.\n\nVideo was split among the C and Y tracks: Luminance was simply frequency modulated and written solely to the Y track. The two chrominance signals, Pr and Pb, were combined by chrominance time compressed multiplexing (CTCM), which is a type of time division multiplexing. The resulting CTCM signal was frequency modulated and combined with the FM audio carriers, and written to the C track.\n\n\n"}

Apollo Co.\n\nWhite-Smith Music Publishing Company v. Apollo Company, 209 U.S. 1 (1908), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled that manufacturers of music rolls for player pianos did not have to pay royalties to the composers. The ruling was based on a holding that the piano rolls were not copies of the plaintiffs' copyrighted sheet music, but were instead parts of the machine that reproduced the music.\n\nThis case was subsequently eclipsed by Congress's intervention in the form of an amendment to the Copyright Act of 1909, introducing a compulsory license for the manufacture and distribution of such \"mechanical\" embodiments of musical works. \nThe main issue was whether or not something had to be directly perceptible (meaning intelligible to an ordinary human being) for it to be a \"copy.\" Naturally, hardly anyone could perceive (read) music by looking at a roll of paper with holes in it. The 1976 Copyright Act later clarified the issue, defining a \"copy\" as a \"material object . . . in which a work is fixed . . . and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, \"either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\"\" This case remains relevant because the 1976 Copyright Act makes an \"otherwise inexplicable distinction between 'copies' and 'phonorecords.'\"\n\nPerhaps the greatest relevance of \"White-Smith\", however, is that it foreshadowed the debate over whether object code (computer program code in the form of 0s and 1s encoded in a magnetic tape or disc or in an EPROM) was protected by US copyright law. In the early 1980s the issue was in considerable doubt, and initially several lower court decisions held that object code was not a \"copy\" of a computer program. Two court of appeals decisions involving copying of Apple computers and their software were influential in reversing the tide. They upheld the protectability of object code embodiments of computer programs and rejected the supposed requirement that a candidate for status as a work of authorship must communicate a message to human readers or perceivers. These decisions wrote the human-intelligibility requirement of \"White-Smith\" out of copyright law, as a qualification for investiture of copyright, although the \"piano-roll amendment\" had only established that human-intelligibility was not a requirement for an infringing \"copy.\" In principle, what infringes could be broader than what gives rise to copyright, on the theory that works of authorship need a hedge or moat around them to assure adequate protection. But that does not appear to be the law.\n\nThe \"White-Smith\" case also appears to be the source of a legal metaphor used in US patent law relating to computer programs. As explained in greater detail in the Wikipedia article Piano Roll Blues, the legal fiction developed in US patent law that placing a new program in an old general-purpose digital computer creates a new computer and thus a \"new machine\" for purposes of section 101 of the US patent statute (listing patent-eligible subject matter). Critics of this argument derisively termed it the \"Old Piano Roll Blues,\" meaning that the argument was equivalent to asserting that placing a new piano roll into an old player piano transformed it into a new player piano. The 2014 decision of the United States Supreme Court in \"Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International\" appears to have extinguished the Piano roll blues argument by holding that simply saying “apply it with a computer” will not transform a patent-ineligible claim to an idea into a patent-eligible claim.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1937729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937729", "title": "Matthew 2:23", "text": "Matthew 2:23\n\nMatthew 2:23 is the twenty-third (and the last) verse of the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. The young Jesus and the Holy Family have just returned from Egypt and in this verse are said to settle in Nazareth. This is the final verse of Matthew's infancy narrative.\n\nMatthew ends the verse arguing that Jesus' life in Nazareth fulfilled a messianic prophecy, which he quotes: \"\"He will be called a Nazarene.\"\" However, no such prophecy is found in the Old Testament, or any other extant source. Because of this, the verse has been much studied, and various theories have been advanced attempting to explain the enigmatic quote.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the Authorized King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions, see BibleHub Matthew 2:23.\n\nNazareth was a small village unmentioned in any writings before this time, though there is some archeological evidence that a village existed in the area at the time of Jesus. The word \"town\" is from the Greek \"polis\", which is used both for a big city such as Jerusalem and quite small settlements. Matthew gives no specific reason for why the family moved to this town except for the prophecy fulfillment and does not show any knowledge that Luke has them originally from there. The town was near the Via Maris, the main road connecting to Egypt, and the route the family would have most likely been travelling.\n\nClarke notes that Nazareth was just to the north of the larger centre of Sepphoris that had been largely destroyed in the violence after the death of Herod the Great. At this time it was being rebuilt by Herod Antipas, and Clarke speculates that this could have been a source of employment for a carpenter such as Joseph. Nazareth could have had a population somewhere between 100 and 2000 people in the first century AD, and was quickly overshadowed by Sepphoris, which is only four miles away.\n\nJerome indicates that \"Nazareth\" was used in reference to Old Testament verses using the Hebrew word \"ne'tser\" (branch), specifically citing . The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" notes that, \"The etymology of Nazara is \"netser\", which means 'a shoot'. The Vulgate renders this word by \"flos\", 'flower', in the Prophecy of Isaias (11:1), which is applied to the Saviour. St. Jerome (Epist., xlvi, 'Ad Marcellam') gives the same interpretation to the name of the town.\"\n\nThe difficulty with the brief quote \"he will be called a Nazarene\" is that it occurs nowhere in the Old Testament prophets, or any other extant source. A number of theories have been advanced to explain this. At the time the canon was not firmly established and it is possible that Matthew is quoting some lost source, but all the other quotations in Matthew are from well known works, and if a quotation so closely linking Jesus’ hometown and the Messiah existed it would likely have been preserved.\n\nThere is much debate, and many theories among scholars as to what the quote could mean. Scholars have searched through the Old Testament for passages that are similar. One popular suggestion is Judges 13:5 where of Samson it says \"the child shall be a 'Nazirite'\" ( \"\"; LXX: ναζιραιος, \"naziraios\"). A nazirite was a member of a sect who practiced asceticism, and the word has no known link to the name of the town. Jesus was not a nazirite and is never described as one. France also notes that Judges has \"shall be\" while Matthew has \"shall be called\", so if Matthew had been quoting Judges he would have retained the same form.\n\nAnother theory is that it is based on Isaiah 53:2. This messianic reference states that \"he grew up before him like a tender shoot.\" One of the Hebrew words for \"shoot\" is \"netser\" ( \"\"; cf. ), more similar to the word \"nazarene\" (Hebrew: \"netsri\"; Greek: , \"Nazōraios\") than \"nazirite\" ( \"nezîr\"). Keener notes that the term is used to refer to the Messiah in the Dead Sea Scrolls. However this piece of wordplay is meaningless in Greek. Goulder feels that the author of Matthew felt it essential that Jesus' hometown be justified in prophecy and he thus looked for the closest thing he could find, which was this verse. However, the main problem with this argument is that the Hebrew word for \"shoot\" in verse 53:2 is not \"natsir\" but \"yowneq\" which further complicates the issue.\n\nThis verse refers to prophets in the plural, unlike all of Matthew's other references to known Old Testament prophets, which use the singular. This could imply that the wordplay and multiple interpretations was intentional. Rothfuchs reads the plural as the author of Matthew referring to all the quotes so far in the Gospel that directed the Holy Family in travels. To him the line is thus not a direct quote from the prophets, but the inevitable end the previous directions led to.\n\nFrance states that Matthew sees Nazareth, as an obscure city, causes the term \"Nazarene\" to be understood as an insulting epithet (cf. ), an unflattering reference to Jesus' humble and obscure origins that was used by anti-Christians at the time. The word is used in just such a way at Matthew 26:71. Thus to France, the meaning of the verse is that Jesus fulfill the prophecies that the Messiah will be abused and neglected (cf. Psalm 22, Isaiah 53, ), a prevalent current in Jewish messianic thinking that was just as active as the belief that the Messiah would be an all-conquering hero. Gundry point out that the wordplay \"netzer\" in conveys the same message by depicting the Messiah as a shoot from a cut-down stump to be a symbol of lowly origin, as so understood by the Jewish at that time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1937731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937731", "title": "Sport bike", "text": "Sport bike\n\nA sportbike, or sports bike, is a motorcycle optimized for speed, acceleration, braking, and cornering on paved roads, typically at the expense of comfort and fuel economy by comparison with other motorcycles. Soichiro Honda wrote in the owner's manual of the 1959 Honda CB92 Benly Super Sport that, \"Primarily, essentials of the motorcycle consists in the speed and the thrill,\" while \"Cycle World's\" Kevin Cameron says that, \"A sportbike is a motorcycle whose enjoyment consists mainly from its ability to perform on all types of paved highway – its cornering ability, its handling, its thrilling acceleration and braking power, even (dare I say it?) its speed.\"\n\nMotorcycles are versatile and may be put to many uses as the rider sees fit. In the past there were few if any specialized types of motorcycles, but the number of types and sub-types has proliferated, particularly in the period since the 1950s. The introduction of the Honda CB750 in 1969 marked a dramatic increase in the power and speed of practical and affordable sport bikes available to the general public. This was followed in the 1970s by improvements in suspension and braking commensurate with the power of the large inline fours that had begun to dominate the sport bike world. In the 1980s sport bikes again took a leap ahead, becoming almost indistinguishable from racing motorcycles. Since the 1990s sport bikes have become more diverse, adding new variations like the naked bike and streetfighter to the more familiar road racing style of sport bike.\n\nWith the emphasis of a sport bike being on speed, acceleration, braking, and maneuverability, there are certain design elements that most motorcycles of this type will share. Rider ergonomics favor function. This generally means higher foot pegs that move the legs closer to the body and more of a reach to a lower set of hand controls, such as clip on handlebars, which positions the body and weight forward and over the tank. Sport bikes have comparatively high-performance engines resting inside a lightweight frame. High tech and expensive materials are often used on sport bikes to reduce weight.\n\nBraking systems combine higher performance brake pads and disc brakes with multi-piston calipers that clamp onto oversized vented rotors. Suspension systems are advanced in terms of adjustments and materials for increased stability and durability. Front and rear tires are larger and wider than tires found on other types of motorcycles to allow higher cornering speeds and greater lean angles. Fairings may or may not be used on a sport bike; when used, fairings are shaped to reduce aerodynamic drag as much as possible and provide wind protection for the rider.\n\nThe combination of rider position, location of the engine and other heavy components, and the motorcycle's geometry help maintain structural integrity and chassis rigidity, and determine how it will behave under acceleration, braking, and cornering. Correct front-to-rear weight distribution is of particular importance to the handling of sport bikes, and the changing position of the rider's body dynamically changes the handling of the motorcycle. Because of the complexity of modeling all the possible movements of different sized riders, to approach perfect tuning of a motorcycle's weight distribution and suspension is often only possible by having a bike customized or at least adjusted to fit a specific rider. Generally, road racing style sport bikes have shorter wheelbases than those intended for more comfortable touring, and the current trend in sport bike design is towards shorter wheelbases, giving quicker turning at the expense of a greater tendency for unintentional wheelies and stoppies under hard acceleration and braking, respectively. Some motorcycles have anti-wheelie systems, with various designs including computerized traction and suspension settings controls or mechanical suspension features, which are intended to reduce the lift and loss of traction of the front wheel under acceleration.\n\nThere is no universal authority defining the terminology of sport bikes or any other motorcycle classes. Legal definitions are limited by local jurisdiction, and race sanctioning bodies like the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) and the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) set rules that only apply to those who choose to participate in their competitions. Nonetheless, by present day standards in Europe, North America and the rest of the developed world, sport bikes are usually divided into three, four, or five rough categories, reflecting vaguely similar engine displacement, horsepower, price and intended use, with a good measure of subjective opinion and simplification. Marketing messages about a model from the manufacturer can diverge from the consensus of the motorcycling media and the public. Sometimes the classes used in motorcycle racing are approximated in production models, often but not always in connection with homologation.\n\nThe sport bike classes in common usage are:\nThe terms supersport and superbike are sometimes applied indiscriminately to all high-performance motorcycles. Categorization by engine displacement alone is a crude measure, particularly when comparing engines with different numbers of cylinders like inline or V fours with parallel and V twins, not to mention the greater power for a given displacement of two-stroke engines over four strokes.\n\nIn the less developed world, smaller engine sizes are the norm, and relative terms like small, mid-sized and large displacement can have different meanings. For example, in India in 2002 there were about 37 million two-wheelers, but as of 2008, there were only about 3,000 motorcycles, or fewer than one in 12,000, of displacement or more. Similarly, the perception of relative sizes has shifted over time in developed countries, from smaller to larger displacements. When the original superbike, the Honda CB750, appeared in 1969, it was called a \"big four,\" while today an inline four of would be classed in the middle range.\n\nBesides having product lines that span from entry level through high end sport bikes, many manufacturers add depth to that line by having pairs, or several pairs, of similar sport bikes aimed at riders of different levels. These are designed to appeal to riders seeking more or less extreme performance features. The more expensive model will be in the vein of a race replica, offering the latest technology updated with frequent design revisions, while the lower cost model typically relies on older technology, can have a more relaxed riding position, and is generally more practical for non-road racing tasks such as urban commuting and carrying passengers or baggage, and offering lower fuel, insurance and maintenance costs. Examples of these paired models are Buell's Firebolt and Lightning, Ducati's 916/748 through 1198/848 paired series, Honda's CBR600RR and F4i middleweights and RC51 and CBR1000RR liter-class, several different concurrent models in Kawasaki's Ninja line, and Yamaha's R6 and 600R.\n\nSport touring motorcycles share many features of sport bikes, but they are generally considered a class all their own. These are mid- to large-sized motorcycles that offer more carrying capacity, more relaxed ergonomics, and more versatility than specialized sport bikes, while being lighter and more agile than touring motorcycles.\n\nSome sport bikes are marketed as race replicas, implying that the model sold to the public is identical to the one used in racing, or at least is closer to the racing version than non-replica models. Suffixes \"R\" or \"RR\" applied to model codes can be interpreted as standing for replica or race replica. \"Race Replica\" was used in the late 1970s UK where 250 cc models customized with full bodykits providing race-styling in factory team colors themed to the top-level of sponsored riders of the time were available marketed towards 'learner' riders who had not passed a driving test enabling their progression to large-capacity machines. In 1982 Yamaha described their 1983 RD350 YPVS launched at the Cologne motorcycle show as \"the nearest thing to a road going racer ever produced\".\n\nThe term race replica was then also used to distinguish the period of sport bike production from Japan and Europe since the mid-1980s having integrated race-styled bodywork, representing an evolution from the superbike period that began in 1969. The sport bike, or race replica, era began with the 1983 Suzuki RG250 Gamma, the 1984 Honda VF750F and the 1985 Suzuki GSX-R750, and had full fairings. Sport bikes with small or no fairings have proliferated since the mid-1990s. These are called naked bikes or streetfighters, and they retain many of the performance features of other sport bikes, but besides abbreviated bodywork, they give the rider a more upright posture by using, for example, higher handlebars instead of clip ons. The streetfighter name, associated with motorcycle stunt riding and perhaps hooliganism on public roads, can imply higher performance than the sometimes more tame naked bike, which in some cases is a synonym for a standard motorcycle. Others define naked bikes as equal in power and performance to sport bikes, merely absent the bodywork.\n\nThe same period that saw the naked and streetfighter variants of the sport bike theme also had a resurgence of the versatile standard in response to demand for a return of the Universal Japanese Motorcycle. Supermoto-style street bikes, constructed with a completely different set of priorities than a road racing style sport bike, have also entered the mainstream, offering another option for riders seeking a spirited riding experience. The nickname muscle bike has been applied to sport bikes that give engine output a disproportionate priority over braking, handling or aerodynamics, harking back to the Japanese superbikes of the 1970s. A similar sensibility drives the so-called power cruiser motorcycles, based on cruiser class machines but with horsepower numbers in league with superbikes.\n\n"}

He was the younger brother of Somkhanda kaZiguda Jele who remained with the Gumbi clan in Kwazulu Natal in areas of Pongola and . After being driven from the eastern region of what is now South Africa, near modern Swaziland, by the Zulus during the Mfecane, Zwangendaba led his people, then called the \"Jele\", on a migration of more than lasting more than twenty years. Their journey took them through the areas now known as Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi to the western part of Tanzania, where Zwangendaba set up a base at Mapupo. The Ngoni, once a small tribe, extended their dominion even further through present-day Tanzania, Malawi, and Zambia when they fragmented into five separate groups following his death. \n\nZwangendaba was a leader of a section of the Ngoni people who broke away from the rule of Shaka the Zulu king. Using many of Shaka's methods of rule such as rigid discipline in military and social organisation, he knitted his tribe and the unfortunate people abducted along the way into a cohesive unit. With his people he migrated north into tropical Africa, and is believed to have destroyed many of the structures at Great Zimbabwe on passing through. The migration proceeded across the Zambezi in 1835 on a day when there was a total eclipse of the sun. Advancing north, ravaging the countries they crossed, they eventually arrived in the south west of what is now Tanzania. On the death of Zwangendaba, the Ngoni split into three groups, one settling in Malawi, one in Songea (Tanzania) and a third group migrated north to Mbogwe in Usumbwa where they fought with the famous Mirambo of Unyamwezi.\n\n"}
{"id": "1937745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937745", "title": "Critical hit", "text": "Critical hit\n\nIn many role-playing games and video games, a critical hit (or crit) is a chance that a successful attack will deal more damage than a normal blow.\n\nThe 1975 role-playing game \"Empire of the Petal Throne\" introduced the concept of critical hits (though not the phrase). Using these rules a player who rolls a 20 on a 20 sided die does double the normal damage, and a 20 followed by a 19 or 20 counts as a killing blow. According to creator M.A.R. Barker, \"this simulates the 'lucky hit' on a vital organ.\"\n\nCritical hits are meant to simulate an occasional \"lucky hit\". The concept represents the effect of hitting an artery, or finding a weak point, such as a stab merely in the leg causing less damage than a stab in the Achilles tendon. Critical hits are almost always random, although character attributes or situational modifiers may come into play. For example, games in which the player characters have a \"Luck\" attribute will often base the likelihood of critical hits occurring on this statistic: a character with high Luck will deal a higher percentage of critical hits, while a character with low Luck may, in some games, be struck by more critical hits. In the role playing game \"Dungeons & Dragons\", when a player character attacks an opponent the player typically rolls a 20-sided die; a roll of 20 (a 5% chance) results in a critical hit.\n\nThe most common kind of critical hit simply deals additional damage, most commonly dealing double the normal damage that would have been dealt, but many other formulas exist as well (such as ignoring defense of the target or always awarding the maximum possible damage). Critical hits also occasionally do \"special damage\" to represent the effects of specific wounds (for example, losing use of an arm or eye, or being reduced to a limp). Critical hits usually occur only with normal weapon attacks, not with magic or other special abilities, but this depends on the individual game's rules.\n\nMany table-top and video games use \"ablative\" hit point systems. That is, wounded characters often have no game differences from unwounded characters other than a reduction in hit points. Critical hits originally provided a way to simulate wounds to a specific part of the body. These systems usually use lookup charts and other mechanics to determine which wound was inflicted. In RPGs with non-humanoid characters or monsters, unlikely or bizarre results could occur, such as a Beholder with a \"lost leg\". Most systems now simply award extra damage on a critical hit, trading realism for ease of play. The effect of a critical hit is to break up the monotony of a battle with high, unusual results.\n\nIn the Brazilian RPG \"Tagmar\", according to the result of a dice roll, the victim of a critical hit is significantly wounded or even instantly killed (regardless of hit points).\n\nThe roleplaying game \"Rolemaster\" is known for its extended system of criticals. One long standing claim from its company ICE is that it is not the normal hits that kill, but the critical. By integrating criticals even on low results by varying the critical severity (from A (minor) - J (extreme)) and the large variety of criticals (e.g. Slash, Krush, Puncture, Heat, Cold, Electricity, Impact, Unarmed Strikes and even some bizarre ones such as Internal Disruption and Essence criticals) every combat plays out differently. Critical results vary from simple additional hits, and added bleeding and stuns to limbs lopped off and internal organs destroyed. Player characters are not immune to the effects of a critical hit in this system.\n\nMany games call critical hits by other names. For example, in \"Chrono Trigger\", a double hit is a normal attack in which a player character strikes an enemy twice in the same turn. The \"EarthBound\" series refers to critical hits as a smash hit (known in-game as \"SMAAAASH!!\"). The American NES release of \"Dragon Warrior II\" referred to an enemy's critical hits as \"heroic attacks\". In the \"Mario & Luigi\" subseries, critical hits are known as \"lucky hits\", whereas the word \"critical\" is instead used for attacks that are elementally effective (e.g. fire against plants). Players frequently use the abbreviation crit or critical for \"critical hit\".\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" uses a Critical and \"Mini-Crit\" system. Criticals deal three times the normal damage (and are not weaker at long range, unlike most damage), whereas \"mini-crits\" only increase damage by 35%. In addition to most weapons having a random chance to crit, some weapons have mechanics that guarantee them when used correctly, such as sniping weapons being capable of headshots (see below).\n\nThe negative counterpart of the critical hit is variously known as the critical miss, critical fumble, or critical failure. The concept is less frequently borrowed than that of critical hits. Many tabletop role-playing games use some variation on this concept (such as a \"botch\" in the Storyteller System), but few computer role-playing games implement critical misses except where the game is directly based on a tabletop game in which such rules appear. Video games are more likely to have a separate system for determining whether attacks miss, using mechanics such as accuracy and evasion.\n\nIn first person shooter games such as \"\", \"Tactical Ops\", and \"Unreal Tournament\", the concept of a critical hit is often substituted by the headshot, where a player attempts to place a shot on an opposed player or non-player character's head area or other weak-spot, which is generally fatal, or otherwise devastating, when successfully placed. Headshots require considerable accuracy as players often have to compensate for target movement and a very specific area of the enemy's body. In some games, even when the target is stationary, the player may have to compensate for movement generated by the telescopic sight.\n\nThe first commercial game to make use of them was \"GoldenEye 007\" for the Nintendo 64, however headshots and other location based damage for humanoid type creatures first appeared in the original \"Team Fortress\" modification for \"Quake\" released the same year, although they were demonstrated and tested in a standalone \"TF Sniper\" \"modification\" created by the same team earlier that year.\n"}
{"id": "1937751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937751", "title": "Babel One", "text": "Babel One\n\n\"Babel One\" is the twelfth episode of the of the American science fiction television series \"\", and originally aired on January 28, 2005. The episode was written by Mike Sussman and André Bormanis, and directed by David Straiton. \"Babel One\" was the first of a three-part story which continued in the episodes \"\" and \"The Aenar\". The arc was intended to precede the Romulan War which had been mentioned in previously aired episodes of the franchise, while \"Babel One\" was a reference to the \"\" episode \"Journey to Babel\".\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. In this episode, \"Enterprise\" is escorting a Tellarite Ambassador, when they respond to distress calls from Andorian vessel under attack. Pursuing the mysterious attacking vessel, they begin to uncover a plot to derail cooperative relations between the Tellarites, Andorians and Humans.\n\nThe guest cast included several actors who had previously appeared in the franchise, including Lee Arenberg, Brian Thompson and Jeffrey Combs. It also featured Molly Brink for the second time as Lieutenant Talas. The episode required extensive make-up for the guest cast, with Brink undergoing more than four and a half hours of work prior to filming for her first day on set as she had to be painted blue head to toe in addition to the normal prosthetics. Reviewers were positive of the episode, calling it an improvement on the previous week's \"\", and praised the ending. Although Nielsen ratings of 1.7/3 percent showed an improvement over the previous episode, the number of actual viewers was the lowest yet for the series with 2.53 million watching the episode on the first broadcast.\n\nIt is November 2154, and Captain Archer and Ensign Sato spend time preparing for the arrival of Ambassador Gral and the Tellarite delegation, by practicing being blunt, complaining, and arguing. En route to the trade summit on \"Babel One\", they detect a distress call from the Andorian warship, \"Kumari\", now under attack. \"Enterprise\" alters its course to assist, and arrives to find Commander Shran, Lieutenant , and 17 other survivors in escape-pods. Archer goes to meet him in Sickbay, and an angry Shran claims that both the Andorian Ambassador's and his ship were attacked and destroyed by a powerful Tellarite vessel.\n\nScans of the debris indicate Tellarite weapon signatures, and recovered sensor data shows a Tellarite vessel firing. With both delegations on board, and accusations of duplicity rising between the groups, Archer considers taking the Andorians to their homeworld. At full warp, \"Enterprise\" is suddenly attacked by an Andorian ship. When attempts at communicating fail, Archer demands that Shran intervenes — he complies by explaining how to knock out its shields — but the attempt is ineffective. \"Enterprise\" is spared only when the attacking ship has to retreat because of a fluctuating power grid. T'Pol then notices that the \"Andorian\" and \"Tellarite\" ships have the same energy signature. The alien vessel is then tracked, and it appears to be capable of holographically disguising itself. Shran is unconvinced, and using Talas as a distraction, manages to escape and capture Gral, before order is restored. However, when Archer convinces Shran to examine the evidence, a member of the Tellarite delegation is able to wrest a weapon from Talas, and shoots her.\n\nMeanwhile, Commander Tucker, Lieutenant Malcolm Reed and two MACOs beam aboard the ship, only to find it deserted and without life support. Although the MACOs are beamed back, the transporter is damaged before Tucker and Reed can be rescued. They are able to locate an oxygen supply within the ship's systems, but become stranded when the vessel warps away, and make their way to an empty bridge. On Romulus, it is revealed that the ship is actually a drone, controlled by a pilot under the command of Romulan Admiral Valdore, supported by a scientist called Nijil, in an attempt to prevent a regional détente.\n\nThe episode was written by Mike Sussman and André Bormanis. The duo had previously collaborated on several episodes, the most recent of which season three's \"\". Meanwhile, they had written episodes individually, with Sussman writing three episodes so far during season four and Bormanis penning \"\". \"Babel One\" was directed by David Straiton, his third in season four after the second part of \"\" as well as the stand-alone episode \"\".\n\nFilming began on November 2, 2004 and lasted until November 10. The first scene filmed was on the Andorian bridge, which had been used in previous episodes but was made to look battle damaged for this episode. Other sets used included the standing sets to represent the \"Enterprise\", as well as new sets showing the interior of the Romulan vessel. The title of the episode was an intentional reference to the \"\" episode \"Journey to Babel\". The three part story was intended to represent a precursor to the Romulan Wars which had been referenced in \"Balance of Terror\" and \"\".\n\nThe guest cast included a number of \"Star Trek\" alumni. Jeffrey Combs returned to his recurring role of Shran, for his second appearance during season four. Joining him as a returning Andorian was Molly Brink, who had previously appeared as Talas in the episode \"\". Brian Thompson played the Romulan Valdore, having previously appeared in \"\" and \"\" as well as the film \"Star Trek Generations\". He is better known for portraying the Alien Bounty Hunter in \"The X-Files\" and Luke, a vampire who becomes The Master's \"vessel\" in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Another \"Deep Space Nine\" actor who portrayed a new character in this episode was Lee Arenberg. He had previously appeared in a variety of roles across the franchise, three times as a Ferengi in \"The Next Generation\" and \"Deep Space Nine\" (including one, coincidentally also named Gral, no relation to the Tellarite Gral he plays here). He also appeared as a Malon, Pelk, in the \"\" episode \"\".\n\nThe guest cast required a variety of levels of make-up to portray their alien characters. Combs' make-up took around three and a half hours each day, as did the Tellarite prosthetics. The Andorian female cast members took around four and a half hour each day to get into make-up and costume, but on the first day Brink required further make-up time as that day's shoot required her to appear in-character in her underwear. This meant that after the normal make-up schedule, she was sprayed blue from head to toe. At the end of that day's filming, the shower facilities at the studio's executive gym were used to remove the paint. Meanwhile, the Romulan make-up took three hours to apply, with all the relevant scenes completed in a single day.\n\n\"Babel One\" was first aired in the United States on UPN on January 28, 2005. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 1.7/3 percent. This means that it was seen by 1.7 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was an increase in ratings compared to the previous week's episode, but saw a lower overall number of viewers. \"Babel One\" was watched by 2.53 million viewers, the lowest overall number of viewers to date for a first run episode of \"Enterprise\".\n\nMichelle Erica Green in her review for TrekNation enjoyed the interaction between Shran and Graal, and thought it was an improvement over the previous week's \"\". She also compared it to \"The Original Series\" episode \"Journey to Babel\", which she watched immediately prior to the \"Enterprise\" episode. She said that \"On the surface \"Babel One\" has a very similar plot, yet it plays out like an original take on the situation rather than a retread.\" Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website Jammer's Reviews thought that the majority of the episode was \"passable\" but ultimately ended on a \"good note\" due to the twist in the ending. However, he criticised the promotional campaign by UPN, as he felt that the trailer for the episode had the \"unfortunate effect of making the first 30 minutes of the plot extremely obvious to us, forcing us to watch in frustration while the characters put the pieces together\". He gave the episode a rating of three out of four.\n\nThe first home media release of the episode was on DVD; having been released as part of the season four box set on November 1, 2005 in the United States. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.\n\n"}

A cassette that would yield 120 minutes on a VHS VCR at SP speed would only yield 20 minutes on a M VCR. \n\nThe format was called \"M\" due to the shape of the threading path of the tape around the helical scan video head drum, which resembles a letter M.

The character-driven storyline focuses primarily on the psychology of the main character, her social interactions, her inhuman abilities, and the conspiracy surrounding them. The technology is often secondary to this, but it is not ignored; several aspects, including their means of faster-than-light travel, are explained and loosely based on modern physics.\n\nThe series was a hit in Japan, which led to the creation of a sequel, \"Misaki Chronicles\", which also ran for 13 episodes.\n\nIn North America, the television series was initially licensed by ADV Films and was released in three volumes on VHS and DVD. Sentai Filmworks re-released the series in a box set, including \"Misaki Chronicles\".\n\nIn the year 2017, a satellite on Earth detects a gravitational imbalance in the direction of Lyra, initially believed to be a black hole. Its suspicious X-ray emissions are subjected to noise removal algorithms, revealing the voice message recorded aboard a fictional future Voyager spacecraft, still in the solar system. Before the cause can be determined, additional identical signals are detected throughout the year from other distant gravity-based phenomena. This is considered proof of faster-than-light travel, and the wormhole responsible is pinpointed to be in the core of Saturn's moon Titan. By temporarily entering a \"baby universe\" still in a state of cosmic inflation, the signal was able to bypass the known laws of physics and travel at infinite speed. The wormholes themselves became known as \"Inflation Holes\".\n\nHuman travel follows almost two centuries later in 2197. With a tunnel dug into Titan's depths, and a prototype \"Inflation Drive\" on board, two astronauts make the first manned faster-than-light voyage, traveling almost three parsecs. Further exploration of Inflation Holes finds a planet 10 parsecs away with a wormhole core similar to Titan's, formerly inhabited by an extinct alien species. The planet is in a bizarre \"apple core\" shape, with all of the equatorial planetary mass consumed by frequent alien use of Inflation Drive technology. Three giant longitudinal rings surround what is dubbed as the \"Quantum Core\", and ruins exist upon the fragmented Core itself, but electromagnetic radiation inside the Core is severely limited, making exploration slow and difficult.\n\nBy 2246, a base has been built on the planet and dubbed \"Watcher's Nest\". A 12-member expedition is in progress when an unscheduled arrival is detected by command, but the expedition is already inside the Core and radio signals cannot reach them to deliver the recall order. The expedition team thereby encounters their first \"Ghoul\" and are wiped out. Later encounters also follow. Autopsies in 2252 by a group called \"Alchemy\" reveal artificial genetic modifications, and these genes become the main focus of research into the Ghoul. When applied to monkeys, the genes expand the scope of the animal's senses, but scientists cannot determine how or why.\n\nAfter two decades of research, by 2272, one of the lead scientists, Doctor Kessler, is frustrated with the project's slow progress on animals. Believing the gene sequences to be a message from an advanced alien species, he leads the effort to begin creating genetically modified humans, to witness the effect on humans as the Ghoul intended. In 2275, Alchemy objects to the use of human guinea pigs, and officially shuts the project down—but not before at least one test subject and one of the only successful Human/Ghoul hybrids is removed by persons unknown.\n\n\n\"Divergence Eve\" takes place on Watcher's Nest, now effectively a giant space station built inside the planet halves with a population of ten million. The first episode is actually set between episodes 12 and 13, but is played first with no explanation in order to build viewer curiosity and provide strong foreshadowing.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1937788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937788", "title": "Marid", "text": "Marid\n\nMarid ( \"\") is a type of Shaitan in Islamic traditions. The Arabic word meaning \"rebellious\" is applied to such supernatural beings.\n\nThe word \"mārid\" is an active participle of the root \"m-r-d\" (مرد), whose primary meaning is \"recalcitrant, rebellious\". \"Lisān al-`arab\", the encyclopedic dictionary of classical Arabic compiled by Ibn Manzur, reports only forms of this general meaning. It is found as an attribute of evil spirits in the Qur'an (aṣ-Ṣāffāt, 37:7), which speaks of a \"safeguard against every rebellious devil\" (شَيْطَانٍ مَارِدٍ, \"shaitān mārid\"). From the same Semitic root come the Hebrew words \"Mered\" (מרד \"rebellion\") and \"Mored\" (מורד \"rebel\"). \n\nThe Wehr-Cowan dictionary of modern written Arabic also gives secondary meanings of \"demon\" and \"giant\". Lane's \"Arabic-English Lexicon\" cites a source where it \"\"is said to be applied to an evil jinnee of the most powerful class\"\", but this distinction is not universal. For example, in the standard MacNaghten edition of \"One Thousand and One Nights\" one finds the words \"marid\" and \"ifrit\" used interchangeably (e.g., in \"The Story of the Fisherman\").\n\nA mārid is explicitly mentioned in Sirat Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan. Accordingly, Sayf demands from the marid to lead him to Solomon's hoard. But following their nature, the demon does the exact opposite of that he was commanded. Later he learned from Khidr, he must command the opposite of that he desires him to do.\n\nIn Jonathan Stroud's \"Bartimaeus Sequence\" novel series, marids are the most powerful type of demons summoned by magicians.\n\nIn S. A. Chakraborty's \"Daevabad Trilogy,\" the marid are elemental creatures created from water. These creatures are said to be extremely powerful and had not been seen for centuries at the time of the first book in the series, \"The City of Brass\".\n\nIn the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" tabletop game, marids are genies from the Elemental Plane of Water.\n\nIn the Fairyland (series) stories by Catherynne M. Valente, marids are sea beings who eat rocks and salt and who have the power to grant wishes, but only to someone who can wrestle them to submission.\n\nThe Marid is featured in Episode 7 \"Last Call\" of \"Supernatural\" Season 15.\n\n"}

{"id": "1937800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937800", "title": "Substitution model", "text": "Substitution model\n\nIn biology, a substitution model describes the process from which a sequence of symbols changes into another set of traits. For example, in cladistics, each position in the sequence might correspond to a property of a species which can either be present or absent. The alphabet could then consist of \"0\" for absence and \"1\" for presence. Then the sequence 00110 could mean, for example, that a species does not have feathers or lay eggs, does have fur, is warm-blooded, and cannot breathe underwater. Another sequence 11010 would mean that a species has feathers, lays eggs, does not have fur, is warm-blooded, and cannot breathe underwater. In phylogenetics, sequences are often obtained by firstly obtaining a nucleotide or protein sequence alignment, and then taking the bases or amino acids at corresponding positions in the alignment as the characters. Sequences achieved by this might look like AGCGGAGCTTA and GCCGTAGACGC.\n\nSubstitution models are used, for example, for constructing evolutionary trees in phylogenetics or cladistics, and simulating sequences to test other methods and algorithms.\n\nMost substitution models used to date are neutral, independent, finite sites models. Neutral sites mean selection does not operate on the substitutions, and so they are unconstrained. Independent sites mean changes in one site do not affect the probability of changes in another site. Finite sites are finitely many sites, and so over evolution, a single site can be changed multiple times. This means that, for example, if a character has value 0 at time 0 and at time \"t\", it could be that no changes occurred, or that it changed to a 1 and back to a 0, or that it changed to a 1 and back to a 0 and then to a 1 and then back to a 0, and so on.\n\nTypically, a branch length of a phylogenetic tree is expressed as the expected number of substitutions per site; if the evolutionary model indicates that each site within an ancestral sequence will typically experience \"x\" substitutions by the time it evolves to a particular descendant's sequence then the ancestor and descendant are considered to be separated by branch length \"x\".\n\nSometimes a branch length is measured in terms of geological years. For example, a fossil record may make it possible to determine the number of years between an ancestral species and a descendant species. Because some species evolve at faster rates than others, these two measures of branch length are not always in direct proportion. The expected number of substitutions per site per year is often indicated with the Greek letter mu (μ).\n\nA model is said to have a strict molecular clock if the expected number of substitutions per year μ is constant regardless of which species' evolution is being examined. An important implication of a strict molecular clock is that the number of expected substitutions between an ancestral species and any of its present-day descendants must be independent of which descendant species is examined.\n\nNote that the assumption of a strict molecular clock is often unrealistic, especially across long periods of evolution. For example, even though rodents are genetically very similar to primates, they have undergone a much higher number of substitutions in the estimated time since divergence in some regions of the genome. This could be due to their shorter generation time, higher metabolic rate, increased population structuring, increased rate of speciation, or smaller body size. When studying ancient events like the Cambrian explosion under a molecular clock assumption, poor concurrence between cladistic and phylogenetic data is often observed. There has been some work on models allowing variable rate of evolution.\n\nModels that can take into account variability of the rate of the molecular clock between different evolutionary lineages in the phylogeny are called “relaxed” in opposition to “strict”. In such models the rate can be assumed to be correlated or not between ancestors and descendants and rate variation among lineages can be drawn from many distributions but usually exponential and lognormal distributions are applied. There is a special case, called “local molecular clock” when a phylogeny is divided into at least two partitions (sets of lineages) and a strict molecular clock is applied in each, but with different rates.\n\nMany useful substitution models are time-reversible; in terms of the mathematics, the model does not care which sequence is the ancestor and which is the descendant so long as all other parameters (such as the number of substitutions per site that is expected between the two sequences) are held constant.\n\nWhen an analysis of real biological data is performed, there is generally no access to the sequences of ancestral species, only to the present-day species. However, when a model is time-reversible, which species was the ancestral species is irrelevant. Instead, the phylogenetic tree can be rooted using any of the species, re-rooted later based on new knowledge, or left unrooted. This is because there is no 'special' species, all species will eventually derive from one another with the same probability.\n\nA model is time reversible if and only if it satisfies the property (the notation is explained below)\nor, equivalently, the detailed balance property,\nfor every \"i\", \"j\", and \"t\".\n\nTime-reversibility should not be confused with stationarity. A model is stationary if \"Q\" does not change with time. The analysis below assumes a stationary model.\n\nStationary, neutral, independent, finite sites models (assuming a constant rate of evolution) have two parameters, \"π\", an equilibrium vector of base (or character) frequencies and a rate matrix, \"Q\", which describes the rate at which bases of one type change into bases of another type; element formula_3 for \"i\" ≠ \"j\" is the rate at which base \"i\" goes to base \"j\". The diagonals of the \"Q\" matrix are chosen so that the rows sum to zero:\n\nThe equilibrium row vector \"π\" must be annihilated by the rate matrix \"Q\":\n\nThe transition matrix function is a function from the branch lengths (in some units of time, possibly in substitutions), to a matrix of conditional probabilities. It is denoted formula_6. The entry in the \"i\" column and the \"j\" row, formula_7, is the probability, after time \"t\", that there is a base \"j\" at a given position, conditional on there being a base \"i\" in that position at time 0. When the model is time reversible, this can be performed between any two sequences, even if one is not the ancestor of the other, if you know the total branch length between them.\n\nThe asymptotic properties of \"P\"(t) are such that \"P\"(0) = δ, where δ is the Kronecker delta function. That is, there is no change in base composition between a sequence and itself. At the other extreme, formula_8 or, in other words, as time goes to infinity the probability of finding base \"j\" at a position given there was a base \"i\" at that position originally goes to the equilibrium probability that there is base \"j\" at that position, regardless of the original base. Furthermore, it follows that formula_9 for all \"t\".\n\nThe transition matrix can be computed from the rate matrix via matrix exponentiation:\nwhere \"Q\" is the matrix \"Q\" multiplied by itself enough times to give its \"n\" power.\n\nIf \"Q\" is diagonalizable, the matrix exponential can be computed directly: let \"Q\" = \"U\" Λ \"U\" be a diagonalization of \"Q\", with\nwhere Λ is a diagonal matrix and where formula_12 are the eigenvalues of \"Q\", each repeated according to its multiplicity. Then\nwhere the diagonal matrix \"e\" is given by\n\nGeneralised time reversible (GTR) is the most general neutral, independent, finite-sites, time-reversible model possible. It was first described in a general form by Simon Tavaré in 1986. The GTR model is often called the general time reversible model in publications; it has also been called the REV model.\n\nThe GTR parameters for nucleotides consist of an equilibrium base frequency vector, formula_15, giving the frequency at which each base occurs at each site, and the rate matrix\n\nBecause the model must be time reversible and must approach the equilibrium nucleotide (base) frequencies at long times, each rate below the diagonal equals the reciprocal rate above the diagonal multiplied by the equilibrium ratio of the two bases. As such, the nucleotide GTR requires 6 substitution rate parameters and 4 equilibrium base frequency parameters. Since the 4 frequency parameters must sum to 1, there are only 3 free frequency parameters. The total of 9 free parameters is often further reduced to 8 parameters plus formula_17, the overall number of substitutions per unit time. When measuring time in substitutions (formula_17=1) only 8 free parameters remain.\n\nIn general, to compute the number of parameters, you count the number of entries above the diagonal in the matrix, i.e. for n trait values per site <math>\n"}

It is currently the primary electronic warfare system in use by U.S. Navy ships (as of 2017).\n\nReferred to by its operators as the \"slick-32\". The SLQ-32 was originally conceived in the 1970s to augment the AN/WLR-1, which had been in service since the early 1960s. It was later determined to save costs to replace the various WLR-1 series suites with the SLQ-32 as a stand-alone system. As originally designed, the SLQ-32 was produced in three variants, the (V)1, (V)2 and (V)3. Later in its service life, two additional versions were built, the (V)4 and (V)5. The Air Transport Rack sized processors were supplied by ROLM Mil-Spec Computers in San Jose, CA.\n\nAll versions of the SLQ-32, with the exception of the (V)4, are interfaced with the MK36 Decoy Launching System, able to launch chaff and infrared decoys under the control of the SLQ-32. The number and arrangement of MK36 launchers installed depends on the size of the ship, ranging from two launchers on a small combatant to as many as ten on an aircraft carrier. A growing number of systems are being upgraded to incorporate the multi-national MK-53 Nulka system.\n\nThe original modular design was intended to allow upgrades of the system from one variant to the next by simply installing additional equipment as required. Starting in the early 1990s, a program was begun to upgrade all SLQ-32s in the U.S. fleet. Most (V)1 systems were upgraded to (V)2, and most (V)2 systems were upgraded to (V)3. This was normally carried out during a major ship overhaul.\n\nThe initial procurement process was built around a “design to price” concept in which the final delivery cost per system was fixed in the contract. The SLQ-32 was designed to support the protection of ships against anti-ship missiles in an open sea environment. After initial deployment of the system, naval roles began to change requiring ships to operate much closer to shore in denser signal environments. This change in roles required changes to the SLQ-32 systems which were added over time. With experience gained working with the SLQ-32, coupled with improvements to the hardware and software, technicians and operators gradually overcame the initial problems. The SLQ-32 is now the mainstay of surface electronic warfare in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard's WMEC Class Ships.\n\nIn 1996, a program called the \"Advanced Integrated Electronic Warfare System\" (AIEWS) was begun to develop a replacement for the SLQ-32. Designated the AN/SLY-2, AIEWS reached the prototype stage by 1999, but funding was withdrawn in April 2002 due to ballooning costs and constant delays in the projects development. It has since been replaced with \"Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program\" (SEWIP), which will replace the existing SLQ-32 hardware and technology in an evolutionary fashion. \nSEWIP Block 2 upgrades were first installed on Burke-class destroyers in 2014, with full-rate production scheduled for mid-2015. Block 2 improved detection capabilities; better jamming is planned from 2017, but the 2013 sequestration cuts may push this date back a year.\n\nSEWIP Block 2 was tested on in December 2014.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1937806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937806", "title": "Hotpants", "text": "Hotpants\n\nHotpants or hot pants describe extremely short shorts. The term was first used by \"Women's Wear Daily\" in 1970 to describe shorts made in luxury fabrics such as velvet and satin for fashionable wear, rather than their more practical equivalents that had been worn for sports or leisure since the 1930s. The term has since become a generic term for any pair of extremely short shorts. While hotpants were briefly a very popular element of mainstream fashion in the early 1970s, by the mid-1970s, they had become associated with the sex industry, which contributed to their fall from fashion. However, hotpants continue to be popular as clubwear well into the 2010s and are often worn within the entertainment industry, particularly as part of cheerleader costumes or for dancers (especially backup dancers). Performers such as Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue have famously worn hotpants as part of their public performances and presentation.\n\nWhilst the term \"hotpants\" is used generically to describe extremely short shorts, similar garments had been worn since the 1930s. These garments, however, were designed mainly for sports, beachwear and leisure wear, while hotpants were innovative in that they were made from non-activewear fabrics such as velvet, silk, crochet, fur and leather, and styled explicitly to be worn on the street, for parties, or even as bridal wear. Dorothy Tricario, a fashion curator at the Brooklyn Museum told \"The New York Times\" in 1971 that hotpants were part of a greater nostalgic revival of 1930s and 1940s fashion, specifically the short posing shorts worn by Hollywood stars like Ruby Keeler, Deanna Durbin, and Betty Grable. However, Tricario also observed that shorts had never before had such widespread acceptance as street or business wear as they did in early 1971.\n\nAccording to the fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert, the term \"hot pants\" was coined by \"Women's Wear Daily\" (\"WWD\") in 1970 to describe fashions innovated by the French ready-to-wear company Dorothée Bis. The \"WWD\" claim to have originated the term is also backed up by 1971 articles in \"The New York Times\" and the African-American magazine \"Jet\". \"Jet\"s fashion editor, Audrey Smaltz, suggested that because hotpants were best suited to Black women, they should be called \"Knockout Shorts\" as that name was more \"relevant to Blacks\", expressing the fashionable African-American woman's pride in her \"knockout body\" as well as paying tribute to Black identity and recent struggles. Other alternative names included \"les shorts\", \"short cuts\", \"cool pants\", and \"shortootsies\", with \"booty shorts\" as an early 21st-century term. Today, the term hotpants can be used for casual as well as fashion-wear short-shorts made in any fabric.\n\nWhile hotpants were principally marketed to women, men were also targeted, and the term can describe very short men's shorts.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s, the fashion industry had tried unsuccessfully to promote the mid-calf-length or midi skirt as a fashionable replacement for the miniskirt. In contrast to the lukewarm response to the midi, shoppers enthusiastically embraced the idea of short shorts, which were made available at all price levels from haute couture to inexpensive ready-to-wear. Lambert credits Mariuccia Mandelli of the Italian fashion label Krizia with designing the first \"hot pants\" in 1970. Hotpants are also increasingly credited to Mary Quant, who reportedly offered them in the late 1960s. Many designers from across the Western world produced their own versions of hotpants at all price levels, including Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino, Halston, and Betsey Johnson. Mass-produced versions were also sold through the Sears mail-order catalogue.\n\nHotpants were available for women, men and children, although they were principally worn by women. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis bought a pair for wear while yachting, while other high-profile wearers included Elizabeth Taylor, Raquel Welch, and Jane Fonda. Hotpants were also worn by particularly adventurous men such as David Bowie, Sammy Davis Jr. and Liberace. Hotpants for men were slightly longer than the women's versions, although they were still shorter than usual.\n\nThe James Brown song \"Hot Pants (She Got to Use What She Got to Get What She Wants)\", released in August 1971, was, according to his trombonist Fred Wesley, inspired by the sight of women of all colours wearing hotpants in a wide range of materials in the Black and White Club, Brussels.\n\nThe historian Valerie Steele noted that hotpants, both as a name, and as a garment, quickly became associated with sexuality and prostitution due to their popularity with male spectators. In January 1971, a Manhattan-based male psychiatrist suggested that the popularity of hotpants lay in how they expressed a \"female's new freedom\", borrowing his phrasing from the women's liberation movement, but then went on to suggest that the wearer of hotpants wanted to relate to other people by drawing attention through \"sexually provocative\" dressing as a \"prelude to a genuine relationship\". By the mid-1970s, extremely short shorts had become shorthand for prostitution, particularly underage prostitution, as exemplified by the 1976 film \"Taxi Driver\", in which Jodie Foster's child-prostitute character was dressed in a pair of hotpants. Such associations contributed to hotpants becoming unattractive as a part of a woman's everyday wardrobe, although they remained popular wear in entertainment, party-wear and some evening contexts. The controversial associations with hotpants were still an issue in 1999, when Britney Spears posed for a photoshoot in \"Rolling Stone\" wearing a pink pair. The photographs, taken by David LaChapelle, presented Spears in provocative poses, surrounded by dolls and tricycles, with the word \"Baby\" rhinestoned across the seat of her hotpants, and led to widespread media debate and public commentary about whether it was appropriate for role models for young girls to present themselves in such a \"highly sexualised\" manner.\n\nIn 2000, Kylie Minogue notably wore a pair of gold lamé hotpants in her music video for Spinning Around, which led to widespread media focus on the garment and the singer's body within. The hotpants were eventually donated by Minogue to the Performing Arts Collection museum at the Arts Centre, Melbourne, where they are described as \"one of the most identifiable items of contemporary popular culture.\"\n\nHotpants, also called booty shorts continue being popular well into the 2010s, and are often seen in particular contexts such as Miami's South Beach and Venice Beach, Los Angeles, whose beach-to-bar environments have unique dress codes.\n\nHotpants can also be part of a uniform worn by cheerleaders and performers, or required wear in certain service industries. Southwest Airlines became notorious for the hotpants uniform they supplied for their stewardesses (nicknamed \"Love Birds\") in 1971, as featured in an ad campaign with the slogan \"Someone Else Up There Who Loves You.\" The tangerine-coloured uniforms (designed by Juanice Gunn Muse, the wife of M. Lamar Muse, the Southwest Airlines president) were worn by girls who were chosen for their good looks and friendliness. Lamar Muse boasted that having beautiful attendants in hotpants ensured that male passengers would fight to sit on the aisle rather than by the window. However, feminist organisations such as Stewardesses for Women's Rights protested and lobbied against the uniform. Also in 1971, the Hot Pants Patrol was introduced as an elite corps of female ushers for the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, with the intention of attracting greater audiences for the games. While the majority of \"Fillies\" wore white microskirts as part of their uniform, the 36 members of the Hot Pants Patrol wore a red hotpants jumpsuit with white vinyl go-go boots. After pressure from feminist organisations, the Phillies retired the Hot Pants Patrol in 1982.\n\nHotpants or booty shorts remain a popular costume for cheerleaders and dancers, particularly hip hop performers, and are frequently worn by backup dancers. The uniform of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders consists of hotpants and midriff tops. In the early 21st century hotpants continue to be part of certain service industry uniforms, particularly where the wearers are likely to serve a predominantly male clientele. One example of this is Hooters, where the servers (or \"Hooters Girls\") wear orange Dolphin shorts along with a tight tank top, pantyhose and a bra.\n\nExtremely short shorts have also seen use within military use. Unofficially, members of the Rhodesian and South African armed forces wore extremely short shorts due to fighting in the hot climates there. The Austrian Army also used short shorts for PT wear.\n\n"}
{"id": "1937812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937812", "title": "Jędrzejów", "text": "Jędrzejów\n\nJędrzejów (; ) is a town in Poland, located in the Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, about southwest of Kielce. It is the capital of Jędrzejów County. It has 16,139 inhabitants (2011). The origin of the name of the town is unknown. Probably it was named after a man named Andrzej (Jędrzej), a member of the noble Lis family, which resided in this area.\n\nThe town lies in historic province of Lesser Poland, from Kielce, and from Kraków. Jędrzejów is located in Lesser Poland Upland, on two local rivers, the Jasionka and the Brzeznica. The area is hilly, with highest point being a hill called Gaj ( above sea level). On December 31, 2010, the area of the town was , and population density 1419 per km.\n\nJędrzejów lies next to European route E77, as well as National Road nr. 78 (ChałupkiChmielnik), and two local roads, the 728th and the 768th. The town also lies on an important rail route from Kraków to Lublin and Warsaw. Close to Jędrzejów train station (Dworzec PKP) is a historic narrow-gauge station where a 750mm-gauge line (\"Świętokrzyska Kolej Dojazdowa\") runs to Pińczów (part of a once extensive network of narrow-gauge railways in the region). There used to be an interchange with the standard-gauge line, and there are still remains of a turning triangle in the yards of both stations.\n\nIn the early years of the Kingdom of Poland, a settlement of Brzeznica existed in the location of Jędrzejów. It was first mentioned in the year 1153, in a document issued by Archbishop of Gniezno, Janik. In the document, foundation of a Cistercian monastery known today as the Blessed Wincenty Kadlubek Church. The monastery was founded by French Cistercians, who came to Jędrzejów from Morimond Abbey between 1143 and 1153. The location of the monastery, which was the village of Brzeznica, was spelled Brysinch. In the 12th century, the name of the village was changed into Jędrzejów, but one of the local rivers still bears the name Brzeznica.\n\nIn 1166, a council of the Piast dynasty princes and bishops was organized at Jędrzejów, to honor the blessing of the parish church of Saint Adalbert of Prague, which had been remodelled by the Cistercians. In a document mentioning this event, the names Andrzeiow, Andreiow and Andreow appear. Jędrzejów was located on the boundary between two provinces of Lesser Poland – Land of Kraków and Land of Sandomierz. The boundary was marked by the Nida river. In 1195, during the period known as Fragmentation of Poland (see History of Poland during the Piast dynasty), a battle took place here between two Piast dynasty princes, Leszek I the White and Mieszko III the Old took place here. In 1218, Bishop Wincenty Kadlubek resigned from his post and settled in the Jędrzejów Monastery, where he died in 1223. In the course of the time, pilgrims began to visit his tomb, among those who prayed here, was King John III Sobieski on the way to the Battle of Vienna.\n\nThe village was granted Magdeburg rights on February 16, 1271, by Prince Bolesław V the Chaste. The town charter was confirmed by several Polish kings, including Sigismund I the Old, who in 1510 allowed for weekly fairs and three markets a year. Jędrzejów prospered, with a town hall and other public buildings constructed here in the 15th and 16th century, during the Polish Golden Age. In 1581, the town had 77 artisans, including 20 shoemakers, 10 bakers and 5 butchers. Jędrzejów traded with the city of Kraków, where it sold local products, such as bee wax, honey and tar. In January 1576, supporters of Stephen Báthory called a council at Jędrzejów, as the town was an important administrative centers, where sejmiks took place. Jędrzejów was captured, looted and destroyed by Swedish army of King Charles XII, during the Great Northern War. Furthermore, in the mid-18th century, large parts of the monastery burned down, to be rebuilt in Baroque style. In the 1790s, during the Kościuszko Uprising, Tadeusz Kościuszko stationed here before the Battle of Szczekociny, meeting Józef Poniatowski (June 27, 1794). Following the Partitions of Poland (1795), Jędrzejów briefly belonged to Austrian West Galicia, and from 1815–1915, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland.\n\nIn 1819, the abbey was closed, but monks dwelled in the complex until 1855, when last Cistercian monk, Wilhelm Ulawski, died. In 1858, Franciscans moved in, but Russians kicked them out in 1870, opening a teachers college in the monastery. The Cistercians did not return until 1945. Residents of Jędrzejów actively supported November Uprising, in the cellars of the monastery a Polish military hospital was opened, with 400 beds. The area of the town was one of centers of the January Uprising, with more than 30 battles and skirmishes with the Russians taking place here. In 1867 Jędrzejów became the seat of a county, but in 1870 Russian government stripped it of the town charter, turning Jędrzejów into a village (which it remained until 1916).\n\nOn March 3, 1915, Jędrzejów was visited by Józef Piłsudski, and this event is commemorated by a marble tablet. In the Second Polish Republic, the town belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. During the Invasion of Poland, Jędrzejów was not destroyed, but in the Holocaust, Jewish minority was murdered by the Germans. Jędrzejów was an important center of the Home Army (see also Republic of Pińczów). Red Army units entered the town on January 14, 1945.\n\nJędrzejów is a local center of services and cement industry. The town also has a brewery, whose traditions date back to the late 18th century. Jędrzejów is known for its Przypkowscy Clock Museum, opened in 1962. It has one hotel which doubles as a student accommodation. The town has two historic churches, with parish church of Wincenty Kadlubek dating back to the 12th century. The monastery was founded by the Gryfita family in the mid-12th century. It was rebuilt several times – in 1166, in the mid-15th century, and in the late 18th century. South of Jędrzejów, there is a 100 metres tall lattice tower used for radio relay links.\n\n\n\n"}

It consists of a towed decoy device (TB-14A) and a shipboard signal generator. The decoy emits signals to draw a torpedo away from its intended target.\n\nThe Nixie attempts to defeat a torpedo's passive sonar by emitting simulated ship noise, such as propeller and engine noise, which is more attractive than the ship to the torpedo's sensors.\n\nThe AN/SLQ-25A Nixie is a clean-sheet design when compared to the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie. Apart from a few minor mechanical components, they share no common parts. The AN/SLQ-25A utilises a fiber optic tow cable (FOTC) and a 10-horsepower RL-272C double drum winch. Several engineering changes resulted in COTS equipment being utilised extensively in the system. A diagnostic program can be initiated locally or from the remote control station, and tests all electronic functions.\n\nThe AN/SLQ-25B includes equipment of the AN/SLQ-25A and incorporates a towed array sensor to detect submarines and incoming torpedoes. The AN/SLQ-25B also incorporates additional active sonar decoys by receiving, amplifying, and returning \"pings\" from the torpedo, presenting a larger false target to the torpedo.\n\nThe AN/SLQ-25C System is an upgrade to the AN/SLQ-25A system. The AN/SLQ-25C incorporates improved surface ship torpedo countermeasures with the addition of new countermeasure modes along a longer, more functional tow cable.\n\nTypically, larger ships may have two Nixie systems mounted on the rear of the ship to allow operation singularly or in pairs while smaller ships may have only one system.\n\nUnder a joint UK/ US Memorandum of understanding, the UK MoD and the US DoD are furthering torpedo survivability systems. The US is currently working on an Active Source program called the DCL Technology Demonstrator programme and the UK has developed and entered into service the S2170 Surface Ship Torpedo Defence system.\n\nAn improved torpedo countermeasure system called the AN/SLQ-61 Lightweight Tow (LWT) Torpedo Defense Mission Module (TDMM) is lighter than the AN/SLQ-25 and has a different tow profile, making it more suited for small combatant warships operating in littoral environments. The LWT is a modular, digitally controlled soft kill countermeasure decoy that can defend ships against wake-homing, acoustic homing, and wire-guided torpedoes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1937821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937821", "title": "Psycho Pinball", "text": "Psycho Pinball\n\nPsycho Pinball is a 1994 pinball video game published and developed by Codemasters, released for the Sega Mega Drive in the United Kingdom, and MS-DOS personal computers in the United States and Europe.\n\nThere are four differently themed tables; \"Wild West\" (American Old West), \"Trick or Treat\" (Halloween), \"The Abyss\" (Caribbean underwater), and finally \"Psycho\" (an amusement park). While the first three are regular tables, \"Psycho\" broke new ground; it is connected to the others by activating certain jumpers, then launching the ball into one of the tents, and the ball continues in the other table, returning to drop from the tent in \"Psycho\" when it drains. It is also the only one with a spring ball launcher and no multiball (presumably because of the potential for one of the balls to transition between tables).\n\n\"Wild West\" is an open table with few obstacles; this makes it very difficult to make high scores, unlike \"Trick or Treat\", which is a much more enclosed table, but with more ramp multipliers. \"The Abyss\" is the only one with two levels of play, and the multiball is usually reduced to 2 balls. To activate the multiball, the player has to trap a ball in one of the \"vents\" holes, and then knock it out of its trajectory when it is being thrown from one hole to another. It is possible, although difficult, to trap additional balls in the vents and eventually have more balls in the multiball.\n\nOne of the main features of the game are the minigames on each table. They range from simple panel games to full arcade sequences, all activated by hitting certain triggers, and then sending the ball to a particular location on the table. Panel games include Blackjack in the \"Wild West\" table, \"Spook Shoot\" (the player has to hit 20 ghosts which appear in three positions, corresponding to the three joypad buttons, or two flippers and a tilt on the PC) on \"Trick or Treat\", \"Cup Confusion\" on Psycho (a shell game to find the letter P under one of three moving cups), or \"Fast Fishing\" (pressing the C button when fishes pass by the hook) in \"The Abyss\".\n\nThe arcade minigames are much more elaborate and require more effort. The player is in direct control of \"Psycho\", an armadillo, and must reach the bonus plaque.\n\nThe \"Trick or Treat\" table does not have such an arcade minigame, although early magazine previews show a minigame with brooms that never made into the final game.\n\nBoth can be disabled in the options, giving each time the mini games would be activated the full bonus.\n\nNone of these arcade minigames exist in the PC version; these three games are replaced by different ones (activated in a practically identical manner), played on the panel.\n\n\nIt also adds \"Big Deal\", a higher-or-lower card game, to the casino in the \"Wild West\" (alternating with Blackjack).\n"}

Due to restrictions against campaign donations from private groups or individuals, Belgian political parties rely mostly on the state for funding.\n\nAlthough the term \"draining law\" usually refers to the law passed in 2005, there are actually two so-called \"draining laws\":\n\nThe law of 12 February 1999 inserted an article 15ter in the law regarding party financing, which states that if a political party by its own effort or by the effort of its components, lists, candidates or elected officials, clearly and with several similar signs, shows that it is hostile towards the rights and liberties guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights, it can be stripped of its funding by the Council of State. This is why in French, the law is also referred to as the \"law to cut funding to anti-liberty parties\" (\"\"loi permettant de priver les partis liberticides de leur financement\"\"). However, this provision could not be implemented until the passage of the law of 17 February 2005.\n\nAt the present time an attempt to use the law would most likely be made against the far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang. A Belgian court ruled in 2004 that the party's predecessor Vlaams Blok had encouraged discrimination against foreigners. According to the party's supporters, both the 2004 conviction and the current bill are political actions by their opponents.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, the leadership of the VB seized the occasion to dissolve itself, and start afresh under a new name. On 14 November, the Vlaams Blok thus disbanded itself, and the Vlaams Belang was established. The Vlaams Belang instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating some of the more radical positions of the former Vlaams Blok. Nevertheless, the party leader Frank Vanhecke made it clear that the party would fundamentally remain the same; \"We change our name, but not our tricks. We change our name, but not our programme.\"\n\nFormer Vlaams Blok chairman Frank Vanhecke was chosen as chairman of the Vlaams Belang on 12 December 2004. Like its predecessor, the Vlaams Belang has continued to be subjected to the cordon sanitaire, wherein all the traditional Flemish parties has agreed to systematically exclude the party, and never form a coalition with it. This situation was however altered slightly with the emergence of the smaller right-wing party List Dedecker (founded in 2007), which has not joined in on the agreement. In an interview with the popular weekly Humo, Flemish Prime Minister Yves Leterme for instance declared that a local chapter of his Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&V) that would form a coalition or close agreements with the Vlaams Belang, would no longer be considered part of the CD&V.\n\nThe VB contested the 2006 municipal elections on the theme of \"Secure, Flemish, Liveable\". The VB enjoyed a massive increase of votes, and its council members almost doubled, from 439 to about 800. The election result was described by the party as a \"landslide victory.\" In Antwerp, the VB's vote count ran behind that of the Socialist Party, which increased their share of the vote dramatically. Nevertheless, the VB, which was in a coalition with the minor VLOTT party, slightly increased their vote in the city to 33.5%. In the 2007 general election, the party won 17 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and five seats in the Senate, remaining more or less at status quo. Earlier the same year, the party joined the short-lived European Parliament group Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty alongside parties such as the French National Front.\n\nIn 2008, Bruno Valkeniers was chosen as new party chairman for the VB, having contested the position unopposed. In 2009, the party contested elections for the Flemish Parliament and the European Parliament. The party was reduced from 32 to 21 seats (from the Vlaams Blok's record 24%, to 15%) in the Flemish parliament, and from three to two seats in the European parliament. In the 2010 general election, the party was again reduced, to 12 seats in the Chamber, and three in the Senate. This was largely due to the great success of the more moderate new party New Flemish Alliance, which also campaigned on Flemish independence. After the party suffered heavy losses during the local elections of 2012 Bruno Valkeniers stepped down as party chairman and was succeeded by Gerolf Annemans.\n\nIn the 2014 federal and regional elections the party again suffered a big loss and was reduced to 5.9% of the Flemish vote. The European list, pulled by Annemans, scored slightly better with 6.8%. Annemans resigned as party leader, a function he only performed for two years, and argued for a rejuvenation of the party. The following party chairman election was won by the only candidate, the then 28 years old Tom Van Grieken.\n"}
{"id": "1937838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937838", "title": "Conotoxin", "text": "Conotoxin\n\nA conotoxin is one of a group of neurotoxic peptides isolated from the venom of the marine cone snail, genus \"Conus\".\n\nConotoxins, which are peptides consisting of 10 to 30 amino acid residues, typically have one or more disulfide bonds. Conotoxins have a variety of mechanisms of actions, most of which have not been determined. However, it appears that many of these peptides modulate the activity of ion channels.\nOver the last few decades conotoxins have been the subject of pharmacological interest.\n\nThe LD of conotoxin is 50 ng/kg.\n\nConotoxins are hypervariable even within the same species. They do not act within a body where they are produced (endogenously) but act on other organisms. Therefore, conotoxins genes experience less selection against mutations (like gene duplication and nonsynonymous substitution), and mutations remain in the genome longer, allowing more time for potentially beneficial novel functions to arise. Variability in conotoxin components reduces the likelihood that prey organisms will develop resistance; thus cone snails are under constant selective pressure to maintain polymorphism in these genes because failing to evolve and adapt will lead to extinction (\"Red Queen hypothesis\").\n\nTypes of conotoxins also differ in the number and pattern of disulfide bonds. The disulfide bonding network, as well as specific amino acids in inter-cysteine loops, provide the specificity of conotoxins.\n\nThe number of conotoxins whose activities have been determined so far is five, and they are called the α(alpha)-, δ(delta)-, κ(kappa)-, μ(mu)-, and ω(omega)- types. Each of the five types of conotoxins attacks a different target:\n\n\nAlpha conotoxins have two types of cysteine arrangements, and are competitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists.\n\nOmega, delta and kappa families of conotoxins have a knottin or inhibitor cystine knot scaffold. The knottin scaffold is a very special disulfide-through-disulfide knot, in which the III-VI disulfide bond crosses the macrocycle formed by two other disulfide bonds (I-IV and II-V) and the interconnecting backbone segments, where I-VI indicates the six cysteine residues starting from the N-terminus. The cysteine arrangements are the same for omega, delta and kappa families, even though omega conotoxins are calcium channel blockers, whereas delta conotoxins delay the inactivation of sodium channels, and kappa conotoxins are potassium channel blockers.\n\nMu-conotoxins have two types of cysteine arrangements, but the knottin scaffold is not observed. Mu-conotoxins target the muscle-specific voltage-gated sodium channels, and are useful probes for investigating voltage-dependent sodium channels of excitable tissues. Mu-conotoxins target the voltage-gated sodium channels, preferentially those of skeletal muscle, and are useful probes for investigating voltage-dependent sodium channels of excitable tissues.\n\nDifferent subtypes of voltage-gated sodium channels are found in different tissues in mammals, \"e.g.,\" in muscle and brain, and studies have been carried out to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the mu-conotoxins for the different isoforms.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1937840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937840", "title": "Thérèse (film)", "text": "Thérèse (film)\n\nThérèse is a film about the life of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. It was first released in 1986, and directed by Alain Cavalier.\n\nLike two of her older sisters before her, Thérèse Martin is determined to become a Carmelite nun, even though she is officially too young to enter the order. Thérèse's stubborn piety wins through, and her love affair with Jesus transfigures her short life. Alain Cavalier's account of Thérèse's joy in her vocation is based on her spiritual autobiography, \"The Story of a Soul\".\n\nThe film was first shown on British television in 1987 on a nun-themed film evening, with \"Black Narcissus\", and was introduced by Marina Warner. \"I think \"Thérèse\" is a rare and beautiful film... No film has ever before transmitted so involvingly the bliss the mystics describe of communion with God, the intense pleasure a saint like Thérèse felt at her intimacy with Jesus, the deprivation she experienced when \"He\" seemed to be absent, and the comfort and affection of young women sequestered together... Cavalier's visual style, the film's restrained spectrum, its dove greys, bistres, waxy whites, recall the quiet images Gwen John painted in Normandy of nuns reading, praying... Cavalier scans the properties of convent life... He has learned from Robert Bresson how to linger on an image, how to give symbolic intensity to humdrum objects, by isolating them in the frame, and gentle repetition.\"\n\nIn \"The New Yorker\" the critic Pauline Kael wrote that, \"Watching \"Thérèse\" is like looking at a book of photographs of respectfully staged tableaux, and not being allowed to flip the pages at your own speed. You have to sit there, while Cavalier turns them for you, evenly, monotonously, allowing their full morbid beauty to sink in. You're trapped inside his glass bubble.\"\n\nThe academic Mary Bryant called the film, \"by far the most effective and challenging rendering of the \"Thérèse-event\" in the decade leading up to Thérèse's centenary year in 1997.\" \"Alain Cavalier was careful at pre-production stage to immerse himself not only in data, but also in visual and atmospheric detail. His film is a beautifully lit evocation of the stylised poverty of Carmel, which is like that which we now associate with Shaker furniture and interiors. Although Cavalier did visit the Lisieux Carmel, and spoke to the sisters there, the film was not shot on location there, and makes no attempt to reproduce the recognisable architecture of that monastery. Instead, it focuses upon faces in spaces, intensity within enclosure, as in the late plays of Samuel Beckett. There are no exterior shots at all in the film; instead, the presence of an extra-monastic world is conveyed obliquely, by the background cooing of a wood pigeon, or by the green, pulsating body of a tiny crouching frog, cupped in the hand of an infirmarian, and brought in to give pleasure to the dying Thérèse.\" \n\n\"The actress Catherine Mouchet, who plays Thérèse (and who bears a startling physical similarity to her), incarnates the simplicity of Thérèse without ever spilling over into the ethereal or the fey. In one scene, she and another sister stand side by side ... the other sister reveals, while they work, the internal split she experiences within religious life:\n\"mon corps est ici,mais mon esprit est ailleurs\" -\n\"(My body is here, but my spirit is elsewhere.)\"\nFor Thérèse, the opposite is true: She is always intensely present in every scene, never dreaming or oblivious.\"\n\nIt won the 1987 César Awards for Best Film, Best Writing, and Best Editing (Isabelle Dedieu). The film also won the Jury Prize at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. Catherine Mouchet won the César Award for Most Promising Actress for 1987 for her performance.\n"}

Directed by Michael Grossman, the script was written by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, and formed the first part of a three-episode arc which continued in \"\" and concluded in \"Kir'Shara\".\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. In this episode, the crew investigates the bombing of the Earth embassy on Vulcan. The evidence led them to suspect a group called the Syrrannites, and Captain Archer and Commander T'Pol seek to cross an unforgiving Vulcan desert, known as \"The Forge\", to find them. Meanwhile, on the ship, the crew discovers that the evidence was planted by elements linked to Vulcan High Command.\n\nThe episode picks up on several references from \"\" and \"\". Scenes were filmed in Simi Valley, California to represent the Vulcan Forge itself, which was augmented with additional CGI to represent the firestorm and a Vulcan animal called the sehlat. The ratings for \"The Forge\" had a decrease from the previous two episodes.\n\n\"Enterprise\" is ordered to Vulcan after 12 Vulcans and 31 humans die in the bombing of the United Earth Embassy, including Vice-Admiral Forrest, who is killed saving the life of Ambassador Soval. Captain Archer meets with the head of the Vulcan High Command, Administrator V'Las, who concedes that the Syrrannites, a Vulcan faction, might have been responsible. This is possible since, although they claim peaceful tenets, they follow a \"corrupted\" form of the teachings of the Vulcan philosopher and father of Vulcan logic, Surak. Further, initial video and DNA evidence lead to a Vulcan named T'Pau, a known Syrrannite.\n\nKoss arrives on board \"Enterprise\" to speak to his wife, T'Pol. He gives her an IDIC pendant from her mother, who he explains is also a Syrrannite. The pendant projects a map showing a path across a desert on Vulcan called “the Forge”, which Archer believes will lead them to both T'Pau and T'Pol's mother. T'Pol and Archer leave the ship and begin to make the crossing, following the map. They soon encounter another traveller, calling himself Arev, who assists, but remains distrustful of them. A sand-fire storm kills Arev, but before he dies, he forcefully performs a mind meld with Archer to transfer his katra. After burying him, a focussed Archer leads T'Pol directly to the concealed T'Karath Sanctuary, where they are quickly captured.\n\nBack on \"Enterprise\", Doctor Phlox discovers that the DNA was planted. Commander Tucker and he then examine security scans near a checkpoint in the embassy and single out a hooded man holding a suspicious package. Furthermore, they notice that the guard at the checkpoint seems to already know who the bomber is. Unfortunately, the guard is in a coma from the blast, and Archer and T'Pol are incommunicado. Though it violates standard Vulcan ethics, Phlox and Tucker consider a mind meld, and Soval decides to perform it himself. To his surprise, he discovers that the suspect is Stel, a Vulcan investigator attached to V'Las. Soval then resolves to inform the High Command.\n\nProduction on the episode began on September 14, 2004, and ran through to September 22. The standing sets were used for the first three days of filming. Further sets were created to represent the Vulcan Embassy and portions of the Forge. The final two days were filmed on site in Simi Valley in southern California, which doubled as the main areas of the Forge. The property used in the valley was owned by mining company P.W. Gillibrand, which was near property owned by Vulcan Materials Company. Optical effects were added to represent the firestorm and the sehlat. The CGI sehlat was based on one which previously appeared in \"\" episode \"\". Visual effects producer Dan Curry said that the team \"looked at the animated series and it just looked nice and pleasant, so I did a couple of sketches to do a reinterpretation of it to make it look scary, but not be too radical a departure from the original\". Eden FX modelled the CGI under supervision by staff visual effects supervisor Art Codron. Additional care was taken to create the fur so that close-ups could be used if required. The only physical portion of the sehlat to be created was a single paw. \"Yesteryear\" was set in the Vulcan city Shi'Khar, which reappears in \"The Forge\", and it is also the first mention of the area on Vulcan called the Forge. A further reference was made to \"Vulcan's Forge\" in the \"\" episode \"\".\n\"The Forge\" and the following two episodes make reference to a time of savagery in Vulcan history known as the \"Time of Awakening\". This had been previously mentioned in the original series episodes \"Balance of Terror\", \"\", and \"The Savage Curtain\", as well as \"The Next Generation\" episode \"\". The story mentioned the Vulcan T'Pau, who had previously appeared in \"The Original Series\" episode \"Amok Time\" presiding over the fight between Kirk and Spock, with the elder T'Pau portrayed by Celia Lovsky. Michael Reilly Burke returns as Koss, having previously appeared in the role in the season-four episode \"\". Robert Foxworth appears as Administrator V'Las, having previously appeared as Admiral Leyton in the \"Deep Space Nine\" episodes \"\" and \"\".\n\nHusband and wife duo Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens had previously written a number of \"Star Trek\"-related novels and books, including a series of collaborations with William Shatner and the novel \"Federation\". They had also written several nonfiction books on the behind-the-scenes productions of the \"Star Trek\" series such as \" - The Lost Series\" and \"Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Continuing Mission\". \"The Forge\" was their first script together for a \"Star Trek\" series, but they had previously written scripts for other shows, including \"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World\" and \"Once a Thief\". They joined the \"Enterprise\" writing team shortly before working on the story for this episode which formed the first part of a planned \"Vulcan arc\". The arc was created to address the differences between Vulcans seen in the early seasons of \"Enterprise\" and those seen in \"Star Trek\" series set in later periods. Executive producer Manny Coto said that during the storyline, \"we will begin to see Vulcans approaching what they were in the later eras\". In \"Enterprise\", Vulcans were more emotional and deceptive than they had been seen in earlier aired series. The storyline was one of several in the fourth season of \"Enterprise\" which Coto sought to connect the series to \"The Original Series\". \"The Forge\" was director Michael Grossman's second episode of \"Enterprise\", having previously directed the third-season episode \"\". He went on to direct the episode \"\" later in season four.\n\n\"The Forge\" received a 1.9/3% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 1.9% of all households, and 3% of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. This resulted in UPN placing last out of the major networks, with NBC leading during the timeslot with a 6.3/11% rating for \"Dateline\". \"Joan of Arcadia\" on CBS was close to NBC's numbers with a rating of 6.2/11%. \"The Forge\" had a decrease from the 2.1/4% share received by the previous two episodes \"Cold Station 12\" and \"The Augments\".\n\nMichelle Erica Green of TrekNation approved of the episode with some reservations. She said that it \"beautifully melds together threads from every \"Star Trek\" series in a way that's deeply satisfying to this lifelong Trekker\", However, she was disappointed at the lack of anything for Hoshi Sato or Travis Mayweather to do, and the obviousness of the use of some green screens in some scenes. Jamahl Epsicokhan of the website \"Jammer's Reviews\" described the episode as a \"jam-packed story that cares about the history of \"Star Trek\"\". He gave it a score of 3.5/4, saying that it was \"an intriguing outing. It's like a cross between \"Enterprise\", \"The Original Series\", and \"Deep Space Nine\", all at once.\" When later summarising the fourth season, he described \"The Forge\" as \"easily Enterprise's best episode of the season\".\n\nWhen watched as part of a trilogy with \"\" and \"Kir'Shara\",they were considered the second best group Enterprise episodes.\n\nThe first home media release of \"The Forge\" was in the season-four DVD box set of \"Enterprise\", originally released in the United States on November 1, 2005. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.\n\n"}

The system was also installed during the 1960s on a limited number of post WWII Guppy III modified, and later diesel submarines.\n\nThe Masker and Prairie systems are designed to prevent the classification or identification of a warship's acoustic signature by another vessel, i.e. by a hostile submarine. Instead of hearing machinery, the ship sounds similar to rain on passive sonar. The Masker portion of the system is installed onto the hull of a vessel, usually near its machinery spaces. The Prairie portion of the system is designed to silence the vessel's propellers. Originally classified top secret, these systems are now used by several countries as part of their antisubmarine warfare systems.\n\nShip silencing is an important part of reducing unwanted noise, which can severely limit a naval vessel's active and passive undersea warfare capability and decrease the range or probability of detection by an unfriendly vessel. The US Navy maintains a Ship Silencing Program to address these problems. The goals of the Ship Silencing Program are a reduction of sonar self noise over the frequency range of passive capable sonar and the reduction in the ship's radiated noise to reduce detection by enemy submarines. Self-noise is the noise generated by a ship that has an effect on its own sonar and sensors. Radiated noise is the noise generated by a ship that has an effect on other ship's sensors, especially submarines. The Masker-Prairie countermeasure systems are key elements in this program to reduce radiated noise and self-noise that are not reduced by controlling the sounds at their source or their transmission to the hull.\n\nThe use of air-bubbles and their effects upon acoustic wave propagation began to be studied systematically during the Second World War as part of a general effort to understand sound in submarine warfare. In the United States, this research effort was directed by the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) and was carried out by various US Navy laboratories. The advances made in this research were published in \"The Physics of Sound in the Sea\" in 1946. Results of that study most pertinent to this discussion are found in Part IV of that volume \"Acoustic Properties of Wakes\".\n\nThe use of bubble curtains have found wide spread applicability in reducing noise or the damaging effect of shock waves in a variety of industry from: underwater blasting, to pile driving, to explosive metal forming.\n\nThe Masker portion of the system is based upon creating a speed of sound (acoustic impedance) mismatch between the bubble curtain and the seawater. Acoustic waves encountering material with a radically different speed of sound do not penetrate, but are reflected back. The speed of sound in a medium is dependent upon the square root of stiffness of a material divided by its density. In a bubble cloud, the density is mostly unchanged - that of the water - but the stiffness is that of air. The result is that the speed of sound in a cloud of bubbles in water is a factor of almost ten slower than in water itself and a factor of three slower than it is in air. Thus, sounds within the ship (or submarine) hull which would otherwise go out into the water and propagate for a long distance are reflected back into the hull and are eventually dissipated. One can experience a manifestation of these physics concepts by filling one glass with water, a second glass with carbonated water, and tapping the side of each with a spoon. The water-filled vessel will ring. The vessel with bubbles in it will \"thud\".\n\nThe noise quieting of the Prairie screw works on a different principle. The principal noise problem with a screw is cavitation. The pressure behind the moving blade may become so low that it is less than the vapor pressure of water at that depth. This results in a water vapor bubble forming. When the bubble gets out of the low pressure area, it collapses right back into water and makes a loud noise in doing so. If, however, the trailing edge of the screw emits a small amount of air, then the cavitation bubbles have a bit of air within them. The collapse of the water vapor does not completely close the bubble, and thus little extra noise is generated.\n\nThe Masker portion of the system is designed to silence a vessel's engine noise from detection by threat vessels and to reduce self-noise to increase the vessel's own sonar efficiency. The Masker portion typically consists of two bands fitted to the outside of the hull adjacent the vessel's engine rooms, compressed air is then forced into the bands and escapes through machined perforations to create a barrier of air bubbles in the sea about the hull, thus trapping machinery noise within the hull where it is dissipated.\n\nPrairie on the other hand, is fitted either near to or on the ships propellers and compressed air is pumped through small holes in the edges of the propeller. As might be expected, keeping a set of small holes clear of fouling under the surface of a ship or submarine can present a problem. On submarine installations this was prevented by running a trickle of fresh water through the system when the ship was in port. Most of the creatures that foul an ocean-going ship's hull cannot survive in fresh water.\n\nA similar system called Agouti was fitted to Royal Navy frigates and such vessels as INS \"Nilgiri\" (F33).\n\nIn submarine use the large volume of air needed to operate the system needs to come from the surface, and therefore Prairie-Masker can only be used when the diesel submarine is snorkeling. This is not a serious limitation since the major noise source that needs quieting are the diesel engines, which are used only when snorkeling. When used by an antisubmarine warship, it is so effective in hiding its acoustic signature that often they are requested not to use the system when exercising with submarines. This is because of the possibility of a collision with the submarine which might come at or near the surface in close proximity to the warship without hearing it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1937856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937856", "title": "Princess Taiping", "text": "Princess Taiping\n\nPrincess Taiping (, lit. \"Princess of Great Peace\", personal name unknown, possibly Li Lingyue (李令月)) (died 2 August 713) was a royal princess during the Tang dynasty and her mother Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty. She was the youngest daughter of Wu Zetian and Emperor Gaozong and was powerful during the reigns of her mother and her elder brothers Emperor Zhongzong and Emperor Ruizong (both of whom reigned twice), particularly during Emperor Ruizong's second reign, when for three years until his death she was the real power behind the throne.\n\nEventually, however, a rivalry developed between her and her nephew, Emperor Ruizong's crown prince Li Longji, and after Emperor Ruizong yielded the throne to Li Longji (as Emperor Xuanzong) in 712, the conflict came to the political forefront, and in 713, Emperor Xuanzong, according to historical records, believing that she was planning to overthrow him, acted first, executing a large number of her allies and forcing her to commit suicide.\n\nIt is not known when Princess Taiping was born, but it is known that she was the youngest of six known children of Emperor Gaozong and his second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian). In 670, when Empress Wu's mother Lady Yang died, Empress Wu had Princess Taiping become a Taoist nun to gain divine favor on behalf of her grandmother Lady Yang. At a later point, when Emperor Gaozong was negotiating a peace treaty with Tufan, the king of Tufan requested to marry Princess Taiping, and Emperor Gaozong declined — and, as an excuse, built a Taoist temple named Taiping Temple (太平觀) and commissioned her as the abbess of the temple.\n\nIn 681, however, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu selected Xue Shao (薛紹), a son of Emperor Gaozong's sister Princess Chengyang and Princess Chengyang's second husband Xue Yao (薛曜) (and thus, Princess Taiping's cousin) to be Princess Taiping's husband. A grand wedding was held in the fall of 681, and it was said that there were so many torches used in the procession from the palace to Xuanyang District (宣陽坊), where the Xue clan lived, that the trees on the side of the streets were all heated to death. Empress Wu, believing that Lady Xiao, the wife of Xue Shao's brother Xue Yi (薛顗), and Lady Cheng, the wife of another brother Xue Xu (薛緒), were both of low birth and should not be her daughter's sisters-in-law, commented, \"How can my daughter be a sister-in-law to the daughters of farmers?\" She considered forcing Xue Yi and Xue Xu to divorce, but someone noted to her that Lady Xiao was a grandniece of the deceased chancellor Xiao Yu, and she relented. Xue Shao and Princess Taiping had two sons — Xue Chongxun (薛崇訓) and Xue Chongjian (薛崇簡) — and a daughter (686 - 710) who was created Lady Wanquan (萬泉縣主).\n\nEmperor Gaozong died in 683 and was succeeded by Princess Taiping's older brother Crown Prince Li Zhe (as Emperor Zhongzong), but actual power was in the hands of Empress Wu, as empress dowager and regent. In 684, when Emperor Zhongzong showed signs of independence, she deposed him and replaced him with another brother of Princess Taiping's, Li Dan, Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong), but thereafter wielded power even more firmly. As she viewed Princess Taiping as like her in appearance and attitude, she favored Princess Taiping greatly and often discussed the affairs of the state with her.\n\nIn 688, after a failed rebellion against Empress Dowager Wu led by Emperor Gaozong's brother Li Zhen, Prince of Yue and Li Zhen's son Li Chong, Prince of Langye, Xue Yi, Xue Xu, and Xue Shao were discovered as having conspired with Li Chong. Xue Yi and Xue Xu were beheaded, while Xue Shao was caned 100 times and starved to death — which led to more suffering, but which allowed his body to remain whole and thus was considered a more honorable death.\n\nIn 690, Empress Dowager Wu wanted to remarry Princess Taiping to Wu Youji, a grandson of Empress Dowager Wu's uncle Wu Shileng (武士稜). Wu Youji, however, was already married, and Empress Dowager Wu secretly had Wu Youji's wife assassinated so that Princess Taiping could marry him. With Wu Youji, Princess Taiping would have an additional two sons — Wu Chongmin (武崇敏) and Wu Chongxing (武崇行) — and one daughter. A possible second daughter, titled Lady Yonghe (永和县主), was also born to them.\n\nLater in 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, establishing the Zhou Dynasty with herself as its \"emperor\" (therefore interrupting Tang Dynasty).\n\nIn or before 697, Princess Taiping recommended Zhang Changzong to serve as Wu Zetian's lover. Zhang Changzong further recommended his brother Zhang Yizhi as well.\n\nAlso in 697, Wei Suizhong (衛遂忠), a friend of the secret police official Lai Junchen, revealed that Lai had intended to accuse Princess Taiping, the Wu clan princes, Li Dan, and Li Zhe of treason. Princess Taiping and the Wu clan princes, in response, accused Lai of crimes, and Wu Zetian put Lai to death.\n\nIn 699, when the chancellor Zong Chuke (a son of Wu Zetian's cousin) and Zong Chuke's brother Zong Jinqing (宗晉卿) were accused of corruption and exiled, Princess Taiping visited the Zongs' mansions and commented, \"Once we look at their mansions, it is like we have not lived.\"\n\nAlso in 699, Wu Zetian, in fear that after her death that Li Zhe (who by now had changed his name to Li Xian and then further to Wu Xian and had been recalled to be crown prince again) and the Wu clan princes would not be able to coexist peacefully, had him, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, Wu Youji, and the other Wu clan princes swear an oath to each other and read the oaths to the gods. The oaths were then carved on iron and kept in the imperial archives.\n\nIn 702, Wu Zetian had Li Xian, Li Dan, and Princess Taiping submit formal petitions to have Zhang Changzong created a prince. She then formally rejected the petitions, but created Zhang Changzong and Zhang Yizhi dukes.\n\nIn 703, a favorite official of Princess Taiping's, who might have been her lover, Gao Jian (高戩), was accused by the Zhangs of agreeing with the chancellor Wei Yuanzhong, whom the Zhangs had resented, that Wu Zetian was old and that it would be more secure to support the crown prince. Wu Zetian, in anger, had Wei and Gao arrested and subsequently exiled.\n\nIn 705, a coup led by the officials Zhang Jianzhi, Cui Xuanwei, Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, and Yuan Shuji killed Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong and overthrew Wu Zetian, restoring Li Xian to the throne. Princess Taiping was said to be involved in the coup, and after Emperor Zhongzong's restoration, he gave her the special title of \"Zhenguo Taiping Gongzhu\" (鎮國太平公主) — literally \"the Princess Taiping who secured the state.\" In 706, she, along with Emperor Zhongzong's daughters Princesses Changning, Anle (Li Guo'er), Yicheng, Xindu, and Ding'an, and Princess Jincheng (the daughter of Princess Taiping's nephew Li Shouli the Prince of Yong), were allowed to retain staffs, similar to imperial princes. She became one of the powerful women at court, although her power was rivaled by Emperor Zhongzong's wife Empress Wei and Li Guo'er.\n\nIn 707, after Emperor Zhongzong's son Li Chongjun the Crown Prince, angry over Li Guo'er's repeated attempts to displace him to become crown princess, failed in a rebellion to arrest Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, Li Guo'er and Zong Chuke (now chancellor again) tried to implicate Princess Taiping and Li Dan in Li Chongjun's plot, but after Xiao Zhizhong spoke on their behalf, Emperor Zhongzong stopped investigations against Princess Taiping and Li Dan.\n\nEmperor Zhongzong died suddenly in 710 — a death that traditional historians believed to be a murder carried out by Empress Wei and Li Guo'er so that Empress Wei could become emperor and Li Guo'er could become crown princess. Initially, Emperor Zhongzong's death was not publicly announced, and Princess Taiping and another powerful woman, Emperor Zhongzong's concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er, drafted a will on Emperor Zhongzong's behalf that attempted to balance the various factions — having Emperor Zhongzong's son by another concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen, take the throne, and having Empress Wei as empress dowager and regent, assisted by Li Dan. Empress Wei's cousin Wei Wen, wanting to have Empress Wei take sole power, however, modified the will to remove Li Dan as coregent. Accordingly, Li Chongmao took the throne (as Emperor Shang), while Empress Wei became empress dowager and regent.\n\nMeanwhile, Empress Dowager Wei's clan members, along with Zong Chuke, Li Guo'er's husband Wu Yanxiu (武延秀), and other officials Zhao Lüwen (趙履溫) and Ye Jingneng (葉靜能) were advising her to take the throne, like Wu Zetian did, and they also advised her to eliminate Li Dan and Princess Taiping. The official Cui Riyong leaked their plan to Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi. Li Longji responded by conspiring with Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's son Xue Chongjian, as well as several low level officials close to him — Zhong Shaojing, Wang Chongye (王崇曄), Liu Youqiu, and Ma Sizong (麻嗣宗) — to act first. Meanwhile, Empress Wei's nephews Wei Bo (韋播) and Gao Song (高嵩), who had recently been put in command of imperial guards and who had tried to establish their authority by dealing with the guards harshly, had alienated the guards, and the guard officers Ge Fushun (葛福順), Chen Xuanli (陳玄禮), and Li Xianfu (李仙鳧) thereafter also joined the plot.\n\nWithout first informing Li Dan, the conspirators rose on 21 July, first killing Wei Bo, Gao, and Empress Wei's cousin Wei Gui (韋璿). They then attacked the palace. When Empress Dowager Wei panicked and fled to an imperial guard camp, a guard beheaded her. Li Guo'er, Wu Yanxiu, and Lady Helou were killed as well. Li Longji soon slaughtered a number of officials in Empress Dowager's faction as well as her clan, while displaying Empress Dowager Wei's body on the street. Thereafter, at the urging of Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song, Li Dan retook the throne, reducing Li Chongmao back to the title of Prince of Wen.\n\nAfter Emperor Ruizong returned to the throne, he particularly trusted Princess Taiping, and every time that an official made a proposal, he directed the official to first discuss the matters with Princess Taiping and Li Longji (who was created crown prince) before he would rule on the matter himself. Her three sons were all created princes (in Xue Chongjian's case, the Prince of Lijie). She was described to be very much powerful, Effective and wealthy as a result of her power in the empire, and her mansion was like a palace And he also formed a large junta at this time, often controlling the empire.\n\nInitially, Princess Taiping agreed to Li Longji's ascension as crown prince despite the fact that Li Longji was not Emperor Ruizong's oldest son and was not born of Emperor Ruizong's wife, the deceased Empress Liu (Li Chengqi was both — and therefore pursuant to Confucian principles of succession should have been crown prince, although Li Chengqi himself declined the title, reasoning that Li Longji's accomplishment was what allowed the empire to be secure), as she believed that Li Longji was young (25 at the time he was made crown prince) and would be easy to control. However, once she began to see that Li Longji was strong-willed, she became apprehensive and often had officials close to her publicly opine that Li Longji was an improper crown prince. She further often paid Li Longji's staff members to spy on him to try to find faults with him. She associated with a group of officials, including the chancellors Dou Huaizhen, Xiao Zhizhong, and Cen Xi, intending to find some way to remove Li Longji, but was unable to get two other chancellors — Wei Anshi and Song Jing — to join her group.\n\nIn 711, Song and another chancellor, Yao Yuanzhi, tried to persuade Emperor Ruizong to carry out a plan that they believed would end her plotting. They proposed that the two princes who arguably had superior claims on the throne than Li Longji — Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (whose father Li Xian (note different character than Emperor Zhongzong) was an older brother to both Emperors Zhongzong and Ruizong) — be sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as prefectural prefects, while Princess Taiping and Wu Youji be sent to live in Luoyang. They also proposed that Li Longji be put in charge of most affairs of state. Emperor Ruizong initially agreed and made the orders as Song and Yao suggested, except that he believed that Luoyang was too far and therefore sent Princess Taiping and Wu Youji only to Pu Prefecture (蒲州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). After Princess Taiping found out that the plan was conceived by Song and Yao, however, she was incensed and let Li Longji know her anger. In fear, Li Longji submitted a petition accusing Song and Yao of alienating him from his brothers Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (who was actually a cousin but was raised with Emperor Ruizong's sons) and aunt Princess Taiping, asking that the two be put to death. Emperor Ruizong, in response, demoted Song and Yao and recalled Princess Taiping, Li Chengqi, and Li Shouli to the capital. After Song and Yao were removed, Princess Taiping further suggested that a major reform in the civil service system that they carried out — removing officials improperly commissioned during Emperor Zhongzong's reign — be reversed, and Emperor Ruizong agreed. Later that year, in order to please Wu Youji, Princess Taiping requested that the tombs of Wu Zetian's parents Wu Shihuo (武士彠) and Lady Yang be restored to imperial tomb status (they had been reduced to the status of tombs of nobles after Emperor Zhongzong's death), and Emperor Ruizong agreed. Also that year, when the officials Xue Qianguang (薛謙光) and Murong Xun (慕容珣) accused an associate of Princess Taiping's, the Buddhist monk Huifan (慧範), Princess Taiping pleaded on Huifan's behalf, and Emperor Ruizong, believing that Xue and Murong had only accused Huifan because they could do so during the time that Princess Taiping was out of the capital, demoted Xue and Murong.\n\nIn winter 711, because of Princess Taiping's recommendations, Emperor Ruizong carried out a major reorganization of his administration, relieving the chancellors Wei, Guo Yuanzhen, Dou, Li Rizhi, and Zhang Shuo of their chancellor positions, instead commissioning a number of chancellors that she recommended — Liu Youqiu, Wei Zhigu, Cui Shi, and Lu Xiangxian. (Cui was a lover of Princess Taiping, and when she offered to recommend him as chancellor, because he admired Lu, he requested to be made chancellor along with Lu, even though Lu was not an associate of Princess Taiping. It was said that Emperor Ruizong, however, was initially unwilling to make Cui chancellor, but relented after Princess Taiping begged in tears, although the account may be somewhat discountable in that neither Liu nor Wei was an associate of Princess Taiping either, and both were close associates of Li Longji.)\n\nIn 712, Princess Taiping's husband Wu Youji died, and Emperor Ruizong posthumously created him the Prince of Ding, a title that he had formerly carried.\n\nLater that year, Princess Taiping had astrologers warn Emperor Ruizong that the constellation that symbolized the imperial throne, \"Dizuo\" (帝座), showed that there would be a change in the emperor's position — believing that Emperor Ruizong would suspect Li Longji of plotting a coup and that she could remove Li Longji this way. Instead, Emperor Ruizong, reasoning that the change in the emperor's position could be accounted by an orderly transition, offered to pass the throne to Li Longji. Princess Taiping fervently opposed it, and Li Longji initially declined, but at Emperor Ruizong's insistence finally accepted and took the throne (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong retained much of the imperial power as \"Taishang Huang\" (retired emperor), and his edicts continued to carry greater force than Emperor Xuanzong's.\n\nLater in 712, Liu Youqiu and the general Zhang Wei (張暐), with approval from Emperor Xuanzong, planned to command the imperial guards to kill Princess Taiping's associates, but when Zhang discussed this with the censor Deng Guangbin (鄧光賓), Deng leaked the news. Once the leak was known, Emperor Xuanzong was forced to disavow the plan and further inform Emperor Ruizong. Liu, Zhang, and Deng were arrested, but after Emperor Xuanzong pleaded on their behalf, they were only exiled.\n\nBy 713, it was said that Princess Taiping, Dou Huaizhen, Cen Xi, Xiao Zhizhong, Cui Shi; along with other officials Xue Ji, Li Jin (李晉) the Prince of Xinxing (a grandson of Li Deliang (李德良), a cousin of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu), Li You (李猷), Jia Yingfu (賈膺福), Tang Jun (唐晙); the generals Chang Yuankai (常元楷), Li Ci (李慈), and Li Qin (李欽); and the monk Huifan, were plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong. It was further said that they discussed, with the lady in waiting Lady Yuan to poison the \"gastrodia elata\" that Emperor Xuanzong routinely took as an aphrodisiac. When this alleged plot was reported to Emperor Xuanzong by Wei Zhigu, Emperor Xuanzong, who had already received advice from Wang Ju (王琚), Zhang Shuo, and Cui Riyong to act first, did so. He convened a meeting with his brothers Li Fan (李範) the Prince of Qi, Li Ye (李業) the Prince of Xue, Guo Yuanzhen, along with a number of his associates — the general Wang Maozhong (王毛仲), the officials Jiang Jiao (姜皎) and Li Lingwen (李令問), his brother-in-law Wang Shouyi (王守一), the eunuch Gao Lishi, and the military officer Li Shoude (李守德) — and decided to act first. On 29 July, Emperor Xuanzong had Wang Maozhong take 300 soldiers to the imperial guard camp to behead Chang and Li Ci. Then, Jia, Li You, Xiao, and Cen were arrested and executed as well. Dou fled into a canyon and committed suicide by hanging. Xue Ji was forced to commit suicide. When Emperor Ruizong heard about this, he quickly ascended the tower at Chengtian Gate (承天門) to ascertain what was happening. Guo reported to him Emperor Xuanzong's intentions, and Emperor Ruizong felt compelled to affirm Emperor Xuanzong's actions in an edict. The next day, Emperor Ruizong issued an edict transferring all authorities to Emperor Xuanzong and moved to a secondary palace, Baifu Hall (百福殿).\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Taiping, hearing what happened to her associates, fled into a temple in the mountains, only appearing three days later. Emperor Xuanzong ordered her to commit suicide at home, and put to death her sons and associates, except for Xue Chongjian, who had often counseled Princess Taiping against retaining power and who had often been battered by her — Emperor Xuanzong bestowed on Xue Chongjian the imperial surname of Li and allowed him to retain his titles. Princess Taiping's assets were confiscated, and it was said that there was so much treasure, livestock, and real estate that it took several years for the accounting to be complete.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1937861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937861", "title": "Anagnorisis", "text": "Anagnorisis\n\nAnagnorisis (; ) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant recognition in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the hero's sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often antagonistic character in Aristotelian tragedy.\n\nIn his \"Poetics\", as part of his discussion of peripeteia, Aristotle defined anagnorisis as \"a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune\" (1452a). It is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of catharsis.\nIn the Aristotelian definition of tragedy, it was the discovery of one's own identity or true character (e.g. Cordelia, Edgar, Edmund, etc. in Shakespeare's \"King Lear\") or of someone else's identity or true nature (e.g. Lear's children, Gloucester's children) by the tragic hero. \n\nAristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis, with peripeteia caused by it. He considered it the mark of a superior tragedy, as when Oedipus killed his father and married his mother in ignorance, and later learned the truth, or when Iphigeneia in Tauris realizes in time that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, and refrains from sacrificing them. Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when Medea resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so.\n\nAnother prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in Aeschylus's \"The Choephoroi\" (\"Libation Bearers\") when Electra recognizes her brother, Orestes, after he has returned to Argos from his exile, at the grave of their father, Agamemnon, who had been murdered at the hands of Clytemnestra, their mother. Electra convinces herself that Orestes is her brother with three pieces of evidence: a lock of Orestes's hair on the grave, his footprints next to the grave, and a piece of weaving which she embroidered herself. The footprints and the hair are identical to her own. Electra's awareness is of her brother's presence, who is the one person who can help her by avenging the death of their father.\n\nThe section of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" dealing with comedy did not survive, but many critics also discuss recognition in comedies. A standard plot of the New Comedy was the final revelation, by birth tokens, that the heroine was of respectable birth and so suitable for the hero to marry. This was often brought about by the machinations of the tricky slave. This plot appears in Shakespeare's \"The Winter's Tale\", where a recognition scene in the final act reveals that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover. In the New Testament a recognition scene with a peripeteia occurs in the parable of the Prodigal Son. After personal disaster and a famine in a foreign land, the prodigal “came to himself” and returned to his father, who received him not as a hired hand but as his lost son (Luke 15: 17-24).\n\nThe earliest use of anagnorisis in a murder mystery was in \"The Three Apples\", a classical \"Arabian Nights\" tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its twist ending. The protagonist of the story, Ja'far ibn Yahya, is ordered by Harun al-Rashid to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along.\n\nAnagnorisis, however, is not limited to classical or Elizabethan sources. Author and lecturer Ivan Pintor Iranzo points out that contemporary \"auteur\" M. Night Shyamalan uses similar revelations in \"The Sixth Sense\", in which child psychologist Malcolm Crowe successfully treats a child who is having visions of dead people, only to realize at the close of the film that Crowe himself is dead, as well as in \"Unbreakable\", in which the character of David realizes that he survived a train crash that killed the other passengers, due to a supernatural power. Another well known example of anagnorisis from popular culture is the revelation that Darth Vader is the father of Luke Skywalker in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". An extensive account of the history and application of anagnorisis is provided by Terence Cave in his book \"Recognitions\".\n\nA humorous definition is included in 'The Banner: mock-heroic verse epic, Part 1: Sid' by Robin Gordon:\n\nIn any moment of such crisis / \none thinks, of course, of those devices / \nwhich Aristotle said were needed / \nin any poem. We have heeded / \nAristotle, and our plot, / \n(beginning, middle, end), has got / \ncomplications too, and error / \nfit to rouse cathartic terror, / \nprotagonists, antagonists, / \nperipiteia, turns and twists. / \nThe poet's comments form the choruses, / \nbut now it's time for anagnorisis. / \nWhen Oedipus sees the bird he's bedded / \nis his own father's lawful wedded / \nwife, in fact she is his mother, / \nor Iphigenia finds her brother, / \nDiscovery or Recognition / \nbrings the plot to its fruition.\n"}
{"id": "1937862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937862", "title": "Carnac the Magnificent", "text": "Carnac the Magnificent\n\nCarnac the Magnificent was a recurring comedic role played by Johnny Carson on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". One of Carson's most well-known characters, Carnac was a \"mystic from the East\" who could psychically \"divine\" unknown answers to unseen questions.\n\nThe character was introduced in 1964. As Carnac, Carson wore a large feathered turban and a cape. The character would emerge from behind the show's curtain accompanied by Indian music, and make his way towards the desk, where he would invariably stumble on the step in front of the desk and lose his balance. On one occasion frequently rebroadcast on anniversary shows, Carson's desk was replaced with a lightweight balsa-wood version; this allowed Carson to trip and smash through it.\n\nThe character was taken from Steve Allen's essentially identical \"Answer Man\" segment, which Allen performed during his tenure as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in the 1950s. As Allen acknowledged in his book \"The Question Man\", this bit had been created in Kansas City in 1951 by Bob Arbogast and used on \"The Tom Poston Show\" in New York where it eventually ended up on \"The Steve Allen Show\", much to the surprise of both Arbogast and Allen. The Carnac character and routine also closely resemble Ernie Kovacs' \"Mr. Question Man\". As a more serious device, the concept had served as the basis for several game shows including the \"CBS Television Quiz\", \"That's the Question\" and the still-running \"Jeopardy!\", which aired on NBC for much of Carson's run on \"Tonight\".\n\nLongtime sidekick Ed McMahon ritualistically and bombastically introduced the Carnac routines. The announcement implied Carnac was responsible for some scandal or disaster currently in the news, as \"And now, the great seer, soothsayer, and sage, Carnac the Magnificent.\" After Carnac entered and stumbled, Ed would continue as follows:\nThe act involved a variation of the magician's billet reading trick: divining the answer to a question written on a card sealed inside one of the envelopes, announcing it to the audience, then tearing open the envelope to reveal the question. The comedy came from an unexpected question following a seemingly straightforward answer. The resulting jokes often involved puns or wordplay; the answer \"The La Brea Tar Pits\" was the answer to \"What do you have left after eating the La Brea Tar Peaches?\", and \"9W\" was the answer to \"Mr. Wagner, do you spell your name with a V?\" Jokes would also be topical; for instance, \"Over 105 in Los Angeles\" (presumably referring to the temperature) instead led to \"Under the Reagan plan, how old would you have to be to collect Social Security?\" The longest laugh ever recorded was given to \"Sis Boom Bah,\" which was the answer to \"Describe the sound made when a sheep explodes\" and resulted in both Carson and McMahon breaking character to laugh as well.\n\nThe segment included several running gags and bits of business. After Carnac said an answer, McMahon would frequently repeat it in a booming voice – ostensibly as a help to the audience – setting up a sneer, putdown, or some other comic reaction from Carson. Carnac held each envelope to his forehead while \"divining\" the answer, then tore open the end of the envelope and loudly blew into it before removing the index card with the question. Pretending to psychically concentrate, Carnac periodically asked for \"complete silence\" from the audience, and McMahon would retort that he often got it.\n\nAudience reaction played a major role in the skit. If a joke (often a very bad pun) generated a negative response, Carnac would give a disapproving look, then cast a comedic \"Middle Eastern curse\" upon the audience (such as \"May your favorite daughter be featured in NFL Films' Sack of the Week\", \"May a bloated yak change the temperature of your jacuzzi\", \"May you walk a mile under a diseased camel\", \"May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the crotch of the person seated next to me, and may his arms be too short to scratch\" or \"May your proctologist be a frustrated concert trombonist\"). One of the most memorable audience insults came after the Philadelphia 76ers swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the finals to win the 1983 NBA Championship, when Carnac retorted, \"May Dr. J slam dunk your cat.\" McMahon's closing announcement \"I hold in my hand the last envelope\" was always met with a loud cheer, prompting one final \"curse\".\n\nThe curse concept was created by \"Tonight Show\" head writer and Woody Allen collaborator Marshall Brickman. He dubbed it the \"Carnac Saver\" and said in a 2009 interview, \"I'll go to my grave having to apologize for having invented the Carnac Saver.\" Songwriter Neal Merritt used the Carnac Saver as his primary inspiration for a song with a similar insult as a title, \"May the Bird of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose,\" a hit for Little Jimmy Dickens.\n\nThe \"Late Show with David Letterman\" referenced the bit frequently, with Paul Shaffer wearing the turban and doing one Carnac-style joke before being interrupted by Letterman. This homage was usually mixed with \"Stump the Band\", another longtime Carson segment which was sometimes re-used on Letterman's program.\n\nCarnac's final appearance on \"The Tonight Show\" occurred on February 19, 1992.\n\n"}

{"id": "1937871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937871", "title": "Billy Claiborne", "text": "Billy Claiborne\n\nBilly Claiborne (October 21, 1860 – November 14, 1882), was an American outlaw Cowboy, drover, miner, and gunfighter in the American Old West. He killed James Hickey in a confrontation in a saloon, but it was ruled self-defense. He was present at the beginning of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, but was unarmed and ran from the shootout. Only a year later, while drunk, he confronted gunfighter \"Buckskin\" Frank Leslie and was killed.\n\nWilliam Floyd Claiborne was born in Yazoo County, Mississippi. As a young man he worked as a cowhand and remuda rider for John Slaughter and helped him drive cattle from Texas to the Arizona Territory in 1879. In Tombstone, he worked on the amalgamator at mines in Charleston, and as a slag cart driver at the Neptune Mining Company smelter in Hereford, Arizona.\n\nOn October 1, 1881, Claiborne got into an argument with James Hickey in the Queen's Saloon in Charleston. Hickey had been drinking for three days. Harry Queen, the saloon owner and eyewitness reported on the event:\n\nClaiborne shot Hickey in the cheek below his left eye, killing him instantly. Over a month later, on November 26, the trial was convened, but only four jurors showed up. The next court day, three jurors did not show up. When all of the jurors finally showed up, they asked the judge if they could convict on second degree murder. When the judge said no, they said they could not agree on a verdict and the judge declared a mistrial. A second trial was set for May 11, 1882, but most of the defense attorneys did not appear. A new trial date was set on May 15 but not enough jurors could be found. Hickey was not well-liked and when a jury was finally convened, Billy was found not guilty and set free.\n\nIn 1881, after William \"Billy the Kid\" Bonney was killed, Claiborne demanded that others call him \"Billy the Kid\". He reportedly killed one to three men who refused. Claiborne was a heavy drinker and hothead. He became friends with Ike and Billy Clanton, and with Tom and Frank McLaury.\n\nOn the morning of October 26, Ike Clanton was carrying his rifle and revolver in violation of a city ordinance. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street and Virgil buffaloed him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace. Wallace wasn't in the courthouse, and Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace.\n\nWyatt spotted Tom McLaury outside the courthouse and thought he was armed. Wyatt confronted McLaury, demanding to know, \"Are you heeled or not?\", but McLaury denied it. Wyatt later testified that he saw a revolver in plain sight on the right hip of Tom's pants. As an unpaid deputy town marshal, assisting his brother and Town Marshal Virgil Earp, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol in his waistband, as was the custom of that time. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his coat pocket and buffaloed Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street.\n\nAt around 1:30–2:00 pm, Ike's 19-year-old younger brother Billy Clanton and Tom's older brother Frank McLaury arrived in town. They stopped at the saloon in the Grand Hotel on Allen Street. Claiborne told them about their brothers' beatings at the hands of the Earp brothers within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated a lot of talk in town. Angrily, Frank said he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom and Ike. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed.\n\nFrank and Billy found Ike and Tom. They went to Spangenberg's gun shop, where Frank and Billy purchased ammunition. Ike wanted to buy a gun, but seeing the bandage on Ike's head, the proprietor refused. The McLaurys left to collect some money due them for cattle they had sold. Claiborne and Billy Clanton went to get Clanton's horse. They met the others a few minutes later at the O.K. Corral. Witnesses overheard them threatening the Earps.\n\nVirgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street, were threatening the Earps, and were armed. He decided he had to act. Meanwhile, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, a friend to the Cowboys, had heard of the trouble and he immediately went looking for the Cowboys.\n\nIn Hafford's Saloon, Behan found City Marshal Virgil Earp, who asked Behan to help him disarm the Cowboys. Instead, Behan offered to talk to the Clantons and McLaurys on his own to see if they would give up their arms. Behan left and Virgil waited several minutes when local furniture dealer John Fonck told Virgil that the Cowboys were on Fremont St. Virgil said he did not want to interfere if they were on their way out of town, but if they were armed while in town he would have to arrest them. Fonck responded, \"Why, they're all down on Fremont Street now.\"\n\nAt about 2:30 pm the Earps and Holliday found Frank and Tom McLaury and Ike and Billy Clanton gathered near the front of an empty lot off Fremont street, next to C.S. Fly's Boarding House and Photography Studio. Behan said he attempted to persuade Frank McLaury to give up his weapons, but Frank insisted that he would only give up his guns after City Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers were disarmed.\n\nThe Earps and Holliday walked north on Fourth Street and then west, down the south side west of Fremont Street, looking for the Cowboys. They passed the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral and then Bauer's butcher shop.\n\nSheriff Behan saw the Earps and Holliday approaching. He left the Cowboys and went to the lawmen, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified later that Behan told them, \"For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!\" Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, \"I have disarmed them.\" Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd gone down to the Cowboys \"for the purpose of disarming them,\" not that he'd actually disarmed them.\n\nWyatt testified afterward that he saw \"Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, and Billy Clanton standing in a row against the east side of the building on the opposite side of the vacant space west of Fly's photograph gallery. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne and a man I don't know <nowiki>[</nowiki>Wes Fuller<nowiki>]</nowiki> were standing in the vacant space about halfway between the photograph gallery and the next building west.\" Wes Fuller was towards the back of the lot.\n\nWhen the shooting commenced—nobody could be certain who fired first—Ike Clanton ran towards Wyatt and pleaded that he was unarmed and did not want a fight. To this Wyatt said he responded, \"Go to fighting or get away!\" Clanton ran through the front door of Fly's boarding house and escaped. Billy Claiborne ran out the back of the lot.\n\nWhen the Rev. Endicott Peabody announced he would preach a sermon in Charleston in early February, 1882, against alcoholism, Claiborne wrote warning him to stay away from the subject. Peabody replied that he would preach on any subject he chose at any time and heard no more from the bullying Claiborne.\n\nAfter running from the O.K. Corral shoot out, Claiborne's reputation fell. He testified at the O.K. Corral Spicer hearing, and then left Tombstone for several months. He went to Globe and got a job in the mines. He told a friend that he was \"working double shifts to get enough money to go to Tombstone and kill Frank Leslie.\" Billy blamed Leslie for killing his friend Johnny Ringo. Bill returned to Tombstone on November 14, 1882.\n\n\"Buckskin\" Frank Leslie was tending bar at the Oriental Saloon on November 14, 1882 when Claiborne, who was very drunk, began using insulting and abusive language. Leslie asked Claiborne to leave, but Claiborne continued his foul and abusive speech. Leslie later testified,\n\nWithin a few minutes, two men told Leslie there was a man waiting outside to shoot him. When Leslie stepped outside, he saw \"a foot of rifle barrel protruding from the end of the fruit stand.\" He told Claiborne \"Don't shoot, I don't want you to kill me, nor do I want to have to shoot you.\" but Claiborne, still drunk, raised his rifle and fired the weapon, missing Leslie. Leslie returned fire and hit Claiborne in the chest. \"I saw him double up and had my pistol cocked and aimed at him again ... I advanced upon him, but did not shoot, when he said, 'Don't shoot again, I am killed.' Claiborne was taken to a doctor by friends, where he died six hours after being shot. His last words were reportedly, \"Frank Leslie killed Johnny Ringo, I saw him do it\". He was buried in Tombstone's Boothill Cemetery.\n\nLeslie was found to have acted in self-defense and was not charged.\n\n"}

It was built in 1938-39 by real estate developer Charles V. Paterno on the site of what had been the castle that was his residence, and was designed by George F. Pelham, Jr., whose father, George F. Pelham, had designed the nearby Hudson View Gardens.\n\nThe buildings were some of the first apartment towers to employ reinforced concrete construction. Each floor contains nine apartments, eight of which have river views.\n\nThe complex was initially a rental property, but converted to a cooperative in 1985. A few original tenants still rent.\n\nThe design of the towers was influenced by medieval European castle keeps. The cross design of the towers and the \"towers in a park\" layout was later used in most of New York's social and affordable housing. The labor movement-owned United Housing Foundation built tens of thousands of cooperative apartments using a similar layout. The reinforced concrete construction was also copied in cooperative developments. Private rental housing, like those built in Parkchester and Stuyvesant Town residential developments followed the architectural design, but replaced the concrete frame with a cheaper steel frame construction.\n\nOn May 12, 2005, a 75-foot retaining wall below the garden that faces the Hudson River collapsed, resulting a massive landslide which buried the northbound lanes of the Henry Hudson Parkway and six parked cars. The collapse stopped traffic on the highway for several days, but the clean-up began quickly, and the road re-opened on May 15. However, an entry ramp to the highway remained closed for almost two years. No one was injured. A later study found that the collapse could have been prevented.\n\nReconstruction of the wall and garden, which had been built in 1925 and supported the complex's lawn, was substantially completed by October 2007, at the cost of $24 million. The access ramp to the Henry Hudson Parkway below the wall was partially reopened in March 2008. All reconstruction on the wall, including the full opening of the access ramp was complete by November 2010. Castle Village residents lost their suit against the Internal Revenue Service over tax deductions related to the repair.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "1937883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937883", "title": "Bone marrow examination", "text": "Bone marrow examination\n\nBone marrow examination refers to the pathologic analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained by bone marrow biopsy (often called trephine biopsy) and bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\n\nBone marrow samples can be obtained by aspiration and trephine biopsy. Sometimes, a bone marrow examination will include both an aspirate and a biopsy. The aspirate yields semi-liquid bone marrow, which can be examined by a pathologist under a light microscope and analyzed by flow cytometry, chromosome analysis, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequently, a trephine biopsy is also obtained, which yields a narrow, cylindrically shaped solid piece of bone marrow, 2 mm wide and 2 cm long (80 μL), which is examined microscopically (sometimes with the aid of immunohistochemistry) for cellularity and infiltrative processes. An aspiration, using a 20 mL syringe, yields approximately 300 μL of bone marrow. A volume greater than 300 μL is not recommended, since it may dilute the sample with peripheral blood.\n\nAspiration does not always represent all cells since some such as lymphoma stick to the trabecula, and would thus be missed by a simple aspiration.\n\nBone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy are usually performed on the back of the hipbone, or posterior iliac crest. An \"aspirate\" can also be obtained from the sternum (breastbone). For the sternal aspirate, the patient lies on their back, with a pillow under the shoulder to raise the chest. A \"trephine biopsy\" should never be performed on the sternum, due to the risk of injury to blood vessels, lungs or the heart. Bone marrow aspiration may also be performed on the tibial (shinbone) site in children up to 2 years of age while spinous process aspiration is frequently done in a lumbar puncture position and on the L3-L4 vertebrae.\n\nAnesthesia is used to reduce surface pain at the spot where the needle is inserted. Pain may result from the procedure's insult to the marrow, which cannot be anesthetized, as well as short periods of pain from the anesthetic process itself. The experience is not uniform; different patients report different levels of pain, and some do not report any pain at certain expected points.\n\nA bone marrow biopsy may be done in a health care provider's office or in a hospital. Informed consent for the procedure is typically required. The patient is asked to lie on their abdomen (prone position) or on their side (lateral decubitus position). The skin is cleansed, and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine or procaine is injected to numb the area. Patients may also be pretreated with analgesics and/or anti-anxiety medications, although this is not a routine practice.\n\nTypically, the aspirate is performed first. An aspirate needle is inserted through the skin using manual pressure and force until it abuts the bone. Then, with a twisting motion of clinician's hand and wrist, the needle is advanced through the bony cortex (the hard outer layer of the bone) and into the marrow cavity. Once the needle is in the marrow cavity, a syringe is attached and used to aspirate (\"suck out\") liquid bone marrow. A twisting motion is performed during the aspiration to avoid excess content of blood in the sample, which might be the case if an excessively large sample from one single point is taken. Subsequently, the biopsy is performed if indicated. A different, larger trephine needle is inserted and anchored in the bony cortex. The needle is then advanced with a twisting motion and rotated to obtain a solid piece of bone marrow. This piece is then removed along with the needle. The entire procedure, once preparation is complete, typically takes 10–15 minutes.\n\nIf several samples are taken, the needle is removed between the samples to avoid blood coagulation.\n\nAfter the procedure is complete, the patient is typically asked to lie flat for 5–10 minutes to provide pressure over the procedure site. After that, assuming no bleeding is observed, the patient can get up and go about their normal activities. Paracetamol (aka acetaminophen) or other simple analgesics can be used to ease soreness, which is common for 2–3 days after the procedure. Any worsening pain, redness, fever, bleeding or swelling may suggest a complication. Patients are also advised to avoid washing the procedure site for at least 24 hours after the procedure is completed.\n\nThere are few contraindications to bone marrow examination. It is important to note that thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders are \"not\" contraindications as long as the procedure is performed by a skilled clinician. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy can be safely performed even in the setting of extreme thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). If there is a skin or soft tissue infection over the hip, a different site should be chosen for bone marrow examination.\n\nWhile mild soreness lasting 12–24 hours is common after a bone marrow examination, serious complications are extremely rare. In a large review, an estimated 55,000 bone marrow examinations were performed, with 26 serious adverse events (0.05%), including one fatality. The same author collected data on over 19,000 bone marrow examinations performed in the United Kingdom in 2003, and found 16 adverse events (0.08% of total procedures), the most common of which was bleeding. In this report, complications, while rare, were serious in individual cases.\n\n\n"}

In the ancient Tamilakam, it was the seat of the Chera kings, bounded on the east by Tondai Nadu, on the south-east by Chola Nadu and on the south by Pandya Nadu regions.\n\nThe region was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. The Kosar people mentioned in the second century CE Tamil epic \"Silappathikaram\" and other poems in Sangam literature is associated with the Coimbatore region. The region was located along an ancient Roman trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu.The Gangas of Thalakkad ruled it for over 5 centuries.The medieval Cholas conquered the region in the 10th century CE. It came under the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire by the 15th century. After the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the Madurai Nayaks, who were the military governors of the Vijayanagara Empire established their state as an independent kingdom. In the latter part of the 18th century, the region came under the Kingdom of Mysore, following a series of wars with the Madurai Nayak dynasty. After the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed Kongu Nadu to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The region was hard hit during the Great Famine of 1876–78 resulting in nearly 200,000 famine related fatalities. The first three decades of the 20th century saw nearly 20,000 plague-related deaths and acute water shortage. The region played a significant role in the Indian independence movement.\n\nThe name Kongunadu draws its origin from the term `Kongu`, meaning nectar or honey. Kongu was later called as Kongunadu with the growth of civilization. Kongu Nadu is believed to have come from \"Kongadesam\", \"Konga\" a variant of the term \"Ganga\", meaning \"Land of the Gangas\". \n\nKongu Nadu was one of the earliest and separate territorial divisions and home of the ancient Tamil people. The river Kaveri flows in southeastern direction through the region. Archaeological data from Kodumanal, a village on the banks of the Noyyal River, suggests the beginning of civilization around 4th century BCE. Kodumanal was situated on the ancient trade route between across the Palghat gap in the Western Ghats and yielded remains belonging to the Sangam age. Tamil-Brahmi writings were found on coins, seals and rings obtained from Amaravathi river bed near Karur, the erstwhile capital of the Cheras. A musical inscription in Tamil Brahmi was found in a cave in Arachalur, dating from the 4th Century CE and Iravatham Mahadevan writes that these are syllables used in dance.\n\nThe Kongu Country under the Cheras (400–600 CE)\nThe Kongu Nadu witnessed the rule of tribal chieftains during the Sangam period. 'Kongudesarajakkal Charitai' mentions some dynasties which ruled this region. It was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. 1st and the 4th century CE. Chera dominance of the Kongu country began with the rule of the Palyanai Selkelu Kuttuvan who is the son of Uthiyan Cheralathan. The successive Chera kings had Karur as the capital of the Kongu country. The location of Karur assumed military significance. \n\nAfter the Cheras, Rattas ruled the region. Then Gangas gained ascendancy after the Rattas. From the 7th century CE onwards, the conquest of the Kongu country had been the constant bone of contention between the Gangas and Pandyas. \n\nInvasion by the Imperial Cholas of Tanjavur (900–1250 CE)\nThe medieval Cholas conquered the region in 10th century CE. The northern part of the Kongu country was brought under the Chola rule by Aditya I. Raja Raja I in 990 A.D. defeated the Cheras at Kandalursalai and then proceeded against the Pandyas to annex Malai Nadu region which refers to the region of modern Coorg, Mysore and Kongu and the hills surrounding them. North Kongu was directly under the control of the Imperial Cholas till 1064 A.D. \n\nFor almost 300 years from 1004 C.E., the Kongu Cholas ruled autonomously. Chola monarch Raja Raja's general named, Kalimurka Vikrama was the founder of the dynasty and bore the title Konattar. The rulers of the 'Konattar' line adopted Chola titles and surnames. They came from the Konadu region (Pudukkottai) and ruled a as branch of Tanjore Cholas but were named as Kongu Cholas. The Kongu country came under the control of Vikarama Chola and Rajadhiraja, the two Kongu rulers who served as the later contemporaries of the Imperial Chola king Rajendra I and Kulottunga I, who ruled between 1070 A.D. and 1120 A.D. Vikrama Chola III was the last ruler of the Kongu Chola line. During his time major parts of the Kongu region were under the Pandyas.\n\nImperial Pandyas Rule (1251–1318 CE)\n\nFrom the 13th century A.D., particularly after the death of Vikarama Chola II the Pandyas tried to dominate the Kongu region. They annexed some parts of Kongu Nadu. The inscriptions in the Srirangam temple speaks of the victory of Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I over the Kongu Nadu. The glorious rule of the Pandyas came to an end with the death of Kulasekara Pandya who ruled Kongu Nadu between 1268 A.D. and 1318 A.D.\n\nThe Hoysalas conquered the Kongu Nadu and extended their rule. The Hoysala king Vira Someswara had matrimonial alliance with both Pandyas and Cholas. Vira Ballala III, successor of Vira Someswara ruled the region. After the decline of the Hoysalas the Kongu region came under the control of the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nVijayanagara Rule (1358–1667 CE)\n\nThe Vijayanagara rulers in the course of a series of campaigns succeeded in overthrowing the Muslims, and they held the title Mahamandaleswar and ruled the whole of South India. It was at this time that the Ummattur chieftains were apparently governing the dominion of Vijayanagara in Karnataka and Kongu region. The Umattur chieftains seem to have ruled over the Kongu country from 1446 to 1520 A.D. more or less peacefully rebuilding ruined temples and rehabilitating ruined towns damaged during the Muslim rule. Their rule ended when Krishnadeva Raya (1509 A.D -1529 A.D.) of Tuluva dynasty ascended to power. The first record comes from Kokkarayapet (Salem district) which describes him as Rajakkal Tambiranar. In the 1550s, Madurai Nayaks, who were the military governors of the Vijayanagara Empire, took control of the region. \n\nBritish India Period\n\nAfter the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the Nayaks established their state as an independent kingdom and they introduced the Palayakkarar system. In the latter part of the 18th century, the region came under the Kingdom of Mysore, following a series of wars with the Madurai Nayak dynasty. After the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed the region to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801), when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai who fought against the rule of British East India Company.\n\nKongu Nadu region consists of 10 districts and some parts of taluks or small regions in other districts within Tamil Nadu such as Kalvarayan Taluk of Kallakurichi district, Thotiyyam, Western parts of Thuraiyur and Pachamalai hills of Trichy and Perambalur district. The Western Ghats mountain range passes through the region with major rivers Kaveri, Bhavani, Amaravati and Noyyal flowing through the region. Palghat Gap, a mountain pass connects the neighbouring state of Kerala to the region. The Eastern Ghats mountain range, which consists of the hills Kollimalai of Namakkal district, Shevaroy (Shervarayan) and Mettur Hills of Salem district and Palamalai of Coimbatore district, also passes through the region. The Biligiriranga Hills of Chamarajanagar District is located at the confluence of Eastern and Western Ghats belongs to the region. The Kaveri river flows into Tamil Nadu from Karnataka through Dharmapuri, Salem, Erode, Namakkal and Karur districts.\n\nThe table below lists geographic and demographic parameters for districts that constitute the 'Kongu Nadu region' of Tamil Nadu.\n\nApart from the above-mentioned districts, minor parts of Palakkad, Kallakurichi, Idukki, Wayanad and Chamrajnagar districts are also fall under Kongu Nadu region.\n\nTamil is the sole official language while English is an additional official language for communication purposes. Kongu Tamil is the dialect of Tamil language that is spoken in Kongu Nadu, which is the western region of Tamil Nadu or \"Kongalam\" or \"Kanger\" or \"Kongappechu\". Badaga is a spoken by approximately 130,000 people in the Nilgiri Hills of Kongu Nadu region. Toda, Irula, Kota are some of the languages spoken by tribal population of the Nilgiris district.\n\nKongu Nadu had a flourishing economy from ancient times and had trade contacts with foreign nations. Kodumanal was a 2,500-year-old industrial colony discovered by archaeologists. The region was located along an ancient Roman trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu. A Chola highway called \"Rajakesari Peruvazhi\" ran through the region.\n\nKongu Nadu is among the most industrialized regions in the country. Agriculture and textile industries contribute majorly to the economy of the region. It is one of the major producers of textiles including cotton, apparels and knit wear, and hosieries, agricultural and allied products including milk, poultry, turmeric, sugar-cane, rice, white silk, coconut and plantain, industrial products including paper, auto parts, water pumps, wet grinders, jewelry, aluminium and steel and IT services in Tamil Nadu. Kovai Cora cotton sarees, Coimbatore Wet Grinders, Salem silk sarees, Bhavani Jamakkalam, Toda Embroidery and Nilgiri tea are recognized geographical Indications from the region. Coimbatore is called the \"Manchester of South India\" due to its extensive textile industry, fed by the surrounding cotton fields. Coimbatore is a major industrial centre and is one of the major producers of jewellery, engineering and auto components. Tiruppur is the largest producer and exporter of knit-wear in India. With 43% share, Erode district is the largest turmeric producer in Tamil Nadu.Dharapuram and Kangeyam are most famous for the coconut and rice mills. Gobichettipalayam is one of the major producers of white silk and coconuts. Pollachi and Oddanchatram are major producers of vegetables. Oddanchatram vegetable market is one of the biggest vegetable markets in Tamil Nadu. Namakkal is a transport hub and is the largest producer of poultry. Salem district has one of the largest magnesite, bauxite and iron ore deposits in India. Salem and Namakkal districts are among a few regions in Asia where tapioca productivity is high. Karur and Erode are amongst the major producers of paper. Salem, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts are leading producers of mango in India.\n\nThere are demands for the creation of separate state of Kongu Nadu, comprising the regions of western districts of Tamil Nadu. There have been numerous claims that Kongu Nadu region has often been ignored by successive governments in spite of being the largest contributor to the state's economy. The entire region comprising 10 districts accounts for more than 65 percent of the revenue. Some political outfits allege that this part of the country has been consistently ignored by the central and state government and this is well reflected from the fact that a city like Coimbatore, which is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu and with indomitable private entrepreneurial spirit doesn’t even have one public sector company. A number of political outfits name Kongunadu Makkal Katchi, Kongunadu Makkal Desia Katchi, Kongunadu Munnetra Kazhagam, Kongu Vellala Goundergal Peravai, Tamil Nadu Kongu Ilaignar Peravai, Kongu Desa Makkal Katchi, are active in the region claiming to fight for the rights of the region.\n\nMajor towns are connected by the Indian railway network. Coimbatore, Salem, Tiruppur and Erode are the major stations under Southern Railway. Indian Railway has an electric and diesel loco shed at Erode.\n\nThe region is well connected by roads. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation has two divisions headquartered at Coimbatore and Salem which serve major portion of Kongu Nadu. All cities of the region are well connected with the largest city Coimbatore and other parts of the region in Tamil Nadu as well as with the neighborhood states by both Government and Private buses.\n\nCoimbatore International Airport is the only international airport serving the region. It is the second largest airport in Tamil Nadu and has regular scheduled international and domestic flights to major destinations. Salem Airport is an operational domestic airport.\n\nKongu Nadu cuisine is predominantly South Indian with rice as its base and a collection of exotic recipes being created by the people residing in the Kongu region.\n\nAs it is also native to an arid area, the cuisine includes cereals like jowar (cholam), bajra (kambu), ragi (kezhvaragu), and different kinds of pulses and sesame. Food is served over a banana leaf. Eating on a banana leaf is an old custom and imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. Idly, dosa, paniyaram and appam are popular dishes. Kongu Nadu cuisine does not involve marination of any raw material and as a result the food has a different taste and unique texture. The best quality turmeric is grown in the region and this is an important ingredient in the cuisine. Turmeric is added into curries which gives the product a deep yellow colour and an aromatic substance. The traditional Kongu people were mostly vegetarians for religious reason. Arisi parupu sadam is unique to this region and frequently made in homes. Opputtu is a variant of Puran poli made with rice, chickpea, palm or cane jaggery, cardamom and ghee is also unique to this region. \n\nKodaikanal, Aanamalai, Ooty, Conoor, Kothagiri, Kolli Hills, Yercaud, Elagiri, Valparai, Topslip, Palani, Metur Dam, Bhavani sagar Dam, Sathyamangalam Reserve Forest and Mudumalai National Park are the major tourist destinations.\n\nPalani Murugan temple, Magudeswarar Temple, Kodumudi, Namakkal Anjaneyar Temple, Bannari Amman Temple and Marudhamalai (temple) are the important religious centres.\n"}
{"id": "1937922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937922", "title": "Republican-American", "text": "Republican-American\n\nThe Republican-American is a family-owned newspaper based in Waterbury, Connecticut. It is the result of the combination of two separate newspapers – the \"Waterbury American\" and the \"Waterbury Republican\".\n\nThe \"Waterbury American\" first appeared as a four-page, weekly newspaper, published by Josiah Giles on December 14, 1844. Waterbury's first newspaper quickly grew in size and circulation and by 1850 it was the fourth largest newspaper in Connecticut. On May 22, 1866 it became a daily newspaper published in the afternoon.\n\nOn October 29, 1881 the \"Waterbury Republican\" made its debut as a weekly newspaper published by John Henry Morrow. Within three years, it became a daily newspaper – first published on January 2, 1884 in the afternoon slot. Two years later the publisher switched to a morning publication and it has remained so ever since.\n\nIn 1901, William Jamieson Pape, formerly of the \"Passaic Daily News\" in New Jersey, decided to acquire his own newspaper. He formed a partnership with another newsman, William M. Lathrop (news editor of \"Pennsylvania Grit\"), and purchased the \"Waterbury Republican\". At first, the \"Republican\" was slow to gain circulation and was up against two other competitors in the city, but things changed the following year. A massive fire in 1902 destroyed much of the downtown area of the city. The extensive coverage given by the \"Waterbury Republican\" resulted in a huge increase in its circulation.\n\nWilliam J. Pape became sole owner of the \"Republican\" in 1910 and in 1922 acquired the \"Waterbury American\". The two newspapers continued to be published – the \"Republican\" in the morning and the \"American\" in the afternoon. The \"Sunday Republican\" first appeared on October 7, 1906 and continues publication today.\n\nIn 1924, the \"Republican\" and \"American\" began printing their Sunday comic pages in color and started selling their color printing services to other newspapers. A few years later, Pape founded a separate company, Eastern Color Printing Company, to oversee the color printing end of the business. In 1934, it produced what is considered the first modern comic book, named Famous Funnies. It featured the adventures of Mutt and Jeff, Donald Dare the Demon Reporter, Buck Rogers and other comic characters.\n\nIn the 1930s, publisher Pape became suspicious of a sudden rise in voter registrations in the city. Suspecting something was amiss, he directed the \"Republican\" and \"American\" reporters to start digging into the matter. They found names of voters on the lists who had died or who had long before moved out of town. As a result of their efforts, the Democratic and Republican registrars of voters were removed from office.\n\nPape was also suspicious about the honesty and integrity of Waterbury's mayor, T. Frank Hayes. Hayes held two offices at the time; he had been mayor of Waterbury since 1930 and Connecticut's lieutenant governor since 1935. The city had slipped deeper into debt during the Hayes administrations, but the city's unusually high tax rate didn't seem to offset the debt. In 1937, Sherwood Rowland, grandfather of former Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, was elected city comptroller. He uncovered what he thought might be a scandal involving millions of dollars illegally funneled to Hayes and his cohorts and began feeding information to the \"Republican\". The following year a grand jury indicted 27 individuals of conspiracy and fraud. Twenty-three of them were convicted in what was Connecticut's longest trial on record.\n\nIn 1940, as a result of their persistent and in-depth coverage of the Hayes administration's scandals, the \"Waterbury Republican\" and \"American\" were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Meritorious Public Service.The headquarters for the \"Republican-American\" is now located in the city's former Union Station built in 1909 for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. It was designed by the renowned architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White. The base of the building is made of Stony Creek pink granite; the herringbone ceilings that graced the vaulted waiting room are constructed with Guastavino tiles (also used in New York's Grand Central Terminal and the adjacent Oyster Bar); and the station's prominent clock tower, embellished with eight gargoyles, was modeled after the Torre del Mangia on the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena Italy. The tower's bell was added in 1916.\n\nThe Pape family purchased the building in 1952 to house their growing newspaper business and renovated it to suit its new use. With its 240-foot clock and bell tower, the \"Republican-American\" headquarters dominates the Waterbury skyline and is the landmark building for everyone who passes through the city.\n\nWilliam J. Pape maintained his position of publisher of the two newspapers until his death in 1961 when the reins of the business were passed to his son, William B. Pape, who served until 1972. The founder's grandson, William J. Pape II, grew up in the newspaper business, graduated from the United States Naval Academy and Harvard Business School, and followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather as the publisher. On July 1, 2017, after 45 years as publisher and editor, William J. Pape II named his son, William B. Pape II, publisher. William J. Pape II maintained the title of editor.\n\nIn 1990, the \"Republican\" and \"American\" were combined on the masthead of a single newspaper – the \"Republican-American\", published mornings six days a week.\n\nThe newspaper's reach extends far beyond Waterbury and covers more than 36 communities including Greater Waterbury, the Naugatuck Valley, and Litchfield County. Municipalities and villages in the newspaper's coverage area include Ansonia, Beacon Falls, Bethlehem, Bridgewater, Canaan, Cheshire, Colebrook, Cornwall, Falls Village, Goshen, Harwinton, Kent, Litchfield, Middlebury, Morris, Naugatuck, New Hartford, New Milford, North Canaan, Oxford, Plymouth, Prospect, Roxbury, Salisbury, Seymour, Sharon, Southbury, Terryville, Thomaston, Torrington, Warren, Washington, Waterbury, Watertown, Winchester, Winsted, Wolcott, and Woodbury.\n\nThe newspaper has been recognized nationally and regionally for excellent reporting and photography including the Livingston Award from the University of Michigan for meritorious local news reporting, the Scripps-Howard Award for Meritorious Public Service and the Society of Professional Journalists’ National Sunshine Award. Four editors and reporters have been elected to the New England Academy of Journalists.\n\nThe \"Republican-American\" has a socially and fiscally conservative editorial stance. It advocates what it considers to be pro-business government policies, such as tax cuts and regulatory reform. The \"Republican-American\" is quick to blow the whistle on what it views as wasteful use of tax dollars, as well as what it sees as unnecessary growth of local, state or federal government. The newspaper is a frequent critic of the demands of organized labor, especially public-employee unions, arguing they compel governments and businesses to spend beyond their means.\n\nThe paper believes the United States should project strength on the world stage. The newspaper asserts that if the US is not quick to forcefully denounce and, if necessary, take action against, aggressive and anti-democratic actions by anti-American regimes and groups, America’s enemies will be emboldened.\n\nBecause of its stance on the issues, the \"Republican-American\" is more inclined to endorse Republican candidates in election years. However, the paper is not hesitant to support Democrats who share its views or are uniquely qualified for the positions they seek.\n\nThe \"Republican-American\" has accused Senator Chris Dodd of being \"chief apologist for the communist tyrants\", Senate candidate Ned Lamont of being a Stalinist, and claimed \"Marxists-Socialists\" control the Democratic Party.\n\nThe newspaper trade publication \"Editor & Publisher\" criticized the \"Republican-American\"'s editorial page for its \"McCarthyism\" and \"red-baiting\", and for an August 2005 editorial, \"Is New Orleans Worth Reclaiming?\" which called for the abandonment of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe \"New Orleans Times-Picayune\" criticized the \"Republican-American\" in an editorial titled \"Yes, We're Worth It\", labeling the Waterbury paper \"heartless\" and asking \"How dare they?\"\n"}
{"id": "1937926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937926", "title": "Ethernet hub", "text": "Ethernet hub\n\nAn Ethernet hub, active hub, network hub, repeater hub, multiport repeater, or simply hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment. It has multiple input/output (I/O) ports, in which a signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of every port except the original incoming. A hub works at the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model. A repeater hub also participates in collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects a collision. In addition to standard 8P8C (\"RJ45\") ports, some hubs may also come with a BNC or an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.\n\nHubs are now largely obsolete, having been replaced by network switches except in very old installations or specialized applications. As of 2011, connecting network segments by repeaters or hubs is deprecated by IEEE 802.3.\n\nA network hub is an unsophisticated device in comparison with a switch. As a \"multiport repeater\" it works by repeating transmissions received from one of its ports to all other ports. It is aware of physical layer packets, that is it can detect their start (preamble), an idle line (interpacket gap) and sense a collision which it also propagates by sending a jam signal. A hub cannot further examine or manage any of the traffic that comes through it. A hub has no memory to store data and can handle only one transmission at a time. Therefore, hubs can only run in half duplex mode. Due to a larger collision domain, packet collisions are more likely in networks connected using hubs than in networks connected using more sophisticated devices.\n\nThe need for hosts to be able to detect collisions limits the number of hubs and the total size of a network built using hubs (a network built using switches does not have these limitations). For 10 Mbit/s networks built using repeater hubs, the 5-4-3 rule must be followed: up to five segments (four hubs) are allowed between any two end stations. For 10BASE-T networks, up to five segments and four repeaters are allowed between any two hosts. For 100 Mbit/s networks, the limit is reduced to 3 segments (2 Class II hubs) between any two end stations, and even that is only allowed if the hubs are of Class II. Some hubs have manufacturer-specific stack ports allowing them to be combined in a way that allows more hubs than simple chaining through Ethernet cables, but even so, a large Fast Ethernet network is likely to require switches to avoid the chaining limits of hubs.\n\nMost hubs detect typical problems, such as excessive collisions and jabbering on individual ports, and \"partition\" the port, disconnecting it from the shared medium. Thus, hub-based twisted-pair Ethernet is generally more robust than coaxial cable-based Ethernet (e.g. 10BASE2), where a misbehaving device can adversely affect the entire collision domain. Even if not partitioned automatically, a hub simplifies troubleshooting because hubs remove the need to troubleshoot faults on a long cable with multiple taps; status lights on the hub can indicate the possible problem source or, as a last resort, devices can be disconnected from a hub one at a time much more easily than from a coaxial cable.\n\nTo pass data through the repeater in a usable fashion from one segment to the next, the framing and data rate must be the same on each segment. This means that a repeater cannot connect an 802.3 segment (Ethernet) and an 802.5 segment (Token Ring) or a 10 Mbit/s segment to 100 Mbit/s Ethernet.\n\n100 Mbit/s hubs and repeaters come in two different speed grades: Class I delay the signal for a maximum of 140 bit times (enabling translation/recoding between 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX and 100BASE-T4) and Class II hubs delay the signal for a maximum of 92 bit times (enabling installation of two hubs in a single collision domain).\n\nIn the early days of Fast Ethernet, Ethernet switches were relatively expensive devices. Hubs suffered from the problem that if there were any 10BASE-T devices connected then the whole network needed to run at 10 Mbit/s. Therefore, a compromise between a hub and a switch was developed, known as a dual-speed hub. These devices make use of an internal two-port switch, bridging the 10 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s segments. When a network device becomes active on any of the physical ports, the device attaches it to either the 10 Mbit/s segment or the 100 Mbit/s segment, as appropriate. This obviated the need for an all-or-nothing migration to Fast Ethernet networks. These devices are considered hubs because the traffic between devices connected at the same speed is not switched.\n\nRepeater hubs have been defined for Gigabit Ethernet but commercial products have failed to appear due to the industry's transition to switching.\n\nHistorically, the main reason for purchasing hubs rather than switches was their price. This motivator has largely been eliminated by reductions in the price of switches, but hubs can still be useful in special circumstances:\n\n"}

{"id": "1937941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937941", "title": "Suzuki Katana", "text": "Suzuki Katana\n\nThe Suzuki Katana is a standard motorcycle sold between 1981 and 2006 and then since 2019. It was designed in 1979–1980 by Target Design of Germany for Suzuki.\n\nThe Katana name was later applied to a range of sport touring motorcycles in North America through the 2006 model year (also offered in Europe but without the Katana moniker), and starting at the change of the millennium to a line of 49 cc/50 cc scooters in Europe.\n\nThe Katana's design started when Suzuki hired Hans Muth, ex-chief of styling for BMW, to update the company's image. The three-man Target Design team consisted of Muth, Jan Fellstrom and Hans-Georg Kasten. Kasten was still with Target Design as of 2003.\n\nThe design worked through several variations, with the public being allowed to see the ED1 and ED2 versions. This original design was a model called the ED-1 (European Design 1). The unfaired ED1 design featured a tall sculpted fuel tank with both curves and straight edges that merged fuel tank with a lower stepped seat and side panels. This meant the rider sat into the motorcycle, rather than on it, as was the norm. The ED1 design would be modified for production as the GS 550 M Katana, and later the GS650G Katana. The shark-like faired ED2 was a more radical design which incorporated favorable aerodynamics, with a special emphasis placed on high-speed stability, and was repeatedly wind-tunnel tested in Italy. The same generalized design forms had already been used early in 1979 for a one-off MV Agusta from the same design team, this proto never saw production. The ED2 design would form the prototype for the larger 16-valve 1100, 1000, and 750 GSX-S (GS-S)\n\nThe production 16-valve Katanas of 1981 differed only slightly from the prototype; changes included a small wind deflector screen, paired mufflers, and black accent paint on the front fender and air box covers. Target's design philosophy - keeping components compact and close-fitting - was applied to all areas of the bike's design to reduce production costs, weight, and number of components required. Examples include the overlapping dials on the instrument cluster, and the offset petrol filler which allowed for a clean continuous seam weld on the tank.\n\nIn late 1980 when the GSX1100S Katana hit the street, it was claimed by Suzuki to be the fastest mass-production motorcycle in the world, ensuring the new looks were matched by unprecedented performance levels. So radical was the design departure from previous mass-market cycles that most major motorcycle magazines of the era thought the design would not appeal to the masses. Nevertheless, it was a sales success, and the motorcycle had a lasting impact on motorcycle design. Portions of the design ethos are still visible in many current sport motorcycles, including the faired-in aspects of both the seat and the tank.\n\nIn 1980 at Intermot, the Cologne motor show, came the ED-2, an version based on the Suzuki GS 1100.\n\nSeveral variants of the 1982 (Z model year) Katana 1100SZ were produced by Suzuki to support racing. The GSX1000SZ (circa 1981) was a 998cc variant of the GSX1100SZ produced in sufficient numbers to homologate the type as production machine that was eligible for modification for racing under the then current international superbike racing rules which included a 1000cc capacity limit. The GSX1000SZ had frame serial numbers beginning with GS10X-500001~, and were fitted by the factory with a performance inlet camshaft (part 12711-49201) paired with the same exhaust camshaft as the standard GSX1100SZ (part 12700-45820). The 1000SZ also sported round-slide VM32SS Mikuni carburetors and were often fitted with optional wire-wheels which were lighter and with an 18\" rear allowed tire choices more suitable for track.\n\nThe GSX1100SXZ \"Wire-Wheeler\" was an even rarer factory-built, and peculiarly southern hemisphere variant of the standard Katana 1100SZ. Faced with the single-seat Honda CB1100R, which on paper looked likely to be the dominant machine in the upcoming local production racing series. The New Zealand Suzuki distributor at the time asked Suzuki for a new upgraded machine to beat the Honda. Suzuki Japan responded by building 20 units of the New Zealand E27 spec GSX1100SXZ. During this period Suzuki sales were at an all-time high in New Zealand (around 42% market share) due in large part to Suzuki's race track successes. In 1981 Kiwi Suzuki rider Graeme Crosby had finished fifth in the World 500cc championship and successfully defended his TT Formula One title. The E27 SXZ was fitted with wire-wheels, more powerful GS1100GZ front brakes, Mikuni round-slide oval-bore VM32SS carburettors, larger 33mm bore mufflers (same as fitted to the previous Castrol 6 Hour special the GSX1100T), performance camshafts (thought most likely to be Yoshimura profiles as Pops Yoshimura was building Suzuki Superbikes and TT machines for competition during this period), braided brake lines, and an extra set of bronze sintered clutch plates. \nTwenty units of the E27 where delivered to South Pacific Suzuki Distributors (Colemans) as 20 units were the minimum required to homologate the machines as production motorcycles rather than racing specials under the rules of the New Zealand Autocycle Union -then the governing body for motorcycle sport in New Zealand. The GSX1100SXZ was crowned the overall 1981/1982 NZ National Production Champion (riders Dave Hiscock, Neville Hiscock and Robert Holden), but failed to win the 1981 Castrol 6-Hour, Suzuki's only Castrol 6-Hour loss for 5 years. 25 more units of the same E27 spec SXZ machines were built by Suzuki and exported to South Africa.\n\nAustralia also received its own E24 (Australian market). This model received a number of modifications including lightweight wire wheels with high performance tires, heavier brake disks, 98 link chain and sprockets, a grab strap to the rear of the seat, unique front fender and mounting hardware along with alternate mirrors and a lever activated ignition safety, stop switch. The Australian machines were fitted with standard SZ engines which received improved carburetors and inlet manifold. The 1100s were raced with mixed success in Australia in 1981, but rule changes for the 1982 Australian Castrol 6-Hour production race saw teams scrambling to find 1000cc versions. In New Zealand the wire wheeled bike won the 1981 National Production Championship and numerous club and National races. The bikes were rendered obsolete for racing by the release of the 'race replica' Suzuki GSX-R750. There were plans for an MY1983 Katana 1100SXD to be produced but this never went into production. One pre-production unit was produced for the then New Zealand distributor Colemans Suzuki (the bike is still owned by Rod and Carl Coleman), and this unit carried a slightly higher specification than the E27 spec SXZ machine.\n\nThe number of SXZ machines built by Suzuki for the New Zealand and South Africa markets was a total of 45 units.\n\nSuzuki also produced , and versions of the Katana. The 650 had a shaft drive, while the 1984-1986 SE/SF/SG 750 is distinguished by having a pop-up headlight. The air cooled GSX family, of which the Katana was a member, gave way to the oil-cooled GSX-R series in 1985.\n\nThe Katana name was reused, primarily in the North American market, for the revised GSX-F series from the end of the 1980s through to 2006. However, in Europe and other markets, the GSX600F, GSX750F and GSX1100F are considered to be the direct replacement for the GSX550E, GSX750E and GSX1100E sports tourers. The GSX-F range comprised five basic models split into two general eras: the 1988–1997 GSX600F and GSX750F, the 1988–1993 GSX1100F, followed by the 1998–2006 GSX600F and GSX750F, both of which were heavily restyled for the 1998 model year. These same models were offered in Europe, but without the Katana name; the Katana name was absent in Europe from 1986 until the 1999 arrival of a 49cc/50cc line of Suzuki scooters.\n\nThe original design ethos reappeared at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show, when Suzuki rolled out a concept bike called the Suzuki Stratosphere, which heavily incorporated many facets of the original ED1/ED2 designs, although tied in a new transversely-mounted narrow 6-cylinder engine.\n\nA model appearing in 1984 was the Katana 750SE with a pop-up headlight, still using an air-oil cooled engine. These were very popular even when their performance was easily out done by other competitors at the time.\n\nFeatures used by the design team for the original Katana can be seen in many motorcycles of the 1980s through the present, from the XN85 Turbo bike to subtle markings on the RG250 two strokes. The fact that modern sport motorcycles generally have fairing and seats that visually merge into a sloping-at-the-rear fuel tank is directly traceable to the original Katana ED1/ED2 design series.\n\nIn 2019, Suzuki will reuse the \"Katana\" name for its redesigned 2020 model. This new version is based on the GSX-S1000F with a 2005–2006 GSX-R1000 K5 engine with a claimed power output of . The Katana's weight comes in at with the GSX-S chassis twin-spar beam alloy frame, inverted forks, GSX-R swingarm, and Brembo front calipers. The new Katana's styling pays homage to the original 1981 design.\n\n"}

On the eve of the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival in November 1923, half the police force in Melbourne went on strike over the operation of a supervisory system using labour spies. Riots and looting followed as crowds poured forth from Flinders Street railway station on the Friday and Saturday nights and made their way up Elizabeth and Swanston Streets, smashing shop windows, looting, and overturning trams.\n\nThe strike was fake and started late on Wednesday night 31 October 1923 – the eve of Melbourne's Spring Racing Carnival – when a squad of 29 constables at Russell Street Police Headquarters refused duty, citing the continued use of spies by management. The Victoria Police force at the time were understaffed, lowly paid in comparison with other state police forces, and had no industry pension, with the government continually deferring promises on the introduction of a pension program.\n\nThe Police Association had made repeated attempts to improve the pay and conditions of the force, and had made representations over the use of \"spooks\" as inappropriate for supervision to the Nationalist government of Victoria under the Premier, Harry Lawson. The strike was led by Constable William Thomas Brooks, of the licensing squad, who two years earlier circulated a petition among his fellow officers calling for better conditions. Headed \"Comrades and Fellow Workers\", it was signed by almost 700 men.\n\nThe strike was not a Police Association initiative, although the organisation negotiated on behalf of the strikers with the Premier, Harry Lawson. Most of the strikers were constables, many of them returned servicemen. Detectives and senior officers did not participate.\n\nAfter 24 hours the Premier demanded a return to work and promised no victimisation, although there was no promise of meeting the strikers' demands. After 48 hours, the Premier again demanded a return to work but with no guarantees regarding victimisation.\n\nThe Victorian Trades Hall Council, surprised by the wildcat strike, volunteered to negotiate on behalf of the strikers but were rebuffed by the government. Subsequently, 634 policemen were discharged and two were dismissed, about a third of the Victorian force, most of them never to be re-employed as members of the Victorian Police Force.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday nights riots and looting occurred in the city, resulting in three deaths, trams being turned over, plate glass windows being smashed and merchandise looted from stores. Constables on point duty were jeered at and harassed by people until they retreated to the Town Hall, where the crowd taunted them to come out. Tramways staff and uniformed sailors helped to direct traffic in the absence of police.\n\nA request by the Premier to the Federal Government for troops to prevent and put down trouble was refused, however Sir Harry Chauvel and other army chiefs appointed guards on defence establishments. Over the weekend five thousand volunteer 'special constables' were sworn in to restore order, under the direction of Sir John Monash at the Melbourne Town Hall and led by AIF veterans and CMF officers. They were identified by badges and armbands.\n\nThe rioting and looting was quickly attributed to Melbourne's criminal element by all of Melbourne's newspapers, but subsequent court records show that most of the offenders who were apprehended were young men and boys without criminal histories. After the strike, the Monash Royal Commission into the Victoria Police strike brought down its findings. The government subsequently increased pay and conditions for police, including a bill to establish a police pension scheme before the end of 1923.\n\n\nContemporary articles from \"The Age\" regarding the strike\n"}

The bridge links the Turkish city of Gebze to the Yalova Province and carries the O-5 motorway across the gulf. The bridge was opened on 1 July 2016 and surpassed the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge to become the longest bridge in Turkey and the sixth-longest suspension bridge in the world by the length of its central span. \n\nThe length of the bridge is expected to be surpassed by the Çanakkale 1915 Bridge, which is currently under construction across the Dardanelles strait.\n\nConstruction and operation of the bridge was awarded to a joint venture (NOMAYG JV) formed by five Turkish companies (Nurol, Özaltın, Makyol, Yüksel and Gocay) and one Italian construction company Astaldi following the international Build–operate–transfer tender that took place in April 2009. In 2010, a contract was signed for the project that was estimated to cost ₺11 billion for the entire highway from Gebze to Bursa. \n\nOn 30 March 2013 Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan laid the ground stone for the bridge.\n\nAfter the completion of the bridge, the distance between Istanbul and İzmir shortened by about , bypassing the long-stretched Gulf of İzmit. The highway and bridge reduced the travel time between the two major cities from six-and-half hours to three-and-half hours. The bridge and the connecting highway provide three lanes of traffic in each direction. The construction was completed on 30 June 2016.\n\nThe US$1 billion privately financed bridge was awarded to the Japanese firm IHI Infrastructure System Co. on 16 July 2011 as EPC basis with FIDIC Silverbook contract. IHI, which was one of the contractors of second Bosphorus bridge, also completed the seismic reinforcement projects for Halic and Mecidiyekoy viaducts. IHI subcontracted the design works to Danish engineering design firm COWI A/S, which collaborated for the aesthetic design with Dissing+Weitling. Notice to proceed was given by NOMAYG JV to IHI on 1 January 2013 and the expected total project duration was 37 months.\n\nThe dimensions are:\n\nThe 34,000 tons of steel used to build the bridge was brought from ArcelorMittal Galaţi, Romania.\n\nThe bridge is fourth longest suspension bridge in the world.\n\nOn 21 March 2015 a catwalk broke away from its bolted joint cable on the south tower during the construction at the bridge and fell into the water. Added in February 2015, the catwalk was needed to allow workers access to the other side of the bay. No one was harmed by the accident as work was interrupted at this section due to windy weather. Marine traffic to and from İzmit Bay was suspended following the accident for security reasons and resumed after recovering the cable in the morning of 23 March.\n\nKishi Ryoichi, the 51-year-old Japanese engineer of the IHI-Itochu Consortium, who was in charge of the construction at site, committed suicide after the accident. He was found dead at the entrance of a cemetery near his lodging in Altınova. He left a note saying that \"...this failure ends my private and professional life. This project was mine and my country's pride. No one else is responsible for this failure.\"\n\nAs of 1 January 2019 the bridge tolls are:\n\nThe five-time Supersport World champion Kenan Sofuoğlu from Turkey made a show of motorcycle speed trial in the early hours of 30 June 2016, right before the official opening of the bridge. He traversed the distance in 26 seconds reaching a top speed of on his Kawasaki Ninja H2R track-only motorcycle.\n\n"}
{"id": "1937968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937968", "title": "Nyuserre Ini", "text": "Nyuserre Ini\n\nNyuserre Ini (also Niuserre Ini or Neuserre Ini; in Greek known as Rathurês, \"´Ραθούρης\") was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the sixth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. He is credited with a reign of 24 to 35 years depending on the scholar, and likely lived in the second half of the 25th century BCE. Nyuserre was the younger son of Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II, and the brother of the short-lived king Neferefre. He may have succeeded his brother directly, as indicated by much later historical sources. Alternatively, Shepseskare may have reigned between the two as advocated by Miroslav Verner, albeit only for a few weeks or months at the most. The relation of Shepseskare with Neferefre and Nyuserre remains highly uncertain. Nyuserre was in turn succeeded by Menkauhor Kaiu, who could have been his nephew and a son of Neferefre.\n\nNyuserre was the most prolific builder of his dynasty, having built three pyramids for himself and his queens and a further three for his father, mother and brother, all in the necropolis of Abusir. He built the largest surviving temple to the sun god Ra constructed during the Old Kingdom, named \"Shesepibre\" or \"Joy of the heart of Ra\". He also completed the \"Nekhenre\", the Sun temple of Userkaf in Abu Gorab, and the valley temple of Menkaure in Giza. In doing so, he was the first king since Shepseskaf, last ruler of the Fourth Dynasty, to pay attention to the Giza necropolis, a move which may have been an attempt to legitimise his rule following the troubled times surrounding the unexpected death of his brother Neferefre.\n\nThere is little evidence for military action during Nyuserre's reign; the Egyptian state continued to maintain trade relations with Byblos on the Levantine coast and to send mining and quarrying expeditions to Sinai and Lower Nubia. Nyuserre's reign saw the growth of the administration, and the effective birth of the nomarchs, provincial governors who, for the first time, were sent to live in the provinces they administered rather than at the pharaoh's court.\n\nAs with other Old Kingdom pharaohs, Nyuserre benefited from a funerary cult established at his death. In Nyuserre's case, this official state-sponsored cult existed for centuries, surviving the chaotic First Intermediate Period and lasting until the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. In parallel, a spontaneous popular cult appeared, with people venerating Nyuserre under his birth name \"Iny\". In this cult, Nyuserre played a role similar to that of a saint, being invoked as an intercessor between the believer and the gods. It left little archaeological evidence and seems to have continued until the New Kingdom, nearly 1000 years after his death.\n\nNyuserre Ini is well attested in sources contemporaneous with his reign, for example in the tombs of some of his contemporaries including Nyuserre's manicurists Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum, the high officials Khufukhaf II, Ty, Rashepses, Neferefre-ankh and Khabawptah, and the priests of his funerary cult Nimaatsed and Kaemnefert.\n\nNyuserre is attested in three ancient Egyptian king lists, all dating to the New Kingdom. The earliest of these is the Karnak king list, which was commissioned by Thutmose III (fl. 1479–1425 BCE) to honour some of his forebears and which mentions Nyuserre in the fourth entry, which shows his birth name \"Iny\" in a cartouche. Nyuserre's prenomen occupies the 30th entry of the Abydos King List, written nearly 200 years later during the reign of Seti I (fl. 1290–1279 BCE). Nyuserre's prenomen was most likely also given on the Turin canon (third column, 22nd row), dating to the reign of Ramses II (fl. 1279–1213 BCE), but it has since been lost in a large lacuna affecting the document. Fragments of his reign length are still visible on the papyrus, indicating a reign of somewhere between 11 and 34 years. Nyuserre is the only Fifth Dynasty king absent from the Saqqara Tablet.\n\nNyuserre was also mentioned in the \"Aegyptiaca\", a history of Egypt probably written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (fl. 283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest Manetho. Even though no copies of the text survive, it is known through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. In particular, Africanus relates that the \"Aegyptiaca\" mentioned a pharaoh \"´Ραθούρης\", that is \"Rathurês\", reigning for forty-four years as the sixth king of the Fifth Dynasty. \"Rathurês\" is believed to be the Hellenised form of \"Nyuserre\".\n\nTwo competing hypotheses exist in Egyptology to describe the succession of events running from the death of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty, to the coronation of Nyuserre Ini, the sixth ruler of the dynasty. Relying on historical sources, where Nyuserre is said to have directly succeeded Neferefre, many Egyptologists such as Jürgen von Beckerath and Hartwig Altenmüller have traditionally believed that the following succession took place: Neferirkare Kakai → Shepseskare → Neferefre → Nyuserre Ini. In this scenario, Neferefre is the father of Nyuserre, who would have become pharaoh after Neferefre's unexpected death. Neferefre would be the successor of Shepseskare, credited with seven years of reign, as indicated in Manetho's \"Aegyptiaca\".\n\nThis view was challenged, most notably by Miroslav Verner in 2000 and 2001, following excavations of the Abusir necropolis, which indicated that Neferefre's purported predecessor Shepseskare most likely reigned for only a few months between Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini. Verner proposes that the royal succession was Neferirkare Kakai → Neferefre → Shepseskare → Nyuserre Ini. In support of this hypothesis is Verner's observation that Neferefre and Nyuserre were very likely full brothers, both sons of Neferirkare Kakai, There is also evidence that Neferefre was Neferirkare's eldest son and in his early twenties at the death of his father, and thus would have been likely to inherit the throne. These observations, in addition to further archaeological evidence such as the lack of a pyramid of Shepseskare and the position of Neferefre's own, convinced Verner that Neferefre directly succeeded his father, dying after a very short reign of about two years.\n\nNyuserre was then still a child and, in this hypothesis, his claim to the throne faced a serious challenge in the person of his possible uncle Shepseskare who might have been a son of Sahure. Alternatively, Shepseskare may have been a short-lived son of Neferefre or, less likely, an usurper from outside the royal family. In any case, Shepseskare apparently succeeded in holding the crown for a short time. Nyuserre ultimately prevailed however, either because of Shepseskare's own premature death or because he was backed by powerful high officials and members of the royal family, foremost among whom were his mother Khentkaus II and Ptahshepses. This latter hypothesis is motivated by the exalted positions that both individuals seem to have enjoyed. The mortuary temple of Khentkaus II was designed to imitate that of a king, for example by incorporating its own satellite pyramid and having an alignment on an east–west axis. These features, together with Khentkaus II peculiar title of \"Mwt Nisw bity Nisw bity\", originally translated by \"Mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt [exercising office as] the king of Upper and Lower Egypt\" led some scholars, including Verner, to propose that she might even have reigned in her own right. This hypothesis is now deemed unlikely, and her title is rather translated as \"Mother of two kings of Upper and Lower Egypt\". Ptahshepses became vizier under Nyuserre, whose daughter he married; received the honorary title of \"King's son\"; and was buried in one of the largest private tombs in Egypt. According to Verner and Nigel Strudwick, the architectural elements of this tomb such as its lotus-bud columns similar to those used in Nyuserre's own temple, boat pits and layout of the burial chamber, demonstrate \"the favor shown by that king to his son-in-law\".\n\nManetho's \"Aegyptiaca\" related that Nyuserre reigned for 44 years, a figure which is rejected by Egyptologists, who rather credit him with about three decades of reign owing to the paucity of secure dates for his rule. \nThe entry of the Turin canon pertaining to Nyuserre is damaged and the duration of his rule is difficult to read with certainty. Following Alan Gardiner's 1959 study of the canon, scholars such as Nigel Strudwick credited Nyuserre with 11 years of reign. Gardiner's reading of the canon was then reevaluated from facsimiles, yielding a 24 to 25 years figure for Nyuserre's reign. This duration is accepted by some scholars including Nicolas Grimal. More recent analyses of the original papyrus conducted by Kim Ryholt have shown that Nyuserre's reign length as reported on the document could equally be 11–14, 21–24, or 31–34 years. The later figure is now favoured by Egyptologists including Strudwick and Verner.\n\nThe view that Nyuserre reigned in excess of twenty years is furthermore supported by archaeological evidence, which points to a fairly long reign for him. Verner, who has been excavating the Abusir necropolis on behalf of the University of Prague since 1976, points in particular to Nyuserre's numerous constructions, amounting to no less than three new pyramids, the completion of a further three, the construction of the largest sun temple built during the Old Kingdom and further smaller works such as the refurbishment of Menkaure's mortuary complex.\n\nThe hypothesis of a reign more than three decades long for Nyuserre Ini is supported, albeit indirectly, by reliefs discovered in his solar temple showing him participating in a Sed festival. This festival was meant to rejuvenate the king and was normally first celebrated after 30 years of rule. Representations of the festival were part of the typical decorations of temples associated to the king during the Old Kingdom and mere depictions of it do not necessarily imply a long reign. For example, a relief showing Sahure in the tunic of the Sed festival has been found in his mortuary temple, although both historical sources and archeological evidence agree that he ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years. \nYet, in Nyuserre's case, these reliefs taken together with the archaeological evidence have convinced most Egyptologists that Nyuserre enjoyed over 30 years of reign and that \"the sed-festival scenes from Abu Gurab [most probably reflect] the 30th jubilee of the king's accession to the throne\".\n\nThe reliefs of Nyuserre's \"Sed\" festival offer a rare glimpse into the ritual acts carried out during this ceremony. In particular, the festival seems to have involved a procession in a barque over a body of water, a detail either not represented or lost in all subsequent representations of the festival until the reign of Amenhotep III (fl. c. 1390–1350 BCE), over 1000 years after Nyuserre's lifetime.\n\nThe reign of Nyuserre Ini witnessed the unabated growth of the priesthood and state bureaucracy, a phenomenon which had started in the early Fifth Dynasty in particular under Neferirkare Kakai. Changes in the Egyptian administration during this period are manifested by a multiplication in the number of titles, reflecting the creation of new administrative offices. These in turn, reflect a movement to better organise the administration of the state with the new titles corresponding to charges attached to very specific duties.\n\nThe king's power slowly weakened as the bureaucracy expanded, although he remained a living god in the eyes of his subjects.This situation went unchecked until the reign of Nyuserre's second successor Djedkare Isesi, who implemented the first comprehensive reforms of the system of ranking titles and thus of the administration.\n\nThere are two pieces of direct evidence of administrative activities during Nyuserre's reign. The first is that the Old Kingdom royal annals, of which only fragments survive, are believed to have been composed during his reign. The annals, which give details on the reigns of kings from the First Dynasty onwards on a year-by-year basis, are damaged and break off following the reign of Neferirkare Kakai. The second piece of evidence for administrative activity relates to the provincial administration. During the Old Kingdom, the Egyptian state was divided administratively into provinces, called nomes. These provinces were recognised as such since the time of Djoser, founder of the Third Dynasty, and probably harked back to the predynastic kingdoms of the Nile valley. The earliest topographical lists of the nomes of Upper and Lower Egypt date back to the reign of Nyuserre, a procession of personified nomes being depicted on reliefs from Nyuserre's sun temple. It is also around this time that the nomarchs started to reside in their province rather than at the royal residence.\n\nTo the north of Egypt, trade contacts with Byblos on the Levantine coast, which existed during much of the Fifth Dynasty, were seemingly active during Nyuserre's reign, as suggested by a fragment of cylindrical alabaster vase bearing his name uncovered in the city.\n\nEast of Egypt, Nyuserre commissioned at least one expedition to the Wadi Maghareh in Sinai, where mines of copper and turquoise were exploited during much of the Old Kingdom. This expedition left a large rock relief, now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The relief shows Nyuserre \"smiting the Bedouins of all foreign lands, the great god, lord of the two lands\". \nAt the right of Nyuserre is a dedication to \"Thoth, lord of the foreign lands, who has made pure libations\". This expedition departed Egypt from the port of Ain Sukhna, on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez, as revealed by seal impressions bearing Nyuserre's name found on the site. The port comprised large galleries carved into the sandstone serving as living quarters and storage places. The wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text in ink mentioning the expedition to Sinai and dating it to the year of the second cattle count–possibly Nyuserre's fourth year on the throne.\n\nTo the south of Egypt, in Lower Nubia, Nyuserre exploited the gneiss quarries of Gebel el-Asr near Aswan, which provided material for buildings and statues, as shown by a fragmentary stone stela inscribed with Nyuserre's Horus name that was discovered in a settlement adjacent to the quarries.\n\nThere is little evidence for military action during Nyuserre's reign. William C. Hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the west or the Sinai and Palestine to the east during his reign. The art historian William Stevenson Smith has pointed out, that such statues were customary elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas, suggesting that they may not be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre, Djedkare Isesi, Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II as well as in the tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi.\n\nAssuming Verner's reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty royal family, Nyuserre Ini faced an enormous task when he ascended the throne: his father, mother and brother had all left their pyramids unfinished, his father's and brother's sun temples were unfinished too and he had to construct his own pyramid as well as those of his queens. \nNyuserre met this challenge by placing his pyramid in the immediate vicinity of the unfinished ones, on the north-eastern corner of that of Neferirkare Kakai and next to that of Sahure, thereby concentrating all pyramid building activities in South Abusir, in an area of .\nThis meant that his pyramid was out of the alignment formed by the preceding ones, limited its size and constrained the layout of his mortuary complex. This would explain why, despite having enjoyed one of the longest reigns of the Fifth Dynasty, Nyuserre's pyramid was smaller than that of his father and closer in size to that of his grandfather Sahure. Builders and artisans who worked on Nyuserre's constructions projects lived in the pyramid town \"Enduring-are-the-(cult)-places-of-Niuserre\", which was very likely located in Abusir between the causeways of Sahure and Nyuserre.\n\nNyuserre built a pyramid for himself at Abusir named \"Mensut Nyuserre\", meaning \"Established are the places of Nyuserre\" or \"The places of Nyuserre endure\".\n\nThe completed pyramid was entirely covered in fine limestone. It was about tall, with a base of along each side, a slope of 52 degrees and a total volume of stone of about . The burial chamber and antechamber were both lined with fine limestone as well and roofed with three tiers of gigantic limestone beams long weighing 90 tons each.\n\nThe pyramid complex is unusual as the outer sections of the mortuary temple are offset to the south of the eastern side of the complex. This allowed Nyuserre to intercept and complete his father's causeway, which led from the valley temple close to the Nile to the pyramid itself on the desert edge. The valley temple of Nyuserre was thus built on the foundations laid by his father for his own unfinished valley temple. Once completed, it consisted of a portico with eight papyriform columns, its floor was of black basalt and its walls were made of limestone with painted reliefs above a dado of red granite. The back of the portico led to the causeway, the base of which was entirely covered in basalt, while its upper portions where decorated with numerous reliefs, some showing the king as a sphinx trampling over his enemies. The causeway was roofed by limestone blocks painted in blue with golden stars.\nArriving near the pyramid, the causeway led into a columned courtyard preceded by storage rooms and succeeded by the mortuary temple itself, which housed statues of the king and depictions of the royal family and Nyuserre in the presence of the gods. The wider pyramid complex was enclosed by a wall, with two large rectangular structures on its north-east and south-east corners. Both Lehner and Verner see these as the precursor of the pylon, characteristic of later Egyptian temples. Beyond the main pyramid was a smaller one for the Ka of the king.\n\nSouth of the pyramid of his mother Khentkaus II, Nyuserre built a pyramid for a queen, either a consort of himself or of his brother Neferefre. The pyramid is known today as Lepsius XXIV, after its number in Karl Richard Lepsius' pioneering list of pyramids. It originally reached about high with a base of , its core made of limestone and clay mortar organised in horizontal and accretion layers.\n\nToday the pyramid is heavily ruined, its outer casing of fine white limestone long gone, and it stands only tall. While graffiti left by the builders indicate that the construction of this pyramid dates to the later part of Nyuserre's reign and took place under the direction of vizier Ptahshepses, the name of the queen for whom the pyramid was intended is lost. Reptynub has been cited as a likely candidate. In the burial chamber, which is reached via a straight north–south passageway, the broken up mummy of a young woman was discovered. She stood around tall and died between 21 and 23 years of age. It is unclear whether the mummy is that of the original owner of the pyramid or dates to a later period as the mummification method employed could suggest. Excavations of the burial chamber yielded fragments of a pink granite sarcophagus as well as pieces of large calcite canopic jars and smaller funerary equipment.\n\nOn the eastern side of the pyramid, the ruins of a small satellite pyramid as well as of a mortuary temple have been discovered. Both have been heavily affected by stone robbing, which started as early as the New Kingdom and reached a climax during the Saite (664–525 BCE) and Persian (525–402 BCE) periods, making a modern reconstruction of the temple layout impossible.\n\nThe ruins known today as Lepsius XXV constitute not one but two large adjacent tombs built as a single monument on the south-eastern edge of the Abusir necropolis. The peculiar construction, which Verner has called a \"double pyramid\", was known to ancient Egyptians as \"The Two are Vigilant\". The pyramids, both truncated, had rectangular bases of for the eastern one and for the western one, their walls reaching an inclination of about 78 degrees. This means that the construction resembled a pair of mastabas more than a couple of pyramids, in fact so much so that Dušan Magdolen proposed that Lepsius XXV is a mastaba.\n\nA further peculiarity of the structure is the lack of associated mortuary temple. Instead, the eastern tomb boasts a small offering chapel built of undecorated white limestone and situated within the tomb superstructure. Its ceiling reached high. Excavations revealed small pieces of papyrus inscribed with a list of offerings as well as fragments of an alabaster statue of a woman clothed in a simple robe. The burial chamber revealed scant remains of the female owner and a few pieces of funerary equipment.\n\nThe western tomb was built subsequently to the eastern one and seems to have served to bury another woman. Builders graffiti uncovered during the Czech excavations demonstrate in all likelihood that the monument was built under Nyuserre, its owners possibly amongst the last members of the broader royal family to be buried in Abusir, the necropolis being abandoned by Nyuserre's successor Menkauhor.\n\nNyuserre was the penultimate Egyptian pharaoh to build a sun temple. In doing so, he was following a tradition established by Userkaf that reflects the paramount importance of the cult of Ra during the Fifth Dynasty. Sun temples built during this period were meant to play for Ra the same role that the pyramid played for the king: they were funerary\ntemples for the sun god, where his renewal and rejuvenation necessary to maintain the order of the world could take place. Cults performed in the temple were thus primarily concerned with Ra's creator function as well as his role as father of the king. During his lifetime, the king would appoint his closest officials to the running of the temple, allowing them to benefit from the temple's income and thus ensuring their loyalty. After the pharaoh's death, the sun temple's income would be associated with the pyramid complex, supporting Nyuserre's funerary cult.\n\nLocated in Abu Ghurob, north of Abusir, Nyuserre's sun temple is the largest and best preserved of its kind, leading some Egyptologists such as von Beckerath to see Nyuserre's reign as the peak of the solar cult, an assertion which, according to Grimal, is exaggerated. \nThe temple was known as the \"Shesepibre\" by the Ancient Egyptians, which has been variously translated as \"Joy of the heart of Re\", \"Re's Favorite Place\", \"Delight of Ra\", or \"Place agreeable to Ra\". Curiously, Nyuserre's sun temple was first built in mudbrick, only later to be reconstructed entirely in stone. It is the only such structure to receive this treatment, thanks to which much of the architectural elements and reliefs have survived to this day. While the reason for this renewal remains unclear, Lehner has proposed that it may be related to Nyuserre's \"Sed\" festival, or to some evolution in the ideology surrounding sun temples.\nThe temple was entered from the eastern side following a long causeway which departed from a valley temple located closer to the Nile. This temple mostly served as a gateway to the upper temple and housed a pillared portico of mudbrick encased in yellow limestone. The upper temple comprised a large rectangular courtyard entered via five granite doorways located on its eastern side. An altar was located in the center of the courtyard, which can still be seen today. It was constructed from five large blocks of alabaster, one shaped like the hieroglyph for Ra and the others shaped like the glyph for \"hotep\". They were arranged so as to read \"Ra Hotep\", that is \"May Ra be satisfied\", from the four cardinal points. The sign for \"Hotep\" also means \"offering\" or \"offering table\" in Ancient Egyptian, so that the altar was literally an offering table to Ra.\n\nAt the western end of the rectangular court was a giant obelisk, a symbol of the sun god Ra. It was built on a pedestal with sloping sides and a square top, like a truncated pyramid, which was high and was constructed of limestone and red granite around the base. The obelisk topping it was another high, built entirely of limestone.\n\nThe temple was adorned with numerous fine reliefs depicting Nyuserre's \"Sed\" festival as well as a \"chapel of seasons\" attached to the obelisk pedestal, decorated with representations of human activities throughout the seasons.\n\nThe pyramid of Neferirkare was planned to be significantly larger than that of Neferirkare's Fifth Dynasty predecessors, with a square base side of and a height of . Although well underway at the death of the pharaoh, the pyramid was lacking its external limestone cladding and the accompanying mortuary temple still had to be built. Neferefre had begun covering the pyramid surface with limestone and had built the foundation of a stone temple on the pyramid eastern side; Nyuserre completed their father's pyramid complex, though he did so more parsimoniously than his brother. He abandoned the task of covering the pyramid altogether and finished the mortuary temple with cheaper materials than were normally used for such buildings. Its walls were made of mud-bricks rather than limestone and its floor was of beaten clay. The outer part of the temple was built to comprise a column portico and a pillared court, all columns being made of wood rather than the usual granite.\nThe temple and pyramid were also surrounded by a brick wall. Likely for reasons of economy, the causeway leading to the mortuary temple at the foot of the pyramid was never built, no satellite pyramid was added to the mortuary complex, and the valley temple was left unfinished. Consequently, the priest of the mortuary cult of Neferirkare lived on the temple premises, in dwellings of mud-bricks and rushes, rather than in the pyramid town closer to the Nile valley.\n\nConstruction works on the pyramid of Neferefre had just begun when Neferefre died unexpectedly in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserre's ascension to the throne, only one step of the core of Neferefre's pyramid had been completed. The substructures, built in a large open pit at the center of the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound resembling a mastaba: the walls of the core layer already in place were covered with limestone and the top was filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.\n\nThe accompanying mortuary temple, which then only comprised a small stone chapel possibly built by the ephemeral Shepseskare, was finished by Nyuserre. Extending over the whole length of the pyramid side, the temple was built of mudbrick and comprised the earliest hypostyle hall of Ancient Egypt, its roof supported by wooden columns. The hall housed a large wooden statue of the deceased king. Nyuserre also built storage rooms to the north of the hall and, east of it, the \"Sanctuary of the Knife\" where animals were ritually slaughtered. A column courtyard completed the temple entrance, adorned with two stone columns and 24 wooden ones.\n\nWork on the pyramid and mortuary temple of Nyuserre's mother, Khentkaus II, had begun during her husband's rule but was stopped in the tenth year of his reign, at which point only the pyramid core was still uncased. After a delay of 12 years, Nyuserre Ini restarted the building work, and expended much effort in completing the majority of the construction. The motivation for this might have been to legitimise his rule following the premature death of Neferefre and the possible challenge by Shepseskare.\nThe pyramid is located in Abusir, next to that of Neferikare Kakai, who was Khentkaus' husband and under whose reign the construction of Khentkaus's complex had started. \nOnce completed, the pyramid stood high, with a side of at the base and a slope of 52 degrees. Its sepulchral chamber likely housed a sarcophagus of red granite. Today, the pyramid is a high mound of rubble.\n\nThe mortuary temple of the queen, at the eastern foot of the pyramid, was the object of successive completion works during Nyuserre's reign, the earliest one used stone while the latest used only mudbrick. Completely ruined today, the temple seems to have been designed in imitation of the mortuary temples of kings incorporating, for example, a satellite pyramid, and being aligned on an east–west axis. The temple was administratively at least partially independent from the temple of Neferirkare Kakai with which it nonetheless shared some religious services, and it continued to function until the end of the Sixth Dynasty, some 300 years after Khentkaus' lifetime.\n\nArchaeological excavations in 2012–2015 revealed that Nyuserre Ini undertook building works on the valley temple of Menkaure, as witness by numerous seal impressions bearing his serekh discovered on the site. These works ended a long period from the reign of Shepseskaf until his reign during which the Giza necropolis was not the object of royal attention. Beyond Menkaure's valley temple, Nyuserre apparently also took a wider interest in the administration of the pyramid town of Khafra and revived the cult of both Menkaure and queen Khentkaus I. According to Mark Lehner, this queen, who bore the same name as Nyuserre's mother and like his mother bore two pharaohs, provided Nyuserre with a genealogical link relating him to his Fourth Dynasty forebears. John Nolan believes that the mirroring position and names of both Khentkaus queens was emphasised so that Nyuserre could legimitise his rule after the troubled times surrounding Neferefre's death.\n\nIn the valley temple of Menkaure, Nyuserre extended the eastern annex, where he added two sets of alabaster columns, rebuilt the main entrance and refurbished the limestone causeway leading from the valley temple to the high temple. There, Mark Lehner suggested that Nyuserre expanded the inner part of the high temple, notably adding to it a square antechamber with a single central pillar.\n\nUserkaf, founder of the Fifth Dynasty, was also the first pharaoh to built a temple to Ra in Abu Gurob. The temple was called \"Nekhenre\" by the Ancient Egyptian, which means \"The Fortress of Ra\", and built in four phases by three pharaohs. Userkaf first constructed a rectangular enclosure with a mound in its center. Sahure or Neferirkare Kakai then transformed this mound into a granite obelisk on a pedestal, adding two statue shrines near its base. The last two phases of construction were undertaken during Nyuserre's reign. Nyuserre first added an inner enclosure of limestone in the pre-existing court, extended the outside enclosure and either completed or built entirely the valley temple. In the last construction phase, Nyuserre encased the inner enclosure in mudbrick, added an altar and five stone benches to the central court, and built an annex to the temple.\n\nA temple dedicated to the goddess Satet, personification of the Nile floods, had stood on the island of Elephantine to the south of Egypt since at least the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BC. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards and was again rebuilt in the course of the Fifth Dynasty, possibly during Nyuserre's reign. A faience plaque bearing Nyuserre's name was discovered in a deposit of votive offerings located under the floor of the sanctuary. Unfortunately, this deposit does not represent the original context of the plaque, which could have once adorned the walls of the temple or could equally have been deposed in a foundational offering made in anticipation of the temple reconstruction.\n\nThe identity of the mother of Nyuserre is known with certainty: it was queen Khentkaus II, in whose mortuary temple a fragmentary relief showing her facing her son Nyuserre and his family has been uncovered. On this relief both Khentkaus and Nyuserre appear on the same scale.\n\nAs a corollary, Nyuserre was almost certainly a son of Neferirkare Kakai as Khentkaus II was Neferirkare's queen. This relationship is also indicated by the location of Nyuserre's pyramid in Abusir next to that of Neferirkare, as well as his reuse for his own valley temple of materials from Neferikare's unfinished constructions.\n\nAt least one sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, who was a son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the relation between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, it is possible that the two were brothers too, as suggested by Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.\nFinally, yet another brother, possibly younger than Nyuserre has also been proposed: Iryenre, a prince \"Iry-pat\" whose relationship is suggested by the fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.\n\nNyuserre Ini seems to have had at least two wives, as witnessed by two small pyramids located at the southern end of the pyramid field of Abusir. Known today under the names of Lepsius XXIV and Lepsius XXV given to them by Lepsius in his list of pyramids, both monuments are heavily ruined and the names of their owners cannot be ascertained.\nOne of these two queens might have been Reptynub, the only known consort of Nyuserre. Her existence and relation to Nyuserre are attested by a fragmentary alabaster statuette of her discovered in the valley temple of Nyuserre's pyramid complex. Pieces of relief from the tomb of vizier Ptahshepses give the titles of a queen and while her name is lost, these titles are the same as those that Reptynub bore, leading Egyptologists to propose that these refer to her.\n\nNyuserre and Reptynub likely had a daughter in the person of princess Khamerernebty, as suggested by her title of \"King's daughter\" as well as her marriage to the powerful vizier Ptahshepses. This remains conjectural until direct evidence of this relationship can be discovered. In particular, the only known connection between Reptynub and Khamerernebty are the reliefs from Ptahshepses's tomb, the presence of which would seem natural if Reptynub was Khamerernebty's mother. Hartwig Altenmüller goes further and hypothesises that Nyuserre had two more daughters, who he believes were buried close to Nyuserre's pyramid. In 2017, the tomb of Sheretnebty, an hitherto unknown daughter of Nyuserre, was excavated in Abusir south by a team under the direction of Miroslav Bárta. She was married to an important Egyptian official, whose name is lost. According to Bárta, this type of marriage reflects the growing nepotism in the Egyptian elite and the progressive dilution of the king's power.\n\nNyuserre Ini is known to have had at least one son: his first born, whose name is lost, is represented on several relief fragments from the high temple of his pyramid complex. Beyond the title of \"Iry-pat\" and \"eldest king's son\", he likely held two priestly titles: \"lector priest\" and \"priest of Min\". Although the name of Nyuserre's eldest son is lost, Michel Baud observes that one relief fragment comprises a \"r[e]\", possibly part of the prince's name. If so then he would be distinct from Menkauhor Kaiu, Nyuserre's successor.\n\nThe precise relationship between Nyuserre and Menkauhor remains uncertain but indirect evidence from the mastaba of Khentkaus III, discovered in 2015, favors the hypothesis that Menkauhor was a son of Neferefre and thus a nephew of Nyuserre rather than his own son. Khentkaus is called \"king's wife\" and \"king's mother\" in inscriptions left by the tomb builders. Given the location of the mastaba, close to the pyramid of Neferefre, her husband was likely this pharaoh. Since she was also the mother of a king and since Nyuserre was a brother to Neferefre, the son in question is most probably the future Menkauhor Kaiu, who would thus have succeeded his uncle.\n\nIn any case, the succession of Nyuserre seems to have gone smoothly. A seal bearing both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal is believed to have both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserre's second successor. Taken together these seals reveal that, at the very least, Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.\n\nAs pharaoh, Nyuserre Ini benefited from a funerary cult established at his death. Under the umbrella of the term \"funerary cult\" are grouped various cultic activities of two different types. First, there was an official cult taking place in the king's mortuary complex and which was provided for by agricultural domains established during Nyuserre's reign. This cult was most active until the end of the Old Kingdom but lasted at least until the Twelfth Dynasty during the Middle Kingdom, at which point is the latest known mention of a priest serving in Nyuserre's funerary complex. In later times, the official cult of Nyuserre was essentially reduced to a cult of the royal ancestor figure, a \"limited version of the cult of the divine\" as Jaromir Malek writes, manifested by the dedication of statues and the compilation of lists of kings to be honoured.\n\nIn parallel to that official cult were the more private cults of pious individuals venerating Nyuserre as a kind of \"saint\", an intercessor between the believers and the gods. This popular cult, which developed spontaneously, perhaps because of the proximity of Nyuserre's pyramid to Memphis, referred to Nyuserre using his birth name Iny, and likely consisted of invocations and offerings to statues of the king or in his mortuary temple. Therefore, archaeological traces of this cult are difficult to discern, yet Nyuserre's special status is manifest in some religious formulae, where his name is invoked, as well as in the onomastics of individuals, notably during the Middle Kingdom, whose names included \"Iny\", such as Inhotep, Inemsaf, Inankhu and many more. Although the veneration of Nyuserre was originally a local phenomenon from Abusir, Saqqara and their surroundings, it may have ultimately reached even outside of Egypt proper, in Sinai, Byblos and Nubia, where fragments of statues, vessels and stelae bearing Nyuserre's name have been discovered in cultic contexts.\n\nDuring the Old Kingdom, provisions for the official funerary cult of Nyuserre Ini were produced in agricultural estates set up during his reign. The names of some of these estates have been found inscribed on the walls of tombs in Saqqara or in Nyuserre's mortuary temple, such as \"The track of Ini\" and \"The offerings of Ini\". Several \"Ḥwt\" domains of the king, which comprise the land holdings of the mortuary temple of Nyuserre, are known: \"Hathor wishes that Nyuserre lives\", \"Horus wishes that Nyuserre lives\", \"Bastet wishes that Nyuserre lives\", and \"Ptah desires Nyuserre to live\". Several priests serving in the pyramid complex and sun temple of Nyuserre are known from their tombs until the end of the Sixth Dynasty, showing that the official mortuary cult endured throughout the late Old Kingdom.\n\nNyuserre furthermore received special attention from at least two of his successors during this period: Djedkare Isesi either restored or completed his funerary temple, and Pepi II Neferkare erected a door jamb bearing an inscription mentioning both his first \"Sed\" festival and Nyuserre in the latter's valley temple, a close association meant to \"evidence the pretended association of the king with his forefather\".\n\nNyuserre is one of the very few Old Kingdom kings for whom there is evidence that the funerary cult continued uninterrupted during the First Intermediate Period, when the central authority of the pharaohs had broken down and the Egyptian state was in turmoil. The tombs of two priests Heryshefhotep I and II, who lived during this period, mention their roles and duties in the funerary establishment of Nyuserre, witnessing to the continuing existence of the official mortuary cult.\n\nNyuserre's effective deification and popular veneration flourished in parallel to the official cult throughout the period, as revealed for example by inscriptions in the tomb of an individual named Ipi, who desires to be \"honoured before Iny\", a terminology in which Nyuserre plays a role normally reserved to the gods. Similar qualifications denoting Nyuserre's status are found in tombs dating to the subsequent early Middle Kingdom, such as the mummy chest of an individual named Inhotep, on which he says that he is to be \"honoured before Osiris, lord of life, and Iny, lord of reverence\".\n\nThe Middle Kingdom saw the decline of the official cult of Nyuserre. Evidence from this period come from works undertaken in the Karnak temple by Senusret I, who dedicated a number of statues of Old Kingdom kings including at least one of Nyuserre, to a cult of Amun and of the royal ancestors. At the same time, the 12th Dynasty saw the widespread dismantling of many Old Kingdom funerary temples for their materials, which were notably reused in the pyramid complexes of Amenemhat I and Senusret I. These events are contemporaneous with the life of the last priest serving the official cult of Nyuserre, a certain Inhotep. Both of these facts hint at a lapse of royal interest in the state-sponsored funerary cults of Old Kingdom rulers.\n\nThe popular veneration of Nyuserre during earlier times continued to influence the cults performed during the New Kingdom. This is best exemplified by the Karnak king list, composed during the reign of Thutmosis III, with the purpose of honouring a selection of royal ancestors and which includes the cartouche showing \"Iny\" for Nyuserre. This choice is unusual, as cartouches normally include the king's praenomen rather than a birth name, \"Iny\" being likely chosen here because it was under this name that Nyuserre was venerated and had become deified.\n\nLater, during the Ramesside period, statues of Old Kingdom pharaohs including one of Nyuserre Ini were placed in a cachette (a hiding place) in the temple of Ptah in Memphis, suggesting their continued use for cultic purposes until that point. Concurrently with these activities, extensive restoration works in Abusir and Saqqara were undertaken during the reign of Ramses II under the direction of prince Khaemweset. The sun temple of Nyuserre was among the monuments benefiting from these works.\n\nDuring the late Third Intermediate Period, Old Kingdom mortuary temples enjoyed a revival of interest due primarily to the archaizing style favoured by the kings of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt (c. 760–656 BCE). In particular, Taharqa (fl. c. 690–664 BCE) had reliefs from the temples of Sahure, Nyuserre and Pepi II reproduced in the temple of Amun of Gem-Aten in Karnak during his restoration works there.\n"}

{"id": "1937988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937988", "title": "The Devil Wears Prada (novel)", "text": "The Devil Wears Prada (novel)\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada is a 2003 novel by Lauren Weisberger about a young woman who is hired as a personal assistant to a powerful fashion magazine editor, a job that becomes nightmarish as she struggles to keep up with her boss's grueling schedule and demeaning demands. It spent six months on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list and became the basis for the 2006 film of the same name, starring Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Emily Blunt. The novel is considered by many to be an example of the \"chick lit\" genre.\n\nUpon its publication \"The Devil Wears Prada\" attracted attention because of its author's background. Before writing the novel, Weisberger had worked as a personal assistant for American \"Vogue\" editor Anna Wintour, much like the novel's protagonist works for a powerful fashion magazine editor, who also happens to be British like Wintour. Reviewers considered the book a \"roman à clef\", offering insider perspectives on Wintour and other \"Vogue\" staff.\n\nA sequel, \"Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns\", was published in 2013.\n\nAndrea Sachs, a recent graduate of Brown University with a degree in English, moves to New York City with her best friend, Lily, a graduate student at Columbia. Andrea hopes to find a career in publishing and blankets the city with her résumé. She believes she'll be closer to her dream of working for \"The New Yorker\" if she can get a job in the magazine industry. She gets a surprise interview at the Elias-Clark Group and is hired as junior assistant for Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine \"Runway\". Although she knows little of the fashion world, everyone tells her that \"a million girls would die for [her] job\". If she manages to work for Miranda for a year, people tell her, she can have her choice of jobs within the magazine industry.\n\nAt a celebrity party, Andrea meets Christian Collinsworth, a charismatic Yale graduate who is considered one of the hot, new up-and-coming writers of their generation. They are attracted to each other, which complicates her relationship with her boyfriend, Alex.\n\nAndrea's relationships become entangled because of her new job. Lily increasingly turns to alcohol and picks up dubious men to relieve the pressure of graduate school. Alex, struggling with his own demanding job as an inner-city schoolteacher, grows frustrated with Andrea's long hours and constant stress. Andrea's relationship with her family also suffers. Matters finally come to a head when her co-worker, Emily, gets mononucleosis and Andrea must travel to Paris with Miranda in her stead. \nIn Paris, she has a surprise encounter with Christian. Later that night, Miranda finally lets down her guard and asks Andrea what she has learned, and where she wants to work afterwards. She promises to place phone calls to people she knows at the \"New Yorker\" on Andrea's behalf once her year is up and suggests she take on some small writing assignments at \"Runway\".\n\nBack at the hotel, Andrea gets urgent calls from Alex and her parents asking her to call them. She does and learns that Lily is comatose after driving drunk and wrecking a car. Though her family and Alex pressure her to return home, she tells Miranda she will honor her commitment to \"Runway\". Miranda is pleased, and says her future in magazine publishing is bright, but phones with another impossible demand at Christian Dior's Paris fashion show. Andrea decides that her family and friends are more important than her job, and realizes to her horror that she is becoming more and more like Miranda. She refuses to comply with Miranda's latest outrageous request, and when Miranda scolds her publicly, Andrea replies, \"Fuck you, Miranda. \"Fuck you\".\" She is fired on the spot, and returns home to reconnect with friends and family. Her romantic relationship with Alex is beyond repair, but they remain friends. Lily recovers and is lucky to receive only community service for her DUI charge.\n\nIn the last chapter Andrea learns her dispute with Miranda made her a minor celebrity when the incident made \"Page Six\". Afraid she has been blacklisted from publishing for good, she moves back with her parents. She works on short fiction and finances her unemployment with profits made from reselling the designer clothing she was provided for her Paris trip. \"Seventeen\" buys one of her stories. At the novel's end, she returns to the Elias-Clark building to discuss a position at one of the company's other magazines and sees Miranda's new junior assistant, who looks as harried and put-upon as she once did.\n\n\nWeisberger stated in publicity materials that Priestly's demands are partial fiction and a composite of actual experiences she and her friends had in their first jobs. Some reviewers state that Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of \"Vogue\", was the inspiration for Priestly. After the film was released, another one of Wintour's assistants was identified as the model for Emily.\n\nKate Betts, a former editor of \"Harper's Bazaar\" who also worked for Wintour at one point in her career, spared no barb in the \"Times Book Review\", stressing the main character's ingratitude at the unique opportunity of working at \"Vogue\": \"[I]f Andrea doesn't ever realize why she should care about Miranda Priestly, why should we care about Andrea, or prize the text for anything more than the cheap frisson of the context?\" Janet Maslin, in the daily paper, joined in: \"a mean-spirited \"Gotcha!\" of a book, one that offers little indication that the author could interestingly sustain a gossip-free narrative ...\".\n\nMaslin avoided naming either the magazine where Weisberger actually worked or the woman she allegedly modeled her main character on. The \"Times\" continued this practice when the film was released.\n\nJennifer Krauss of \"Newsday\" admitted the book had problems, as any first novel might, but praised it as a \"fun, frivolous read\".\n\nThe film version was released on June 30, 2006 by 20th Century Fox. It was produced by Wendy Finerman (\"Forrest Gump\"), freely adapted for the screen by Aline Brosh McKenna and directed by David Frankel. Anne Hathaway played Andrea, Meryl Streep earned critical praise, a win for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination as Miranda, and Emily Blunt played Emily.\n\nProduction took place during fall 2005, on location in New York and Paris. Weisberger herself made a very brief non-speaking cameo appearance as the twins' nanny.\n\nThe film was very successful, taking in over $300 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film for both lead actresses up to that date. In September, Weisberger and Frankel jointly accepted the first-ever Quill \"Variety\" Blockbuster Book to Film Award.\n\nRevenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns, the book's sequel, is set a decade after the events of the first novel. In it, Andy is the editor for a new bridal magazine. But as she plans her own wedding, she remains haunted by her experience with Miranda until the two meet again.\n\nAssociated Press stated, 'The book successfully sprinkles pop culture tidbits to keep up the breezy tone...for this summer, it's a pleasant, entertaining read in a tabloid magazine sort of way.' \"Depatures\" said, \"Miranda Priestly returns, more delightfully terrifying than ever, in this delicious sequel to The Devil Wears Prada.\" Richmond Times-Dispatch called it, \"An excellent page turner for summer vacation.\" BookReporter wrote, 'The reader is pulled into the glitz and glamour reminiscent of the New York Times bestseller \"The Devil Wears Prada\" and the movie adaptation.' \"The Washington Post\" said, 'Miranda is pretty much the only thing that makes this book interesting.' MSN.com called the story \"disconcerting\".\n\nIn 2015, it was reported that Broadway producer Kevin McCollum (who has previously produced the musicals \"Rent\" and \"Avenue Q\" amongst others) had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the films from its back catalog into musicals for the stage. He expressed particular interest in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada\". Early in 2017, it was officially announced by McCollum that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions and Rocket Entertainment, a musical version of \"The Devil Wears Prada\" (influenced by both the film and the book) would be produced. Sir Elton John (who also wrote the scores for \"Billy Elliot\" and \"The Lion King\" amongst others) was announced as the composer for the project and Paul Rudnick (most notable for writing the film \"Sister Act\") would write the lyrics and story. The casting and production schedule is still to be announced but it is aimed to play on Broadway.\n\n"}

He was Professor of European History in the Department of International Relations at Bilkent University, having formerly been a professor at the University of Oxford, lecturer at the University of Cambridge, and adviser to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. He was a board member of the Center for Eurasian Studies (AVIM), an organisation accused by the Centre for Armenian Studies of denying the Armenian Genocide.\n\nStone was born in Kelvinside, Glasgow, the son of Mary Robertson (née Pettigrew, died 1991), a schoolteacher, and Norman Stone, a Flight Lieutenant and Spitfire pilot in World War II who fought in the Battle of Britain. He attended the Glasgow Academy on a scholarship for the children of deceased servicemen – his father having been killed in a training accident in 1942 – and graduated from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge with First Class Honours in Part II of the History tripos (1959–1962). Following his undergraduate degree, Stone did research in Central European history in Vienna and Budapest (1962–65), studying archives on the Austro-Hungarian Army from the years before 1914. During this period he spent three months imprisoned in Bratislava, having been caught trying to smuggle a Hungarian dissident in his car boot across the Iron Curtain at the Czech-Austrian border.\n\nStone did not complete his doctorate, having been offered a research fellowship by Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he later became an Assistant Lecturer in Russian and German History (1967), and a full Lecturer (1973). In 1971, he transferred from Caius to Jesus College. While Stone was well regarded as a teacher, over time he increasingly neglected his duties.\n\nStone was appointed in 1984 as Professor of Modern History at Oxford University, England. Stone's tenure at Oxford was not without controversy. Petronella Wyatt wrote that Stone \"loathed the place as petty and provincial, and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.\" During his period at Oxford Stone also gained a reputation for groping female students.\n\nStone published a column in \"The Sunday Times\" between 1987 and 1992, and was also employed by the BBC, the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", and \"The Wall Street Journal\". Stone became Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy advisor on Europe, as well as her speech writer.\n\nIn May 1994 Stone gave a half-hour \"Opinions\" lecture televised on Channel 4 and subsequently published in \"The Independent\". That newspaper later reviewed the lecture as \"Little England has never had such great lines: there were the Germans (They want to be good Europeans because it stops them being bad Germans), and the Scandinavians (They only unite around the principle of finding the goody-goody Swedes very irritating)... But as he led us through the corridors of EC lunacy, you saw the point: only through a Lewis Carroll mirror could you meet such grotesques as the Gatt kings: Not so long ago a cow cost more than a student. Nowadays, a non-cow costs even more ... On 1 September 1939, the League (of Nations) ignored Hitler's invasion of Poland because it was embarrassing, it moved instead to discuss the standardisation of level-crossings.\"\n\nIn 1997, Stone retired from his chair at Oxford and left to teach at the department of International Relations at Bilkent University, Ankara. As an example of Stone's wit and acute understanding, Niall Ferguson shares in his obituary paper , the answer Stone gave when asked why he had moved : \"in the depth of my being, I'm a Scotsman and feel entirely at home in an enlightenment that has failed\". \n\nIn 2005 Stone transferred to Koç University, Istanbul. He later returned to Bilkent University to teach for the 2007-2008 academic year. He guest lectured at Bogazici University, Istanbul. After moving to Turkey, Stone became a frequent contributor to \"Cornucopia\", a magazine about the history and culture of Turkey. In 2010, Stone published a book on Turkish history, from the 11th century to the present day, \"Turkey: A Short History\".\n\nStone was criticised for an obituary he wrote in 1983 for the \"London Review of Books\" of E. H. Carr, denouncing Carr's support of the Soviet Union, which some felt bordered on the defamatory.\n\nStone questioned the use of the word genocide in connection with the deaths of approximately 1.5 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during World War One, arousing significant controversy. In 2004, he took part in a notable letter exchange on the pages of \"The Times Literary Supplement\", where he strongly criticized Peter Balakian's 2003 book \"The Burning Tigris\", saying that Balakian \"should stick to the poems\". Stone praised Guenter Lewy, Bernard Lewis and France-based scholar Gilles Veinstein, all of whom do not believe a genocide took place.\n\nIn 2009, he argued: \"The myth of Winston Churchill is dangerous. Was it a sensible strategy in 1944 and 1945 to bomb Germany to bits? It was very bad realpolitik, whatever its moral purpose.\"\n\nIn his obituary of Stone in The Guardian, the historian Richard J. Evans stated that Stone had not been well regarded by other historians and his \"provocations were little more than the voicing of his own personal political prejudices, and so had little or no effect on the way we think about the past\". The Conservative Member of the European Parliament Daniel Hannan criticised Evans' obituary as 'a poisonous attack [on Stone] ... masquerading as a Guardian obituary'. \n\nStone's book of greatest note is \"The Eastern Front 1914-1917\" (1975) which won the Wolfson History Prize. He also wrote \"Hitler\" (1980), \"Europe Transformed\" 1878-1919 (1983), which won the Fontana History of Europe Prize, and \"World War I: A Short History\" (2007). He mostly wrote about historical events in the past century and specifically was an expert on both World Wars.\n\nWhile in Vienna in the 1960s, Stone met (Marie) Nicole Aubry, the niece of the finance minister in \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier's Haiti government. They married on 2 July 1966 and had two sons, Nicholas “Nick” (born 1966), a thriller writer, and Sebastian (born 1972). Stone and his first wife divorced in 1977. On 11 August 1982, he married Christine Margaret Booker (née Verity), a leading member of the British Helsinki Human Rights Group. They had a son, Rupert (born 1983), and remained married until her death on 15 November 2016.\n\nStone owned a house in the Galata neighbourhood of Istanbul, and divided his time between Turkey and England. He spent the last years of his life in Budapest.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1937992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937992", "title": "Shepseskare", "text": "Shepseskare\n\nShepseskare or Shepseskara (Egyptian for \"Noble is the Soul of Ra\") was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty (2494–2345 BC) during the Old Kingdom period. Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction.\n\nFollowing historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung.\n\nShepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.\n\nShepseskare was a king of Ancient Egypt, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty. Egypt was unified at the time, with its capital located at Memphis. Shepseskare is the least-known king of the Fifth Dynasty as very few artefacts dating to his reign have survived to this day. Only two cylinder seals of Shepseskare are known: one, made of bronze, bears Shepseskare's Horus name and was uncovered in the ruins of Memphis in the early 20th century. The second seal, of unknown provenance, is made of black serpentine and reads \"Shepseskare beloved of the gods, Shepseskare beloved of Hathor\". Beyond these two seals the only surviving artefacts attributable to Shepseskare are five fragments of seal impressions on clay from Abusir and six further fragments discovered in the mortuary temple and Sanctuary of the Knife of the Pyramid of Neferefre, also in Abusir. These fragments probably come from three different seals and were most likely placed on the doors of magazine rooms in the temple.\nFinally, there is a single scarab seal reading \"Shepeskare\" that the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie attributed to Shepseskare at the end of the 19th century. Modern scholars doubt this attribution and rather believe the scarab to be a work of the much later Saite period (685–525 BC) executed in archaic style. Equally, the scarab could belong to Gemenefkhonsbak Shepeskare, an obscure kinglet of Tanis during the 25th Dynasty (760–656 BC).\n\nThe only ancient Egyptian king list mentioning Shepseskare is the Saqqara Tablet (on the 28th entry). The tablet was inscribed during the reign of Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC), around 1200 years after Shepseskare's lifetime, and records the dynastic succession Neferikare → Shepseskare → Neferkhare (a variant name of Neferefre).\nShepseskare is completely absent from another king list dating to the same period: the Abydos king list, written during the reign of Seti I (1294–1279 BC). He is also absent from the Turin canon (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a lacuna affects the papyrus on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should have been. Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the papyrus also makes it impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.\n\nShepseskare was also likely mentioned in the \"Aegyptiaca\", a history of Egypt written in the third century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. Africanus relates that the \"Aegyptiaca\" mentioned the succession \"Nefercheres → Sisires → Cheres\" for the mid Fifth Dynasty. Nefercheres and Cheres are believed to be the hellenized forms for Neferirkare and Neferkhare (that is Neferefre), respectively. Thus, \"Sisires\" is traditionally believed to be the Greek name of Shepseskare, making Manetho's reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty in good agreement with the Saqqara tablet. Furthermore, according to Africanus, Manetho credits Sisires with seven years of reign while other sources report Manetho's figure as nine years.\n\nBoth the relative chronological position and absolute dates of Shepseskare's reign are uncertain.\nThe Saqqara Tablet records Shepseskare as the successor of Neferirkare Kakai and the predecessor of Neferefre, which became the traditional opinion among Egyptologists. Following discoveries in the early 1980s, the Czech Egyptologist Miroslav Verner advocates the hypothesis that Shepseskare succeeded, rather than preceded, Neferefre.\n\nIn support of this hypothesis, Verner first emphasizes the presence of several clay seal impressions bearing Shepseskare's Horus name \"Sekhemkaw\" (meaning \"He whose apparitions are powerful\") in the oldest part of Neferere's mortuary temple, which was not built \"until Neferefre's death\". This appears to suggest that Shepseskare ruled after—rather than before—Neferefre.\nVerner's second argument concerns the alignment of pyramids of Sahure, Neferirkare Kakai and Neferefre: they form a line pointing to Heliopolis, just as the three pyramids of Giza do. In contrast, Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid does not fall on the line to Heliopolis, which strongly suggests that Neferefre's pyramid had already been in place when Shepseskare started his. Finally, Verner observes that Neferefre is known to have been Neferirkare's eldest son and around 20 years old when his father died so that he was in optimal position to inherit the throne. Shespeskare thus most likely took the throne after Neferefre. As Verner notes, while Shepseskare is noted as the immediate predecessor of Neferefre in the Saqqara tablet, \"this slight discrepancy can ... be attributed to the [political] disorders of the time and its dynastic disputes.\"\n\nIn two articles published in 2000 and 2001 Verner argues that, contrary to what Manetho indicates, Shepseskare must have reigned for a couple of months at the most, a hypothesis already proposed by the French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal in 1988.\nVerner's conclusion is based on the archeological record, in particular Shepseskare's intended pyramid at Abusir. Verner emphasizes that the progress of the pyramid, which is unfinished,\nwas interrupted [and] corresponds to the work of several weeks, perhaps no more than one or two months. In fact, the place was merely leveled and the excavation of the pit for the construction of the underground funerary apartment had only commenced. Moreover, the owner of the building obviously wanted to demonstrate by his choice of place (half-way between Sahure's pyramid and the sun temple of Userkaf) his relationship to either Sahure or Userkaf. Theoretically, only two kings of the Fifth Dynasty whose pyramids had not yet been identified can be taken into consideration – Shepseskara or Menkauhor. However, according to a number of contemporaneous documents, Menkauhor ... probably completed [his] pyramid elsewhere, in North Saqqara or Dahshur. Shepseskara, therefore, seems to be the likelier owner of the unfinished platform for a pyramid in North Abusir. Anyway, the builder of the platform [viz., Shepseskare] must have reigned for a very short time.\nThe rediscovery in 2008 of the Headless Pyramid in Saqqara and its subsequent attribution to Menkauhor Kaiu by the excavators under the direction of Zahi Hawass confirms Verner's attribution of the unfinished pyramid of Abusir to Shepseskare.\n\nUnlike the other kings of the Fifth Dynasty, Shepseskare's name appears neither in the personal names of people of the time nor in the names of funerary estates. He is also absent from the titles and biographies of state officials. For example, the stela of the Fifth Dynasty official Khau-Ptah lists an uninterrupted sequence of kings whom he served under, namely Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre and Nyuserre. The omission of Shepseskare, be it between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre, indicates that his reign must have been very short. Since Manetho's \"Aegyptiaca\" dates to the third century BC, Khau-Ptah's contemporary account can be regarded as a more accurate indication of the political situation during the Fifth Dynasty.\n\nVerner's arguments together with the scarcity of artefacts attributable to Shepseskare have now convinced many Egyptologists, such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung, that Shepseskare's reign was indeed ephemeral.\n\nIn view of the scarcity of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely a member of the royal family, although the possibility that he was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.\n\nSilke Roth has proposed that Shepseskare was a son of Neferirkare Kakai and a brother of both Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini. Instead, Verner has proposed that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure who managed to briefly seize power after the premature death of Neferefre. This would explain the proximity of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid to that of Sahure. Lending credence to this theory is the discovery by Verner and Tarek El Awady in 2005 of reliefs from the causeway of Sahure's pyramid complex showing him, his wife Meretnebty and their two sons Ranefer and Netjerirenre. The relief gives both sons the title of \"king's eldest son\", indicating that they were possibly twins. The relief further indicates that Ranefer took the throne as \"Neferirkare king of Upper and Lower Egypt\". Verner and Awady thus speculate that while Ranefer and his son Neferefre became kings, Netjerirenre could have attempted to seize the throne at the death of the latter. In this hypothesis Shepseskare would be the throne name of Netjerirenre. Verner had however himself written in 1997 that Shepseskare could equally be a son of Shepseskaf, last pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty, or of Userkaf or Neferirkare Kakai as Roth suggested: so few are the actual evidences pertaining to the problem that all possibilities are just speculations. In yet another hypothesis, Jaromír Krejčí believes that Shepseskare was Neferefre's son.\n\nShepseskare's reign may have been cut short by his unexpected death or his claim to the throne could have been thwarted by Nyuserre Ini, Neferefre's younger brother and the younger son of King Neferirkare and Queen Khentkaus II. Khentkaus II's pivotal role in Nyuserre's eventual accession to the throne might explain her high esteem in Egyptian folklore and \"the additional enlargement and upgrading of her mortuary temple\" by Nyuserre. Nyuserre also seemed to have been favored by powerful courtiers and officials, foremost among whom was Ptahshepses, who would become Nyuserre's son-in-law and vizier.\n\nAn unfinished pyramid located in north Abusir, between the sun temple of Userkaf and the Pyramid of Sahure, is believed to belong to Shepseskare. The structure was discovered in 1980 by a Czechoslovakian archaeological team led by Miroslav Verner and seems to have been abandoned after no more than a few weeks or months of work. A square area of roughly was leveled and the digging of a T-shaped ditch was just started in its center. This ditch was to be left open during the pyramid construction to allow for simultaneous works on the pyramid filling and its substructures. This construction technique is common to all pyramids of the Fifth Dynasty and can directly be seen in the case of the Pyramid of Neferefre, which was also left unfinished. This technique as well as the location of the unfinished pyramid in the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty indicates that it belonged in all likeliness to Shepseskare, the pyramids of the other kings of the dynasty being already known. If finished according to the established pattern, the pyramid would have reached high, similar to the Pyramid of Neferirkare.\n\nAnalyzing the fragments of clay seals bearing Shepeseskare's name, the Swiss Egyptologist Peter Kaplony has proposed that the ancient name of Shepseskare's pyramid could be reconstructed as \"Rsj-Špss-k3-Rˁ\", reading \"Resj-Shespeskare\" and meaning \"The awakening of Shepseskare\". Verner rejects this hypothesis, and he contests the reading of certain signs and their interpretation as the name of a pyramid.\n\nKaplony has proposed that Shepseskare started to build a sun temple named \"Ḥtp-jb-Rˁ\", reading \"Hotepibre\" and meaning \"Satisfied is the heart of Ra\". Although all the kings of the early to mid-Fifth Dynasty, from Userkaf to Menkauhor Kaiu, did build sun temples, Verner regards Kaplony's hypothesis as \"sheer speculation\" since it is based on the tentative reconstruction of a single clay seal. Verner first argues that this seal is not inscribed with Shepseskare's name but rather bears traces of a Horus name which could equally well be that of Djedkare Isesi. Second, Verner notes that the name of a sun temple is rarely found with that of the king who built it: more often it is found with the name of another king during whose reign the seal was made. Finally, he doubts that the sign reading \"Ḥtp\", \"Hotep\", is really part of the name of a sun temple. Instead, he believes it is more probable that the seal either refers to the sun temple of Neferirkare, named \"St-jb-Rˁ.w\", that is \"Setibraw\"; or to that of Nyuserre, which was called \"Šsp-jb-Rˁ\", \"Shesepibraw\".\n\nIt is possible that Shepseskare continued the construction of the funerary complex of his predecessor. As Neferefre had died after a short reign, his pyramid complex was far from finished and neither the burial chamber nor the mortuary temple had been built. The planned pyramid was thus hastily changed into a square mastaba representing a stylized primeval hill and the accompanying mortuary temple was completed during the reign of Nyuserre.\nThe presence of seals of Shepseskare in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple could indicate that the former also undertook construction works there. The evidence for such works is uncertain: these seals could have been placed on boxes which were later moved into the magazine rooms of the temple. For example, seals of Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai were also found in the temple, while these three pharaohs died before Neferefre's reign.\n"}

{"id": "1938004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938004", "title": "Golden Dawn (political party)", "text": "Golden Dawn (political party)\n\nThe Popular Association – Golden Dawn (, \"Laïkós Sýndesmos – Chrysí Avgí\"), usually known as Golden Dawn (, \"Chrysí Avgí\" ), is a far-right, neo-Nazi, and fascist political party in Greece. Though the group rejects these labels, its members have expressed admiration for the former Greek dictators Ioannis Metaxas of the 4th of August Regime (1936–1941) and Georgios Papadopoulos of the Regime of the Colonels (1967–1974). They have also made use of alleged Nazi symbolism, and have praised figures of Nazi Germany in the past. According to academic sources, the group is racist and xenophobic, and the party's leader has openly identified the policies as nationalist and has showed racist rhetoric.\n\nNikolaos Michaloliakos began the foundations of what would become Golden Dawn in 1980, when he published the first issue of the right-wing, pro-military junta journal with that name. In this context, Golden Dawn had its origins in the movement that worked towards a return to right-wing military dictatorship in Greece. Following an investigation into the 2013 murder of Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, by a supporter of the party, Michaloliakos and several other Golden Dawn MPs and members were arrested and held in pre-trial detention on suspicion of forming a criminal organization. The trial began on 20 April 2015 and is ongoing . Golden Dawn later lost all of its remaining seats in the Greek Parliament in the 2019 Greek legislative election. A 2020 survey showed the party's popularity plummeting to just 1.5%, down from 2.9% in previous year's elections.\n\nAfter being founded in 1985, Golden Dawn first received widespread attention in 1991, and in 1993 registered as a political party. By this time Golden Dawn had adopted several southern Balkan focused regional objectives as its main programme: to promote the idea of a Greater Greece through the expansion of Greek territory into southern Albania (Northern Epirus), the Republic of North Macedonia, and southern Bulgaria, and ultimately Greece's reconquest of Constantinople (modern day Istanbul) and western Anatolia through war with Turkey. They also called to push for the complete Hellenisation of Greek Macedonia and Western Thrace through the expulsion of Northern Greece's last remaining Macedonian-speaking minority (or so-called Slavophone Greeks) and the Turkish-speaking Muslim minority of East Macedonia and Thrace that were settled during the Ottoman period (see Western Thrace Turks). They also aspire \"to combat Islam in the region\", such as through contributing fighters to the Greek Volunteer Guard that helped capture Srebrenica.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, Golden Dawn had redirected its attention to opposing non-European, and particularly Muslim, immigration into the mainly Greek areas of southern Greece and Athens. Golden Dawn had temporarily ceased political operations in 2005 and was absorbed by the Patriotic Alliance. The Alliance, in turn, ceased operations after Michaloliakos withdrew support in the spring of 2007. Golden Dawn held its sixth congress, in March 2007, where party officials announced the resumption of political activities. At local elections on 7 November 2010 Golden Dawn got 5.3% of the vote in the municipality of Athens, winning a seat at the City Council. In some neighbourhoods with large immigrant communities it reached 20%.\n\nThe party ran a campaign during the May 2012 Greek national elections based on concerns about unemployment, austerity, the economy, and immigration, which gained a large increase in support from the Greek electorate. It received 7% of the popular vote, enough for the party to enter the Hellenic Parliament for the first time with 21 seats. Following a second election in June 2012, this was reduced to 18 seats. As a result of the January 2015 Greek national elections, the party became the third largest in Parliament, despite winning only 17 seats.\n\nThe party is hard Eurosceptic. It is also anti-globalist.\n\nIn 2015, Golden Dawn outlined their 'National Plan' for Greece's recovery from the financial crisis as follows:\n\nIn December 1980, Nikolaos Michaloliakos and a group of supporters launched \"Chrysi Avgi\" magazine. Michaloliakos had been active in far-right politics for many years, having been arrested several times for politically motivated offences, such as beatings and illegal possession of explosive materials, which led to his discharge from the military. While he was in prison, Michaloliakos met the leaders of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 and laid the foundations of the Golden Dawn party. According to the newspaper \"Eleftherotypia\" the characteristics of the magazine and the organisation were clearly National Socialist. \"Chrysi Avgi\" magazine ceased publication in April 1984, when Michaloliakos joined the National Political Union and took over the leadership of its youth section. In January 1985, he broke away from the National Political Union and founded the Popular National Movement – Golden Dawn, which was officially recognised as a political party in 1993.\n\nGolden Dawn remained largely on the margins of far-right politics until the Macedonia naming dispute in 1991 and 1992. The Greek newspaper \"Eleftherotypia\" reported that on 10 October 1992, about 30 Golden Dawn members attacked students at the Athens University of Economics and Business during a massive demonstration against the use of the name \"Macedonia\" by the then Republic of Macedonia. Around the same time, the first far-right street gangs appeared under the leadership of Giannis Giannopoulos, a former military officer who was involved with the South African Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) during the 1980s. After the events of 1991 and 1992, Golden Dawn had gained a stable membership of more than 200 members, and Giannopoulos rose within the party hierarchy. Golden Dawn ran in the 1994 European Parliament election, gaining 7,264 votes nationwide; 0.1% of the votes cast.\n\nDuring the 1980s the party embraced Hellenic Neopagan beliefs, praised the Twelve Olympians and described Marxism and liberalism as \"the ideological carriers of Judeo-Christianity\". The party went through ideological changes later and welcomed Greek Orthodox Christianity.\n\nA number of Golden Dawn members participated during the Bosnian War in the Greek Volunteer Guard (GVG), which was part of the Drina Corps of the Army of Republika Srpska. A few GVG volunteers were present in Srebrenica during the Srebrenica massacre, and they raised a Greek flag at a ruined church after the fall of the town. Spiros Tzanopoulos, a GVG sergeant who took part in the attack against Srebrenica, said many of the Greek volunteers participated in the war because they were members of Golden Dawn. Golden Dawn members in the GVG were decorated by Radovan Karadžić, but, according to Charis Kousoumvris, a former member of Golden Dawn, those who were decorated, later left the party.\n\nIn April 1996, Giannopoulos represented the party at a pan-European convention of far-right nationalist parties in Moscow, where he presented a bust of Alexander the Great to Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky for his birthday. Golden Dawn participated in the 1996 legislative election in September, receiving 4,487 votes nationwide; 0.07% of the votes cast. In October 1997, Giannopoulos published an article in \"Chrysi Avgi\" magazine calling for nationalist vigilantism against immigrants and liberals. In 1998, a prominent party member, Antonios Androutsopoulos, assaulted Dimitris Kousouris, a left-wing student activist. The resulting media attention, along with internal party conflicts (due to poor results in the 1996 elections), led some of its most extreme members to gradually fade from official party affairs.\n\nAndroutsopoulos finally surrendered in 2005 and was convicted of the attempted murder of Kousouris and another two left-wing activists, for which he received a 21-year prison term. The rest of the members of the squad that hit Kousouris were never legally prosecuted. In March 2009, Androutsopoulos appealed his sentence and received 12 years, to be finally released from prison a few months later. Meanwhile, Golden Dawn continued to hold rallies and marches, and it ran in the 1999 European election in an alliance with the Front Line party, gaining 48,532 votes nationwide; 0.75% of the votes cast. In 2005, \"Eleftherotypia\" reported that Golden Dawn members distributed homophobic flyers during the first pride parade held in Athens.\n\nAccording to Golden Dawn's leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, the party suspended its own autonomous political activities after 1 December 2005 because of clashes with anarchists. Golden Dawn members were instructed to continue their activism within the Patriotic Alliance party, which was very closely linked to Golden Dawn. The former leader of Patriotic Alliance, Dimitrios Zaphiropoulos, was once a member of Golden Dawn's political council, and Michaloliakos became a leading member of Patriotic Alliance. There were accusations that the \"Patriotic Alliance\" was simply the new name of Golden Dawn. Activities by Patriotic Alliance's members were often attributed to Golden Dawn (even by themselves), creating confusion. This is the main reason Golden Dawn's members announced the withdrawal of their support of the Patriotic Alliance, which eventually led to the interruption of Golden Dawn's political activities. In March 2007, Golden Dawn held its sixth congress and announced the resumption of their political and ideological activism.\n\nIn May 2012, WordPress shut down Golden Dawn's official website and blog due to death threats against Xenia Kounalaki, a journalist.\n\nIn 2018, Ilias Kasidiaris, a leading member of the party, declared himself an admirer of the Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and added that the only non-hypocritical European countries were those of Visegrad. He asked why Muslim migrants did not go to Saudi Arabia or other Islamic countries, and explained \"We at Golden Dawn want to give priority to Christian asylum seekers. And, in any event, Greece cannot continue to welcome everyone in. If we ever get into power, we will put economic migrants in jail, instead of hosting them in hotspots, as Syriza does.\"\n\nIn an article in March 2019, the leader of the party, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, concluded that \"The only way to stop the destruction of our nation is to fight hard in order to make our Fatherland a national state again, a Greece that will belong to the Greeks.\"\n\nDuring the 2019 European Parliament election Golden Dawn won only 4.88% of the vote and won only 2 seats, down from 9.4% and 3 seats in 2014. During the 2019 Greek Legislative election Golden Dawn lost all of its 18 seats in the Hellenic Parliament, winning only 2.93% of the vote, down from 7.0% in 2015. Shortly after the elections, one of the Golden Dawn's two MEP, Giannis Lagos, abandoned the party and refused to hand over his seat, and thus, leaving GD with just 1 seat in the European Parliament.\n\nOn 8 July 2019, after the election result, the party leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos has made the following statement: \"We send a message to enemies and friends. The Golden Dawn is not over. The struggle for nationalism continues. We will be back where we were strong, in the streets and squares, and we will fight hard against Bolshevism and the cruel capitalism that is coming.\"\n\nIn September 2019, Golden Dawn's headquarters in Athens, were closed and dissolved, only two months after the party's defeat in the July general elections. The NGO KEERFA described this development as being \"a victory of the anti-fascist movement\". The party's website also became unavailable.\n\nGolden Dawn claimed to have local organisations in 32 Greek cities, as well as in Cyprus.\n\nThe party created the \"Committee of National Memory\" (Επιτροπή Εθνικής Μνήμης, \"Epitropí Ethnikís Mnímis\"), to organise demonstrations commemorating the anniversaries of certain Greek national events. Since 1996, the Committee of National Memory has organized an annual march, usually on 31 January in Athens, in memory of three Greek officers who died during the Imia military crisis. According to the European National Front website, the march in 2006 was attended by 2,500 people, although no neutral sources have confirmed that number. The Committee of National Memory has continued its activities, and a march took place on 31 January 2010.\n\nThe Committee of National Memory has organized annual rallies on 17 June in Thessalonica, in memory of Alexander the Great. Police confronted the participants of the rally of 2006, forcing Golden Dawn and Patriotic Alliance members to leave the area after conflicts with leftist groups. Later that day, Golden Dawn members gathered in the building of state-owned television channel ERT3 and held a protest as they tried to stop the channel from broadcasting. Police surrounded the building and arrested 48 Golden Dawn members.\n\nIn September 2005, Golden Dawn attempted to organise a festival called \"Eurofest 2005 – Nationalist Summer Camp\" at the grounds of a Greek summer camp. The planned festival depended on the participation of the German National Democratic Party of Germany, the Italian Forza Nuova and the Romanian Noua Dreaptă, as well as Spanish and other European far-right groups, as European National Front's festival. The festival was banned by the government.\n\nIn June 2007, Golden Dawn sent representatives to protest against the G8 convention in Germany, together with the National Democratic Party of Germany and other European far-right organisations.\n\nIn June 2011, \"Foreign Policy\" reported that in the midst of the 2010–2011 Greek protests, gangs of Golden Dawn members were increasingly being seen in some of the higher-crime areas of Athens. In May 2012, the BBC reported on how Golden Dawn had become sort of a local 'Robin Hood' in some high-immigration areas of Athens, since the party was developing a social program which included the delivery of free or minimal cost food among the most unfavored strata of ethnic Greeks. The party offers protection for victims of crime, a service that has been appreciated by citizens and utilized by the police, which refers Athenians to the Golden Dawn for help, especially when immigrant crime is involved. The party, however, demands allegiance in return for their service.\n\nGolden Dawn's Youth Front has distributed fliers with nationalist messages in Athens schools and organised the concert series Rock Against Communism. It publishes the ultranationalist magazine \"Resistance Hellas-Antepithesi\". The magazine is a sister publication of the United States-based National Alliance's \"Resistance\" magazine.\n\nIn May 2009, Golden Dawn took part in the European elections and received 23,564 votes, 0.5% of the total votes.\nIn 2010 it won 5.3% of the vote in Athens. In that election, the party won its first municipal council seat and entered parliament for the first time in 2012. In the Greek parliamentary elections of May 2012, the party received 6.97% of the popular vote. In the rerun of the elections in June 2012, their share of the vote was 6.92%. This made them the third largest group from Greece to the European Parliament (largest was Syriza's alliance.)\n\nOne representative elected in 2014, Eleftherios Synadinos, left the party in 2018.\n\nMembers of Golden Dawn have been accused of carrying out acts of violence and hate crimes against immigrants, political opponents, homosexuals and ethnic minorities. Golden Dawn's offices have been attacked repeatedly by anarchists and other leftists, and clashes between members of Golden Dawn and leftists have not been unusual.\n\nIn 2000, unknown suspects vandalized the Monastirioton synagogue, a memorial for Holocaust victims, and Jewish cemeteries in Thessaloniki and Athens. There were claims that Golden Dawn's symbols were present at all four sites. The \"KIS\", the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece, the Coalition of the Left, of Movements and Ecology, the Greek Helsinki Monitor and others issued statements condemning these acts. The Cyprus chapter of Golden Dawn has been accused of attacks against Turkish Cypriots, and one member was arrested for attacking Turkish Cypriots in 2005.\n\nOn 6 October 1999, during a football match between Greece and Albania in Athens, Albanian supporters burnt a Greek flag in their stand. This act was captured and broadcast extensively by the Greek media, leading to a series of angry reactions by Greek nationalists against foreign immigrants. In a specific case, on the night of 22 October, Pantelis Kazakos, a nationalist and a member of the Golden Dawn, said he felt \"insulted by the burning of the Greek flag\" and shot and killed two people and wounded seven others in an attack in central Athens. All of the victims were immigrants, and four of the wounded remain paralysed. Other Golden Dawn members, feeling also \"insulted by the burning of the Greek flag\", formed the hooligan firm \"Galazia Stratia\" (Greek for \"Blue Army\"). It has described itself as a \"fan club of the Greek national teams\" and its goal as \"to defend Greek national pride inside the stadiums.\" It has been reported that following Golden Dawn's official disbandment in 2005, many former party members have put most of their energy into promoting \"Galazia Stratia\". \"Galazia Stratia\" is closely linked to Golden Dawn, and the two groups shared the same street address. Golden Dawn made no attempt to deny the connections, openly praising the actions of \"Galazia Stratia\" in its newspaper, and accepting praise in return from the firm.\n\n\"Galazia Stratia\" and Golden Dawn have been accused of various acts of sports-related violence. In September 2004, after a football match between Greece and Albania in Tirana (which Greece lost 2–1), Albanian immigrants living in Greece went out on the streets of Athens and other cities to celebrate the victory. Greek hooligans felt provoked by this and violence erupted against Albanian immigrants in various parts of Greece, resulting in the murder of an Albanian in Zakynthos and many others being injured. Golden Dawn and \"Galazia Stratia\" were proven to be directly responsible for many of the attacks. According to \"Eleftherotypia\", \"Galazia Stratia\" members severely assaulted a Palestinian and a Bangladeshi during celebrations following the success of the Greek national basketball team at the 2006 FIBA World Championship.\n\nAntonios Androutsopoulos (aka \"Periandros\"), a prominent member of Golden Dawn, was a fugitive from 1998 to 14 September 2005 after being accused of the attempted murder on 16 June 1998 of three left-wing students – including Dimitris Kousouris, who was badly injured. Androutsopoulos had been sentenced \"in absentia\" to four years of prison for illegal weapon possession while the attempted murder charges against him were still standing.\n\nThe authorities' failure to apprehend Androutsopoulos for seven years prompted criticism by the Greek media. An article in \"Ta Nea\" claimed that Periandros remained in Greece and evaded arrest because of his connections with the police. In an interview in 2004, Michalis Chrisochoidis, the former minister of public order and a member of PASOK, claimed that such accusations were unfounded, and he blamed the inefficiency of the Greek police. Some allege that Androutsopoulos had evaded arrest because he had been residing in Venezuela until 2005 when he turned himself in. His trial began on 20 September 2006, and he was convicted on 25 September 2006; he was sentenced to 21 years in prison. Golden Dawn members were present at his trial, shouting nationalist slogans; he reportedly hailed them using the Nazi salute.\n\nOn 2 February 2008, Golden Dawn planned to hold the annual march for the twelfth anniversary of the Imia military crisis. Anti-fascist groups organised a protest in order to cancel the march, as a response to racist attacks allegedly caused by Golden Dawn members. Golden Dawn members occupied the square in which the march was to take place, and when anti-fascists showed up, clashes occurred. During the riots that followed, Golden Dawn members were seen attacking the anti-fascists with riot police doing nothing to stop them and actually letting them pass through their lines. This led to two people being stabbed and another two wounded by rocks. There were allegations that Golden Dawn members even carried police equipment with them and that Golden Dawn's equipment was carried inside a police van.\n\nOn 7 September 1993 a bomb exploded at Golden Dawn's offices. The attack was attributed to the far-left terrorist organization Revolutionary People's Struggle (ELA).\n\nIn November 2005, Golden Dawn's offices were attacked by a group of Anarchists with molotov cocktails and stones. There were gunshots, and two people (who claimed that they were just passing by) were injured. According to Golden Dawn, three suspects were arrested and set free. During the subsequent police investigation, leftovers from molotov cocktails were discovered in Golden Dawn's offices. Golden Dawn has stated that this was the reason for the organisation's disbandment.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, a bomb described by police as of \"moderate power\" was detonated in the fifth floor office of Golden Dawn, in downtown Athens. Twenty-five minutes prior to the blast, an unidentified caller contacted a local newspaper in order to announce the attack. The targeted building and the surrounding area were evacuated in response. The explosion caused substantial property damage but no casualties. The office reopened on 10 April 2010. The responsibility for the attack claimed by the anarchist terrorist organization Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei.\n\nOn 4 December 2012, a makeshift bomb containing dynamite exploded at Golden Dawn's office building in Aspropyrgos, a suburb of Athens. The explosion caused significant damage to two floors but produced no casualties.\n\nOn 13 February 2013 an improvised bomb exploded in the regional office of Golden Dawn in Piraeus. The explosion and the subsequent fire caused material damage. Next morning a similar improvised bomb exploded outside the offices of Golden Dawn in the city of Larissa, central Greece. The explosion caused only material damage.\n\nOn 7 June 2012, Golden Dawn spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris slapped Communist MP Liana Kanelli about the head three times during a live debate on the morning show \"Proino ANT1\"; she had thrown a newspaper and verbal abuse at him during the previous commercial break. Kasidiaris was subsequently locked in a room by the staff of the ANT1 TV station, but he knocked down the door and left. Greek prosecutors issued an arrest warrant. Golden Dawn blamed Kanelli for the incident. The incident resulted in several protests against Golden Dawn in Athens and other Greek cities. Political analyst Theodore Couloumbis told Reuters that the incident could cost Golden Dawn votes, especially among women, though other experts were of the opinion that images of violence could play in their favour—a Facebook page dedicated to Kasidiaris picked up 6,000 'likes' within 24 hours.\n\nIn September 2013, a 35-year-old man alleged to have had ties to Golden Dawn was arrested for murder after Pavlos Fyssas, known as hip-hop artist Killah P, was stabbed twice following a brawl in Piraeus. The police later raided Golden Dawn offices in Athens. The party denies any alleged connections to the murder. An ongoing investigation has since confirmed that the man was in contact with party members prior to and at the time of the murder. A subsequent police crackdown led to raids on Golden Dawn offices and the arrests of several party members, including party leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos, who was imprisoned as a result of owning the office phone to which a telephone call, alleged to be associated with the murder, was received.\n\nOn 1 November 2013, Golden Dawn members Giorgos Fountoulis and Manos Kapelonis were shot dead outside the party's offices in Neo Irakleio, a northern suburb of Athens. A third, Alexandros Gerontas, was severely injured. Police described the event as a terrorist attack. Two weeks later, the anarchist terrorist group \"The Fighting People's Revolutionary Powers\" claimed responsibility for what it described as the \"political executions of the fascist members of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party\".\n\nDuring April, supporters were present in Piraeus, where they came into conflict with supporters of refugees, and additionally in Chios, where they fought with police from Athens, after having attacked migrants and refugees there.\n\nIn an interview with \"Eleftherotypia\" in 1998, Minister for Public Order Georgios Romaios (PASOK) alleged the existence of \"fascist elements in the Hellenic Police\", and vowed to suppress them. In a TV interview that same year, Romaios again claimed that there was a pro-fascist group within the police force, although he said it was not organized and was only involved in isolated incidents. The same year, \"Eleftherotypia\" published an article which outlined connections between the police and neo-fascism. Dimitris Reppas, the PASOK government spokesman, strongly denied such connections. However, the article quoted a speech by the PASOK Member of Parliament Paraskevas Paraskevopoulos about a riot caused by right-wing extremists, in which he said:\n\nIn Thessaloniki it is widely discussed that far-right organisations are active in the security forces. Members of such organisations were the planners and chief executioners of the riot and nobody was arrested. A Special Forces officer, speaking at a briefing of Special Forces policemen who were to be on duty that day, told the policemen not to arrest anyone because the rioters were not enemies and threatened that should this be overlooked there would be penalties.\n\nBefore the surrender of Androutsopoulos, an article in the newspaper \"Ta Nea\" claimed that Golden Dawn had a close relationship with elements of the Greek police force. In relation to the Periandros case, the article quoted an unidentified police officer who said that \"half the force wanted Periandros arrested and the other half didn't\". The article claimed that there was a confidential internal police investigation which concluded that:\n\nThe newspaper published a photograph of a typewritten paragraph with no identifiable insignia as evidence of the secret investigation. The Minister for Public Order, Michalis Chrysochoidis, responded that he did not recollect such an investigation. Chrysochoidis also denied accusations that far-right connections within the police force delayed the arrest of Periandros. He said that leftist groups, including the ultra-left anti-state resistance group 17 November, responsible for several murders, had similarly evaded the police for decades. In both cases, he attributed the failures to \"stupidity and incompetence\" by the force.\n\nIn more recent years, anti-fascist and left-wing groups have claimed that many of Golden Dawn's members have close relationships or collaborated with Greece's Central Intelligence Service, the predecessor to the National Intelligence Service, and accused Michaloliakos of working for the KYP from the 1980s. One piece of evidence for this, published in a Greek newspaper, was a payslip showing the names of both Michaloliakos and Konstantinos Plevris as operating for the agency, which Golden Dawn claimed was a forgery. The \"payslip\", which was supposedly \"signed\" by a \"Hellenic army's officer\", was a fake, as was proven in court after Golden Dawn's complaint.\n\nIn July 2012, it was reported that Nils Muižnieks, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, had placed the alleged ties of Greek police and Golden Dawn under scrutiny, following reports of the Greek state's continued failure to acknowledge the problem. In an interview he gave on 2 February 2013 to \"Ta Nea\", Muižnieks stated that he had collected strong evidence of ties between the police and the party. According to the political analyst Paschos Mandravelis, \"A lot of the party's backing comes from the police, young recruits who are apolitical and know nothing about the Nazis or Hitler. For them, Golden Dawn supporters are their only allies on the frontline when there are clashes between riot police and leftists.\"\n\nAfter the Greek Parliamentary elections of 6 May 2012, it became known that more than one out of two Greek police officers voted for Golden Dawn in some districts. Polling stations surrounding the Attica General Police Directorate in the Athens A constituency, where on-duty police officers are known to have voted, reported slightly more than 20% support for the party, whereas \"civilian\" polling stations in the constituency reported support of around 6%. The total percentage of Golden Dawn votes in Athens A was 7.8%. A police official stated that support for the party was high and growing among the police, as well as in the branches of the military.\n\n\nThe party is regularly described as neo-Nazi by news media and academic sources, and members are frequently responsible for anti-semitic graffiti.\n\nThe party denies that it has any official connection to Neo-Nazism. Although it uses the Nazi salute, a salute used by the Italian Fascist and German Nazi movements, it claims to draw its inspiration in this primarily from the 4th of August Regime established by Ioannis Metaxas, the Greek nationalist leader and dictator, whose National Youth Organization (and later, his entire government) adopted upon taking power. Ioannis Metaxas was the dictator of Greece from 1936 to 1941, when he died.\n\nLikewise, the Golden Dawn's meander symbol, while a symbol drawn from Greek art (which the party sees as representing bravery and eternal struggle) uses the same colors as Hitler's NSDAP flag: a red background, a black meander (respectively swastika) and a white border around the meander.\n\nIlias Kasidiaris, a spokesman for Golden Dawn, wrote an article that was published in Golden Dawn magazine on 20 April 2011, in which he said, \"What would the future of Europe and the whole modern world be like if World War II hadn't stopped the renewing route of National Socialism? Certainly, fundamental values which mainly derive from ancient Greek culture, would be dominant in every state and would define the fate of peoples. Romanticism as a spiritual movement and classicism would prevail against the decadent subculture that corroded the white man. Extreme materialism would have been discarded, giving its place to spiritual exaltation\". In the same article, Adolf Hitler is characterized as a \"great social reformer\" and \"military genius\".\n\nIn an article published in 1987 in the Golden Dawn magazine titled \"Hitler for 1,000 years\", its editor Michaloliakos showed his support for Nazism and white supremacy. Specifically he wrote, \"We are the faithful soldiers of the National Socialist idea and nothing else\" and \"[...] WE EXIST, and continue the battle, the battle for the final victory of our race\". He ends the article by writing \"1987, 42 years later, with our thought and soul given to the last great battle, with our thought and soul given to the black and red banners, with our thought and soul given to the memory of our great Leader, we raise our right hand up, we salute the Sun and with the courage, that is compelled by our military honor and our National Socialist duty we shout full of passion, faith to the future and our visions: HEIL HITLER!\". Furthermore, he uses capital letters for pronouns referring to Hitler (\"by Himself\", \"His people\").\n\nOn 17 August 1987, Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy in the Nazi Party, committed suicide in Spandau Prison. The following day, on 18 August 1987, Golden Dawn members distributed proclamations in the center of Athens with the phrase \"Rudolf Hess Immortal\" ().\n\nIn pictures taken during the first congress of Golden Dawn in February 1990, the congress hall is decorated with the Swastika and the Wolfsangel.\n\nThere are many cases in which Golden Dawn members have appeared to give a Nazi salute. The founder of the party, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, appeared to give a Nazi salute in the Athens city council. He claims that it was merely \"the salute of the national youth organisation of Ioannis Metaxas\".\n\nIn May 2012, Golden Dawn ran in Greek elections under the slogan \"So we can rid this land of filth\". On his post-election statement, the leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, had placed a marble eagle on an obvious position on his desk, which according to media reports bears similarity to the eagle of the Nazi Third Reich. After the elections, Eleni Zaroulia, a Golden Dawn MP, wore an iron cross ring during her inauguration, a symbol which has been associated with Nazism. As depicted in a picture taken on 14 September 2012, Panagiotis Iliopoulos, another Golden Dawn MP, has a tattoo reading the Nazi greeting \"Sieg Heil\".\n\nOn 23 July 2012, Artemis Matthaiopoulos, a member of Golden Dawn, was elected as MP for the town of Serres. The website left.gr (associated with Syriza) reported that Matthaiopoulos was the frontman of the Nazi punk band \"Pogrom\" and pointed to the band's song \"Auschwitz\" with antisemitic lyrics such as \"fuck Anne Frank\" and \"Juden raus\" (\"Jews out\").\n\nIlias Kasidiaris quoted the book \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" in a speech to parliament on 23 October 2012. Defending himself in a discussion on whether to lift his parliamentary immunity over his assault of Kanelli, he quoted Protocol 19: \"In order to destroy the prestige of heroism we shall send them for trial in the category of theft, murder and every kind of abominable and filthy crime.\" Moreover, Kasidiaris bears a swastika tattoo on his left arm. Golden Dawn's leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, denied the existence of gas chambers and ovens at Nazi extermination camps. On 6 June 2013, the Golden Dawn MP Ilias Kasidiaris implied during a stormy debate in the Greek Parliament that he is a Holocaust denier.\n\nIn April 2014, Golden Dawn MP Ilias Panagiotaros described Hitler as a \"great personality, like Stalin\" and denounced homosexuality as a \"sickness\". Panagiotaros also described most immigrant Muslims to Greece as, \"Jihadists; fanatic Muslims\" and claimed that he supported the concept of a one-race nation, stating, \"if you are talking about nation, it is one race\".\n\nIn December 2015, the Golden Dawn was one of the main groups to reject a bill to allow civil partnerships for same-sex couples in Greece. Party leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos stated, \"church bells should toll mournfully across the country\".\n\nNikolaos Michaloliakos supports a revival of the \"Megali Idea\", the irredentist concept that guided Greece's foreign policy until the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22:\n\nThese regions, which in the past were Greek lands, had significant Greek populations until the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s. Michaloliakos has criticized Thessaloniki mayor Yiannis Boutaris for wanting to name a street after Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who was born in the city when it was part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn January 2013, a group of Golden Dawn supporters attacked the car of Turkish consul-general Osman İlhan Şener in Komotini during an anti-Turkey protest. The party members also insulted Atatürk during the attack.\n\nGolden Dawn promoted a hardline stance on the Macedonia naming dispute, rejecting any compromise solution that would include the term \"Macedonia\" in the name of North Macedonia, on the basis that only Greek Macedonia is entitled to use the name. Mihaloliakos has also called for the \"liberation\" of Northern Epirus, which is today part of southern Albania, has a Greek minority and is claimed by Greek irredentists. Golden Dawn and its Cypriot counterpart ELAM support \"enosis\", the union of Cyprus with Greece.\n\nElection advertisements for Golden Dawn have depicted the burning of US and Israeli flags, a reflection of the party's strong anti-American and anti-Zionist position. However, in June 2018, the party's MEPs voted in favour of increased security coordination with Israel. Golden Dawn is also staunchly eurosceptic, opposing Greece's participation in the European Union and the eurozone.\n\nGolden Dawn has spoken out in favor of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad following the Syrian Civil War.\n\nGolden Dawn aims to expand globally, with its spokesman saying in 2013 that the party planned to establish cells \"wherever there are Greeks.\" Since 2012, the party has opened branches in Germany, Canada (Montreal), and the United States (primarily Astoria, Queens and Tarpon Springs, Florida), and has also aimed to establish a presence in Melbourne, Australia. Leaders among the Greek diaspora and Greek Orthodox Church have denounced the group's ideology; they say only a tiny portion of Greeks abroad support the group. In 2012, a branch in Italy called \"Alba Dorata\" (\"Golden Dawn\" in Italian) was formed in Trieste.\n\n\n"}

Since then, the term has been adopted by the hospitality industry for global use.\n\nIn 1923, gambling was briefly legalized in the then-British colony of Singapore, but the experiment led to gambling addiction and increased crime, and gambling was criminalised again within three years.\n\nIn the following decades, the operation of legal gambling in Singapore was limited to the government-run Singapore Pools for lotteries, and Singapore Turf Club for horse racing. However, during a parliament session on 18 April 2005, Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore, announced the cabinet's decision to develop two casinos and associated hotels and malls in Marina South and Sentosa.\n\nThe government stated that the aim of the project was to boost Singapore's tourism industry which had been facing intense competition from other destinations around the region, particularly from nearby Bangkok and Hong Kong, which has since also considered legalisation of casinos in the wake of initiatives in Singapore. Even closer to home, Malaysia has long had a legal casino cum theme park on Genting Highlands, which proved popular with Singaporean tourists. The IRs in Singapore were expected to create about 35,000 jobs directly and indirectly. In addition to the casinos, the IRs will have other amenities including hotels, restaurants, shopping and convention centers, theatres, museums and theme parks. The industry was expected to invest US$7.1 billion in integrated resorts (US$3.5 billion in Marina Bay; US$3.6 billion in Resorts World).\n\nThe plan to build the integrated resorts was subject to considerable debate among Singaporeans even till 2014. Several groups, such as those belonging to the Muslim and Christian communities as well as social workers, openly expressed their disapproval of the casinos. Concerns were raised about the negative social impact of casino gambling, citing worries that the casinos could encourage more gambling and increase the risk of compulsive gambling. Activist groups argued that a casino could also lead to undesirable activities often associated with gambling, including money laundering, loan sharks or even organised crime.\n\nLee acknowledged the downsides of having integrated resorts and the concerns expressed by the public. He promised that there would be safeguards to limit the social impact of casino gambling. He stated there would be restrictions on the admission of local people into the casinos, for example, family members of a patron of the casino may block him or her from entering and gambling. Lee announced a steep entrance fee of S$100 per entry or S$2,000 per year and a system of exclusions for all Singaporeans. (Increased to $150 per entry or $3,000 per year on 4 April 2019) In addition, the casinos would not be allowed to extend credit to the local population.\n\nLee, who has been prime minister since August 2004, took a significant political risk when he made the decision, with some of his cabinet members against the plan. Nonetheless, Lee decided to go ahead with the decision; he stated:\n\nThe six-month consultative period gave the opportunity for many sections of the population to voice their opposition to the casinos, including a petition that attracted tens of thousands of signatures. When Lee approved the proposal after such widespread criticism, the opposition said that he had overruled consensus.\n\nThe debate over integrated resorts also brought to the public's attention a discussion on the methods and ways government policies should be deliberated in Singapore, and whether they were effective or needed reform. This is especially because the political climate is dominated by the People's Action Party. Low Thia Khiang, the leader of the opposition Workers' Party, warned in a parliament session:\n\nBy the time of the 2006 general elections, however, the decision was already a \"fait accompli\", and the opposition parties made little mention of it. The issue of casinos in Singapore was brought up by parliamentary members such as Denise Phua suggesting that the place of gambling in Singapore be reviewed till putting in a total ban on remote gambling after the Remote Gambling Bill was passed.\n\nIn December 2004, the government of Singapore called for a request-for-concept (RFC), inviting industry players to submit concept proposals for the integrated resorts. A total of 19 bids were submitted during the RFC.\n\nFour companies/consortia placed formal bids for the Marina Bay site:\n\nWhile Harrah's and MGM were considered forerunners, Las Vegas Sands emerged as the surprise winner when it was announced on 26 May 2006. Las Vegas Sands had committed the highest development investment of S$3.85 billion. With the land price and associated capital cost, its total investment will exceed S$5 billion.\nIt would also be one of the most expensive casinos in the world. The design by Moshe Safdie consists of three large shells containing conference halls and other business venues, three large hotel towers linked on their top floors by a sweeping sky garden, and a centerpiece museum which juts out onto the bay.\n\nMarina Bay Sands officially launched the opening of its first phase developments on 27 April 2010 and held its official grand opening celebrations on 23 June 2010. It is billed as a centrepiece of the Marina Bay landscape. Amenities include a hotel with 2,560 rooms and suites, Sands Expo and Convention Center with dining and shopping facilities, and the Sands SkyPark at Level 57 of the hotel, which features a 150 metre long infinity-edge swimming pool. The Expo and Convention Center served as the main media center for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games 2010 held in Singapore in August 2010. Other facilities such as museums, theatres and crystal pavilions are due to open over the year through till 2011.\n\nThree consortia submitted their proposals by the due date on 10 October 2006, including:\n\nA fourth contender, a Harrah's Entertainment and Keppel Land consortium, pulled out from the race four days before the deadline.\n\nThe bids were reviewed by a ministerial committee and a tender evaluation committee. The ministerial committee was headed by Deputy Prime Minister Prof S Jayakumar and included Tharman Shanmugaratnam, S Iswaran, Mah Bow Tan, Lim Hng Kiang, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Raymond Lim as its members.\n\nResults were announced on 8 December 2006. The winning consortium was front-runner Genting International and Star Cruises with their bid for the Resorts World Sentosa.\n\nIn August 2018, the Queensland government is set to invite investors to register their interest in developing an Integrated Resort Development in the Gold Coast. This comes after a proposed development on the Gold Coast Spit was ended on 1 August 2017.\n\nThe City of Dreams Mediterranean, developed by the Integrated Casino Resorts Cyprus Consortium, will be the first integrated resort on Cyprus. It is expected to launch in 2021.\n\nOn 20 July 2018, the Japanese Diet passed a bill allowing the establishment of casinos in three Japanese cities. Under the Integrated Resort Implementation Law, \"the casinos will be embedded in family-friendly resorts, partly in a bid to counter their seedy image\"; customers are limited to three visits a week; and locals will have to pay an entrance charge of ¥6000, while foreigners can enter for free. The bill \"clearly takes a leaf from Singapore's book\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1938047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938047", "title": "Victoria Street, Melbourne", "text": "Victoria Street, Melbourne\n\nVictoria Street is one of the major thoroughfares of inner Melbourne, running east–west for over six kilometres between Munster Terrace in North Melbourne and the Yarra River. The road is known as Victoria Parade for over one-and-a-half kilometres of its length (between the prominent intersections of Spring Street and Hoddle Street), distinguishable with a wide reservation and tramway down the middle.\n\nVictoria Street touches the north-east corner of the Hoddle Grid at the intersection of La Trobe Street and Spring Street, opposite the Carlton Gardens. After crossing the Yarra river over Victoria Bridge the street continues as Barkers Road.\n\nThe road is well known for being an arterial road for cross-city traffic and for featuring the Queen Victoria Market, Victoria Parade hospital precinct and Melbourne's Little Saigon.\n\nVictoria Street forms a part of the borders of several inner Melbourne suburbs, including West Melbourne, North Melbourne, Melbourne, Carlton, East Melbourne, Fitzroy, Collingwood, Richmond and Abbotsford.\n\nIn addition to the Carlton Gardens, several other Melbourne landmarks are located on Victoria Street, including RMIT University, the Royal Exhibition Building, St Vincent's Hospital, Queen Victoria Market, the Eastern Hill Fire Station, the Victorian Trades Hall, and Victoria Gardens Shopping Centre.\n\nThe Richmond and Abbotsford stretch of Victoria Street is amongst Melbourne's most well known restaurant strips, hosting many Vietnamese eateries and grocery stores. Before its relocation to Westgarth, the Valhalla Cinema was also located in Victoria Street, Richmond.\n\nVictoria Street was reserved as a government road in 1839. The road was originally called Simpson's Road after a magistrate who constructed a small footpath and road in 1843. The street was renamed Victoria Street in the 1850s in honour of Queen Victoria's popularity and her namesake colony. Though not part of the original Hoddle Grid, it was included as a thoroughfare in Hoddle's Mile extension.\n\nThe street originally formed the boundary between the former cities (now suburbs) of Collingwood and Richmond, and as such did not feature many grand or civic buildings, though it does now feature numerous properties on the Victorian Heritage Register. The western end of the street became a shopping centre for present-day Abbotsford and North Richmond in the 19th century, lined by predominantly double-storey terrace shops. The eastern end of the street was an industrial area comprising engineering factories and wool scouring industry.\n\nDuring the economic boom in the 1880s many of the buildings along Victoria Street were reconstructed and in 1884, the bridge over the Yarra River was built. This stimulated the subdivision of land at the end of Victoria Street and made it more easily accessible than by using the former ferry service between the river banks. In 1886 a cable car tram line was installed at the eastern end of the street. This was subsequently converted into an electric tramway in 1929.\n\nDuring the middle of the 20th century the importance of the street declined, however the area has been revitalised in more recent years as the shopping and community focus for some of Melbourne's South-East Asian migrants.\n\nThe eastern stretch of Victoria Street (between Hoddle and Burnley Streets) is known colloquially as 'Little Saigon' or 'Little Vietnam'. This is due to the influx of migrants to the surrounding area following the Vietnam War, and the subsequent development of Vietnamese businesses during the 1980s. This stretch of Victoria Street has become famous as an Asian grocery and restaurant precinct with Japanese, Korean and Thai options alongside the longer-standing Vietnamese establishments.\n\nOn 16 January 2014, a culturally-themed gateway was installed at the intersection of Victoria Street and Hoddle Street to recognise \"the cultural contributions that have established Victoria Street's reputation as a bustling and diverse retail and dining strip.\"\n\nA Lunar Festival celebrating Tết, the Vietnamese New Year festival of the Lunar calendar, has been held in the Little Saigon stretch of Victoria Street since 1994. The street is closed to traffic and many food and culture stalls, live performances and events line the section of road between Hoddle Street and Church Street.\n\nVictoria Street is serviced extensively by public transport, with St Vincent's Plaza acting as an interchange stop for most tram and bus routes that run along the street. Several tram routes run along portions of Victoria Street and Victoria Parade's length, including the 11, 12, 57 and 109.\n\nBus routes connecting Melbourne City Centre to its Eastern suburbs also run along Victoria Parade for parts of their journeys, primarily between Spring Street and Hoddle Street. Bus route 402 to Footscray also terminates on Victoria St at the Carlton Gardens.\n\nNorth Richmond railway station lies on Victoria Street in the Eastern Suburb of Richmond at the corner of Regent Street. It is close by the Hoddle Street intersection, Little Saigon and a connected tram stop. Though no other railway stations are located on Victoria Street itself, North Melbourne railway station is near its western end.\n\n"}

She was referred to as one of the world's first women tiger trainers/tamers. In its belated obituary, \"The New York Times\" lauded Stark as \"one of the most celebrated animal trainers in a field dominated by men.\"\n\nStark was born on December 9, 1888 (or 1889) in Smith County, Tennessee. The family later relocated to Cobb near Princeton, Kentucky, where her mother's parents were located. She was one of seven children born to Lela and Hardy Haynie.\n\nStark's parents were farmers, and they died within two years of each other, so that by the age of 17, Stark and her siblings were orphaned. She spent a short period of time with her aunt Kate Pettypoole in Princeton. She then traveled to Louisville and became a nurse at St. Mary's Hospital. Soon after, she left Louisville, and her history becomes difficult to trace.\n\nCircus friends contend that she worked in carnivals as a \"dancer\" of some type. (Like many circus performers, Stark did not hesitate to enrich the truth to create an interesting story. She even once told an interviewer that she was born to a wealthy Canadian.)\n\nShe ended up in 1911 with the Al G. Barnes Circus based in Culver City, California, where she met animal trainer Al Sands. She worked for a brief time there as a \"high school\" rider (horseback rider) but fervently wanted to work with the big cats. She began work with Louis Roth, a famous \"cat man\" she would later marry. (Stark was married four or five times.)\n\nSoon, she became a tiger trainer in the ring. At first, they had her work a \"balloon act\", which had her \"riding\" a lion on a platform and then pressing a pedal to release fireworks at some point in the act. But by 1916, she was presenting the show's major tiger act.\n\nOn February 18, 1916, Stark was severely mauled by a lion named Louie while rehearsing for the Pacific Electric exhibit of the National Orange Show in San Bernardino, California. Stark's husband, Louis Roth, fired blank cartridges from a revolver into the face of the lion amid the screams of his wife and spectators who had gathered to watch the rehearsal. The lion seized Stark's left arm into its mouth and rolled over a number of times. (Roth had also been mauled earlier that day by a lion named Jeff. He suffered deep injuries to his arm before firing blanks into the animal's open jaws.)\n\nStark was dragged unconscious from the cage and rushed to a hospital where she was treated for a mangled and broken arm. This was Stark's third mauling in as many years. In 1914, while in Detroit, Michigan, she was attacked by her leopards during a parade, and during the winter of 1915, she was mangled in Venice, California.\n\nShe adopted a mangy, sickly tiger cub named Rajah and raised him to perform a famous wrestling act with her. She accomplished this by romping and playing with the cub at the beach and actually keeping him as a pet in her apartment. According to Stark's autobiography, \"Rajah would run straight toward me. Up he went on his hind legs, his forefeet around my neck. We turned around once or twice, I threw him to the ground, and we rolled three or four times. I opened his mouth and put my face inside, then jumped to my feet\".\n\nIn 1922, she was asked to join the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus where she performed in Madison Square Garden with tigers and a black panther. By the end of that season, of the six wild animal acts featured with the circus, Stark's was clearly the greatest success. In 1923, she starred in the Ringling center ring, but two years later in 1925, the circus banned all wild animal acts.\n\nAfter a sojourn to Europe where she performed in a circus, she came back to the US in 1928 and began work with the John Robinson Show. In Bangor, Maine, she lost her footing in a muddy arena and was seriously mauled by her tigers. She suffered a wound that almost severed her leg, face lacerations, a hole in her shoulder, a torn deltoid, and a host of other injuries. She was rescued by fellow trainer Terrell Jacobs and returned to the ring in a matter of weeks, swathed in bandages and walking with a cane. She suffered numerous maulings and serious injuries over her nearly 60 years of working with tigers. At one point in her career, she would face 18 big cats in the ring.\n\nShe performed with the Sells-Floto Circus in 1929 and then rejoined Barnes after it had been sold to Ringling in 1930. She stayed there until it was absorbed into Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey during the season of 1938. In 1932, she and her tiger act was filmed for the Paramount Pictures motion picture \"King of the Jungle\". In the film, Stark is seen putting her tigers through their paces when fire erupts in the big top. She toured with small circuses and lived in Japan where she performed her circus act in the '50s.\n\nShe returned to California and finished her career at the Jungle Compound (later called Jungleland) in Thousand Oaks. Stark appeared occasionally on television in the 1960s. For example, she did a stint as one of the guests with an unusual occupation on \"What's My Line?\", the popular Sunday night CBS-TV program.\n\nIn 1968, Jungleland was sold to a new owner who disliked Stark and fired her. Soon after she left, one of her tigers escaped and was shot. Stark was angry and hurt about the animal's destruction, and felt that she could have safely secured the tiger if the owners had asked for her assistance.\n\nThree months later, she killed herself by an overdose of barbiturates. In the last pages of her autobiography, \"Hold That Tiger\", Stark writes: \"The chute door opens as I crack my whip and shout, 'Let them come,' Out slink the striped cats, snarling and roaring, leaping at each other or at me. It's a matchless thrill, and life without it is not worth while to me.\"\n\nShe died on April 20, 1968.\n\nIn 2001, a fictionalized biography of Stark's life by author Robert Hough titled \"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark\" was published. The story is based in 1968, the same year that Stark committed suicide. It is a fictionalized account of the events of her life. The screenplay was optioned by director Sam Mendes with the hopes of making a film starring his wife Kate Winslet; however, no production schedule has been announced.

He served as king consort of Naples, as such being excluded from government.\n\nBorn around 1336, James was the son of King James III of Majorca and Constance of Aragon. The Kingdom of Majorca came into being when James the Conqueror, King of Aragon, died on 27 June 1276. He distributed his realms between his two sons, leaving his elder son, Peter III, with Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia, and his younger son, James II, with the Balearic Islands, Montpellier, Roussillon and Cerdanya.\n\nPeter III of Aragon and his successors made several attempts to re-unite the lands of the Crown of Aragon under their rule. Peter III demanded an oath of fealty from his brother in 1280; Peter III's elder son, Alfonso III of Aragon, occupied the Balearic Islands in 1287. Alfonso III's brother and successor, James II of Aragon, restored the islands to his uncle in the Treaty of Anagni in 1295, but James II of Majorca had to acknowledge his nephew's suzerainty. In 1324, James II of Aragon confirmed the right of James II of Mallorca's grandson, James III of Majorca (James IV's father), to inherit the Kingdom of Mallorca after lengthy negotiations. James III married the sister of Peter IV of Aragon, but their relationship was tense, because James III avoided to do homage to his brother-in-law for years. Peter IV declared James III a disobedient vassal and occupied the Balearic Islands, Roussillon and Cerdanya in May 1344.\n\nJames III went to Avignon in early 1348 to secure Pope Clement VI's support against Peter IV. James accompanied his father. Scholar Nancy Goldstone proposes that James most probably met with his future wife, Joanna I of Naples, who had come to Avignon to stand trial for her alleged involvement in the murder of her first husband, Andrew. She answered the charges that Andrew's brother, Louis I of Hungary, had brought against her and the Pope declared her innocent in March 1348. James III supported Joanna I during the trial and she promised to lend the Neapolitan fleet to him to invade the Balearic Islands. James III had to sell his last domain, Montpellier, to France to raise funds before launching the invasion in 1349. His army was routed and he was killed in the Battle of Llucmajor on 25 October 1349.\n\nHis father was killed at the Battle of Llucmajor in 1349 while attempting to recapture his kingdom, and James IV was taken prisoner by his uncle, Peter IV of Aragon. Now pretender to the Kingdom of Majorca and the Principality of Achaea, James was kept in an iron cage in Barcelona until 1362. He then contrived to escape and take refuge with Joanna I of Naples, who had aided his father's last attempt on Majorca.\n\nJoanna was then childless, and in need of an heir: she married James on September 26, 1363, at Castel Nuovo. Perhaps to avoid the civil strife of Joanna's first two marriages, James was carefully excluded from government of his wife's realm by the marriage contract. However, the marriage proved unsuccessful. The couple had no children, and rarely saw each other.\n\nJames was determined to recapture his kingdom, and soon departed to make war on the Kingdom of Aragon. He was defeated and forced to flee to Bordeaux. There he gained the support of Edward the Black Prince, who he hoped would restore him to Majorca after restoring Peter the Cruel in Castile. He joined the invasion of Castile, taking part in the battle of Nájera (3 April 1367). He was stricken with a long and severe illness in Valladolid. Unable to ride, he could not leave the city and was captured by Henry II of Castile. Ransomed by Joanna, he returned to Naples only briefly before setting off again.\n\nHenry had launched a war against Peter IV of Aragon, and James hoped to take advantage of this to capture Roussillon and Cerdanya, the mainland portions of his father's realm. However, John of Gaunt procured a truce between Castile and Aragon, and the full weight of the Aragonese forces fell upon James. Defeated again, he fled into Castile, where he died of illness or poison at Soria on 20 January 1375, the 32nd anniversary of his wife's accession.\n\nHis pretensions to Majorca passed to his sister Isabella, wife of John II of Montferrat. He willed his rights to Achaea to Joanna, who had ruled the remains of the Principality since 1373 by cession of her brother-in-law, Philip II of Taranto.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

His penchant for not crashing and consistently finishing in the points earned him the nickname \"Steady Eddie\".\n\nBorn in Upland, California, Lawson began his motorcycle racing career in the Southern California dirt track circuit. When it became increasingly difficult to find machinery able to compete with the dominant Harley-Davidsons, he switched his attention to road racing. In 1979, Lawson finished the season second behind Freddie Spencer in the AMA 250cc road racing National Championship. Afterwards, he was offered a ride with the Kawasaki Superbike team and won the AMA Superbike Series in 1981 and 1982. He also won the AMA 250cc road racing National Championship in 1980 and 1981 for Kawasaki.\n\nLawson accepted an offer from Yamaha to contest the 500cc World Championship as Kenny Roberts' teammate for the 1983 season. Lawson spent the 1983 season learning the ropes of the Grand Prix circuit. In 1984, Lawson began winning regularly and won the 1984 World Championship. It would mark the first of four world titles Lawson would go on to win. In 1985, he won the prestigious Imola 200 pre-season race. After winning two more titles for Yamaha in 1986 and 1988, Lawson shocked the racing world by announcing he would be leaving Yamaha to sign with their arch-rivals Rothmans Honda as teammate to his own archrival, Australia's 1987 World Champion Wayne Gardner. By switching teams, Lawson also fulfilled his desire to work with Erv Kanemoto. After Gardner crashed and broke his leg during the third round at Laguna Seca, Lawson went on to win the 1989 title for Honda, becoming the first rider to win back-to-back championships on machines from different manufacturers. By winning with both Yamaha and Honda, Lawson silenced his critics who believed he would not be as successful away from the factory Marlboro Yamaha team.\n\nLawson also won the ABC Superbikers event at Carlsbad Calif. in 1983 and 1985 which pitted the best riders from several disciplines against each other on a combined dirt and paved course. He was riding a specially equipped factory YZ 490 Yamaha.\n\nIn 1990, Lawson won the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race on a Yamaha FZR750R paired with teammate Tadahiko Taira. Lawson also won the Daytona 200 in 1986 and came out of retirement to win it again in 1993. When he retired from Grand Prix racing in the early 1990s, he ranked third on the all-time MotoGP class (then known as 500GP) Grand Prix wins list with 31.\n\nAfter finishing his motorcycle career, Lawson pursued a career in open-wheel single seater racing in the United States competing in the Indy Lights series and eventually to CART. In the 1996 IndyCar season, he competed in 11 races with his best results being two sixth-place finishes at U.S. 500 and the Detroit Indy Grand Prix. His passion for speed remains undiminished and the former World Champion now enjoys driving 250cc Superkarts often accompanied by his great friend and rival Wayne Rainey, who races in a specially modified Superkart to cope with his spinal injuries, and historic Formula One cars, with a Walter Wolf Racing WR4 at vintage events.\n\n\nPoints system from 1969 to 1987:\n\nPoints system from 1988 to 1992:\n\n"}
{"id": "1938083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938083", "title": "Squawk Box", "text": "Squawk Box\n\nSquawk Box is an American business news television program that airs from 6 to 9 a.m. Eastern time on CNBC. The program is co-hosted by Joe Kernen, Becky Quick, and Andrew Ross Sorkin. Since debuting in 1995, the show has spawned a number of versions across CNBC's international channels, many of which employ a similar format. The program title originates from a term used in investment banks and stock brokerages for a permanent voice circuit or intercom used to communicate stock deals or sales priorities; it also may refer to the squawk of a bird, like a peacock, which is the logo of CNBC.\n\nDubbed \"our pre-game show\" by regular co-host Joe Kernen, \"Squawk Box\" features early-morning analysis of and breaking news from the financial markets, along with considerable banter between the hosts and their guests – original host Mark Haines stressed the need to \"inject a little fun\" into business news in the early morning. Another distinctive and long-running feature of the show has been its use of daily \"guest hosts\" – figures from the world of business and politics who join the team for much of the broadcast, questioning guests as well as offering their own opinions.\n\nRegular contributors to the show include Sharon Epperson (NYMEX), Rick Santelli (Chicago), Steve Liesman, Guy Adami and CNBC senior analyst Ron Insana.\n\nMeteorologists from The Weather Channel contribute to the \"Business Travel Forecast\" segments.\n\n\"Squawk Box\"’s core on-air team remained intact for many years – the program was originally presented by New Jersey lawyer Mark Haines, along with in-studio reporters Joe Kernen, David Faber and Maria Bartiromo at the New York Stock Exchange. CNBC's senior economics reporter Steve Liesman also became a frequent contributor. Alexis Glick joined the team as senior trading correspondent in May 2003, while Bartiromo stepped down from her position in 2004 to concentrate on other duties. Rebecca Quick later replaced Glick as a reporter.\n\nFor many years the program covered the opening bells of the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ Stock Market at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Other regular segments included the \"Squawk Exchange\", where the team (particularly Faber and Kernen) shared banter on various topics, \"On the Box\" (rapid-fire summaries of the day's headlines) and \"Joe's World\", where Kernen sounded off on the day's notable stock stories.\n\nDuring the period when CNBC's online presence was housed at MSN Money, the show held its own daily \"Squawk Back Poll\" on the website, where viewers voted on a topical issue. In May 2005 the program established its own blog on Windows Live Spaces, called \"SquawkBlog\", where the program hosts posted their thoughts, although this is no longer in use.\n\nThe program underwent a significant revamp on December 19, 2005, with the show moving to the 6:00 am ET timeslot and Kernen, Quick and Carl Quintanilla helming a new tri-anchor format alongside on-air editor Charles Gasparino. Haines and Faber moved to a newly created program, \"Squawk on the Street\", anchored from the NYSE by Haines and Erin Burnett with Faber at CNBC headquarters. As a result of these changes, coverage of the market open at 9:30am ET passed to \"Squawk on the Street\". The \"guest host\" feature of \"Squawk Box\" was dropped immediately after the revamp but later reinstated.\n\nThere was a significant amount of initial negative feedback about the changes made to \"Squawk\", most notably the removal of Mark Haines from the team. On the \"Squawk Box\" blog, over 200 complaints were entered into the site, along with numerous messages posted on the CNBC message board.\n\nOn July 8, 2011, Quintanilla left \"Squawk Box\" to become part of the new \"Squawk on the Street\" anchor team, following Haines' death on May 24 of that year. His new assignment began three days later, when he debuted with Melissa Lee and Simon Hobbs. Andrew Ross Sorkin of \"The New York Times\", joined Kernen and Quick in order to succeed Quintanilla's anchoring duties. Sorkin made his debut as co-anchor July 18, 2011.\n\nOn October 13, 2014, \"Squawk Box\", along with CNBC's other trading-day shows, were launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of a network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation on that same day.\n\nOn January 7, 2015, \"Squawk Box\" moved to a new street-side studio inside the Time-Life Building in New York City after almost two decades in New Jersey (at CNBC's original facilities in Fort Lee from its August 7, 1995, debut to October 10, 2003, and at CNBC's facilities in Englewood Cliffs from October 13, 2003, to January 6, 2015).\n\nOn January 4, 2016, \"Squawk Box\" debuted a remastered version of its logo used since October 13, 2014. On February 8, 2016, both the Asian and European versions also started using the remastered \"Squawk Box\" logo.\n\nOn November 14, 2016, it was officially announced by the NASDAQ that production of \"Squawk Box\" would be relocated to the NASDAQ MarketSite studio in Times Square; it began broadcasting from there on January 3, 2017. That same studio is also shared with CNBC's two other shows, \"Fast Money\" and \"Options Action\" (the latter airing on Fridays only; both shows are hosted by Melissa Lee).\n\nOn November 15, 2017, \"Squawk Box\" moved downstairs to a new street-level studio overlooking Times Square, also at the NASDAQ MarketSite.\n\nOn October 30, 2019, \"Squawk Box\" renovated its set at the NASDAQ MarketSite. The curved desk was replaced with a round anchor desk, a setup similar to the one the show had used when it aired from CNBC's Englewood Cliffs studios. New graphics and music were also introduced.\n\nThe program airs from 6 a.m. until 9 a.m. Eastern Time in the United States.\n\nIt is relayed in its entirety live on CNBC Europe although it is sometimes partially pre-empted for local programming, particularly to cover European Central Bank interest rate announcements and the subsequent press conferences.\n\nIn Asia, the show is aired in its entirety on CNBC Asia from Mondays to Fridays (vary between time to time during U.S. Daylight Saving Time and Standard Time). Also, it can be air in New Zealand from Tuesdays to Saturdays during Daylight Saving Time when U.S. is on Eastern Standard Time.\n\nCNBC once aired Squawk Box Weekend Edition weekends from 7:30 to 8 pm ET during c. 1999 to 2000, also hosted by Mark Haines.\n\nAround CNBC's global branches, there are many \"Squawk Boxes\" in the world:\nAmong the above, Squawk Box Europe and Asia Squawk Box are the counterparts which resemble the original Squawk Box the most:\n\n\n(Karen Tso moved to the Asian version of \"Squawk Box\" (and was based in Singapore) and after Amanda Drury briefly replaced Tso on \"Squawk Australia\", Oriel Morrison moved into that role in 2010 while Drury is now based in CNBC World Headquarters in the U.S.). Tso moved to the European version of \"Squawk Box\" after joining CNBC Europe in 2011.\n\n150,221 players participated in the \"Squawk Box Fantasy Portfolio Challenge\", a stock-picking contest that ran from April 4, 2006 through May 26, 2006. The winner of the \"Squawk Box Fantasy Portfolio Challenge\", which was announced live at the end of the 2 June 2006 episode, was Thomas Ko of California.

{"id": "1938112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938112", "title": "Piankh", "text": "Piankh\n\nPiankh was a High Priest of Amun during the 21st Dynasty.\n\nWhile the High Priest of Amun Piankh (or Payankh) has been assumed to be a son-in-law of Herihor and his heir to the Theban office of the High Priest of Amun, recent studies by Karl Jansen-Winkeln of the surviving temple inscriptions and monumental works by Herihor and Piankh in Upper Egypt imply that Piankh was actually Herihor's predecessor.\n\nPiankh held a number of official positions including High Priest of Amun, King's scribe, King's son of Kush, Overseer of the foreign countries to the South, overseer of the granaries and commander of the archers of the whole of [Upper] Egypt. He was succeeded in office by either Herihor or his son Pinedjem.\n\nThe identity of Piankh's wife has not been established beyond doubt. In the Temple of Luxor there is a graffito of which only rudimentary traces of the beginning of her name have survived. These have been interpreted as either an \"h\" (Gardiner's Sign List V28, supporting Hrere) or as \"ndjm\" (Gardiner's Sign List M29). The latter solution would favour a model in which Piankh was married to a lady Nodjmet. Recently it has been argued that there were actually two ladies called Nodjmet: the first one, Nodjmet A, the wife of Piankh and mother of Herihor; the second one, Nodjmet B, the wife of Herihor. \nWhereas the identity of his wife remains uncertain, it is beyond doubt that he had a son called Pinedjem.\n\nIn year 10 of the Whm Mswt Piankh, in his position as Viceroy of Kush, led an army into Nubia with the apparent aim to 'meet' a certain Pinehesy, probably the former Viceroy of Kush. Some ten years earlier, just before the start of the Whm mswt, Pinehesy had been chased out of the Thebaid, following his role in suppressing the High Priest of Amun Amenhotep. It is believed that since then he lived in Nubia as an enemy of the state. Although it is often postulated that it was the aim of this expedition to fight Pinehesy, this is by no means certain.\n\nThe sources are actually ambiguous on this point and the political climate may well have changed over the years. There is some evidence that at this time Piankh may no longer have been a loyal servant of Ramesses XI, which allows for the possibility that he was secretly negotiating with Pinehesy, possibly even plotting against the reigning king.\n\nE. Wente wrote: \"One has the impression that the viceroy and his Nubian troops were loyalists, for the remarks made by his opponent Piankh in letter No. 301 are quite disparaging of the pharaoh, Ramesses XI.\" In this letter, better known as LRL no. 21, Piankh remarks: \n\nIn the same letter and two others (LRL no. 34 and no. 35) Piankh gives the order to the Scribe of the Necropolis Tjaroy (=Dhutmose), Nodjmet and a certain Payshuuben to secretly arrest and question two Medjay policemen about certain things they had apparently said:\nIt has been argued that, given Piankh's prominent position at the time, the secrecy can only have concerned the king. If this is correct, it follows that the political situation of the time must have been very complex. Unfortunately, due to the very limited nature of the sources, the exact relationships between the three main protagonists, Piankh, Pinehesy and Ramesses XI remain far from clear. Some scholars believe that the Nubian campaign was part of an ongoing power struggle between the High Priest of Amun and the Viceroy of Kush. However, it is equally possible that Piankh came to the rescue of Pinehesy against some common enemy. The verb often translated as \"to attack\" only means \"to meet/ to go to\". In fact, neither the aim of the expedition nor its outcome are beyond doubt. It has also been argued that shortly afterwards Piankh disappeared off the stage with the Viceroy Pinehesy being reinvested in his former position as Viceroy, which would only be possible with the consent of Ramesses XI, either willingly or not.\n\nIt seems that, under Piankh's pontificate, a beginning was made with locating and opening old tombs, either with the aim of protecting them against tomb violation or in order to use their buried treasures to finance affairs of the state. Eventually the priests of Amun scoured the valleys to find tombs; tombs and mummies were stripped of valuables, rewrapped and placed in group graves (caches).\n\n"}

In fact, Langley is often credited as being the \"Godfather of Reality Television\" with the appearance of \"COPS\" in 1989.\n\nLangley was born in Oklahoma City but moved to Los Angeles as a small child. Langley worked the intelligence unit of the United States Army from 1961 to 1963 and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from California State University, Dominguez Hills in 1971 and later a master's degree in literature and composition.\n\nLangley briefly participated in the doctorate of philosophy program in University of California, Irvine.\n\nOn December 2, 1986, Langley made his entrance into the world of reality television when a show which he produced, \"American Vice: The Doping of a Nation\", showed three live drug arrests on primetime television for the first time. In order to make the show Langley had convinced officials of the Broward County, Florida Sheriff's Department to allow cameras to accompany them on a previously-scheduled drug bust. The success of the show proved to be the grand inspiration for Langley's signature work.\n\nIn 1989, Langley left The Hooley Dooleys and with Malcolm Barbour serving as his production partner, formed \"Barbour/Langley Productions\".\n\nLangley's most notable achievement perhaps is the innovation of the \"cinéma vérité\" signature style of the award-winning \"Cops\" television program, which notably influenced TV advertising and news reporting, not to mention other network and syndicated programming.\n\nLangley recalls that the \"Cops\" concept was initially difficult to sell to television network executives, and that all were \"very negative\" to his fundamental idea. He was finally able to win a meeting with Barry Diller, then head of Fox Broadcasting Company to explain his concept, he recalled in a 2013 interview:\n\n'You've gotta have a narrator,' Diller said. And I said no. 'Whattayamean no?' Diller said. And I said that defies the whole purpose of doing it the way I'm talking about doing it. 'All right then,' Diller said. 'You gotta do some reenactments.' And I said no. 'Whattayamean no?' And I kept doing this with him because my feeling was I'm not gonna sell out my idea anymore. To hell with 'em all.\n\nUltimately a pilot episode was ordered, which garnered mix reviews among Fox executives owing to the overly graphic nature of a murder scene which was featured. After viewing the pilot, a group of Executives began to debate the future of the show inside network headquarters with Langley in attendance. Langley later recalled:\n\nAnd this guy came in the room and sat in the corner. He looked like an accountant. [After further debate] the guy in the corner says, 'Order four of them. Try four [episodes].' And I look over and Diller says, 'Ah, you hush, I'm talking right now.' And I thought, 'Well, who's that guy, the accountant?' Well, obviously, it turned out that he wasn't the accountant. It was Rupert Murdoch, but [in those days] nobody knew who Rupert Murdoch was or what he looked like.\n\n\"Cops\" left Fox in 2011, and was picked up by what was then Spike, which is now the Paramount Network. The show is airing in its 32nd season on Paramount Network while continuing its national run on syndicated and cable TV, thus becoming one of the longest running reality series in television history. The show has broken records for primetime network television with over 1000 episodes aired (as of 2017).\n\nIn 1992, Barbour/Langley Productions moved to a new location in Orlando, Florida. Barbour retired in 1994 and the production company became simply Langley Productions.\n\nAmong Langley's credits are \"Who Murdered JFK\", an examination of the John F. Kennedy assassination; and \"Terrorism: Target U.S.A.\", an early warning of the coming problems with terrorism in the United States as well as across the world. Langley's credits also include various network, cable and syndicated TV shows, including the television series \"Code 3\", \"Anatomy of Crime\", \"Video Justice\", and \"Cop Files\".\n\nHe has also produced various independent films and directed film and documentary film, including the Dolph Lundgren workout video \"Maximum Potential\", \"Dogwatch\", \"Tiptoes\" and \"Wildside\".\n\nLangley also produced a television series called \"Inside American Jail\" for TruTV with his son Morgan. In an innovative move, the show was also sold to and airs as \"Jail\" on MyNetworkTV. \"Jail\" is also an unscripted series following corrections officers as they process suspects through city and county jails. Morgan Langley is credited as co-creator of the new series, which incorporates the video verite style of \"Cops\". Father and son then produced \"Las Vegas Jailhouse\" as yet another examination of crime and the justice system in America.\n\nLangley was a producer of Antoine Fuqua's \"Brooklyn's Finest\", which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2009.\n\nDuring the 2010/2011 television season, Langley was also responsible for the following series running concurrently: \"Cops\", \"Jail,\" \"Las Vegas Jailhouse,\" \"Street Patrol\" and \"Vegas Strip\". More recent TV shows include \"Road Warriors\" on Spike. \n\nLangley also produced \"Undercover Stings\" for Spike. \n\nLangley also started his own off-road race team known as COPS racing team. Langley is active in Southern Nevada Off Road Enthusiasts and SCORE International.\nHe won the 2017 Baja 1000 in the Spec Trophy Truck class.\nLangley has won various awards for the \"COPS\" television series, including the \"American Television Award\" and four Emmy Award nominations. Other awards include the Cine Golden Eagle and Houston International Film Festival winner for the documentary \"Cocaine Blues\". His DVDs, moreover, have won various awards for greatest sales records in the mid 1990s when he founded Real Entertainment and pioneered the reality DVD market with VHS releases of multiple reality titles like \"COPS: Too Hot for TV\" and \"The Amazing Video Collection\". The term \"Too Hot for TV\" was coined and trademarked by Langley during this period and was used in marketing until he sold the company. \n\nLangley was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 2011 for his contributions to television.\n\n"}

He represented Australia and Queensland from 1964 to 1981. His main position was at . Beetson became the first Indigenous Australian to captain Australia in any sport and is frequently cited as the best post-war forward in Australian rugby league history. He also had an extensive coaching career, spanning the 1970s to the 1990s, coaching Australia, Queensland, Eastern Suburbs, Redcliffe Dolphins and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks.\n\nHe is also remembered as man of great humility who cared deeply about his people and culture. The Arthur Beetson Foundation was so named to honour Beetson, and the Arthur Beetson Medal is awarded to rugby league players who show both outstanding skills and similar personal qualities to Beetson.\n\nBeetson's mother was a member of the Stolen Generation. He was born in Roma, Queensland on 21 January 1945.\n\nBeetson's big frame, pure speed and brilliant ball skills won countless games for all his teams. His off-loading and attacking workrate broke the mould for front rowers and changed the way they played the game.\n\nBeetson's rugby league career began with Redcliffe in the Brisbane Rugby League competition between 1964 and 1965. After winning the club's player of the year award in 1965 as well as the Brisbane Rugby League premiership with them, he moved to Sydney to play in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership with the Balmain club. The 1966 NSWRFL season was his first and he gained selection for the New South Wales team and played in that season's grand final against St. George at second-row forward. Beetson was also selected to make his representative début for Australia against England and set up the first two tries. He represented Australia again at the 1968 Rugby League World Cup, playing at prop forward in the win against France in the tournament final. Beetson then played with Balmain, with a spell in England with Hull Kingston Rovers in 1968.\n\nAfter the 1970 NSWRFL season Beetson left Balmain to join the Eastern Suburbs club where he would stay from 1971 to 1978. He possessed great strength and toughness, a surprising turn of speed for a big man and was unequalled as a ball player. Beetson continued to represent Australia at the 1972 Rugby League World Cup, playing against Great Britain at prop forward in the tournament final which was drawn. On the 1973 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France he was selected as Australia's vice captain, playing at prop forward in all three Ashes test matches. Beetson then became the first aboriginal player to captain Australia in the second test against France.\n\nHis skill as a footballer was matched only by his skill as an eater, earning nicknames such as 'Meat Pie Artie'. He was known and immortalised by his performance of eating 11 hot dogs before a gala dinner for the Australian team in 1973. Beetson captained Eastern Suburbs to the 1974 and 1975 premierships. During this period Beetson also continued playing with distinction for Australia and in 1974 he was named as \"Rugby League Week\"'s player of the year. During the 1976 NSWRFL season, Beetson captained Eastern Suburbs to victory in their unofficial 1976 World Club Challenge match against British champions St. Helens in Sydney. This Easts team would go down as one of the greatest club sides in rugby league history. Beetson joined the Parramatta Eels in 1979.\n\nWhile still playing in Sydney for Parramatta, Beetson achieved further immortality as captain of Queensland in the inaugural 1980 State of Origin game, won 20–10 by Queensland on 8 July. He capped off that year with a man of the match performance in the Eels' 8-5 Tooth Cup Final win over Balmain. Beetson returned to Queensland for one final year of playing with his old Redcliffe team in 1981. He also captained Queensland for the final 'traditional' interstate match in 1981 and at the end of the season the Dolphins were beaten in the final minute of the grand final by Southern Suburbs.\n\nBeetson's coaching career began while still playing for Easts in 1977. He was captain-coach of Redcliffe in 1981 and that season was appointed coach of the Queensland State of Origin side, taking them to repeated series victories over New South Wales from 1981 to 1984 . He had a brief, but unsuccessful period, coaching Australia in 1983 before returning to coach his former club Eastern Suburbs, from 1985 to 1988, being named Coach of the Year in 1987. Also in 1987 he received the Medal of the Order of Australia \"in recognition of service to the sport of Rugby League\".\n\nAfter stepping down as Queensland coach following the 1990 State of Origin series loss to NSW, Beetson became part of the ABC's commentary team in 1991 for their \"Saturday Afternoon League\" telecasts alongside chief caller, former Western Suburbs winger Warren Boland, as well as his former Parramatta teammate John Peard and Canterbury-Bankstown media liaison Debbie Spillane, both of whom worked on the sidelines.\n\nBeetson coached the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for the 1992 and 1993 seasons, where he enjoyed mixed success. Part-way through the 1994 NSWRL season Beetson briefly replaced the sacked Mark Murray as coach of the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. Beetson has also spent many years as a recruitment officer for both Eastern Suburbs and Queensland.\n\nIn the post-1999 NRL season an Aboriginal side managed by Arthur Beetson defeated the Papua New Guinean national team. He then pushed, unsuccessfully, for an Australia Day match against the Australian national team.\n\n\nBeetson is often regarded as Australia's best ever forward, and in 2000 he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal, then in 2001 the Centenary Medal \"for service to Australian society through the sport of rugby league\". He was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame in 2003. In May 2004 his book, \"Big Artie: The Autobiography\" was published. Also that year he became the seventh selected post-war \"Immortal\" of the Australian game with Churchill, Raper, Gasnier, Fulton, Langlands and Wally Lewis.\n\nIn February 2008, Beetson was named in a list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Beetson went on to be named in the front-row in Australian rugby league's Team of the Century. Announced on 17 April 2008, the team is the panel's majority choice for each of the thirteen starting positions and four interchange players. Beetson chose to boycott the presentation ceremony, stating that he did not agree with the direction rugby league is taking. In June 2008, he was chosen in the Queensland Rugby League's Team of the Century at second-row.\nIn 2008, rugby league in Australia's centenary year, Beetson was named at second-row forward in the Toowoomba and South West Team of the Century.\nHe was made a life member of the Sydney Cricket Ground and a plaque in the Walk of Honour there commemorates his career. He is a recipient of the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM).\n\nAs part of the Centenary of League celebrations in 2008, Beetson was retrospectively awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as \"Man of the Match\" in the 1974 Grand final.\n\nIn 2009 Beetson was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2010 a program was founded and named in honour of Arthur Beetson, the ARTIE Academy (Achieving Results Through Indigenous Education). An inspiration and role model for his people, Arthur was resolute in his beliefs about the absolute need for young Indigenous Australians to be educated, to finish school and to be employed. The ARTIE Academy operates with an innovative, high expectation, consistent and positive mindset. ARTIE is an Academy that students are proud to be a part of. An Academy that expects them to achieve to the best of their ability. An Academy that will support them in times of need, but not accept excuses for a lack of commitment. ARTIE inspires its participants, encourages and informs them of their progress and celebrates their successes. The program is run by the FOGS (Former Origin Greats) organisation and funded under the \"Closing the Gap\" initiative. The program continues to operate in schools around Queensland.\n\nBeetson's Queensland State of Origin number 11 jersey was \"retired\" in 2014.\n\nOn 1 December 2011, Beetson died following a heart attack while riding his bicycle at Paradise Point on the Gold Coast, Queensland. He was 66.\nThe Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh announced that a bronze statue of Beetson was to be situated at Lang Park. It was unveiled on 3 July 2012.\n\nThe Arthur Beetson Foundation was created to engage the community \"to empower Indigenous Australians to better outcomes in health, education, sport, employment and business development\", and the Arthur Beetson Medal honours rugby league players who have distinguished themselves who have shown not only skill on the field but some of the qualities embodied by Beetson and cares deeply about their people.\n\n\n"}

The term plays off \"British Raj\", the period of British rule in India. It was coined by Indian freedom fighter and statesman Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari, who firmly opposed it for its potential for political corruption and economic stagnation, founding the Swatantra Party to oppose these practices.\n\nThe Licence Raj was a result of the first post-Independence government's decision to have a planned economy where all aspects of the economy are controlled by the state and licences are given to a select few. Up to 80 government agencies had to be satisfied before private companies could produce something and, if granted, the government would regulate production.\n\nReforms since the mid-1980s have significantly reduced regulation, but Indian labour laws still prevent manufacturers from reducing their workforce without prohibitive burdens.\n\nIn the beginning of independent Indian society, not everyone agreed upon the setting up of a new idea and within that the systems of government. Rajagopalachari who coined the term wrote in his newspaper: \n\nThe controlled economy and in itself the Licence Raj came up prior to the creation of the Indian independent state. Formation of the licence Raj was due to the aftermath of World War 2 and the departing of the British. But ultimately, the underlying issues that were meant to be solved by the Licence Raj stemmed from colonial times. Due to the fact that resources for years had been extracted by the British East India Company and the British colonial government and ferried to Britain instead of benefiting India, it had left India with no basis for an economy post decolonization. Due to these circumstances India had to foster its economy into being. The Licence Raj and policies of Nehru's government were meant to facilitate this. The Licence Raj was seen as a control on the Indian economy. Additionally, Late Developing Countries (LDCs) have weak economies and it is vital for those countries to build up their institutions in order to have a properly functioning market. Thus making the idea of a Licence Raj in the eyes of Nehru an effective tool in the shaping of India's economy.\n\nThe architect of the system of Licence Raj was Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. Private players could manufacture goods only with official licences.\n\nThe key characteristic of the Licence Raj is a Planning Commission that centrally administers the economy of the country. Like a command economy, India had Five-Year Plans on the lines of the Five-Year Plans in the Soviet Union. Arguing that the Planning Commission has outlived its utility, Modi government disbanded it in 2014.\n\nBefore the process of reforms began in 1991, the government attempted to close the Indian economy to the outside world. The Indian currency, the rupee, was inconvertible and high tariffs and import licensing prevented foreign goods reaching the market. India also operated a system of central planning for the economy, in which firms required licences to invest and develop. This bureaucracy often led to absurd restrictions: up to 80 agencies had to be satisfied before a firm could be granted a licence to produce, and, even then, the state would decide what was produced, how much, at what price and what sources of capital were used.\n\nThe government also prevented firms from laying off workers or closing factories. The central pillar of the policy was import substitution industrialisation, the belief that countries like India needed to rely on internal markets for development, not international trade, a belief generated by a mixture of socialism and the experience during the colonial period.\n\nThe Licence Raj system was in place for four decades. In 1991, the government of India initiated a liberalisation policy under P. V. Narasimha Rao. Narasimha Rao also had the responsibility of industries minister; he is directly responsible for dismantling the Licence Raj.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s the tides began to change. Liberalisation came to India and a growing belief began to rise that in fact rather than what Nehru believed, the Licence Raj was an important of Indian economic success, it was doing the opposite. This belief came from the proposition that India had to much of a heavy hand in the market and was stifling growth and preventing the Indian economy from reaching its full success. While it may have been important at the time to ensure a successful economic transition, the Licence Raj became outdated. \n\nLiberalisation resulted in substantial growth in the Indian economy, which continues today. The Licence Raj is considered to have been significantly reduced in 1991 when India had only two weeks of foreign reserves left. In return for an IMF bailout, India transferred gold bullion to London as collateral, devalued the Rupee, and accepted economic reforms. The federal government, with Manmohan Singh as finance minister, reduced licensing regulations; lowered tariffs, duties and taxes; and opened up to international trade and investment.\n\nThe reform policies introduced after 1991 removed many economic restrictions. Industrial licensing was abolished for almost all product categories, except for alcohol, tobacco, hazardous chemicals, industrial explosives, electronics, aerospace and pharmaceuticals.\n\nOn 6 August 2014 the Indian Parliament raised the limit on foreign direct investment in the defence sector to 49% and removed the limit for certain classes of infrastructure projects: high speed railways, including construction, operation and maintenance of high-speed train projects; suburban corridor projects through PPP; dedicated freight lines; rolling stock including train sets; locomotives manufacturing and maintenance facilities; railway electrification and signalling systems; freight terminals and passenger terminals; infrastructure in industrial park pertaining to railway line, and mass rapid transport systems.\n\n"}

{"id": "1938172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938172", "title": "Red-tailed black cockatoo", "text": "Red-tailed black cockatoo\n\nThe red-tailed black cockatoo (\"Calyptorhynchus banksii\") also known as Banksian- or Banks' black cockatoo, is a large black cockatoo native to Australia. Adult males have a characteristic pair of bright red panels on the tail that gives the species its name. It is more common in the drier parts of the continent. Five subspecies are recognised, differing chiefly in beak size. Although the more northerly subspecies are widespread, the two southern subspecies, the forest red-tailed black cockatoo and the south-eastern red-tailed black cockatoo are under threat.\n\nThe species is usually found in eucalyptus woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly parts of the country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally \"Eucalyptus\". Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.\n\nThe species complex was first described by the ornithologist John Latham in 1790 as \"Psittacus banksii\", commemorating English botanist Sir Joseph Banks. The red-tailed black cockatoo also has the distinction of being the first bird from Eastern Australia illustrated by a European, as a female, presumably collected at Endeavour River in north Queensland, was sketched by Banks' draughtsman Sydney Parkinson in 1770. Narrowly predating Latham, English naturalist George Shaw described \"Psittacus magnificus\" from a specimen collected somewhere in the Port Jackson (now Sydney) region. For many years, the species was referred to as \"Calyptorhynchus magnificus\", proposed by Gregory Mathews in 1927 as Shaw's name had predated Latham's 1790 description. For several decades, Mathews' proposal was accepted by many authorities, although it was unclear whether the original Port Jackson reference had actually referred to the red-tailed black or, more likely, the glossy black cockatoo. In 1994, an application to conserve \"Calyptorhynchus banksii\" as the scientific name was accepted by the ICZN. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the type species of the genus \"Calyptorhynchus\", the name of which is derived from the Greek \"calypto-\"/καλυπτο- \"hidden\" and \"rhynchus\"/ρυγχος \"beak\". The change was first made by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1826.\n\nIn 1827, Jennings proposed the name \"Psittacus niger\" for the bird. The binomial combination had already been used by Carl Linnaeus for the lesser vasa parrot in 1758, and by Johann Friedrich Gmelin for the palm cockatoo in 1788; it was thus invalid even though both other species were already known by different names at the time. Alternate common names include \"Banks' black cockatoo\", \"Banksian black cockatoo\", or simply \"black cockatoo\". Indigenous people of the central Cape York Peninsula have several names for the bird: \"(minha) pachang\" in Pakanh; \"(inh -) inhulg\" in Uw Oykangand; and \"(inh -) anhulg\" in Uw Olkola. (The bracketed prefix (\"inh-\" or \"minha\") is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal'.) \"Ngarnarrh\" or \"karnamarr\" are terms used by the Kunwinjku of Arnhem Land. In Central Australia, southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara term for the subspecies \"C. b. samueli\" is \"iranti\". \"Karrak\" is a Noongar term derived from the call for the southwestern race \"C. b. naso\". In the language of the Bungandidj of south-eastern South Australia and western Victoria this bird was called \"treen\".\n\nThe red-tailed black cockatoo's closest relative is the glossy black cockatoo; the two species form the subgenus \"Calyptorhynchus\" within the genus of the same name. They are distinguished from the other black cockatoos of the subgenus \"Zanda\" by their significant sexual dimorphism and calls of the juveniles; one a squeaking begging call, the other a vocalization when swallowing food.\n\nA 1999 mtDNA phylogenetic study of cockatoos utilizing among others, the red-tailed black cockatoo supported the hypotheses that cockatoos originated in Australia before the Paleogene and Neogene periods (66 mya, marking the end of the Mesozoic, to 2.6 mya) and that the genus \"Cacatua\" diversified in two separate radiations to the islands of Indonesia, New Guinea, and the South Pacific. It concluded that the first extant cockatoo to diverge from the ancestral cockatoos was the palm cockatoo, followed by a subclade containing the black cockatoos.\n\nA 2008 mitochondrial and nuclear DNA phylogenetic study of the parrots, cockatoos and related taxa by utilizing among others the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, provides confirmatory evidence for a Gondwanaland origin of the ancestral parrots in the Cretaceous period, and an Australasia divergence of the ancestral cockatoos from the parrots in either late Cretaceous (66 mya) or Paleogene (45 mya) periods depending on baseline assumptions.\n\nFive subspecies are recognised; they differ mainly in the size and shape of the beak, the overall bird size and female colouration:\n\n\nRed-tailed black cockatoos are around 60 centimetres (24 in) in length and sexually dimorphic. The male's plumage is all black with a prominent black crest made up of elongated feathers from the forehead and crown. The bill is dark grey. The tail is also black with two lateral bright red panels. Females are black with yellow-orange stripes in the tail and chest, and yellow grading to red spots on the cheeks and wings. The bill is pale and horn-coloured. The underparts are barred with fine yellow over a black base. Male birds weigh between 670 and 920 grams (1.5–2 lb), while females weigh slightly less at 615–870 grams (1.25–1.75 lb). In common with other cockatoos and parrots, red-tailed black cockatoos have zygodactyl feet, two toes facing forward and two backward, that allow them to grasp objects with one foot while standing on the other, for feeding and manipulation. Black cockatoos are almost exclusively left-footed (along with nearly all other cockatoos and most parrots).\n\nJuvenile red-tailed black cockatoos resemble females until puberty, which occurs around four years of age, but have paler yellow barred underparts. As the birds reach maturity, males gradually replace their yellow tail feathers with red ones; the complete process takes around four years.\n\nAs with other cockatoos, the red-tailed black cockatoo can be very long-lived in captivity; in 1938, ornithologist Neville Cayley reported one over fifty years old at Taronga Zoo. Another bird residing at London and Rotterdam Zoos was 45 years and 5 months of age when it died in 1979.\n\nSeveral calls of red-tailed black cockatoos have been recorded. The bird's contact call is a rolling metallic \"krur-rr\" or \"kree\", which may carry long distances and is always given while flying; its alarm call is sharp. Displaying males vocalize a sequence of soft growling followed by a repetitive \"kred-kred-kred-kred\".\n\nThe red-tailed black cockatoo principally occurs across the drier parts of Australia. It is widespread and abundant in a broad band across the northern half of the country, where it has been considered an agricultural pest, with more isolated distribution in the south. It is found in a wide variety of habitats, from shrublands and grasslands through eucalypt, sheoak and \"Acacia\" woodlands, to dense tropical rainforests. The bird is dependent on large, old eucalypts for nesting hollows, although the specific gums used vary in different parts of the country.\n\nCockatoos are not wholly migratory, but they do exhibit regular seasonal movements in different parts of Australia. In the northern parts of the Northern Territory, they largely leave areas of high humidity in the summer wet season. In other parts of the country cockatoo seasonal movements tend to follow food sources, a pattern recorded in Northern Queensland, and New South Wales. In southwest Western Australia, both extant subspecies appear to have a north–south pattern; northwards after breeding in the case of subspecies \"naso\", while movements by subspecies \"samueli\" in the wheatbelt can be irregular and unrelated to the seasons.\n\nRed-tailed black cockatoos are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and are often seen flying high overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks of up to 500 birds are generally only seen in the north or when the birds are concentrated at some food source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, \"graptogyne\" and \"naso\", are almost exclusively arboreal. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.\n\nThe male red-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers, and hiding the beak; it then sings and struts, ending in a jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him. Breeding generally takes place from May to September except in the case of the South-eastern subspecies, which nests during summer (December to February). Pairs of the subspecies \"samueli\" in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia may produce two broods, while those of South-eastern subspecies only produce one. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. Hollows can be 1 to 2 metres (3–7 ft) deep and 0.25–0.5 metres (10–20 in) wide, with a base of woodchips. A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.\nAlthough red-tailed black cockatoos feed on a wide variety of native and introduced grains, the mainstay of their diet is eucalyptus seeds. There is a specific relationship between the species and larger-fruited species of gums. These vary across Australia but include the marri in Southwest Western Australia, Darwin woolybutt \"E. miniata\" across the north of the country, \"E. baxteri\" in Victoria and the bloodwood species \"Corymbia polycarpa\" and \"C. intermedia\" in Queensland. Cockatoos bite off branchlets with clusters of seed capsules, then hold them with their feet while chewing and harvesting seeds before littering the ground with debris. Among other seeds and nuts consumed are those of \"Acacia\", \"Allocasuarina\", \"Banksia\", \"Grevillea\" and \"Hakea\", as well as berries, fruits and various insects. Cockatoos have adapted to eating some introduced plants such as the doublegee (\"Emex australis\"). There is some evidence of consumption of wild radish (\"Raphanus raphanistrum\"), wild turnip (\"Brassica tournefortii\") and melon (\"Citrullus\" or \"Cucumis\"). Red-tailed black cockatoos have been implicated as agricultural pests of peanut and other crops at Lakeland Downs in Far North Queensland. Here the cockatoos, in flocks of up to several hundred birds, have learned to sever the peanut plants above ground level before pulling the peanuts out of the ground by their stems and shelling them. They also damage electrical cables on pivot irrigators.\n\nThe red-tailed black cockatoo is protected under the Australian \"Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection) Act 2001\".\nThese birds are listed internationally under Appendix II of CITES, which allows international trade in live wild-caught and captive-bred specimens, if such exports are not detrimental to wild populations. However, the current Australian restrictions on commercial exports from Australia are not imposed by CITES. \"C. b. graptogyne\" is also specifically listed as endangered on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.\n\nStatus of the red-tailed black cockatoo as a species, and as a subspecies, also varies from state to state within Australia. For example:\n\n\nLike many Australian cockatoos and parrots, the red-tailed black cockatoo is threatened by the thriving illegal trade in bird smuggling. High demand and high transit mortality mean that many more birds are taken from the wild than actually sold.\n\nIn 1997, the Northern Territory Government's Department of Natural Resources, Environment and The Arts (now defunct) proposed a plan for management of the trade in eggs and nestlings of \"C. b. macrorhynchus\". To date the plan has not been implemented.\nThe Australian Senate inquiry into the Commercial Utilisation of Australian Native Wildlife concluded in early 1998 that routine capture and commercial use of adult wild birds should be prohibited.\n\nThe bird is part of an annual census, the Great Cocky count, that has been held every year since 2009 to track the population change of Red-tailed and other black cockatoos.\n\nIn the late 1990s, red-tailed black cockatoos fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas. Hand-raised birds can be bought for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture. Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate, although males may become imprinted and unlikely to breed. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly seen of the black cockatoos in captivity, and can be hardy and long-lived if given plenty of space. Until now, most birds in captivity have been of subspecies \"C. b. banksii\" and \"C. b. samueli\". Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. However, with an increase in interest in conservation, more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid crossbreeding.\n\nThe birds breed easily in captivity and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between February and November. Once the female has one egg in her nest, she will not lay another. An egg takes about 30 days to hatch. The eyes of the young open around 3 weeks and the yellow down will show black pin feathers at about 6 weeks. The best time for hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers are in place but the tail feathers are still short. Young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have the colouring of their mother. Mature male birds will become aggressive to young male birds at puberty (4 years); they must be separated if caged.\n\nThe large and powerful bills of these birds can quickly and easily open a Brazil nut (normally requiring crushing in a vise or pounding with a hammer), shearing it as neatly as a laser. They can also demolish a whole coconut with husk in 3 days.\n\nCaptive breeding guidelines may be found in \"Husbandry Guidelines for the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo\" (Bennett, 2008).\n\n\n\n"}

His crew of DJs is called \"The Supermen\", and his DJ moniker is derived from the name of Superman's alter ego.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Clark Kent was rapper Dana Dane's DJ. Around 1989, Kent would DJ at clubs such as one just around the block from Downtown Records on West 26th Street in Manhattan which was a short-lived hip-hop hotbed with other DJs also performing there such as Funkmaster Flex and Kid Capri.\n\nIn 1989, he produced the remix for Troop's hit song \"Spread My Wings.\" Clark scored his first street hit with the Junior M.A.F.I.A. song \"Player's Anthem\" which featured The Notorious B.I.G. and was also the first record that Lil' Kim appeared on. The biggest hit he produced was \"Loverboy\" by Mariah Carey, which peaked at #2 in the US on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. He also produced tracks for artists such as Lil' Kim, The Notorious B.I.G., Mad Skillz, Estelle, Lil' Vicious, Mona Lisa, 50 Cent, Canibus, Slick Rick and Rakim as well as groups such as The Future Sound and Original Flavor, both of which were signed to East West Records and Atlantic Records respectively, both groups having been signed by Clark who was a director of A&R at Atlantic at the time.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Clark Kent took over the job of MC for the then-titled New Music Seminar, a battle between the best DJs in hip hop. Renaming it \"Clark Kent's Superman Battle for World Supremacy\", he would go on to host the event for a number of years. One of the most famous battles in this arena was the legendary 1994 match between DJ Noize and DJ 8-Ball, which resulted in a landslide victory for Noize and 8-Ball's subsequent humiliation. After the last set, Clark Kent is heard telling the crowd \"I don't need to even TELL you all who won!\"\n\nOriginal Flavor, on their single \"Can I Get Open\", featured a guest appearance by a then little known rapper named Jay-Z. This would lead to further collaborations between the two, as Franklin would go on to produce three tracks on Jay-Z's critically acclaimed debut album, \"Reasonable Doubt\". The tracks were: \"Brooklyn's Finest\", which featured Notorious B.I.G., \"Coming of Age\" and \"Cashmere Thoughts.\" On his \"retirement album\" \"The Black Album\", Jay-Z alludes to Clark Kent's role in helping him break into the industry, in the last song on the album (titled \"My 1st Song\"). He states: \"Clark Kent, that was good lookin' out, nigga.\"\n\nClark accidentally overheard the then unknown rapper Moses Michael Leviy (AKA Jamal Barrow BKA Shyne) rhyming in a barbershop, who, noting the young MC's vocal similarity to Notorious B.I.G., steered him towards Combs and Bad Boy.\n\nHe is also the cousin of recording artist Foxy Brown.\n\nIn 2010, Nike commissioned DJ Clark Kent to design a \"Nike Five Boroughs AF1 Low\" pack of special limited edition Nike Air Force 1 shoes and unveiled them at a fully catered block party in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood on Mercer Street outside the Nike ID store at 21 Mercer.\n\n"}

{"id": "1938220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938220", "title": "Extension conflict", "text": "Extension conflict\n\nExtension conflicts were sometimes a problem on Apple Macintosh computers running the classic Mac OS, especially System 7. Extensions were bundles of code that extended the operating system's capabilities by directly patching OS calls, thus receiving control instead of the operating system when applications (including the Finder) made system calls. Generally, once an extension completed it's task, it was supposed to pass on the (possibly modified) system call to the operating system's routine. If multiple extensions want to patch the same system call, they end up receiving the call in a chain, the first extension in line passing it on to the next, and so on, until the last extension passes to the operating system. If an extension does not hand the next extension in line what it is expecting, problems occur; ranging from unexpected behavior to full system crashes. This is triggered by several factors such as carelessly programmed and malicious extensions that change or disrupts the way part of the system software works.\n\nIn addition, extensions sometimes competed for system resources with applications, utilities and other extensions, leading to crashes and general instability. Many users happily loaded every extension they could find on their computer, with little or no impact. Others fastidiously avoided any non-essential extensions as a way of avoiding the problem. Others were judicious in the addition of extensions.\n\nThis problem increased during the mid-1990s as resource-hungry multimedia technologies such as QuickTime were installed as extensions. In addition, a number of applications, especially Microsoft Office, required a large number of extensions. Many Macintosh users had hundreds of extensions running on their systems, all of varying age and quality. Buggy, damaged and outdated extensions were the most common cause of problems. Some users had to remember to turn off problematic extensions when running certain programs.\n\nLater versions of System 7 included the Extensions Manager, which allowed users to turn off specific extensions or groups of extensions at startup when troubleshooting the conflict by pressing the Spacebar while the computer boots. This tool was also accessible by heading to the Extensions panel in the Control Panels found in the Apple menu. Conflict Catcher, a third party utility, automatically detected conflicts and problematic extensions, otherwise a time-consuming task that required users to turn off extensions in sets until they found the conflict. Extensions were only loaded at startup time, meaning that any attempted change required a reboot.\n\nThe most common time for extension conflicts to start was the release of a new version of the operating system, followed closely by the installation of a new application that either conflicted with existing extensions, or installed extensions that conflicted with the existing set.\n\nAll of this was mitigated by the ease with which extensions and the operating system itself could be swapped in and out: Instead of modifying configuration files as on other operating systems, extensions simply had to reside in a particular folder to be picked up. In addition, the Mac was perfectly happy to have two (or more) system folders present on a hard drive. Only the \"blessed\" system folder would be loaded at startup. So, when a new version of the operating system was to be installed, or a new application, the user could easily duplicate the system folder, perform the install, and then fall back if a problem resulted.\n\nExtension conflicts came to an end with the release of Mac OS X, which uses a different extension mechanism. Software can still add new features to the Mac but instead of extensions, the new method entailed writing startup applications, which is considered safer and more organized approach that cannot destabilize the machine.\n\n"}
{"id": "1938226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938226", "title": "Molecular imprinting", "text": "Molecular imprinting\n\nMolecular imprinting is a technique to create template-shaped cavities in polymer matrices with predetermined selectivity and high affinity. This technique is based on the system used by enzymes for substrate recognition, which is called the \"lock and key\" model. The active binding site of an enzyme has a shape specific to a substrate. Substrates with a complementary shape to the binding site selectively bind to the enzyme; alternative shapes that do not fit the binding site are not recognized. \n\nMolecularly imprinted materials are prepared using a template molecule and functional monomers that assemble around the template and subsequently get cross-linked to each other. The monomers, which are self-assembled around the template molecule by interaction between functional groups on both the template and monomers, are polymerized to form an imprinted matrix (commonly known in the scientific community as a molecular imprinted polymer (MIP)). The template is subsequently removed in part or entirely, leaving behind a cavity complementary in size and shape to the template. The obtained cavity can work as a selective binding site for the templated molecule.\n\nIn recent decades, the molecular imprinting technique has been developed for use in drug delivery, separations, biological and chemical sensing, and more. Taking advantage of the shape selectivity of the cavity, use in catalysis for certain reactions has also been facilitated. \n\nThe first example of molecular imprinting is attributed to M. V. Polyakov in 1931 with his studies in the polymerization of sodium silicate with ammonium carbonate. When the polymerization process was accompanied by an additive such as benzene, the resulting silica showed a higher uptake of this additive. By 1949, the concept of instructional theory molecular imprinting was used by Dickey; his research precipitated silica gels in the presence of organic dyes and showed imprinted silica had high selectivity towards the template dye.\n\nFollowing Dickey’s observations, Patrikeev published a paper of his ‘imprinted’ silica with the method of incubating bacteria with gel silica. The process of drying and heating the silica promoted growth of bacteria better than other reference silicas and exhibited enantioselectivity. He later used this imprinted silica method in further applications such as thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In 1972, Wulff and Klotz introduced molecular imprinting to organic polymers. They found that molecular recognition was possible by covalently introducing functional groups within the imprinted cavity of polymers. The Mosbach group then proved it was possible to introduce functional groups into imprinted cavities through non-covalent interactions, thus leading to non-covalent imprinting. Many approaches regarding molecular imprinting have since been extended to different purposes. \n\nIn covalent imprinting, the template molecule is covalently bonded to the functional monomers that are then polymerized together. After polymerization, the polymer matrix is cleaved from the template molecule, leaving a cavity shaped as the template. Upon rebinding with the original molecule, the binding sites will interact with the target molecule, reestablishing the covalent bonds. During this reestablishment, kinetics associated with bond binding and bond breakage are obtained back. The imprinted molecule is then released from the template, in which it would then rebind with the target molecule, forming the same covalent bonds that were formed before polymerization. Advantages through utilizing this approach include the functional group being solely associated with the binding sites, avoiding any non-specific binding. The imprinted molecule also displays a homogenous distribution of binding sites, increasing the stability of the template-polymer complex. However, there are a few number of compounds that can be use to imprint with template molecules via covalent bonding, such as alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, all of which have high formation kinetics. In some cases, the rebinding of the polymer matrix with the template can be very slow, making this approach time inefficient for applications that require fast kinetics, such as chromatography.\n\nWith non-covalent imprinting, interaction forces between template molecule and functional monomer are the same as the interaction forces between the polymer matrix and analyte. The forces involved in this procedure can include hydrogen bonds, dipole dipole interactions, and induced dipole forces. This method is the most widely used approach to create MIPs due to easy preparation and the wide variety of functional monomers that can be bound to the template molecule. Among the functional groups, methacrylic acid is the most commonly used compound due to its ability to interact with other functional groups. Another way to alternate the non-covalent interaction between the template molecule and polymer is through the technique ‘bait and switch’. In this process, functional groups first non-covalently bond with the binding site, but during the rebinding step, the polymer matrix forms irreversible covalent bonds with the target molecule.\n\nIonic imprinting, which involves metal ions, serves as an approach to enhance template molecule and functional monomer interaction in water. Typically, metal ions serve as a mediator during the imprinting process. Cross-linking polymers that are in the presence of a metal ion will form a matrix that is capable of metal binding. Metal ions can also mediate molecular imprinting by binding to a range of functional monomers, where ligands donate electrons to the outermost orbital of the metal ion. In addition to mediating imprinting, metal ions can be utilized in the direct imprinting. For example, a metal ion can serve as the template for the imprinting process.\n\nOne application of molecular imprinting technology is in affinity-based separations for biomedical, environmental, and food analysis. Sample preconcentration and treatment can be carried out by removing targeted trace amounts of analytes in samples using MIPs. The feasibility of MIPs in solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, and stir bar sorption extraction has been studied in several publications. Moreover, chromatography techniques such as HPLC and TLC can make use of MIPs as packing materials and stationary phases for the separation of template analytes. The kinetics of noncovalently imprinted materials were observed to be faster than materials prepared by the covalent approach, so noncovalent MIPs are more commonly used in chromatography. \n\nAnother application is the use of molecularly imprinted materials as chemical and biological sensors. They have been developed to target herbicides, sugars, drugs, toxins, and vapors. MIP-based sensors not only have high selectivity and high sensitivity, but they can also generate output signals (electrochemical, optical, or piezoelectric) for detection. This allows them to be utilized in fluorescence sensing, electrochemical sensing, chemiluminescence sensing, and UV-Vis sensing. Forensic applications that delve into detections of illicit drugs, banned sport drugs, toxins, and chemical warfare agents are also an area of growing interest. \n\nMolecular imprinting has steadily been emerging in fields like drug delivery and biotechnology. The selective interaction between template and polymer matrix can be utilized in preparation of artificial antibodies. In the biopharmaceutical market, separation of amino acids, chiral compounds, hemoglobin, and hormones can be achieved with MIP adsorbents. Methods to utilize molecular imprinting techniques for mimicking linear and polyanionic molecules, such as DNA, proteins, and carbohydrates have been researched. An area of challenges is protein imprinting. Large, water-soluble biological macromolecules have posed a difficulty for molecular imprinting because their conformational integrity cannot be ensured in synthetic environments. Current methods to navigate this include immobilizing template molecules at the surface of solid substrates, thereby minimizing aggregation and controlling the template molecules to locate at the surface of imprinted materials. However, a critical review of molecular imprinting of proteins by scientists from Utrecht University found that further testing is required. \n\nPharmaceutical applications include selective drug delivery and control drug release systems, which make use of MIPs’ stable conformations, fast equilibrium release, and resistance to enzymatic and chemical stress. Intelligent drug release, the release of a therapeutic agent as a result of a specific stimuli, has also been explored. Molecularly imprinted materials of insulin and other drugs at the nanoscale were shown to exhibit high adsorption capacity for their respective targets, showing huge potential for newfound drug delivery systems. In comparison with natural receptors, MIPs also have higher chemical and physical stability, easier availability, and lower cost. MIPs could especially be used for stabilization of proteins, particularly selective protection of proteins against denaturation from heat.\n\n\n"}

By the time Takakura left Toei in 1976, he had appeared in over 180 films.\n\nHe gained international recognition after starring in the 1970 war film \"Too Late the Hero\" as the cunning Imperial Japanese Major Yamaguchi, the 1974 Sydney Pollack sleeper hit \"The Yakuza\" with Robert Mitchum, and is probably best known in the West for his role in Ridley Scott's \"Black Rain\" (1989) where he surprises American cops played by Michael Douglas and Andy García with the line, \"I do speak fucking English\". He again appeared to Western audiences with the 1992 Fred Schepisi comedy \"Mr. Baseball\" starring Tom Selleck.\n\nTakakura was one of the few Japanese actors who experienced popularity in China, due to his appearance in Junya Satō's 1976 crime drama \"Kimi yo Fundo no Kawa o Watare\" (known in some territories as \"Manhunt\"), the first foreign film shown after the Cultural Revolution.\n\nHe appeared in three films since 2000: in May 2001, \"Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles\", by Chinese director Zhang Yimou, in late December 2005, and Yasuo Furuhata's \"Anata e\" (\"Dearest\") in late August 2012, after a six-year hiatus. He died of lymphoma on November 10, 2014. Shintaro Ishihara described him as \"the last big star (in Japan).\" A huge number of Chinese internet users expressed their sympathies and condolences, including many celebrities in the Chinese movie industry. The spokesman of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hong Lei said that Takakura made significant contributions to the cultural exchange between China and Japan.\n\nA documentary based on Takakura's life entitled \"Ken San\" premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and was released in Japanese theaters on August 20, 2016. It was directed by photographer Yuichi Hibi and features interviews with filmmakers and actors such as Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader, Michael Douglas, John Woo, and Yoji Yamada.\n\n\n"}

His career as a screen actor started in 1973 with a role as a junior police officer in a TV detective drama called \"Taiyō ni Hoero!\" He went on to appear in various television series and action films during the seventies. His most remembered role on television was in \"Tantei Monogatari\", in which he starred as an unlikely private detective. In films, he was known for such gun-toting roles as assassin Shōhei Narumi in the \"Yūgi\" (\"Game\") series of films, and master criminal Asakura in \"Resurrection of the Golden Wolf\".\n\nIn the 1980s, desiring to be seen as more than an action star, he moved from action films to a wider range of dramatic roles. He made a dramatic weight loss to appear in the film \"The Beast to Die\" in 1980. The following year he appeared in another action film, \"Yokohama BJ Blues\", which also featured his singing, and the surreal art film \"Kagerō-za\". In 1983, he won the award for best actor at the 8th Hochi Film Award for \"Detective Story\" and \"The Family Game\". In 1985 he took the lead role in the award-winning \"Sorekara\". In 1986, he directed \"A Homansu\", after the scheduled director left due to disagreements. This was the only film he directed. During the eighties, he also appeared in many commercials, such as for Gatsby hair products or Triangle shochu. In addition to acting, from the late seventies to the eighties he toured as a singer, releasing several albums of music.\n\nIn 1989, although already diagnosed with cancer, he starred as the villain, Sato, in \"Black Rain\". Director Ridley Scott and co-stars Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia, and Kate Capshaw praised his professionalism and performance, despite his suffering. He died shortly afterwards, after making a final appearance in a special television drama with Florence Griffith-Joyner, in which he was supposed to run against her, but was unable to do so because of his illness.\n\nAfter his death, his image continued to be used in commercials, such as a 2000 campaign for Schick razors using his image from the \"Tantei Monogatari\" television series. Books, films, television specials, and other products, such as scale models of his most famous characters, continue to appear long after his death. In 1998, a film called \"Yomigaeru Yūsaku: Tantei Monogatari Tokubetsu-hen\" was released, containing two episodes of the \"Tantei Monogatari\" television series and some additional material. In 2009, his second wife, Miyuki Matsuda, produced a tribute film, \"Soul Red\", including clips from his films and interviews with actors such as Andy Garcia, as well as his two sons.\n\nMatsuda was born out of wedlock in Shimonoseki, to a Japanese father, a probation officer, whom he never met, and a Zainichi Korean mother, Kaneko Matsuda, originally Kim. She was a Korean who had married a Japanese man who died during World War II. Kaneko deliberately wrongly recorded his birth year as 1950 on his birth records.\n\nHe grew up and was educated in Shimonoseki, attending Kanda elementary school and Bunyo Junior High School, before entering Shimonoseki Secondary School. In 1967, while at high school, at the urging of his mother, he stayed with his aunt in the city of Seaside in America for one year. He attended Seaside High School. However, extremely unhappy in America, malnourished, unable to speak English, and feeling himself the victim of discrimination, he returned to Japan. Because he was afraid of facing his mother, he went to stay with his older brother in Tokyo. He attended as a night student and graduated in 1969. After graduating, he entered a theatre company called , leaving in November 1969. In 1971 he joined a theatre group \"Club Marui\", then in 1972 he joined \"Bungakuza\". He met his future wife Michiko through Club Marui in May 1971. At the time he was working as a barman.\n\nHe changed his citizenship from Korean to Japanese while he was starring in \"Taiyō ni Hoero!\", with the help of Michiko, whose father was a member of the Liberal Democratic party who was head of the then-Prime Minister's support office.\n\nIn 1975 he was involved in two fracas, first with two journalists, and then with a student who attacked him with a wooden kendo sword because the student thought he was assaulting a woman. The student ended up in a hospital, and Matsuda received a suspended sentence for assault. This caused a major disruption in his career, with film studios and television companies dropping him.\n\nHe married Michiko Kumamoto in 1975 and had one daughter. They divorced in 1981 after six years of marriage. In 1983, he married Miyuki Kumagai, with whom he had started a relationship in 1979, when she was 17, when she appeared in the television series \"Tantei Monogatari\". They had three children. Two of the children, Ryuhei and Shota, became actors and daughter Yuki became a singer.\n\nIn 1988, Matsuda was diagnosed with bladder cancer, before shooting began for \"Black Rain\". Matsuda refused chemotherapy, as he thought it would affect his ability to act in the film. After his death, his first wife, who had experienced him ignoring an ear infection until it required surgery to prevent deafness, wrote that she suspected that he did not actually realize the seriousness of his illness. During the filming, he was urinating blood. By the time shooting finished, in March 1989, his cancer had spread to his spine and lungs, making it inoperable. On October 7, 1989, Matsuda was hospitalized. A month after he was admitted, Matsuda died at 6:45 PM JST on November 6 at the age of 40, at a Tokyo hospital. He was buried in in Akiruno, Tokyo.\n\n"}

It is linked with the top-level Eredivisie and with the third-level Tweede Divisie via promotion/relegation systems. It is also known as the Keuken Kampioen Divisie due to sponsorship, while previously it was known as Jupiler League for the same reason.\n\nThe Eerste Divisie consists of 20 clubs, who play each other in a double round-robin league, with each club playing the other club home and away. Each club plays every other club once in the first half of the season before the league takes a winter break around the Christmas and New Year's holiday season. The second half of the season sees the same fixtures as the first half, with the stadiums changed, although the two halves are not played in the same order.\n\nAt the end of each season, the champion and the runner-up of the Eerste Divisie are automatically promoted to the Eredivisie. Seven other clubs enter the \"Nacompetitie\" , a promotion/relegation playoff that includes the 16th-placed club in the Eredivisie. The following teams qualify for the Nacompetitie:\n\nIf the club that wins a period has qualified for the Nacompetitie by winning a previous period, its place is filled by the next-best club in that period that has not already qualified. Usually, the clubs that qualify for the Nacompetitie turn out to be the 3rd- through 9th-placed clubs in the final table. Clubs in the Nacompetitie face each other in a knock-out system with the number 16 of the Eredivisie for one place in next season's Eredivisie.\n\nBetween seasons 1971–72 and 2007–09 teams could not relegate from the Eerste Divisie. From the 2009–10 season onwards, one team has been relegated from the Eerste Divisie to the \"Hoofdklasse\" (then the main amateur league of Dutch football). From the 2010–11 to 2015–16 seasons, the KNVB introduced a third and highest amateur tier called \"Topklasse\", and \"Hoofdklasse\" clubs have been able to get promoted to that new division.\n\nBefore the 2008–09 season, Hoofdklasse clubs could promote by obtaining a professional licence. However, only a club going bankrupt or losing their license could result in clubs leaving professional football. The last clubs leaving professional football in that way were FC Wageningen and VCV Zeeland in 1992, and more recently HFC Haarlem and RBC Roosendaal, who went bankrupt in January 2010 and June 2011 respectively. The most recent additions to the league were AGOVV Apeldoorn in 2003 and FC Omniworld in 2005, expanding the league to 19 and later 20 clubs. However, for the 2010–11 season, the league returned to 18 clubs, as HFC Haarlem went bankrupt and FC Oss were relegated to the newly formed Topklasse. The 2012–13 season ended with 16 teams after AGOVV and BV Veendam went bankrupt. Four teams have been added to bring the division back up to 20 teams in 2013. Achilles '29 has been promoted from the Topklasse with the reserve teams of Ajax, FC Twente and PSV being added as well.\n\nSince the 2016–17 season there is automatic relegation to the third-tier, semi-professional Tweede Divisie. Clubs in the Tweede Divisie had to announce in mid-season if they want to be eligible for promotion. Only if one of those clubs won the Tweede Divisie championship is a team relegated from the Eerste Divisie.\n\nClubs with larger fanbases suffered relegation in the 2000s, with Roda JC setting the Eerste Divisie attendance record at 16.150 during their home game against N.E.C. in the 2014–15 season. NAC Breda bettered it a season later in their home match against Go Ahead Eagles, which had an attendance of 17.800 people.\n\n Blauw Wit, De Volewijckers and DWS merged into FC Amsterdam, which folded in 1982.

{"id": "1938253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938253", "title": "EdStone", "text": "EdStone\n\nThe \"EdStone\" was a large stone tablet which was commissioned by the Labour Party during the 2015 United Kingdom general election. The stone was tall and featured six election pledges carved into it, together with the Labour logo, and a copy of signature of the party leader Ed Miliband. It was much mocked; for example, John Rentoul, Tony Blair's biographer, described it as the \"most absurd, ugly, embarrassing, childish, silly, patronising, ridiculous gimmick I have ever seen\".\n\nThe Labour Party failed to declare the cost of the stone in its election finances report and was therefore fined by the Electoral Commission.\n\nThe tablet was produced by stoneCIRCLE, a Basingstoke-based stonemasonry company; the firm signed a confidentiality clause. It was rumoured to have cost £30,000, but invoices later showed the cost was £7,614.\n\nThe tablet was unveiled on 3 May 2015, in a car park in the marginal constituency of Hastings and Rye, which Labour hoped to take from the Conservative Party. The purpose of the stone was to illustrate Labour's commitment to its promises, contrasting this with the failure of the Liberal Democrats to keep their 2010 election campaign pledge to abolish tuition fees.\n\nThe six pledges written on the stone were:\n\nMiliband had pledged that if Labour won the election the stone was to have stood in the Downing Street Rose Garden \"as a reminder of our duty to keep Labour's promises\".\n\nThe stone became a source of near universal ridicule. It was unfavourably compared to the stone tablets in the story of Moses and the Ten Commandments, and to a cemetery headstone. In a matter of hours Twitter users had declared it the \"EdStone\".\n\nThen Mayor of London Boris Johnson (now Prime Minister) called it \"some weird commie slab\", whilst shadow transport minister Michael Dugher later admitted it was a \"12ft, granite, marble, cock-up\" – though the tablet was actually limestone. Dan Hodges reported that while watching Miliband unveil the tablet on television, a Labour press officer \"started screaming. He stood in the office, just screaming over and over again at the screen. It was so bad they thought he was having a breakdown\". A party adviser said after the election that \"The only reason it got through 10 planning meetings was because we were all distracted, looking for a way to punch through on the SNP\". By the evening it had also been called the \"heaviest suicide note in history\", a reference to a famous description of Labour's unpopular 1983 manifesto, dubbed \"the longest suicide note in history\".\n\nLucy Powell, the Labour campaign's vice-chair, was widely thought to have committed a gaffe about the stone, when she said on Radio 5 Live: \"I don't think anyone is suggesting that the fact that he's carved them in stone means he's absolutely not going to break them or anything like that\". This was particularly damaging as the whole point of the stone had been to underline the seriousness of Miliband's commitment.\n\nLabour reportedly had two plans for its break-up and destruction if the party lost the election: Throw the rubble away, or sell Berlin Wall-like chunks to party members to raise money. After Labour performed worse than expected, and the Conservatives won a surprise overall majority, the location of the stone became the subject of widespread speculation. Labour officials refused to disclose its location, for which various newspapers offered rewards. \"The Daily Telegraph\" contacted 50 masonry firms in an attempt to find it, whilst the \"Daily Mail\" offered a reward of a case of champagne for its location, and \"The Sun\" set up a hotline for information.\n\nThe disappearance of the EdStone led to joking comparisons in the media with the Ark of the Covenant as portrayed in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", in which the Ark is stored in secret in a large warehouse, its location undisclosed.\n\nThe seat in which the stone was unveiled, Hastings and Rye, was held by the Conservatives, whose MP Amber Rudd increased her majority to 4,796, up 5.4%.\n\nAs of 15 May 2015 the EdStone was allegedly in storage inside a garage in South London. \"There are claims it has been destroyed\", \"The Guardian\" reported in early June 2015, \"but even Miliband's close advisers cannot confirm its fate.\" In January 2016 two party officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Bloomberg News that the stone had been destroyed in the weeks following 7 May 2015, putting an end to eight months of speculation about its whereabouts.\n\nIn May 2017, it was revealed that the EdStone had become a decoration in the Ivy Chelsea Garden restaurant on King's Road in West London. The restaurant's owners said that it had been bought two years earlier in a charity auction because it would be \"fun\" to have an \"iconic image of the election\" in the garden. Steve Vanhinsbergh, co-owner of stoneCIRCLE doubted this was the authentic stone, for practical reasons and the fact that he was \"99% sure\" it had been demolished.\n\nInitial enquiries aimed to determine why spending incurred on the stone tablet was missing from the Labour Party's campaign spending return. It was established that these payments, totalling £7,614, were missing from the party's return and the Electoral Commission launched an investigation which uncovered other undeclared expenses. The Commission concluded that the party's spending return was incomplete, as it omitted 74 payments totalling £123,748, along with 33 separate invoices totalling £34,392. The registered treasurer of the party, Iain McNicol committed two offences under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 and the Labour party was fined £20,000. At the time, this was the largest fine the Commission had imposed since it began operations in 2001.\n"}

It is native to eastern Australia and includes just two species, \"Eriostemon australasius\" and \"Eriostemon banksii\". \"Eriostemon australasius\", commonly known as pink wax flower, occurs between Fraser Island and Nowra and is a shrub of heathlands and low open woodlands. \"Eriostemon banksii\" is endemic to Cape York Peninsula and is a shrub or small tree occurring in heathland and rainforest margins.\n\nPlants in the genus \"Eriostemon\" are shrubs or small trees which have their thinnest branches, leaves and petals covered with fine star-like hairs (although the hairs may only be visible with a magnifying glass). The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are simple leaves with smooth edges. The leaves are long, wide and have three or five main veins. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils, and about in diameter. There are five separate sepals and five petals with their edges overlapping. There are ten stamens, all with hairy filaments.\n\nThe genus \"Eriostemon\" was first formally described in 1798 by James Edward Smith but he did not nominate a type species. The description was published in \"Transactions of the Linnean Society of London\". \"Eriostemon australasius\" was nominated as the lectotype by Paul Wilson in 1978. The genus name (\"Eriostemon\") is derived from the Ancient Greek words \"erion\" meaning \"wool\" and \"stemon\" meaning \"stamen\" referring to the woolly stamens.\n\nA large number of species once classified within the genus have been placed in the newer genus \"Philotheca\" including \"Eriostemon verrucosus\" (now \"Philotheca verrucosa\"), \"E. myoporoides\" (\"Philotheca myoporoides\") and \"E. buxifolius\" (\"Philotheca buxifolia\"). The only two species currently included are \"E. australasius\" and \"E. banksii\".\n\nPink wax flower is described as being a \"very desirable\" garden plant, however it is difficult to propagate and to maintain. A semi-shaded position in well-drained soil is regarded as the conditions best suited to the species.\n"}

By marriage she was Landgravine of Thuringia and Countess Palatine of Saxony (German: \"Landgräfin von Thüringen und Pfalzgräfin von Sachsen\").\n\nShe was the daughter of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Sicily and Germany, by his third wife, Isabella of England. Her paternal grandparents were Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor and Constance of Sicily. Her maternal grandparents were John of England and Isabella of Angoulême.\n\nThe date of her birth is difficult to ascertain because there is controversy over the exact number of children borne by her mother. Some sources say that she was the first or second child, born by the end of 1237; others say that she was the last child, born in December 1241, when Isabella died in childbirth. Historians commonly accept the latter date.\n\nShortly after her birth (1242), Margaret was betrothed to Albert \"the Degenerate\", eldest son and heir of Henry III \"the Illustrious\", Margrave of Meissen. The marriage took place in June 1255, the bride receiving Pleissnerland (the towns of Altenburg, Zwickau, Chemnitz and Leisnig) as her dowry.\n\nThe couple settled at his residence in Eckartsberga and later moved to Wartburg, where she bore five children: three sons (Henry, Frederick and Dietzmann) and two daughters (Margaret and Agnes). Through her second son Frederick – later Margrave of Meissen – Margaret was the direct ancestor of the Electors and Kings of Saxony and English Queen consorts Margaret of Anjou and Anne of Cleves.\n\nIn 1265 her husband received the titles of Landgrave of Thuringia and Count Palatine of Saxony () after the abdication of his father, who retained control of Meissen.\n\nAfter the execution of her nephew Conradin (29 October 1268), Margaret, as the next legitimate relative, became the rightful Queen of Sicily and the general heiress of the Hohenstaufen claims over the Duchy of Swabia and the Kingdom of Jerusalem (despite the fact she was not descended from the Kings of Jerusalem, her father Frederick II had claimed the kingdom for himself). Her son Frederick assumed by some time this titles on her right.\n\nAfter discovering the adultery of her husband with Kunigunde of Eisenberg, Margaret left Wartburg; according to a legend, before her departure she bit her son Frederick in the cheek; he was called henceforth Frederick the Bitten (de: \"Friedrich der Gebissene\").

{"id": "1938315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938315", "title": "Optare", "text": "Optare\n\nOptare () is an English bus manufacturer based in Sherburn-in-Elmet, North Yorkshire. It is a subsidiary of Indian company Ashok Leyland.\n\nIn September 1984, Leyland closed its Charles H Roe vehicle bodywork building business in Leeds. In response, Russell Richardson, a former plant director at Roe, backed by the West Yorkshire Enterprise Board and many redundant former employees, formed Optare in February 1985.\n\nThe company was created at a very difficult time for the bus and coach industry, with the challenges of privatisation and deregulation meaning very few orders for new vehicles. The first orders came from the still publicly owned West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (WYPTE) and South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE). The publicly owned but arms-length company Yorkshire Rider, as successor to the WYPTE bus fleet, also took early vehicles.\n\nWhen the Roe business closed down, WYPTE had an unfulfilled order for five Leyland Olympian coach-seated double-decker buses in place for its Metro coach operation. These five part finished buses went from Roe to Eastern Coach Works as shells for completion, but subsequently ten more were completed as Optare buses but to the Roe design, the first of which was completed in September 1985, the 17th Optare bus body. Five went to WYPTE, and five to its successor Yorkshire Rider, and a further five standard seated Olympians were also delivered to WYPTE, two as convertible open top buses.\n\nThe first Optare designed bodies were fourteen Dennis Dominos for the SYPTE built starting in February 1986. Optare also bodied fifteen Leyland Cubs for the WYPTE. A preserved Cub later visited the Optare plant in 2005.\n\nStarting in August 1986, Optare built fifteen minibuses converted from the Freight Rover Sherpa 350 vans for the WYPTE.\n\nIn 1986, Optare introduced the CityPacer minibus. This was based on a heavier version of the Volkswagen LT50 van chassis, to which Optare made modifications prior to bodying. The engine was a six-cylinder 2.4-litre and the body seated 25, with space for a further five standing passengers, a size that met the minibus vogue of the late 1980s. While its competitors looked like the modified vans they were, the CityPacer had attractive styling notable for its large one-piece raked windscreen. London Regional Transport bought 52, and other major operators bought small batches. More than 290 CityPacers were produced in total between 1986 and 1992.\n\nIn 1987, the StarRider based on the Mercedes-Benz 811D chassis was introduced. This was a heavier chassis with a proven reliability record and had seating for 33 passengers. London Regional Transport took 123 StarRiders and a total of just under 320 were built between 1987 and 1994.\n\nIn an attempt to break into the export market, the ColumboRider was subsequently developed, named after the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka, where the first examples were sold. The ColumboRider was a semi-integral version of the StarRider, based on a chassis made by a consortium including Optare, Japanese technology company Itochu and local Sri Lankan manufacturer Ceylinco. The ColumboRider was replaced by an export version of the MetroRider.\n\nIn 1990, Optare bodied thirteen Renault S50 minibuses with a welfare bodywork which has since come to be known as the 9000-series, due to the allocated body numbers. As standard, the 9000-series community transport minibus had a front door, nine passenger seats and a rear tail lift for wheelchair access. All thirteen examples built were delivered to Leeds City Council between March and May 1990, and no further orders were ever placed.\n\nIn 1988 the first full size Optare product appeared, the Delta. This was a single-deck bus based on the DAF SB220 chassis. The Delta bodywork featured contemporary styling and was aluminium with a bolted frame licensed from Alusuisse. The Delta successfully found a niche in the full-size single deck bus market, which was very limited at that time. Approaching 370 Deltas were built before production ended in 1998.\n\nDennis had effectively created a new market segment, known as a midibus, with the introduction of the Dennis Dart. Optare soon introduced a competitor, the Vecta, albeit slightly bigger and wider than the Dart at that time, seating 40 in a full width 2.5m body. The chassis was the MAN 11.190 and featured a ZF gearbox and full air suspension. The bodywork was a scaled down version of the Delta.\n\nThe CityPacer and StarRider were phased out in the years after Optare purchased the design for the MCW Metrorider in July 1989, rebranding it as the Optare MetroRider. This was a larger design than the CityPacer, and more robust when compared to the StarRider. It was Optare's first venture into fully integral vehicle manufacturing, and became the mainstay of the Optare midi/minbus offering until the low floor Solo was introduced in 1997.\n\nIn 1990, Optare joined a group called the United Bus, which included DAF Bus.\n\nHaving already used a DAF SB220 chassis on the Delta, now as part of United Bus, Optare collaborated with DAF to design the Optare Spectra. It was based on the modified design of the MCW Metrobus purchased by Optare, and combined parts from it and the SB220 to form a new double deck chassis, designated DB250, with Optare bodywork called Spectra. Due to the United bus relationship and joint design, the Spectra was built exclusively on DB250 chassis. As well as having a striking front end, the Spectra was also recognisable for having no rear window. Introduced in 1990 it was described as a \"partly low-floor double-decker\". Despite the association with DAF, in 1991 Optare also launched a conventional height midibus in on the MAN 11.180 chassis, the Vecta.\n\nAfter the collapse of United Bus in 1993, Optare was again returned to independent status with another management buyout. The reaction to the collapse of United Bus was the release in the next two years of two Delta derived single deck buses on different non-DAF chassis, the Sigma and Prisma, the latter being on the Mercedes-Benz O405 chassis which had a generic Mercedes-Benz style front end rather than the recognisable Optare family face.\n\nOptare acquired \"Autobus Classique\" in 1996, shortly after the launch of their Nouvelle luxury minicoach. Optare significantly redesigned and rebadged it in 1997 as the Nouvelle 2, and it served similar markets to the StarRider/MetroRider coach versions. Also in 1997 a relationship with a Spanish mini and midi coach manufacturer named Ferqui SL began, with the importation of the Solera luxury midicoach into the UK.\n\nWhile part of United Bus, Optare also for a time became the exclusive UK dealer for the distinctive full size Bova Futura coach.\n\nOptare began introduction of low-floor buses in the UK in 1995 with the launch of the Optare Excel full size single decker. Although low floor single decker buses had begun to appear as early as 1993. Initially, the Excel used Cummins engines and Allison Transmissions with later examples (Excel 2) having Mercedes-Benz engines available as an option. The introduction of the Excel marked the start of sustained period of selling integral bus products rather than body on chassis combinations, which continued until the Darwen merger briefly brought East Lancs models to the range.\n\nWith modifications of the DB250 chassis to become the DB250LF, in 1997, the Spectra became the first fully low-floor double decker bus on offer in the UK.\n\nAlso in 1997 the Solo was launched and became a success for Optare. With a unique design of a front axle forward of the door, it allowed a low-floor layout in a very short bus, and also came equipped with kneeling suspension for even greater access. Its styling and innovation led to a Millennium Products award and the Queen's Award for Innovation.\n\nIn 2000, Optare was bought by Hungarian owned North American Bus Industries (NABI). This gave Optare products exposure in the North American market, with an export version of the Solo finding success at several US airports and with Miami-Dade Transit in Florida.\n\nThe NABI era saw the introduction of the Alero low-floor minicoach in 2001, filling a gap in the market for a low floor vehicle for use on low intensity services such as demand responsive transport, already covered at the higher capacity by the Solo. In 2004 the new derivatives of Solo were introduced offering a longer variant and also a narrower 'SlimLine' model to further capture the market. Also introduced in 2004 was the first new bus model since the Solo, the Tempo, a full size single decker with another striking design, even when considered in the environment of increasingly stylish competitor products.\n\nOn 1 August 2005, NABI found itself in financial difficulties, and speculation about the future of Optare was ended with the announcement that Optare had, once again, been acquired by its management. This change did not affect the further roll out of the new range, leading to the Versa and a radically restyled Solo (the Solo SR), both with a distinctive raised part of the roofline towards the front of the bus.\n\nOn 12 March 2008, Optare was purchased by Jamesstan Investments, an investment company controlled by the Darwen Group's parent company chairman Ron Stanley. Optare initially remained an independent company but by 17 July 2008, a reverse takeover by Darwen Group had been completed. Darwen was the much smaller company, but its Alternative Investment Market listing saw the enlarged Optare gain a stock exchange listing itself as Optare plc. The combined business employs 830 people with a £90 million turnover.\n\nWith the respective histories of the two entities, Optare plc can be considered the successor company to the historical British bus manufacturers Charles H Roe (through Optare), founded in Leeds in 1923, and East Lancashire Coachbuilders, (through Darwen), founded in 1934 in Blackburn.\n\nThe Optare website was relaunched with a new logo, and with the ex East Lancs Olympus and Esteem models marketed as Optare products. At the time of merger, Optare manufactured buses from three sites, the primary sites being in Leeds (the former Leyland Bus site) and Blackburn (the former East Lancs site), with a further facility in Rotherham.\n\nThe merger brought together the single deck and midibus portfolio of Optare, with the primarily double deck order book of Darwen.\n\nAfter the merger, Optare began rationalisation of its bus manufacturing business. In 2009 the production of Esteem single-deck bodywork was ceased, and the manufacturing site at Rotherham was closed.\n\nIn summer 2010, Ashok Leyland (the former Indian subsidiary of British Leyland) bought a 26% stake in Optare. Subsequently, in December 2011 Ashok Leyland increased its stake to 75%.\n\nIn 2011, a new fully enclosed 13,000 m² factory opened Sherburn-in-Elmet replacing the Leeds plant. In 2012, the former East Lancs site also closed putting all manufacturing process under one roof. In June 2015, Optare was delisted from the Alternative Investment Market. In October 2017, Ashok Leyland increased its shareholding to 98%, and in 2018 to 99%.\n\nThe Optare parts and service division Unitec has locations at the former Rotherham factory, as well as in Thurrock, Essex.\n\nAs of 2008, the minicoach models Toro, Solera and Soroco were imported by Optare from the Spanish manufacturer Ferqui, and marketed as Optare products. They were luxury minicoach bodies built on Mercedes-Benz chassis, however, due to significantly reduced demand for mini and midi coaches, as part of its restructuring process, Optare took the decision to concentrate on its bus manufacturing activities and the relationship with Ferqui was formally ended in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Between 1968 and 1971 he attended Elam School of Art, gaining valuable wisdom and inspiration from teachers Robert Ellis, Pat Hanly, Colin McCahon, Garth Tapper and Greer Twiss. Brown first began exhibiting in 1972 and his highly praised Lemon Tree series (1977) helped to consolidate his position in the art scene.\n\nIn 1981, he was awarded a QEII Arts Council Grant for travel to the United States, the United Kingdom and Western Europe. On his return, the impact of the Springbok tour protests, as well as a period living with fellow neo-expressionist artist Philip Clairmont that same year, had a lasting impression on Brown. A founding member of the pressure group VAANA (Visual Artists Against Nuclear Arms) in 1984, Brown's paintings and prints of this period tackled relevant issues not only on nuclear weaponry but also on feminism and the peace movement. This culminated in his 1985 exhibition Living in the Bomb Age, at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery.\n\nBrown's practice examines his direct and personal articulation of the realities of the human condition. He is profoundly aware of the relationship between human beings and their environment. Symbolism such as the fern, black singlet, dog and driveway, James K. Baxter and Captain Cook, all reflect his experience, his observations and his beliefs. He has woven these into a complex web over a period of more than 40 years.\n\nIn his early work he combined a tension and personal narrative centred on social issues in New Zealand topography. His later work included the socio-political world of the distinctly New South Pacific, while in his current practice, he continues to emphasize his vision of a New Zealand identity.\n\nBrown has also undertaken two significant stained glass window designs – St Mary's Catholic Church, Auckland (1991) and Holy Trinity Cathedral, Parnell (1998). In 1998 he travelled to Antarctica as part of the inaugural 'Artist to Antarctica' programme.\n\nIn the 2004 New Year Honours, Brown was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to painting and printmaking, and in 2005 Brown was awarded a three-week residency in Russia hosted by the New Zealand ambassador in Moscow.\n\n"}
{"id": "1938323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938323", "title": "Overjustification effect", "text": "Overjustification effect\n\nThe overjustification effect occurs when an expected external incentive such as money or prizes decreases a person's intrinsic motivation to perform a task. Overjustification is an explanation for the phenomenon known as motivational \"crowding out.\" The overall effect of offering a reward for a previously unrewarded activity is a shift to extrinsic motivation and the undermining of pre-existing intrinsic motivation. Once rewards are no longer offered, interest in the activity is lost; prior intrinsic motivation does not return, and extrinsic rewards must be continuously offered as motivation to sustain the activity.\n\nThe overjustification effect has been widely demonstrated in many settings. In one of the earliest demonstrations of this effect, Edward Deci and his colleagues conducted a laboratory experiment in 1971 where subjects showing baseline interest in solving a puzzle were exposed to two different conditions. The control group were not paid on all three days while the experimental group were not paid on the first day, were paid on the second day and were not paid again on the third day. The subjects were given a break in the middle of each session and were being observed while doing whatever they wanted. The results showed that the experimental group spent significantly more time than the control group playing the puzzle during their break time on day 2 when they were paid but significantly less on day 3 when they were not paid. This was interpreted as evidence that the extrinsic monetary reward significantly reduced their intrinsic motivation to engage in the task.\n\nResearchers at Southern Methodist University conducted an experiment on 188 female university students in which they measured the subjects' continued interest in a cognitive task (a word game) after their initial performance under different incentives. The subjects were divided into two groups. Members of the first group were told that they would be rewarded for competence. Above-average players would be paid more and below-average players would be paid less. Members of the second group were told that they would be rewarded only for completion. Their pay was scaled by the number of repetitions or the number of hours playing. Afterwards, half of the subjects in each group were told that they over-performed, and the other half were told that they under-performed, regardless of how well each subject actually did. Members of the first group generally showed greater interest in the game and continued playing for a longer time than the members of the second group. \"Over-performers\" continued playing longer than \"under-performers\" in the first group, but \"under-performers\" continued playing longer than \"over-performers\" in the second group. This study showed that, when rewards do not reflect competence, higher rewards lead to less intrinsic motivation. But when rewards do reflect competence, higher rewards lead to greater intrinsic motivation.\n\nRichard Titmuss suggested that paying for blood donations might reduce the supply of blood donors. To test this, a field experiment with three treatments was conducted. In the first treatment, the donors did not receive compensation. In the second treatment, the donors received a small payment. In the third treatment, donors were given a choice between the payment and an equivalent-valued contribution to charity. None of the three treatments affected the number of male donors, but the second treatment almost halved the number of female donors. However, allowing the contribution to charity fully eliminated this effect.\n\nAccording to self-perception theory, a person infers causes about his or her own behavior based on external constraints. The presence of a strong constraint (such as a reward) would lead a person to conclude that he or she is performing the behavior solely for the reward, which shifts the person's motivation from intrinsic to extrinsic.\n\nLaboratory studies in the 1970s indicated that individuals under conditions with extrinsic rewards showed diminished intrinsic motivation. Deci and his colleagues (e.g., Deci and Ryan 1985) developed the cognitive evaluation theory to explain the results. As a sub-theory of self-determination theory, cognitive evaluation theory explains that both control and competence underlie intrinsic motivation and how extrinsic rewards affect intrinsic motivation is dependent on the individual's interpretation. Intrinsic motivation increases if individuals interpret rewards as pertaining positive information about their own competence and self-control over results, whereas if they interpret the results as indicative of external control, this decreases their feelings of self-control and competence, which in turn decreases intrinsic motivation. Cognitive evaluation theory also suggests social context as another implication on intrinsic motivation. Social cues can exert either positive or negative effects on intrinsic motivation depending on the messages that the context conveys regarding a person's autonomy and competence. Verbal rewards such as positive feedback and praise are predicted to be experienced as controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation. However, verbal rewards that are informational and not experienced as controlling are predicted to exert positive effects.\n\nSelf-determination theory is a broad theory of motivation in work organizations that maintains the predictions of cognitive evaluation theory but also recognizes the limitations of the theory, such as organizational conditions under which predictions do not apply or are less relevant in real-world settings, which cognitive evaluation theory fails to recognize. The theory differentiates between various types of motivational states, distinguishes the organizational conditions where extrinsic rewards are more effective than intrinsic rewards, examines individual differences in orientation toward intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation and discusses managerial behavior that can enhance intrinsic motivation. Findings from the Deci et al. (1989) study have supported self-determination theory as an approach to work motivation by showing how managers can impact the work attitudes of their employees. The study reported that managerial autonomy support which included provision of options, giving relevant information in a non-autonomous way, acknowledging subordinates' perspectives and cultivating self-initiation resulted in employees having more positive work-related attitudes such as higher level of job satisfaction and increased level of trust in corporate management.\n\n The overjustification effect is controversial because it challenges previous findings in psychology on the general effectiveness of reinforcement on increasing behavior, and also the widespread practice of using incentives in the classroom. These findings fail to account for situations whereby the nature of activities differ, such as in cases where the initial level of intrinsic interest in the activity is very low, introducing extrinsic contingencies may be essential for producing involvement. These conclusions were challenged in a separate meta-analysis which found that tangible rewards offered for outperforming others and for performing uninteresting tasks (in which intrinsic motivation is low) lead to increased intrinsic motivation, and stated that the detrimental effects of rewards on motivation only occur in a specific, restricted set of conditions that could be easily avoided. This set of analyses included both high-interest and low-interest tasks, whereas the original meta-analyses conducted by Deci and colleagues (1999) restricted analyses to tasks in which participants initially had high interest. In fact, a 2001 meta-analysis showed that rewards can increase intrinsic motivation for tasks that initially hold little intrinsic interest.\n\nAlso, according to Eisenberger and Cameron, claimed negative effects of extrinsic rewards on task interest derived from the Deci study (1971) do not take into consideration that conditions manufactured in laboratory settings that produce these effects are not true reflections of situations in the real world. For example, in the Deci study the incentive was provided for one session and was then arbitrarily withdrawn in the next and such incentive plans do not exist in the real world. Also, the reduced intrinsic interest seen in subjects may be explained by a negative reaction when the reward was withheld.\nEisenberger and his colleges also claimed that the validity of the dependent measure is highly questionable in the Deci study. Laboratory results that used the amount of free time spend on the task as the dependent measure are shown to be far weaker than when self reports are used for these measures. The Deci study gives far less weight to self reports, however self-reports about subjects' level of internal motivation seem to be a more direct measure of the psychological state of interest.\n\nConsiderable research has also shown that rewards tend to enhance feelings of competence and autonomy and high standards, pressure and competitiveness are able to increase these effects. For example, employees view earning incentives as enjoyable rather than a dreaded tool of management control. These findings are in contrast with the psychological mechanism for effects that Deci and his colleges had claimed in the past. Also in the past 30 years, notable academic reviews of rewards have confirmed that monetary incentives have shown to significantly increase performance.\nAdditionally, some activities require a significant level of mastery or engagement before its attractiveness becomes apparent to an individual, in such cases external incentives may be useful to build individuals up to that level. Token economy programs represent one example in which there is evidence showing that such programs have successfully implemented extrinsic rewards to increase interest in certain broad classes of activities.\n\nThere are also differences in effect among the different age groups. According to Deci et al. (1999), the negative effects extrinsic contingencies have on intrinsic motivation seem to be more severe for children than college students. One possible explanation is that college students have greater cognitive capacity, enabling them to better separate informational and controlling aspects of rewards. Hence they are able to interpret rewards as indicators of effective performance rather than controlling their behavior, which causes them to operate with performance-goal orientations. It is therefore speculated that such differences are far greater between children and employed workers.\n\nA rebuttal defended the original findings, concluding that this analysis by Cameron (2001) was flawed and that Cameron's inclusion of boring tasks in analyzing potential overjustification effects made little theoretical or practical sense. This rebuttal argued that cognitive evaluation theory is the most consistent structure for explaining the effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation, pointing to several other papers that have supported the theory.\n\nFindings from the Lepper et al.'s (1973) study suggest that presenting these extrinsic rewards poses central problems in the schooling system in that it fails to preserve the intrinsic interest in learning and exploration that a child may seem to possess during his initial phase in school. This also has severe ramifications on the education system, as it seems to almost undermine children's spontaneous interest in the process of learning itself, instead their motivation is driven by these extrinsic rewards. Research in this area suggests that parents and educators should rely on intrinsic motivation and preserve feelings of autonomy and competence as much as possible. When the task is unattractive and intrinsic motivation is insufficient (e.g., household chores), then extrinsic rewards are useful to provide incentives for behavior.\n\nSchool programs that provide money or prizes for reading books have been criticized for their potential to reduce intrinsic motivation by overjustification. However, a study of the Pizza Hut program, Book It!, found that participation in the program neither increased nor decreased reading motivation. Although motivating students to read by rewarding them may undermine their interest in reading, it may also encourage the reading skills necessary for developing an interest in reading.\n\nCognitive evaluation theory further predicts the different types of rewards that will exert different effects. According to the theory, task non-contingent rewards like benefits that are based on things other than performance, such as employment that do not consist any information regarding autonomy and competence, will have no effect on intrinsic motivation. Task contingent rewards on the other hand like salary which are awarded for performing or completing a task, will be experienced as controlling and hence will have a negative effect on intrinsic motivation. The study conducted by Deckop and Cirka (2000) reported that introducing merit pay programs in a non-profit organization led to decreased feelings of autonomy and intrinsic motivation, indicating that rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation in work settings.\n\nPerformance contingent rewards like monetary incentives that are given for good performance or meeting a certain standard will be experienced as highly controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation. The Shirom, Westman, and Melamed (1999) study found that pay-for-performance plans resulted in lower well being in blue-collar workers, and this was especially evident for those who felt that their jobs were monotonous. However, in certain cases where the reward also conveys information about competence that will in turn reduce the negative effect.\n\nThe term gamification refers to the application of game design elements to non-game contexts in order to drive participation, often with the goal of encouraging greater engagement with the non-game context by providing symbolic rewards such as points, badges, or virtual currency. However, a number of academics and other critics have expressed concern that these rewards may backfire via the overjustification effect. Drawing directly on self-determination theory, these critics of gamification express concerns that gamified contexts such as foursquare might provide expected rewards for activities that do not adequately meet self-determination theory's three innate needs for intrinsic motivation—relatedness, autonomy, and competence—and therefore reduce intrinsic interest in those activities.\n\nWebsites that rely on user-generated content sometimes offer monetary rewards for contributions, but these may cause the contributors to succumb to the overjustification effect and stop contributing. For example, Amazon Mechanical Turk allows the creator of a task to offer a monetary reward, but a survey of 431 Mechanical Turk participants showed that they are driven more by intrinsic motivations than a desire for the usually meager monetary compensation. The overjustification effect was also considered in a study on how to maximize contributions when crowdsourcing creative endeavors.\n\nEmpirical evidence shows that expected financial rewards \"crowd out\" intrinsic motivation, while the size of the monetary reward simultaneously provides extrinsic motivation. If the size of the monetary reward is not large enough to compensate for the loss of intrinsic motivation, overall engagement can decline. A survey data-set revealed that small financial payments reduced volunteer hours among Swiss citizens, and that the median financial reward provided to these volunteers caused them to work less than volunteers who were not given any payment.\n\nThe overjustification effect has also been linked to professional sports. The performance of numerous athletes has diminished following the signing of a lucrative, multimillion-dollar contract. Some notable professional athletes whose performances have diminished following a large contract include Alex Rodriguez (MLB), Albert Pujols (MLB), Wayne Rooney (Premier League) and Albert Haynesworth (NFL).\n\n\n"}

It is composed of four MCs; Ryo-Z, Ilmari, Pes & Su and a DJ, Fumiya. Their sound derives its influences from old school hip hop and other hip hop such as The Pharcyde, De La Soul, Public Enemy, Jurassic 5, the Beastie Boys, DJ Premier and Leaders of the New School.\n\nTo date they have released six indie singles with 17 major singles. They have also released two indie albums, ten major albums, one live album, one indies collection and three best-of albums.\n\nOn October 31 2018 the group announced that they were suspending all activities following a cheating allegation against Su. Their website has since shut down.\n\n\nThe group was formed in 1994 by Ryo-Z and Ilmari, who were later joined by Pes (he attended the same school as Ilmari). The Rip in Rip Slyme stands for their initials. Slyme was a popular children's toy at that time. Their name is also a pun on the phrase \"lips' rhyme\". Winning an amateur rapping contest \"Young MCs In Town\", they started their musical career with their first album \"Lips Rhyme\" in 1995. Later they added DJ Fumiya (who had studied under East End X Yuri's DJ Yoggy) and Su (previously a backup dancer for East End X Yuri). In 1998 they released their second album, \"Talkin' Cheap\" and also took part in Dragon Ash's Total Communication event.\n\nBecoming more successful, they signed to Warner Music Group in 2000. By then they had released several indie singles including their EP \"Underline No. 5\" and \"Mata Au Hi Made\" which had received the help of Fantastic Plastic Machine. \"Mata Au Hi Made\" was released on Warner Music Group's Indies label. Their first major single was \"Stepper's Delight\" released 22 March 2001. The title was a play on The Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\".\n\nIn general, Fumiya composes most of the music, while Ryo-Z, Pes, Ilmari, and Su write their own lyrics. However, before Fumiya became a member, Pes composed most of the songs. Each member has tried their hand at composing music for Rip Slyme, and Pes occasionally plays guitar on some tracks (Such as Home and More & More, for example). Allegedly, Pes was in a rock band before being introduced to hip hop music by Ilmari and Ryo-Z.\n\nIn 2002, they received MTV Video Music Awards Japan for \"Best Newcomer\" and \"Best Hip-hop Group\".\n\nThe same year they released a big-budget album \"Tokyo Classic\", which became Japan's first million-selling hip-hop album, with a sound compared to James Brown's soul and funk. Two singles from the album, \"Funkastic\" and \"Rakuen Baby\" collected MTV awards in 2003. \"Super Shooter\", featured as a B-side to their\nsingle \"Galaxy\", is the theme song for the anime \"Gantz\".\n\nFrom late 2005 (after the release of \"Good Job!\" in August) through 2006, DJ Fumiya was on extended break, citing illness. For performances, a friend of the band, DJ Soma, was a stand-in. Fumiya's break led to several interesting side projects and collaborations from other members. Fumiya returned to activity for concerts in late summer 2006, and for the Rip Slyme release, \"Epoch\".\n\nOn 7 July 2007, Rip Slyme performed their single \"Nettaiya\" at Live Earth in Kyoto, Japan. Later that year, they would go on to release their fifteenth major single, \"Speed King\", and their seventh Warner album, \"Funfair\", shortly after.\n\nIn summer 2008, they released \"Taiyou to Bikini\". Later that year, three digital singles would debut, all of which would be on the February 2009 single \"Stairs\". Rip Slyme released their eighth album, \"Journey\", on June 10, 2009.\n\nRip Slyme has provided voiceover work as well as the ending theme for an episode of the Japanese dub of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". The episode aired on May 6, 2009.\n\nIn 2010, Rip Slyme was one of the artists launched on Warner Music's new sublabel, unBORDE.\n\nIlmari formed a short lived group with Kj and BOTS of Dragon Ash, and Shigeo of Skebo King called Steady & Co.. The group released their debut album \"Chambers\" in 2001. Ilmari and Ryo-Z along with Wise, Verbal of M-Flo, and Nigo the founder of A Bathing Ape formed a super group known as Teriyaki Boyz. The Teriyaki Boyz released two albums: \"Beef or Chicken\" (2005) and \"Serious Japanese\" (2009). In 2012 Ilmari formed a Hip-Hop/Rock band named The Beatmoss with Kosen, Yas, and Sohnosuke. The group released two albums: \"The Beatmoss Vol. 1\" (2012) and \"The Beatmoss Vol. 2\" (2013).

He has won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album twice. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked C.K.'s stand-up special \"Shameless\" number three on their \"Divine Comedy: 25 Best Stand-Up Specials and Movies of All Time\" list and ranked him fourth on its 2017 list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.\n\nC.K. began his career in the 1990s writing for comedians including David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, Dana Carvey, Chris Rock, and \"Saturday Night Live\". He was also directing surreal short films and directed two features—\"Tomorrow Night\" (1998) and \"Pootie Tang\" (2001).\nIn 2001, C.K. released his debut comedy album, \"Live in Houston\", directly through his website and became among the first performers to offer direct-to-fan sales of tickets to his stand-up shows and DRM-free video concert downloads via his website. He has released nine comedy albums, often directing and editing his specials as well.\n\nHe had supporting acting roles in the acclaimed films such as David O. Russell's \"American Hustle\", Woody Allen's \"Blue Jasmine\" (both 2013), and the Hollywood blacklist drama \"Trumbo\" (2015). C.K. created, directed and starred in \"Louie\", an acclaimed Emmy Award winning semi-autobiographical comedy-drama series aired from 2010 to 2015 on FX. In 2016, C.K. created and starred in his self-funded web series \"Horace and Pete\". He also co-created the shows \"Baskets\" and \"Better Things\" for FX and voiced the protagonist Max in the animated film \"The Secret Life of Pets\" in the same year.\n\nIn 2017 he admitted to several incidents of sexual misconduct. This resulted in widespread criticism and caused his 2017 film \"I Love You, Daddy\" to be pulled from distribution prior to its release, a halt in his stand-up career, and many significant professional repercussions.\n\nIn 2018 he returned to stand-up comedy and in 2019 announced an international tour. In 2020, C.K. released his comeback special, \"Sincerely Louis C.K.\" on his website.\n\nC.K. was born Louis Székely in Washington, D.C. on September 12, 1967, the son of software engineer Mary Louise (\"née\" Davis) and economist Luis Székely. His parents met at Harvard University, where his mother was completing her degree in a summer school program. They were married at St. Francis Church in Traverse City, Michigan. C.K. has three sisters. C.K.'s father is of Mexican and Hungarian descent. C.K.'s Jewish grandfather, Géza Székely Schweiger, had immigrated from Hungary to Mexico. C.K.'s mother, an American with Irish ancestry, grew up on a farm in Michigan. She graduated from Owosso High School in Owosso, Michigan. She attended University of Michigan and graduated from Ohio State University Phi Beta Kappa. C.K.'s maternal grandparents were M. Louise Davis and Alfred C. Davis.\n\nWhen C.K. was a year old, his family moved to his father's home country of Mexico, where his father had earned a degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico prior to graduating from Harvard. C.K.'s first language was Spanish; it was not until after they moved back to the U.S. when he was seven that he began to learn English. He has said that he has since forgotten much of his Spanish. When C.K. left Mexico with his family, they moved back to the United States and settled in Boston.\n\nUpon moving from Mexico to suburban Boston, C.K. wanted to become a writer and comedian, citing Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Woody Allen, and George Carlin as some of his influences. When he was 10, his parents divorced. C.K. said that his father was around but he did not see him much and when he remarried, C.K.'s father converted to Orthodox Judaism, the faith of his new wife. C.K. and his three sisters were raised by their single mother in Newton, Massachusetts. The fact that his mother had only \"bad\" TV shows to view upon returning home from work inspired him to work on television. C.K.'s mother raised her children as Catholic and they attended after-school Catholic class until they completed communion. C.K. has said that his father's whole family still lives in Mexico. C.K.'s paternal uncle Dr. Francisco Székely is an academic and an international consultant on environmental affairs who served as Mexico's Deputy Minister of Environment (2000–2003).\n\nC.K. attended Newton North High School, and graduated in 1985. He graduated with future \"Friends\" star Matt LeBlanc. After graduation, C.K. worked as an auto mechanic and at a public access TV cable station in Boston. According to C.K., working in public access TV gave him the tools and technical knowledge to make his short films and later his television shows. \"Learning is my favorite thing\", he said. He also worked for a time as a cook and in a video store.\n\nIn 1984, C.K. at 17 directed the comedic short film \"Trash Day\". The New York University Tisch School of the Arts showed an interest in him as a filmmaker, but he instead decided to pursue a career in stand-up comedy. C.K.'s first attempt at stand-up was in 1985 at an open mic night at a comedy club in Boston, Massachusetts, during the apex of the comedy boom. He was given five minutes of time, but had only two minutes of material. He was so discouraged by the experience that he did not perform again for two years. As Boston's comedy scene grew, C.K. gradually achieved success, performing alongside acts such as Denis Leary and Lenny Clarke, and eventually he moved up to paid gigs, opening for Jerry Seinfeld and hosting comedy clubs until he moved to Manhattan in 1989. He performed his act on many televised programs, including \"Evening at the Improv\" and \"Star Search\". C.K.'s short film \"Ice Cream\" (1993), was submitted to the Aspen Shortsfest in 1994.\n\nIn 1993, he unsuccessfully auditioned for \"Saturday Night Live\", although he did later work with Robert Smigel, writing on the \"TV Funhouse\" shorts for the program. C.K.'s earliest writing job was for Conan O'Brien on the late-night talk show \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" from 1993 to 1994, before briefly writing for \"Late Show with David Letterman\" in 1995. C.K. has stated that Conan O'Brien kept C.K. in comedy by hiring him, as he planned to quit comedy the following day if he had not been hired for \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nThroughout the spring of 1996, C.K. served as the head writer for \"The Dana Carvey Show\"; its writers also included Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, Robert Smigel, and Charlie Kaufman. It was cancelled after seven episodes. In 1996, HBO released his first half-hour comedy special. C.K. appeared several times on the animated show \"Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist\".\n\nFrom 1997 to 1999, he wrote for \"The Chris Rock Show\". His work for on the show was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for writing three times, winning \"Best Writing in a Variety or Comedy Series\" in 1999. He was also nominated for an Emmy for his work writing for \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". He has been quoted as describing his approach to writing as a \"deconstruction\" that is both painful and frightening.\n\nIn 1998, C.K. wrote and directed the independent black-and-white film \"Tomorrow Night\", which premiered at Sundance, marking his feature film directorial debut after making several shorter films, including six short films for the sketch comedy show \"Howie Mandel's Sunny Skies\" (1995) on the Showtime cable network. C.K. self-released \"Tomorrow Night\" in 2014. He hosted the PBS show \"ShortCuts\" in 1999, which featured independent short films, including some made by C.K. himself. Also that year, C.K. devised and starred in \"The Filthy Stupid Talent Show\", a mock talent show television special. He had an early acting role in the independent comedy \"Tuna\", alongside Nick Offerman, in 2000 and performed on the stand-up showcase series \"Comedy Central Presents\" the following year.\n\nC.K. wrote and directed the feature film \"Pootie Tang\" (2001), which was adapted from a sketch that was featured on \"The Chris Rock Show\" and featured Chris Rock in a supporting role. The film received largely negative reviews from critics, but has become a cult classic; in a half-star review, Roger Ebert declared it a \"train wreck\" and felt the film was \"not in a releasable condition\". Though C.K. is credited as the director, he was fired at the end of filming with the film being re-edited by the studio. C.K. has since co-written two screenplays with Rock: \"Down to Earth\" (2001) and \"I Think I Love My Wife\" (2007). His first comedy album, \"Live in Houston\", was released in 2001. In 2002, he voiced Brendon Small's estranged father, Andrew Small, in the animated sitcom \"Home Movies\". C.K. was among the writing staff of the sketch comedy show \"Cedric the Entertainer Presents\" (2002–03).\n\nIn August 2005, C.K. starred in a half-hour HBO special as part of the stand-up series \"One Night Stand\". Inspired by the work ethic of fellow comedian George Carlin, who had committed to dropping all of his existing material and starting over every year, In June 2006, C.K. starred in and wrote \"Lucky Louie\", a sitcom he created. The series premiered on HBO and was videotaped in front of a studio audience; it was HBO's first series in that format. \"Lucky Louie\" is described as a bluntly realistic portrayal of family life. HBO canceled the series after its first season. C.K. was also a part of Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour with other comedians in 2007. In 2007, he hosted a three-hour phone-in show on the service at the request of Opie & Anthony, during which he advised callers on their relationship troubles. During an interview with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on the show, C.K. repeatedly asked Rumsfeld whether he is in fact a reptilian space alien who \"eats Mexican babies\". Rumsfeld declined to comment and the video has since gone viral.\n\nHe appeared in three films in 2008: \"Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins\", \"Diminished Capacity\", and \"Role Models\". C.K. launched his first hour-long special, \"Shameless\", in 2007, which aired on HBO and was later released on DVD. In March 2008, he recorded a second hour-long special, \"Chewed Up\", which premiered on Showtime Network on October 4, 2008, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy or Variety Special.\n\nC.K. and his wife Alix Bailey divorced in 2008, with C.K. and Bailey sharing joint custody of their children. In a 2010 interview, C.K. talked about how, after his divorce, he thought, \"well, there goes my act.\" He alluded to the way that his marriage had been central to his act and his life, and he said that it took him approximately a year to realize \"I'm accumulating stories here that are worth telling.\" One element in his preparation for stand-up was training at the same boxing gym as Lowell, Massachusetts fighter Micky Ward, trying to \"learn how to ... do the grunt work and the boring, constant training so that you'll be fit enough to take the beating.\"\n\nOn April 18, 2009, C.K. recorded a concert film titled \"Hilarious\". Unlike his previous specials—which had all been produced for television networks—\"Hilarious\" was produced independently, directed by C.K. himself, and sold to Epix and Comedy Central after it was complete. As a result, it was not released until late 2010. It was published on DVD and CD in 2011. It is the first stand-up comedy film accepted into the Sundance Film Festival. From 2009 to 2012, C.K. played Dave Sanderson, a police officer and ex-boyfriend of Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) in the sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\". He also co-starred in the romantic comedy fantasy film \"The Invention of Lying\", directed by and starring Ricky Gervais, in 2009.\nFX picked up C.K.'s series \"Louie\" in August 2009, which C.K. stars in, writes, directs, and edits. The show features stand-up routines blended with segments partially based on his offstage experiences which address his life as a divorced, aging father. The show premiered on June 29, 2010. In season three, episodes dealt respectively with a date with an unstable bookshop clerk (played by Parker Posey); a doomed attempt to replace a retiring David Letterman; an aborted visit to C.K.'s father; and a dream-reality New Year's Eve episode in which C.K. ends up in China. These episodes were ranked in critic Matt Zoller Seitz's favorite 25 comedy episodes of 2012. Seitz called the episode \"New Year's Eve\" \"truly audacious\". C.K. has been nominated five times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series (2011–2015) for his work in \"Louie\" and won two Emmys in 2011 for the \"Louie\" episode \"Pregnant\" and for his special \"Live at the Beacon Theater\".\n\nThe show was renewed for a fourth season; with a 19-month hiatus after season 3 to accommodate C.K.'s roles in David O. Russell's \"American Hustle\" and Woody Allen's \"Blue Jasmine\" in 2013. During the 2014 Television Critics Association presentations, FX Networks' John Landgraf reported that \"Louie\" would return in spring 2015 for a shortened fifth season of seven episodes—compared to the 13 episodes of prior seasons. The fifth season premiered in April 2015 and an announcement said the series would take an \"extended hiatus\" in August 2015; C.K. stated in January 2016 that he \"just doesn't know\" whether it would return or not. In November 2017, in the wake of the misconduct allegations against C.K, FX cut ties with the embattled comic and filmmaker, ending their partnership. In 2018, however, FX CEO John Landgraf stated to Variety, “I love ‘Louie’ and I love Louis C.K.'s work and I miss him, and I miss it,” and that \"the network is ready to welcome C.K. back and is eager for “Louie” season six\".\n\nOn December 10, 2011, C.K. released his fourth full-length special, \"Live at the Beacon Theater\". Like \"Hilarious\", it was produced independently and directed by C.K. However, unlike his earlier work, it was distributed digitally on his website, foregoing both physical and broadcast media. C.K. released the special for $5.00 and without DRM, hoping that these factors and the direct relationship between the artist and consumer would effectively deter illegal downloading. At the end of the special, the release of a new album, recorded at Carnegie Hall the previous year, is mentioned. By December 21, 2011, the sales of the special from C.K.'s website had already earned him over $1 million. C.K. hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" on November 3, 2012 and was subsequently Primetime Emmy Award-nominated for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nThe success of the special prompted other comedians, including Jim Gaffigan, Joe Rogan, and Aziz Ansari, to release their own specials with a similar business model. On May 11, 2012, C.K. additionally made two audio-only downloads available for $5.00 each: \"\" (and the audio version of his first HBO stand-up special, \"Shameless\"), as well as an audio-only version of \"Live at the Beacon Theater\". C.K.'s fifth one-hour special, \"Oh My God\", was recorded at the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona, and premiered on HBO April 13, 2013. It was also sold and distributed using the same model as C.K. used for \"Live at the Beacon Theater\".\nIn 2013, C.K. appeared in critically acclaimed films the first being Woody Allen's \"Blue Jasmine\" where he played the romantic interest of Sally Hawkins' character. C.K. originally auditioned for the role that went to Andrew Dice Clay, and Allen offered Louie the role that ended up in the film. Of the experience C.K. stated, “I had this three-day part and I figured I’m a tourist on this movie. All I want is a little Woody moment to take home with me. It was so fun, and we had lunch, and I thought having lunch with him was my rewarding moment. And then after lunch, we shot one more scene and I got a big laugh on the set, and I thought, that’s my Woody moment\".\n\nLater that year, C.K. starred in David O. Russell's black comedy crime film \"American Hustle\", which was released in December 2013. C.K. played the role of FBI supervisor Stoddard Thorsen, the boss of Bradley Cooper's character. The film was a financial and critical hit, earning 10 Academy Awards nominations including Best Picture. C.K. earned a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\nC.K.'s production company, Pig Newton, where he works with producer Blair Breard, signed a contract to develop and executive produce pilots for FX Networks in 2013. In January 2014, an announcement said C.K. would produce and co-write a Zach Galifianakis-created comedy pilot for FX Networks. The 10-episode single-camera comedy, titled \"Baskets\", premiered on January 21, 2016. It features Galifianakis as the main character, a struggling clown named Chip Baskets in a pilot episode written by Galifianakis, Louis C.K. and Jonathan Krisel. C.K. released his sixth one-hour special \"Live at the Comedy Store\" to his website in January 2015, which, unlike his past few specials, was recorded at a club, The Comedy Store in West Hollywood. C.K. said he intended the material as an exercise in creating an act that hearkened back to his early days in comedy clubs. The special premiered exclusively on FX on May 28, 2015.\n\nHe returned to host Saturday Night Live on March 29, 2014 and May 16, 2015 and received Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for both episodes. C.K. also attended the \"Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special\", where he was chosen to introduce a montage of the pre-recorded sketches.\n\nIn May 2015, it was announced that C.K. would write, direct, and star in the film \"I'm a Cop\", to be produced by Scott Rudin, Dave Becky, and Blair Breard, with a budget of $8 million, although he later canceled the project. C.K. became the first comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden three times in a single tour in 2015. Audio from the tour was released by C.K. on his website as \"Louis C.K.: Live at Madison Square Garden\" through the pay what you want model. In November 2015, C.K co-starred in the biographical drama film \"Trumbo\" as a composite character based on five different screenwriters who were blacklisted in Hollywood for their alleged ties to the Communist party during the 1940s.\n\nHe executive-produced the pilot for the Amazon Video black comedy series \"One Mississippi\", starring Notaro, in November 2015. It was ordered for a full season by Amazon.\n\nThe media announced in January 2016 that C.K. and actor/comedian Albert Brooks would create, write, executive produce, and provide the voices for the two main characters in an animated series pilot for FX. The following January, the series was announced to instead be premiering on TBS in 2018 and is titled \"The Cops\", following two Los Angeles patrolmen. On January 30, 2016, he released the first episode of the tragicomic drama series \"Horace and Pete\" to his website, without any prior announcements. C.K. directed, wrote, and starred in the series as bar owner Horace, alongside Steve Buscemi, who portrays co-owner Pete. \"Horace and Pete\" pioneered the genre of 'sadcom'. James Poniewozik of \"The New York Times\" said the series \"may best be described as a \"Cheers\" spec script by Eugene O'Neill: a snapshot of a family—and a country—suffering a hangover decades in the making.\" The self-financed series received a significantly positive reaction from critics, who largely focused on the performances of the veteran cast that includes C.K., Buscemi, Edie Falco, Steven Wright, Alan Alda, and Jessica Lange and C.K.'s writing. C.K. has expressed his interest in a second season. C.K. next voiced the lead, Max, a Jack Russell Terrier, in the animated comedy film \"The Secret Life of Pets\". The film was co-directed by Chris Renaud of the \"Despicable Me\" series, and was released on July 8, 2016. It grossed over $875 million worldwide. C.K. developed the series \"Better Things\" with its star Pamela Adlon, who had appeared on \"Louie\". C.K. co-wrote, co-produced, and directed the pilot. The show is about a single working actress mother and her struggles to raise three daughters. It premiered in September 2016 on FX. His stand-up special \"2017\" was filmed in Washington, D.C. and released on April 4, 2017, through the streaming service Netflix.\n\nBarry Crimmins's stand-up special, \"Whatever Threatens You\", directed and produced by C.K., was released through his website in 2016.\n\nOn April 8, 2017, he hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" for a fourth time, where he received strong reviews for his opening monologue which in which he tackled white privilege, and bits about a racist chicken, and talking animals. A critic from \"The A.V. Club\" wrote \" no one's better at taking a joke to the edge and tiptoeing nimbly along it\". C.K. also honored fellow comedian Don Rickles who died that week, saying during the goodnights portion stating, \"I just want to say, Don Rickles was the funniest man in the world and he was also a lovely, beautiful guy. I'll miss him for the rest of my life\".\n\nC.K. directed the film \"I Love You, Daddy\" in secret, shooting entirely on black and white 35 mm film in June 2017. The film follows a television producer and writer played by C.K. called Glen Topher whose teenage daughter, played by Chloë Grace Moretz, is seduced by a much older film director (John Malkovich), causing Topher to become disconcerted. The film also features Charlie Day, Adlon, Rose Byrne, Edie Falco and Helen Hunt. It premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival in September, whereupon \"The Guardian\" film critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film a four-star review, calling it a \"very funny and recklessly provocative homage to Woody Allen, channeling his masterpiece \"Manhattan\".\"\n\nIn 2015, rumors about C.K.'s personal life began to appear on various websites, starting with comedian Roseanne Barr, who told \"The Daily Beast\" in an interview that she had heard stories of C.K., \"locking the door and masturbating in front of women comics and writers\". Barr added in a subsequent tweet that she had no idea if C.K. was a sexual offender or not, but said that given the number of accusations, he should address the rumors. Two years later, in a September 2017 \"Vanity Fair\" interview, comedian Tig Notaro announced that she was cutting ties with C.K., a one-time collaborator and producer on her show \"One Mississippi\", saying that he should address the rumors of sexual impropriety, and alluding to an unspecified \"incident\" between herself and C.K. C.K. dismissed these allegations in a September 2017 \"New York Times\" interview, saying \"They're rumors, that's all that is. I don't know why she said the things she's said, I really don't. I don't think talking about that stuff in the press and having conversations over press lanes is a good idea.\"\n\nOn November 9, 2017, The Orchard, distributor of C.K.'s upcoming film \"I Love You, Daddy\", canceled the New York premiere of the film due to \"unexpected circumstances\", while a scheduled appearance by C.K. on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" promoting the movie was also canceled. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ran an article claiming that a very damaging story on the comedian was about to be published in the \"New York Times\", and the premiere was canceled to mitigate the damage. Later that day, the \"Times\" did indeed publish allegations of sexual harassment against C.K. by five women. These included comedy duo Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov, who claimed that they had been invited to C.K.'s hotel room in 2002 during the US Comedy Arts Festival, where he asked them if he could masturbate in front of them. In their account, CK then began masturbating. The story claimed the two women were laughing at C.K.'s behaviour, and then they left the hotel room and called ImprovOlympics founder Charna Halpern and relayed the experience. The article included a separate allegation from comedian Abby Schachner who said that during a 2003 phone conversation C.K. had complimented her appearance before she heard him begin to masturbate. In another instance, comedian Rebecca Corry described how, on the set of a television pilot in 2005, C.K. had asked for permission to accompany her to her dressing room so that he could masturbate in front of her. Corry and Schachner both added that C.K. reached out to them several years later and apologized for this past behavior.\n\nC.K. initially declined to answer the allegations in public. In a subsequent statement on November 10, after the \"Times\" article, C.K. admitted to behavior that he initially thought \"was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first\", and went on to express remorse stating, \"the power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly\". Later that week, one of C.K.'s managers, Dave Becky, dropped C.K. as a client and apologized for a perceived \"cover up\".\n\nIn the wake of the scandal, C.K suffered repercussions. The Orchard announced it would not distribute the film \"I Love You, Daddy\", and co-stars Chloë Grace Moretz and Charlie Day said they would not participate in the film's promotion. FX Networks announced it was cutting ties with C.K., and Netflix announced that it would not be moving forward with a second planned stand-up special featuring the comedian. HBO dropped C.K.'s appearance on an upcoming \"Night of Too Many Stars\" autism television special and removed his content from their on-demand services. TBS suspended production of, and eventually scrapped its animated series \"The Cops\". Illumination, about to produce the animated children's film \"The Secret Life of Pets 2\" in which C.K. was to reprise his starring role from the previous film, terminated their relationship with him and hired Patton Oswalt as his replacement. The Disney Channel also removed C.K. from reruns of \"Gravity Falls\", redubbing his character's voice with series creator Alex Hirsch. C.K. stated in 2018 that the fallout from the scandal had taken him through \"hell and back\" and cost him approximately $35 million in lost income.\n\nOn August 26, 2018, C.K. made an unannounced appearance at the Comedy Cellar in Manhattan, New York. It was reported that he received an ovation from the audience, and performed a typical set making no reference to the sexual controversy.\n\nHis return to stand-up comedy was criticized by comedians including Aparna Nancherla, Ian Karmel, Allie Goertz and Judd Apatow as being premature, whereas Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Michael Che, Jim Gaffigan, Janeane Garofalo, Marlon Wayans, Joe Rogan, Kurt Metzger and Sarah Silverman supported C.K.'s right to continue standup. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld also supported C.K.'s return to standup but opined that the public may have felt that C.K had not owned up to his actions enough, saying in October 2018, \"We know the routine: The person does something wrong. The person's humiliated. They're exiled. They suffer, we want them to suffer. We love the tumble, we love the crash and bang of the fall. And then we love the crawl-back. The grovel. Are you going to grovel? How long are you going to grovel?\" Seinfeld added, \"We, the court of public opinion, decided if he's going to come back, he'd better show a lot of pain. Because he denied (the public) that.\" Edie Falco, who starred in C.K.'s \"Horace and Pete\" and \"I Love You, Daddy\", expressed her hope that he would receive a second chance saying: \"He's someone who admitted that he did what he was accused of doing and admitted that it wasn't right\" and that \"people who are committed to becoming aware of what they've done and changing, they can be our strongest proponents in an issue like this.\"\n\nOn December 31, 2018, an audience member secretly recorded C.K. working out new material and posted it online. The comedy set included controversial topics such as Auschwitz, non-binary people and victims of the 2018 Parkland shooting. The jokes drew condemnation from Parkland survivors and a divided reaction from fellow comedians. Ricky Gervais defended C.K.'s jokes saying \"[C.K.’s] got nothing against those [Parkland] kids. It was him pretending to be angry for comedy.\"\n\nIn October 2019, C.K. announced in an e-mail to subscribers of his website an international tour of his new material. Following the leak of his new material in December 2018, his future shows would require audience members to lock cell phones and other devices in Yondr cases.\n\nIn January 2020, C.K. performed an unannounced set, receiving a standing ovation for the eighth annual benefit show for late comedian Patrice O'Neal, a yearly benefit in which comedian Bill Burr is the organizer.\n\nOn April 4, 2020, C.K. released a new stand-up special titled \"Sincerely Louis C.K.\" through his website without advance notice. In the credits, C.K. thanked various people, including comedians Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Bill Burr, and Joe Rogan, and his girlfriend Blanche Gardin. He dedicated the special to his mother who died in 2019.\n\nC.K. donated $30,000 to the staff at the Comedy Cellar in Greenwich Village, New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nC.K. has cited many comedians who have had an influence on him, including George Carlin, Woody Allen, Larry David, Joan Rivers, Robin Williams, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby.\n\nC.K. innovated direct-to-consumer distribution in 2001 when he released his debut comedy album, \"Live in Houston\", directly through his website. He became one of the first performers to use his website to offer direct-to-fan ticket sales for his shows, as well as DRM-free video concert downloads. In this way, C.K. sold tickets for his stand-up tour, circumventing large ticket outlets, bypassing their overhead and the venues they control. C.K. has said the ticket outlets create barriers to consumers, whereas direct distribution is easy—and has effectively \"closed the gap between how easy it was to steal it [versus] how easy it was to buy it\". The success of the special prompted other comedians, including Jim Gaffigan, Joe Rogan, and Aziz Ansari, to release their own specials with a similar business model.\n\nLouis C.K. is known as a writer, director, producer, and actor who has acted in many television series including, \"Lucky Louie\" (2006), \"Louie\" (2010-2015), and \"Horace and Pete\" (2016). He also hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" four times in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017. He has also appeared in television shows such as \"Parks and Recreation\", and \"Portlandia\". C.K. has also starred in a number of critically acclaimed films such as Woody Allen's \"Blue Jasmine\", David O. Russell's \"American Hustle\" (both 2013), and Jay Roach's Hollywood blacklist drama \"Trumbo\" (2015). \n\nFor his work performing stand-up, writing, acting, directing, producing and editing, C.K. has received several awards and nominations. Among them are 39 Emmy Award nominations, with six wins. C.K. has won two Grammy Awards for Best Comedy Album for \"Hilarious\" in 2011, and \"Live at Madison Square Garden\" in 2015. C.K. has also been nominated for two Golden Globes, and five Screen Actors Guild Awards winning one with the ensemble cast of \"American Hustle\" in 2013. C.K. has won three Peabody Awards in the area of Excellence in Entertainment for his shows, \"Louie\", \"Better Things\", and \"Horace and Pete\". For his work on \"Louie\" C.K. earned three Writers Guild of America Awards alongside his writing partner Pamela Adlon.\n\nC.K. married artist Alix Bailey in 1995. Together, they have two daughters: Katherine \"Kitty\" Szekely (b. 2002) and Mary Louise Szekely (b. 2005). The couple divorced in 2008. C.K.'s mother, Mary Louise Szekely, died on June 3, 2019.\n\nC.K. had a brief relationship with musician Fiona Apple.\n\nC.K. confirmed he was dating Blanche Gardin in 2018.\n\nAbout political partisanship, C.K. stated, \"Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I'm very suspicious. It doesn't make sense to me that you'd have the same solution to every issue.\" In March 2016, C.K. sent an email to those subscribed to his mailing list which was critical against the 2016 presidential race. C.K. stated he hoped for a conservative president but likened Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. He labeled Trump an \"insane bigot\" also adding, \"He's not a monster. He's a sad man.\" C.K. later referred to the e-mail as \"irrational\" and claimed he should never write his opinions again.\n\nIn March 2020, C.K. donated to the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign. However, the campaign said that it has refunded the $2,800 donation from C.K. Neither Biden nor C.K. have released statements regarding the matter.\n\nIn 2011, by selling \"Live at the Beacon Theater\" on his website, C.K. earned a \"million dollars in a matter of days, half of which he [gave] away to his staff and charities.\" Recipients included the Fistula Foundation, Green Chimneys, the Pablove Foundation, , and Kiva.\n\nIn 2016, he selected the Fistula Foundation as the beneficiary of his \"Jeopardy!\" Power Players Week appearance, and won $50,000 for the charity.\n\nNotes\nReferences\n"}

(Ph.D.) in Law (1979). He became a member of K.D.St. V. Rappoltstein Köln, a Catholic student fraternity that is member of the Cartellverband.\n\nRüttgers was a Member of the German Bundestag from 1987 until 2000. In 1991 he succeeded Friedrich Bohl as First Secretary of the parliamentary group, in this position assisting the parliamentary group's chairman Wolfgang Schäuble.\n\nRüttgers served as Federal Minister for Education, Science, Research and Technology in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's fifth cabinet from 1994 to 1998. During his time as minister, he was – together with Luigi Berlinguer (Italy), Claude Allegre (France), and Baroness Tessa Blackstone (United Kingdom) – one of the heads of the \"Sorbonne declaration\", the joint declaration on harmonisation of the architecture of the European higher education system, on 25 May 1998. That was the starting point of the so-called \"Bologna process\". He also successfully introduced a law under which online providers can be prosecuted for offering a venue for content illegal in Germany – such as child pornography or Nazi propaganda – if they do so knowingly and it is \"technically possible and reasonable\" to prevent it. Also, the law made Germany the first country to set rules for so-called digital signatures and give them the status of a legal document.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2000, Rüttgers served as deputy chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, again under Schäuble's leadership. In 2000, he succeeded Norbert Blüm as chairman of the CDU in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. As head of the party in Germany's most populous state, he commanded considerable influence, especially with its grassroots. He also became the party's group leader in the state parliament and was elected as one of the CDU's deputy party chairmen in 2000.\n\nAmid the revelations of the CDU donations scandal in early 2000, Rüttgers – who ran as the party's candidate in a crucial state election in North Rhine-Wesphalia that year – was one of the few leading figures who remained loyal to former Chancellor Helmut Kohl even after prosecutors began a criminal investigation into Kohl's financial dealings. By January 2000, daily newspaper \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" claimed that Kohl, angered by party chairman Wolfgang Schäuble's efforts to distance himself from the scandal surrounding secret payments to the party, was encouraging Rüttgers to make a bid for the leadership at the CDU's annual conference; instead, Angela Merkel was elected as Schäuble's successor and Rüttgers became one of her four deputies, alongside Volker Rühe, Annette Schavan and Christian Wulff.\n\nIn his role as chairman of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia, Rüttgers later publicly endorsed Merkel as the party's candidate to challenge incumbent Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in the 2002 federal elections; instead, Edmund Stoiber ended up being the joint candidate of CDU and CSU.\n\nIn the state parliament (\"Landtag\") election 2005, Rüttgers was the opposition Christian Democratic Union's front-runner for the second time. After CDU and FDP won a majority of seats in the election on 22 May 2005, they formed a coalition to take over government from the former SPD and Green party coalition led by Peer Steinbrück.\n\nRüttgers was elected Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia on 22 June. In his cabinet, he notably included representatives of the Christian Democrats’ more liberal wing, such as Armin Laschet (as State Minister for Generations, Family, Women and Integration) and Karl-Josef Laumann (as State Minister of Labor, Health and Social Affairs).\n\nOn the national level, Rüttgers was part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the SPD on a coalition agreement following the 2005 federal elections, which paved the way to the formation of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first government. Under the leadership of Merkel as party chairwoman, he was re-elected vice-chairman of the CDU in November 2006, this time alongside Roland Koch, Annette Schavan and Christian Wulff.\n\nDuring his time in office, Rüttgers came under severe criticism for failing to mend the state's public finances. One of the reasons was the crisis at the state-owned lender WestLB, which led his government to set aside 1.5 billion in 2008. Rüttgers long wanted the bank to stay independent and categorically ruled out a merger with LBBW. However, by 2007, he and Roland Koch, his counterpart from the state of Hesse, agreed on approving a merger of their respective state-owned banks, WestLB and Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen (Helaba). WestLB was eventually broken up in 2012 after years of losses and controversy.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Rüttgers was one of 32 members of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state, which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.\n\nShortly before the 2010 state elections, Rüttgers's public image was damaged by a party fund-raising scandal, and local issues like education and the troubles of municipalities with heavy debt burdens were central to the campaign. He led his party to an electoral defeat; the steep drop of 10 percentage points compared with the previous election, in 2005, was even larger than most analysts had predicted and gave the Christian Democrats their worst postwar showing in that state. The loss also meant Chancellor Angela Merkel could no longer count on a majority for her governing coalition in the Bundesrat, composed of delegations from all 16 states. In July 2010, Rüttgers stepped down as caretaker premier and also gave up his position as state party chairman.\n\nRüttgers joined the Düsseldorf office of German law firm Beiten Burkhardt as Of Counsel in March 2011. In this capacity, he is a member of the firms's Assets, Succession, Foundations practice group and also advises international companies on investments in Germany and German companies on international investments.\n\nIn May 2011, Deutsche Bahn nominated Rüttgers as executive director of the Brussels-based Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies (CER); instead, Libor Lochman was eventually appointed to the position.\n\nRüttgers was a CDU delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2017. \n\nIn addition, Rüttgers has held several paid and unpaid positions since leaving politics, including the following:\n\nDuring his political career, Rüttgers proved to be a conservative on social issues such as immigration. He also positioned himself as a \"workers' leader\" on economics, defending labor rights and opposing business demands for deregulation of the economy. Unlike many in his party at the time, he was also in favor of expanding day care for young children and supported all-day schools. Following the CDU's performance in the 2005 federal elections and the formation of the first government under Chancellor Angela Merkel, Rüttgers blamed her campaign for talking “too much about flat tax and not enough about the people.” Instead, he called on the party to shed its “capitalist” image.\n\nIn his 1993 book \"Dinosaurs of Democracy\", Rüttgers attacked Germany's main parties and the government for being unwilling to decentralise political power to ordinary people.\n\nRüttgers is widely known for his views on immigration and the much-discussed phrase \"\"Kinder statt Inder\"\" (\"children instead of Indians\") which was a media interpretation of \"\"Statt Inder an die Computer müssen unsere Kinder an die Computer\"\" (\"instead of Indians in front of computers, our children must be in front of computers\"), during an election campaign (which he eventually lost) at a time when there was a parallel nationwide discussion about whether or not immigration rules should be liberalised on behalf of attracting more highly qualified foreign academics to the German labor market.\n\nIn response to Rüttgers's much-discussed phrase \"Kinder statt Inder\", Germany's Green Party overwhelmed his Internet mailbox with thousands of messages. The Internet attack was the first of its kind in German politics.\n\n"}

{"id": "1938397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938397", "title": "Queen Elisabeth Competition", "text": "Queen Elisabeth Competition\n\nThe Queen Elisabeth Competition (, ) is an international competition for career-starting musicians held in Brussels. The competition is named after Queen Elisabeth of Belgium (1876–1965). It is a competition for classical violinists (from 1937 to present), pianists (from 1938–), singers (from 1988–) and cellists (from 2017–). It also used to hold international competitions for composers from 1953 to 2012.\n\nSince its foundation it is considered one of the most challenging and prestigious competitions for instrumentalists. In 1957 the Queen Elisabeth Competition was one of the founding members of the World Federation of International Music Competitions.\n\nEugène Ysaÿe, Belgian concert-violinist, wanted to set up an international music competition for young virtuosi showcasing their all-round skill, but died before he could do so. Queen Elisabeth, patroness of the arts and good friend of Ysaÿe, set up the competition in his memory in 1937. The prestige of Ysaÿe and Belgium's Royal Court (King Albert and Queen Elisabeth were admired heroes of the First World War) assured that the first competition would draw great entrants.\n\nThe first two editions of the competition, in 1937 for violin and in 1938 for piano, were named after Ysaÿe. World War II and other impediments prevented the competition from taking place from 1940 to 1950.\n\nIn 1951, the competition was renamed for its patroness, Queen Elisabeth, and has taken place under that name since then. Entrants are expected to learn a compulsory work written especially for the competition. (The work is picked during the composition competition.) Usually there is also a section where contestants are expected to perform a work by a Belgian composer. From 1963 to 1980, Marcel Poot of the Brussels Conservatory chaired the jury of the competition and wrote several commissioned works to mark the occasion, that were used as competition-required pieces.\n\nThe competition restarted with four-year cycles, starting with two consecutive years for violin and piano respectively, followed by a year for international composition competitions. The fourth year of each cycle had no competition. The years 1973 to 1974 were a transition to cycles with instrument competitions in even years, and the internationional composition competition in the year between the violin and the piano competitions, until the early 1980s when the cycles were re-arranged again.\nWith the competition for voice (singing) introduced in 1988 the four-year cycles were piano → voice → violin → year without performer competition. Before 2002 there were no composition competitions in even years.\n\nFrom 2007 there were no longer years without competition for performers: with three disciplines (piano, voice, violin), each of these returned in a three-year cycle.\n\nThere were competitions for composition in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012, each of these for the performance piece of the instrumentalist finale of the next year.\nFrom 2015 there are again four-year cycles, with, for the first time in 2017, a cello competition added after the year with the piano competition. The public composition competitions stopped. The 2020 competition was postponed to 2021.\nThe Queen Elisabeth Competition generates income from its own activities, from private patronage and from sponsoring. Resources are varied: part of the funding for the prizes laureates receive is provided by public authorities and patrons, corporate sponsors, donors contributions, ticket and programme sales, advertising in the programmes and the sale of recordings. The Competition also benefits from the volunteer assistance of families who open their homes to candidates for the duration of the competition.\n\nPrizes for the laureates of the competition (amounts as awarded in the 2015 violin competition):\n\nCompetitions for performing musicians have 12 finalists performing as a soloist before a full symphonic orchestra. Originally all finalists became ranked laureates, later only the first six laureates were ranked. The first editions of the competition were dominated by candidates from the USSR: the 1937 violin competition was won by David Oistrakh and the next year Emil Gilels won the piano competition. The piano competition of 1952 and the violin competition of 1955 were the first to see winners from the United States. By the time of the 50th competition in 2012 an increasing number of Asian contestants reached the finals.\n\nThe first international Queen Elisabeth Competition for composition was held in 1953. Composition competitions had less laureates or finalists, with usually only the winners who see their winning piece performed in the final of the competitions for instrumentalists receiving broad media attention.\nThe competition was covered on the Belgian radio from its first edition, the press writing about contestants and their performances. Broadcasting via television expanded in the 1960s. French-language and Dutch-language Belgian broadcasting organizations started to award prizes based on the preferences of their audiences from 1975 and 1991 respectively. Abdel Rahman El Bacha, Pierre-Alain Volondat, Severin von Eckardstein and Denis Kozhukhin were among the few contestants that were as convincing to the competition jury as to the general audience. Recorded performances were commercialised from 1967. In the 21st century recordings of the competitors' performances were streamed live on the internet and/or made available as video or audio downloads, followed by social media discussions.\n\n\n"}

Since 1999, UMUC accepts 90 FEFU credits of 120 credits total, required for the undergraduate degree, and offers ten online courses for the remaining 30 credits. Another dual degree program with University of Southern Queensland (USQ), Australia, started in 2001. USQ participates in a number of such programs, but FENU was its first Russian university affiliate. . Sixteen of the 24 subjects required for the USQ bachelor's degree in Business can be transferred from FEFU, and FEFU faculty members teach the remaining eight USQ subjects jointly with USQ instructors. The program initiated the first educational videoconferencing in the history of Russian-Australian relations.\n\nInternet videoconference partnership with Waseda University (WU), Tokyo, Japan, started in 2000, and was later extended to a large-scale 2002-2005 project. Each semester, ten Russian tutors teach Russian language to the WU students, and ten Japanese tutors teach Japanese language to the FEFU students for a total of 40 academic hours per week. The quality and scale of the videoconferences are unique in the history of the Russian-Japanese relations. This project is experimental and preceding an even larger educational program. The university offers several programs to foreigners wishing to visit and learn Russian language and literature, with branch programs in Japan and Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is a member of the girl group Atomic Kitten, with whom she has scored three number-one singles and also two number-one albums. In 2006 she went solo and the group reformed in 2012 as part of \"The Big Reunion\", scoring a hit with a cover of Wizzard's \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\". McClarnon co-wrote several Atomic Kitten songs, including the UK Top 10 hits \"See Ya\", \"I Want Your Love\" and \"Someone like Me\".\n\nIn 1997, while McClarnon was still in secondary school, her music teacher arranged for her to take part in an audition with OMD frontman Andy McCluskey, who was aiming to create a new girl group. The group became Atomic Kitten, made up of McClarnon, Kerry Katona and Natasha Hamilton, and they released their first record in 1999. Katona left the group in 2001 and was replaced by Jenny Frost.\n\nAtomic Kitten have had three UK number one singles, \"Whole Again\", \"Eternal Flame\", and \"The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)\". They also had two UK number one albums, \"Right Now\", and \"Feels So Good\", both being certified double-platinum in the UK for sales of over 600,000 copies each. The total worldwide sales are estimated at 6.2 million singles and 4 million albums. Liz is the only member of the group to write any material.\n\nOn 4 March 2012, it was confirmed that the original line-up of Atomic Kitten – McClarnon, Hamilton and Katona – would reform for \"The Big Reunion\", along with five other pop groups of their time – 911, Honeyz, B*Witched, Five and Liberty X.\n\nFollowing Atomic Kitten, McClarnon was signed to All Around the World Records. She released her first solo single, a cover of Barbra Streisand's 1980 hit \"Woman in Love\", on 13 February 2006. The track was produced by Graham Stack along with Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, who also originally co-wrote the song\nand whom McClarnon accompanied on his 2005 tour.\n\nA video was released to promote the song featuring McClarnon in a Manhattan apartment, but it was actually filmed in McClarnon's home town of Liverpool. It was decided to release the single as a double A-side with a cover of Jackie Wilson's \"I Get the Sweetest Feeling\". The single peaked at number 5 in the UK Singles Chart and, after more than six months on release, it peaked at number 16 in the Spanish charts on 22 October 2006.

Founded in 1896, it is the most widely read daily newspaper of any kind in Italy (in 2018). The Sunday edition is called \"La Gazzetta Sportiva\".\n\n\"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" was founded by Eliso Rivera and Eugenio Camillo Costamagna. The first issue was published on 3 April 1896, on time to cover the first modern Olympic Games held in Athens. The paper is based in Milan. Its role extends beyond news reporting and features, to direct involvement in major events, including (since 1909) the organization of the Giro d'Italia (Tour of Italy) cycling stage race.\n\n\"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" is part of the RCS media group. The paper was published in broadsheet format until 2008 when its format was switched to tabloid. The newspaper, published on pink paper, sells over 400,000 copies daily (more on Mondays when readers want to catch up on the weekend's events), and can claim a readership in excess of three million.\nAlthough a wide range of sports are covered in the newspaper, football is given by far most of the coverage. With some 24-28 pages out of 40 devoted to the sport on a daily basis, much of the journalism is speculative and sensationalist rather than the pure reporting of matches. The paper has a good record for campaigning journalism, and played a significant part in exposing the 2006 Serie A scandal that rocked Italian football and led to the relegation of Juventus and points penalties for other leading clubs.\n\nOn 3 April 2016, it celebrated its 120th anniversary by printing the newspaper in green, as it was originally.\n\nIn 1990 the circulation of \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" was 809,000 copies. It was the third best-selling Italian newspaper with a circulation of 401,000 copies in 1997.\n\nThe paper had a circulation of 445,000 copies in 2001, making it the twentieth best-selling European newspaper. In 2008 the paper had a circulation of 368,848 copies. The online version of the paper was the eighteenth most visited website in the country in 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1938450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938450", "title": "Köçek", "text": "Köçek\n\nThe köçek (plural \"köçekler\" in Turkish) was typically a very handsome young male \"rakkas\", or dancer, who usually cross-dressed in feminine attire, and was employed as an entertainer.\n\nThe Turkish word is derived from the Persian word \"kuchak\", meaning \"little\", \"small\", or \"young\", which itself is the Persian pronunciation of the Turkish word \"küçük\", \"little\". In the Crimean Tatar language, the word \"köçek\" means \"baby camel\".\n\nThe culture of the \"köçek\", which flourished from the 17th to the 19th century, had its origin in the customs in Ottoman palaces, and in particular in the harems. Its genres enriched both the music and the dance of the Ottomans.\n\nThe support of the Sultans was a key factor in its development, as the early stages of the art form was confined to palace circles. From there the practice dispersed throughout the Empire by means of independent troupes.\n\nA \"köçek\" would begin training around the age of seven or eight and would be considered accomplished after about six years of study and practice. A dancer's career would last as long as he was beardless and retained his youthful appearance.\n\nThey were recruited from among the ranks of the non-Muslim subject nations of the empire, such as Jews, Romani, Greeks and Albanians. The dances, collectively known as \"köçek oyunu\", blended Arab, Greek, Assyrian and Kurdish elements (Karsilamas dance and Kaşık Havası dance). They were performed to a particular genre of music known as \"köçekçe\", which was performed in the form of suites in a given melody. It too was a mix of Sufi, Balkan and classical Anatolian influences, some of which survives in popular Turkish music today. The accompaniment included various percussion instruments, such as the \"davul-köçek\", the davul being a large drum, one side covered with goat skin and the other in sheep skin, producing different tones. A \"köçek\"s skill would be judged not only on his dancing abilities but also on his proficiency with percussion instruments, especially a type of castagnette known as the \"çarpare\". The dancers were accompanied by an orchestra, featuring four to five each \"kaba kemençe\" and \"laouto\" as principal instruments, used exclusively for \"köçek\" suites. There were also two singers. A \"köçek\" dance in the Ottoman seraglio (palace harem) involved one or two dozen \"köçeks\" and many musicians. The occasions of their performances were wedding or circumcision celebrations, feasts and festivals, as well as the pleasure of the sultans and the aristocracy.\nThe youths, often wearing heavy makeup, would curl their hair and wear it in long tresses under a small black or red velvet hat decorated with coins, jewels and gold. Their usual garb consisted of a tiny red embroidered velvet jacket with a gold-embroidered silk shirt, \"shalvar\" (baggy trousers), a long skirt and a gilt belt, knotted at the back. They were said to be \"sensuous, attractive, effeminate\", and their dancing \"sexually provocative\". Dancers minced and gyrated their hips in slow vertical and horizontal figure eights, rhythmically snapping their fingers and making suggestive gestures. Often acrobatics, tumbling and mock wrestling were part of the act. The \"köçeks\" were available sexually, often to the highest bidder, in the passive role.\n\nFamous poets, such as Fazyl bin Tahir Enderuni, wrote poems, and classical composers, such as the court musician Hammamizade İsmail Dede Efendi (1778–1846), composed \"köçekçes\" for celebrated \"köçeks\". Many Istanbul meyhanes (nighttime taverns serving \"meze\", \"rakı\" or wine) hired \"köçeks\". Before starting their performance, the \"köçek\" danced among the spectators, to make them more excited. In the audience, competition for their attention often caused commotions and altercations. Men would go wild, breaking their glasses, shouting themselves voiceless, or fighting and sometimes killing each other vying for the boys' sexual favors. This resulted in suppression of the practice under Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I.\n\nAs of 1805, there were approximately 600 \"köçek\" dancers working in the taverns of the Turkish capital. They were outlawed in 1837 due to fighting among audience members over the dancers. With the suppression of harem culture under Sultan 'Abdu'l-'Aziz (1861–1876) and Sultan Abdul Hamid II (1876–1908), \"köçek\" dance and music lost the support of its imperial patrons and gradually disappeared.\n\n\"Köçeks\" were much more sought after than the \"çengi\" (\"belly dancers\"), their female counterparts. Some youths were known to have been killed by the \"çengi\", who were extremely jealous of men's attention toward the boys.\n\nA modern interpretation is the movie \"Köçek\" (1975) by director Nejat Saydam. The movie follows the life of Caniko, an androgynous Gypsy, who struggles with his gender identity.\n\n\n\n"}

It existed from 13 November 1939 until 14 February 1942, when it was renamed into Home Army (\"Armia Krajowa, AK\").\n\nZWZ was created from an earlier organization, Service for Poland's Victory (\"SZP\"). In January 1940, it was divided into two parts:\n\nFormally, the ZWZ was directed from Paris, by General Kazimierz Sosnkowski (nom de guerre Jozef Godziemba), who after Poland's defeat escaped to France via Hungary. Due to practical problems, however, Sosnkowski's control of the organization was very limited. The instruction of General Sosnkowski, in which he ordered his subordinates to create regional branches of the ZWZ, was brought to Warsaw on 4 December 1939. According to Sosnkowski, the ZWZ was supposed to be a national military organization, without regard to political differences and social ranks. Furthermore, the idea of a national uprising at the moment of entry of regular Polish units was put forward by Sosnkowski and his staff.\n\nAfter the fall of France, on 18 June 1940, General Wladyslaw Sikorski named Colonel Stefan Rowecki his deputy, with the right to take urgent decisions without consent of the Polish government-in-exile. Sikorski urged Rowecki to closely cooperate with leaders of political parties, gathered in the Political Consultative Committee. The headquarters of the ZWZ formally was under the authority of the Polish government in London, but in reality, military powers were in hands of officers who remained in the occupied country, and had good knowledge of the reality of Nazi- and Soviet-controlled Poland.\n\nAfter the arrest of General Michal Tokarzewski-Karaszewicz, who was captured by the NKVD on the way from Warsaw to Lwow, the ZWZ in Eastern Poland was left without a leader. Following the Operation Barbarossa, the whole territory of the Second Polish Republic found itself under German occupation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1938475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938475", "title": "Ernst May", "text": "Ernst May\n\nErnst May (27 July 1886 – 11 September 1970) was a German architect and .\n\nMay successfully applied urban design techniques to the city of Frankfurt am Main during the Weimar Republic period, and in 1930 less successfully exported those ideas to Soviet Union cities, newly created under Stalinist rule. It is said May's \"brigade\" of German architects and planners established twenty cities in three years, including Magnitogorsk. May's travels left him stateless when the Nazis seized power in Germany, and he spent many years in African exile before returning to Germany near the end of his life.\n\nMay was born in Frankfurt am Main, the son of a leather goods manufacturer. His education from 1908 through 1912 included time in the United Kingdom, studying under Raymond Unwin, and absorbing the lessons and principles of the garden city movement. He finished a study at the Technical University of Munich, working with Friedrich von Thiersch and Theodor Fischer, a co-founder of the Deutscher Werkbund.\n\nWorking for himself and others through the 1910s, in 1921 he helped win a competition for rural housing estate developments in Breslau. His concepts of decentralized planning, some of which had been imported from the garden city movement, he won the job of city architect and planner for his home city from 1925 through 1930. Working under Mayor Ludwig Landmann, the position gave him broad powers of zoning, financing, and hiring. There was copious funding and an available labor pool. He used them.\n\nIn the context of a housing shortage and a degree of political instability, May assembled a powerful staff of progressive architects and initiated the large-scale housing development program New Frankfurt. May's developments were remarkable for the time for being compact, semi-independent, well-equipped with community elements like playgrounds, schools, theatres, and common washing areas. For the sake of economy and construction speed May used simplified, prefabricated forms. These settlements are still marked by their functionality and the way they manifest egalitarian ideals such as equal access to sunlight, air, and common areas. Of these settlements the best known is probably Siedlung Römerstadt, and some of the structures are colloquially known as \"Zickzackhausen\" (zig-zag houses).\n\nIn 1926 May sent for Austrian architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky to join him in Frankfurt. Lihotzky was a kindred spirit and applied the same sort of functional clarity to household problems, and so in Frankfurt, after much analysis of work habits and footsteps, she developed the prototype of the modern installed kitchen, and pursued her idea that \"housing is the organized implementation of living habits\".\n\nMay's Frankfurt was a civic and critical success. This has been described (by John R. Mullin) as \"one of the most remarkable city planning experiments in the twentieth century\". In two years May produced more than 5,000 building units, up to 15,000 units in five years, published his own magazine (\"Zeitschrift Das Neue Frankfurt\") and in 1929 won international attention at the Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne. This also brought him to the attention of the Soviet Union.\n\nCatherine Bauer Wurster visited the buildings in 1930 and was inspired by the work of May\n\nIn 1930 May took virtually his entire New Frankfurt-team to the USSR. \"May's Brigade\" amounted to a task force of 17 people, including Lihotzky, her husband Wilhelm Schuette, Arthur Korn, the Hungarian-born Fred Forbat, the Swiss Hans Schmidt, the Austrian-born Erich Mauthner and the Dutch Mart Stam. The promise of the \"Socialist paradise\" was still fresh, and May's Brigade and other groups of western planners had the hope of constructing entire cities. The first was to be Magnitogorsk. Although May's group is indeed credited with building 20 cities in three years, the reality was that May found Magnitogorsk already under construction and the town site dominated by the mine and blast furnaces under construction. Officials were indecisive, then distrustful, corruption and delay frustrated their efforts, and May himself made misjudgements about the climate. May's contract expired in 1933, and he left for British East Africa (Kenya). Some of his architects found themselves unwanted by Russia, and stateless.\n\nThe 1995 documentary film (\"Socialist Cities\") interviewed some of the last survivors of these groups: Lihotzky, Jan Rutgers, and Phillipp Tolziner of the Bauhaus Brigade, and visited four of the planned cities: Magnitogorsk, Orsk, Novokuznetsk and Kemerovo.\n\nAfter May's departure, the Soviet government began promoting the criticism of his ideas, methods and achievements. Criticism was severe, widespread, and had ideological underpinnings. He was characterized as an undesirable capitalistic and Western influence that should be contraposed to the socialistic and Soviet architectural trends. In the mid-1930s, the Soviet government adopted the policy of not inviting any foreign architects.\n\nMay worked as a farmer in Kenya, but soon sold his farm and opened an architectural office, designing commercial buildings, hotels and schools. In some projects he collaborated with architect and urban planner Erica Mann: for instance his Oceanic Hotel in Mombasa was a landmark within the master plan drawn up for Coast Province by Mann. In 1953 the Mau-Mau uprisings made it difficult to work. At the same time May was invited to return to Germany and work on housing projects. In December 1953 he sailed to Germany and started again as an architect. From 1954 through 1956 he led the planning department in Hamburg, and was involved in several large housing projects in other cities. Several of the most famous German postwar settlements and reconstruction plans, such as New-Altona in Hamburg and Neue-Vahr in Bremen, are associated with his name.\n\nHe was the first person ever awarded an honorary Dr.-Ing. of the Hannover Technical University. From 1957 he taught as an honorary professor of the Technische Universität Darmstadt. During this time May also wrote several books on urbanism. He died in Hamburg in 1970, aged 84.\n\nHis eldest son, Klaus May, also became an architect and worked in the office of his father. His most famous work is the new synagogue in Hamburg, which became a protected landmark. His youngest son, Thomas May, moved from the family home in Kenya in 1947 to obtain an engineering degree at Syracuse University, USA. Thomas May produced many craft works of distinction, including cabinetry, chairs, tables and lighting after debuting his designs in the seminal Museum of Contemporary Crafts show in New York City in 1957.\n\n\n\n"}

She voluntarily resigned from the series because of her imminent divorce from the musician Ray Ellington and her own worries of the inappropriateness for a presenter of a children's programme in this era. West never divulged her reasons for leaving to the producers, who deemed her \"unprofessional\" for simply walking out on the show.\n\nThe length of time West presented \"Blue Peter\" was so short that, for many years, she was not officially recognised as a \"Blue Peter\" presenter, only being added to the official list of presenters upon the show's fortieth anniversary in 1998. In contrast, her replacement, Valerie Singleton, ahead of whom West had come in earlier auditions, became the show's longest-serving female presenter until Konnie Huq.\n\nAfter leaving \"Blue Peter\", West appeared in such shows as \"\", \"Crossroads\" as Doctor Hilary Maddox, \"The Saint\", and \"Lovejoy\".

{"id": "1938508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938508", "title": "Martyrology", "text": "Martyrology\n\nA martyrology is a catalogue or list of martyrs and other saints and beati arranged in the calendar order of their anniversaries or feasts. Local martyrologies record exclusively the custom of a particular Church. Local lists were enriched by names borrowed from neighbouring churches. Consolidation occurred, by the combination of several local martyrologies, with or without borrowings from literary sources.\n\nThis is the now accepted meaning in the Latin Church. In the Orthodox Church, the nearest equivalent to the martyrology is the Synaxarion and the longer Menologion. As regards form, one should distinguish between simple martyrologies that simply enumerate names, and historical martyrologies, which also include stories or biographical details; for the latter, the term \"passionary\" is also used.\n\nThe martyrology, or \"ferial\", of the Roman Church in the middle of the fourth century still exists. It comprises two distinct lists, the \"Depositio martyrum\" and the \"Depositio episcoporum\", lists most frequently found united.\n\nAmong the Roman martyrs, mention is already made in the \"Ferial\" of some African martyrs (March 7, Perpetua and Felicitas; September 14, Cyprian). The calendar of Carthage, which belongs to the sixth century, contains a larger portion of foreign martyrs and even of confessors not belonging to that Church.\n\nThe most influential of the local martyrologies is the martyrology commonly called \"Hieronymian\", because it is (pseudepigraphically) attributed to St. Jerome. It was presumably drawn up in Italy in the second half of the fifth century, and underwent recension in Gaul, probably at Auxerre, in the late sixth. All known manuscripts of the text spring from this Gallican recension.\n\nSetting aside the additions it later received, the chief sources of the \"Hieronymian\" are a general martyrology of the Churches of the East, the local martyrology of the Church of Rome, a general martyrology of Italy, a general martyrology of Africa, and some literary sources, among them Eusebius.\n\nVictor De Buck (\"Acta SS.\", Octobris, XII, 185, and elsewhere) identified the relationship of the \"Hieronymian Martyrology\" to the \"Syriac Martyrology\" discovered by Wright. This is of assistance in recognizing the existence of a general martyrology of the East, written in Greek at Nicomedia, and which served as a source for the \"Hieronymian\".\n\nUnfortunately, this document is in a lamentable condition. Proper names are distorted, repeated or misplaced, and in many places the text is so corrupt that it is impossible to understand it. With the exception of a few traces of borrowings from the \"Passions of the martyrs\", the compilation is in the form of a simple martyrology.\n\nThere were three manuscript versions: that of Bern, Wolfenbuttel. and Echternach. The latter is thought to be the earliest, based on a copy possibly brought to England by Augustine of Canterbury in 597, and written at the Abbey of Echternach, founded by the English missionary Willibrord.\n\nThe \"Martyrologium Hieronymianum Epternacense\", now in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, is thought to have been written in the early eighth century as an Insular version of the \"Hieronymianum\", compiled from two separate copies. In some instances the feast is misplaced by a day. Also known as the Echternach recension, it was adapted to the English Church, incorporating memorials for Augustine of Canterbury, Paulinus of York and others.\n\nIn 1885 De Rossi and Duchesne published a memoir entitled \"Les sources du martyrologe hiéronymien\" (in \"Mélanges d'archéologie et d'histoire\", V), which became the starting-point of a critical edition of the martyrology, published through their efforts in Vol. II for November of the \"Acta SS.\" in 1894.\n\nThe medievalist Dom Henri Quentin and Bollandist Hippolyte Delehaye collaborated on an annotated edition, \"Commentarius Perpetuus in Martyrologium Hieronymianum\", (Brussels, in 1931); Quentin supplied the textual commentary and Delehaye the historical.\n\nThere is another type of martyrology in which the name is followed by a short history of the saint. These are the historical martyrologies. There exists a large number of them, from the ninth century. It may be said that their chief sources are, besides the \"Hieronymian\", accounts derived from the \"Acts of the martyrs\" and some ecclesiastical authors.\n\nOf the best-known historical martyrologies, the oldest go under the names of:\n\nThe most famous of all is that of Usuard (c. 875), \"Martyrology of Usuard\", on which the \"Roman martyrology\" was based.\n\nThe first edition of the \"Roman martyrology\" appeared at Rome in 1583. The third edition, which appeared in 1584, was approved by Gregory XIII, who imposed the \"Roman martyrology\" upon the whole Church. In 1586, Baronius published his annotated edition, which in spite of its omissions and inaccuracies is a mine of valuable information.\n\nThe historical martyrologies taken as a whole have been studied by Dom Quentin (1908). There are also numerous editions of calendars or martyrologies of less universal interest, and commentaries upon them. Mention ought to be made of the famous marble \"calendar of Naples\".\n\nThe critical study of martyrologies is rendered difficult by the multitude and the disparate character of the elements that compose them. Early researches dealt with the historical martyrologies.\n\nThe chief works on the martyrologies are those of Heribert Rosweyde, who in 1613 published at Antwerp the martyrology of Ado; of Sollerius, to whom we owe a learned edition of Usuard; and of Fiorentini, who published in 1688 an annotated edition of the Martyrology of St Jerome. The critical edition of the latter by J. B. de Rossi and Louis Duchesne, was published in 1894.\n\nThe notes of Baronius on the \"Roman Martyrology\" cannot be passed over in silence, the work having done much towards making known the historical sources of the compilations of the Middle Ages. \nIn Vol. II for March of the \"Acta Sanctorum\" (1668) the Bollandists furnished new materials for martyrological criticism by their publication entitled \"Martyrologium venerabilis Bedæ presbyteri ex octo antiquis manuscriptis acceptum cum auctario Flori …\". The results then achieved were in part corrected, in part rendered more specific, by the great work of Père Du Sollier, \"Martyrologium Usuardi monachi\" (Antwerp, 1714), published in parts in Vols. VI and VII for June of the \"Acta Sanctorum.\"\n\nAlthough Du Sollier's text of Usuard is not beyond criticism, the edition surpasses anything of the kind previously attempted. Henri Quentin (\"Les Martyrologes historiques du moyen âge\", Paris, 1908) took up the general question and succeeded in giving a reasonable solution, thanks to careful study of the manuscripts.\n\nAs regards documents, the most important distinction is between local and general martyrologies. The former give a list of the festivals of some particular Church; the latter are the result of a combination of several local martyrologies. We may add certain compilations of a factitious character, to which the name of martyrology is given by analogy, e.g. the \"Martyrologe universel of Chatelain\" (1709). As types of local martyrologies we may quote that of Rome, formed from the \"Depositio martyrum\" and the \"Depositio episcoporum of the chronograph\" of 354; the Gothic \"calendar of Ulfila`s Bible\", the \"calendar of Carthage\" published by Mabillon, the calendar of fasts and vigils of the Church of Tours, going back as far as Bishop Perpetuus (d. 490), and preserved in the \"Historia Francorum\" (xi. 31) of Gregory of Tours. The \"Syriac martyrology\" discovered by Wright (\"Journal of Sacred Literature\", 1866) gives the idea of a general martyrology.\n\nPrior to Vatican II, the Martyrology was read publicly as part of the Roman Catholic Divine Office at Prime. It was always \"anticipated\", that is, the reading for the following day was read. After Vatican II, the office of Prime was suppressed. A fully revised edition was issued in 2001, with rubrics suggesting that the Martyrology might be proclaimed at the end of the celebration of Lauds or of one of the Little Hours, or apart from liturgical celebrations in community gatherings for meetings or meals.\n\nThe model of the \"Roman Martyrology\" is directly derived from the historical martyrologies. It is in sum the \"Martyrology of Usuard\", completed by the \"Dialogues\" of Pope Gregory I and the works of some of the Fathers, and for the Greek saints by the catalogue known as the \"Menologion of Sirlet\".\nThe \"editio princeps\" appeared at Rome in 1583, under the title: \"Martyrologium romanum ad novam kalendarii rationem et ecclesiasticæ historiæ veritatem restitutum, Gregorii XIII pont. max. iussu editum\". It bears no approbation. A second edition also appeared at Rome in the same year. This was soon replaced by the edition of 1584, which was approved and imposed on the entire Roman rite of the Church by Pope Gregory XIII. Baronius revised and corrected this work and republished it in 1586, with the \"Notationes\" and the \"Tractatio de Martyrologio Romano\". The Antwerp edition of 1589 was corrected in some places by Baronius himself. A new edition of the text and the notes took place under Pope Urban VIII and was published in 1630. Pope Benedict XIV was also interested in the \"Roman Martyrology\": his Bull of 1748 addressed to John V, King of Portugal, was often included as a preface in printed copies of the \"Roman Martyrology\".\n\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, a fully revised edition was promulgated in 2001, followed in 2005 by a version (bearing the publication date of 2004) that adjusted a number of typographical errors that appeared in the 2001 edition and added 117 people canonized or beatified between 2001 and 2004, as well as a number of more ancient saints not included in the previous edition. \"The updated Martyrology contains 7,000 saints and blesseds currently venerated by the Church, and whose cult is officially recognized and proposed to the faithful as models worthy of imitation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Friis, is either of two formulas used in telecommunications engineering to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of a multistage amplifier. One relates to noise factor while the other relates to noise temperature.\n\nFriis's formula is used to calculate the total noise factor of a cascade of stages, each with its own noise factor and power gain (assuming that the impedances are matched at each stage). The total noise factor can then be used to calculate the total noise figure. The total noise factor is given as\n\n</math>\n\nwhere formula_1 and formula_2 are the noise factor and available power gain, respectively, of the \"i\"-th stage, and \"n\" is the number of stages. Both magnitudes are expressed as ratios, not in decibels. \n\nAn important consequence of this formula is that the overall noise figure of a radio receiver is primarily established by the noise figure of its first amplifying stage. Subsequent stages have a diminishing effect on signal-to-noise ratio. For this reason, the first stage amplifier in a receiver is often called the low-noise amplifier (LNA). The overall receiver noise \"factor\" is then\n\nwhere formula_4 is the overall noise factor of the subsequent stages.

The eponymous Rotunda in Parnell Square is no longer a part of the hospital complex.\n\nThe hospital was founded by Bartholomew Mosse, a surgeon and man-midwife who was appalled at the conditions that pregnant women had to endure, in George's Lane in March 1745. It was granted by Royal Charter on 2 December 1756 by King George II. Lying-in is an archaic term for childbirth (referring to the month-long bed rest prescribed for postpartum confinement). The venture was very successful and Mosse raised money through concerts, exhibitions and even a lottery to establish larger premises. The hospital moved to new premises, designed by Richard Cassels, where it became known as \"The New Lying-In Hospital\" in December 1757. The Church of Ireland Chapel was opened in 1762. Open to the public, it provided a healthy income to the hospital annually, Dr. Mosse successfully encouraging wealthy protestant Dubliners to attend service there.\n\nRecords indicate that around 1781, \"when the hospital was imperfectly ventilated, every sixth child died within nine days after birth, of convulsive disease; and that after means of thorough ventilation had been adopted, the mortality of infants, within the same, in five succeeding years, was reduced to one in twenty\". This issue was not limited to the Lying-In-Hospital. In that era, ventilation improvement was a general issue in patient care, along with other issues of sanitation and hygiene, and the conditions in which surgeons such as Robert Liston in Britain and elsewhere, had to operate. Florence Nightingale famously worked on the design of safe and healthy hospitals. \n\nThe first caesarean section in Ireland was undertaken at the hospital in 1889.\n\nThe eponymous Rotunda is a rotunda designed by James Ensor, which was completed just in time for a reception hosted by the James FitzGerald, Marquess of Kildare in October 1767. The extensive Rotunda Rooms, designed by Richard Johnston and built adjacent to the rotunda, were completed in 1791. By the early 19th century the hospital had become known as the Rotunda Hospital, after its most prominent architectural feature. The Rotunda became a theatre, where the Irish Volunteers' first public meeting was held in 1913, and later the Ambassador Cinema. The Rotunda Rooms now house the Gate Theatre.\n\nThe Rotunda Hospital, as both a maternity hospital and also as a training centre (affiliated with Trinity College Dublin) is notable for having provided continuous service to mothers and babies since inception, making it the oldest continuously operating maternity hospital in the world. It is estimated that over 300,000 babies have been born there.\n"}

{"id": "1938520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938520", "title": "Paris in the Twentieth Century", "text": "Paris in the Twentieth Century\n\nParis in the Twentieth Century () is a science fiction novel by Jules Verne. The book presents Paris in August 1960, 97 years in Verne's future, where society places value only on business and technology.\n\nWritten in 1863 but first published 131 years later (1994), the novel follows a young man who struggles unsuccessfully to live in a technologically advanced, but culturally backwards world. Often referred to as Verne's \"lost novel\", the work paints a grim, dystopian view of a technological future civilization.\n\nMany of Verne's predictions were remarkably on target. His publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel, would not release the book because he thought it was too unbelievable, and its sales prospects would be inferior to Verne's previous work, \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\".\n\nThe novel's main character is 16-year-old Michel Dufrénoy, who graduates with a major in literature and the classics, but finds they have been forgotten in a futuristic world where only business and technology are valued. Michel, whose father was a musician, is a poet born too late.\n\nMichel had been living with his respectable uncle, Monsieur Stanislas Boutardin, and his family. The day after graduation, Boutardin tells Michel that he is to start working at a banking company. Boutardin doubts Michel can do anything in the business world.\n\nThe rest of that day, Michel searches for literature by classic 19th-century writers, such as Hugo and Balzac. Nothing but books about technology are available in bookstores. Michel's last resort is the Imperial Library. The librarian turns out to be his long-hidden uncle, Monsieur Huguenin. Huguenin, still working in the arts, is considered a \"disgrace\" to the rest of the family, and so was barred from attending Michel's birthdays, graduations, and other family events, though he has followed Michel's life—from a distance. This is the first time they meet in person.\n\nAt his new job, Michel fails at each task with Casmodage and Co. Bank until he is assigned to The Ledger, where Michel dictates the accounts for bookkeeper Monsieur Quinsonnas. Quinsonnas, a kindred spirit of 30, writes the bookkeeping information on The Ledger. Quinsonnas tells Michel that this is a job he can do in order to eat, have an apartment, and support himself while he continues working on a mysterious musical project that will bring him fame and fortune. Michel's fear of not fitting in is resolved; he can be a reader and still work on his own writing after work.\n\nThe pair visit Uncle Huguenin and are joined by other visitors, Michel's former teacher Monsieur Richelot and Richelot's granddaughter, Mademoiselle Lucy. Quinsonnas introduces Michel to his friend, Jacques Aubanet, who dreams of being a soldier, but this is impossible, because warfare has become so scientific that there is really no need for soldiers anymore—only chemists and mechanics are able to work the killing machines. But this profession is denied to even them, because \"the engines of war\" have become so efficient that war is inconceivable and all countries are at a perpetual stalemate.\n\nBefore long, Michel and Lucy are in love. Michel discusses women with Quinsonnas, who sadly explains that there are no such things as women anymore; from mindless, repetitive factory work and careful attention to finance and science, most women have become cynical, ugly, neurotic career women. In fury, Quinsonnas spills ink on The Ledger, and he and Michel are fired on the spot; Quinsonnas leaves for Germany.\n\nIn a society without war, or musical and artistic progress, there is no news, so Michel can't even become a journalist. He ends up living in Quinsonnas' empty apartment while writing superb poetry, but lives in such poverty that he has to eat synthetic foods derived from coal. He eventually writes a book of poetry entitled \"Hopes\" which is rejected by every publisher in Paris.\n\nAs the year 1961 draws to a close, all of Europe enters a winter of unprecedented ferocity. All agriculture is compromised and food supplies are destroyed, resulting in mass famine. The temperature drops to thirty degrees below, and every river in Europe freezes solid. In despair, Michel spends his last bit of money on violets for Lucy, but finds that she has disappeared from her apartment, evicted when her grandfather lost his job as the university's last teacher of rhetoric. He is unable to locate her amongst the thousands of starving people in Paris. He spends the entire evening stumbling around Paris in a delirious state. Michel becomes convinced that he is being hunted by the Demon of Electricity, but no matter where he goes, he is unable to escape its presence.\n\nIn the climax of the story, the heartbroken Michel, bereft of friends and loved ones, wanders through the frozen, mechanized, electrical wonders of Paris. The subjective narrative becomes steadily more surreal as the suffering artist, in a final paroxysm of despair, unconsciously circles an old cemetery and finally collapses comatose in the snow.\n\nThe book's description of the technology of 1960 was in some ways remarkably close to actual 1960s technology. The book described in detail advances such as cars powered by internal combustion engines (\"gas-cabs\") together with the necessary supporting infrastructure such as gas stations and paved asphalt roads, elevated and underground passenger train systems and high-speed trains powered by magnetism and compressed air, skyscrapers, electric lights that illuminate entire cities at night, fax machines (\"picture-telegraphs\"), elevators, primitive computers which can send messages to each other as part of a network somewhat resembling the Internet (described as sophisticated electrically powered mechanical calculators which can send information to each other across vast distances), the utilization of wind power, automated security systems, the electric chair, and remotely-controlled weapons systems, as well as weapons destructive enough to make war unthinkable.\n\nThe book also predicts the growth of suburbs and mass-produced higher education (the opening scene has Dufrénoy attending a mass graduation of 250,000 students), department stores, and massive hotels. A version of feminism has also arisen in society, with women moving into the workplace and a rise in illegitimate births. It also makes accurate predictions of 20th-century music, predicting the rise of electronic music, and describes a musical instrument similar to a synthesizer, and the replacement of classical music performances with a recorded music industry. It predicts that the entertainment industry would be dominated by lewd stage plays, often involving nudity and sexually explicit scenes.\n\nJules Verne's publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel, thought the book's pessimism would damage Verne's then-booming career, and suggested that he wait 20 years to publish it. In a scathing rebuke to Verne, Hetzel writes about a draft of the novel he has just seen:\n\nHetzel was also critical of Verne for not covering new ground with the novel:\n\nWith that, Verne put the manuscript in a safe where it was forgotten, only to be discovered by his great-grandson in 1989. The original French version was finally published in 1994, and an English translation by Richard Howard was published by Random House in 1996.\n\nThe appearance of Verne's lost novel caused a stir among modern critics, who mostly received the book warmly, greeting it as \"prescient and plausible\". On the other hand, some saw the book every bit as unnecessarily pessimistic about the future as did Verne's editor.\n\nThe book was a best seller in France, where it was heavily promoted before publication. Some critics were put off by the publisher's hype of the book, although most readily admitted it was \"a work of inestimable historical importance\".\n\nCritic Evelyn C. Leeper suggested that Verne might be a good candidate for a Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1996, noting that she had not read very many novels that were much better than Verne's work that year. The Hugo Award is given annually to honor the best science fiction of the preceding year.\n\nThe work is also of importance to scholars of Verne's literary achievements, some of whom had long asserted that none of his works ever came close to prophesying the future of a whole civilization.\n\nWithin two years of the novel's appearance, it had been adapted as a stage play in the Netherlands.\n\n"}

{"id": "1938564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938564", "title": "Plantation (settlement or colony)", "text": "Plantation (settlement or colony)\n\nPlantation was an early method of colonisation where settlers went in order to establish a permanent or semi-permanent colonial base, for example for planting tobacco or cotton. Such plantations were also frequently intended to promote Western culture and Christianity among nearby indigenous peoples, as can be seen in the early East-Coast plantations in America (such as that at Roanoke). Although the term \"planter\" to refer to a settler first appears as early as the 16th-century, the earliest true colonial plantation is usually agreed to be that of the Plantations of Ireland.\n\nThe word \"plantation\" was applied to the large farms that were the economical basis of many of the 17th-century American colonies. The peak of the plantation economy in the Caribbean was in the 18th century, especially for the sugar plantations that depended on slave labour. Most of that time Britain prospered as the top slaving nation in the Atlantic world. More than 2,500,000 slaves were transported to the Caribbean plantations between 1690 and 1807. Because slave life was so harsh on these plantations and slaves died without reproducing themselves, a constant supply of new slaves from Africa was required to maintain the plantation economy against this \"natural decrease\". In 1789 the French colony of Saint-Domingue, producer of 40 percent of the world's sugar, was the most valuable colony on earth. Slaves outnumbered whites and free people of colour by at least eight to one, but provided nearly all of the manual labour, and essentially all of it on the plantations. Slave labour made sugar production profitable. Importing sugar to Great Britain resulted in a dramatic change in the eating habits of Britons, one of the greatest in human history. In 1700, Britons used an average of four pounds of sugar a year, but by 1800 they used an average of 16 pounds a year.\n\nThe Plantations of Ireland were an instrument of retribution and colonisation after several Irish rebellions against English rule throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The largest settlement, the Plantation of Ulster in the northern part of the island, was established following the rebellion of Hugh Roe O'Donnell and Hugh O'Neill in the Nine Years' War (1594-1603). The plantations were seen as part of process that would Anglicise Ireland, as well as a means of maintaining English political control in Ireland. Lands were seized from the native landowners both as punishment for rebellion and as punishment for remaining Catholic rather than conforming to the (Protestant) established church. These lands were given to English (and later, Scottish) Protestant settlers who would be loyal to the Crown and keep the native Irish under control.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Scottish government planted Scots-speaking lowland merchant colonies in the Gàidhealtachd (the Gaelic-speaking part of Scotland), for example at Campbeltown and Cromarty.\n\nJamestown, Virginia was the first permanent English settlement in North America. During the 17th century, the Chesapeake Bay area was immensely hospitable to tobacco cultivation. Ships annually hauled 1.5 million pounds (680,000 kilograms) of tobacco out to the Bay by the 1630s, and about 40 million pounds (18 million kilograms) by the end of the century. Farmers responded to falling prices by growing even more tobacco. The labour supply from Africa (slaves) was expensive. In the 17th century, farmers relied on indentured servants for labour. To encourage settlement of the colonies, the Crown granted land to colonists who paid for workers and other settlers under a headrights system. The planters replaced tobacco with other crops after the soils became exhausted in the coastal areas. Cotton was produced on plantations on the Sea Islands off South Carolina and Georgia. \n\nThe economy of the South changed markedly beginning in the early nineteenth century, as the invention of the cotton gin made cultivation of short-staple cotton profitable across vast areas of the upland Southeast. Settlers poured into what became known as the Deep South, putting pressure on the federal government to remove the Native American tribes from the Southeast. In the 1830s, the government forced most of the Five Civilised Tribes to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, leading to rapid development of extensive cotton plantations across the South to eastern Texas. Cotton was king, and worldwide demand for American cotton resulted in growing wealth among planters in the South, wholly dependent on enslaved labour.\n\nEuropean colonists did not regard the land as belonging to the tens of thousands of Native Americans who occupied it, because their patterns of use were so different. The Plantations of New England were considered to occupy \"virgin\" land or wilderness. The Plymouth Plantation, was settled to create a new beginning for English dissenters and, as such, was essentially utopian. Later plantations were more overtly entrepreneurial: European investors funded colonists in the expectation of good returns. Examples of the latter include the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the New Haven Colony, the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam (now New York), and the French in Canada, where they named their colony as New France .\n\nIn the state of Maine, the old meaning has been preserved in the name of a type of local government jurisdiction. It is also preserved in the full name of Rhode Island: Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\n\n"}

It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of \"Systema Naturae\".\nThis species has brown forewings, varying considerably in tone, with indistinct darker markings. The hindwings are buffish with a black spot at the tornus. At rest, the species has a very distinctive profile with tufts of hairs protruding upwards from the thorax and the hind edge of the forewings (this latter feature shared with other prominents). The margins of the forewings are also wavy. This rather \"lumpy\" appearance has led to the rather fanciful comparison to the comb on a cock's head. Two broods are produced each year with adults on the wing in May and June and again in August and September. This moth flies at night and is attracted to light.\n\nThe larva is green or brown with a yellow stripe down each side and two red humps at the rear end.

The grenade was one of a number of anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an \"ad hoc\" solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. \n\nDesigned by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.\n\nThe grenade had several faults with its design. In tests, it failed to adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and, if the user was not careful after freeing the grenade from its casing, it could easily stick to their uniform. The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve the grenade for use by the British Army, but personal intervention by the prime minister, Winston Churchill, led to the grenade going into production. \n\nBetween 1940 and 1943, approximately 2.5 million were produced. It was primarily issued to the Home Guard, but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa, accounting for six German tanks; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead, including the First Special Service Force; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign. The French Resistance were also issued a quantity of the grenades.\n\nSince at least 1938, Jefferis had been toying with the idea of a demolition or anti-tank weapon that would be ideal for irregular warfare. It was to work by having an explosive charge deform so that it had a substantial area of intimate contact with the surface of the target. Then, when detonated, the effect of the explosion would be focused on a small area and would rupture an armoured plate much thicker than would otherwise be the case. Sappers call such a device a \"poultice\" or \"squash head\" charge. Jefferis enlisted Bauer and Schulman of the Colloid Science Department of Cambridge University, they experimented with lengths of bicycle inner tube filled with plasticine to represent the explosive. These were fitted with wooden handles and dipped in rubber solution to make them sticky. In experiments, these prototypes proved difficult to aim and only by chance did any stick to the metal bins used to represent tanks.\n\nWith the end of the Battle of France and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940, a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely. However, the British Army was not well equipped to defend the country in such an event; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty-seven divisions. The army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had been left behind in France and only 167 were available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes.\n\nUnder the circumstances, Jefferis considered that his idea might have more general application for the British Army and the Home Guard. Jefferis was in charge of a department known as , which had been created to develop and deliver weapons for use by guerrilla and resistance groups in occupied Europe. was now charged with the development of the sticky bomb.\n\nThe problem of designing a sticky bomb was delegated to Robert Stuart Macrae.\n\nSome sort of flexible bag was required to contain an explosive gel so that it did not matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag was found to be hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container. He obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool, rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass broke and the bomb deformed to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. \n\nThe grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay started as the grenade left the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).\n\nMeanwhile, finding a suitable adhesive was a significant problem. After unsuccessful experiments with a variety of candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. \n\nMacrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter \"K\" and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's chief chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.\n\nThe filling for the bomb was developed by ICI. It was nitroglycerin-based with a variety of additives to make it more stable and viscous. The glass flask containing the main charge held about of this explosive that was described as having the consistency of Vaseline.\n\nThe adhesive surface was protected by a light metal case which was released by pulling a safety pin: the case fell away as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge. The inside of the case was fitted with a number of rubber spikes that kept it clear of the glued surface of the grenade. Early models also had a strip of adhesive tape round the neck of the casing.\n\nDevelopment continued, but there were problems with service regulations that were not written with such an unconventional weapon in mind. The sticky bomb was inevitably rather fragile and even a specially designed box could not fully meet the army's demanding requirements for withstanding rough handling without damage. It seemed there were problems at every turn. The prime minister, Winston Churchill, who was concerned with the state of the country's anti-tank defences, learnt about the grenade and urged its development. \n\nThe Ordnance Board of the War Office did not approve the grenade to be used by the army. However, Churchill ordered further tests to be conducted in July, and after personally viewing a demonstration of the grenade ordered that it immediately be put into production. His memo of October 1940 simply read \"Sticky bomb. Make one million\". A couple of days later, Anthony Eden, then secretary of state for war, added a scribbled note to a cabinet minute that recorded the order to go ahead with the bomb:\n\nIn spite of top level pressure, the arguments rumbled on. Trials were disappointing, it was not possible to get the bomb to adhere to any surface that was wet or covered with even the thinnest film of dried mud \"a customary condition of tanks\" as Major-General Ismay, on 27 June, pointed out.\n\nChurchill was not amused:\n\nMacrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit to record these arguments over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, there was a lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a \"coup de grâce\" by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.\n\nIn his memoirs, Ismay recalled that he never solved the puzzle of how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people. A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto the top of a tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.\n\nChurchill considered any obstruction, however well-meaning, as singularly lacking in imagination. In the event of invasion, he foresaw a desperate fight to the last and after the war, he wrote about how he envisaged the use of the sticky bomb: \"We had the picture in mind that devoted soldiers \"or civilians\" would run close up to the tank and even thrust the bomb upon it, though its explosion cost them their lives. There were undoubtedly many who would have done it [Italics added for emphasis].\" He also later recorded how he intended to use the slogan: \"You can always take one with you.\"\n\nArguments rumbled on and there were endless delays. Early versions of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced and the rate of production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No. 74 grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.\n\nOn 14 May 1941, Lieutenant-General Sir Ian Jacob reflected:\n\nBetween 1940 and 1943 approximately 2.5 million were produced.\n\nThe grenade, hand, anti-tank No. 74 consisted of a glass sphere in which was contained approximately of semi-liquid nitroglycerin devised by ICI. The sphere was covered in stockinette which was coated with a liberal amount of birdlime, an extremely adhesive substance from which the nickname 'sticky bomb' was derived. A casing made out of thin sheet-metal, and formed of two halves, was then placed around the sphere and held in place by a wooden handle, inside which was a five-second fuse. The handle also contained two pins and a lever; the first pin was pulled out to make the casing fall away, and the second to activate the firing mechanism in the grenade. \n\nThis primed the grenade, with the lever being held down to ensure the fuse was not triggered; then the user would run up to the tank and stick the grenade to its hull, using as much force as possible to break the sphere and spread the nitroglycerin onto the hull in a thick paste. Another alternative was for the user to throw it at the tank from a distance. Either way, the lever would be released and the fuse activated, and the grenade would then detonate.\n\nThe grenade did possess several problems with its design. Users were urged to actually run up to the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then be placed in the unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. \n\nAs the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade to the rear of the tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.\n\nAccording to a War Office training pamphlet dated 29 August 1940, the sticky bomb should be regarded as a portable demolition device which can be \"quickly and easily applied\". It was reckoned to be effective against armour of up to thickness and was suitable for use against \"baby\" tanks, armoured cars and the vulnerable points on medium and heavy tanks. The safest and easiest application was simply to drop it from an upstairs window; otherwise, it could be used in an ambush of mobile tanks moving along a narrow road or in an attack on tanks parked up for the night. \n\nThe sticky bomb could be either thrown or slapped in place by hand, in the latter case, the advice was to use sufficient force to break the glass thereby creating a greater area of contact resulting in a more effective explosion. Finally, there was also the option of placing the bomb first and then pulling out the pin at a safe distance by means of a length of string.\n\nMacrae credits the Australian army with developing the technique of slapping a sticky bomb directly onto a tank instead of throwing it from a relatively safe distance. Since the bomb used a blast effect, it was safe to do this and walk away provided only that the bomb's handle was pointing away from the bomber – the handle would be shot away from the explosion \"like a bullet.\" Macrae gives no date for the development of this tactic. Macrae confirmed that placing the bomb rather than throwing it gives better adhesion and allows thicker plates to be penetrated.\n\nThe potential of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel \"Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly\". The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series \"Dad's Army\". In the episode \"Fallen Idol\", Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.\n\nBy July 1941, 215,000 sticky bombs had been produced. Of these, nearly 90,000 had been sent abroad to North and South Africa, the Middle East and to Greece where they did useful service. The remainder were stored at Ordnance Depots or distributed to army and Home Guard units.\n\nThe grenade was first issued in 1940 to Home Guard units, who appeared to have taken a liking to it despite its flaws. Although the Ordnance Board had not approved the grenade to be used by regular army units, a quantity were provided for training purposes. However, a number of sticky bombs did find their way to British and Commonwealth units participating in the campaign in North Africa, and were used as anti-tank weapons. During the Afrika Korps advance towards the town of Thala in February 1943, they accounted for six German tanks. \n\nThey were also issued to units of the Australian Army, who used them during the Battle of Wau and the Battle of Milne Bay. They were used by various allied units on the Anzio Beachhead, namely the First Special Service Force, who obtained them from the British. A large number were also supplied to the French Resistance.\n\nIn 1947, the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors considered claims from Macrae and from the managing director of Kay Brothers. Macrae's legal representative was Edward Terrell – himself a wartime inventor. At the time the crown opposed granting an award; when Macrae was asked what elements of the sticky bomb he claimed to have invented, he replied \"I am claiming no invention; I merely claim the development of the bomb, which was my job.\" However, in 1951, the commission recommended that Macrae should receive an \"ex-gratia\" payment of £500 () and Norwood received £250 () for his contribution.\n\nUsers of the grenade included:\n\n\n\n"}

In 1990 he performed in the Off-Off-Broadway production \"Amazonia\".\n\nAlarcón was born in Pellegrini, Buenos Aires province . He lived a normal childhood, showing signs of wanting to become an actor since then.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Alarcón participated in a number of Argentine telenovelas and films. His participation in these gave Alarcón much popularity across his home country, as he became a favorite of the female audience there. During that decade, he married fellow actress Monica Jouvet. Jouvet died in a car accident in 1981.\n\nHe reached international celebrity when WAPA-TV of Puerto Rico signed him in 1983 to make telenovelas for them. Alarcón starred alongside Camille Carrion in the international hit \"Vivir Para Ti\", which is generally considered by Puerto Rican television critics to be one of the best soap operas ever made in the country. WAPA-TV sold the soap opera to stations in Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and other important Latin American markets where Alarcón was not well known before. In addition, since WAPA-TV's transmissions reached the United States Virgin Islands as well, viewers in those islands were able to know Alarcón as well.\n\nWhile in Puerto Rico, Alarcón met actress Claribel Medina, and the two soon fell in love with each other, beginning a relationship that was both seen with respect and disdain by Puerto Rican television viewers, some of which had problems accepting the fact that Alarcón was 36 at the time while Medina had come out of her teenage period just a few years before. The couple began making the covers of Estrellita, Teve Guía, Vea, Artistas and other Puerto Rican entertainment publications. The couple got married in 1985.\n\nAlarcón and Medina continued working on various Puerto Rican television projects, which required for Alarcón to become a full-time resident of Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, Alarcón became known around his wife's country for his constant praising of his new home country on the local media. But the Puerto Rican telenovela industry disappeared after 1989, and the Alarcón-Medina couple, apparently forced by work shortage, decided to move to Argentina.\n\nBack in Argentina, Alarcón semi-retired, acting in a small number of soap operas during the first half of the 1990s. Medina became a celebrity there as well, and the couple had two daughters.

{"id": "1938662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938662", "title": "Drama (Yes album)", "text": "Drama (Yes album)\n\nDrama is the tenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Yes, released on 18 August 1980 by Atlantic Records. It was their first album to feature Trevor Horn as lead vocalist, as well as keyboardist Geoff Downes. This followed the departures of Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman after numerous attempts to record a new album in Paris and London had failed. \"Drama\" was recorded hurriedly, because a tour had already been booked before the change in personnel. The album marked a departure in the band's musical direction with more accessible and aggressive songs, and featuring the use of modern keyboards, overdriven guitar, and a vocoder.\n\n\"Drama\" was released to a mostly positive critical reception, with most welcoming the band's new sound. It peaked at No. 2 in the UK and No. 18 in the US, though it became their first album since 1971 not to reach gold certification by the RIAA. \"Into the Lens\" was released as the album's sole single. Yes toured the album with a 1980 tour of North America and the UK, and were met with some negative reactions during the UK leg over the new line-up change. At its conclusion, Yes disbanded. The album was remastered in 2004 with previously unreleased bonus tracks, and it was performed live in its entirety for the first time in 2016.\n\nAt the end of their 1978–79 tour to support their ninth studio album \"Tormato\" (1978), the group, Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman, and Alan White, took a break from touring and recording. They reconvened in November 1979 to start work for a new album. After the various problems they faced while recording \"Tormato\", Yes decided to work in Paris with Roy Thomas Baker to oversee its production and musical direction. Anderson and Wakeman were enthusiastic in putting together new material, writing more songs together than they had before. However, Squire, Howe and White felt their songs were too light and folk-oriented and proceeded to develop more aggressive and direct compositions. The growing internal differences, described by Anderson as a \"loss of respect for each other\", led to Squire, Howe, White and Baker to not come to sessions on time, which discouraged Anderson and Wakeman, the latter at times refusing to leave his hotel room to rehearse. Both members took to leave the studio and drink Calvados in a bar; in Wakeman's words: \"It can make you quite depressed. Jon and I got really quite depressed and started crying on each other's shoulders and Jon said 'This is not the band that I love, this is not the band that I wanted to keep on going', [and I replied] 'I'm with you, Jon'\". The sessions were ultimately called off after White cracked a bone in his right ankle while roller skating early in the morning with Richard Branson in a nightclub, rendering him unable to perform for about six weeks. Following a break over Christmas, the band reconvened in London for rehearsals in an attempt to salvage the situation. They failed, causing Anderson and Wakeman to depart in March 1980.\n\nSquire, Howe, and White continued to write and rehearse as a three-piece in Townhouse Studios. At the same time, bassist and singer Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes of the new wave band The Buggles were enjoying worldwide success with their 1979 hit single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", and had recently secured Brian Lane as their new manager. Since Lane was also responsible for Yes, and with both groups now working from the same office, Lane asked Horn and Downes, both fans of Yes, to contribute a song for the trio. Downes and Horn were invited to Squire's Virginia Water mansion, New Pipers, where Horn presented the song by singing while playing guitar to him. Squire remarked that his voice was similar to Anderson's and invited both musicians to Yes rehearsals, which Downes characterised as \"a bit directionless, because they were rehearsing as a three piece [...] you can only go so far as a rhythm section\". The duo presented an eight-minute Buggles song that was deemed too long to record themselves named \"We Can Fly from Here\", which the three Yes members liked and wanted to develop. Meanwhile, the Buggles weren't informed of Anderson's departure, and were confused by his absence; Squire didn't answer them and they only found out about the situation by the point that they were being pushed to record the song. Horn had some doubts in becoming Yes's new singer as he realised the difficulties of replacing Anderson considering the reputation he had built with the fans, but went for it as he knew such an opportunity would not arise again. Feeling Horn and Downes were suitable replacements, Squire convinced Howe and White to let them join. Lane announced the idea to Ahmet Ertegun, then president of Atlantic Records, the band's label, who flew to London to assess the situation and see if the new formation was commercially viable. Ertegun approved, thus giving the green-light for a new album.\n\n\"Drama\" was recorded in approximately three months at Townhouse Studios with each band member credited for its production and Hugh Padgham, Gary Langan, and Julian Mendelsohn as recording engineers. The sessions began with Eddy Offord, Yes' former engineer and producer from 1970 to 1974, but several issues resulted in his departure as the album was being made; Downes said Offord \"left in strange circumstances. It was a fraught and manic time\", but he remained credited as producer of the backing tracks. The music was put together in several locations; Howe recorded some of his guitars at RAK Studios and Chalk Farm and other parts of the album were recorded at SARM East Studios. Howe recorded all his parts in 2 weeks, saying \"I had total freedom. I went away and recorded 90 percent of the guitars on my own in a London studio and went back and presented it to the band. At first, people said 'Your guitars sound too bright and treble-y.' I said 'No, shut up and use them'\". Horn spoke about his efforts to get the album finished: \"I got married and two hours later, I was back in the studio. [We decided that] for our honeymoon, we were going to spend two weeks in Miami Beach ... it ended up as three days in Bournemouth and Steve came along, we had a good time actually\". Horn and Howe went on to do the album's mixdown by themselves.\n\nThe album opens with the ten-minute \"Machine Messiah\" which, according to Horn, was written in one day. It features some guitar riffs from Howe that reporter and critic Chris Welch described as \"unexpectedly heavy metal\". White called the song his \"baby\", putting together much of its structure and rhythm. Squire found some of its passages difficult to play on his bass and thought it was more suited for keyboards, but was encouraged by White to master his parts. Downes rates the track highly, citing its various sections and mood changes. When he was composing his keyboard parts for the song, Downes included an arpeggiated segment from the Toccata fifth movement of Symphony for Organ No. 5 by Charles-Marie Widor, a piece that he was familiar with from his youth.\n\n\"White Car\" was recorded in one afternoon. Downes only played a Fairlight CMI synthesiser on the recording, to test its sampling capabilities: \"I tried to simulate an orchestra using these samples, but it was very early days of digital sampling. The bandwidth was very narrow, but that's what gave it all that characteristic 'crunch factor'. We then added the vocoder and Trevor's vocal to the mix\". Horn's lyrics were about seeing pop figure Gary Numan driving his Stingray, which was given to him by his record company.\n\n\"Does It Really Happen?\" originated from the 1979 Paris sessions, with White coming up with its drum pattern. A version featuring Anderson singing a different set of lyrics was recorded, but it was shelved until it was developed further when Horn and Downes joined and made additions to the song. Horn and Squire wrote new lyrics.\n\n\"Into the Lens\" was originally completed by Horn and Downes before they joined the group, but Squire took a liking to it and wished to re-arrange it as a Yes track. The track features Downes using a vocoder, further highlighting the band's new sound. A version recorded by Horn and Downes only was later released on the second Buggles album, \"Adventures in Modern Recording\" (1981), with the title \"I Am a Camera\".\n\n\"Run Through the Light\" features Howe playing a Les Paul guitar, \"in the background being very melancholy\" with Squire playing a piano and Horn playing bass, something which Horn did not particularly wish to do, but Squire convinced him to perform. \"I didn't quite know what to play on it ... one day we spent twelve hours playing and working the final bass part\". A different version of the song was recorded with Anderson.\n\n\"Tempus Fugit\" was another song sketched out by the Squire, Howe and White trio in late 1979. Its title is a Latin expression that translates as \"time flies\". According to Howe, its name was derived from Squire's habit of arriving late to places.\n\nYes worked on further material during the recording sessions, but remained incomplete. This included \"We Can Fly from Here\" and \"Go Through This\", which were performed on the 1980 tour and later released on the live compilation album \"The Word is Live\" (2005). \"We Can Fly from Here\" was expanded into a 20-minute suite on Yes's studio album \"Fly from Here\" (2011). A third track, \"Crossfire\", was later included on \"\".\n\nThe album's sleeve was designed by Roger Dean, his first design for a Yes album since \"Relayer\" in 1974. When Dean was commissioned to work on the project, he knew of the album's title before working on it and adopted \"an intuitive approach\" to complete it. His previous work was known for its fantasy and mysticism, but this time he made a conscious effort not to do so with things \"that you couldn't see in the world today. Maybe they're being shuffled around a bit, but it's not in any degree fantastic\". He expressed a particular interest in illustrating a storm adorned sky, with \"the light playing across the landscape, so there were some bits that jumped out and very stark and bright, and other bits that are very dark – black on dark grey\". Dean summarised that \"there was a lot going on\" on the final cover, incorporating various elements and \"stirred it up ... they came out in a way I guess that training and good luck worked together\". In 2013, Dean spoke fondly of his design, ranking it as one of his favourite paintings.\n\n\"Drama\" was released on 18 August 1980. It reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 18 in the US, the band's lowest charting studio release since \"The Yes Album\" (1971), which peaked at No. 40. \"Into the Lens\" was released as the album's sole single in 1980. The band shot music videos for \"Into the Lens\" and \"Tempus Fugit\", both of them mimed live performances with minimal visual effects.\n\nThe album has been reissued several times; the first was in 1994 by Atlantic Records. In 2004, Rhino Records issued a remastered edition with several previously unreleased tracks, including some from the band's sessions from Paris in late 1979.\n\n\"The Guardian\" reporter Robert Denselow wrote that the album's lyrics are tougher than Anderson's \"distinctive ramblings on the mystic fringe\", and named \"Machine Messiah\" and \"Into the Lens\" as tracks that made \"Drama\" a distinctive album. Bill Carlton wrote in \"The New York Times\" that with \"Drama\", Yes \"didn't take any chances alienating the faithful\" fans with a new wave or punk direction and \"sound more like Yes than Yes\". Carlton wrote the album is \"full of their tried-and-true brew of orchestral, dramatic, art-rock extrapolations\" and is just as \"daring and fanciful\" as their previous albums. Carlton picked \"Tempus Fugit\" as his favourite. In \"The Los Angeles Times\", John Mendelssohn wrote that \"Drama\" is \"infinitely more accessible\" than earlier Yes albums, \"still highly demanding listening\". In the same publication reviewer Steve Pond compared Dean's \"kitschy, dramatic land-and-seascape\" artwork on the album's sleeve to the music on it.\n\nPond considered \"Drama\" the most traditional Yes album in several years, proving to \"anxious fans\" about the line-up change that the new group can sound \"just like the old model\". He described Horn's vocals as at times \"uncanny\" to Anderson's. A review in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" gave \"Drama\" three stars out of four. With the new line-up, \"the results are quite pleasing\" with the band displaying greater vitality and strength than their more recent albums, with \"generally superb\" material. The review picked \"Machine Messiah\", \"Does It Really Happen?\" and \"Tempus Fugit\" as highlight tracks. George Kanzler in \"Tallahassee Democrat\" wrote that Yes still retained their \"patented group sound\" despite Anderson and Wakeman's departure, with high tenor vocals, \"rhapsodic\" solos, and \"brisk\" tempo changes. He picked out Howe's guitar work as the band's \"invaluable asset\" but said the lyrics \"are pretentious as always\" which focuses mostly on a mixture of light and dark imagery. \"Rolling Stone\" picked out \"Machine Messiah\", \"Tempus Fugit\", and \"Into the Lens\" as stand out tracks. It noted the addition of Horn and Downes in the band \"has not substantially altered the Yes sound, image or presentation. The high vocals, symphonic arrangements, and quasi-mystical lyrics are still there\". It pointed out the \"fresh new spirit\" of the group's playing, though commented that the Buggles' hit single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" is more memorable than the album itself.\n\nJoe Konz, in \"The Indianapolis Star\", wrote Downes is an \"adequate\" replacement for Wakeman but pointed out that Horn's voice does not work as well in certain sections, such as \"Into the Lens\". He picked out that track with \"Machine Messiah\" and \"Tempus Fugit\" as highlights, the latter containing what Yes \"does best\" with harmony singing, playing their instruments \"rampantly\", and making \"vigorous rock and roll\". On \"Machine Messiah\", the band \"assembles every kind of artillery that it can unload\" with its heavy metal opening and duel between guitar and vocoder which Konz compared to \"Dueling Banjos\" from the film \"Deliverance\". He concluded with \"Drama\" being Yes's best in years. In a review written in the \"Fort Lauderdale News\", Cameron Cohick thought \"Drama\" \"sounds exactly like Yes has always sounded. Frighteningly so\". The opening to \"Machine Messiah\" is compared to Black Sabbath fashion with its \"ponderous, droning riff\" and keyboard lines from Downes that he compared to Wakeman. He compared the overall mood of \"Drama\" to \"Fragile\" and \"Close to the Edge\" (1972) with \"relatively simple\" song structures, most with at least one good riff. Though he considered the lyrics are \"the usual quasi-cosmic tripe\", Cohick picked \"Run Through the Light\" as the album's best track which he compared to \"The Battle of Evermore\" by Led Zeppelin.\n\nMusic critic Rick Johnson thought the group came up with a consistent album, summarising it as \"fairly solid stuff\". In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Paul Collins rates the album three stars out of five, writing: \"It rocks harder than other Yes albums\" and a \"harbinger of Yes and Asia albums to come\" throughout the 1980s. He points out Squire's \"emboldened\" and \"aggressive\" bass playing with White's drums, and Howe's \"more metallic\" approach. Collins picks out \"Machine Messiah\" and \"Tempus Fugit\" as the album's best tracks within an album of promising material.\n\nFormer (and later) Yes singer Jon Anderson felt the album was \"not my idea of Yes\" and did not represent what the band \"truly is\", but was open to rehearsing songs from the record during his later tenures in the group, though his suggestions were declined.\n\nIn 2014, \"Prog\" readers voted \"Drama\" the 100th best progressive rock album.\n\nYes toured \"Drama\" with a concert tour of North America and the UK from August to December 1980. Horn and Downes had never performed live on such a large scale before, and learned the Yes repertoire with Downes playing 14 keyboards on stage. Horn faced issues with nervousness, as he had never done large-scale touring before, and with his voice, which increasingly strained as the tour progressed due to his efforts to match Anderson's high register. While marketing for the tour was mute on the lineup change, much of the North American leg was still a success. The tour included three sold out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City, where the band were awarded a commemorative award for selling out the venue sixteen consecutive times since 1974. The UK leg, however, was not as well-received with many audience members expressing their anger with the lineup change by booing and shouting at Horn and Downes.\n\nAfter the tour, Yes disbanded in early 1981. Horn began a career in producing while Howe and Downes formed Asia. All five members of the \"Drama\" line-up reunited in the recording of Yes's twentieth album, \"Fly from Here\" (2011). An alternate version of that album, \"Fly from Here – Return Trip\" (2018), features Horn on lead vocals.\n\nYes did not revisit songs from \"Drama\" until Anderson's permanent removal from the band in 2008. For their 2016 European tour, the album was performed in its entirety for the first time, in track order. Horn sang \"Tempus Fugit\" with the band on stage on their Oxford and London dates.\n\nAll songs by Geoff Downes, Trevor Horn, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White, except where noted.\n\nCredits are adapted from the 1980 and 1994 issues of the album.\n\nYes\n\nProduction\n\n"}
