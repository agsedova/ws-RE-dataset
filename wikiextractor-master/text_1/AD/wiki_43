One of Mattel's subsidiaries, Concepts 2000, had the license to produce Battlestar Galactica electronic toys, so it was figured to be a lock that Mattel would get the license to produce the official Battlestar Galactica video game. The game was well into development when they discovered Mattel didn't get the license. The name was changed, but the graphics remained the same. The \"flying saucers\" in the game are actually Cylon Raiders; this is mostly imperceptible, due to the lack of detail that could be used in graphics of the platforms of that era. In addition, squadrons of fighters are launched from a \"base ship\" to defend against the incoming enemy squadrons.\n\nThe 2003 \"Battlestar Galactica\" mini-series inspired a video game for Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox in which the player plays as Commander Adama as a younger man, and flies a number of missions in different craft against Cylon ships, following Adama's career during the First Cylon War. Though presumed set in the continuity of the 2004 reboot, the visuals were based on the designs of the original 1978 series and like the original series, the game featured alien races and their technologies even though no aliens or alien technologies were ever suggested to exist in the 2004 continuity. The game also features the voice talents of Dirk Benedict as Lieutenant Starbuck and Richard Hatch as Captain Apollo, though both characters were hidden content available only through the use of cheat codes and did not feature in the storyline of the main game. It was developed by Warthog Games and it was the last game ever to be published by Universal Interactive, as the company would dissolve shortly after the game's release.\n\nIn 1976, Mattel released a handheld electronic game called \"Missile Attack\", which was later resold as \"\"Battlestar Galactica Space Alert\"\" due to difficulties with NBC who refused to air commercials for the Missile Attack game. \"Battlestar Galactica Space Alert\" was obviously based on the original \"Battlestar Galactica\" film and television series.\n\n\"Cylon Attack\" by A&F Software for the BBC Micro in the 1980s was another game based on the original series.\n\nThe computer game \"Epic\", and its sequel \"Inferno\", released by Ocean software in 1992, featured a similar plot to Battlestar Galactica as well as similar ship models and characters.\n\nSuperscape, a mobile phone entertainment company, announced the launch of an action-game based on the series. Through a licensing deal with Universal Studios Consumer Products Group, the \"Battlestar Galactica\" mobile phone game is available for download now worldwide for Java enabled handsets. It was released for mobile phones in February 2006. The player starts as a rookie pilot. Players take over the controls of the Colonial Viper Mark VII high performance fighter, and are quickly drawn into the ongoing interstellar war. Fighting their way through 20 levels and a variety of missions, players battle with the deadly Cylons.\n\nA \"Battlestar Galactica\" game based on the new series was released for Xbox Live Arcade and Microsoft Windows on October 24, 2007. The game was developed by Sierra/Sierra Online and Auran.\n\nThe Xbox Live Arcade Game takes the player through the major fights of the first two seasons of the show as a Viper pilot, it also incorporates multiple achievements and online multiplayer, not to mention unusual abilities Colonial and Cylon fighters possess, such as shielding, stealth, and advanced weapons. Reception of the game by critics was moderate; it has received an average score of 55% from major publications. It has been removed from Xbox Live Arcade.\n\nBattlestar Galactica Online is a free-to-play browser-based MMO developed and published by Bigpoint based on the 2004 remake of the television series. Released in open beta on February 8, 2011, BSGO web3D game client was developed atop the Unity Game Development Tool. The game server is written in Erlang. In less than three months of launch, the game surpassed 2 million registered users. \nUnfortunately as of February 2019 Battlestar Galactica Online has been discontinued.\n\nStory\n\nMan created the Cylons. The Cylons evolved. The Cylons Rebelled. The game begins 40 years after the first Cylon war. The Cylons paid a visit to the Twelve Colonies to annihilate the humans and take their resources. The aging Battlestar Galactica managed to escape the attack, gather a fleet of civilian ships, and set out for the home of the legendary 13th Colony (Earth). The Cylons pursued Battlestar Galactica for months until Battlestar Galactica reunited with Pegasus, the other survivor from the Cylon attack. Together, they were strong enough to retaliate and destroy the Cylon's Resurrection Ship.\n\nWhen the Cylons discovered that the humans destroyed the Resurrection Ship, they launched a colossal counter strike against the Colonial Fleet. The unsuspecting Colonials were forced to jump away to safety, but they suffered a mechanical malfunction in the process. A massive pulse of energy overloaded the FTL drives on both fleets, which triggered an uncontrolled jump that threw them off target.\n\nIn Battlestar Galactica Online, the Cylons and Colonials are stranded at the edge of one of the galactic arms. Both Colonial fleets are heavily damaged and low on critical resources. The race begins for the Colonials to repair and rearm their ships, escape and continue their quest for Earth before the Cylons gain enough strength to obliterate them once and for all.\n\nBattlestar Galactica Deadlock is a 3D strategy game (released on PC, Xbox One and PS4) featuring the First Cylon War. The game is developed by the Australian studio Black Lab Games and published by the British developer Slitherine Software. It was originally announced on May 16, 2017 and it opened its closed beta shortly after.\n\nBattlestar Galactica Deadlock takes the player into the heart of the First Cylon War, to fight 3D battles. The player takes control of the Colonial Fleet from the bridge of the mobile shipyard, Daidalos, and free the Twelve Colonies from the Cylon threat.\n\nSince the release of the game in August 31, 2017, the game has had 4 releases of DLC content to expand the content of the game. The first DLC introduced additional ships and weapons while the remaining three DLCs added additional ships, new locations, terrain, and new story missions that occur during and after the main game.\n\nWith the release of the Sin and Sacrifice DLC on March 19, 2019, the creators of Battlestar Galactica Deadlock have announced the end of \"Season 1\" of the game series and a new DLC titled Battlestar Galactica Deadlock: Resurrection which starts season 2, was released on August 29, 2019.\n\nA fan made total conversion for \"FreeSpace 2\" known as \"Beyond the Red Line\" had a demo version released on March 31, 2007. A dogfight space combat simulator, the \"Beyond the Red Line\" demo allows players to play a tutorial, two missions and multiplayer. Although it's not an official licensed product, it has been featured in multiple publications. It has also been updated to allow third-party campaigns, of which there are currently two.\n\nA fan game based on the open source \"FreeSpace 2 engine\" known as \"Diaspora\" began development in May 2008 and was released in September, 2012. It was begun by the majority of the members of the \"Beyond the Red Line\" team, who split off due to creative and management differences. (Official Website)\n\nAs well with other popular scifi shows, there have been several Battlestar Galactica themed sims (simulators) in Second Life. Many have been centered on the rag-tag fleet theme and usually provide themed events, Viper vs. Raider dogfights, and general combat.\n\nBattlestar: Thesis (BSG-82nd) was created by a new team of BSG fans and running under the fair trade rule set by Universal Studios to use BSG content in Second Life. The story is set in the Second Cylon War but with the idea that the colonies didn't fall but survived, with the goal of expanding the BSG universe. The ships and fighters are based on the RDM Series all Mesh build and the sim features the colonial 82nd Recon Fleet consisting of the Battlestar Thesis, Stealth Gunstar Aeon, Heavy Gunstar Cerberus, Support Gunstar Sirius. The Cylon fleet contains the Warstar Cylonica, Strikestar Regen, Strikestar Relic, Cylonbase and Djerba Outpost. BSG 82 RP Sim has a promotional video to show what the sim offers. The sim started in 2011 and is still open today. It is called Sniper Eye: Battlestar Thesis.\n\nUntil December, 2010, there were several active sims based on the Re-imagined Series, with several more under development. These were:\n\nBattlestar Pacifica (BSG-47): The Columbia Class Pacifica was the first of the sims based on the series. It opened in 2007 and was the oldest of the sims that were active as of December, 2010. The Sim restarted their story, having completed their storyline in December 2009. The sim featured a number of ships seen in both series, including a version of the Celestra. As of August 2012, this sim is closed.\n\nBattlestar Mercury (BSG-21): In May 2008, The Battlestar Mercury sim opened and was created by former members of the Pacifica sim. The Mercury, a Mercury Class Battlestar similar to the Pegasus, featured the signature double sided landing decks, which allowed participating residents to land their ship upside down. In January 2010, the Mercury concluded their first story and following a restructure of their leadership, began a new story, this one centered on an original story concept inspired by a prop painting that hung in Commander Adama's quarters. However, as of January, 2011, the second story line was suspended and scrapped due to the situation with NBCUniversal (see below) and began their third story. Like their predecessor, the Mercury sim also featured ships from the Reimagined series, including a version of the Zephyr. \nAs of August 2012, this sim was closed, however, in December 2012, the owners of the sim announced a new, unique version of the Galactica Story called Battlestar Mercury: New Genesis. the story, set 150,000 years after the end of the reimagined series, on modern day Earth, combines elements of the Galactica story and a Hunger Games-style environment that promises to take the story into a new direction unique to the genre. On November 5, 2014, the owners of the Mercury sim, citing the ongoing erosion of interest in the genre, announced the sim's impending closure after six years of existence (Official Website)\n\nBattlestar Universe (BSG-33): Currently inactive. In September 2009, the Columbia Class Battlestar Olympia opened their story. Unlike their predecessors, The Olympia sim was set during the first Cylon War. Several months ago, Battlestar Universe closed their doors and the sim on which play occurred was sold. In early 2011 former owners of the original BSG-33 attempted to revive their project with a slightly changed concept on a homestead instead of a full sim. As of August 2012, this sim is closed.\n\nBattlestar: The Twelve Colonies (BSG-118): In January 2010, this particular BSG sim opened featuring a pre-Cylon attack cityscape as well as a new, non-canon class of Battlestar, the Phoenix. This particular sim differed from others in that when the Cylon attacks occur, the Twelve Colonies were not completely lost, resulting in expanded roleplay potential located on the various Colonies themselves. Set partially in Caprica City, the city contained familiar sets from the series, including the Riverwalk Market and other notable landmarks. This sim closed after Universal Studios' actions against Battlestar Galactica themes in Second Life, but as of August 2012, part of its former administrative team is now working on a new project called Battlestar: Resurrection.\n\nBSG: Exodus (BSG-104): Following a new concept and original story using the re-imagined series as a backdrop, this sim began construction when disputes over owner conduct, fragmented the BSG47 sim for the third time. This sim closed in mid-2012 for reasons unrelated to NBCUniversal's DMCA against Battlestar Galactica intellectual property in Second Life.\n\nAlthough the number of sims have paled in comparison to the Star Trek and Star Wars sims in Second Life, there has been a very dedicated following amongst them. However, in July 2010, NBCUniversal began efforts to have the sims removed from Second Life by claiming an intellectual property infringement by both individual creators and Linden Labs for hosting such work. The initial campaign moved to stop the sale of items such as flyable ships and uniforms from the series made available to residents of second life by a number of vendors, not necessarily related to the sims. Despite the efforts of the various BSG themed sims, Universal began demands that the sims cease and desist using their trademarked images and content in their role-play sims. By December 7, 2010, the majority of the sims had either shut down or changed their content and storylines away from that in the series.\n\nExodus, a newcomer in the BSG fan roleplay world staffed by longtime members of the community, took up the cause and recruited Anthony Hasledge of the 'IFT Sci-Fi Alliance', to open dialogue with licensing executives and resolve the trademark issue. Other former and current BSG sim owners joined the effort, as did players from every quarter of the BSG roleplay community. Their efforts were successful and, so long as the BSG sims in Second Life comply with a set of rules including no sale of any products related to BSG, they are allowed to continue. As of February 5, 2011, Universal has allowed fair-use of intellectual property related to Battlestar Galactica.\n\nIn April, 2011, an announcement was released that the Exodus and Twelve Colonies, who had changed their name to the Tocana Colonies after the controversy, had agreed to a merger that would take place as of April 8, 2011. However, it was later revealed to be an April Fool's Day Hoax.\n\nGame modifications of various games have been made.\n\n\"Battlestar Galactica: Fleet Commander\" is a \"Homeworld 2\" total conversion. Beta versions of \"BSG: Fleet Commander\" are available for Windows and the Macintosh. This is a real-time strategy game in which players command human or Cylon fleets from both the original series and the 2003 reimagined version of the series. It has been mentioned by many gaming publications. Sensretractor, a development team member, has mentioned the work on a Blood and Chrome release. Following the fallout of the NBC cease and desist given to the BSG Nexus mod, further work by the original team on the HWBSG mod was halted when the mod admin and founder retired from the project fearing they too would receive a cease and desist.\n\nThe mod has since been revived by Phoenix Interactive building upon the work of the original team to create a high definition version for the Homeworld 2 re-release.\n\n\"Battlestar Galactica: Edge Of Apocalypse\", before version 2.0 known as \"Battlestar Galactica: Dawn Of War\" is a modification for \"Freelancer\". The first version was released in March 2007 and it has since been frequently updated. The game allows players to pilot colonial or cylon fighters, transport and battleships and engage in space combat, trading or deep space exploration in an attempt to find Earth.\n\n\"Battlestar Galactica – Colonial Wars\" is a \"\" modification. It was featured as the 'Mod of the Month' in the May 2008 issue of \"PC Gamer\". The mod development was finished at version 5.0, as only a semi-conversion; large chunks of Star Wars content remained. Development then focused on a follow-up project, which was set to be a larger, total conversion mod. The mod is set to be completed under a new name, \"Battlestar Galactica: At War\". This uses the same concept for the game, and is set to totally convert Star Wars: Empire at War into Battlestar Galactica. Sadly this mod ceased development and is no longer available. A new sub mod has started up using assets from the Colonial wars mod titled \"Battlestar Galactica: War of the Colonies\". This aims to totally convert the game based around an alternate storyline where the Cylon virus does not work, leading to an all out conventional war between the two sides.\n\nThere are also Battlestar Galactica fan modifications of the games \"Battlefield 1942\", \"Battlefield 2\", \"Battlefield 2142\", \"Homeworld\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"Sins of a Solar Empire\", \"\" and \"\", as well as add-ons for the \"Orbiter Space Flight Simulator\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2241563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241563", "title": "Simply Deep", "text": "Simply Deep\n\nSimply Deep is the debut solo studio album by American singer Kelly Rowland. It was first released through Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment on October 22, 2002 in North America, and by February 3, 2003 throughout most international territories. Recorded within three weeks during the hiatus of her group Destiny's Child and upon the success of worldwide number-one hit single \"Dilemma\", a collaboration with rapper Nelly, the album facilitated Rowland in becoming a viable solo star. The album includes guest appearances from Nelly, Solange Knowles and Joe Budden.\n\n\"Simply Deep\" debuted and peaked at number twelve on the US \"Billboard\" 200, becoming Rowland's lowest-charting album to date, selling 77,000 copies in its first week. It eventually sold 700,000 copies and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2002 but hasn’t been updated since. The album also topped the UK Albums Chart. It garnered two nominations at the TMF Awards in the Netherlands and eventually won both trophies, including Best R&B International Artist. In spite of selling only 700,000 in the U.S. \"Simply Deep\" has sold over three million copies worldwide, becoming Rowland's best-selling album to date.\n\nIn late 2003, nearly a year after \"Simply Deep\"'s initial release, Rowland embarked on a European tour, the Simply Deeper Tour, to promote the album. Visiting seventeen venues, Rowland embarked on the tour in the United Kingdom on September 13, 2003 and concluded it on October 6, 2003 in Paris, France.\n\nRowland launched her singing career with all-female R&B group Destiny's Child in the late 1990s. While recording their third studio album, \"Survivor\", in late 2000, the band announced that members of the group would disband for a short period to produce solo albums in the coming years, which they hoped would boost interest in Destiny's Child. The idea of individual releases emanated from the group's manager, Mathew Knowles. With different types of music for each member to produce, the albums were not intended to compete on the charts as Destiny's Child's management strategically planned to stagger the release of each group member's album to maximize sales. While Michelle Williams became the first to release a debut solo album, \"Heart to Yours\", in April 2002, Knowles debuted on the big screen, starring in the comedy film \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\", and started recording her solo debut \"Dangerously in Love\" (2003). Meanwhile, Rowland collaborated with American rapper Nelly on the song \"Dilemma\" as a solo artist. The single originally appeared on his album \"Nellyville\" (2002), becoming a worldwide number-one hit that year, allowing her label Columbia Records to advance the release date of Simply Deep from 2003 to late 2002.\n\nIn order to capitalize on the success of \"Dilemma\", the singer was forced to complete the album within a month. Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording studios, including Studio 353, The Hit Factory and Sound-on-Sound Studio in New York City, Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta, Audio Vision Recording Studios in Miami Beach, and The Enterprise in Burbank, Henson Recording Studios and The Record Plant in Los Angeles, Heeba Jeeba Studios in Sherman Oaks and the Real FM Sound and Nature's Finest Studios in Hollywood. Several record producers and songwriters collaborated with Rowland on the album, including Damon Elliott, Mark J. Feist, Rob Fusari, Rich Harrison, Teron Beal, Billy Mann, Damon Sharpe, and Robert \"Big Bert\" Smith, the latter who contributed \"Love/Hate,\" a song co-written by fellow singer Brandy. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, wrote and co-produced three songs on \"Simply Deep\".\n\nRowland felt pressured by high expectations due to Destiny's Child and their huge success. \"It was a challenge and I did that creatively and vocally,\" she later revealed, \"I was very nervous, but I came through with flying colors because of my family and, of course, Destiny's Child. There were days in the studio where I would run out, like, 'I'm frustrated! I don't wanna do this!' And they would calm me and tell me that everything was gonna be okay. I got through it because of them.\" Rowland eventually overcame her fears during the process as her newfound independence offered her an opportunity to branch out and try new things. In fact, she co-wrote three songs on the album and came up with the vocal arrangements for several tracks. Musically, the album took Rowland's solo work further into a pop-rock and R&B sound, which she described as a \"weird fusion [of] a little bit of Sade and a little bit of rock.\"\n\n\"Simply Deep\" was released through Columbia Records in collaboration with Music World Music on October 28, 2002 in both the United States and Canada. The album would not be released worldwide until February 3, 2003. The album yielded three singles; \"Stole,\" a pop rock -influenced mid-tempo track about school bullying, was released as the album's lead single. The song entered the top 20 on the majority of the charts it appeared on, reaching the top five in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it remains her highest-charting solo single to date.\n\nAlthough \"Dilemma\" was not technically the lead single from the album, it was the first song on the album recorded and released before Rowland even began the process of recording the album. \"Dilemma\" was generally well received by critics. It was number one in ten countries, including the UK, the US and Australia, selling over 7.6 million copies worldwide also becoming Rowland's first number one single as a solo artist, her highest charting and most successful single to date and her biggest international hit. \"Stole\" was released as the album's lead single in October 2002, following the worldwide success of \"Dilemma\", it entered the top twenty on the majority of the charts it appeared on but only a moderate hit compared to its predecessor. \"Can't Nobody\" was released as the album's second single (3rd overall) although it widely failed to match the success of \"Dilemma\" or \"Stole\". \"Train on a Track\", was the final track released from the album and only entered the top twenty on the UK Singles Chart, although it was featured on the soundtrack to the romantic comedy film \"The Seat Filler\" and \"Maid in Manhattan\".\n\nUpon its release, \"Simply Deep\" received generally mixed to lukewarm reviews from most music critics. British morning newspaper \"The Independent\" gave the album a generally favorable review, writing that \"on the whole the album sticks closely to the standard urban-diva formula, mixing garage twitchers with the usual billing and cooing on ballads such as \"Haven't Told You\". But it's all done with style and intelligence, whether she's luxuriating in the loneliness of \"Everytime You Walk Out That Door\" or evoking the momentum of the first flush of love in \"Train on a Track\".\" Lisa Verrico of \"The Times\" stated \"on first listen, \"Simply Deep\" does everything but live up to its title. It sounds like a shallow stroll through the poppier end of urban music [...] But give it another listen and [it] does grow on you if you’re looking for an easy-on-the-ear album. It is a pleasant listen.\" Joy Dunbar, writing for BBC Music, noted that while \"the albums main weakness is that it tries to offer too much diversity and Kelly tries too hard to stand outside her former incarnation,\" it was a must-have for fans of R&B music, adding: \"\"Simply Deep\" endeavours to demonstrate another side of Kelly Rowland, as a songwriter and an independent solo artist [...] The in frequent high points make this a must for your collection.\"\n\nIn her review for \"Simply Deep\", Caroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" wrote, \"Rowland is no longer a mere backing vocalist for Beyoncé Knowles. But while she undoubtedly has talent to burn, her first solo album is a mildly disappointing setting for it. A top-flight example of the American inclination toward lush but lightweight soul, it makes all the right R&B noises without engaging the emotions.\" She gave it three out of five stars. Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant\" dismissed the ballads on \"Simply Deep\" as \"all gloppy-goo and no soul; but through it all Rowland manages to keep her cool. The album's best tracks, the light and breezy \"Train on a Track\" and \"(Love Lives In) Strange Places,\" infuse the singer's lush harmonies with acoustic guitars and poetic wordplay.\" He especially criticized Solange Knowles' contribution to the album, noting her \"icky [and] laughable lyrics\" as the worst on \"Simply Deep\" which he rated two and a half out of five stars. Jon Caramanica of \"Entertainment Weekly\" commented that \"Rowland, at times, seems like Destiny's adopted child, never receiving a full helping of Knowles-family adulation. Alas, her first solo project doesn't pull her out from Beyonce's shadow. She needs added star power: Her backup-singer instincts leave even the hottest songs here feeling somewhat chilly.\" Craig Seymour of \"Vibe\" was generally disappointed with the album, writing: \"Rowland's solo album marks an attempt to further establish herself as a singular talent, but the effort is as misguided as the Nelly hookup was savvy [...] An abundance of cheesy folk/R&B numbers make Rowland come off like Brandy fronting as India.Arie.\" He gave \"Simply Deep\" one and a half out of five stars.\n\n\"Dilemma\" was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Record of the Year at the 45th Grammy Awards (2003), winning the award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. During the 55th Anniversary of the Hot 100 issue of \"Billboard\" magazine, the song was ranked at number 75 on the all-time Hot 100 songs while at the end of 2009 was named the eleventh most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. \"Dilemma\" was accredited internationally with sixteen certifications. The song also appears on the game \"Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol\".\n\n\"Simply Deep\" peaked at number twelve on the \"Billboard\" 200, the official albums chart in the United States, on November 9, 2002, selling 77,000 units in its first week of release. Simultaneously, the album also charted on the \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums tally, reaching number three behind LL Cool J's \"10\" (2002) and Gerald Levert's \"The G Spot\" (2002). By the end of the year, \"Simply Deep\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It went on to sell more than 600,000 copies in the US.\n\nReleased to even bigger success in international territories, in the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number-one on the UK Albums Chart on February 15, 2003, selling more than 100,000 copies in its first week. It received both a silver and a gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) the following week, and by April 2011, had been certified platinum for shipping 300,000 units. \"Simply Deep\" also reached the top spot on the Irish Albums Chart and was certified gold by the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA). Elsewhere in Europe, the album managed to enter the top ten in Denmark and the top twenty in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. Across Oceania, it placed fifth and seventh on the Australian and the New Zealand Albums Chart, in the week of January 26, 2003, and was certified gold by both the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).

The film stars the famous duo of Kapoor and Nargis as well as Prem Nath. It was also the introduction of actress Nimmi in her first film role. \"Barsaat\" was one of the first major hit films directed by Kapoor. This success allowed Kapoor to buy RK Studios in 1950.\n\nThe film revolves around two love stories. Pran (Raj Kapoor) and Reshma (Nargis) and Gopal (Prem Nath) and Neela (Nimmi). Two friends with opposite personalities, the rich but sensitive Pran and the womanizing Gopal both have affairs with two mountain girls while holidaying in the valley of Kashmir. While Pran and Reshma's love is true and reciprocated, Gopal is a womanizing villain, who disregards the faithful Neela (Nimmi) and condemns her to wait faithfully for his return with the barsaat (rainy season).\nMany plot intrigues follow through with Pran and Reshma facing many trials on the path to true love, including parental opposition, accidents and an attempted forced marriage of Reshma to an uncouth fisherman. The couple are finally reunited.\n\nGopal on the other hand finally becomes a reformed character and rushes to claim the ever faithful Neela who has been pining away, only to arrive to find his true love dead. The film ends with Gopal lighting Neela's funeral pyre as the rains finally come.\n\nThe much acclaimed poster and publicity for the movie were illustrated by the master artist Dr S. M. Pandit. One of the posters showing the heroine dangling on the arm of the hero would go on to inspire the R K Studios' famous logo.\n\nThe music of \"Barsaat\" became famous upon the film's release in 1949. The film was the debut for music directors Shankar Jaikishan and established their careers. The famous playback singer Lata Mangeshkar famously sang for both Nargis and Nimmi in \"Barsaat\".\n\nThe soundtrack was listed by Planet Bollywood at number 1 on their list of the 100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks.\nRakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood gave 10 stars stating, \"Barsaat is ideally one of Hindi cinema's best soundtracks\".\n\n"}

It retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6).\n\nIt was published in US by Dodd, Mead and Company in February 1939 under the title of Murder for Christmas. This edition retailed at $2.00. A paperback edition in the US by Avon books in 1947 changed the title again to A Holiday for Murder. The book features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and is a locked room mystery.\n\nMost reviews at the time of publication were positive, referring to \"the brilliance of the whole conception\", and remarking that \"never has his [Poirot's] mighty brain functioned more brilliantly\". Another considered this novel to be \"a major Christie\" and stated that \"the rules were not made for Agatha Christie.\" One reviewer analysed the novel in some detail, considering this and recent novels to have too much of a pattern in the plot and felt that Poirot was \"becoming too much of a colourless expert.\" A later review by Barnard was terse, \"Magnificently clued.\" \n\nMulti-millionaire Simeon Lee, frail in his old age, unexpectedly invites his family to gather at his home for Christmas. The gesture is met with suspicion by the guests. Simeon is not given to warm family sentiment, and the family are not on good terms, in particular, with the black sheep of the family, Harry. Simeon also searched out his orphaned, Spanish-born granddaughter, Pilar Estravados, to live in his house. None have met their late sister Jennifer's daughter before; she proves to be delightful. Simeon is intent on playing a cruel game with his family's emotions. Stephen Farr ,a surprise guest, arrives on Christmas Eve. He is the son of Simeon's former partner in the diamond mines, welcomed warmly by Simeon. Simeon calls his family together that afternoon, to hear him on the telephone with his attorney, saying he wants to update his will after Christmas. This incomplete information stirs up negative feelings among his sons and their wives.\n\nAfter dinner on Christmas Eve, the sounds of crashing of furniture and a hideous scream are heard by several, who rush to Simeon's room. When they get to his door, they find it locked and have to break it down. The sight revealed includes heavy furniture overturned, crockery smashed, and Simeon dead, his throat slit, in a great pool of blood, a grisly and shocking sight. The local police superintendent is already at the front door, before anyone could call the police. Superintendent Sugden notices Pilar pick up something from the floor. He insists that she give the small bit of rubber and a small object made of wood to him.\n\nSugden explains that he is at the house by prior arrangement with the victim, who confided to him the theft of a substantial quantity of uncut diamonds from his safe. Poirot accompanies Colonel Johnson to investigate this murder. The murder generates many questions. How was the victim killed inside a locked room? Was the murder connected to the theft of the diamonds? And what is the significance of the small triangle of rubber and the peg first noticed by Pilar?\n\nPoirot's investigation explores the victim's methodical and vengeful nature and the way these characteristics come out in his sons, and observes physical traits as well. Each son, and perhaps one of the wives, appears as a suspect to the investigators. When the butler mentions his confusion about the identities of the house guests, Poirot realises that the four sons of Simeon's marriage may not be Simeon's only sons present in the home. Poirot finds the uncut diamonds mixed in with the stones of a decorative outdoor garden, which takes theft away as a motive. The family lawyer reads Simeon's will, which leaves half to son Alfred, who runs the business, and the other half to be split among his other children. This leaves Pilar with nothing, as her mother died a year earlier, and his granddaughter is not specifically named. Alfred, David and Harry agree to pool their inheritances and make a share for Pilar. This warm gesture, based on what is just, as Lydia tells her, upsets Pilar, and she refuses it. The final major clue comes from Pilar. She and Stephen are playing with balloons and one bursts; she mentions that the pieces are like what she found on the floor after Simeon Lee was killed. Poirot warns her to be \"on her guard\", as she knows more than she realises. Soon she is almost killed in another murder attempt, of a stone cannonball perched above her bedroom door.\n\nA cable comes from South Africa reporting that the son of Simeon’s partner was dead; Stephen Farr admits his name is Stephen Grant, and he is in England to meet his father, from Simeon's last trip to South Africa, five years after his marriage in England. After that, Pilar reveals the story of the death of the real Pilar as the two crossed Spain during its civil war, and her own plan to arrive in England in her stead. With this knowledge, Sugden tries to blame the murder on Pilar. Then Poirot takes over and explains the crime. Poirot reveals that Sugden was another illegitimate child of Simeon, from an affair with a local girl. Sugden hated the man who abandoned his mother, paying her off. Sugden planned his revenge carefully and murdered his father hours before he set off the noisy sound effects.\n\nDavid is relieved of his years of anger toward his father for mistreating his mother. Stephen takes Pilar, now Conchita Lopez, to South Africa, to marry her. Lydia will invite them to a proper English Christmas.\n\n\nLike \"Appointment with Death\" (1938) before it, this is a novel in which the parent/victim was a sadistic tyrant, whose nature leads directly to his/her murder. This theme arises in later Christie works, such as \"Crooked House\" (1949) and \"Ordeal by Innocence\" (1958).\n\nIn some editions, the novel is headed by an epigraph from \"Macbeth\" that appears repeatedly in the novel itself: \"Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\", a statement made by Simeon Lee's daughter-in-law, Lydia, after Simeon's corpse is found by his family.\n\nIn \"The New York Times Book Review\" of 12 February 1939, Isaac Anderson concluded, \"Poirot has solved some puzzling mysteries in his time, but never has his mighty brain functioned more brilliantly than in \"Murder for Christmas\"\".\n\nIn \"The Observer\" of 18 December 1938, \"Torquemada\" (Edward Powys Mathers) finished his review by stating defensively, \"'Is Hercule Poirot's Christmas' a major Christie? I think it is, and that in spite of a piece of quite irrelevant tortuosity in the matter of the bewitching Pilar Estravados, and in spite of the fact that the business of the appalling shriek will probably make no mystery for the average reader. The main thing, is, surely that Agatha Christie once more abandonedly dangles the murderer before our eyes and successfully defies us to see him. I am sure that some purists will reverse my decision on the ground that the author to get her effect, has broken what they consider to be one of the major rules of detective writing; but I hold that in a Poirot tale it should be a case of caveat lector, and that the rules were not made for Agatha Christie.\"\n\nE R Punshon of \"The Guardian\", in his 13 January 1939 review wrote that Poirot, \"by careful and acute reasoning is able to show that a convincing case can be made out against all the members of the family till the baffled reader is ready to believe them all guilty in turn and till Poirot in one of his famous confrontation scenes indicates who is, in fact, the culprit. In this kind of detective novel, depending almost entirely for its interest on accuracy of logical deduction from recorded fact and yet with the drama played out by recognisable human beings, Mrs Christie remains supreme. One may grumble…that she depends a little too much upon coincidence and manufactured effect…but how small are such blemishes compared with the brilliance of the whole conception!\"\n\nMaurice Percy Ashley in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" (17 December 1938) had a complaint to make after summarising the plot: \"Mrs Christie's detective stories tend to follow a pattern. First, there is always a group of suspects each of whom has something to conceal about his or her past; second, there is a generous use of coincidence in the circumstances of the crime; third, there is a concession to sentiment which does not necessarily simplify the solution. Mrs Christie makes one departure here from her recent practice, as she explains in her dedicatory foreword. The complaint had been uttered that her murders were getting too refined – anaemic, in fact. So this is 'a good violent murder with lots of blood.' But there is, on the other hand, another departure from Mrs Christie's earlier stories which must be regretted. M. Poirot in his retirement is becoming too much of a colourless expert. One feels a nostalgic longing for the days when he baited his 'good friend' and butt, Hastings, when he spoke malaprop English and astonished strangers by his intellectual arrogance.\"\n\nRobert Barnard summarized the novel as a \"Welcome interruption to the festive season as mischievous old patriarch, tyrant and sinner gets his desserts.\" His judgment of the novel was stated in two words: \"Magnificently clued.\"\n\nThe character of Colonel Johnson previously appeared in \"Three Act Tragedy\" (1935) and he mentions that case in Part 3, section v of this novel.\n\n\nThe book was first serialised in the US in \"Collier's Weekly\" in ten parts from 12 November 1938 (Volume 102, Number 20) to 14 January 1939 (Volume 103, Number 2) under the title \"Murder For Christmas\" with illustrations by Mario Cooper.\n\nThe UK serialisation was in twenty parts in the \"Daily Express\" from Monday, 14 November to Saturday, 10 December 1938 under the title of \"Murder at Christmas\". Most of the instalments carried an uncredited illustration. This version did not contain any chapter divisions.\n\nThe story was adapted for television in 1994 in a special episode of \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\" starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. The adaptation is generally faithful to the novel, although some characters have been left out. Chief Constable Colonel Johnson, who features in the novel, is replaced in the television adaptation by regular Poirot character Chief Inspector Japp. Stephen Farr is also missing, and his romantic interests in Pilar are given to Harry. Hilda and David Lee do not appear in the adaptation. The exterior scenes were filmed in Chilham, Kent and Chilham Castle was used as Gorston Hall. A small backstory is given explaining Poirot's reluctance to go, due to the fact that he stays at home at Christmas and prefers central heating. But his radiator has given out and the attendants at Whitehaven Mansions won't repair it until after Christmas. Before he leaves, he asked Simeon Lee if they have central heating.\n\nCast:\n\nThe story was also adapted for the French television in a four-parts series entitled \"Petits Meurtres en famille\", broadcast by France 2 in 2006 and 2009, with the notable replacement of Poirot by a duet of newly created characters. Mathew Prichard himself, grandson of Agatha Christie, was quoted by Télérama as calling it the best TV adaptation he had seen.\n\n\"Hercule Poirot's Christmas\" was adapted for radio by BBC Radio 4, featuring Peter Sallis as Poirot. This was the second adaptation of a Poirot story for radio, aired 24 December 1986.\n\n"}

{"id": "2241583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241583", "title": "Informationist", "text": "Informationist\n\nAn informationist (or \"information specialist in context\") provides research and knowledge management services in the context of clinical care or biomedical research. \n\nAlthough there is no one educational pathway or formalized set of skills or knowledge for informationists, one way to think of the informationist is as one who possesses the knowledge and skill of a medical librarian with extensive research specialization and some formal clinical or public health education that goes beyond on-the-job osmosis.\n\nMedical librarians and other biomedical professional organizations have been exploring the possibilities for evaluating how informationists are being used and whether their activities supplement or replace medical library activity.\n\nMore generally, an informationist is a professional who works with information within a particular business, analytic or scientific context to drive toward outcomes based on evidence, analysis, prediction and execution. For example, an extension of the term is increasingly emerging in financial services, life sciences and health care industries. Though still nascently in use, its adoption applies to individuals with extensive industry expertise, acute familiarity with organizational structures and processes, deep domain level information mastery and information systems technical savvy. Informationists in this context support transformational initiatives within and across functional areas of an enterprise as architects, governance experts, continuous improvement advocates and strategists.\n\nThe term was proposed in 2000 by Davidoff & Florance. Their editorial suggested that physicians should be delegating their information needs to informationists, just as they currently order CT scans from radiologists or cardiac catheterizations from cardiologists. They conceived of an information professional who was embedded in (and indeed, supported by) the clinical departments.\n\nSupporters of the concept see it as a means for librarians to reinvigorate connections with the faculty/clinicians, as well as provide superior service by dint of informationists' biomedical training. Critics complained that the idea is nothing new (perhaps most famously in an article entitled \"So what are we? Chopped liver?\"); librarians already provide in-depth, high quality information services and clinical medical librarians have been working alongside physicians, nurses and other clinicians for years.\n\nLarge informationist programs in the U.S. exist at the National Institutes of Health and at Vanderbilt University. Welch Medical Library at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is developing an informationist service model in which its 10 clinical and public health librarians are moving from serving as liaison librarians for assigned departments toward becoming embedded informationists within their departments.\n\nTo prepare for the embedded informationist role, librarians are undertaking education as needed to supplement their backgrounds. For example, librarians bring experience in clinical behavior counseling, public health, nursing, and more. Informationist training can then focus upon filling gaps in research methods knowledge more so than on gaining additional knowledge in the librarian's area of expertise. Courses, seminars and workshops being undertaken include those covering systematic reviews, evidence-based medicine, critical appraisal, medical language, anatomy and physiology, biostatistics, and clinical research.\n\nThe term informationist is related to that of informatician—also informaticist—and many informationists do possess skills in clinical topics, bioinformatics, and biomedical informatics. Harvard University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Washington University in St. Louis are examples of institutional libraries which have hired PhD-level scientists (who may or may not have library degrees) to provide informatics support for biomedical research.\n\n"}

Since the original series, there have been many spin-offs based on the show, including additional animated series, video games, and films.\n\nThe franchise follows the adventures of a powerful but dimwitted cyborg police inspector named Gadget as he investigates the criminal schemes of Dr. Claw and his organization, M.A.D., as they fruitlessly attempt to stop him. However, neither side is aware that it is Gadget's niece, Penny, and her dog, Brain, who are truly responsible for thwarting M.A.D.\n\nThe main protagonist and titular character of the franchise. Gadget is a cyborg (part man, part machine) with thousands of high-tech gadgets installed in his body. Gadget is very powerful and loyal to his career as a lawman, but he is also very dim-witted, clueless, incompetent, oblivious, and gullible, but also lovable, caring, and protective. His attire and personality resemble those of Maxwell Smart (also portrayed by Don Adams) from the \"Get Smart\" TV show.\n\nWhile Penny and Brain secretly do all the real detective work, Gadget has a knack of inadvertently saving the day, usually without realizing he is doing so. Gadget loves his family more than anything and would do anything to keep them from harm, especially Penny. He was voiced by Don Adams in the original series and \"Inspector Gadget's Field Trip\" until Adams' retirement from voicing Gadget in 1999, Gary Owens and later Jesse White in the original series' pilot episode, and Maurice LaMarche in the \"Super Mario Bros. Super Show\", \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", the direct-to-video animated films, and various DIC Kids Network bumpers. For the 2015 series, the voice of Gadget is provided by Ivan Sherry. It is revealed in the first live action film that Gadget's real name is Jonathan \"John\" Brown. He is portrayed by Matthew Broderick in the first film and French Stewart in the sequel.\n\nDr. Claw is the main antagonist of the franchise. He is the leader of an evil crime syndicate called M.A.D. Only his arms are shown, wearing silver gauntlets with golden spiked wrist bands. A parody of Ernst Stavro Blofeld from the James Bond franchise, his face is never seen at all (except in the live action film) with only his hands and pet cat visible. On a Dr. Claw action figure, the face was covered by a sticker on the box, which meant the toy had to be bought for his face to be seen. He is ruthless, murderous, sinister, dark, sadistic, and greedy, and will do anything to rule the world and destroy Gadget. In \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", he reveals that he thinks Gadget's idiocy is an act to taunt him. In the 2015 series, he is noticeably less competent and malicious and the crimes he commits are a lot more petty. He has been voiced by Frank Welker, Don Francks, Brian Drummond, Doug Rand, and Martin Roach. In the first live action film his name is revealed to be Sanford Scolex and he is portrayed by Rupert Everett. Tony Martin subsequently took over the role of Dr. Claw in the sequel.\n\nPenny is Gadget's intelligent niece and the one who really stops Dr. Claw's evil schemes. She uses many high tech devices to help her secretly solve the cases and stop the bad guys such as a computer book, a video watch, a laptop, and a holographic tablet. However, her meddling often leads to her getting captured by the villains, which leaves Brain to rescue her. She is 10 in the original series, 12 in \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", 16 in \"Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever\", and 14 (later turning 15) in the 2015 series. Penny loves her uncle more than anything, which is why she is always ready to help him behind his back, but on a few occasions she gets annoyed by his stupidity. In \"Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever\", she is notably more selfish and unlike any other incarnation, she doesn't try to help her uncle at all. In the 2015 series, she has become an agent in training, is more physically active than in previous incarnations and she has a crush on Dr. Claw's nephew, Talon.\n\nFor the original series, her voice was portrayed by Mona Marshall in the pilot episode, Cree Summer in the first season, and Holly Berger in the second season. Erica Horn provided her voice in \"Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas\". From 2001 to 2005, she was voiced by Tegan Moss. Tara Strong voices her in the 2015 series. In the first live action film she is portrayed by Michelle Trachtenberg. Caitlin Wachs portrays her in the sequel.\n\nBrain is Penny's dog. He is the only one who knows that Penny is the one who really saves the world. Brain usually has the job of keeping Gadget safe on his missions while Penny investigates M.A.D's crimes. He usually disguises himself when following Gadget, which often causes Gadget to think he's a M.A.D Agent. He is absent in \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\" and only shows up in pictures. The reason given for why he is absent is because after all the years of secretly helping Gadget, he has become phobic of gadgets, Gadget, and the word itself. He ran away to a riverside shack to get away from Gadget. He returned in the episode, \"No Brainer\", where Penny made him a translation collar in order to help find Gadget. However, he does return in later spinoffs.\n\nHis voice was played in the original series by Frank Welker, Maurice LaMarche in \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", and Scott McCord in the 2015 series. Lee Tockar voiced him in \"Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever\". In the first live action film he is voiced by Don Adams. In the sequel he is voiced by Jeff Bennett.\n\nChief Quimby is Gadget's boss and the chief of police. He usually pops up near the beginning of each episode to give Gadget a sheet of paper describing his mission. Once Gadget finishes reading them, the paper self-destructs and blows up in Quimby's face in a parody of \"\". He appears at the end to congratulate Gadget and give him full credit for stopping Dr. Claw. He is unaware that Penny did all the work, even though she always calls him. In \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", he has become an agent for the CIA. In the 2015 series, he is given glasses, and his hair is blonde instead of brown.\n\nHis voice in the original series was provided by John Stephenson in the pilot, Dan Hennessey in the first season, and Maurice LaMarche for the remainder of the series. Jim Byrnes voiced him in \"Inspector Gadget's Last Case\". He is voiced by Derek McGrath in the 2015 series. In the first live action film he is portrayed by Dabney Coleman. Mark Mitchell portrays him in the sequel.\n\nThe original animated television series in the franchise, \"Inspector Gadget\", debuted in 1983 and introduced audiences to the adventures of a clumsy, simple-witted bionic detective named Inspector Gadget – a human being with various bionic gadgets built into his body. Gadget's nemesis is Dr. Claw, the leader of an evil organization, known as \"M.A.D.\"\n\n\"Inspector Gadget\" was the first TV series from DiC Entertainment to be produced directly for syndication. Its two seasons originally ran from 1983 to 1986 and remained in syndication into the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1992, DiC produced an animated Christmas special based on the series, \"Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas.\" In the special, Dr. Claw has locked up Santa Claus at the North Pole and hypnotized his elves, forcing them to break all toys that are being produced. Inspector Gadget, Penny, and Brain travel to the North Pole in an attempt to stop Dr. Claw and save Christmas. This special was nominated for an Emmy. Don Adams, Frank Welker, Erica Horn and Maurice LaMarche provide the voices for the characters.\n\nThe 1995 \"Gadget Boy and Heather\" series was a spinoff from the original show. The series is about a younger version of Gadget, \"Gadget Boy\" (also voiced by Don Adams). Instead of Penny and Brain the Dog, Gadget Boy was assisted by the resourceful Heather (voiced by Tara Strong). Just as maladroit as his adult self is, Gadget Boy was usually bailed out of situations by the more practical Heather, though he was also helped greatly by his myriad of high-tech gadgets and extendable arms and legs. In this series, traditional nemesis Dr. Claw was replaced by the villainess Spydra. In addition, the chief, Strombolli had a \"fax tie\" that exploded after the mission was read, continuing the running gag from the original series in which Chief Quimby would get blown up by an exploding message.\n\nTwo years later, in 1997, \"Gadget Boy & Heather\" spawned an educational spinoff, \"Gadget Boy's Adventures in History\", which aired on The History Channel. This series marked the last time Don Adams would perform a voice role for an animated Gadget series two years before his retirement from voicing an animated Gadget in 1999 and eight years before his death in 2005.\n\nIn 1996, Gadget took students around the world in this series of 50 field trips, mainly created to market to stations to fulfill the FCC E/I requirements. The show put an animated Inspector Gadget on top of live-action filming of the locations that Gadget guided viewers through. Don Adams returned as Gadget's voice while Penny, Brain, Chief Quimby, Capeman and Dr. Claw are entirely absent.\n\nIn 2002, the French studio SIP Animation (Saban International Paris), in cooperation with DiC, produced 52 episodes of the then-new TV series \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis.\" The series debuted on Channel 5 in the UK in August 2002, followed by French channel M6 in September 2002 and then on Fox Kids channels across Europe from 2003. It was planned to air in the United States on Fox Family, but after the Channel was acquired by Disney in 2001 it never did and so it has never aired in the United States.\n\nInspector Gadget (again voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is now a member of an organization called \"WOMP\" (World Organization of Mega Powers) and is now, Lieutenant Gadget. He is still aided in his work by Penny (who is now twelve years old), as well as the new robot characters Digit and Fidget, the titular Gadgetinis invented by Penny, due to Brain running away. It follows the same plot as the original series, with the dim-witted Gadget attempting to fight crime on his own, while Penny and her helpers secretly do all the work. Dr. Claw, now with the first name George, returns as the main villain, with his relatives introduced in some episodes. In some stories, he is replaced by other villains.\n\nThe production values of this series were higher than any of the previous revivals and spinoff series. Also, the original creators of \"Inspector Gadget\" were all involved: Andy Heyward was one of the executive producers; Jean Chalopin wrote or co-wrote all the episodes, in addition to being credited as the new show's creator; whereas Bruno Bianchi directed and produced the series.\n\nA new computer-animated \"Inspector Gadget\" TV series had been in development since at least the start of 2012, possibly earlier. It was commissioned by Teletoon Canada, which aired the show, and put into preproduction by The Cookie Jar Company. In January 2012, the then-in-development show was mentioned by Ray Sharma, the CEO of XMG Studio, which produced the hit mobile game \"Inspector Gadget: M.A.D. Dash\". Sharma described how the success of the game had resulted in a new TV series having been in the making: \"We did 1 million downloads in a week, and it's reinvigorated the TV brand with a new TV series in production.\"\n\nIn September 2012, Cookie Jar issued a short press release about the then-upcoming series, as part of the advertising for it during the MIPCOM market that October, stating: \"Cookie Jar Entertainment is celebrating Inspector Gadget’s 30th anniversary with the launch of a brand-new series with its Canadian broadcast partner TELETOON. The series will again revolve around the iconic bionic bumbling detective.\" On June 9, 2013, Teletoon officially announced the reboot show with two press pictures of Gadget's new look as well as a press release: \"MAD Agents, look out! Criminals, beware! Bystanders … take cover! Inspector Gadget is back to battle Dr. Claw with all-new gadgets – and all-new gadget-related chaos. But the loveable, bumbling, accidentally-destructive Inspector is not alone in the fight to take down MAD. His ever trusty police-dog, Brain, is still by his side and he's getting extra crime-fighting help from his new partner, Inspector-in-training Penny (voiced by Tara Strong). With MAD more powerful than ever and with the arrival of Dr. Claw's evil-genius (and totally crush-worthy) nephew, Penny and Brain will need to use every ounce of their training to keep the world safe from Dr. Claw … and Gadget.\"\n\nUnlike the other shows, Penny is more of the protagonist and Dr. Claw is as incompetent and useless as Gadget (if not more so). The series was produced by DHX Media, which purchased Cookie Jar in 2012. According to a DHX Media distribution catalogue released as a PDF on January 15, 2014, the show premiered in 2015 on Netflix.\n\nOn December 4, 2014, it was announced that the series has 26 episodes and that it would air on Boomerang's international channels in 2015. The series premiered on Boomerang in Australia on January 5, 2015.\n\n\"Inspector Gadget\" was adapted into a 1999 live action film by Walt Disney Pictures, starring Matthew Broderick as the title character and Rupert Everett as Dr. Claw. As opposed to the animated series, where Gadget is bumbling and clueless and Dr. Claw's face is never shown, Gadget appears to be more reliable and competent in detective work and Dr. Claw's face appears many times in the film.\nA second film, \"Inspector Gadget 2\" featured many changes from the first one, such as Doctor Bradford no longer assisting Gadget or being his romantic interest, instead being replaced by a well-meaning and upbeat scientist named Baxter and a new romantic interest named G2. Being a year later in the movie's timeline, Gadget had begun displaying his cartoon namesake's glitches by receiving the wrong gadget when he calls out a specific device. He falls in love with his intended replacement: the fully robotic G2. Furthermore, none of the cast from the first film returned to their roles except D.L. Hughley. Unlike the first film it was direct-to-video.\n\nReleased on VHS in 1999 to coincide with Disney's live action theatrical film, \"Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets\" takes the format of a clip show in which Gadget has a flashback to his past adventures in the original TV series, using footage from the episodes \"The Capeman Cometh\", \"Prince of the Gypsies\", and \"Gadget's Gadgets\"; as well as some stock footage from \"Inspector Gadget's Field Trip\" for the present-day segments. Maurice LaMarche did Inspector Gadget's voice in the modern segments, marking his first cartoon voice appearance as Gadget, who had previously been voiced by Don Adams. Original series actors Cree Summer and Frank Welker reprised their roles as Penny, Brain and Dr. Claw in the modern segments.\n\nIn 2002, as part of the \"DIC Movie Toons\" series of movies, DIC released a full-length animated Television film called \"Inspector Gadget's Last Case\", directed by Michael Maliani. It premiered on television on October 6, 2002 on Nickelodeon and was released on DVD and VHS shortly afterward by MGM Home Entertainment.\n\nThe film is about Lt. Gadget giving up his beloved but aging Gadgetmobile, while his archenemy Dr. Claw uses a competing crime fighter to discredit Gadget and cost him his badge. Penny and Brain make appearances as minor supporting characters. In this, Gadget is more competent, yet he is still bumbling, similar to his persona in the pilot episode and his Mathew Broderick counterpart. Even though the film uses the same character designs as the concurrent \"Gadget & The Gadgetinis\" TV series, SIP Animation wasn't involved with the production of this movie. Maurice LaMarche reprised the role of Gadget in this film and Jaleel White voiced the Gadgetmobile. In most European regions, the movie aired on Disney Channel or Toon Disney. In Germany, the film aired on Cartoon Network.\n\n2005's \"Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever\" was the first \"Inspector Gadget\" animated production to be completely rendered using 3D computer animation. It returned Gadget to his familiar trenchcoat from the original series. Brain is also back in his old role, while Penny is now 16 years old. Gadget is again voiced by Maurice LaMarche and Penny and Claw are once again voiced by Tegan Moss and Brian Drummond, while Bernie Mac voices the Gadgetmobile. The plot features Dr. Claw breaking out of jail with the help of a specially hired Scottish agent named Bombaboy. He and Bombaboy seek out a pterodactyl to get revenge on his captors and launch yet another scheme to conquer the world. Production on the film was announced on May 2004, under the working title \"Inspector Gadget Saves the Day... Maybe\", and the film was released on September 6, 2005 by Lions Gate Home Entertainment.\n\nIn May 2015, It was announced that a new film with a rebooted version of the character is in the works. Like the live-action films, it will be by Disney, with Dan Lin producing it. In October 2019, Mikey Day and Streeter Seidell were hired to write the film.\n\nThe first game developed based on the series was \"Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear\" developed by Beam Software and scheduled for release by Melbourne House in the UK in 1987 for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It resembled the arcade title Metro-Cross and was a left-to-right scrolling racing/jumping game with a quasi-isometric forced 3d perspective. Although the game was completed, and preview copies were reviewed (unfavourably) in the computing press, it was scrapped on the verge of release. The game featured a cameo by the titular character from the Horace series of games. An adventure game based on the series, \"\" was eventually released on the PC in 1990 by a company called Azeroth.\n\nAn LCD Electronic \"Inspector Gadget\" developed by Bandai was released in 1984.\n\nAn NES game was planned for release by Hudson Soft, but was quietly cancelled. Instead, Hudson released an SNES game in 1993 simply called \"Inspector Gadget\". The game features a rare glimpse of Dr. Claw's face.\n\nYears later, Ubisoft released \"\" for the PlayStation and \"\", for the Game Boy Color. DreamCatcher Interactive and Magic Pockets released another game, \"\" for Game Boy Advance.\n\nLight and Shadow Productions also released \"\" for the PlayStation 2 and \"Inspector Gadget Racers\", a racing game for the Game Boy Advance.\n\n\"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\" was the first game based on one of the animated spin-offs and was released for the PlayStation 2 and PC in Europe.\n\n\"Inspector Gadget's MAD Dash\" was released for iOS devices, iPhone and iPod Touch, by XMG Studio in 2010. It features Shuki Levy's original theme music and also includes original voices from the show. In the same game, Doctor Claw reveals his face and is once again given the first name George.\n\nThe original \"Inspector Gadget\" theme song was composed by American composer Shuki Levy (who also wrote the themes for \"Power Rangers\" and \"Digimon\"), and was based on Edvard Grieg's \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\".\n\nSeveral early rap records sampling the \"Inspector Gadget\" theme song were released in 1985. The Kartoon Krew also released \"Inspector Gadget\" on ZYX Music, which contains vocal samples and quotes from the popular cartoon series reenacted by the rap group for the song. Brownsville rap group Bad Boys & K-Love released a record on Starlite Records called \"Bad Boys\" that was featured on the UK hip hop compilation \"Street Sounds Electro 9\". Following the trend, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh used samples from the \"Inspector Gadget\" theme song on their single \"The Show\". The theme song has been heavily sampled in the years since then. California-based punk band Lagwagon recorded a short instrumental cover of the theme song on their 1992 album \"Duh\".\n\nThe new (2015) theme was composed by Canadian film and TV composers Stephen Skratt and Asher Lenz, \"once again using \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" as inspiration\".\n\nA new \"Inspector Gadget\" comic book, based on the original 1983 TV series, was launched in the U.S. by Viper Comics in 2011. A preview issue was published as part of Free Comic Book Day on May 7, 2011; the entire story was then released officially in August as a 48-page comic book titled \"Inspector Gadget: Gadget on the Orient Express\". The comic book was written by Dale Mettam and illustrated by José Cobá. No follow-up issues have been released to date.\n\nOn a 1989 episode of \"The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!\", another DiC production, a live-action bumper segment titled \"\"Defective Gadgetry\"\" had a guest appearance by Inspector Gadget, in which he came to the Mario Bros. for help in repairing him. This was his first live-action appearance predating the 1999 live action film that was released ten years later. Maurice LaMarche (who would assume the voice role in \"\"Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets\"\" ten years later) plays Gadget in this segment. A second live-action segment, \"\"Treasure of the Sierra Brooklyn\"\" had Gadget returning to help the Mario Bros. find a lost treasure.\n\nThe \"Robot Chicken\" episode \"Adoption's an Option\" featured a sketch featuring the \"Inspector Gadget\" characters in a parody of \"The Terminator\". In this sketch, Gadget replaces a faulty part with a Cyberdyne part, only to be turned into an unstoppable killing machine when Skynet goes online. The sketch goes on to revolve around Penny and Brain trying to avoid being killed by the now-evil Gadget, eventually killing him in a factory. Meanwhile, Mad Cat dies of leukemia; at the end of the show, Dr. Claw blames Gadget for Mad Cat's death. Ironically, Dr. Claw claims that he somehow found out it was Penny and Brain who were behind all of Gadget's successful missions, and planned to gain control of Inspector Gadget via Skynet, and use him to kill them using the Cyberdyne technology that gained control of him. (Penny is voiced by Cree Summer and Brain & Dr. Claw by Frank Welker, who were the original voice actors for the characters).\n\n"}

It connects the city of Newport to the city of Woonsocket. Route 114 was a major north–south artery for its entire length until the arrival of the Interstate Highway System. It is still a major commercial corridor on Aquidneck Island and in northern Rhode Island (mainly Central Falls, Cumberland, and Woonsocket).\n\nRoute 114 begins at the Newport city line in the town of Middletown, at an intersection with Route 138 and Broadway. The resultant route 138 continues west into Newport as Admiral Kalbfus Way. Route 114 heads north on West Main Road in Middletown and Portsmouth. In Portsmouth the right lane becomes Route 24 as the left lane curves maintaining Route 114 in Portsmouth, Route 114 turns onto Bristol Ferry Road then crosses Mount Hope Bay into the town of Bristol along the Mount Hope Bridge. In Bristol, it continues north along Ferry Road then shifts to Hope Street. The route then enters the town of Warren, along Main Street through the town center, where it meets and conjoins Route 103. The concurrent route crosses the Palmer and Barrington rivers into the town of Barrington. Routes 114 and 103 continue together along County Road, with Route 114 soon splitting to the north using the Wampanoag Trail. Route 114 eventually reaches the city of East Providence, where the road curves west to meet Route 103 again at Pawtucket Avenue. Along the way, the East Shore Expressway begins at the Wampanoag Trail to connect to I-195. Pawtucket Avenue continues north through downtown East Providence, crossing over I-195, where it is joined by US 1A.\n\nRoutes 1A and 114 continue through the northern part of East Providence towards the city of Pawtucket, with US 1A later splitting off to the north as Route 114 heads northwest into the city of Pawtucket. In Pawtucket, Route 114 splits into a one-way couplet with the northbound direction using Prospect Street and the southbound direction using School Street. After running through several Pawtucket city streets, including an interchange with I-95, Route 114 crosses the Blackstone River and continues north along Broad Street into the city of Central Falls. After crossing the Blackstone River into the town of Cumberland, Route 114 shifts one block east to High Street as it heads towards the village of Valley Falls. The road continues north as Diamond Hill Road towards the rural areas of Cumberland, intersecting I-295 along the way. At the intersection with Route 121, Route 114 turns west along Pine Swamp Road towards the city of Woonsocket. In Woonsocket, Route 114 continues west as Diamond Hill Road, Privilege Street, and Winter Street, ending at Route 122.\n\nTwo sections of modern Route 114 were previously laid out as turnpikes in the early 19th century. In 1805, a charter was granted to the Rhode Island Turnpike corporation, which constructed a road from Portsmouth center to the Bristol Ferry at the north end of Aquidneck Island. The road is now Bristol Ferry Road (Route 114) and Turnpike Avenue. In 1813, the road from northern Pawtucket to the village of Valley Falls in Cumberland was also laid out as a turnpike, known as the Valley Falls Turnpike'. The old road is what is now Broad Street in Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Cumberland.\n\nRoute 114 was an original Rhode Island route designated in 1923, running from Newport to Grants Mills in Cumberland. Until the 1960s, Route 114 ended at the intersection of Pine Swamp Road and Diamond Hill Road in Cumberland. Present-day Route 114 from that point west to Route 122 in Woonsocket, Rhode Island was given the Route 142 and later the Route 11 designation. When Route 11 became Route 121 in the 1960s, Route 121's terminus was cut back to the same intersection where Route 114 originally ended, and the route west to Woonsocket became Route 114.\n\nIn 2000, part of Route 114 northbound south of downtown Pawtucket was re-routed. The old alignment left Prospect Street at Pond Street, went east along Pond Street to Summit Street, north on Summit Street (this turn onto Summit is still signed as of July 2005) and re-joined Route 114 southbound at the corner of Summit Street and Division Street.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2241599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241599", "title": "Verjuice", "text": "Verjuice\n\nVerjuice ( ; from Middle French \"vertjus\" \"green juice\") is a highly acidic juice made by pressing unripe grapes, crab-apples or other sour fruit. Sometimes lemon or sorrel juice, herbs or spices are added to change the flavour. In the Middle Ages, it was widely used all over Western Europe as an ingredient in sauces, as a condiment, or to deglaze preparations. It is still used to some extent in the American South.\n\nIt was once used in many contexts where modern cooks would use either wine or some variety of vinegar, but has become much less widely used as wines and variously flavoured vinegars became more accessible. Nonetheless, it is still used in a number of French dishes as well as recipes from other European and Middle Eastern cuisines, and can be purchased at some gourmet grocery stores. The South Australian cook Maggie Beer has popularised the use of verjuice in her cooking and it is being used increasingly in South Australian restaurants.\n\nModern cooks use verjuice most often in salad dressings as the acidic ingredient, when wine is going to be served with the salad. This is because it provides a comparable sour taste component, yet without \"competing with\" (altering the taste of) the wine, the way vinegar or lemon juice would.\n\nVerjus, called \"husroum\" (حصرم) in Arabic, is used extensively in Syrian cuisine. In Syria, much of the production of \"husroum\" is still done over the course of several days by female members of land-owning clans—even if many of them live in cities. The \"husroum\" produced during this time will be distributed to various households within the extended family and used throughout the year. The same is true for the production of olive oil and tomato paste.\n\nVerjus, called \"ab-ghooreh\" (آب‌غوره) in Persian, is used extensively in Persian cuisine, such as in Shirazi salad.\n\nMaggie Beer, an Australian cook, vintner and food writer, began the modern resurgence of verjuice when she started commercial production in 1984, after a harvest of Rhine Riesling grapes could not be sold. She persuaded a winemaker who was a friend to assist her in turning the juice into verjuice. After slow national sales, 15 years later came international sales, that were then followed in France and elsewhere by local product.\n\nIn domestic cooking, an excellent verjuice can be made more simply from an unripened orange, picked at the point comparable to that in grape verjuice, before the sugar develops. The acidity is clearer and simpler than lemon, fresher than grape verjuice.\n\nNiagara Oast House Brewers in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario developed a farmhouse ale around the use of local Niagara Pinot Noir Verjus with the first release in fall 2015.\n\nThe authors of \"The Medieval Kitchen: Recipes from France and Italy\" write that the grape seeds preserved in salts were also called \"verjus\" during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the French region of Ardèche, a cider fermented from crab apple juice is called \"verjus\". In medieval and early modern English cookery texts \"verjuice\" sometimes means apple juice or crab-apple juice.\n\n"}
{"id": "2241605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241605", "title": "Thomas Baker (artist)", "text": "Thomas Baker (artist)\n\nThomas Baker (9 October 1809 – 10 August 1864) was a Midlands landscape painter and watercolourist often known as \"Baker of Leamington\" or \"Landscape Baker\".\n\nBorn in Harborne, Birmingham, Baker was a student of Vincent Barber (1788–1838) at the Barber family's Charles Street Academy in Birmingham. Exhibiting publicly with the Birmingham Society of Artists from 1827 onwards, he painted landscapes throughout Warwickshire, the Midlands and the Welsh border regions and occasionally producing depictions of the Lake District, Scotland and Ireland. More often than not Baker's landscapes include cattle, although sheep and human figures are also fairly common in his works.\n\nBaker kept comprehensive records of his work and usually signed each major picture \"T Baker\", dated it to the year and numbered it on the back. Smaller pieces, studies and pencil sketches tend to be signed \"T.B.\" (sometimes to be found playfully hidden around gravestones, fenceposts, treeroots etc.) and dated more precisely. His diaries and notes – which contain an 800-strong list of his major works - are held in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery while the art gallery at the Royal Pump Rooms in Leamington Spa has a collection of over sixty Baker landscapes, a couple of which are nearly always on display in the Art Gallery. The art historian Alison Plumridge and local historian Charles Lines have both highlighted how Baker provided artistic tutoring to the local middle classes in order to supplement his earnings from major local patrons such as Lord Leigh. In terms of wider success, Baker exhibited four oil paintings at the Royal Academy between 1831 and 1858 with his work appearing more frequently at the British Institution (where he exhibited 19 paintings) and the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. \n\nAfter his premature death in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, at the age of 55 (amid suggestions of murder that led to the suicide of his housekeeper, Hannah Hewitt), Baker's body was returned to his birthplace and buried in close proximity to the famous Midlands landscape artist David Cox at St. Peter's Church in Harborne, Birmingham.\n\nThe Birmingham-based photographer and landscape painter Edmund Smith-Baker (usually given as E. S. Baker) was the eldest of Baker's five illegitimate children by Elizabeth Alice Smith, a lodging housekeeper from Cubbington. Edmund Smith-Baker ran a studio on Bristol Street in Birmingham together with his younger brother Thomas William, where – alongside the production of carte de visite photographs – he is believed to have completed new and previously unfinished Baker landscapes. Some of these works are signed \"E.S. Baker\" while others display a rather more decorative signature of \"E.S.B\" in which the \"S\" is combined with an enlarged \"B\".\n\nAs a last point of interest with regard to Thomas Baker 'of Leamington', Charles Lines has suggested that, prior to his relationship with Elizabeth Alice Smith, the artist had previously been married at either Leamington All-Saints or Lillington Church and produced two legitimate sons. However, there is no evidence to support this. This assumption is likely based on the two Smith-Baker sons going by the last name of Baker such as E.S. Baker by Edmund Smith-Baker.\n\n\n"}

He pitched for the Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, Washington Nationals, New York Yankees, New York Mets, and Toronto Blue Jays organizations.\n\nRedding was born in Rochester, New York. He graduated from Churchville-Chili Senior High School, then played college baseball at Monroe Community College. He is a grandnephew of actress Joyce Randolph, best known for playing Trixie Norton on \"The Honeymooners\".\n\nIn the 1997 Major League Baseball Draft Redding was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 20th round (610th). In 2000, with the Kissimmee Cobras of the Florida State League, he was 12-5 with a 2.68 ERA in 24 starts and was selected as a Baseball America 2nd team Minor League All-Star, a High-A All-Star, Florida State League All-Star and Florida State League Pitcher of the Year. In 2001, with the Round Rock Express, he was selected as a Double-A All-Star, the Texas League Pitcher of the Year (and All-Star) and again was selected to the Baseball America 2nd team Minor League All-Stars. He was also recognized as the #3 prospect in the Astros system.\n\nHe made his Major League debut on June 24, 2001 against the Cincinnati Reds, pitching six innings and allowing five earned runs. He recorded his first credited win on July 2 in a seven-inning start against the Milwaukee Brewers. He appeared in 13 games, with 9 starts in 2001, finishing 3-1 with a 5.50 ERA. He split 2002 between the AAA New Orleans Zephyrs and the Astros, before becoming a regular part of the Houston rotation in 2003. He made 32 starts that year, finishing 10-14 with a 3.68 ERA. In 2004, he was in 27 games, but only 17 were starts and he was 5-7 with a 5.72 ERA.\n\nOn March 28, 2005 he was traded to the San Diego Padres for Humberto Quintero.\n\nIn 2005, Redding would go 0-5 with a 9.31 ERA in nine games (6 starts) with the Padres, while battling injuries, until he was traded to the New York Yankees with Darrell May for Paul Quantrill. The Yankees starting rotation was hurt by injuries and they decided to take \"a chance\" with Redding. However, his stint with the Yankees would be short lived—he started and lasted one inning against the Boston Red Sox, allowing six runs on four hits and four walks. The next day, he was designated for assignment to allow a spot for pitcher Al Leiter. He spent the rest of the season in AAA with the Columbus Clippers.\n\nIn 2006, Redding spent the entire season in the minor leagues. He signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate, the Charlotte Knights. He became a key component of the Knights' pitching rotation, finishing the 2006 season with a 12-10 record and 3.40 ERA in 29 appearances. He led the team in strikeouts (148) and complete games (5). On September 6, 2006, Redding pitched a four-hit shutout against the Toledo Mud Hens in the International League playoffs. At the end of the season, he opted for minor league free agency, and in November signed a minor-league deal with the Washington Nationals.\n\nIn 2007, with the Nationals, Redding had a rough spring training, allowing 11 runs in 8-2/3 inning, and not making the major league club. At Triple-A Columbus, he compiled a 9-5 record with an ERA of 5.32, by the end of June. The Nationals, beset by injuries to its starting pitching rotation, purchased Redding's contract, and in July he made his first big league start since 2005. He went 5 innings, being tagged with three runs and the loss. He followed that start, however, with a six-inning stint, in which he allowed 2 runs on five hits, and earned his first win as a major leaguer since September 26, 2004, and first as a starter since July 24.\n\nIn 2008, Redding went 10-11 with a 4.95 ERA despite his post-All-Star break slump where he went 3-8 with a 6.92 ERA. Redding also was the victim of seven blown saves, tying for first in the majors. At the season's end, he was non-tendered by the Nationals, making him a free agent.\n\nIn January , Redding signed a one-year, $2.25 million deal with the New York Mets. Going into spring training, Redding was a candidate to be the fifth starter. He struggled in the games that he pitched in and during the middle of spring training he was \"shut down\" due to right shoulder fatigue. It was speculated that his shoulder fatigue was caused by his own error. Redding had offseason foot surgery and he had been rushing back to make sure he had secured a spot in the Opening Day rotation. Tim made his first start of the 2009 season on May 18 against the Los Angeles Dodgers and allowed 2 earned runs over 6 innings.

The film was directed by Rajkumar Santoshi. The movie was initially titled \"Jaan\", later changed to \"Meri Jeet\", then \"Jeet\" and then \"Satwa Asmaan\", before the Deols settled on \"Barsaat\".\n\nBoth Deol and Khanna won the Filmfare Awards in the Best Debut categories. Incidentally, after 10 years, Deol worked in a 2005 film of the same name.\n\nBadal (Bobby Deol) is a naive but intelligent young man who comes from a small village to the big city to attend college. He is introduced to city life by Damru (Harish Patel), who calls himself Danny. When Badal attends college, he meets pretty and precocious Tina Oberoi (Twinkle Khanna) and, after a few misunderstandings and misadventures, they fall in love.\n\nThis relationship is not approved of by Tina's wealthy widower step-dad Dinesh Oberoi (Raj Babbar), who hopes to marry Tina with his friend's (Bharat Kapoor) son. Dinesh complains to the college principal (Vijay Kashyap), that Badal has been responsible for sexually harassing a girl at the college one night, but Tina testifies in favour of Badal and insists he's innocent for the wrongdoing. Dinesh then asks a corrupt cop, Negi, (Danny Denzongpa) the city's assistant commissioner of police, for assistance.\n\nNegi arrests Badal on trumped-up charges and imprisons him. Badal's widowed dad Bhairon (Mukesh Khanna) comes to the big city to try to make sense of why Badal is in prison. Dinesh gives a contract to Negi to have Badal killed. Negi agrees and hires a gang of ruthless outlaws to hunt and kill Badal. He also pressures Tina not to acknowledge and meet Badal anymore, and Tina reluctantly agrees. When she learns that he is not dead, she goes to him. In an effort to save her, Suresh dies and Badal kills Negi. At last, Tina and Badal unite with the dying Dinesh, approving their match.\n\n\nInitially, Shekar Kapur was set to direct this film and had shot a scene with Deol. However, he left the film for \"Bandit Queen\" and Rajkumar Santoshi took over as director. He had both the lead actors attend workshops. While shooting a scene in London, Deol suffered a leg injury and had to use crutches for over a year. He continued shooting for the film \"\" with his injured leg. A few scenes were shot at Rohtang Pass near Manali, Himachal Pradesh. Khanna fainted once while filming there. Reportedly both the lead actors did not go along well during the shooting. Deol irritated Khanna on many occasions and the latter found it \"obnoxious\".\n\nIts total net gross collection was 29 crores and it was declared a \"Super Hit\" grosser by Box Office India. It was also the 5th highest-grossing movie of the year.\n\nThe film score of \"Barsaat\" was composed by Louis Banks while the songs were composed by Nadeem Shravan with lyrics penned by Sameer.\n\nThe songs of the film are popular even in 2020, especially \"Humko Sirf Tumse Pyaar Hai\" and \"Nahin Yeh Ho Nahin Sakta\". \"Hindustan Times\" called the latter song \"the definition of the lovelorn ‘90s\" and \"[s]till the most played song on every desi diljala aashiq’s list\".\n\n\"Barsaat\" was a \"hugely-anticipated film\". Writing for Rediff.com, Sukanya Verma called it \"not a great movie\" but was appreciative of Santosh Sivan's cinematography, especially during the song \"Nahi Yeh Ho Nahi Sakta\", noting that the \"freshness enveloping Sivan’s visuals in the song ... choreographed by Farah Khan, continues to satisfy\" and \"I love the luminously lit frames, the use of fresh paint and mirrors and a gorgeous play of pristine white and bright yellow.\" A review in \"India Today\" noted that the film lacked a script and is \"yet another collection of cliches\". It found the songs \"mediocre\" and concluded with \"[t]he best part is that two stars are born\".\n\n\n"}

When the district was formed, there were only two school buildings. In 1900, only one year of high school work was offered. In 1922, it was expanded to two years; and in 1924, three years were offered. In 1926, Arlington High School was granted a charter as a six-year high school. Its first commencement was held in that year, with only nine students graduating. Since then, there have been an obvious increase in the school's population, almost a total of 4,000 students (2019-2020).\n\nThe Arlingtonian is the official school newspaper. The paper is entirely student-run, although it is faculty-advised. Although the paper focuses on school events and news, it also includes local news and information regarding fund-raising events. The Arlingtonian publishes bi-monthly while school is in session. The newspaper is distributed free to all students, as well as local stores. A home delivery option is also available.\n\nArlington offers senior students the option to fulfill their high-school graduation requirements while simultaneously completing a full year of college at Marist College in Poughkeepsie. The program permits the student to earn up to 15 credits while fulfilling the basic Regents Prep courses in history and mathematics\n\nSenior Follies is an Arlington High School Tradition that dates back to the 1970s. It is a comedy and music show featuring members of the graduating class hosted by Senior Class Student Government. In 2011, the long-standing tradition resurfaced for the first time in six years.\n\nThe original building constructed specifically to house Arlington High School was built on Raymond Avenue in Poughkeepsie. It later went on to be used as the Arthur S. May Elementary School, and most recently (2014) it was purchased by nearby Vassar College. The second high school was built in 1933 and went on to become the Arlington Middle School. That building is now the current location of the Arthur S. May Elementary School, which moved into the building in 2014. The current Arlington High School building, originally constructed in 1961, has been significantly expanded several times, most recently in 2009. The newly expanded high school includes a main lobby, where the \"Bubble\" is located. Adjacent to the main lobby are the main office, the \"Main Annex\" and a New York State Police office. Attached to this are two long hallways running in opposite directions, which house more offices and classrooms. At the end of one of the hallways are the Gyms (Gyms 5, 6, 7), as well as the Athletic Department office. At the end of the other hallway, on the opposite end of the school, is the Large Group Instruction Room, Cafeterias C and D, and the Admiral Cafe, a student-run restaurant that operates during school hours. The original facility was built on a site by UW Marx to support a maximum of 4,000 students. The school has a net building area of and a cost of $64,229,000.\n\nThe current Arlington High School campus was first constructed in 1961, when the former high school, a 1930s-era WPA building in the Arlington area of Poughkeepsie, was converted into a middle school. In 1967, the first of several renovations took place, adding dozens of new classrooms to the building and raising building capacity to 1,500 students. In 1979, the current high school became \"North Campus\" for juniors, seniors and a portion of the sophomore class, while the former LaGrange Junior High School, located a short distance away on Stringham Road in Lagrangeville, was re-designated \"South Campus\" and housed freshman and the rest of the sophomore class. Some sophomore students split their days between the two campuses, and school buses came in both a \"first wave\" and a \"second wave\" to serve both campuses. Another renovation was completed at the high school in the Autumn of 1998 that nearly tripled its size, enabling all four grades to be moved back to what had been the North Campus. With the reconsolidation of the high school onto one campus, the Stringham Road building became LaGrange Middle School.\n\nBecause the 1998 expansion was meant to address the district's requirements for only 10 years, discussion began in 2005 on an additional, large expansion of the building. Debate over the expansion was tense, due to the perception of already lofty school-tax rates and the looming energy crisis. Nevertheless, district voters approved the measure, though with several budget-trimming alterations. As a result, the school expanded again, with the new renovation completed by 2009. It is large enough to hold more than 4,000 students.\n\nIn 2006, voters in the district approved a plan to expand the campus further. The expansion includes 40 new classrooms, a K-12 education center, a new TV studio, a radio station as well as new science labs, a new auditorium, and a cafeteria for seniors. The expansion was added onto the school's south end of the 1100s and encompasses the previous senior parking lot. New parking lots on the east side of the building will offset the loss of parking arising from the expansion. As of December 2010, the old music office has been transformed into a senior lounge, although rather bare. The William J. Sweeney Performance Hall has opened and was first used for the Admiral Players' production \"The Wedding Singer\" and the 2010 Winter Concert Series.\n\nIn 2006, the school began \"The House Plan\". The plan gave each grade its own office, with four guidance counselors, two administrators and advisers. The 11th Grade house is located near the Main Annex, the 12th Grade house is located near the South Satellite 9th Grade house is located in the West Satellite and the 10th Grade house is located in the East House Guidance. (This is as of 2019–2020; the houses rotate each year). In these houses, there are many contests, parties, and small social functions.\n\nArlington High School competes in Section 1 of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association.\n\n"}

It relocated struggling urban and rural families to communities planned by the federal government. On September 1, 1937, it was succeeded by the Farm Security Administration.\n\nThe RA was the brainchild of Rexford G. Tugwell, an economics professor at Columbia University who became an advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt during the latter's unsuccessful campaign for the presidency in 1932 and then held positions in the United States Department of Agriculture. Roosevelt established the RA under Executive Order 7027, as one of the New Deal's \"alphabet agencies\", and Tugwell became its first and only head. \n\nThe new organization had four divisions: Rural Rehabilitation, Rural Resettlement, Land Utilization, and Suburban Resettlement. Roosevelt transferred the Federal Emergency Relief Administration land program to the Resettlement Administration under Executive Order 7028 on May 1, 1935.\n\nHowever, Tugwell's goal of moving 650,000 people from of agriculturally exhausted, worn-out land was unpopular among the majority in Congress. This goal seemed socialistic to some and threatened to deprive influential farm owners of their tenant workforce. The RA was thus left with enough resources to relocate only a few thousand people from and build several greenbelt cities, which planners admired as models for a cooperative future that never arrived.\n\nThe main focus of the RA was to now build relief camps in California for migratory workers, especially refugees from the drought-struck Dust Bowl of the Southwest. This move was resisted by a large share of Californians, who did not want destitute migrants to settle in their midst. \n\nThe RA managed to construct 95 camps that gave migrants unaccustomed clean quarters with running water and other amenities, but the 75,000 people who had the benefit of the camps were a small share of those in need and even they could stay only temporarily. After facing enormous criticism for his poor management of the RA, Tugwell resigned in 1936. On January 1, 1937, with hopes of making the RA more effective, the Resettlement Administration was transferred to the Department of Agriculture through executive order 7530. \n\nThe Weedpatch Camp (also known as the Arvin Federal Government Camp and the Sunset Labor Camp) now on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1936 south of Bakersfield, California, not by the RA but the Works Progress Administration. The camp inspired John Steinbeck's 1939 novel, \"The Grapes of Wrath\", a 1940 film adaptation directed by John Ford, a Tony Award-winning play and an opera.\n\nIn the face of Congressional criticism, in September 1937 it was folded into a new body, the Farm Security Administration (FSA), which operated until 1946.\n\nThe RA worked with nearly 200 communities on its projects, notably including:\n\nThe RA also funded projects recording aspects of its work and context, including:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their final album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Christian and No. 2 on the Billboard 200 charts. They disbanded in 2012, with David Crowder pursuing a solo career under the name Crowder and the rest of the band, except for Mike Hogan, forming The Digital Age.\n\nPrior to the album \"Church Music\", the band preferred not to be referred to as \"\"The\" David Crowder*Band\". They explained that they preferred to omit the article, and stated that they \"may revisit this issue if other groups named 'David Crowder*Band' begin performing,\" and may in fact, should that eventuality occur, insert \"The Original\" in front of the band's present appellation. As of the release of \"Church Music\", however, the band has begun referring to themselves using the article, and explained \"we’ve been at for a while now without incident, so we felt justified in its formal inclusion.\"\n\nThe band's name is usually rendered with an asterisk, as \"David Crowder*Band\". In a faux-documentary, while recording \"Church Music\", Crowder joked that the asterisk meant, \"David Crowder [is about to go insane because Jack Parker continually tries to sabotage the work of the rest of the] band.\"\n\nThe band began when Crowder realized that almost half of the students at Baylor University, a Christian university, were not attending church. Finding this very surprising he and Chris Seay started University Baptist Church (Waco, Texas) in 1995, while he was still a student. Crowder became pastor of worship at the church and led worship and continued to do so throughout the year. The church's congregation grew, as did the band's lineup.\n\nCrowder began writing songs to incorporate into the worship times at the church and eventually the church released an independent CD, \"Pour Over Me\", followed by \"All I Can Say\" in 1999. These CDs brought the band to a wider audience and invitations to festivals and events followed. The band was signed to sixstepsrecords/Sparrow Records when Louie Giglio talked to Crowder about the music and how it could be used more than just at UBC and more worldwide. Although the band toured extensively, they made it a point to be back at their home church UBC in Waco Texas for most Sundays.\n\nKyle Lake, University Baptist Church's former pastor and also longtime friend of the band, had a strong influence on the band's music in terms of content and inspiration both during his life and after Lake's death.\n\nWith their September 2005 release, \"A Collision or (3+4=7)\", David Crowder Band explored a new realm of musical diversity. The album houses a mix of bluegrass, folk, alternative, and worship, woven together with a touch of electronic ambience. This release landed them the No. 2 spot on the iTunes Music Store and the No. 39 spot on \"Billboard\" 200 the second day after its release. The same day as the release of \"A Collision\", their song \"Turkish Delight\" was released on the \"\" compilation CD. This song, which is a reference to the magical Turkish Delight in C. S. Lewis's book \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", has an old-school disco feel.\n\nMarch 19, 2007, the band officially started recording \"Remedy\"; the band also revealed the album's website, which allowed fans to follow the band via live webcams, and discover more about the album. Ted Nugent made a guest appearance on the album, on the song \"We Won't Be Quiet\". \"Remedy\" was released on September 25, 2007. The day after its release, it reached No. 4 on the iTunes Music Store. When Mark Waldrop joined the band as the album \"Remedy\" was released, his sidekick Rupert came with him. Rupert is a gnome. During the Remedy Tour the band had up a live web feed on Crowder's Xanga account. The feed had a chat room where fans chatted live with the band and their tourmates. It showed more than half of the tour stops live which included their tour bus, live stage feeds of shows, places the band went, etc. Much of the time the video feed would be on Rupert at different stops. On the final night of the tour Phil Wickham and The Myriad came on stage for a hoe down for the song \"I Saw the light\". The camera for the feed was on the lid of a ball-cap and was wired into a laptop the band had in a backpack; this equipment was provided by Xanga. The band also used the feed for some time after their Remedy Tour.\nJuly 16, 2008, the band announced it would be releasing a live album and DVD titled \"Remedy Club Tour - Live\", The DVD was filmed In NYC and GA.\n\nCrowder's Xanga entry from January 31, 2009, mentioned the preproduction of the band's next studio album. Also on Mike Hogan's MySpace entry from March 4, 2009, he confirmed that actual recording and production had commenced and provided directions for getting to the live webcam feed, which is in a page simply titled \"Church Music\". The album was titled \"Church Music\" and was released on September 22, 2009. The first single off the album was a cover of John Mark McMillan's song \"How He Loves\". Crowder received permission from McMillan to change the words \"So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss\" to \"So heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss\".\n\nThe band hosted Crowder's Fantastical Church Music Conference September 30 through October 2, 2010 at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. Other presenters at the conference included Louie Giglio, Rob Bell, Israel Houghton, Hillsong London, Matt Redman, Jars of Clay, Matt Maher, Leeland, David Dark, Gungor, Derek Webb, and Isaac Wardell. Mark recorded a Rap song for the band titled \"Bwack Be Creepin'\" for the band's YouTube channel.\n\nFebruary 5, 2011 the band announced the official start to recording of \"Give Us Rest or (A Requiem Mass in C [The Happiest of All Keys])\". On May 21, 2011, the band announced through their website that the band will end after the completion of the Fall 2011 \"The 7 Tour\" and the release of their sixth album.\n\nLater, on July 21, 2011, the band announced that a Christmas album, \"Oh for Joy\", would be released on October 4, 2011. The band stated that they began to record \"Give Us Rest\" and subsequently \"Oh for Joy\" came out. Some of the songs in the albums \"Give Us Rest\" and \"Oh for Joy\" were recorded in greenrooms and restrooms during the band's last tour.\n\nThe band played their final show at the Passion 2012 Conference on January 3, 2012 at the Georgia Dome.\n\nCrowder has formed a new collective called \"Crowder\" that made its first performance at the Creation East Festival in June 2012. Parker, Dodson, Bush, and Waldrop have formed a new band, called \"The Digital Age\", and run a recording studio in Waco, Texas. David Crowder is still signed with Sparrow Records and sixstepsrecords under Capitol CMG. He is now making music under the name \"Crowder.\"\n\nThe band often incorporated unconventional instruments and elements into their music, many of which were created by the band's drummer Jeremy Bush. He modified a Speak & Spell for the song \"I Can Hear the Angels Singing (...Andeverandeverand...)\", and used a robot drummer, named Steve 3PO, for use in \"Church Music\", a silver box with blue lights and switches for \"Can You Feel It?\", and a MOTM modular synthesizer used by Hogan. He also manufactured a seven square-foot MPC style-MIDI controller for the band Family Force 5. \n\nA guitar-shaped controller from the Guitar Hero game was used in \"... neverending ...\". According to Crowder, the controller was transformed to a MIDI instrument. Jeremy \"B-Wack\" Bush programmed the controller such that each of the buttons were put into USB Overdrive, an application for reading signals off of USB devices. The buttons were programmed to each specific chord in the song \"...neverending...\". Once the buttons were programmed and sent to USB Overdrive, the results were put in to Ableton Live as a MIDI note programmed by the band. There were 12 samples in the controller. \n\nHogan often played turntables and played electric violin with guitar effects. A Smule \"I Am T-Pain\" iPhone app is used on \"The Nearness\". On incorporating bluegrass into the band's repertoire, Crowder stated that the banjo was something he had previously wanted to avoid \"at all costs\".\n\nThe band often recorded their albums in a barn behind Crowder's house.\n\n\n\nDavid Crowder*Band is also featured in other compilation albums that were either nominated or won Dove Awards for Special Event Album of the Year:\n\nThe band was named MSN's Artist of the Month for July 2006, and later won Artist of the Year for 2006.\n\n"}
{"id": "2241675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241675", "title": "Secobarbital", "text": "Secobarbital\n\nSecobarbital sodium (marketed by Eli Lilly and Company for the treatment of insomnia, and subsequently by other companies as described below, under the brand name Seconal) is a short-acting barbiturate derivative drug that was patented in 1934 in the United States. It possesses anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotic properties. In the United Kingdom, it was known as quinalbarbitone. It is the most frequently used drug in physician-assisted suicide within the United States. Secobarbital is considered to be an obsolete sedative-hypnotic (sleeping pill), and as a result, it has largely been replaced by the benzodiazepine family. Seconal was widely abused, known on the streets as \"red devils\" or \"reds\".\n\nSecobarbital is indicated for:\n\nRanbaxy Pharmaceuticals, an India-based company now predominantly owned by the Japanese company Daiichi Sankyo, obtained the rights to market and to use the trade name Seconal from Eli Lilly in 1998 and did so until September 18, 2008. The actual manufacturer of Seconal subsequent to the time Eli Lilly manufactured the drug was Ohm Pharmaceuticals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ranbaxy. The rights to market Seconal were then sold to Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which became the marketer and trade-name holder. At the time Marathon Pharmaceuticals obtained ownership of the brand name, the retail price for one 100 mg. capsule (depending upon prescription size and pharmacy) averaged about one U.S. dollar. During the time Marathon owned the brand name, the Company greatly increased the price of the drug. By February 2015, when Marathon sold the rights to Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the average retail price per 100 mg. capsule had risen to over thirty dollars. Since its acquisition of the trade name, Valeant Pharmaceuticals made little, if any, change to the pricing of Seconal. Despite the price increases implemented by Marathon Pharmaceuticals, Seconal was still manufactured by Ohm. In the United States, Seconal is available only in 100 mg capsules, as a sodium salt. The salt is a white hygroscopic powder that is soluble in water and ethanol.\n\nWhile generic versions of the drug were in existence after Eli Lilly's patent of the name Seconal expired, currently there are no companies that manufacture the drug generically in the United States. Valeant is now the sole marketer of Seconal in the United States.\n\nThe sodium salt of secobarbital is classified separately from the free acid, as follows:\n\nPossible side effects of secobarbital include:\n\nSecobarbital may produce psychological addiction and produces physical dependence if used for an extended period of time. Withdrawal symptoms may occur if long-term use is abruptly ended and can include:\n\n\nSecobarbital was widely abused for recreational purposes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and accidental overdose was associated with the drug. Lilly's Seconal came in a bright orange/red bullet shaped capsule known as a Pulvule. Prescription use of secobarbital decreased beginning in the early 1980s by which time benzodiazepines had become increasingly common. Secobarbital has acquired many nicknames, the most common being \"reds,\" \"red devils,\" or \"red dillies\" (because of the color of the capsules). Other common nicknames are \"seccies,\" \"Cardinals,\" \"ruby slippers,\" and, according to the Wegman's School of Pharmacy curriculum, \"red hearts\". A less common nickname is \"dolls\"; this was partly responsible for the title of Jacqueline Susann's novel \"Valley of the Dolls\", whose main characters use secobarbital and other such drugs. Actress Carole Landis and journalist Dorothy Kilgallen both allegedly committed suicide or accidentally overdosed on secobarbital in 1948 and 1965 respectively.\n\nIn the Netherlands, individuals have two options for euthanasia. They can orally consume 100 ml of concentrated syrup containing either 15 grams of pentobarbital or 15 grams of secobarbital, or they can choose to have 2 grams of thiopental or 1 gram of propofol administered intravenously by a doctor, followed by a muscle relaxant. In recent years only 15% of those who died by euthanasia opted for orally consuming the lethal drug(s), the rest choosing to have the drugs administered intravenously by a doctor instead.\n\nIn the United States, secobarbital and pentobarbital are the most common drugs prescribed under physician aid-in-dying laws in Oregon since 1998, Washington since 2008, and Vermont since 2013. Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited previously experienced various issues in their attempts to produce 100 mg secobarbital capsules. \n\nIn 2017, secobarbital was made available for physician-assisted suicide in Canada. \n\nIt is a component in the veterinary drug Somulose, used for euthanasia of horses and cattle.\n\nThe of secobarbital has been reported to be between 125 mg/kg (rat, oral) and 267 mg/kg (mouse, oral).\n\n\n"}

Employees are specially trained and certified at the Genius Bar. Their role is to help customers with Apple hardware and software. All in-store repairs of Apple products are carried out by \"Geniuses\", formerly known as Mac Geniuses. In September 2009, the Family Room Specialists were folded into the mix to handle iPod and iPhone troubleshooting. After its release in 2010, iPad appointments also fell under the Family Room Specialists. Apple now maintains two Genius Bar queues: Mac and Mobile Device.\n\nThe Genius Bar was referenced in a short-lived 2012 television advertising campaign with an actor portraying a Genius Bar employee who helped Apple customers in everyday situations. The ads were generally poorly received and were subsequently withdrawn.\n\nThe layout of a Genius Bar previously consisted of at least two 15\" MacBook Pro computers, often mounted on \"floating\" stands. Employees now use iPads with similar software to check in machines for repairs. There may be other \"floating\" notebooks for iPod/iPhone troubleshooting, often referred to as \"floaters\". LCD screens behind the Bar play looped videos which offer tips to customers waiting for help. Stools can be found in front of the Bar for people to sit and chat with each other or with employees.\n\nThe \"Red Telephone\" sometimes seen behind the Genius Bar was a direct line to Apple product specialists, allowing for problems and questions too complicated for the in-store employees to answer. As of August 2009, this phone is no longer installed in newer Apple Retail Stores and removed in others.\n\nThe employees can also be viewed as the local representatives of AppleCare. They offer personal support when customers have problems or questions relating to their Apple products. Most services carried out at the Genius Bar are free. Non-warranty service (which is paid for by the customer when repairs are complete) is also routinely performed. In some countries, Apple has service depots where portable repairs (for issues such as accidental damage) can be completed for a flat rate. Most portable computer repairs and all desktop repairs are performed in-store and completed overnight or within a few days.\n\nLarger support teams are headed up by the \"Lead Genius\", who schedules workers, and handles customer service issues at the Genius Bar. The Lead Genius is assisted by the \"Genius Admin\", who is in charge of managing the administrative paperwork, organizing the Geniuses' work and liaising with customers about their repairs.\n\nTrainees (referred to as \"GYO\", or Grow-Your-Own Geniuses) are not certified, but trained for iPod and iPhone issues, and help out where needed before going to formal training and certification at one of several training locations worldwide, including Cupertino, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Sydney, Australia; London, England and Ireland.\n\nThe Genius Training Student Workbook is Apple's employee training manual for Apple Store tech-support employees, called Geniuses. The manual features various marketing techniques revolving around the end goal of selling merchandise. One of the basic tenets taught to the employees in training is that “Everyone in the Apple Store is in the business of selling”.\n\nThe basic selling strategy is summed up with a mnemonic device: Approach, Probe, Present, Listen, End (APPLE). \nWhen customers have concerns, the prescribed response in the manual is the \"Three Fs:\" Feel, Felt, and Found technique.\nAlthough employees who are not in the Genius role don't receive this manual or go through this training, every Genius must attend a two-week recruit training that mandates programs as diverse as “Using Diagnostic Services” and “The Power of Empathy.”\nGeniuses also have a list of words that the manual clearly stipulates as banned; words such as \"bomb\", \"crash\" and \"hang\" must be substituted by \"does not respond\" or \"unexpectedly quits\". The manual also teaches employees to read emotional cues such as drumming on a table or placing a palm on the back of the neck that might mean a customer is bored or frustrated, respectively.\n\nThe manual was a well-kept secret, until a copy leaked in August 2012 and ended in the hands of Gizmodo's senior staff writer Sam Biddle, who commented: \"It’s a penetrating look inside Apple: psychological mastery, banned words, roleplaying—you’ve never seen anything like it.\" A \"Christian Science Monitor\" article connected the manual's contents to the idea of the \"reality distortion field\", a term for Apple's effectiveness at charming customers.\n\nCurrently, Apple offers the Genius Bar for technical support, and has Creatives — software trainers — available at all times to answer less technical questions. \n\nOver the years, Apple has experimented with ways of offering service and support to complement the Genius Bar. Some examples, all now defunct, include:\n\n\nPro Labs and Open Lab were introduced with the opening of the Apple Store on West 14th Street in New York City, New York while Pro Labs is also offered at the Sydney, Australia Apple Store and the Pudong, China Apple Store. Open Lab to date is only offered at the West 14th Street location.\n\nApple has also branded features in their iTunes application \"Genius\" that make musical suggestions based on the user's observed taste.\n\n"}

The youngest daughter of prominent surgeon Robert Sattler, Alexina was nicknamed \"Teeny\" by her mother Agnes Mitchell because of her low birth weight.\n\nSattler at first thought of becoming an artist and went to Paris in 1921, where for a time she studied sculpture with Constantin Brâncuși at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris. She first met Marcel Duchamp in 1923 at a ball given in her honor by American sculptor Mariette Benedict Mills, the mother of a close friend. In 1929 Teeny married Pierre Matisse, an art dealer and the youngest son of Fauve artist Henri Matisse. They had three children: Jacqueline, Paul, and Peter. Throughout 1938, Henri Matisse made a series of portrait sketches of Alexina. When her husband was mobilized in Paris at the outbreak of World War II, she ran his gallery for some months. In 1949 Pierre and Teeny separated due to Pierre's infidelity with Patricia Kane Matta, the former wife of surrealist painter Roberto Matta. She received in the subsequent divorce settlement many important paintings.\n\nShe worked for a time as an agent and broker for artists such as Brâncuși and Joan Miró.\n\nIn the autumn of 1951 she was invited by Dorothea Tanning to go on a weekend trip in Hunterdon County. It was on that trip that she once again met Duchamp, and romance developed shortly thereafter. They were both avid chess players. Teeny and Duchamp married in New York City on January 16, 1954. They lived in New York and in Paris; around 1958, the couple began spending summers in Cadaqués, Spain, on the Costa Brava. They were together until his death in 1968. Following Duchamp's death, Alexina moved to Villiers-sous-Grez, near Paris, where she assembled an archive of photographs and other material documenting the life and work of her late husband. She maintained a close friendship with many of Duchamp's friends, including Jasper Johns, Richard Hamilton, composer John Cage, Gianfranco Baruchello, and choreographer Merce Cunningham. Alexander Calder presented her with individually designed jewelry. She also served as an honorary trustee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which has the largest collection of Duchamp's work.\n\n\n"}

In 1907, he swept the major two-year-old stakes races including the Belmont Futurity and Champagne Stakes and was the consensus Horse of the Year. His three-year-old campaign was cut short by injury but he was still Horse of the Year based on his three wins including the Belmont Stakes. As a sire, he suffered from fertility problems but still sired multiple stakes winners.\n\nColin was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1956. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century, he was ranked number 15.\n\nColin was a brown stallion with three white socks and a stripe and snip on his face. He was foaled in 1905 at Castleton Stud in Kentucky and was owned by London-born financier James R. Keene. Colin was from the third crop of foals by the stakes winner and leading sire Commando (by Domino), who had been bred by James Keene. Colin's dam was the English stakes-winning Pastorella (GB), by Springfield.\n\nColin was trained by Hall of Fame inductee James G. Rowe, Sr. Rowe had handled many top horses in his long career, including Sysonby, Hindoo (who was never unplaced), and the first filly to win the Kentucky Derby, Regret. Rowe and his horses Miss Woodford, Luke Blackburn, Whisk Broom II, Commando, and Peter Pan were inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nJames Keene was not initially enthusiastic about Colin, noting his disfiguring curb, or thoroughpin, meaning that the colt had an enlarged hock. He'd been just as disdainful of an earlier purchase: Colin's grandsire Domino, (another eventual Horse of the Year in 1893 and Hall of Famer), but his son, Foxwell Keene, bought Domino anyway.\n\nA friend of Keene's, De Courcey Forbes, always named the Castleton foals. Colin was for \"Poor Colin\", a pastoral poem by the English poet laureate Nicholas Rowe, thus connecting the name of Colin's dam and the name of his trainer, who took a keen interest in his horses. A hands-on trainer, Rowe was famous for the personal attention he paid to his horses. He literally traveled in the same railroad car with them. Aware that Colin's swollen hock would give him trouble, Rowe attended to it with massages and cold water baths.\n\nConsistently rated as one of the best horses in American racing history, and a celebrity with both fans and horsemen, Colin started fifteen times in his two-year career and never lost. Twelve of these races came when he was a two-year-old. In an age that valued stamina and maturity, Colin was still viewed with awe by the horsemen of his time. Sportswriter Abram Hewitt said, \"The blood surges, and the pulses quicken at the very sight of such Olympians on the track.\" Hewitt had \"listened to old-time horsemen talk about Colin with an other-world expression on their faces.\" Colin was voted the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year twice: in 1907 and 1908. He was also America's Champion Three-Year-Old Male in 1908.\n\nColin's last victory came on June 20, 1908 in the Tidal Stakes at Sheepshead Bay, after which he was sent to England to race, but was pulled up lame in a workout and was retired.\n\nColin stood his first season in 1909 at Heath Stud, near Newmarket, England, for a fee of 98 guineas. He was neglected by the English breeders due to his American bloodlines. First in England, and then back in Kentucky after Keene died, Colin was plagued by infertility problems. In c. 1913, Colin was purchased for $30,000 by Wickliffe Stud, where he stood until the stud was dispersed in January 1918. Edward B. McLean then purchased the 13-year-old Colin for $5,100 to stand at his Belray Farm, near Middleburg, Virginia. He sired 11 stakes winners out of 81 foals in 23 seasons at stud, which translates into 14% of his get. His best galloper was Jock (1924 from Kathleen by *Sempronius; 17 wins and $95,255). His son Neddie was the paternal grandsire of Alsab. Another was On Watch, the broodmare sire Stymie.\n\nColin died in 1932 at the age of twenty-seven on Belray Farm near Middleburg, Virginia. His lifetime earnings amounted to $180,912.\n\nKent Hollingsworth admired Colin's career as a racehorse and observed the horses' potential in his book, \"The Great Ones\". He said, \"Great horses have been beaten by mischance, racing luck, injury and lesser horses running the race of their lives. None of these, however, took Colin. He was unbeatable.”\n\nColin was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1956. In \"The Blood-Horse magazine\" ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, he was ranked #15. It was eighty years before another horse, Personal Ensign, retired unbeaten in America.\n\n\n\n"}

The group's sound became increasingly infused with hardcore punk when Phil Hines, of Flint hardcore punk band Dissonance, joined as a drummer. They juggled band names, first renaming themselves Ultraviolence and then Genocide before recording their first demo in 1984. In spite of their growing popularity in the underground Genocide struggled to survive and faced difficulty maintaining a consistent lineup.\n\nIn the summer of 1985 Chuck Schuldiner, of pioneering death metal act Death, invited Carlson and Olivo to Florida to complete the Death lineup. The two parties failed to settle on a uniform creative direction and the merger proved short lived. Carlson and Olivo returned to Flint that summer, determined to reform Genocide. Local punk Dave 'Grave' Hollingshead was recruited as drummer, after Carlson and Olivo saw an article about Hollingshead being arrested for grave robbery.\n\nIn 1985 the reformed Genocide recorded the \"Violent Death\" demo tape, with Carlson assuming bass duties, and resumed playing live locally. In late 1985 Aaron Freeman was invited into the band as a second guitarist. With their line-up fleshed out, Genocide recorded in a studio for the first time to lay down the tracks for what was supposed to be their first album \"The Stench of Burning Death\" – it ended up being their third demo. By 1986 Repulsion's trademark style had matured; characterised by raspy shouted vocals, extremely distorted down-tuned guitars, overdriven punkish riffs, absurd rambling solos interjected as if only as an afterthought, rumbling bass lines, and machine-gun drumming. Repulsion was experimenting with a hammering, static clouded, lo-fi sound that was on a level of extreme that had been touched on by few bands before. To complement the band's sound they penned gruesome lyrics; focusing on fantastic apocalyptic themes ranging from zombie epidemics to nuclear war.\n\nFinally in 1989 Repulsion's material enjoyed modest, albeit posthumous, exposure when UK grindcore pioneers Carcass distributed a Repulsion compilation titled \"Horrified\" on their own Necrosis Records label; a subsidiary of Earache Records. With interest in Repulsion rekindled, the band decided to reform in 1990. They resumed playing live with the (almost) 'classic' Repulsion lineup: Scott Carlson bass and vocals, Aaron Freeman on guitar, and Dave Grave on drums; Matt Olivo, then serving in the army, filled in as a second guitarist when possible. Repulsion recorded two self-financed demos in 1991: \"Rebirth\", and their \"Final Demo\", often criticised as lacking the drive and intensity of the band's earlier material. Later that year they managed to release a single on Relapse entitled \"Excruciation\". In spite of new material the band broke up yet again in 1993. Scott Carlson went on to play in Cathedral briefly, the rest of the band departed for short-lived projects or simply returned to everyday life. Relapse re-released \"Horrified\" again in 2003, drawing attention to Repulsion once more, and prompting the band to resume live performance. In 2004 Repulsion also released a live DVD.\n\nIn 2008, Repulsion opened for At the Gates on their \"Suicidal Final Tour\" in California, along with Darkest Hour and Municipal Waste.\n\nVenom, Hellhammer, Slayer, Slaughter, and Discharge have been repeatedly cited in interviews as major influences. Various bands have recorded covers of Repulsion songs, including Napalm Death, Impaled and Entombed.\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After the division of the Duchy of Normandy in 1204, the strategic location of the harbour led to the construction of the castle of Mont Orgueil to protect the island against the French, also serving as residence for Governors of Jersey until the late 16th century when Elizabeth Castle was constructed off Saint Helier.\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that the Harbour Master's house would be sold, and the proceeds used to carry out restoration work to Gorey Pier. In the same year, plans were submitted for 52 homes on the Jersey Pottery site.\n\nThe pier below the castle has been the site of the annual \"Fête de la Mer\" (seafood gastronomic festival) until 2010, and also contains an interpretation centre exhibiting the history and environment of the area. The annual Gorey Fête in August is one of the largest such events in Jersey.\n\nThere are a number of hotels, shops, restaurants, and bars.

{"id": "2241748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241748", "title": "Morris C8", "text": "Morris C8\n\nThe Morris Commercial C8 FAT (Field Artillery Tractor), commonly known as a \"Quad\", is an artillery tractor used by the British and Commonwealth (including Canadian Army) forces during the Second World War.\nIt was used to tow field artillery pieces, such as the 25-pounder gun-howitzer, and anti-tank guns, such as the 17-pounder.\n\nAlthough its sloped sides suggest otherwise, the Quad was not armoured.\n\nIn 1937 the War Department identified a need for a new FAT to supplement, and then replace, the Light Dragon and Morris CDSWs then in service. A specification was issued for a four-wheeled, four-wheel drive vehicle, with winch, on a short chassis. Guy Motors produced their design quite quickly using existing components, and Morris followed with theirs. It was a totally new, but conventional, design evolved from the CS8.\n\nIt included a new four-cylinder engine mounted on a subframe and not directly onto the chassis. Like the Guy, the body had a very characteristic slope sided, \"beetle back\" shape. It was all-metal and designed to facilitate chemical weapon decontamination, as well as to enable a gun traversing platform to be carried on the rear roof section. In addition to 6 men, it was capable of carrying 24 complete boxed rounds of 25-pounder ammunition and at least 8 boxed anti-tank shells, together with vehicle and gun detachment equipment.\n\nThe first Morris C8 Quad was delivered in October 1939 and it then stayed in production until 1945. There were two major changes to the mechanical side of the vehicle, and two independent ones to the body. The engine/chassis design was used on other Morris types, such as the C8 Morris 15 cwt truck. A long-wheelbase version was used to produce the C9B self-propelled Bofors Light Anti-Aircraft Tractor.\n\nAs an FAT the Quad served with Field Artillery Regiments. Each regiment had 36 Quads; 24 towed a limber and gun, and 12 towed two limbers.\n\nIt was first issued in late 1939 and first used in action in France in 1940, towing 18-pounder, 18/25-pounder and 4.5-inch howitzers. Many were lost in the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from France and as a result some of these were taken into service by the Wehrmacht.\n\nFrom June 1940 it was also used to tow 75 mm guns provided by the USA; these were towed both with and without limbers. It was subsequently used wherever the FA Regts went, from Iceland to Malaya, primarily as a tractor for the, then new, 25-pounder gun. It was also used by most of the Commonwealth and Allied units equipped with the 25-pounder.\n\nIt was a popular vehicle although really too small for all the equipment that was carried. It was also underpowered when towing and loaded. Moving 9 tons with a 70 bhp engine was not ideal, and its speed uphill was unspectacular. Considerable use had to be made of the winch on hills and in mud.\nLater in the war, when the anti-tank regiments were equipped with 6-pounder and 17-pounder guns, Quads were issued as tractors. Normally these guns were towed without a limber but some 17-pounders were towed with limbers. This can only have been for the aid of the limber's brake, and a smoother tow, as the ammunition would not fit in a limber.\n\nAt the end of the War the Quad stayed in British service in the same roles. It saw extensive action in the Korean War and Malaya.\n\nMany of the Commonwealth and Allied forces took their Quads to their home countries, and were provided with more ex-British ones to fully re-equip. The Royal Netherlands Army subsequently made extensive use of theirs in the East Indies.\n\nThe British rebuilt many of their Quads in the early 1950s, extending their useful life until 1959 when the last was sold off. They were replaced by three-ton tractors, derived from the Bedford RL and Fordson Thames E4.\n\nMark I\n\nMark II\n\nMark III\n\nThree types of body were used:\n\n\nOnce the 18-pounder and 18/25-pounder had left service there was no requirement to carry the gun's traversing platform on the roof. The brackets for this were duly removed, and usually substituted by a framework to provide an additional area for the storage of kit.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "2241767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241767", "title": "John Mason (c. 1600–1672)", "text": "John Mason (c. 1600–1672)\n\nJohn Mason (October, 1600 – January 30, 1672), was an early English settler, soldier, commander, and Deputy Governor of the Connecticut Colony. Mason was best known for leading the English settlers at an attack on the Pequot and the Mystic Fort, an event that ended up being known as the Mystic Massacre which effectively ended the hegemony of the Pequot tribe in southeast Connecticut.\n\nMason was born in Ravensthorpe, Northamptonshire, England. John Mason's baptism is recorded in the St. Deny's church records on October 5, 1600 and lists his father as Richard Mason, who was married on May 23, 1600 in Ravensthorpe to Alis Burlyn - Burlyn is probably an error for Butlyn because Alis Butlyn was baptized in Ravensthorpe on September 9. 1576. Alis could be the phonetic version of Alice.\n\nLittle is known about his youth and life there. Mason was well educated, but it is not known where he was schooled in England or perhaps a military school in the Netherlands. He enlisted in the military in 1624 and then went to the Netherlands to serve in the sectarian Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), where he gained significant tactical military experience, first seeing action in the Breda Campaign. His activities from the earliest days in New England give evidence of training as a military engineer. His prose is vigorous and direct in his regular correspondence with the Winthrop Family and in his history of the Pequot War.\n\nBy 1629 he was a lieutenant in the Brabant Campaign and participated in the Siege of s'-Hertogenbosch, literally \"The Duke's Forrest\" in English, and known historically in French as Bois-le-Duc. He served with Lord Thomas Fairfax under General Sir Horace Vere in the army of Frederik Hendrik, The Prince of Orange.\n\nIn 1632, he joined the great Puritan exodus and sailed from England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, settling in Dorchester where he was promptly appointed as the captain of the local militia. In 1633, he commanded the first American naval task force and pursued the pirate Dixie Bull, routing him from New England waters. He and Roger Ludlow planned and supervised the construction of the first fortifications on Castle Island (later known as Fort Independence) in Boston Harbor. In 1634, he was elected to represent Dorchester in the Massachusetts General Court, where permission was granted for him to remove to the fertile Connecticut River valley. In 1635, he settled in Windsor, Connecticut at the confluence of the Farmington River and the Connecticut River; he lived there for the next twelve years and served as a civil Magistrate and military leader of the nascent Connecticut Colony. In 1640, he married Anne Peck from a prominent Puritan family; they had eight children.\n\nThe Pequot War started in the predawn hours of May 26, 1637 when English forces led by Captains John Mason and John Underhill, along with their Indian allies, attacked one of two main fortified Pequot villages at Mystic. Only 20 soldiers breached the palisade's gate and were quickly overwhelmed, to the point that they utilized fire to create chaos and facilitate their escape from within. Sergeant William Hayden of Windsor is credited with saving the life of Captain Mason inside the fort, using his sword to cut through the bow-string of one of the Pequot warriors aiming his weapon at Mason. The ensuing conflagration trapped the majority of the Pequots and caused their death; those who managed to exit were slain by the sword or musket from the others who surrounded the fort. Only a handful of approximately 500 men, women, and children survived what became known as the Battle of Mistick Fort.\n\nAs the soldiers made the exhausted withdrawal march to their boats, they faced several attacks by frantic warriors from the other village of Weinshauks, but again the Pequots suffered very heavy losses versus relatively few by the Colonists. These two defeats broke the resources and spirit of the tribe, who then decided to retreat west to the Hudson River area. They were pursued along the southern coast, with other confrontations at Sachem's Head and the Fairfield swamp, suffering more deaths and capture. Sassacus and his core band did make it to New York, but Sassacus was killed there by the Mohawks; they cut off his hands and head and delivered them to the Massachusetts Bay Colony without explanation for their actions.\nMason recounted his experiences in the Pequot War in his narrative \"Major Mason's Brief History of the Pequot War\", which was originally printed in 1677 by Increase Mather and later reprinted by Thomas Prince in 1736.\n\nThe most prominent episode in Mason's lifelong career of public service was his overall command as captain of the Colonial forces in the Pequot War in 1637. This was the first declared and sustained conflict in Southern New England, a complex and risky campaign. The large and powerful Pequot Tribe had subjugated other local tribes, killed numerous Colonial settlers and destroyed vital corn crops. The Massachusetts Bay Colony eventually declared war with them, and reluctantly the infant Connecticut Colony was quickly drawn into the conflict.\n\nThe Pequots greatly outnumbered the Colonial forces, but the English had superior weapons and tactics. They also had the guidance and support of numerous Indian allies who were tributaries to the Pequots, especially Mohegan Sachem Uncas, who formed a unique and lasting bond with Mason and also Wequash Cooke. This brief and decisive war, with the Mystic Massacre in particular, forever changed the complexion of American society. The battle at Mistick Fort was featured in the History Channel series \"10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed America,\" and is central to scholarly arguments in favor of proving localised Native American genocide in the colonial period. Following this victory, Mason was promoted to major and received numerous land grants as a reward for his services. Mason's Island at the mouth of the Mystic River remained in his family for over 250 years.\n\nIn 1640, an event took place that forever changed the political boundaries of the Connecticut River Valley. From its founding until that time, Springfield, Massachusetts (then called Agawam) had been administered by the Connecticut Colony, along with Connecticut's three other settlements at Wethersfield, Hartford, and Windsor. In the spring of 1640, grain was very scarce and cattle were dying of starvation. The nearby Connecticut River Valley settlements of Windsor (then called \"Matianuck\") and Hartford (then called \"Newtown\") gave power to William Pynchon, the founder of Springfield, to buy corn for all three English settlements. If the Indians would not sell their corn at market prices, then Pynchon was authorized to offer more money. The Indians refused to sell their corn at market prices, and then later refused to sell it at \"reasonable\" prices. Pynchon refused to buy it, believing it best not to broadcast the English colonists' weaknesses, and also wanting to keep market values steady.\n\nLeading citizens of what became Hartford were furious with Pynchon for not purchasing any grain. With Windsor and Wethersfield's consent, the three southerly settlements commissioned John Mason to travel to Springfield with \"money in one hand and a sword in the other.\" On reaching what became Springfield, Mason threatened the local Indians with war if they did not sell their corn at a \"reasonable price.\" The Indians capitulated and ultimately sold the colonists corn; however, Mason's intimidating approach led to the Indians' deepening distrust of the English colonists. Pynchon, an avowed \"man of peace,\" believed in negotiation with the Indians, whereas Mason believed in subduing Indians by force, if necessary. This philosophical difference led to Mason using \"hard words\" against Pynchon. Pynchon's settlement, however, agreed with him and his philosophy, and that same year voted to separate from the Connecticut Colony and be annexed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony. As this local controversy was heating up, the Massachusetts Bay Colony decided to reassert its jurisdiction over the land bordering the Connecticut River, realizing that it was valuable for farming.\n\nIn 1645, Sir Thomas Fairfax was made commander in chief, and he addressed a letter to Major Mason in Connecticut urging him to return to England, join his standard, and accept a Major-General's commission in the Parliamentary Army to serve in the English Civil War. Mason declined this offer and remained in Connecticut.\n\nIn 1647, Mason assumed command of Saybrook Fort which controlled the main trade and supply route to the upper river valley. The fort mysteriously burned to the ground but another improved fort was quickly built nearby. He spent the next twelve years there and served as Commissioner of the United Colonies, as the chief military officer, magistrate, and peacekeeper. He was continually called upon to negotiate the purchase of Indian lands, write treaties, or arbitrate some Indian quarrel, many of which were instigated by his friend Uncas. His leadership abilities were unrivaled, which prompted the New Haven Colony to offer him a very lucrative position as manager of their enterprise in relocating to the Delaware River area. However, he declined the offer and remained in Connecticut.\n\nIn 1659, Major Mason moved from the mouth of the Connecticut River to the head of the Thames River, together with his son-in-law Rev. James Fitch and most of the Saybrook residents, and founded the town of Norwich, Connecticut. The land \"nine miles square\" was purchased from Mohegan Sachem Uncas, who also signed over to Mason all the territory in his tribe's domain as a protector and administrator. Questions regarding title to these thousands of acres created legal disputes which lasted for seventy years; the Mohegan Land Case actually consisted of several cases and appeals making their way through various courts in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and even back in London, England before the Lords Commissioners. Several of the Major's Mason's descendants in the role of the Tribal overseers, went bankrupt and even died in England in the process of defending the Mohegan land rights.\n\nDuring his twelve years in Norwich, John Mason served for nine years as Deputy Governor (1660 to 1669), and he helped to write the Connecticut Charter. He served as acting Governor from 1661 to 1663 while Governor John Winthrop Jr. went to England to obtain approval of the Charter from King Charles II.\n\nJohn Mason was one of the most trusted men in Connecticut during his three and a half decades of residence there, in both civil and military matters. In his latter years, the formal colony records referred to him simply as \"the Major,\" without forename or surname.\nIn the summer of 1670, Mason acted as an intermediary between Roger Williams and the Connecticut government regarding a boundary dispute between Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n\nIn 1669, pleading old age and infirmities, he retired to a revered advisory position, but he suffered painfully in the last years of his life from cancer, which was then referred to as the \"strangury\". He died on January 30, 1672 at the age of seventy-two from complications related to cancer. He is buried, although unmarked, in the Post-Gager cemetery with the other founders of Norwichtown, Connecticut.\n\nJohn Mason married his first wife (name unknown) in 1634 at Dorchester; she died in the spring of 1638 at Windsor. They had a daughter named Israel who was born in the winter of 1635 at Windsor; she married John Bissell Jr. on June 17, 1657 at Windsor. They had nine children. He died in 1693 and it is uncertain when she died.\n\nMason married Anne Peck in July 1639 in Hingham, Massachusetts. Anne was born on November 16, 1619 in Hingham, Norfolkshire, England and died in 1671 in Norwich, Connecticut. She was the daughter of Rev. Robert Peck, who was born at Beccles, Suffolk, England in 1580. Peck was a talented and influential clergyman and Puritan who had fled his Hingham, Norfolk, England church after the crackdown by Archbishop Laud.\n\nMatthew Grant included \"Captain Masen\" in his list of \"some omitted in former records being gone yet had children born here\", and credited him with four children born in Windsor. These would include the daughter Israel by his first wife, and then Priscilla (b.1641), Samuel (b.1644), and John (b.1646) with second wife Anne.\n\nChildren born at Saybrook, Connecticut were Rachel (b.1648), Ann (b.1650), and Daniel (b.1652); and then Elizabeth was born at Stonington, Connecticut in 1654.\n\nMason's sons Samuel, John, and Daniel were also military officers and prominent civil servants. Many subsequent descendants served as military officers, doctors, lawyers, and reverends in America.\n\nMason's Island is named after John Mason, situated at the mouth of the Mystic River in Stonington, Connecticut. It was owned by the Mason family from 1651 to 1913.\n\nAfter the Civil War, a statue movement was sweeping the nation, and local citizens and organizations were erecting monuments of heroes and patriots everywhere. The prominent citizens of Mystic, Connecticut decided to create a larger than life bronze and granite monument of Major John Mason, the commander of the Colonial forces in the 1637 Pequot War, the very first declared and sustained conflict in the early colonies. In 1889, the John Mason statue, carved by sculptor James G. C. Hamilton, was placed at the intersection of Pequot Avenue and Clift Street in Mystic, near what was thought to be the location of the fortified Pequot village where the Mistick Massacre occurred. \n\nAfter the Pequot War, the Colonial government declared the once dominant Pequot Tribe to be extinct, even though a few survivors and descendants continued to remain in their former territory. They were ignored, along with occasional complaints about the statue being on the sacred site where their ancestors perished. The statue remained there for 103 years, until the early 1990s when the modern-day Pequots managed to obtain federal recognition and build a large gambling and entertainment empire. Former and new complaints about the statue could no longer be ignored and, in the spirit of a current political correctness movement, and studying the sensitivity and appropriateness of the statue's location on a cultural \"sacred site\"; a committee chartered by the Town of Groton, Connecticut recommended that it be relocated.\n\nIn 1996, the State of Connecticut (DEP/Parks Dept.) decided to relocate the statue of Major John Mason to the Palisado Green in Windsor, Connecticut at , which is where John Mason lived at the time of the war. The original plaque which glorified him for the war victory was removed and given to the Mystic River Historical Society and a new plaque replaced it, outlining the Major's entire career. This essentially re-birthed the statue to now represent John Mason in a more balanced and comprehensive manner for a lifetime of public service, including many prominent accomplishments as the principal founder of the Connecticut Colony.\n\nIn honor of Norwich's bicentennial in 1859, The Mason Monument Association was formed and money was donated to erect a Founders Monument in the original burial grounds at Bean Hill. Major John Mason was their leader and this monument is also referred to as the Mason Monument but includes the names of all the 38 original settlers.\n\nThere is a life-sized stone carving of Major John Mason on the Connecticut State Capitol building, as he was a preeminent founder of the Colony.\n\nOn 10 February 1634 \"Captayne Mason\" received a grant of in Dorchester. He drew of meadow beyond Naponset in lot #73.\n\nIn the Windsor land inventory on 28 February 1640, John Mason held seven parcels, six of which were granted to him: \"a home lot with some additions to it\", ; \"in the Palisado where his house stands and mead adjoining\" ; \"in the first mead on the north side of the rivulet, for mead and addition in swamp\" ; \"in the northwest field for upland\" \"with some addition on the bank side\"; \"over the Great River in breadth by the river twenty-six rods more or less, and continues that breadth to the east side of the west marsh, and there it is but sixteen rods in breadth and so continues to the end of the three miles\"; \"of land by Rocky Hill\"; and \"by a deed of exchange with Thomas Duy [Dewey] ... on the east side of the Great River in breadth eighteen rods more or less, in length three miles\".\n\nOn 5 January 1641 Connecticut court ordered \"that Captain Mason shall have of ground, for him and his heirs, about Pequot Country, and the dispose of 500 more acres to such soldiers as joined with him in the service when they conquered the Indians there\".\n\nOn 12 July 1644 John Mason of Windsor sold to William Hosford of Windsor in a little meadow with addition of swamp.\n\nOn 11 September 1651 \"the island commonly called Chippachauge in Mistick Bay is given to Capt. John Mason, and also of upland and of meadow near Mistick, where he shall make choice\". Henceforth, this island became known as Mason's Island, located at the mouth of the Mystic River.\n\nOn 14 March 1660 the \"jurisdiction power over that land that Uncas and Wawequa have made over to Major Mason is by him surrendered to this Colony. Nevertheless for the laying out of those lands to farms or plantations the Court doth leave it in the hands of Major Mason. It is also ordered and provided with the consent of Major Mason, that Uncus & Wawequa and their Indians and successors shall be supplied with sufficient planting ground at all times as the Court sees cause out of that land. And the Major doth reserve for himself a competence of land sufficient to make a farm\".\n\nOn 14 May 1663 the court granted \"unto the Major, our worshipful Deputy Governor, of land for a farm, where he shall choose it, if it may not be prejudicial to a plantation already set up or to set up, so there be not above of meadow in it\". On 13 October 1664, the \"Major propounding to the Court to take up his former grant of a farm, at a place by the Indians called Pomakuck, near Norwich, the Court grants liberty to him to take up his former grant in that place, upon the same terms as it was granted to him by the Court\".\nOn 20 May 1668 the \"Major desiring this Court to grant him a farm\" of about , for \"one of his sons, his desire is hereby granted (provided there be not above of meadow) and Lt. Griswold & Ensign Tracy are hereby desired to lay it out to him in some convenient place near that tract of land granted Jer[emiah] Adams, it being the place the Major hath pitched upon, the name of the place is Uncupsitt, provided it prejudice no plantation or former grant\".\n\nOn 9 May 1672 \"Ensign Tracy is appointed to join with Sergeant Tho[mas] Leffingwell in laying out to the Major and Mr. Howkins their grants of land according to their grants\".\n\nJohn Mason's descendants number in the thousands today.

In 1821, he co-operated with Amand Bazard, Jacques-Thomas Flotard, and others to found a secret association, \"La Charbonnerie\", modeled on the Italian Carbonari, with the object of launching an armed insurrection against the French government. The organization spread rapidly and widely, and made several abortive attempts to foment revolution. In one of these attempts, the affair at Belfort, Buchez was gravely compromised. However, the jury that heard his case did not find sufficient evidence to warrant condemnation. Failed insurrectionary attempts of Charbonnerie in Belfort (January and July), Thouars and Saumur (February), culminated in the September execution in Paris of the Four Sergeants of La Rochelle affair (\"Quatre Sergents de La Rochelle\").\n\nIn 1825 he graduated in medicine, and soon published \"Études de théologie, de philosophie et d'histoire\" (\"Studies in Theology, Philosophy, and History\"). About the same time, he became a member of the Saint-Simonian Society, presided over by Bazard, Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin, and Olinde Rodrigues. (The society was based on the ideas of Saint-Simon, an early socialist theoretician.) Buchez also contributed to its organ, the \"Producteur\", but he left this group because of the strange religious ideas of its \"Supreme Father,\" Enfantin. Buchez began to elaborate on his own original ideas, which he characterized as \"Christian socialism\". For the exposition and advocacy of his principles he founded a periodical called \"L'Européen\".\n\nIn 1833 he published an \"Introduction à la science de l'histoire ou science du développement de l'humanité\", which was received with considerable favor (2nd ed., improved and enlarged, 2 vols., 1842). Notwithstanding its prolixity, this is an interesting work. The part that describes the aim, foundation, and methods of the science of history is valuable; but what is most distinctive in Buchez's theory is the division of historical development into four great epochs originated by four universal revelations, of each epoch into three periods corresponding to desire, reasoning, and performance — and of each of these periods into a theoretical and practical age — is merely ingenious (see Flint's \"Philosophy of History in Europe\", i. 242-252).\n\nBuchez next edited, along with M. Roux-Lavergne (1802–1874), the \"Histoire parlementaire de la Révolution française\" (1833-1838; 40 vols.). This vast and conscientious publication is a valuable store of material for the early periods of the first French Revolution. There is a review of it by Thomas Carlyle (\"Miscellanies\"), the first two parts of whose own history of the French Revolution are mainly drawn from it.\n\nThe editors strongly admired the principles of Robespierre and the Jacobins. They also espoused the belief that the French Revolution was an attempt to fulfill Christianity's promise. In the \"\" (1839–1840), Buchez endeavored to co-ordinate, in a single system, the political, moral, religious, and natural phenomena of existence. Denying the possibility of innate ideas, he asserted that morality comes by revelation. Therefore, it is not only certain, but the only real certainty possible.\n\nAt the outset of the revolution of 1848, Buchez established the \"Revue Nationale\" to reach out to workers and all the democratic convictions. In the same fashion, Buchez had assisted, in September 1840, in the appropriation of the worker-owned and worker-operated newspaper, \"L'Atelier\" (\"The Workshop\"), a publication that was, at once, utopian, socialist, and Christian.\nPartly owing to the reputation he acquired by these publications, but more to his connection with the National newspaper and secret societies hostile to the government of Louis-Philippe, Revolution of 1848 raised him to the presidency of the Constituent Assembly. When the revolution of 1848 began on 24 February, Buchez, as a captain in the National Guard, took his unit to the Tuileries, where they witnessed the flight of Louis-Philippe. In the days that followed, Buchez became \"maire-adjoint\" (assistant mayor) of Paris, and was elected to the national constituent assembly of 1848.\n\nOn 15 May 1848, a popular nonviolent invasion of the assembly took place. This invasion was an attempt to express the essential needs of the working population of Paris and of the nation. Buchez was, at that time, president of the assembly. Faithful to his convictions and trust in the people, he did not call for the use of force to clear the chamber. This calm response earned Buchez scorn and loud criticism from prominent assembly members.\n\nTocqueville in his \"Recollections\" described this day, disdainfully recalling Buchez's conduct: \"Buchez\" he wrote, \"the president, whom some would make out to be a rascal and others a saint, but who, on that day, was a great blockhead, rang his bell with all his might to obtain silence, as though the silence of that multitude was not, under the circumstances, more to be dreaded than its cries.\" He speedily showed he did not possess the qualities needed in such a situation. He retained the position only for a short time. After the dissolution of the assembly he was not re-elected.\n\nThrown back into private life, he resumed his studies, and added several works to those already mentioned. A \"Traité de politique\" (published 1866), which may be considered as the completion of his \"Traité de philosophie\", was the most important of the productions of the last period of his life. His brochures are very numerous and on a great variety of subjects, medical, historical, political, philosophical, etc. He died on 12 August 1865. He found a disciple of considerable ability in A. Ott, who advocated and applied his principles in various writings.\n\n"}

{"id": "2241788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241788", "title": "Stagecast Creator", "text": "Stagecast Creator\n\nStagecast Creator is a visual programming language intended for use in teaching programming to children. It is based on the programming by demonstration concept, where rules are created by giving examples of what actions should take place in a given situation. It can be used to construct simulations, animations and games, which run under Java on any suitable platform.\n\nWhat is today known as Creator originally started as a project by Allen Cypher and David Canfield Smith in Apple's Advanced Technology Group (ATG) known as KidSim. It was intended to allow kids to construct their own simulations, reducing the programming task to something that anyone could handle. Programming in Creator uses graphical rewrite rules augmented with non-graphical tests and actions.\n\nIn 1994, Kurt Schmucker became the project manager, and under him, the project was renamed Cocoa, and expanded to include a Netscape plug-in. It was also repositioned as \"Internet Authoring for Kids\", as the Internet was becoming increasingly accessible. The project was officially announced on May 13, 1996. There were three releases:\n\n\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he began dismantling a number of non-productive departments. One of these was the ATG. Larry Tesler, Cypher, and Smith, left to form Stagecast Software after retaining the rights to the Cocoa system.\n\nApple went on to reuse the Cocoa name for the entirely unrelated Cocoa application framework, which had originated as OpenStep.\n\nCreator is based on the idea of independent \"characters\" that have a graphical appearance and non-graphical properties. Each character has a list of rules that determine how it behaves. The rules are created \"by demonstrating\" what the character does in a specific situation. Each graphical rewrite rule is a \"before / after\" rule, stating that when the \"before\" conditions of the rule are met, the \"after\" actions of the rule are performed.\n\nFor a simple example, consider a simulation showing a character walking across a field, jumping over any rocks it encounters. Such a simulation would start with the construction of the playfield, in this case a line of icons representing the grass and a few rocks. A character is then placed on the playfield and double-clicked to open a rule editor. The rule editor will start by displaying the current conditions, that is, the character is standing on the grass. Below is an area to place the various \"after\" conditions, in this case the user drags open the default grid to two spaces, drags the character into the new grid cell, say to the right, and closes the rule editor.\n\nIf the simulation is started at this point, the character will start walking across the playfield to the right until it reaches the first rock. Since there is no rule showing what should happen when a rock is to the character's right, the character simply stops. At this point the rule editor is opened again, but now it shows the new condition that applies, the character is to the left of a rock. The actions in this case would be two steps, the first showing the character moving up and to the right, the next down and to the right. When the simulation is re-run, the character will walk to the right, and then \"jump\" over the rocks. In this case the character will now stop moving when it reaches the side of the screen, and a new rule could be added at that point to \"wrap around\" to the left side again.\n\nAdditional rules can be added \"on the fly\" to flesh out the simulation. In this example additional rules would likely be added to allow the conditions to apply no matter which direction the character is walking, duplicating the existing set of two rules for movement to the left, and up and down. To make the simulation interactive, the \"automatic movement\" rules can be removed, and replaced by ones that move only when the cursor keys are held down, and jump only if the user presses space. Now the simulation becomes a simple game.\n\nMany new features were added to the system during its evolution from KidSim/Cocoa to Creator. These include the introduction of 'jars' as a means of object classification, a new z-variable that allows Creator to simulate a 3-D space (as a stack of 2-D sheets), the ability to control more than one character at a time, and the option to redraw the screen only after all moves in a turn have been made.\n\nIn order to ensure Creator's cross-platform compatibility, the entire system was ported to the Java programming language. As Cocoa, the system was a Mac-only product and included an 'Autoplayer' functionality that allowed a Cocoa simulation to be run as a stand-alone program on any Mac. With the port to Java, Creator simulations can be posted on a Web page and run as an applet.\n\n\n"}

Structuring a measure in this way is intended to minimize subjectivity or bias on the part of the individual administering the measure so that administering and interpreting the results does not rely on the judgment of the examiner. \n\nAlthough the term ‘objective test’ encompasses a wide range of tests with which most people are somewhat familiar (i.e. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Graduate Record Examination, and the Standardized Achievement Test), it is a term that arose out of the field of personality assessment, as a response and contrast to the growing popularity of tests known as \"projective tests\". These ‘projective tests’ require examinees to generate unstructured responses to ambiguous tasks or activities, the content of which is supposed to represent their personal characteristics (e.g. internal attitudes, personality traits).\n\nHowever, the distinction between objective and projective tests is misleading, as it implies that objective tests are not subject to the influence of bias. Although the fixed response style of objective tests does not require interpretation on the part of the examiner during the administration and scoring of the measure, responses to questions are subject to the examinee’s own response style and biases, in much the same way they are for projective measures; therefore, both test ‘types’ are vulnerable to subjective factors that may affect scores. Furthermore, understanding and giving meaning to the results of any assessment, projective and objective alike, is done within the context of an examinee’s personal history, presenting concerns, and the myriad of factors that can affect examinee's scores on the assessment. Thus, both objective and projective tests carry potential sources of bias and require judgment in interpretation to varying degrees. Rather than categorizing tests on the basis of overt but superficial test characteristics, the individual merits of a specific use of scores from a test should be evaluated.\n\n"}

Founded in 1912, the company expanded into France and then throughout Europe and Middle East during the 1920s. They expanded in the Americas during the 1950s and went public in 1958. The company continued to expand in Latin America and added Asian divisions during the 1970s and 1980s. A series of mergers and buyouts made Holcim one of the two largest cement manufacturers worldwide by 2014, roughly tied with rival Lafarge. In April 2014, the two companies agreed to a US$60 billion \"merger of equals\". The companies merged on 10 July 2015 to form LafargeHolcim as the new holding company.\n\nAs of 2014, Holcim does business in more than 70 different countries and employs 71,000 people. The company is the market leader in cement production in Australia, Azerbaijan, India, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Latin America.\n\nHolcim is headquartered in Jona, Switzerland and holds interests in more than 70 countries worldwide. They employ 71,000 people. Subsidiaries include St. Lawrence Cement (Canada), Aggregate Industries (the UK), and Holcim Apasco (Mexico). The company's products include cement, clinker, concrete, lime, and aggregates. They also offer consulting services, third party research and development, and land waste management services. Their largest business segment is the manufacture and distribution of cement and aggregates. As of 2014, Holcim's annual production capacity was 215 million tons. It has a BBB credit rating according to Fitch Ratings, with a 3.5 funds from operations to debt ratio.\n\nHolcim is the cement market leader in Australia, Azerbaijan, India, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Latin America. It is among the top few producers throughout Europe, North America, and Asia. Globally, Holcim and Lafarge are the two largest producers in terms of sales, as of 2014.\n\nHolcim was founded by Adolf Gygi in 1912 as \"Aargauische Portlandcementfabrik Holderbank-Wildegg\". The original headquarters were in Holderbank, (Lenzburg district, Canton of Aargau, ca. 40 km from Zürich). In 1914, the company merged with \"Rheintalischen Cementfabrik Rüthi\" owned by Ernst Schmidheiny. Schmidheiny took over leadership duties and began the company on a course of expansion.\n\nIn 1922, Holderbank, as the company was then known, expanded beyond the Swiss borders into France. Schmidheiny continued to expand, primarily by buying stakes in existing companies. By the end of the decade Holderbank held stakes in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Egypt. Positions in Lebanon and South Africa soon followed. Schmidheiny died in the 1930s and his sons, Ernst Jr. and Max, took over the business, splitting it into two divisions. Ernst took over the Holderbank building materials business, while Max oversaw the other lines. This organization scheme remained in place until the 1970s.\n\nAfter World War II, Hans Gygi, son of Adolf Gygi, took over leadership. He oversaw the company during the Swiss housing boom of the 1950s, and as Holderbank expanded into Canada, then throughout North and South America. The company went public in 1958 in order to raise more capital to fuel further expansion. Hydroelectric projects in Switzerland generated large concrete contracts, offsetting losses in Egypt when the country's government nationalized Holderbank's factories.\nDuring the early 1970s, growth in Brazil and Mexico improved the company's bottom line. The Schmidheiny brothers convinced shareholders that the company should consolidate holdings and merge with Schweizerischen Cement-Industrie-Gesellschaft. The combined company had annual revenue of 800 million Swiss francs and established Holderbank as one of the industries largest companies worldwide. The oil crisis of 1973 hit the industry hard as construction demand dried up in much of the world. Strong markets in Lebanon and South Africa allowed Holderbank to weather the storm. By 1976, revenue and profits had returned to pre-crisis levels.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Holderbank continued its expansion in Latin America and expanded into Asia and Spain for the first time. Thomas Schmidheiny took over leadership, overseeing the company as in expanded into Eastern Europe and experienced a boom in Spanish construction preceding the 1992 Summer Olympics. By 1986, Holderbank was the world's largest cement manufacturer. In the 1990s, the company consolidated its European holdings as the American market drove growth. Expansion into Eastern Europe and Russia continued.\n\nIn 2001, the company changed its name from \"Holderbank Financière Glaris\" to Holcim (short for Holderbank ciment). Asia drove growth in the 2000s, as the company saw more than 50% of its business come from emerging markets. In 2005, Holcim purchased Aggregate Industries for US$4.1 billion, entering the United Kingdom for the first time. That year, the company also expanded into India by acquiring a stakes in The Associated Cement Companies (ACC) and Ambuja Cement Eastern. In 2008, Holcim became the largest shareholder of China's Huaxin Cement with a 40% stake. In 2009, they acquired Cemex Australia.\n\nIn February 2012, Bernard Fontana became the first CEO of Holcim that was not part of the founding families.\n\nOn 7 April 2014, Holcim and Lafarge announced they had agreed to terms on a \"merger of equals\" valued at nearly $60 billion. The merger entails 10 Lafarge shares being converted into 9 Holcim shares. Holders of 86% of Lafarge shares accepted this offer in June 2015, according to Holcim, meaning that the merger would proceed. The new company would be based in Switzerland and have a manufacturing capacity of 427 million tons a year, which would vastly exceed the 227 million ton capacity of current industry leader Anhui Conch. Lafarge Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont will lead the new company, while Holcim's Wolfgang Reitzle will be chairman. Executives from both companies said the deal will save the new company 1.4 billion euros (US$1.9 billion) annually and create \"the most advanced group in the building materials industry.\"\n\nAnalysts said the deal could lead to further mergers within the industry and give competitors a chance to pick up assets at a bargain price.\n\nHolcim competitors include:\n"}

It is one measure of the skeletal component of the systemic disorder of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). The term \"renal osteodystrophy\" was coined in 1943, 60 years after an association was identified between bone disease and kidney failure.\n\nThe traditional types of renal osteodystrophy have been defined on the basis of turnover and mineralization as follows: 1) mild, slight increase in turnover and normal mineralization; 2) osteitis fibrosa, increased turnover and normal mineralization; 3) osteomalacia, decreased turnover and abnormal mineralization; 4) adynamic, decreased turnover and acellularity; and, 5) mixed, increased turnover with abnormal mineralization. A Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes report has suggested that bone biopsies in patients with CKD should be characterized by determining bone turnover, mineralization, and volume (TMV system).\n\nOn the other hand, CKD-MBD is defined as a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD manifested by either one or a combination of the following: 1) abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, or vitamin D metabolism; 2) abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength (renal osteodystrophy); and 3) vascular or other soft-tissue calcification.\n\nRenal osteodystrophy may exhibit no symptoms; if it does show symptoms, they include:\n\nRenal osteodystrophy has been classically described to be the result of hyperparathyroidism secondary to hyperphosphatemia combined with hypocalcemia, both of which are due to decreased excretion of phosphate by the damaged kidney.\n\nLow activated vitamin D levels are a result of the damaged kidneys' inability to convert vitamin D into its active form, calcitriol, and result in further hypocalcaemia. High levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 seem now to be the most important cause of decreased calcitriol levels in CKD patients.\n\nIn CKD, the excessive production of parathyroid hormone increases the bone resorption rate and leads to histologic bone signs of secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, in other situations, the initial increase in parathyroid hormone and bone remodeling may be slowed down excessively by a multitude of factors, including age, ethnic origin, sex, and treatments such as vitamin D, calcium salts, calcimimetics, steroids, and so forth, leading to low bone turnover or adynamic bone disease.\n\nBoth high and low bone turnover diseases are currently observed equally in CKD patients treated by dialysis, and all types of renal osteodystrophy are associated with an increased risk of skeletal fractures, reduced quality of life, and poor clinical outcomes.\n\nRenal osteodystrophy is usually diagnosed after treatment for end-stage kidney disease begins; however the CKD-MBD starts early in the course of CKD. In advanced stages, blood tests will indicate decreased calcium and calcitriol (vitamin D) and increased phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels. In earlier stages, serum calcium, phosphate levels are normal at the expense of high parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23 levels. X-rays will also show bone features of renal osteodystrophy (subperiostic bone resorption, chondrocalcinosis at the knees and pubic symphysis, osteopenia and bone fractures) but may be difficult to differentiate from other conditions. Since the diagnosis of these bone abnormalities cannot be obtained correctly by current clinical, biochemical, and imaging methods (including measurement of bone-mineral density), bone biopsy has been, and still remains, the gold standard analysis for assessing the exact type of renal osteodystrophy.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, renal osteodystrophy must be characterized by determining bone turnover, mineralization, and volume (TMV system) (bone biopsy). All forms of renal osteodystrophy should also be distinguished from other bone diseases which may equally result in decreased bone density (related or unrelated to CKD):\n\nTreatment for renal osteodystrophy includes the following:\n\nRecovery from renal osteodystrophy has been observed following kidney transplantation. Renal osteodystrophy is a chronic condition with a conventional hemodialysis schedule. Nevertheless, it is important to consider that the broader concept of CKD-MBD, which includes renal osteodystrophy, is not only associated with bone disease and increased risk of fractures but also with cardiovascular calcification, poor quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality in CKD patients (the so-called bone-vascular axis). Actually, bone may now be considered a new endocrine organ at the heart of CKD-MBD.\n\n"}

It was damaged during World War II, when it was flooded with water and silt, and despite a restoration in the post-War period it later closed.\n\nJust off the bay is the Houmets islets, mentioned by Victor Hugo who described Les Houmets, in his work \"The Toilers of the Sea\" (\"Les Travailleurs de la mer\").\n\nA small battery built in the 18th-century existed at Bordeaux until all trace of the site vanished due to quarrying.\n"}

The story is based on Spanish journalist Rosa Montero's novel of the same name (1997). The film stars Argentine actress Cecilia Roth, Mexican actor Kuno Becker, and Spanish actor Carlos Álvarez-Nóvoa. The cinematographer is Xavier Pérez Grobet.\n\nLucía, a children's book writer, is travelling to Brazil with her husband on vacation, when her husband disappears after going to the airport bathroom. She later learns that he was kidnapped by a group called the People Workers Party that wants 20 million pesos from her. Her husband frantically tells her to find the money in his aunt's safe deposit box. With the help of her neighbours, a Spanish Civil War veteran, and a young musician, Lucía sets out to find his kidnappers. She eventually discovers the truth about his disappearance after learning from the police that her husband is accused of being part of an elaborate embezzlement scam from within the Treasury Department of the government and may have possibly faked his kidnapping.\n\n\nThe film was shot over a period of eight weeks in and around Mexico City, as well as at the Puebla airport and the Sierra Gorda of Querétaro. In the United States the film was released under the name \"Lucía, Lucía\", since the producers thought the name \"La hija del caníbal\" (literally, \"The cannibal's daughter\") would lead audiences to believe the story was about a cannibal.\n\n\"Lucía, Lucía\" was not as successful as Serrano's first film \"Sexo, Pudor y Lágrimas\". Its box-office output in Mexico was MNX$10 million (under a million dollars). In Spain it was released on November 21, 2003 in 100 theaters. In the United States it had a box-office output of $269,586 in just 50 theatres. The film currently takes the spot of the 204th highest grossing foreign film in the United States.\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews, currently holding a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: \"A relatively simple mid-life crisis story is burdened by overly cumbersome plot devices.\"\n\nThe film was nominated for the following awards:\n"}

Work started in 1923, and the first prototype was flown in August 1926. Another airframe was built for static trials.

The shellac is derived from the raw material sticklac, which is a resin scraped from the branches of trees left from when the small insect, \"Kerria lacca\" (also known as \"Laccifer lacca\"), creates a hard, waterproof cocoon. When used in food and confections, it is also known as confectioner's glaze, resinous glaze, pure food glaze, natural glaze, or confectioner's resin.\n\nPharmaceutical glaze may contain 20–51% shellac in solution in ethyl alcohol (grain alcohol) that has not been denatured (denatured alcohol is poisonous), waxes, and titanium dioxide as an opacifying agent. Confectioner’s glaze used for candy contains roughly 35% shellac, while the remaining components are volatile organic compounds that evaporate after the glaze is applied.\n\nPharmaceutical glaze is used by the drug and nutritional supplement industry as a coating material for tablets and capsules. It serves to improve the product's appearance, extend shelf life and protect it from moisture, as well as provide a solid finishing film for pre-print coatings. It also serves to mask unpleasant odors and aid in the swallowing of the tablet.\n\nThe shellac coating is insoluble in stomach acid and may make the tablet difficult for the body to break down or assimilate. For this reason, it can also be used as an ingredient in time-released, sustained or delayed-action pills. The product is listed on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) inactive ingredient list.\n\nShellac is labeled as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the US FDA and is used as glaze for several types of foods, including some fruit, coffee beans, chewing gum, and candy. Examples of candies containing shellac include candy corn, Hershey's Whoppers and Milk Duds, Nestlé's Raisinets and Goobers, Tootsie Roll Industries's Junior Mints and Sugar Babies, Jelly Belly's jelly beans and Mint Cremes, Russell Stover's jelly beans, and several candies by Godiva Chocolatier and Gertrude Hawk. M&M's do not contain shellac.\n\nA competing non-animal-based product is zein, a corn protein. It is preferred by some vegans because shellac production can kill many insects.\n"}

On 17 August 1945, two days after the Japanese surrender, Indonesian nationalist leader Sukarno declared Indonesian independence. The Dutch viewed the Indonesian leadership as collaborators with the occupying Japanese, and were determined to reassert their control over the nation by force. Fighting broke out, which developed into a full-scale war of independence between Dutch forces and Indonesian republicans. By mid-1946, both sides were under pressure to negotiate. In July, 1946, Acting Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Hubertus van Mook organised a conference in Malino at which representatives from Borneo and eastern Indonesia backed the proposal for a federal United States of Indonesia with links to the Netherlands.\n\nOn 2 September 1946, the Dutch established a Commission-General to set up a new political structure for the Dutch East Indies. This four-member commission, headed by former Dutch Prime Minister Willem Schermerhorn traveled to Jakarta to negotiate with the republican delegation. These negotiations with the Indonesian authorities began on 7 October 1946 and a ceasefire in Java and Sumatra was agreed to and signed on 14 October. Recognizing their still weakened position following World War II, the Netherlands were more prepared to negotiate with the republic than they were later in the Indonesian National Revolution. In November, the negotiations then moved to Cirebon from where it was easier to communicate with Sukarno and Hatta. \n\nMost of the negotiations took place at the residence of the Kwee family of Ciledug, now a museum, in the hill station of Linggadjati around 25 km south of Cirebon, although the final document was actually initialed in Cirebon. The Dutch side comprised the following:\nOn the Republican side were:\nFormer British ambassador to Egypt Lord Killearn acted as intermediary in the early stages, but he was not needed as the two sides established good relations. The two sides initialed the draft agreement on 15 November. \n\nThe agreement comprised an introduction, 17 articles and a final clause. According to the terms, the Netherlands agreed to recognize the Republic as exercising \"de facto\" authority over Java, Sumatra and Madura (Article 1). The Republic would become one of three constituent states of the federal United States of Indonesia, along with the State of Borneo and the Great Eastern State, comprising the region of the Eastern Dutch East Indies known as the Great East. Any region that did not want to join the USI could determine its relationship with the USI and the Netherlands through a democratic process. (Articles 2, 3 & 4). The constitution of the USI would be drawn up by an elected Constituent Assembly. The Netherlands Indies, together with the Netherlands, Suriname, and the Netherlands Antilles, would form a Netherlands-Indonesian Union with the Dutch monarch as official head of this Union (Articles 5, 7 & 8). Both the United States of Indonesia and the Union which would be established by 1 January 1949 at the latest (Article 12). Once the agreement was signed, both parties would reduce their armed forces (Article 16). Any disputes regarding the agreement would be resolved by arbitration in the event that joint consultation failed. The last resort was to be a ruling by the president of the International Court of Justice.\n\nBoth sides made concessions. The republicans committed to the establishment of a federal Indonesian state, while the Dutch conceded the inclusion of Sumatra in the Republic of Indonesia as well as Java. The two sides reached a compromise on the form of the relationship between the USI and the Netherlands. The Dutch had wanted a political union (), while the republicans had wanted merely an alliance (). The final agreement was for the USI to be a \"sovereign and equal partner in a union\", although the Dutch succeeded in persuading the republicans to agree to the Dutch monarch being the head of this union.\n\nThe Dutch Commission-General subsequently issued an \"Elucidation\" to the agreement, interpreting it as a \"program of principles\" to bring the status of the Dutch kingdom into line with the political facts in the Dutch East Indies. On 10 December 1946, the Dutch government announced its own interpretation of the agreement in a statement from Foreign Minister Jan Jonkman. As a result of pressure from the Dutch Catholic Party, which wanted to conduct missionary activities in the West Papua, Jonkman stated that the region would not after all be handed over to the United States of Indonesia, a statement at odds with article 3 of the Linggadjati Agreement. On 19 December, the Dutch parliament ratified the agreement on the basis of the Commission General's Elucidation.\n\nAlthough the agreement called for the Dutch and the Republican sides to cooperate in the establishment of a federal system, van Mook began to do so unilaterally, and in December, organised the Denpasar Conference which resulted in the establishment of the State of East Indonesia. This increased Republican opposition to the agreement, especially from the Indonesian National Party, Masjumi and followers of Tan Malaka. This led to the establishment of an opposition group, the Republican Fortress (). Supporters of Prime Minister Sjahrir and the agreement, including the Socialist Party of Indonesia and the Communist Party of Indonesia formed the Left Wing (). In order to ensure ratification of the agreement, the Central Indonesian National Committee was increased in size through the appointment of government supporters and this, together with resignation threats from Indonesia leaders Sukarno and Hatta, ensured the agreement was ratified by the Indonesian side on 5 March 1947.\n\nThe agreement was signed in Jakarta at 5.30pm on 25 March 1947 in the presence of 70 guests from the Netherlands, Indonesia and other nations. The signing was followed by speeches from Schemerhorn, van Mook and Sjahrir. There were celebrations on the streets of Jakarta and Palembang, South Sumatra. However, the agreement had been interpreted differently by the two sides, particularly regarding the meaning of the terms \"cooperation\" and \"federal\".\n\nBoth sides were unhappy with the agreement, and one member and two advisers to the Commission-General resigned in protest after it was signed. The Dutch were unhappy with the Republic establishing foreign relations, including with the Arab League, and with the Indonesia maintaining governors in the area that had become the State of East Indonesia. Meanwhile, the Indonesians complained about Dutch establishment of states in East Indonesia and West Borneo. The Dutch public's reception of the agreement was mixed - a survey found 38% of respondents supporting the agreement and 36% opposing it. One telegram to members of the Dutch Parliament compared the Linggadjati agreement with the Dutch capitulation to Germany in 1940, questioning why the agreement \"extradited seventy million Indonesians to Sukarno\".\n\nOn 27 May 1947, the Commission General proposed the establishment of a federal council headed by a representative of the Dutch crown to serve as an interim government, as well as a joint police force and the regulation of food distribution. The Republic would not be allowed to have an independent foreign policy. The Dutch would cooperate with \"various political entities of Indonesia\" rather than exclusively the Republic. The Dutch side asked for a response in 14 days. The Indonesian side viewed this as an ultimatum - capitulate to the Dutch or face military action as it would mean \"de jure\" Dutch sovereignty over Indonesia. Sjahrir agreed to an interim government, but with the Republic comprising half the membership and East Indonesia and Borneo the other half, with no Dutch participation. He also rejected a combined police force. The Dutch rejected these counter-proposals, but the concessions that Sjahrir had made cost him political support, leaving him fatally weakened. He resigned on 27 June. Sukarno then declared a state of emergency and took personal charge of the negotiations.\n\nOn 29 June, van Mook wrote to Sukarno to repeat the main points that he believed must be agreed on, including continuing Dutch sovereignty and the joint police force. New Prime Minister Amir Sjariffuddin accepted the \"de jure\" Dutch authority, but refused to agree to the joint police force. The Dutch then also demanded an end to Republican hostilities, and the food blockade of Dutch-controlled areas by midnight on 16 July. The Republicans agreed to a ceasefire if the Dutch would also be bound by it. The Indonesian side also suggested arbitration under Article 17 of the agreement. However, on 20 July the Dutch abrogated the Linggadjati Agreement and following a recommendation by van Mook, Dutch Prime Minister Louis Beel ordered the army to commence military intervention. This began on the night of 20-21 July in form of Operation Product.\n\n\n\n"}

It was produced by Robert Stigwood and released by Universal Pictures on December 22, 1978.\n\nThe film was shot in Malibu, California from April to July 1978 and also marked the end of Travolta's three-film contract with Stigwood, following \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) and \"Grease\" (1978).\n\nTrisha Rawlings (Lily Tomlin) is a wealthy, middle-aged Beverly Hills socialite suffering from loneliness following a separation from her philandering husband Stu (Bert Kramer). One day at a pharmacy, she meets Vick \"Strip\" Harrison (John Travolta), a suave young drifter she met briefly in the recent past when he worked as a car valet. He becomes infatuated with her, follows her to her Malibu beach house, hangs around despite her cold demeanor, and offers her pills in an attempt to woo her.\n\nTrisha is initially annoyed by Strip's flirtation but eventually reciprocates his affections, although not quite to the same degree he feels for her. When he leaves her house, she goes after him and they have lunch, officially beginning their rocky relationship. She enjoys spending time with him but the age and class differences make her feel ashamed.\n\nWhen they attend a photography exhibition together, they run into Stu, which makes the situation uncomfortable. Once they return home, they argue over their relationship. Strip leaves, but Trisha tracks him down and they reconcile.\n\n\nA paperback novelization of the screenplay was written by Darcy O'Brien and published by Ballantine Books in January 1979 as a promotional tie-in.\n\nMoment by Moment: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture was released on vinyl, cassette tape and 8-track tape by RSO Records in January 1979.

As romantic drama it's pretty tepid. That the two stars look enough alike to be brother and sister is no help, and though Miss Wagner's camera comes in for some tactful close-ups of flesh in the love scenes, they are singularly unerotic. One has the impression that these two lovers would prefer to be doing something else.\" \"Variety\" said that the film \"has to rate as one of the major disappointments of 1978. What seemed like inspired casting on paper, the teaming of John Travolta and Lily Tomlin, fails badly in execution.\" Gene Siskel gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and called it \"a thoroughly awkward, frequently laughable love story that Travolta would do well not to defend, but to simply forget and move on to his next project. Chalk it up to working with the wrong people at the wrong time.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"The circumscribed nature of Jane Wagner's screenplay and the hazy nature of her direction tend to divorce the film from any semblance of reality, both social and erotic. For all practical purposes 'Moment by Moment' is a two-character idyll, concentrated at a location—the heroine's Malibu Colony beachhouse—that seems imaginary.\" Gilbert Adair of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" stated, \"Critics are fond of attributing a film's badness to some hypothetical computer; this truly terrible movie might have been made by HAL in his most maudlin 'Bicycle-built-for-two' mood, as the plugs were being pulled out.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" offered a lonely defense of the film, writing, \"There have been many complaints that there is a lack of chemistry between the stars and that their dialogue is banal in the utmost ... Yet for those of us who respond to the intense concern Wagner projects for Tomlin and Travolta, there actually is chemistry between them and what they have to say to each other sounds lifelike rather than merely trite. At any rate, Tomlin and Travolta clearly have trusted in Wagner completely, giving themselves entirely to their roles, with Tomlin underplaying to Travolta's engaging projection of vulnerability.\"\n\nDuring filming of \"Moment by Moment\", a Los Angeles magazine reported from the set at the time: \"The chemistry between Tomlin and Travolta began to rival that between Menachem Begin and Yassar Arafat.\" A crew staff was also quoted saying: \"Two weeks into the shooting on location in Malibu, there was nobody on the set that didn't know we were in the middle of a turkey. It was like being on the voyage of the damned.\"\n\nTwo years after its release, Lily Tomlin said of the experience: \"John and I were totally unprepared. We thought it was a sweet, small, lightly funny movie. We were not prepared for what others thought. It's the one thing that all performers live in fear of—total failure. And when it happens and you survive, I think you're probably in a much better place. It's made me less cautious. It made me place more importance on the experience of working with other artists than on the reaction of critics or the public.\"\n\nThe film remains a \"camp classic,\" with a reputation sufficient to have prompted \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" producers to try (unsuccessfully) to obtain the rights necessary to broadcast it and mock it on their show. Brad Jones of The Cinema Snob claimed in his review: \"Everything is so wrong [with this movie], in so many ways, that even an actual Train Wreck would stop to look at it. And because of that, more people should be talking about this thing\".\n\n"}

Extreme poverty, lack of formal education and domestic strife marked Cahill’s early childhood. When he was young, his father abandoned the family and his mother sent the young Cahill to live and work on a farm owned by an Icelandic family 50 miles away where he was mistreated. His mother remarried and had another child, Anna. That marriage also did not last. After two difficult years with the Icelandic farmers, Cahill ran away at first to neighboring farms where he found work and eventually to Winnipeg, in search of distant cousins. The cousins refused to take him in and he ended up in an orphanage. A Gaelic-speaking family in a nearby cooperative farm community adopted Cahill and he was able to attend school regularly for the first time. After several years with the Gaelic family, he returned to North Dakota in search of his mother only to discover that his mother and step-sister had moved. Eventually he found them working on a nearby tenant farm in 1902. His mother had remarried to a younger man named Samson, and she and her son quarreled. Once again, he left home and did not see his mother again for 45 years.\n\nCahill's employment in the field of visual arts began in 1921 when he was hired by John Cotton Dana at the Newark Museum and the Society of Independent Artists to write publicity about their activities. As a former journalist and editor, Cahill had learned how to write effectively and he helped create new interest both organizations in the media. Through his friend, the artist John Sloan, Cahill knew many of the leading artists of the day and he encouraged Dana to purchase works by contemporary artists for the museum’s growing collection. After Dana's death in 1929, Cahill organized the first major museum surveys of American Folk Art at the Newark Museum in 1930 (\"American Primitives\") and 1931 (\"American Folk Sculpture\"). While at Newark, he also published fiction, essays and short stories including art criticism for the magazines \"Shadowland\" \"International Studio\" and the \"New York Herald Tribune\". He published a novel, \"Profane Earth\" in 1927 and, in 1930, \"A Yankee Adventurer\" a biography of Frederick Townsend Ward and his role in the Taiping Rebellion of 1861. At Newark, he met his future wife, Dorothy Canning Miller whom he married in 1938. Together with the galleries Edith Halpert of the Downtown Gallery, Cahill published a monograph on Pop Hart in 1928, Max Weber in 1930 and Jules Pascin in 1931. Halpert and Cahill also launched a magazine called Space that ran for three issues in January, March and June, 1930.\n\nIn 1932–33, Cahill served as acting director of the Museum of Modern Art when the founding director, Alfred H. Barr Jr., took a leave of absence. He organized several notable exhibitions including \"American Sources of Modern Art\", \"American Folk Art: Art of the Common Man in America\" and a survey exhibition, \"American Painting and Sculpture 1862–1932\". In 1934, he directed the First Municipal Art Exhibition at Rockefeller Center in New York; the exhibition coincided with the destruction of the mural by Diego Rivera and many of the artists threatened to withdraw. When Cahill left Newark, he employed Dorothy Miller as his assistant on his various projects. At the First Municipal Art Exhibition, Miller stepped in as Director when Cahill landed in the hospital and was unable to continue which led to her later position as curator at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nFrom August 1935 until April 1943, Cahill was the national director of the Federal Art Project, the role for which he is best known today. His contributions to the research, documentation and understanding of the visual arts in America were wide-ranging—from the earliest crafts of the Native Americans to the abstract expressionists. In the 1920s, his early endorsement of American folk art as well as the early American modernists introduced their work to a larger public through exhibitions, catalogues and criticism. During his tenure of the WPA, his oversight of the Index of American Design established a greater understanding of the variety and quality of American iconographic imagery.\n\nCahill proved to be an imaginative, sensitive and skillful administrator. Under his leadership community art centers were established in over 100 towns and cities nationwide, murals drawing upon the geographical environment were painted in public buildings throughout the country, and some 10,000 artists and craft workers were sustained through the Great Depression. An entire generation of artists was nurtured, their work exhibited, and an expanded public for art was created.\n\nIn 1938, Cahill married Dorothy Canning Miller, curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. The following year, he took a leave of absence from the WPA to stay in New York City and direct a large survey exhibition at the 1939 World’s Fair, \"American Art Today\". Through Miller, he continued to meet new artists and he was an avid and interested spectator of all of the programming at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nWhen the Federal Arts Project ended in 1943, Cahill returned to New York to concentrate on writing novels and essays. Hampered by various illnesses after his busy tenure as Director of the Federal Art Project and a severe heart attack in 1947, he managed to complete two novels, \"Look South to the Polar Star\", in 1947, and \"The Shadow of My Hand\", in 1956, set in the Midwest of his youth. In the same year he began studying poetry with Stanley Kunitz, and taped a memoir for the Columbia University Oral History Project. He also received a Guggenheim Fellowship for work on his novel \"Stone Dreamer\", which was left unfinished at his death in 1960.\n\nCahill died on July 8, 1960 in Stockbridge, Massachusetts where he is buried in the town’s cemetery.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2241876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241876", "title": "OFI Crete F.C.", "text": "OFI Crete F.C.\n\nOFI Football Club (, \"Club of Fans of Heraklion 1925\"), is a Greek professional football club based in Heraklion, on the island of Crete. It is a part of the OFI multi sports club. Outside Greece, the club is generally known as OFI Crete, however, the name \"Crete\" is not actually part of the club's official title. The team competes in the Super League, the top division of the Greek football league system, and hosts home games at the Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium.\n\nOFI is the Cretan club with the most continuous appearances in the Greek first division. It has won one Greek Cup (1986–87) and one Balkans Cup, while they have competed seven times in UEFA competitions.\n\nThe club was founded in the autumn of 1925 by a group of Cretan athletes exercising at the same gym in Heraklion. They registered a new sports club under the name Omilos Filathlon Irakleiou (acronym OFI) which means \"Heraklion Sports Club\". The club's official scope was to participate at all kinds of athletic events and exhibitions. During the first OFI's years, the club's founders made up the majority of the members.\n\nThe years preceding World War II were a very difficult period not only for Crete, but for Greece in general. Thus, it was extremely difficult for OFI to travel and participate in national football tournaments. As a result, OFI was limited to matches around the island of Crete and particularly with other football clubs based in Heraklion. Strangely enough, these local matches were more frequent in comparison to the official ones of former periods. Even though official documentation does not exist, elderly fans of OFI believe that the team played around 400 matches before the Germans finally occupied Crete.\n\nDuring occupation of Crete in World War II competitions were suspended and players signed up to fight, resulting in the deaths of many players. In the first period after WW2 the football tournament restarted in Greece with a single Championship, the \"First Division\", in which only major football clubs from Athens and Thessaloniki participated, including a few teams which qualified through preliminary rounds. However, it was almost impossible for a team coming from the province to take part in it.\n\nThis situation arose because the Hellenic Football Federation structured a system in which football teams from around the country had to play many preliminary rounds before proceeding to the national championship. As a result, even though OFI was the top football team in Crete, they could not qualify to the national tournament.\n\nAfter 1956, the system in Greece changed slightly. Advantages were that in some seasons the preliminary rounds were organized in groups of a few teams, where the champions of each group were promoted directly to the championship of the same season's First Division. One of those seasons was in 1957–58. OFI played preliminary games in a group of 4 teams, where they finished in first place. Thus, OFI, for the first time in its history, participated in the Greek National Championship. However, the team could not stand the frequent trips around Greece and finished in last position. Up to 1962, when the official 2nd Division Championship was organized, OFI tried again many times, but unsuccessfully, to take part in the competition of the 1st Division again.\n\nIn 1962–63 the official Greek 2nd division league was set up for first time. OFI was one of the teams that participated in the league and completed the season in 9th position. In 1963–64 and 1964–65, OFI finished in 3rd and 5th position respectively.\n\nIn 1965–66, OFI were the champions of the 2nd Division of Greek football and only one step away from promotion to the official 1st National Division of Greek football.\nYet, the Hellenic Football Federation decided that even the champions of the 2nd Division had to play preliminary games in order to be promoted.\n\nOFI lost in the play-off matches and remained in the 2nd Division. In 1966–67 the disappointment was huge, even though OFI ended in 3rd position. Everyone on the island of Crete was feeling that the moment where they could see the pride of their island in the top league was very close.\nIn 1967–68, OFI finished in 2nd position and went into play-off games with the bottom team of the 1st division. The final match of the play-offs was to take place in the city of Chania, on 26 June 1968. OFI, with the help of 10,000 Cretans thrashed the team from the 1st division with a 3–0 win and made the dreams of thousands of supporters come true. OFI was an official member of the 1st National Division.\n\nOFI's debut in the national 1st division was very difficult. \"Omilos\" ended the first round in 15th position. It was a very difficult task to remain in the league. However, in the 2nd round the Cretans played magnificently and finally finished in 12th place. In the next season OFI had already gained the experience of playing in the top league of Greek football. The \"Snakes\" finished in 13th place, but the strange thing was that OFI remained unbeaten in almost all of their home games in Heraklion. Only two teams managed to survive and leave Crete with an away win. Thus, even if OFI was not a feared opponent, all the other teams were anxious when taking the trip to the island of Crete.\n\n1970–71 was the worse season the team from Heraklion ever had in the 1st Division. OFI ended in 17th position and was relegated for the last time in their history to the 2nd division. The whole season was a tragedy for the Cretans. OFI had to meet \"old friends\" from the 2nd division again and start battling again in order to be promoted for a second time.\n\nOFI had been relegated again, but this time the 2nd division had changed entirely. After all, the championship had been more officially organized and opponents were tougher than before.\n\nOFI spent another 5 seasons in the 2nd division, from 1971–72 to 1975–76. During the first season, the team was continually in 1st place.\nHowever, at the end of the season, OFI's good performances deteriorated and they finally finished 4th. In 1972–73 the management decided on a complete overhaul of the squad. In these circumstances, the 13th position OFI achieved was predictable, yet a new era of the stars of OFI had just begun. In the next season OFI finished 6th and in 1974–75 they finished 5th. In the next season the league was divided again into two groups, each of 20 teams. The champions of each group would be promoted directly to the First National Division. OFI couldn't afford to miss this chance.\nEverything started perfectly for \"Omilos\" in 1975–76. They finished 1st at the end of the first round with a huge lead over the runners-up and then finished the season as champions. The whole island of Crete was celebrating the promotion of OFI to the 1st division. Up to the present, (2007), OFI have never been relegated again.\n\nDuring the first 3 seasons of OFI's presence in the 1st Division, the Greek championship still had an amateur status. In 1976–77, even though OFI were rookies, they finished in 6th place and gained the admiration of the whole country. In addition Dimitris Papadopoulos finished the top goal scorer of the League season. The following two seasons OFI finished 8th and 7th respectively, a period in which OFI was never once defeated in Crete. Even the \"heavyweights\" of the league (Panathinaikos, Olympiacos, AEK & PAOK) struggled to win any points when making the trip to the Genti Koule on island of Crete.\n\nThe championship in Greece was professionalized in the 1979–80 season and in the middle of that term the Vardinogiannis group bought the football club of OFI with Theodoros Vardinogiannis being the major shareholder. During that season the only team that beat OFI at home in Crete was Panathinaikos. The Athenian team took the victory in Heraklion extremely easily with a score line of 0–3. It was the only loss endured by Cretans on the island that year, after all games had been completed OFI finished in 11th position. The next season Panathinaikos embarked on their first set of experiments on OFI. Young players came from all over the country in order to play for \"Omilos\". Partly because of this experimentation by their new owners OFI only managed 13th position in the League. The 1981–82 campaign saw OFI finish in 9th place and the following 1982–83 season in 7th. It seemed clear that Theodoros Vardinogiannis wanted OFI to be a stronger team in the championship. He tried to achieve that, not by spending money for good players, but by sending 2nd hand players from his other team Panathinaikos or young players that could possibly be useful to OFI, but primarily, for Panathinaikos in the future when the time was right. Thus, in 1983–84, three goalkeepers, one midfielder and one defender came from the Athenian team to Crete. \n\nThe continuing experimentation caused OFI to be disappointed yet again. OFI finished in 8th place, exactly the same position they finished next season too. Although OFI's results were not wonderful, this group of fresh players had gained experience and started to play like a team. The one thing that was missing was a good coach, who could get the best out of each player. This man arrived the following season.\n\nIn 1985, OFI appointed Dutch Eugène Gerards as the head coach, who remained for a legendary 15 years. This is still the record tenure for a coach in the Greek League, and will be a feat that lives long in the memory of Cretans. Gerards' first 3 years at the helm in Crete were nothing short of amazing. In 1985–86, OFI finished 2nd in the league and only missed out on becoming champions by 5 points. Gerards continued his revolution with a 3rd-place finish in 1986–87 and 4th place in 1987–88. As Gerards' OFI continued to achieve high finishes in the Greek Championship the team from Crete did something wonderful 21 June 1987. In the Olympic Stadium in Athens they defeated Iraklis 3–1 on penalties winning the Greek Cup. The game had finished 1–1 after regular and extra time. With string league position and victorious in the Cup OFI was at that time one of the major players in Greek football.\nThe 1987–88 season was special for Cretans for another reason too – it was the first time in league history that OFI finished in a higher position than Panathinaikos, beating them 2–1 in Heraklion on the way, with a goal in last minute from Stefanos Vavoulas.\nThis golden era also saw OFI participate in European competition – UEFA Cup 1986 and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1987.\n\nOn 7 June 1989, OFI won the Balkans Cup by beating Radnički Niš 3–1 in Serres.\n\nIn the following seasons (1989–90, 1990–91, 1991–92) OFI wasn't as successful. OFI finished 6th, 7th and 6th respectively, missing UEFA Cup participation by a few points. On 27 May 1990, OFI made the biggest overthrow in Greek football, as the club losing to 50' with 4–0 from Olympiacos in Karaiskakis Stadium, ending with 4–5. In June 1990, OFI played once again in the final of the Greek Cup, this time against Olympiacos. The game took place in Olympiacos' home stadium and OFI lost 4–2.\n\nIn June 1991, OFI played in the final of the Pre-Mediterranean Cup, against AEK Athens. The game took place in Georgios Kamaras Stadium and OFI lost 1–0.\n\nDuring the last of those three seasons, OFI brought a young Argentinian star to Crete – Victor Hugo Delgado. However, there was little time for Cretans to enjoy the benefits of his talent as he was soon transferred to Panathinaikos.\n\nIn season 1992–93, OFI was in great form once again. OFI finished 4th in the Championship and qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup tournament. The season's great star for OFI was Nikos Nioplias. At the end of the previous season the Vardinogiannis family decided that he might become useful to Panathinaikos, so he became the 3rd player to move to Athens from OFI. Without the team's great star, OFI only managed a 7th-place finish in the 1993–94 Championship. But despite those facts the name of OFI was heard loud and clear all around Europe. That season OFI achieved the unthinkable – they eliminated Slavia Prague in the 1st round of the UEFA Cup and Atlético Madrid in the 2nd round (both 2–1 on aggregate). Nobody in Europe could believe that an unknown quantity like OFI could ever knock out of Europe such illustrious opposition. The famous cup run came to an end when OFI was eliminated in the 3rd round by Portuguese club Boavista (Round of 16). Despite the disappointment there was pride for Cretans to be taken in that their team was the most successful Greek team in European competition that season. \nIn 1994–95, Panathinaikos were in dire need of a striker, and OFI had 2 top rated strikers from the previous season, Nikos Machlas and Alexis Alexoudis. Even though Panathinaikos wanted Machlas, he himself refused to go to Athens, and as a result, Panathinaikos grabbed Alexoudis. OFI ended in the 9th position this year. In the next season, Eugène Gerards tried to build a new team with young players. Yet the Dutchman had lost 2 great players to Panathinaikos and Nikos Machlas was transferred to Vitesse Arnhem. OFI finished 5th and missed qualification for the UEFA Cup in the last game of the season.\n\n1996–97 was an amazing season for \"Omilos\". With the participation of Nikos Nioplias (Panathinaikos did not need him anymore, so he was transferred back to OFI), OFI was in 2nd place before the winter break and four of their players were part of the Greek National Team.\nOn the last day of the transfer period, Panathinaikos grabbed Kostas Konstantinidis, the best defender of OFI's squad. Finally OFI finished 3rd in the championship by humiliating Panathinaikos one week before the end and leaving the team from Athens in 5th place, outside the positions leading to UEFA competitions. The whole island of Crete was again celebrating the great performance of OFI.\n\nIn the next two seasons, OFI finished in 7th and 8th position respectively, suffering constant humiliations by Panathinaikos in matches between the two, as revenge for what happened in May 1997. In addition to that, Kostas Kiassos, a great OFI midfielder, was the next 'victim' and was transferred to Panathinaikos. Nevertheless, OFI resumed their successful UEFA Cup campaigns. The pride of Crete eliminated Icelandic team KR Reykjavik in the second qualifying round (3–1 on aggregate) and Hungarian team Ferencváros in the 1st round proper (4–2 on aggregate, with an unforgettable 3–0 victory in Crete). OFI's European dream was ended by AJ Auxerre in the 2nd round of the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn the year 2000 and after 15 successful years, Eugène Gerards announced his retirement from OFI's bench as the team finished 4th in the championship. It was the last time that OFI gained a position that lead to European competitions, and the last season that OFI was considered one of the top teams in Greece.\n\nThe new century found OFI unstable and close to relegation almost every year. While Nioplias and Machlas retired, the team partly suffered from a series of bad rosters and managers. In 2001, OFI really struggled to remain to the 1st League. The next two years, OFI managed to play a little better, thus avoiding low positions easier. But then the dark years came: OFI avoided relegation every year, for one or two points difference.\n\nPresident Fanouris Vatsinas appointed German Reiner Maurer as a coach in the summer of 2006. Maurer had the team playing greater football, even competing for a European place since the Gerards era. In the 2007 summer, OFI played in the Intertoto cup, but under-performed. The 2007–08 season found the club fighting to avoid relegation once again, and Maurer was sacked. Giorgos Paraschos was brought as a temporary manager, and he was eventually replaced by Czech, František Straka before the start of the new season.\n\nIn 2009, OFI suffered from the bad presidency of Fanouris Vatsinas, who was asked by the fans to leave the club. Furthermore, former player Machlas offered a great amount of money in order to purchase the team. OFI started with awful results, Straka was dismissed and Ioannis Matzourakis came to fill his position. During the 2008–09 season, OFI struggled to remain to the Greek Super League, but failed and is in fact relegated to the second division after finishing 16th.\n\nSince relegation OFI has gone into 'meltdown'.\nOnce the season had ended the majority of the club's senior players filed claims against club's president Fanouris Vatsinas for hundreds of thousands of euros in unpaid wages. As the non payment of wages was also a breach of contract many of them also freed themselves from their professional contracts with the club and sought new teams for the forthcoming season.\n\nIt took OFI two years to eventually return to the Super League, under a new administration led by former OFI scoring legend Nikos Machlas. Despite managing an impressive 6th-place finish in the 2013−14 season, severe financial debts around the €12 million range would not allow the club to relive its past glory days in top-flight. OFI quickly fell behind in the league Table during the 2014–15 season. On 21 March 2015, OFI withdrew from professional competitions, as the administration failed to meet the club's pressing financial obligations. In a symbolic gesture, the 15 players who still comprised the club's roster walked on the pitch of the Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium on that day (before match-day 29) and waived OFI's fans farewell. After 47 consecutive years in professional competitions, OFI was relegated to amateur status.\n\nAs a result, the professional football department merged with its parent sports club, which opened up winding-up proceedings and appointed liquidators for the bankrupt Football Club, a process that would allow a new football department of OFI to compete in the amateur Gamma Ethniki (the third tier of the Greek football league system under new leadership, free of the financial obligations of the previous administration. OFI, therefore played in the third division for the first time in its history during the 2015−16 season, managing instant promotion after winning the Division title. After spending two seasons in the Football League, OFI eventually achieved a return to the Super League as 2017−18 Second Division champions, alongside fellow historic top-tier regulars Aris Thessaloniki.\n\nOn 4 October 2018, Professional Sports Committee of Greece announced that Michael Bousis is the new major shareholder of OFI and in a few days (on 10 October to be exactly) he will follow a second \"seal\", that of football club, to take over the leadership of the administration.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, the Professional Sports Committee of Greece announced that team Executive Vice President Angelo P. Palivos and his brother Gregory Palivos, secured ownership and control of 36.4% of the team's shares. The brothers both serve on the teams Board of Directors on behalf of the Palivos family of Las Vegas, Nevada & Chicago, Illinois.\n\nOFI's crest features a white shield, with a diagonal black ribbon reading the club's acronym spelled in Greek (Greek: «ΟΦΗ»). In 2016, the club's foundation date «1925» was added to the crest as a result of the new Football Club re-establishment.\n\nThe colours that OFI used were black and white, because none of the existing sports clubs had the same colour combination in Crete.\n\nSponsorships:\n\nOFI's stadium is Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium, a stadium in Heraklion, Crete, Greece. It was built in 1951 (not at its present state) as the home stadium of OFI. The stadium is commonly known by its nickname, \"Yedi Kule\" (\"\"Seven Towers\"\" in Turkish). The historic ground of OFI was constructed in 1951 and after the death of the historic leader of the club it was named \"Theodoros Vardinoyannis\". The opening of the stadium took place on 11 November 1951 with the football game of OFI Crete with the team of Α.Σ.Δ.Α.Ν. (English: A.S.D.A.N.) (something like the current national team) and the result was a defeat for OFI, 4–1, a result that had a little meaning compared with the benefits that the Cretan club had won. At last, the largest Cretan club acquired its own \"home\", that would roof all the faithful of the new football ideals developed in Iraklion, Crete. The stadium was built on the ruins of a Christian and a Jewish cemetery and that in the area where the pitch is located, there were two big holes, remaining structures of German army guns from the World War II occupation.\nThe highest attendance recorded at Yedi Kule is 12,391 for OFI's match against Olympiacos on 25 September 1988. OFI won the game 2–1.\n\nOFI has a big fan base in Crete. Most popular organized fan clubs are the \"Snakes 4 Heraklion club\" and \"S.F Cretans 4 T. Papadopoulos\". \n\nOFI fans have good relations with the fans of PAOK, a friendship that started in October 1987 when OFI faced Atalanta for 1987–88 Cup Winners' Cup at Toumba Stadium and numerous PAOK fans supported the Cretans.\n\nOFI has enjoyed a fierce rivalry with other local Super League side, Ergotelis. The first ever game between Ergotelis and OFI, a friendly match in 1929, ended after 35 minutes. Ergotelis were ahead by one goal, when the game had to be abandoned after violence between the players broke out. Under the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, a legislation determined that every regional Greek city should be represented by one football team. At that time, both OFI and Ergotelis used to play in the Second National division (Football League). Αt the end of the 1966–67 season, Ergotelis finished 8th, while OFI finished in a higher position, leading to Ergotelis' relegation. The legislation also allowed the remaining teams in the second division to sign players of the relegated ones, and thus five Ergotelis players were transferred to OFI. In the years to come Ergotelis languished in the lower leagues. This led to various controversies, especially since Ergotelis' come back, at the early 2000s. This rivalry has shown signs of diminishing over the years, with OFI fans attending newly promoted Ergotelis' games in the Super League during the club's first season in the competition, and Ergotelis loaning their longtime scoring legend Patrick Ogunsoto to a financially weakened Beta Ethniki side OFI for no fee, as an attempt to assist the latter in their struggle to return to the Super League.\n\n\n\n\nBest position in bold.\n\nKey: 3R = Third Round, 4R = Fourth Round, 5R = Fifth Round, GS = Group Stage, R16 = Round of 16, QF = Quarter-finals, SF = Semi-finals.\n\n \n\n\n\nOfficial websites\nNews sites\nOther\n"}

He was sometimes credited as Rudolph Acosta.\n\nAcosta was born to Jose Acosta and Alexandrina Perez de Acosta on July 29, 1920 in the disputed American territory of Chamizal outside of El Paso, Texas. His father, a carpenter, moved the family to Los Angeles, where Acosta was raised and graduated from Lincoln High School. Acosta studied drama at Los Angeles City College and UCLA and he appeared at the Pasadena Playhouse. At the age of 19, he received a scholarship to the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City where he studied for three years. In 1943, during World War II, Acosta enlisted in the United States Navy where he worked in Naval Intelligence.\n\nAfter the war, Acosta worked on stage and in films which eventually led to a bit part in John Ford's 1947 film \"The Fugitive\", directed by Emilio Fernández. Fernandez wrote the role of the pimp Paco for Acosta in the 1949 film \"Salón México\", for which Acosta earned a nomination as Best Supporting Actor at the 1950 Ariel Awards. He then was placed on contract by Universal Studios, beginning with a small role in \"One Way Street\" (1950). Although Acosta was considered a romantic screen idol in Mexico and South America, his burly body and strong features led to a long succession of roles as bandits, Native American warriors and outlaws in American films. In \"The Tijuana Story\" (1957), he had a sympathetic leading role, but in general he spent his career as a familiar western antagonist.\n\nAcosta was also a regular as Vaquero on NBC's \"The High Chaparral\" from 1967–1969. His other television appearances included \"Cheyenne\", \"Maverick\", \"Zorro\", \"Rawhide\" as Ossolo, an Indian Medicine Man in \"The Incident at Superstition Prairie\" in 1960, \"Bonanza\", and \"Daniel Boone\".\n\nIn 1959, Acosta played the Kiowa Chief Satanta in the third episode entitled \"Yellow Hair\" of the ABC western series \"The Rebel\", starring Nick Adams as a former Confederate soldier who wanders through the American West.\n\nAcosta was cast on \"Death Valley Days\" as Valdez, the traveling companion of Stephen F. Austin (David McLean), in the 1964 episode \"A Book of Spanish Grammar\", of the syndicated anthology series. In the story line, Austin travels to Mexico City to purchase land in colonial Texas to sell to future settlers. Valdez wonders why Austin risks so much to help strangers.\n\nAcosta married Jeanine Cohen in 1945 in Casablanca while he was in the military. In 1956, Cohen accused Acosta of adultery for sharing an apartment in Mexico City since 1953 with actress Ann Sheridan. Acosta subsequently filed for divorce in 1957. He then married Vera Martinez in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 18, 1971 and they divorced in October 1974.\n\nAcosta was the father of five children.\n\nOn November 7 1974, Acosta died of liver cancer at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, and was buried in Hollywood Hills at Forest Lawn Cemetery. \n\n\n"}

He was the professor at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law (1897—1940), Rector of the University of Belgrade (1913–14 and 1920–21), and the President of the Serbian Royal Academy (1928–1931). He took part at the Paris Peace Conference (1919) as an expert for the Yugoslav Government.\n\nJovanović was the Deputy Prime Minister (March 1941 - June 1942) and the Prime Minister of the Royal Yugoslav government-in-exile in London between January 1942 and June 1943. After the World War II, new Communist authorities of Yugoslavia sentenced him in absentia to 20 years in prison. Jovanović remained at liberty for the rest of his life in London.\n\nSlobodan Jovanović was born in Novi Sad, then part of Austria-Hungary (present-day Serbia) on 3 December 1869 to politician Vladimir Jovanović and his wife Jelena. He was reportedly the first Serbian male to be named \"Slobodan\" (\"sloboda\" means \"freedom\" in Serbian), while his sister was named Pravda (\"Justice\"). He received an excellent education in Belgrade, Munich, Zurich, and Geneva, where he graduated with a law degree. From 1890 to 1892, he took post-graduate studies in constitutional law and political science in Paris before entering the Serbian foreign service. In 1893 he was appointed political attaché with the Serbian mission to Constantinople, where he remained for a couple years. It was at this time that he began to write and have his articles on literary criticism published in various publications throughout the land. \n\nHe eventually left the diplomatic service in favour of academia and literary pursuits and became a contributing author and literary critic for several notable newspapers of the time. In 1897 he was appointed professor at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law. During the Balkan Wars and the First World War he was the Head of Serbian War Office Press Bureau. In this period Jovanović became acquainted with Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis and wrote positively of him.\n\nFor more than four decades, Jovanović taught at the law faculty gaining a reputation as an authority on constitutional law and Serbian language and literature. He was Rector of the University of Belgrade in two separate occasions and Dean of Faculty of Law. Jovanović joined the Serbian Royal Academy in 1908, and was its President from 1928 to 1931. He was also a correspondent member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb from 1927.\n\nSlobodan Jovanović was a critic of Hans Kelsen's Pure Theory of Law. His criticism was not simply dismissive however. His primary remarks are on the relation of Kelsen's theory to other German theorists at the time. He considered Kelsen an innovative \"young\" theorist, but thought that his framework was not as dissimilar to more classical theories that Kelsen, in Jovanović's opinion, tried to attack. Namely, Jovanović posited that the special position of the Basic norm for Kelsen could be reduced to the framework of more classical German theories, in which the state is a legal person from which the legal system originates, and vice versa. Jovanović considered this to be a flaw of Kelsen's Legal positivism that makes it a theory that does not truly address the origins of the law, as it fails to truly separate in analysis the legal system from the state as an actor. In this way, Jovanović rejects an analysis that would fully divorce the man as a legal creature, from man as a political one. \n\nJovanović had some influence on political life in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia due to his well established authority in the field of law and history, but he entered directly political life only in 1939 when the Serbian Cultural Club was established, and he was appointed as Club's president.\n\nHe was a pro-Western politician and when a pro-Western military coup took place in Belgrade on 27 March 1941, a pro-Western, essentially pro-British government was installed headed by General Dušan Simović. Jovanović was deputy Prime Minister in that government. The Third Reich attacked the Kingdoms of Yugoslavia and Greece on 6 April, and soon defeated Yugoslav and Greek forces. Jovanović moved in mid April together with King Peter II and other cabinet ministers to Jerusalem and he reached London in July. He became prime minister of the Yugoslav government-in-exile during World War II on 11 January 1942 and remained in that position until 26 June 1943. \n\nTried in absence in Josip Broz Tito's communist state together with general Draža Mihailović, he was sentenced to 20 years in jail which he never served, as well as the loss of political and civil rights for a period of ten years, and confiscation of all property and loss of citizenship. He spent his later years in exile in London (1945–1958). A memorial plaque in honour of \"Professor Slobodan Yovanovitch, Serbian historian, literary critic, legal scholar, Prime Minister of Yugoslavia\" may be found in London at 39b Queen's Gate Gardens, Kensington.\n\nAfter unofficial rehabilitation in 1989, his collected works were published in 1991.\n\nJovanović was decorated Order of Osmanieh and Order of Saint Sava.\n\nIn Serbia, he is regarded as one of the most influential political thinkers of the turn of the century. A number of his writings on a number of ideas such as Machiavellism and Platonist ideas of state are still relevant today. \n\nLeading Serbian journal Politika on the occasion of his 70th birthday concluded that \"his name has been carved as the highest peak of our culture up to now\".\n\nHis collected works were published in 17 volumes in 1939–1940. It contains the results of his unremitting labour as a writer, professor and politician for sixty years, and throws considerable light on Balkan history of the first half of the 20th century, as well as on the author himself. Although his works were not officially banned, any new issue of his books was not permitted in communist Yugoslavia until the late 1980s. Finally, a new edition of his collected works was published in Belgrade in 12 volumes in 1991. \n\nSince 2003 his portrait has appeared on the 5000 dinar banknote, and his bust stands at the Faculty of Law in Belgrade. His official rehabilitation occurred on 26 October 2007 by a Belgrade court. Since 10 December 2011, plateau in front of Faculty of Law in Belgrade bears his name.\n\n\n\n"}

Shortly after, Duane Melzer was hired as the first band director for the University, and he put together a small Pep Band of 13 players to play for football and basketball games. By the fall of 1994, the band had grown to 30 players and presented its first halftime field show. This was followed by their first performance in the New York City Columbus Day Parade and Saint Patrick's Day Parade.\n\nIn 1997, following Melzer's departure, the University appointed Marvin McNeill as the new Director of Bands. Under McNeill’s direction, the Pioneer Marching Band experienced steady growth, reaching a membership of 65. During this time, the band began to make appearances at local and regional Marching Band events, showing off their new uniform design. The band also made its first appearance at the Boston St. Patrick’s Day Parade. The band also made its first visit to an away football game, traveling to Pittsburgh when the team played against Robert Morris University. McNeill wrote the Pioneer Fight Song, which is still the Fight Song of SHU, and is played at football, basketball, and hockey games.\n\nIn 2002 McNeill left to take a position with the University of Connecticut Band program, at which time Charles Bennedum was appointed interim Director. In 2003, Keith Johnston was hired as the new Director of Bands, and Charles Bennedum was appointed Assistant Director.\n\nAs the band’s reputation grew, they received a number of offers to perform at various shows and competitions both in Connecticut and throughout the Northeast. In 2004 the Pioneer Marching Band made its first appearance at the Halloween Parade in NY’s Greenwich Village, performing for almost 2 million spectators. This was followed shortly thereafter by an appearance at the annual Thanksgiving Day Parade in Stamford, Connecticut. \n\nRecent media appearances by the band include a national television commercial for Verizon Wireless in 2004; an appearance on MTV in 2005; and an appearance in a national television commercial for Publisher’s Clearing House, also in 2005.\n\nThe Pioneer Marching Band has performed in Lancaster, Pennsylvania fat the Tournament of Bands, and at the Cavalcade of Bands PA Championship in Hershey. Additionally, the Marching Band makes regular appearances at Walt Disney World’s Magic Music Days parade at the Magic Kingdom.\n\nIn 2006 CSTV.com’s Rink Rat rated the Pioneer Pep Band better than Cornell’s “Big Red” band, especially praising the SHU band's varied repertoire, and performance of Soul Bossa Nova. The Pep Band performs at pep rallies, men’s and women’s basketball, men’s ice hockey and special events.\n\nThe University Concert Band performs music from the traditional wind band repertoire, as well as contemporary and modern works. The University Concert Band also commissions new works for band/wind ensemble. Membership is open to all students with a background in performing instrumental music who are enrolled at Sacred Heart University. A placement audition is required. The University Concert Band performs a Christmas Concert, and Spring Concert each year.\n\nThe Jazz Ensemble gives students the opportunity to develop their musical skills within the context of a variety of styles of jazz music. The Jazz Ensemble is often asked to perform for various events on-campus, and performs several concerts each year. \n\nSacred Heart University’s Winter Guard program, Terpsichore, performs at local and regional Musical Arts Conference (MAC) events, and regional and national Winter Guard International (WGI) events. Membership is open to any Sacred Heart University student.\n\nThe Pioneer Bands programs are supported by two organizations: the Band Council and the Lambda Nu chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi.\n\nThe Band Council is the official representative body for the Sacred Heart University band programs. The Band Council bridges the communication gap between the band directors and students. The Band Council organizes events at band camp each year, as well as the annual band banquet. They also fundraise for band activities such as the Band Banquet and a trip to Disney World every other year. \n\nKappa Kappa Psi is a National Honorary Band Fraternity that promotes excellence in college bands. The Lambda Nu chapter at Sacred Heart University was installed on May 21, 2005. The brotherhood currently has 24 active brothers, 6 honorary brothers and 48 alumni.\n\n"}

Operated by Cincinnati Public Schools, it houses grades seven through twelve. The school was established in 1895 and has occupied its current building since 1932.\n\nThe school was the third district public high school established in the city of Cincinnati, following Hughes H.S. and Woodward H.S., and was opened in September 1895 on the corner of Ashland and Burdett Avenues in Cincinnati. As a district high school, it accommodated the conventional four years (grades 9–12).\n\nIn 1919, Walnut Hills became a classical high school (college-preparatory school) and was expanded to accommodate six years (grades 7–12). Students were drawn from the entire city, rather than from a defined district within the city.\n\nA new building on Victory Boulevard (now Victory Parkway) was built on acquired from the Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati and completed in 1931. Designed by architect Frederick W. Garber's firm, it remains in use today. The facility was designed for 1700 students and included 31 class rooms, 3 study halls, choral harmony and band rooms, a general shop, a print shop, a mechanical drawing room, 2 swimming pools (separate swimming for boys and girls), a library, a large and a small auditorium, and a kitchen for teaching cooking (with pantry and adjacent living room and dining room).\n\nExamples of Cincinnati's famous Rookwood Pottery are to be found throughout the building, including the masks of comedy and tragedy adorning the proscenium arch of the large theatrical auditorium. The school's original Ashland and Burdett location became the Burdett School in 1932, which closed in 1979.\n\nFour temporary, prefabricated steel classrooms, called \"The Colony\" or \"the Tin Can\" by resentful students, were installed in 1958 to accommodate the increasing student population. As of the 2011–2012 school year, these have been demolished. In 1960, a one-story annex added 17 classrooms, including a language laboratory and typing lab, to the school. In 1976, a Fine Arts Complex was added, partially supplementing existing facilities near the main auditorium. In 1998, the Annex was razed and an Arts and Science Center containing 30 classrooms and state-of-the-art science labs replaced it in 1999. \n\nThe school opened a new stadium in September 2006 named after alumnus Robert S. Marx, who went on to become a judge in Michigan. In 2016, a new two-toned synthetic turf was installed.\n\nA comprehensive renovation project began in the 2010–2011 school year, and was completed for the 2014–2015 school year. The $56 million project funded by both Cincinnati Public Schools and the school's Alumni Foundation included a complete renovation of the original 1931 building, new music lyceum and athletic complex, including a new gym seating 1200 along 3 of the 4 walls, locker rooms, and a full size natatorium featuring a 25-meter, 6 lane pool. The new gym held its first game on November 30, 2012. \n\nA two-floor, 15 classroom foreign language wing was built, along with 4 outdoor courtyards around the school. The building remained open and in use, with 7 temporary modular buildings removed in 2013 to make way for the Christopher South Athletic Complex, which opened in October 2014. The complex features an all-weather synthetic turf field lined for football, soccer, and lacrosse, stands that seat 400, a press box, concessions, and batting cages. Six new hard-surface tennis courts opened in the spring of 2016.\n\nAll students must pass a standardized test in math and reading to be accepted to the school.\n\nWalnut Hills' Latin Club functions as a local chapter of both the Ohio Junior Classical League (OJCL) and National Junior Classical League (NJCL).\n\nThe sports teams have played in various regional leagues since the demise of the Public High School League in 1984. The 2012–2013 boys' basketball team finished the regular season 21–1, ranked #1 in Ohio and #18 in the country. They advanced to the Final Four in the tournament. The game was played at OSU's Schottenstein Center. They lost to Toledo Rogers.\n\n\nNotable alumni include:\n\n"}

Treviño, both revolutionary generals who had held important governmental positions. The foundation of the PARM was supported by President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, who saw a way to have an officially independent party that would support the efforts of the PRI and would give the appearance of democratic competition in elections and in Congress.\n\nFrom their founding to 1988, the PARM did not present their candidate to the presidency, instead backing the candidate of the PRI and supporting presidential proposals in Congress. It was only an independent competitor in one city, Nuevo Laredo, where it won the municipal presidency.\n\nIn 1988, the PARM broke from the PRI for the first time as it became the first party to nominate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas Solórzano for president, leading to the beginning of the National Democratic Front. However, after the elections ended, it refused to be a member of the new party formed by Cárdenas Solórzano with the Mexican Socialist Party and returned to its usual role as a satellite of the PRI.\n\nThe PARM lost its registry in 1994, but it briefly reappeared in 1999. The party nominated Porfirio Muñoz Ledo for president in 2000. One month prior to the election, the widening rift between the candidate and party leadership led to Muñoz Ledo resigning from his candidacy in favor of Vicente Fox. The party refused to recognize Muñoz Ledo's move but did not select a replacement candidate and definitively lost its registry in the ensuing election.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on May 19, 1999, by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records as a single from the soundtrack of the film, \"\". Madonna co-wrote and co-produced the song with William Orbit. The soundtrack for \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" was a much expected release and Madonna's song was chosen by the album's executive producers to promote it. \"Beautiful Stranger\" has appeared on two separate Madonna greatest hits collections: \"GHV2\" (2001) and \"Celebration\" (2009). Musically, \"Beautiful Stranger\" is a psychedelic pop and disco song that features heavily reverberated guitars and bouncy drum loops. Its lyrics tell the tale of a romantic infatuation.\n\nThe song received positive feedback from music critics who praised the production and Madonna's progress with her music, following her critically acclaimed album \"Ray of Light\" (1998). It was a commercial success reaching the top of the charts in Canada, Finland, Iceland and Italy, number two in the United Kingdom and top-ten in many markets. Although the song was not commercially released in the United States, it reached number 19 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 due to airplay. It reached number one on the US dance charts. \"Beautiful Stranger\" also earned Madonna her fifth Grammy Award, winning the trophy for Best Song Written for Visual Media.\n\nThe song's music video, directed by Brett Ratner, prominently features Madonna singing in a club, visited by Mike Myers as the character Austin Powers. At the end of the video Madonna seduces Myers and goes off in his car. It won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film in 1999. Madonna performed the song on her 2001 Drowned World Tour, and it has been covered by some artists, including a critically acclaimed version by Australian rock band DMA's.\n\nMadonna and Canadian actor Mike Myers had previously collaborated for an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1991, when the singer hosted the show and invited Myers' character, Wayne Campbell to play a game of truth or dare, while pitching her documentary \"\". According to Gwen Ihnat from \"The A.V. Club\", the \"creative partnership [between them] works because Madonna, though serious, always seems game, and Myers, though frequently goofy, is also creatively inventive\". In 1999, the singer was chosen to contribute a single on the soundtrack for Myers' second film about the spy character Austin Powers, titled \"\".\n\nThe soundtrack to \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" led to the teaming up of two music executives, Warner Bros. Records senior vice president Danny Bramson and Madonna's Maverick Records' co-owner Guy Oseary; both of them served as executive producer on the soundtrack. By May 1999, expectations were already high for the release, so the producers decided to include Madonna's track along with a song from a number of other high-profile artists like R.E.M., Lenny Kravitz and Mel B from the Spice Girls.\n\nAs recalled by Oseary, there was intense competition among artists to have their songs placed in the soundtrack, with one manager connected to the project describing the fight for the first potential single release as \"a blood bath\". The main intention of the producers was to have the artists contribute music which would abide by the predominant 1960s mood of the film. Ultimately it was decided that \"Beautiful Stranger\" was suitable for this, and was chosen as the first single from the soundtrack. However, Madonna's recording company Warner Bros. decided not to release any CD single or remix singles to accompany the release in the United States, only promo 12\" discs were sent to the dance club DJs. The song was only released to the CHR top 40 radio for airplay on May 19, 1999. \"Beautiful Stranger\" has appeared on two separate Madonna greatest hits collections: \"GHV2\" (2001) and \"Celebration\" (2009).\n\nRecording for \"Beautiful Stranger\" took place at February 1999 at the Guerilla Beach Studios in Los Angeles, California, as well as the Enterprise Studio in Burbank, California. Along with writing and producing the song with Madonna, Orbit also played the keyboards and the guitar on the track. Damian LeGassick did the programming and additional keyboard while Emma Fowler played the flute. The engineering team included Pat McCarthy, Mark Endert and Dave Chelsea, with McCarthy also mixing the track. Jeff Gregmay and Wassim Zartek were the assistant recording engineers. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, \"Beautiful Stranger\" is set in common time and is composed in a key of F major with a mid dance tempo of 128 beats per minute. The song begins with a basic sequence of E–B–F–A–C before moving to the main chord progression of C–C.\n\n\"Beautiful Stranger\" is a psychedelic pop and disco song and begins with a musical instrumentation reminiscent of \"Light My Fire\" (1967) by The Doors and \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" (1967) by The Beatles. The song's main structure is backed by guitar, while drums come in during the choruses. Around the 1:06 mark, there is a hint of mellotron and flute being played like The Beatles' 1967 songs \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" or \"The Fool on the Hill\". The song has similar composition to Madonna's endeavors with her previous album \"Ray of Light\", mixed with psychedelic music. \"USA Today\"s Ken Barnes has suggested that the chorus, riff, instrumentation and structure of \"Beautiful Stranger\" were based on American rock band Love's 1966 single \"She Comes in Colors\". The band's record company—Rhino Records—executive Gary Stewart stated that \"Certainly, the riff and instrumentation [of 'Beautiful Stranger'] are reminiscent of 'She Comes in Colors,'\" and that the \"da da da da da\" chorus on the track seems to be based upon \"an instrumental flourish that's an integral part of the [Love] record. It may be a conscious or an unconscious homage.\" Madonna denied any such influence, claiming that she had never heard of Love.\n\nAccording to Michael Paoletta from \"Billboard\", \"no fierce-ruling club DJ in 1999 would [have] dared play the original jangly rock-etched version of the song\". Hence the song was remixed by Victor Calderone, who kept the basic structure of the song, while mixing it with tribal infused beats. Unlike many of his then releases—where he removed the bulk of the song's lyrics for remixing—with \"Beautiful Stranger\" he kept them. Paoletta described the remixes as \"if Calderone fully understands the importance of a song and understands how best to unite deft beats and a dazzling vocal performance.\" The remixes include a rock-leaning version as well as Calderone's Club and Radio mixes.\n\n\"Beautiful Stranger\" received generally positive reviews. Chuck Taylor from \"Billboard\" denoted the song as a \"new shift in the wind for [Madonna]\", calling it another creative high for her. He also complimented the production saying that \"this latest partnership with [Orbit] taps into a walloping romp of guitars and\nenough cascading organs to prompt an urge to listen to your Monkees collection.\" Taylor ended the review with positive feedback for Madonna's vocals, likening them to those for the \"Evita\" album, along with commending the chorus. In a different article for \"Billboard\" talking about the song's remixes, Paoletta described the track as \"effervescent blast of psychedelic electronica\". Writing for the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\", Gino DeLa Paz found it \"cute but forgettable\". Gwen Ihnat, from the entertainment website \"The A.V. Club\", labeled it as \"Madonna's best song that never appeared on one of her regular albums [...] a psychedelic pop confection that offered a few of her most indelible hooks\". Ihnat also wrote that \"although less ethereal than 1998's \"Ray of Light\", ['Beautiful Stranger'] is just as dance-floor ready [...] dance flute has never sounded so enticing, and Madonna's voice so sweetly seductive\". AllMusic's Jose F. Promis listed the track \"as one of the singer's more memorable moments, coupling 1960s go-go rock with 1990s electronica, resulting in nothing less than a true slice of old fashioned rock & roll\"; Promis also praised the two Calderone mixes.\n\n\"Slant Magazine\"s Sal Cinquemani gave the song a rating of B- and wrote: \"Like any good throwaway track, 'Beautiful Stranger' doesn't pretend to be much more than it is. Whiny guitars and flutes abound, Madonna and Orbit concocted a perfect theme song for friend Mike Myers's cooky \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\". Playful, wispy and ultimately forgettable\". In August 2018, Paul Schrodt from the same magazine, placed it at number 53 on his raking of the singer's singles, calling it \"the antithesis of \"Ray of Light\". The hooky, psychedelic track is more accessible than Madonna’s previous work with Orbit. The innocuous lyrics could’ve been ghostwritten for anyone, but the song endears due to Madge’s playful delivery and Orbit’s sonic details\". Ken Tucker from \"Entertainment Weekly\", declared it as the \"song of the summer\", and praised it for being \"a piece of psychedelic pop at once so 60s and so 90s that to sully it with a 'shagalicious' joke would be an insult... The way [Madonna] has of making her voice merge into indistinguishability with the surging instrumentation in the chorus, the way she sings the title phrase with an ache in her voice, that's at once urgent and playful.\" Matthew Jacobs from \"The Huffington Post\" ranked the song 22 on their list of \"The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles\". Medium's Richard LaBeau called it a \"bold, clever and interesting bridge between the \"Ray of Light\" and \"Music\" eras\".\n\nLouis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed \"Beautiful Stranger\" at number 36 of his list \"The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs\"; he felt that \"Orbit's psychedelic styling suit Madonna's groovy wistfulness perfectly\". Author Phil Dellio wrote in his book \"Interrupting My Train of Thought\" that although \"Beautiful Stranger\" had similarities to Madonna's own \"Ray of Light\" (1998), it had \"better melody, better vocal, better light show. It's about the trippiest, most propulsive above-ground dance music since the first two minutes of Led Zeppelin's 'How Many More Times'.\" J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in \"\" that Madonna's 2000 song \"Amazing\", from her eight studio album \"Music\" sounded like a cousin to \"Beautiful Stranger\" with its inspired composition. While ranking Madonna's singles, in honor of her 60th birthday, \"The Guardian\"s Jude Rogers placed \"Beautiful Stranger\" at number 34, calling it a \"gorgeously slinky, impish love song\". In a list of the \"99 Best Songs of 1999\", \"Rolling Stone\" writer Rob Sheffield placed the track at number 27 and praised it for being \"the most shagadelic disco hit by a megastar shimmying into the big 4-0\", adding that \"Madonna has never sounded so loose, so lithe, so funny\". The song received a Grammy award at the 42nd ceremony, in the category of Best Song Written for Visual Media. It was also nominated in the category of Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song, but lost to Phil Collinss \"You'll Be in My Heart\". At the 2000 ASCAP Pop Awards it was awarded the Most Performed Song. It also won the Ivor Novello Award for Most Performed Work, while also being nominated for Best Contemporary Song. The 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards also nominated the track in the category of Best Song. \"Beautiful Stranger\" was nominated as Favorite Song From a Movie at the 1999 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nIn the United States, \"Beautiful Stranger\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 78 on June 12, 1999. It was Madonna's first soundtrack single to chart on the Hot 100 since her rendition of \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" reached number eight in March 1997. \"Beautiful Stranger\" also debuted at number 28 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart. It gradually climbed up the Hot 100 and peaked at number 19 on July 13, 1999, on the strength of radio airplay only. Promis said that the relative low placement was due to the CD singles not being released. \"Beautiful Stranger\" was successful on the \"Billboard\" dance charts, reaching number one on the Dance Club Songs chart. It placed at number 31 on the year-end ranking for Dance Club Songs in 1999. In Canada, \"Beautiful Stranger\" was able to top both the \"RPM\" Top Singles and Adult Contemporary charts, while also reaching a peak of number four on the Dance/Urban charts.\n\nIn Australia, \"Beautiful Stranger\" debuted at number eight on the ARIA Charts, and reached its peak of number five the next week, staying there for two weeks in total. It gradually descended down the charts, present within the top 50 for a total of 16 weeks. It was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 35,000 copies of the single. At the year end tabulation, the song ranked at number 34 on the Singles chart. In New Zealand, \"Beautiful Stranger\" debuted at its peak position of number five. The single gradually descended down the charts, and was present for a total of 14 weeks.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the song debuted at its peak of number two on the UK Singles Chart, being kept from the top spot by S Club 7's \"Bring It All Back\". The song spent 16 weeks on the singles chart, with seven of those being within the top 20. \"Beautiful Stranger\" also became one of the most played songs on UK radio, receiving over 2,462 plays per week, breaking the previous record held by Cher with her single \"Believe\". According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold 534,800 copies in the United Kingdom as of August 2016 and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Across Europe, \"Beautiful Stranger\" reached the top twenty of the charts in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, while reaching the top of the charts in Finland and Italy. It received a silver certification in France for shipment of 125,000 copies. The song reached a peak of number two on the European Hot 100 Singles chart, also ranking number two in the 1999 year-end tabulation behind Britney Spears' \"...Baby One More Time\".\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Brett Ratner. Madonna had previously shown interest in working with Ratner due to his work on D'Angelo's video for \"Brown Sugar\" (1995). Her make-up was done by Kevyn Aucoin, with whom she had previously worked on her music video for \"The Power of Good-Bye\". Filming for the video took place at the Universal Studios in Los Angeles around May 1999. According to Ratner, it was a rather jovial shooting:\n\nMike was in character the entire time. He and Madonna really had a great chemistry together. This video shows her absolutely hysterical sense of humour, and it's great for everyone to see that side of her. This was by far the most fun I've ever had making a video.\n\nThe video begins with Myers as Austin Powers, receiving a call from his boss Basil Exposition (Michael York) who warns him against a dangerous spy describing her as a \"master of disguise\". The screen of his car depicts five images of Madonna wearing different looks, and Exposition clarifies that she has been \"seducing our top agents\". He also warns Powers \"whatever you do don't fall in love. We've already lost 007 and 008\". As the video continues, Powers finds Madonna at a club performing in front of a crowd, which includes Verne Troyer in character as Mini-Me. As he watches her perform Powers finds himself fantasizing about the two of them dancing in front of a white background with psychedelic fluorescent whirls. He also visualizes them riding a car together, where Madonna dances suggestively and licks Powers' face while rubbing her crotch and bottom on his cheeks.\n\nAccording to Ratner, Myers was not comfortable with these scenes, as he felt it was too sexual and inappropriate; he even asked him to cut that particular shot. Madonna on the other hand, thought it was fun and convinced the director to keep it. The video ends with one of Powers' fantasies, him proclaiming \"It's good to be me!\" as Madonna playfully strokes his cheek. Author Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in his book, \"Madonna as Postmodern Myth\", that \"Beautiful Stranger\" denoted one of the series of looks reinvented by Madonna around that time, and was a \"radical\" change from the geisha look of her previous video for \"Nothing Really Matters\", released the same year. Matthew Rettenmund wrote in his \"Encyclopedia Madonnica\" that \"Madonna probably gave very little thought [behind the video]\" but he felt that it was better than being a \"couple of steps above a clips compilation\".\n\nAt the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated in the categories of Best Female Video and Best Cinematography, and won for Best Video from a Film. It also received a nomination for Best Pop Clip of the Year at the 1999 Billboard Music Video Awards. The clip won Best Cinematography and Best Make-Up at the 2000 MVPA Awards; it was also nominated for Soundtrack Video of the Year. At the 1999 VH1 Fashion Awards, the video received a nomination in the category of Most Stylish Video. The video can be found on the Madonna compilations, \"\" (1999) and \"\" (2009).\n\nMadonna performed \"Beautiful Stranger\" on her 2001 Drowned World Tour, where it was the fourth song on the setlist. It began with an introduction by Myers as Austin Powers on the video screens, the singer then asked the crowd \"Do I make you horny?\" (one of Powers' catchphrases) before performing the song. She was joined by backup singers Niki Haris and Donna DeLory, who also contributed with background vocals on the track. Costumes for the performance included spiked dog collars, Swarovski crystal-encrusted bracelets and tattered tops; Madonna herself wore a sleeveless black top, crossover top with one net sleeve, jeans with zips and bondage straps and a tartan kilt. The backdrop during the performance displayed scenes from the movie and psychedelic fluorescent whirls. It also featured a lost technician at the end and elements of \"Soul Bossa Nova (Dim's Space-A-Nova)\", another song from the film's soundtrack. On September 15, 2001, the tour's final date, Madonna's then husband Guy Ritchie joined her onstage as the lost technician. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH noted that \"things quickly hotted up with [...] 'Beautiful Stranger'\". The performance on August 26, 2001, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, outside of Madonna's hometown of Detroit was recorded and released in the live video album, \"Drowned World Tour 2001\".\n\nOn October 26, 2008, Madonna performed a snippet of \"Beautiful Stranger\" as the request song during the Chicago stop of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. An a cappella version of the song was also performed during the Nashville stop of her Rebel Heart Tour in January 2016. In December 2016, Madonna performed \"Beautiful Stranger\" during her show as part of a benefit dinner for her charity, Raising Malawi, at Miami, Florida.\n\nJon Auer, co-founder of the American power pop band The Posies, recorded a cover of the song on his 2001 solo EP \"6 ½\". Website Stereogum listed the cover at number five on their list of The 20 Best Indie Rock Madonna Covers. A 2007 folk music tribute compilation to Madonna, entitled \"Through the Wilderness\", features a cover of the song by Golden Animals. Australian rock band DMA's covered the song during their BBC Radio 1 sessions with Annie Mac on March 8, 2016. Michelle Geslani from Consequence of Sound website praised the cover saying that it would \"undoubtedly be hailed as yet another successful entry in DMA's young career\" and described the cover as \"easily tweaking the swirling, retro number into a psychedelic, arena-ready anthem\". Michael Carr from \"Music Feeds\" magazine also praised the cover saying \"Lending itself surprisingly well to the boys’ shoegazey brit pop treatment, the lads absolutely nail it... To be honest though, they kind of won on song choice alone\".\n\nMost recently, American punk band Skating Polly released a cover of the song on the 2020 re-release of their album, The Make It All Show, as one of the bonus tracks. The band had previously covered the song on their 2016 tour.\n\n\n\n\nCredits and personnel adapted from \"Beautiful Stranger\" promo single liner notes.\n\n"}

He was notable for his debut novel, \"Lalsalu\" (translated in English with the title \"\"Tree Without Roots\"\"). He was awarded Bangla Academy Literary Award (1961), Adamjee Prize (1965), Ekushey Padak (1984) and Bangladesh National Film for Best Story (2001).\n\nWaliullah was born on 15 August 1922 at Sholashahar in Chittagong District to Nasim Ara Khatun and Syed Ahmadullah. His mother died when he was twelve. He has an elder brother, Syed Nasrullah. His father, Syed Ahmadullah, was a government officer. He was a district magistrate of British Raj period. Waliullah spent his childhood in Mymensingh, Feni, Krishnanagar and Kurigram. His notable novel, \"Lalsalu\", was inspired by a shrine covered with red cloth that he would often pass when he lived in Mymensingh.\n\nWaliullah passed his matriculation examination in 1939 from Kurigram High School. He completed his IA from Dhaka Intermediate College in 1941and bachelor's from Ananda Mohan College in Mymensingh in 1943. He then moved to Calcutta to complete his master's in economics. But he couldn't complete his master's due to untimely demise of his father. He joined \"The Statesman\" newspaper and worked until 1947.\n\nIn 1947, Waliullah moved from Calcutta to Dhaka. He joined Radio Pakistan. In 1950, he was transferred to Karachi. In 1951, he started serving as the press attaché at the Pakistan missions in New Delhi, Sydney, Jakarta and London. In 1960, he was appointed as the First Secretary at the Pakistan embassy in Paris. In 1967, he joined the UNESCO in Paris.\n\nWaliullah is often considered the pioneer of existential analysis of the characters psyche in the literature of Bangladesh. The last two of his three novels, especially ' \"Kando Nadi Kando (Cry, o river)\", (\"কাঁদো নদী কাঁদো') (1968)\", show his mastery in revealing the inner depths of his characters. \" Chander Amaboshay (Dark moon)\" (\" চাঁদের অমাবস্যা \"), (1964) was another famous novel of him.\" Nayanchara\"(\"নয়নচারা\"), (1946) and \" Dui Tir O Anyanya Galpa\"(\"দুই তীর এবং অন্যান্য গল্প\"), (1965)\" are storybooks written by him.\n\n\"Lalsalu\" tells the story of Majid, a poor man from a devout Muslim background. Majid comes to a remote village. He declares an old grave to be the \"Mazar\" that of a \"Pir\", covers it with the traditional red cloth used for mausoleums, and establishes his stronghold on the life of the people using the reflected power on him of the supposed saint. The novel shows his struggle with other religious figures trying to establish dominance, the undercurrent of pagan ideas among the people, and his own weaknesses.\n\nThe novel was adapted to a Tanvir Mokammel film with the same title in 2001.\n\nWaliullah met Anne Marie Thibaud (1929–1997), a French woman, in Sydney. They were married in 1955 and had two children, Simine and Iraj. He was a cousin of Jamal Nazrul Islam, a physicist and mathematician.\n\nWaliullah died in Meudon in Paris on October 10, 1971.\n\n\n\n"}

Regular service between Canton and Kowloon began on 1 October 1910.\n\nThe new station was designed by Arthur Benison Hubback and built on reclaimed land overlooking the harbour. Work on the foundations started in May, 1913, and the construction of the station began on 1 March 1914. It was completed on 1 March 1916, and the station was officially opened on 28 March 1916.\n\nThe building consisted of a two-storey L shaped terminal building with a clock tower. It was designed in a Edwardian Classical Revival style, and built had a steel frame with red brick cladding as well as white granite columns, architraves and pediments. On the north end of the station was a covered walkway which led to two covered elevated platforms. A freight station was located a mile north of the station.\n\nOwing to lacking of space for expansion, the southern terminus of the railway was moved from Tsim Sha Tsui to a new station of the same name on the new reclaimed land from Hung Hom Bay in 1974. The Hong Kong Cultural Centre was constructed on the site. The new Kowloon Station was renamed to its present name, Hung Hom, in the late 1990s.\n\nAfter its relocation to Hung Hom (also replacing the old Hung Hom station) in 1974, and until 1994, \"Kowloon\" had been the name of present-day Hung Hom Station, the new southern terminus of the KCR, the railway which was renamed KCR East Rail in the late 1990s.\n\nA campaign was mounted to preserve the 60-year-old red brick terminus. The Kowloon Residents' Association wrote to the Colonial Secretary in 1970; the Tsim Sha Tsui Neighbourhood and Welfare Association also wrote to the Colonial Secretary in 1975, and again in May 1977.\n\nA petition was mounted by the Heritage Society, and sent to the then Governor, Murray MacLehose on 29 July 1977. The Government rejected the petition, and its request for an independent inquiry into the draft area development plan. It argued that a new cultural complex would assume the role enjoyed by the building, and that the plans for a new cultural complex to be erected on the site were too far advanced to be altered. The Heritage society charged that the Government was engaged in dirty tricks, and was misleading the public.\n\nThe Heritage Society escalated lobbying effort, and petitioned Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\n\nThe Clock Tower is the only part of the old station in Tsim Sha Tsui remaining at its own site. Six pillars of the station building were moved to the Urban Council Centenary Garden in Tsim Sha Tsui East. After decades at other locations, including the East Rail depot at Ho Tung Lau, the clock tower's bell was returned to its original home in September 2010.\n\n\n"}

She served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1932, as a member of the Manitoba Liberal Party. She was the first woman ever elected to the legislature.\n\nEdith Florence McTavish was born at Norway House, Manitoba on 26 April 1876, the daughter of Lydia Catherine Christie (Métis) and Donald C. McTavish (Métis), Chief Factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company. Edith’s mother Lydia Christie was the daughter of William Christie (Métis) and Mary Sinclair (Métis). Rogers, had strong family connections to Manitoba's past. Her maternal great-grandfather, Alexander Christie, served as Governor of Assiniboia on two occasions, and supervised the construction of Fort Garry. His son, William J. Christie, worked for the Hudson's Bay Company in Manitoba from 1843 to 1873, and was named Inspecting Chief Factor in 1868. Rogers herself was born in the tiny outpost of Norway House, six hundred kilometres north of Winnipeg, the daughter of Donald MacTavish, a chief factor for the Hudson's Bay Company. At age two, she moved with her family to Rupert House, on the shore of James Bay.\n\nShe was educated in Montreal. After graduation, she moved to Winnipeg and, in 1898, married the businessman Robert Arthur Rogers. She became prominent as a philanthropist in the 1910s, and particularly after the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Rogers worked for the Patriotic Fund, which distributed money to the families of soldiers fighting overseas, and became known for devoting several hours to personal consultations with family members. She also worked with the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, the Land Settlement Board and other groups.\n\nIn 1916, Manitoba's Liberal government of Tobias Norris passed a law extending voting rights to women. In 1920, Rogers was asked to become a \"star candidate\" for the Liberal Party in the Winnipeg constituency, which elected ten members by a single transferable ballot. She accepted, contested the 1920 provincial election, finished eighth on the first count, and was declared elected on the thirty-eighth count.\n\nFor the next two years, Rogers served as a backbench supporter of Norris's administration. Because of her work with Winnipeg's returned soldiers and unemployed men, she was more sympathetic to labour issues than were most others in the Liberal caucus. She played a significant role in steering Manitoba's Child Welfare Act through committee and into law. She also supported the prohibition of alcohol.\n\nThe Liberals were defeated by the United Farmers of Manitoba in the 1922 provincial election. Rogers, who was re-elected in Winnipeg, served with seven other Liberals on the opposition benches. She frequently criticised social service cuts enacted by John Bracken's administration.\n\nRogers was re-elected for a final time in the 1927 election, which the Liberals again lost. In 1928, she represented Canada at the Geneva Conference for the abolition of import and export prohibitions and restrictions. Her husband died in 1929, and she did not seek re-election in 1932.\n\nShe resumed her philanthropic career in World War II, serving as chair of the Provincial War Council of the Red Cross. She retired in 1942, and died in Colborne, Ontario five years later.\n\nRogers's daughter, Margaret Konantz, served as a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1963 to 1965, and was the first woman ever elected as a federal MP from Manitoba.\n\nGail Konantz wrote a biography of Rogers in 1981.\n"}

It was an expansion to nationwide applicability of a 1947 law previously restricted only to the District of Columbia (\"See\" 61 Stat. 642).\n\nIn 1989, the 101st Congress amended that statute with Public Law 101-131 (103 Stat. 777). These amendments to the statute were in response to the United States Supreme Court's ruling that year in the case of \"Texas v. Johnson\" (491 U.S. 397). On June 11, 1990, the Supreme Court in the case of \"United States v.

{"id": "2241977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241977", "title": "Kirk Fell", "text": "Kirk Fell\n\nKirk Fell is a fell in the Western part of the English Lake District. It is situated between Great Gable and Pillar on the long ring of fells surrounding the valley of Ennerdale, and also stands over Wasdale to the south. However, it is separated from its two higher neighbours by the low passes of Black Sail and Beck Head, giving it a high relative height and making it a Marilyn, the thirteenth highest in the Lake District.\n\nThe direct ascent up the south-western slope from Wasdale Head is exceptionally steep and the subject of an amusing drawing by Wainwright. Usual ascents are by one of the aforementioned passes; alternatively one may climb Kirk Fell as part of the Mosedale Horseshoe, a walk on the fells surrounding Mosedale, a side-valley of Wasdale.\n\nThe Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north-east and Wasdale to the south-east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley. Kirk Fell is the first on the southern arm.\n\nThe main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. The main fells in this section are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell, followed by the lower Lank Rigg group. \n\nKirk Fell sits squarely at the head of Wasdale, rising between the main headstreams of Mosedale and Lingmell Becks. From this direction it appears as a truncated cone, steep sided with a wide level top. The flanks above Wasdale are unremittingly steep, of grass and scree with little to break the monotony. The only stream on these slopes is Ill Gill, falling from the depression between the summit and the east top.\n\nTo the west, between Kirk Fell and Pillar, is Black Sail Pass. This is a pedestrian route from Wasdale to Ennerdale, and from there onward via Scarth Gap to Buttermere. A well-graded path now used exclusively for leisure, it was once a thoroughfare for trade between the valleys. The summit of the pass at is crossed by the Ennerdale Fence, a boundary marking the watershed around the head of the valley. Although some sections of the 'fence' are actually stone walls, that running over the top of Kirk Fell is only a remnant, marked by occasional posts.\n\nThe Ennerdale face of Kirk Fell has more features to offer, but due to the remoteness of the dalehead is much less familiar. A wall of rock rims the summit plateau, Boat How Crags to the east and Kirkfell Crags to the west. Between the two is the hollow of Baysoar Slack, the birthplace of Sail Beck. Below the crags the gradient is not quite as severe as on the Wasdale side, slopes running down to the bank of the River Liza. Kirk Fell does not have such a prominent position in Ennerdale, Great Gable standing at the head of the valley.\n\nTo the east of Kirk Fell is Beck Head (2,020 ft), the col connecting to Great Gable. A small rocky spur, Rib End, runs down from the summit plateau to the tarns at the depression. Although prominently named on Ordnance Survey maps, Beckhead Tarn is a small shallow pool with a bed of peat and submerged flags. A second smaller pool forms after heavy rain.\n\nThe summit plateau of Kirk Fell assumes a 'figure of eight' shape in plan, the narrow waist squeezed between Illgill Head and Baysoar Slack. The highest ground is to the west, while a subsidiary top occupies the other section. Kirk Fell East Top has sufficient prominence (34 m, 112 ft) to qualify as a Hewitt in its own right. Between the summits is Kirkfell Tarn, actually two small tarns. The deeper pool is an oval, while the other has an indented outline, reminiscent of Sprinkling Tarn on Seathwaite Fell in miniature.\n\nThe summit area consists of drift deposits overlying the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas and subordinate sills of the Birker Fell Formation. The northern crags expose some granophyric granite of the Ennerdale Intrusion, together with the bedded breccias, sandstones and tuffs of the Round How Member.\n\nThe main top is marked by a cairn set amid an area of stones. The east top has a cairn set on a rocky outcrop. Some remains of the old fence can be found on the watershed, crossing both tops.\n\nGreat Gable fills the eastern view, Gable Crag and the Napes seen in fascinating profile. Across Wasdale rise the Scafells, while the High Stile and Grasmoor ranges are well seen in the other direction. There are also more distant glimpses of the Skiddaw and Helvellyn ranges.\n\nA path of sorts ascends direct from the village of Wasdale Head to the summit, the way being in Wainwright's words \"a relentless and unremitting treadmill, a turf clutching crawl, not a walk. There are only three opportunities of standing upright…\". More conventional ascents can be made via Black Sail or Beck Head, the former providing easier gradients. Black Sail can also be used to give access from Ennerdale, although unless staying at Black Sail Youth Hostel, the nearest access in this direction is actually Gatesgarth via Scarth Gap.\n\nKirk Fell can also be climbed as part of the Mosedale Horseshoe, also taking in Yewbarrow, Red Pike, Scoat Fell and Pillar.\n"}
{"id": "2241987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241987", "title": "Eddie Clarke (musician)", "text": "Eddie Clarke (musician)\n\nEdward Allan Clarke (5 October 1950 – 10 January 2018), better known as \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, was a British guitarist who was a member of heavy metal bands Fastway and Motörhead. Of Motörhead's classic lineup, which consisted of Lemmy, himself and Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor, he was the last surviving member.\n\nClarke began playing guitar and, by the time he was fifteen years old, had been through many local bands, one of which was called The Bitter End. Of his \"Fast\" moniker, Clarke has said \"I didn't get the name Fast Eddie because of any sex thing, and it wasn't even because I could play fast. It was just that I could play one note in solo really fast.\"\n\nHe continued playing local gigs until 1973, when he turned professional by joining Curtis Knight's blues prog rock band, Zeus, as lead guitarist. In 1974, the band recorded an album called \"The Second Coming\" at Olympic Studios. Clarke wrote the music to Knight's lyrics on a track entitled \"The Confession\".\n\nClarke recorded the album \"Sea of Time\" with Zeus. Later, with guitarist friend Allan Callan, keyboard player Nicky Hogarth, and drummer Chris Perry, Clarke attended a recorded jam session at Command Studios in Piccadilly. As a result of the tracks from this session, the quartet secured a deal with Anchor Records, and called the band Blue Goose. With a recording contract secured, Clarke, Hogarth and Perry left Zeus to focus on their own project with Callan.\n\nClarke soon formed another band with Be-Bop Deluxe bassist Charlie Tumahai vocalist Ann McCluskie, and Jim Thompson on drums. Called Continuous Performance, this line up lasted until early 1975, when their demo tracks failed to secure them a record deal and the band split up. Still out to secure a record deal, Clarke then formed a group with Nicky Hogarth from Blue Goose, bass player Tony Cussons and drummer Terry Slater. Their efforts to get a deal were also unsuccessful, and Clarke temporarily gave up the music industry.\n\nClarke was working on re-fitting a houseboat, when he met drummer Phil Taylor, \nwho had recently joined Motörhead. However, according to Kilmister's authorized biography , it appears that Clarke was introduced to Lemmy by a receptionist at the rehearsal studio, Gertie, who was romantically involved with Clarke at the time. Not long after, he was playing with them. In the early days Eddie rehearsed with Motörhead, before going on the road, at Snobs Rehearsal Studios, part of a converted brewery on the corner of Kings Road and Lots Road, Chelsea, known as the \"Furniture Cave\". Motörhead's popularity increased along with their UK chart successes. The threesome (Lemmy, Clarke, Taylor) are considered the classic Motörhead line-up and have the \"Motörhead, Overkill, Ace of Spades, Bomber, No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\" and \"Iron Fist\" albums plus a string of hit singles to their credit.\n\nHe performed a lead vocal on five Motörhead songs: \"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\" (on which he traded vocals with Lemmy), \"I'm Your Witchdoctor\" (on which he duets vocals with Lemmy), \"Step Down\", and \"Emergency\", one of the B-side tracks on the \"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\" EP, upon which they performed \"Please Don't Touch\", with Girlschool, under the combined band names of Headgirl.\n\nClarke left Motörhead in 1982, whilst on tour of the United States. Becoming unhappy at the results of the \"Iron Fist\" album, the recording sessions with the Plasmatics were the final straw. For the B-side of the \"Stand By Your Man EP\" the bands took turns in covering each other's songs, Clarke felt that this compromised the band's principles and resigned. According to Joel McIver, Clarke himself later denied this version of events and had said: \"[Philthy] was the main instigator in my being excluded from the band. Notice I do not call it leaving, as it was not my choice. I had imagined dying onstage with Motörhead, so it was a blow when they didn’t want me in the band any longer.\" Clarke was replaced by former Thin Lizzy and Wild Horses lead guitarist Brian Robertson after Anvil frontman Steve \"Lips\" Kudlow turned down the offer to play with Motörhead. Clarke's last gig with Motörhead took place at the New York Palladium on 14 May 1982. Another cameo from Clarke on a later Motörhead album was on 2000's \"Live at Brixton Academy\", released in 2003, on which the band featured many guest appearances from other guitarists, of which he was one, playing on the songs \"No Class\", \"The Chase Is Better Than the Catch\" and \"Overkill\".\n\nHearing that UFO bassist Pete Way was keen to leave that band, the two met and decided their new band's name would be an amalgamation of their own two names, resulting in Fastway. They advertised in the music press for a drummer and a vocalist. Meanwhile a rehearsal was organised, for which Clash drummer Topper Headon filled in on drums. The ads began showing positive results, cassettes from potential band members arrived; one of these was from a young singer named Dave King. \n\nClarke was impressed with his voice and financed a trip to London for King; after an audition together, King became the Fastway vocalist. Ex-Humble Pie member Jerry Shirley became the drummer. The band sent out demo tapes and were approached by CBS Records for a recording deal. Way announced his departure just as they were about to sign the deal, but CBS had faith in Fastway and decided to sign them despite this setback.\n\nTouring had been strenuous for the band and, upon returning to Britain, they decided to split. Clarke stayed in London, and soon received a call from King about giving Fastway another go. Clarke agreed and moved to Ireland. With another album for CBS in view, they rehearsed with three of King's friends. The record label was happy with the sound and had them record at London's Abbey Road Studios with producer Terry Manning, releasing \"Waiting for the Roar\" in 1986. Clarke toured America with Fastway, supporting AC/DC, followed by a lengthy European tour, which produced 1992's \"Say What You Will – Live\" album. Fastway were also engaged to provide music for the \"Trick Or Treat\" film soundtrack, for which they composed the title track and performed \"Heft\" and \"If You Could See\" from their albums.\n\nAfter the band split up again, Clarke moved back to London and met up with Lea Hart, a solo artist in the Far East. Clarke's record deals had now expired, so the pair took a demo tape to Douglas Smith (Clarke's former Motörhead manager) at GWR Records, who willingly signed a deal. Still using the name Fastway, they recorded the \"On Target\" album. It featured Don Airey and Paul Airey on keyboards, Neil Murray on bass, plus Bram Tchaikovsky of The Motors and Christine Byford as backing vocalists.\n\nClarke's group now consisted of Riff Raff on drums, keyboards and bass, plus assorted friends helping out; Biff Byford and Nigel Glockler of Saxon, Don Airey, and Kim McAuliffe and Cris Bonacci of Girlschool. Following the production of two albums, Clarke and Hart split up.\n\nHowever, the excesses he had indulged in with Motörhead had taken their toll, and led to Clarke being admitted to hospital, spending time afterwards in recuperation. Having recovered, Clarke released a solo album, \"It Ain't Over Till It's Over\", which blends Motörhead and Fastway styles. Lemmy also helped out on the album by writing and singing the track \"Laugh at the Devil\". The double CD release, \"Fast Eddie Clarke Anthology\", on Sanctuary Records showcased a collection of Clarke's music spanning his career before and after Motörhead. It also marked a return to live performances with a re-formed Fastway, including an appearance in the UK at the Download Festival in summer 2007.\n\nIn 2014, Clarke went back to his blues roots and released a new studio album through Secret Records. \"Make My Day: Back To Blues\" was a collaboration between Clarke and the keyboardist from Shakatak, Bill Sharpe. Clarke reunited with Lemmy on 6 November 2014 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham to play the Motörhead track, \"Ace of Spades\".\n\nClarke died on 10 January 2018, aged 67, in a hospital where he was being treated for pneumonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was also billed under the names Peggy Castle and Peggie Call.\n\nCastle was born in Appalachia, Wise County, Virginia. She changed her last name \"because there was another actress named Blair at the first studio in which she worked.\" Her father, Doyle H. Blair, was at one point \"an industrial relations director for a large corporation\" and later business manager for Donald O'Connor. She took lessons in drama when she was 8 years old. She attended Mills College for two years.\n\nCastle's first work as an actress came in the soap opera \"Today's Children\". Then a spot on \"Radio Theatre\" in 1947 brought her a screen test offer from 20th Century Fox.\n\nCastle was discovered by a talent scout while eating in a restaurant in Beverly Hills. She was signed to a seven-year contract with Universal-International and made her film debut in the 1947 film \"When a Girl's Beautiful\". In 1949, she was named \"Miss Cheesecake\" by the Southern California Restaurant Association. Later that year, the Junior Chamber of Commerce named Castle \"Miss Three Alarm\". She later appeared in such films as \"Payment on Demand\" (1951), \"The Prince Who Was a Thief\" (1951) \"Invasion U.S.A.\" (1952), \"99 River Street\" (1953), \"Beginning of the End\" (1957) and \"Arrivederci Roma\" (1957).\n\nIn the 1950s, Castle moved into television. She appeared in multiple guest roles on \"Fireside Theater\", \"Cheyenne\", \"77 Sunset Strip\", and \"The Restless Gun\". In 1957 she appeared as Amy Gordon on \"Cheyenne\" in the episode titled \"The Spanish Grant.\" In 1957 she played defendant Sally Fenner in the \"Perry Mason\" episode, \"The Case of the Negligent Nymph.\"\n\nFrom 1959 to 1962, she co-starred in the television western series \"Lawman\" — her first continuing series. Her role as saloon owner Lily Merrill brought out a new dimension of Castle's talent. She stated \"For the first time in my life I'm a singer — that's the producer's opinion, not mine.\"\n\nHer final onscreen role was a guest appearance in a 1966 episode of \"The Virginian\".\n\nIn 1960, Castle and Peter Brown (who also was a regular in \"Lawman\") traveled to rodeos, performing as a song-and-dance team. Castle stressed, \"We're very careful not to sing any romantic songs,\" treating the act more like a brother-sister team. The duo's stops included St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Albuquerque.\n\nCastle was married four times. Her first marriage was to Revis Call. They married in 1945 and divorced in 1950. She married Universal publicist Robert H. Raines January 4, 1951. They divorced April 29, 1954. Her third marriage was to producer/director William McGarry in 1955.

The party proclaimed itself on 7 July 1933 at 1032 Prospect Avenue, Bronx, Branch headquarters of its predecessor Industrial Union League (IUL). The new IUP immediately announced candidates in the New York City elections: Adolph Silver for Mayor, Irving Oring for Comptroller, and Sam Brandon for President of Alderman.\n\nThe party's publication, the \"Industrial Unionist\", was published first in May 1932 with its final issue in 1950. Most of the IUP would later reconstitute itself as the League for Socialist Reconstruction\n\nNoting the roots of IUP in the Socialist Labor Party (SLP), IUP's split from the SLP reflected the impact of the Great Depression and the inability of the SLP to adjust to new events. Yet the immediate roots of the Industrial Union League were in the SLP's mass expulsion of Section Bronx during the 1920s. (\"Industrial Unionist\" did not appear until 1932, but its first issue included Louis Lazarowitz' review of Walter H. Senior's \"The Bankruptcy of Reform\", published by the Industrial Union League itself).\n\nIn November 1933 a furniture union in Jamestown, New York, the United Workers of America, was founded on industrial unionist principles compatible with the views of the IUP. The union affiliated with the Bronx-based party in December of that year, and soon formed a \"mixed trades\" local in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n"}

It sits at 11°16′32″N 49°9′0″E on the outer edge of the city of Bosaso, the commercial capital of the northeastern Puntland macro-region and adjacent to the Gulf of Aden. It is the fourth largest airport in the country after the Aden Adde International Airport in Mogadishu, the Hargeisa International Airport in Hargeisa and the Berbera Airport in Berbera.\n\nConstruction of the Bender Qassim International Airport started in 2007. Funds for the project were initially supplied by United Arab Emirates-based financiers.\n\nIn 2008, the Puntland government signed a multi-million US dollar deal with Dubai's Lootah Group, a regional industrial organization operating in the Middle East and Africa. According to the agreement, the first phase of the investment is worth Dhs 170m and would see a set of new companies established to operate, manage and build Bosaso's free trade zone and sea and airport facilities. The Bosaso Airport Company was also slated to develop the airport complex to meet international standards, including a new 3.4 km runway, main and auxiliary buildings, taxi and apron areas, and security perimeters.\n\nFollowing the 2008 Puntland presidential elections, airport renovations came to a standstill as greater focus was placed on activities in the regional capital of Garowe.\n\nIn 2012, a Product-Sharing Agreement signed between the Puntland government and the Australian oil company Range Resources earmarked $5 million USD for the construction of an airport runway. Renovations subsequently resumed, with a bricklaying ceremony for the new runway held in November of the year at the Bender Qassim International Airport. The event was attended by various Puntland government officials and businesspeople, including Bosaso Mayor Hassan Abdallah Hassan, Bari region Governor Abdisamad Gallan, and Ministry of Aviation official Saida Hussein Ali.\n\nIn late September 2013, a launching ceremony of tender process for the Bosaso airport's renovations was held at the facility. The event was attended by Puntland government and aviation officials as well as representatives of around 20 international companies, with over 24 firms vying for the project. The tender is slated to be closed in mid-October. According to Puntland Deputy Minister of Civil Aviation Abdiqani Gelle, the winner of the tender process is then scheduled to mobilize its operation within a two-month period. The airport renovations are being overseen by the Puntland government, with the Italian authorities funding the project through UNOPS. It will include the extension of the Bosaso airport's gravel runway from 1,800 m to 2,650 m. The runway's width will also be widened from 30 m to 45 m, and feature 7.5 m gravel shoulders on both sides. According to Gelle, the Puntland government plans to carry out similar upgrades at the Garowe, Galkayo and Qardho airports.\n\nIn December 2014, the foundation stone for a new runway was laid at the airport. The inauguration event was attended by cabinet ministers, legislators, traditional leaders, and various international officials, including tender winner China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, financial partner and Ambassador of Italy to Somalia Farbizio Marcelli, and United Nations Office for Project Services representatives. The China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation is now slated to upgrade the airport's existing gravel runway, pave it with asphalt, and convert it from 1.8 km to 2.65 km in accordance with the code 4C operations clause.\n\nOn 8 January 2016, The renovated and modernized Bosaso Airport was officially reopened, the reopening event attended by President of the federal republic of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Puntland president Abdiweli Mohamed Ali federal and regional ministers, Mayor of Bosaso Yasin Mire Mohamud, the constructor CCECC, Italian Ambassador, and other distinguished guests and foreign envoys as well as Traditional elders include Ugas Hassan Ugas Yasin.\n\n\n"}

The category is included here because of the evidence that children with moderate to severe intellectual disability (IQ below 35) who exhibit major problems in hyperactivity and inattention frequently show stereotyped behaviours; such children tend not to benefit from stimulant drugs (unlike those with an IQ in the normal range) and may exhibit a severe dysphoric reaction (sometimes with psychomotor retardation) when given stimulants; in adolescence the overactivity tends to be replaced by underactivity (a pattern that is not usual in hyperkinetic children with normal intelligence). It is also common for the syndrome to be associated with a variety of developmental delays, either specific or global. The extent to which the behavioural pattern is a function of low IQ or of organic brain damage is not known, neither is it clear whether the disorders in children with mild intellectual disability who show the hyperkinetic syndrome would be better classified here or under F90.- (Hyperkinetic disorders); at present they are included in F90-.\n\nDiagnostic guidelines\n\nDiagnosis depends on the combination of developmentally inappropriate severe overactivity, motor stereotypies, and moderate to severe intellectual disability; all three must be present for the diagnosis. If the diagnostic criteria for F84.0 (childhood autism), F84.1 (atypical autism) or F84.2 (Rett's syndrome) are met, that condition should be diagnosed instead.\n\n"}

The instrument consists of four modular string units, each of which can be controlled with MIDI. GuitarBot was used by guitarist Pat Metheny on his 2009 Orchestrion tour.\n\nThe GuitarBot modules are built on an aluminum base. Each base serves as a mounting point for the module's string, moving bridge subsystem, and pickwheel subsystem. The modules measure 91 centimeters long by 10 centimeters wide and are mounted vertically on a purpose-built support structure, which also houses the units' electronics.\n\nGuitarBot uses a belt-drive mechanism to change pitch. An encoder-equipped DC motor drives a belt with an attached movable fret. As the belt moves the movable fret, the string's pitch is changed. The movable fret is mounted on a ball bearing linear slide, and can traverse its full displacement of 54.4 centimeters in 250 ms.\n\nGuitarBot's movable fret system is configured as a slide mechanism and remains in constant contact with the string. To reduce friction between GuitarBot's wire-wound strings and the movable fret, flatwound strings are used. The flatwound strings' lack of ridges allow the movable bridge to slide over the string smoothly.\n\nOther mechatronic guitar and string-playing systems that employ similar pitch-shifting mechanisms include Nicholas A. Baginsky's Aglaopheme self-playing guitar, Trimpin's prototype KrautKontrol guitar systems, James McVay's MechBass, and Festo Automation's Sound Machines.\n\nString picking is accomplished with a rotary pick wheel mechanism. Four picks are attached to an idler pulley on a belt-driven DC motor. As the motor spins, the pick wheel rotates.\n\nA solenoid actuator is used to dampen GuitarBot's strings.\n\nEach GuitarBot module uses a PIC microcontroller to handle motor control, feedback, and damping. The modules on each unit receive MIDI input, allowing external sequencers to control GuitarBot.\n\nA PID control scheme is used for the bridge positioning subsystem. The control coefficients used in the feedback systems for the pickwheel, bridge positioning system, and damper state can be modified on the fly with MIDI commands.\n\n"}

Lowery released his first solo album, \"The Palace Guards\", on February 2, 2011, via the 429 Records label.\n\nLowery was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of a career Air Force father. He has described his parents as \"a hillbilly and an English working-class woman.\" His family moved around a great deal during his youth before finally settling in Redlands, California, where he attended high school. He became involved in music as a member of the band Sitting Ducks, who played a mixture of punk and acid rock, along with what Lowery described as \"fake Russian-sounding music.\" Sitting Ducks subsequently evolved into Camper Van Beethoven, formed in 1983 in Santa Cruz, California. The band is best known for its cover of the Status Quo song \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\" from the \"Key Lime Pie\" LP and its original composition \"Take the Skinheads Bowling,\" from the band's 1985 debut LP, \"Telephone Free Landslide Victory,\" later featured in the Michael Moore movie \"Bowling for Columbine.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, Lowery formed Cracker with guitarist and long-time friend Johnny Hickman and bassist Davey Faragher. Cracker rejected the indie-rock sound of Camper Van Beethoven in favor of a more traditional, roots-rock sound. Cracker's biggest hits are \"Teen Angst (What the World Needs Now)\" from its eponymous LP, released in 1992, and \"Low,\" from 1993's \"Kerosene Hat.\" Cracker continues to perform today, although Camper Van Beethoven has also reformed, releasing a cover of the entire Fleetwood Mac album \"Tusk\" in 2002 and several new albums of original music, beginning with \"New Roman Times\" in 2004.\nLowery has also done work as a producer at Sound of Music Studios in Richmond, Virginia, working on records by Sparklehorse, Counting Crows, Lauren Hoffman, September 67, Wormburner, LP, Tea Leaf Green, Magnet, Sons of Bill and others. Lowery, along with Ian Solla-Yates of WNRN started RadioVA with Sound of Music in May 2010, an interview program hosted by David that has featured The Hold Steady, Drive-By Truckers, Minus the Bear and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.\n\nOn September 13, 2010, David married Velena Vego. Vego has been the manager for both Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven since 2004. She is also the talent booker for the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia, and Buckhead Theatre in Atlanta.\n\nLowery is a trained mathematician who has worked as a \"quant\" (a derivatives trader and financial analyst) and has started a number of music-related businesses, including a studio, a record company and a publishing company.\nLowery's extensive experience in business led to his appointment as a lecturer in the University of Georgia's music business program.\n\nLowery earned an Ed.D. from the University of Georgia in 2018. Charles Pitter at PopMatters has said that \"in addition to this work, Lowery teaches as a lecturer and has a consistently high profile in the media as a champion of artists rights. As such, it could almost be said that Lowery has become the voice of a generation; however, it seems likely he would dismiss this title as meaningless blabber.\"\n\nLowery is critical of the internet era and states that things might be worse for working musicians than under the old record system. In 2012, he gave a widely shared talk called \"Meet the new boss, worse than the old boss\" in which he criticized Pandora Radio for low songwriter royalties, claiming to have made less than $17 from a million streams of his song \"Low.\"\n\nIn January 2019, Lowery settled a lawsuit against Napster, which concerned unpaid mechanical royalties.\n\n\n"}

As Final Fantasy, he won the 2006 Polaris Music Prize for the album \"He Poos Clouds\".\n\nFrom the age of 3, Pallett studied classical violin, and composed his first piece at age 13. A notable early composition includes some of the music for the game \"Traffic Department 2192\"; he moved on to scoring films, to composing two operas while in university. Apart from the indie music scene, he has had commissions from the Barbican, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, National Ballet of Canada, Bang on a Can, Ecstatic Music Festival, the Vancouver CBC Orchestra, and Fine Young Classicals.\n\nOn his Final Fantasy releases, Pallett has collaborated with Leon Taheny, who is credited as drummer and engineer. Following the release of \"Heartland\", Pallett has toured with guitarist/percussionist Thomas Gill and more recently with his former collaborators in Les Mouches, Rob Gordon and Matt Smith.\n\nPallett has been noted for his live performances, wherein he plays the violin into a loop pedal. Pallett uses Max/MSP and SooperLooper to do multi-phonic looping, which sends his violin signal to amplifiers across the stage.\n\nIn January 2014, Pallett and William Butler were nominated for Best Original Score at the 86th Academy Awards for their work on \"Her\".\n\nThe name \"Final Fantasy\", under which Pallett recorded prior to the release of \"Heartland\", was a tribute to the well-known video game series, although he said that it is not one of his top twenty favorite games.\nPallett's debut album, \"Has a Good Home\", was released on February 12, 2005, by the Blocks Recording Club, a cooperative, Toronto-based record label of which he is a founding member. \"An Arrow in the Side of Final Fantasy\" borrows the music from the Space Zone's final level in \"\". \"Adventure.exe\" from this album was used in a series of 2006 commercials by Orange in the United Kingdom.< Pallett did not intend to sell the song for this purpose, but its use was authorized due to an alleged miscommunication with his record label, Tomlab. All of Pallett's income from this use is donated to Doctors Without Borders.\n\nPallett's second album, \"He Poos Clouds\", was released in June 2006, though the video, directed by Jesse Ewles, was released on March 1, 2006. The album consists entirely of string quartet arrangements. Eight of the ten songs are about each of the schools of magic as described in the rules to the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" fantasy role-playing game. The album was named winner of the 2006 Polaris Music Prize. Uncomfortable with receiving a prize sponsored by a mobile phone conglomerate, Pallett gave the money away to bands he liked who needed financial assistance.\n\nIN July, 2007, Pallett was interviewed on the CBC Radio One program \"Q\", about his upcoming album, to be titled \"Heartland\", which was to have a theme of nothingness.\n\nIn 2007, the song \"This Is The Dream of Win & Regine\" was used in a commercial for Wiener Stadtwerke without Pallett's permission. Instead of litigation, Pallett and his booking agent Susanne Herrndorf approached the company for sponsorship for a music festival of their curation. The resultant Maximum Black Festival featured Final Fantasy, The Dirty Projectors, Deerhoof, Frog Eyes, Max Tundra, Six Organs of Admittance and others. It played Vienna, Berlin and London. In September 2007 they did a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon.\n\nIn October 2007 Final Fantasy released a vinyl 7\" on Tomlab's Alphabet Single series ( The Letter \"X\" ). The two tracks on \"X\", recorded in Montreal with Zach Condon, of the band Beirut; predate the album \"He Poos Clouds\". The tracks – \"Hey Dad\" and \"What Do You Think Will Happen Next?\" are both played regularly at live shows. The song \"Hey Dad\" contains a melody borrowed from the Nintendo video game \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"; specifically it is the music from the \"Coin Heaven\" bonus/hidden stages. Also, the song is quite similar in melody, lyrics and tone to another of Pallett's songs – \"→\".\n\nIn March 2008, Owen Pallett under the alias Final Fantasy, collaborated with Grizzly Bear's Ed Droste on a cover of Björk's \"Possibly Maybe\" as part of Stereogum's tribute to Björk's album, \"Post\".\n\nIn Fall 2008, Pallett released two EPs. The first one, \"Spectrum, 14th Century\", was a collaboration with Beirut. The second EP, \"Plays To Please\", was a tribute to fellow Torontonian Alex Lukashevsky and his group Deep Dark United. On it, six Lukashevsky originals were reconfigured for a 35-piece big band, the Toronto-based St. Kitts Orchestra (which includes Drumheller's Nick Fraser, Paul Mathew of the Hidden Cameras, and a whistling Andrew Bird, among others).\n\nOn December, 2009, Pallett began performing and recording under his own name. The album \"Heartland\"was released on Domino Records on January 12, 2010. It was mixed by New York producer Rusty Santos. Also he played Primavera Sound Festival 2010. In August 2010, Pallett released a four track EP entitled \"A Swedish Love Story\" on September 28 via Domino. The tracks received substantial airplay on community radio.\n\nOn November 12, 2012, Pallett tweeted that he had been working on a new album called \"In Conflict\". The album, his fourth full-length recording, was released May 27, 2014.\n\nPallett's previous projects included a 3-piece Toronto-based band, Les Mouches, now defunct. He also played fiddle for a short time with the Celtic rock band Enter the Haggis. He was once the violinist of another Toronto band called Picastro, and briefly played keyboard in SS Cardiacs (with Leon Taheny, Jessie Stein and Michael Small in 2005). Pallett has also recorded and toured with Jim Guthrie, The Hidden Cameras, Royal City, The Vinyl Cafe, Gentleman Reg, and Arcade Fire (he co-wrote the strings arrangement for their albums \"Funeral\" and \"Neon Bible\"). One of his songs, \"This Is the Dream of Win & Regine\", was inspired by the principal members of the latter group, Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, and is a play on a Dntel song called, \"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan.\"\n\nPallett contributed remixes for the bands Stars, Grizzly Bear and Death from Above 1979. He also wrote string arrangements for the Canadian bands Immaculate Machine, on their 2007 album, \"Fables\", and Fucked Up, on their 2006 album \"Hidden World\". He also wrote the string arrangements for the Beirut album \"The Flying Club Cup\", as well as provided vocals for the track \"Cliquot\". Most recently, he provided orchestration for the side project of Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner and former Rascals frontman Miles Kane, as The Last Shadow Puppets, entitled \"The Age of the Understatement\". Pallett also conducted the London Metropolitan Orchestra in the recording of this project.\n\nIn June 2009 at Luminato, Toronto's annual festival of arts and creativity, Pallett provided part of the live soundtrack for the outdoor screening (at Yonge-Dundas Square) of the 1919 silent German horror film \"Tales of the Uncanny\" (\"Unheimliche Geschichten\"), alongside Canadian instrumental band Do Make Say Think and electronica music artist Robert Lippok from Berlin, Germany.\n\nPallett recorded with Arcade Fire in 2010 while they were making their 2010 album \"The Suburbs\". It later received a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn 2009, Pallett worked with Win Butler and Régine Chassagne on the score for Richard Kelly's film \"The Box\". Pallett was also initially set to score \"Rabbit Hole\", a film by John Cameron Mitchell, but in the end the film was scored by Anton Sanko. In late 2010, Pallett was named as composer for T Magazine's \"Fourteen Actors Acting\" project; he received, alongside the producers of that series, an Emmy Award for \"New Approaches to News & Documentary Programming: Arts, Lifestyle and Culture\".\n\nPallett collaborated with John Darnielle of The Mountain Goats in 2012 when several songs from the \"Transcendental Youth\" album were performed in concert with the all-female vocal quartet Anonymous 4 and featured Pallett's arrangements for piano, guitar and voices.\n\nPallett scored the 2013 film \"The Wait\" directed by M Blash.\n\nPallett was born in Mississauga, Ontario and grew up in Milton. He received an Honours Bachelor of Music for Composition from the University of Toronto in 2002.\n\nPallett believes his work is implicitly influenced by his sexuality, saying, \"As far as whether the music I make is gay or queer, yeah, it comes from the fact that I'm gay, but that doesn't mean I'm making music about it.\"\n\nPatrick Borjal, Pallett's boyfriend, began working as his manager in 2006, and formed the management company Boyfriend Management.\n\nIn 2014, Pallett penned an open letter weighing in on the Jian Ghomeshi abuse scandal.\n\nIn 2018, Pallett was accused of sexual assault by an unnamed woman he allegedly met in 2015. The case was settled out of court in 2019. The woman-in-question stated that her allegations were false, and issued an apology and a retraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Mangalappuzha, a branch of Periyar which bifurcates at Aluva was known to be the nerve centre of trade and commerce in this part of South India. Before Indian independence, Aluva was part of the Kingdom of Travancore and was the official summer residence of the royal family.\n\nThe etymology of the name of the town of Aluva has been the subject of speculation for centuries. One of the more accepted version relates to the story of Hindu god Shiva drinking the Kalakootam poison to save the world. It is said that Shiva with the poison 'Alam' in his mouth 'Vaa' was made into a deity which was then rested in a temple in Aluva. The Sivarathri festival for which the town is famous for is celebrated in the honour of Shiva.

Popular tourist spots include:\n\n\nThe culture scene of Aluva is rich with those who are native of this town and those who have been attracted to it mainly due its proximity to the great river Periyar.\n\nSeveral popular Malayalam movie songs are dedicated to the river Periyar. Famous poets Changapuzha Krishna Pillai, G. Sankara Kurup and Balachandran Chullikkadu, and critic Kuttipuzha Krishnapilla, and novelist Subash Chandran are from Aluva and lived there. Though not from Aluva area, Vayalar Ramavarma and O.N.V Kurup wrote about Periyar and the town Aluva was an integral part of their paying homage to the most lively river of the state of Kerala, Periyar.\n\nThe mimicry comedy revolution that dominated the cultural landscape of Kerala beginning 1980's originated in Aluva by stand-up comedians from that area, though they got larger audience and fans in Kochi and in Malayalam movies later which would make them cultural fixations of Kerala's pop culture.

Aluva has many business headquarters, including:\n\nMany educational institutions are located in Aluva.\n\n\n\nThere are two railway stations in Aluva: Aluva Railway Station anmd Chowwara Railway Station. Aluva Railway Station is a major stop for trains that passes north to south of Kerala. It is the second busiest station in Kerala by number of trains, second only to Thrissur. The station is important for southern railway because of the number of passengers itself. The commuters and travellers from Idukki district have to use either this station or the Tripunithura railway station for all their train journeys as there is no possible railway in the Idukki topography. There are no trains starting or ending at this station, but there are a lot of trains which stop for considerable duration here.\n\nAluva Railway Station is situated at the Railway Station Road junction near the KSRTC stand. The KSRTC stand hosts many buses from Ernakulam and a lot of City Low Floor buses, both A/C and non A/C.\n\nThe Mahadeva Temple is situated at a distance of 1 km from the Marthanda Varma bridge in NH-47. Periyar river splits into two near Aluva railway bridge and after the splitting one part is called Mangalappuzha. Aluva Mahadeva Temple is located on the sand bank in between the Mangalppuzha and Periyar river. Aluva Mahadeva Temple is managed by Travancore Devaswom Board.\n\nThe unique feature of Aluva Mahadeva Temple is that the Shivalinga is not enshrined in a Sreekovil. The Swayambhoo Shivalinga installed by Lord Parasurama and worshipped by Lord Sree Rama rises out of the sand banks of the Periyar river. This place is called the Aluva Manal Puram (land with sand).\n\nThere are many legends associated with this temple. After installing the Lingam Parasurama built a temple here but was destroyed by a flood. Lord Shiva told him that no temple structure will exist at that place because He does not want a temple structure for protecting the Lingam. Another legend goes like this. The Bhuthaganas of Lord Shiva worshiped the Lingam every night. They decided to construct a temple there. But Lord Shiva told them that they must complete the temple in a single night. Bhuthaganas agreed and started the construction. When the foundation was completed, Lord Vishnu came there, disguised as a cock and crowed to mislead the Bhuthaganas. The Bhuthaganas, fearing that dawn had approached, left the work unfinished. Sri Rama, during his search for Sitha, performed tharpana for Jadayu here. Another legend is associated with Vilwamangalam Swamiyar. One day he visited this place and realised the presence of Lord Shiva and identified the Shiva Linga installed by Parasurama. He started worshipping the Linga and Lord Mahadeva appeared in front of him and told him to start poojas there. Pottayil Ilayathu, Thottathil Nambiar and Idamana Nampoothiri made proper arrangements for Shiva Pooja and Vilwamngalam started the pooja. But there were no vessels to offer Nivedyam. So Vilwamangalam used a Kavungin Pala (aracanut leaf) to offer Nivedyam. Even today the nivedyam is offered in Kavungin Pala and is called Palanivedyam. Later Vilwamangalam and his associates – Ilayathu, Nambiar and Nampoothiri – constructed a temple but it was destroyed by flood in AD 1343. During the monsoon season the whole region gets flooded and the Shivalinga gets submerged in water. So the Ooranma Nampoothiris were decided to construct a small temple on the bank of the river in order to perform poojas during monsoon season. This temple is called Bala Kshetram. It is a fact that though unfinished in nature, this temple has withstood many a flood and still stands as an enigma to the architects, regarding its foundation and structure. The Travancore Devaswom Board authorities constructed a temple structure here some years ago. but the Deva Prasna conducted later revealed that construction of the temple structure is against Lord Shiva's wish.\n\nKochi Metro Rail Limited, the pride project of Kerala Government, undertaken by DMRC starts from Aluva Bypass. Aluva metro station is the northern terminus of the line which was open on 19 June 2017. The construction was started on mid of 2013. Kochi Metro is expected to overcome the traffic problems in Aluva – Ernakulam route. Kochi metro is expected to raise the civil infrastructure of the city. Development of Kochi metro has raised the commercial value of the land.\n\n\n"}

King\n\nEdward Postell King Jr. (July 4, 1884 – August 31, 1958) was a Major General in the United States Army who gained prominence for leading the defense of the Bataan Peninsula in the Battle of Bataan against the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in World War II.\n\nKing was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1884. As the grandson and nephew of Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, King had a strong desire to be a soldier. He entered the University of Georgia, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and graduated in 1902.\n\nInitially his family wanted him to be a lawyer but he desired a more adventurous career. He applied for and received a commission in the Army in 1908. He served with distinction during World War I, earning the Distinguished Service Medal. The President on 9 July 1918 authorised awarding the Army DSM to Major King, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. As Principal Assistant to the Chief of Field Artillery, from 23 March 1918 to 11 November 1918, Major King contributed largely to the successful solution of the difficult problems of expansion, organization, and training which then confronted the Field Artillery. Between World War I and World War II, King held several important assignments including that of instructor in both the Army and Navy War Colleges. In 1940 he was sent to the Philippines where he was promptly promoted to Brigadier General; he served as General Douglas MacArthur's second highest ranking ground officer, after General Jonathan Wainwright.\n\nOn 11 March 1942, by order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, MacArthur left for Australia. Wainwright was appointed to succeed MacArthur as General of the Armies of the Philippines while King became the Commanding General of the Philippine-American forces on the Bataan Peninsula. At the time, King was the commander of the artillery.\n\nAfter months of fighting the invading Japanese Army and with food and medicine exhausted, King himself, accepting sole responsibility to disobey MacArthur's and Wainwright's orders, chose to surrender his troops on 9 April 1942. (This day is commemorated in the Philippines as Araw ng Kagitingan \"Day of Valor\"). A combined American and Filipino force of over 75,000 surrendered; this was the largest surrender of a military force in American history. Thousands of these soldiers would die under Japanese captivity during the ensuing Bataan Death March and imprisonment.\n\nWainwright and his men, numbering 10,000, held on to Corregidor until they too were forced to surrender on 6 May 1942.\n\nKing spent three and half years as a captive of the Japanese and was often mistreated by them because of his rank. Both Wainwright and King expected court-martial for disobeying the no-surrender order. However, they were treated as heroes when they were finally freed.\n\n \n\nCitation for the first award of the Distinguished-Service Medal to General King:\n\nEdgar King, brigadier general (then colonel), United States Army. For exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service to the government in the performance of duty of great responsibility. Brigadier General King conceived and skillfully formulated a plan for the operations in the war of the Medical Department in Hawaii, the planning of which was brilliantly justified by its success in battle. His execution of this plan on December 7th, 1941, was performed with such consummate skillas to save an unprecedented proportion of wounded, elicit the admiration of the medical world, and bring distinction upon the Medical Department of the Army. Entered military service from Alabama. \n\nAfter the war, King returned to the United States where he retired to a home in Georgia, devoting himself to many volunteer causes, such as the Red Cross. He died in 1958, and is buried at the Cemetery of St. John in the Wilderness Episcopal Church – Flat Rock, NC.\n\nWriter John Grisham utilizes King as a character in his fictional novel The Reckoning (Grisham novel). Part of the story takes place at Camp O'Donnell during World War II.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2242140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242140", "title": "Mary Jemison", "text": "Mary Jemison\n\nMary Jemison (Deh-he-wä-nis) (1743 – September 19, 1833) was a Scots-Irish colonial frontierswoman in Pennsylvania and New York, who became known as the \"White Woman of the Genesee.\" She had been taken as a youth and adopted into a Seneca family, assimilating to their culture, marrying two Native American men in succession, and having children with them. In 1824 she published a memoir of her life, a form of captivity narrative.\nIn 1755 during the French and Indian War, Jemison at age 12 was captured with most of her family in a Shawnee mourning raid in what is now Adams County, Pennsylvania. The others of her family were killed. She and an unrelated young boy were adopted by Seneca families. She became fully assimilated, marrying a Delaware (Lenape), and, after his death, a Seneca man. She chose to remain a Seneca rather than return to British colonial culture. \n\nJemison told her story late in life to an American minister, who wrote it for her. He published it as \"Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison\" (1824). It was reprinted in the late 20th century. In 1874 her remains were reinterred near a historic Seneca council house on a private estate, in what is now Letchworth State Park.\n\nMary Jemison was born to Thomas and Jane Jemison aboard the ship \"William and Mary\" in the fall of 1743, while en route from what is now Northern Ireland to America. They landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and joined other Protestant Scots-Irish immigrants in heading west to settle on cheaper available lands in the backcountry, what was then the western frontier (now central Pennsylvania). They \"squatted\" on territory that had been purchased by the Penn family in 1736 from chiefs of the Iroquois Confederacy, six nations that were based in central and western New York.\n\nThe Jemisons had cleared land to develop their farm, and the couple had several children. By 1755, conflicts had started in the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War between France and Britain. Both sides made use of Native American allies, especially in the frontier areas where they had few regular forces. One morning in early 1755, a raiding party consisting of six Shawnee Indians and four Frenchmen captured Mary, the rest of her family (except two older brothers), and a young boy from another family. En route to French-controlled Fort Duquesne (present-day Pittsburgh), the Shawnee killed Mary's mother, father, and siblings, and ritually scalped them.\n\nMary later learned that it was a Seneca custom, when one of their own was killed or taken prisoner in battle, to take an enemy as prisoner or to take their scalp in a mourning ritual. Two Seneca women had lost a brother in the French and Indian War a year before Mary's capture, and in this mourning raid, the Shawnee intended to capture a prisoner or obtain an enemy's scalp to compensate them. The 12-year-old Mary and the young boy were spared, likely because they were of suitable age for adoption. Once the party reached Fort Duquesne, Mary was given to the two Seneca women, who took her downriver to their settlement. After a short ceremony, a Seneca family adopted Mary, renaming her as \"Deh-he-wä-nis\" (other romanization variants include: Dehgewanus, Dehgewanus and Degiwanus, Dickewamis). She learned this meant \"a pretty girl, a handsome girl, or a pleasant, good thing.\"\n\nWhen she came of age, Mary married a Delaware man named \"Sheninjee,\" who was living with the band. They had a son whom she named Thomas after her father. Sheninjee took her on a journey to the Sehgahunda Valley along the Genesee River in present-day Western New York state. Although Jemison and their son reached this destination, her husband did not. While hunting one day on their journey, he was taken ill and died.\n\nAs a widow, Mary and her child were taken in by Sheninjee's clan relatives; she made her home at Little Beard's Town (where present-day Cuylerville, New York later developed). She married again, to a Seneca named \"Hiakatoo\", and together they had six children: Nancy, Polly, Betsey, Jane, John, and Jesse, who were given Seneca names and raised in that culture. John had a troubled life. He killed his brother Jesse in 1811, and was later also killed. \n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Seneca allied with the British, hoping that a British victory would enable them to expel the encroaching colonists. Jemison's account of her life includes observations of this time. She and others in the Seneca town helped supply Joseph Brant (Mohawk) and his Iroquois warriors from various nations, who fought the rebel colonists.\n\nAfter the war, the British ceded their holdings east of the Mississippi River to the United States, without consulting their Native American allies. The Seneca were forced to give up their lands to the United States. In 1797 the Seneca sold much of their land at Little Beard's Town to Americans. At that time, during negotiations with the Holland Land Company held at Geneseo, New York, Mary Jemison proved to be an able negotiator for the Seneca tribe. She helped win more favorable terms for surrendering their rights to the land at the Treaty of Big Tree (1797).\n\nLate in life, Jemison told her story to the minister James E. Seaver, who published it as \"Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison\" (1824; latest ed. 1967). It is considered a classic captivity narrative. Although some early readers thought that Seaver must have imposed his own beliefs, since the late 20th century, many history scholars have thought the memoir is a reasonably accurate account of Jemison's life story and attitude. By staying with the Seneca, she showed that she preferred life with the Seneca to what she had seen of the lives of colonial British women. \n\nIn 1823, the Seneca sold most of their remaining land in that area, except for a tract of land reserved for Jemison's use. Known by local European-American residents as the \"White Woman of the Genesee\", Jemison lived on the tract for several years. In 1831 she sold it and moved to the Buffalo Creek Reservation, where some Seneca lived (others had gone to Ontario, Canada). Jemison died on September 19, 1833, aged 90. She was initially buried on the Buffalo Creek Reservation. Jemison's heirs later changed their surname to \"Jimerson\" and established the community of Jimersontown on the Allegany Indian Reservation.\n\n\"The party that took us consisted of six Indians and four Frenchmen, who immediately commenced plundering, as I just observed, and took what they considered most valuable; consisting principally of bread, meal, and meat. Having taken as much provision as they could carry, they set out with their prisoners in great haste, for fear of detection, and soon entered the woods.\n\nOn our march that day, an Indian went behind us with a whip, with which he frequently lashed the children, to make them keep up. In this manner we traveled till dark, without a mouthful of food or a drop of water, although we had not eaten since the night before. Whenever the little children cried for water, the Indians would make them drink urine, or go thirsty. At night they encamped in the woods, without fire and without shelter, where we were watched with the greatest vigilance. Extremely fatigued, and very hungry, we were compelled to lie upon the ground, without supper or a drop of water to satisfy the cravings of our appetites. As in the daytime, so the little ones were made to drink urine in the night, if they cried for water. Fatigue alone brought us a little sleep for the refreshment of our weary limbs; and at the dawn of day we were again started on our march, in the same order that we had proceeded the day before.\n\nAbout sunrise we were halted, and the Indians gave us a full breakfast of provision that they had brought from my father's house. Each of us, being very hungry, partook of this bounty of the Indians, except father, who was so much overcome with his situation, so much exhausted by anxiety and grief, that silent despair seemed fastened upon his countenance, and he could not be prevailed upon to refresh his sinking nature by the use of a morsel of food. Our repast being finished, we again resumed our march; and before noon passed a small fort, that I heard my father say was called Fort Canagojigge.\n\nThat was the only time that I heard him speak from the time we were taken till we were finally separated the following night.\n\nToward evening, we arrived at the border of a dark and dismal swamp, which was covered with small hemlocks or some other evergreen, and various kinds of bushes, into which we were conducted; and having gone a short distance, we stopped to encamp for the night.\n\nHere we had some bread and meat for supper; but the dreariness of our situation, together with the uncertainty under which we all labored, as to our future destiny, almost deprived us of the sense of hunger, and destroyed our relish for food.\n\nAs soon as I had finished my supper, an Indian took off my shoes and stockings, and put a pair of moccasins on my feet, which my mother observed; and believing that they would spare my life, even if they should destroy the other captives, addressed me, as near as I can remember, in the following words:\n\n'My dear little Mary, I fear that the time has arrived when we must be parted for ever. Your life, my child, I think will be spared; but we shall probably be tomahawked here in this lonesome place by the Indians. Oh! how can I part with you, my darling? What will become of my sweet little Mary? Oh! how can I think of your being continued in captivity, without a hope of your being rescued? Oh! that death had snatched you from my embraces in your infancy: the pain of parting then would have been pleasing to what It now is; and I should have seen the end of your troubles! Alas, my dear! my heart bleeds at the thought of what awaits you; but, if you leave us, remember, my child, your own name, and the names of your father and mother. Be careful and not forget your English tongue. If you shall have an opportunity to get away from the Indians don't try to escape; for if you do they will find and destroy you. Don't forget, my little daughter, the prayers that I have learned you - say them often: be a good child, and God will bless you! May God bless you, my child, and make you comfortable and happy.'\n\nDuring this time, the Indians stripped the shoes and stockings from the little boy that belonged to the woman who was taken with us, and put moccasins on his feet, as they had done before on mine. I was crying. An Indian took the little boy and myself by the hand, to lead us off from the company, when my mother exclaimed, 'Don't cry, Mary! - don't cry, my child! God will bless you! Farewell - farewell!'\n\nThe Indian led us some distance into the bushes or woods, and there lay down with us to spend the night. The recollection of parting with my tender mother kept me awake, while the tears constantly flowed from my eyes. A number of times in the night, the little boy begged of me earnestly to run away with him, and get clear of the Indians; but remembering the advice I had so lately received, and knowing the dangers to which we should be exposed, in traveling without a path and without a guide, through a wilderness unknown to us, I told him that I would not go, and persuaded him to lie still till morning.\n\nMy suspicion as to the fate of my parents proved too true; for soon after I left them they were killed and scalped, together with Robert, Matthew, Betsey, and the woman and her two children, and mangled in the most shocking manner\n\nAfter a hard day's march we encamped in a thicket, where the Indians made a shelter of boughs, and then built a good fire to warm and dry our benumbed limbs and clothing; for it had rained some through the day. Here we were again fed as before. When the Indians had finished their supper, they took from their baggage a number of scalps, and went about preparing them for the market, or to keep without spoiling, by straining them over small hoops which they prepared for that purpose, and then drying and scraping them by the fire.\n\nHaving put the scalps, yet wet and bloody, upon the hoops, and stretched them to their full extent, they held them to the fire till they were partly dried, and then, with their knives, commenced scraping off the flesh; and in that way they continued to work, alternately drying and scraping them, till they were dry and clean. That being done, they combed the hair in the neatest manner, and then painted it and the edges of the scalps, yet on the hoops, red. Those scalps I knew at the time must have been taken from our family, by the color of the hair. My mother's hair was red; and I could easily distinguish my father's and the children's from each other. That sight was most appalling; yet I was obliged to endure it without complaining. In the course of the night, they made me to understand that they should not have killed the family, if the whites had not pursued them.\"\n\n\n\n\nSources\n\nOther\n"}

H. Auden in December 1938 while he was staying in Brussels, Belgium, with Christopher Isherwood. It was first published under the title \"Palais des beaux arts\" (Palace of Fine Arts) in the Spring 1939 issue of \"New Writing\", a modernist magazine edited by John Lehmann. It next appeared in the collected volume of verse \"Another Time\" (New York: Random House, 1940), which was followed four months later by the English edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1940). The poem's title derives from the Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique in Brussels, famous for its collection of Early Netherlandish painting. Auden visited the Musée and would have seen a number of works by the \"Old Masters\" of his second line, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder.\n\n‘Musee des Beaux Arts’ by W.H. Auden describes, through the use of one specific artwork, the impact of suffering on humankind. \n\nAuden's free verse poem is divided into two parts, the first of which describes scenes of \"suffering\" and \"dreadful martyrdom\" which rarely break into our quotidian routines: \"While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully / along.\" The second half of the poem refers, through the poetic device of ekphrasis, to the painting \"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus\" (\"ca.\" 1560s), at the time thought to be by Bruegel, but now usually regarded as an early copy of a lost work. Auden's description allows us to visualize this specific moment and instance of the indifference of others to a distant individual's suffering, inconsequent to them, \"how everything turns away / Quite leisurely from the disaster ... the white legs disappearing into the green.\" The disaster in question is the fall of Icarus, caused by his flying too close to the sun and melting his waxen wings.\n\nAuden achieves much in the poem, not only with his long and irregular lines, rhythms, and vernacular phrasing (\"dogs go on with their doggy life\"), but also with this balance between what appear to be general examples \"About suffering\" and a specific example of a mythical boy's fall into the sea. Auden scholars and art historians have suggested that the first part of the poem also relies on at least two additional paintings by Bruegel which Auden would have seen in the same second-floor gallery of the museum. These identifications are based on a not quite exact, but nonetheless evocative, series of correspondences between details in the paintings and Auden's language. However, none show a \"martyrdom\" in the usual sense, suggesting that other works are also evoked. The Bruegels are presented below in the order in which they appear to relate to Auden's lines.\n\nlines 3–8:\nBruegel's \"The Census at Bethlehem\" (catalogued at the Musée as \"Le dénombrement de Bethléem\") of 1566 was acquired by the Musée in 1902. Scott Horton noted that it would be a mistake to only look to the Icarus painting when explaining Auden's poem, for \"The bulk of the poem is clearly about a different painting, in fact it's the museum's prize possession: The Census at Bethlehem.\" The painting depicts Mary and Joseph center right, she on a donkey bundled up for the snow of Bruegel's Flanders, and he leading with a red hat and long carpenter's saw over his shoulder. They are surrounded by many other people: \"someone else ... eating or opening a window or just walking dully / along.\" And there are children \"On a pond at the edge of the wood\" spinning tops and lacing on their skates.\n\nlines 9–13:\n\n\"The Massacre of the Innocents\" (catalogued at the Musée as \"Le Massacre des Innocents\") is a copy by Pieter Bruegel the Younger (1565–1636) of his father's original dated to 1565–7 (illustrated). The Musée acquired it in 1830. The scene depicted, again in a wintry Flanders landscape, is recounted in Matthew 2:16–18: Herod the Great, when told that a king would be born to the Jews, ordered the Magi to alert him when the king was found. The Magi, warned by an angel, did not and so, \"When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under.\" In relation to the \"Census\" painting then we can see why the children of Auden's poem \"did not specially want it [the miraculous birth] to happen.\"\n\nBoth this scene and the earlier are used by Bruegel to make a political comment on the Spanish Habsburg rulers of Flanders at the time (note the Habsburg coat of arms on the right front of the main building in the \"Census\" and the Spanish troops in red in \"The Massacre\" arresting peasants and knocking down doors). With respect to Auden's language we can see here \"the dreadful martyrdom must run its course\" (the innocent boys of Herod's wrath are traditionally considered the first of the Christian martyrs). We can see five of those dogs of Auden's poem going about their business and an approximation of \"the torturer's horse / Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.\" Kinney says \"Only one torturer's horse stands near a tree, however, and he is unable to rub against it because another soldier, with a battering ram, is standing between the horse and the tree ... Yet this must be the horse Auden has in mind, since it is the only torturer's horse in Bruegel's work, and the only painting with horses near trees.\"\n\nlines 14–21:\n\n\"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus\" (catalogued at the Musée as “La Chute d’Icare”) was acquired in 1912. This is the only known example of Bruegel's use of a scene from mythology, and he bases his figures and landscape quite closely on the myth of Daedalus and his son Icarus as told by Ovid in his \"Metamorphoses\" 8, 183–235. The painting which Auden saw was thought until recently to be by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, though it is still believed to be based on a lost original of his. The painting portrays several men and a ship peacefully performing daily activities in a charming landscape. While this occurs, Icarus is visible in the bottom right hand corner of the picture, his legs splayed at absurd angles, drowning in the water. There is also a Flemish proverb (of the sort imaged in other works by Bruegel): \"And the farmer continued to plough...\" (En de boer ... hij ploegde voort\") pointing out the indifference of people to fellow men's suffering.\n\nSome years after Auden wrote this poem, William Carlos Williams wrote a poem titled \"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus\" about the same painting, and with a similar theme.\n\nThis poem and the painting \"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus\" appear side-by-side 22 minutes into the 1976 film, \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\", starring David Bowie.\n\n"}

He holds the rank of Major General.\n\nZhu is most famous for comments made at an event organized by the Better Hong Kong Foundation in July 2005. Zhu told Wall Street Journal reporter Danny Gittings (in the context of a Sino-U.S. military conflict over Taiwan), \"if the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition on to the target zone on China's territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons,\" and that \"we [...] will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all of the cities east of Xi'an. Of course the Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds ... of cities will be destroyed by the Chinese.\"\n\nGittings later wrote, \"Almost too stunned to respond, I offered Gen. Zhu a chance to back down—or at least qualify the circumstances under which China would unleash its nuclear missiles against 'hundreds of, or two hundreds' of American cities. Presumably, I suggested, he was only talking about the unlikely scenario of a U.S. attack on mainland Chinese soil. No, the general replied, a nuclear response would be justified even if it was just a conventional attack on a Chinese aircraft or warship—something very likely if Washington honored its commitment to help defend Taiwan against an invasion by Beijing. A fellow correspondent offered Gen. Zhu another escape route, reminding him that China had a longstanding policy of no first use of nuclear weapons. But the general brushed that aside as well, saying the policy could be changed and was only really intended to apply to conflicts with nonnuclear states in any case.\"\n\nBeijing has had atomic bombs since 1964 and has often stated ‘‘no first use’’ policy on nuclear weapons. Zhu is the first Chinese high-ranking military official in the past ten years to have said that China is likely to use nuclear weapons against the United States if the need arises. The explicitness of his remarks has gone beyond that of similar remarks made by Xiong Guangkai during the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1996.\n\nZhu is one of China's better-known military analysts. During the war in Kosovo in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the more recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Zhang Zhaozhong, Peng Guangqian, Luo Yuan, and Zhu often publicly discussed and analyzed the war situation at China's two major military staff colleges – the NDU and the Academy of Military Sciences. The four men were also regarded in the Western world as Chinese high-ranking military officials who had taken on a hawkish shade.\n\nThe Chinese press speculates that Zhu was transferred from the Institute for Strategic Studies (of the NDU), where he held a sensitive first-line position, to the second-line Department of Military Training for Foreigners (of the NDU), the predecessor of the Defense Affairs Institute, so that there would be less of a chance for him to express his hawkish opinions publicly. Zhu is the first Chinese general who has faced calls from the U.S. House of Representatives to be dismissed from his position.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2242167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242167", "title": "Virtual retinal display", "text": "Virtual retinal display\n\nA virtual retinal display (VRD), also known as a retinal scan display (RSD) or retinal projector (RP), is a display technology that draws a raster display (like a television) directly onto the retina of the eye. The user sees what appears to be a conventional display floating in space in front of them.\n\nIn the past similar systems have been made by projecting a defocused image directly in front of the user's eye on a small \"screen\", normally in the form of large glasses. The user focused their eyes on the background, where the screen appeared to be floating. The disadvantage of these systems was the limited area covered by the \"screen\", the high weight of the small televisions used to project the display, and the fact that the image would appear focused only if the user was focusing at a particular \"depth\". Limited brightness made them useful only in indoor settings as well.\n\nOnly recently a number of developments have made a true VRD system practical. In particular the development of high-brightness LEDs have made the displays bright enough to be used during the day, and adaptive optics have allowed systems to dynamically correct for irregularities in the eye (although this is not always needed). The result is a high-resolution screenless display with excellent color gamut and brightness, far better than the best television technologies.\n\nThe VRD was invented by Kazuo Yoshinaka of Nippon Electric Co. in 1986. Later work at the University of Washington in the Human Interface Technology Lab resulted in a similar system in 1991. Most of the research into VRDs to date has been in combination with various virtual reality systems. In this role VRDs have the potential advantage of being much smaller than existing television-based systems. They share some of the same disadvantages however, requiring some sort of optics to send the image into the eye, typically similar to the sunglasses system used with previous technologies. It also can be used as part of a wearable computer system.\nA Washington-based startup, MicroVision, Inc., has sought to commercialize VRD. Founded in 1993, MicroVision's early development work was financed by US government defense contracts and resulted in the prototype head-mounted display, Nomad.\n\nIn 2018, Intel announced Vaunt, a set of smart glasses that are designed to appear like conventional glasses, which use retinal projection via a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser and holographic grating. Intel gave up on this project, and sold the technology to North.\n\nIn the same year, QD Laser, a Japanese laser maker spun off from Fujitsu, developed the first commercialized true VRD RETISSA Display. In the following year, the firm started to sell the successor VRD RETISSA Display II which featured a higher resolution equivalent to 720p.\n\n\n"}

Kupferberg leaves no societal more unscathed in this anti-war pamphlet, which is considered one of the most notable antiwar publications. Donald L.

{"id": "2242173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242173", "title": "WBAP (AM)", "text": "WBAP (AM)\n\nWBAP (820 kHz) is an AM news/talk radio station licensed to Fort Worth, Texas and serving the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. WBAP is owned by Cumulus Media and broadcasts with 50,000 watts from a transmitter site in the northwest corner of Mansfield. It is a Class A clear-channel station, using a non-directional antenna. Its nighttime signal can often be heard throughout the Southern, Central, and Midwestern states and Northern Mexico, while its daytime signal provides at least secondary coverage from Oklahoma City to Austin. The station's studios are located in the Victory Park district in Dallas just north of downtown. WBAP is one of the oldest radio stations in Texas, dating back to 1922, when stations in Texas were still given call signs beginning with \"W\" instead of \"K.\"\n\n, WBAP remains a top-rated news/talk station.\n\nWBAP and sister station KSCS are responsible for activation of the North Texas Emergency Alert System when hazardous weather alerts, Disaster area declarations, and child abductions are issued. WBAP is also the Primary entry point for northern Texas for the EAS.\n\nWBAP began broadcasting May 2, 1922 at a wavelength of 360 meters (about 833 kHz), changing to 400 meters (750 kHz) in August 1922. The station shared time with Dallas stations WFAA and WRR. It was the first station in the United States to have an audible logo signal similar to the NBC chimes, the WBAP cowbell. According to President Herbert Hoover, the station's call letters stood for \"We Bring A Program,\" although in reality, the call letters were assigned sequentially, without any special meaning.\n\nOn May 15, 1923, the Federal Radio Commission expanded the broadcast band, and WBAP and WFAA moved to 630 kHz. Another expansion moved WBAP to 600 kHz effective April 15, 1927, and this frequency was shared with WOAI in San Antonio. On November 11, 1928, WBAP moved to 800 kHz, and on June 1, 1929, WFAA also moved to 800 kHz, sharing time (and NBC Red network affiliation) with WBAP. Station owner Amon G. Carter was unhappy with having to share time on 800 kHz with WFAA. Carter Publishing purchased KGKO in Wichita Falls (570 kHz) and moved it to Fort Worth as an affiliate of the NBC Blue network (which became ABC), and more importantly as a second frequency to be used when 800 kHz was not available. The sale was approved by the Federal Communications Commission September 24, 1935. On March 29, 1941, as a consequence of the Treaty of Havana, WBAP and WFAA moved one last time, to 820 kHz.\n\nCarter eventually sold half of KGKO to A. H. Belo, owners of WFAA and the \"Dallas Morning News\", and on April 27, 1947, KGKO was replaced by a second shared frequency between WBAP and WFAA.\n\nOn September 29, 1948, WBAP pioneered television service in Texas with the opening of the state's first video outlet, NBC affiliate WBAP-TV (channel 5).\n\nThe dual frequency sharing arrangement between WBAP and WFAA continued through the 1950s and 1960s, with the stations switching frequencies several times a day. When WBAP changed frequencies, it signaled the change with a cowbell, which became widely associated with the station. Even though the stations swapped frequencies several times each day, the network affiliations remained constant: NBC network programming stayed on 820 kHz and ABC network programming stayed on 570 kHz. This frequently proved confusing for announcers and listeners alike.\n\nOn May 1, 1970, the unique dual split-frequency lives of WBAP and WFAA ended when WBAP paid $3.5 million to WFAA in exchange for sole occupancy of 820 kHz (and the NBC affiliation). WFAA took on 570 kHz (and the ABC affiliation), but with only 5,000 watts full-time. Once the frequency-sharing with WFAA ended in 1970, both stations were free to program musical formats, and WBAP began programming country music. It also gained the added benefit of 820's clear-channel signal; previously WFAA controlled it during these prime nighttime hours.\n\nAlso around this time, the FCC began to scrutinize ownership of broadcast stations and print media in the same market with the tightening of its rules, which disallowed new radio and/or television combinations with newspapers while grandfathering existing instances. Carter Publications’ ownership of the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" and WBAP-AM-FM-TV was one of three which existed in the Dallas/Fort Worth market. However, Carter voluntarily ended the cross-ownership issue in January 1973, when it announced the sale of all its Fort Worth media interests. WBAP and its FM sister (now known as KSCS), and the \"Star-Telegram\" were packaged to Capital Cities Communications for $64.5 million; LIN Broadcasting paid $35 million to acquire WBAP-TV, whose call letters were changed to KXAS-TV. The sales became final in the summer of 1974.\n\nAfter a series of network affiliation changes in the late 1970s among WBAP, KRLD and WFAA, WBAP switched affiliations to ABC.\nWBAP changed to a news/talk format in October 1993. It was also the radio flagship radio station of the Texas Rangers.\n\nMorning show host Hal Jay recently celebrated his 25-year anniversary with WBAP by organizing a charity fund-raising event for Cook Children's Hospital (\"Hal Jay's Celebrity Roast\"). Among those who attended were Baseball Hall-of-Famer Nolan Ryan and syndicated radio talk show host Sean Hannity.\n\nOn June 12, 2007, WBAP was one of many Disney/ABC Radio stations sold to Citadel Broadcasting. That same year, WBAP transmitted iBiquity HD Radio (digital) during the daytime and when not airing sports programming, until abruptly ending the \"HD\" digital transmission in early December 2008. Because the license to broadcast digital \"HD Radio\" is perpetual, the station could resume digital broadcasts at any time.\n\nFor many years, WBAP was the flagship station for Dallas Stars hockey team, but relinquished the rights beginning in the 2009–2010 season, as on January 16, 2009, the Dallas Stars named KTCK Sportsradio 1310 The Ticket as its new flagship station for the next 5 years. Ironically, with Cumulus Media's recent acquisition of Citadel, WBAP and KTCK are now sister stations. Among the moments of when WBAP Had the stars, both Stanley Cup final runs were aired. And WBAP had the honor of broadcasting Game 6 of the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals, when the Stars clinched the Stanley Cup over Buffalo. \nSister station KPMZ (later WBAP-FM, now KTCK-FM) started simulcasting WBAP on 96.7 FM, March 15, 2010. Although broadcasting on a rimshot signal, management claimed that WBAP-FM provides \"crystal-clear FM fidelity\" for their listeners within 96.7's pre-determined coverage area.\n\nOn October 7, 2013, Cumulus announced the discontinuation of the WBAP simulcast on 96.7 FM. It switched call letters to KTCK-FM as a simulcast of the sports radio programming on KTCK (AM). Dan Bennet, the vice president/market manager of Cumulus, said he had \"seen no ratings increase since adding the FM.\" Bennett added, \"WBAP at 820 AM still covers 114 counties in the day and has been heard in up to 38 states at night and early morning before the sun comes up. WBAP at 820 is one of the biggest radio signals in America.\" The WBAP simulcast has moved to KPLX 99.5 HD2 (HD Radio needed), formerly The Ticket's radio spot.\n\nWBAP airs both local and nationally syndicated shows on weekdays. The day begins with the \"WBAP Morning News\" followed by Chris Salcedo mid-mornings, Rick Roberts in the afternoon and Chris Krok evenings. Most syndicated shows come from the co-owned Westwood One Network: Mark Levin, \"Red Eye Radio\" and on weekends John Batchelor, Bob Brinker and Larry Kudlow. From Premiere Networks WBAP carries Rush Limbaugh. Weekends include shows on money, cars, home improvement, real estate and the outdoors. Brokered programming also airs. Most hours on weekdays start with local news at the top of the hour while nights and weekends, Westwood One News is heard.\n\nOvernights are locally originated as WBAP is the flagship station of the nationally syndicated \"Red Eye Radio\" (formerly \"Midnight Trucking Radio Network\"), a trucking show that traces its roots to Bill Mack's overnight show back in 1969. Hosts Eric Harley and Gary McNamara are heard live locally weeknights, with \"Best Of\" programs heard weekend overnights.\n\nPrior to Citadel's takeover of the station in August 2007, talk show host Mark Davis's show was a full three hours, (9 A.M. to Noon). As a result, Limbaugh, Hannity and Levin were all forced to air on a one-hour tape delay. However, with Citadel's assumption of the station, Davis's show was both cut in length and shifted back by a half-hour, to carry the top-rated talkers live.

{"id": "2242223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242223", "title": "Bitap algorithm", "text": "Bitap algorithm\n\nThe bitap algorithm (also known as the shift-or, shift-and or Baeza-Yates–Gonnet algorithm) is an approximate string matching algorithm. The algorithm tells whether a given text contains a substring which is \"approximately equal\" to a given pattern, where approximate equality is defined in terms of Levenshtein distance if the substring and pattern are within a given distance \"k\" of each other, then the algorithm considers them equal. The algorithm begins by precomputing a set of bitmasks containing one bit for each element of the pattern. Then it is able to do most of the work with bitwise operations, which are extremely fast.\n\nThe bitap algorithm is perhaps best known as one of the underlying algorithms of the Unix utility agrep, written by Udi Manber, Sun Wu, and Burra Gopal. Manber and Wu's original paper gives extensions of the algorithm to deal with fuzzy matching of general regular expressions.\n\nDue to the data structures required by the algorithm, it performs best on patterns less than a constant length (typically the word length of the machine in question), and also prefers inputs over a small alphabet. Once it has been implemented for a given alphabet and word length \"m\", however, its running time is completely predictableit runs in O(\"mn\") operations, no matter the structure of the text or the pattern.\n\nThe bitap algorithm for exact string searching was invented by Bálint Dömölki in 1964 and extended by R. K. Shyamasundar in 1977, before being reinvented by Ricardo Baeza-Yates and Gaston Gonnet in 1989 (one chapter of first author's PhD thesis) which also extended it to handle classes of characters, wildcards, and mismatches. In 1991, it was extended by Manber and Wu to handle also insertions and deletions (full fuzzy string searching). This algorithm was later improved by Baeza-Yates and Navarro in 1996 and later by Gene Myers for long patterns in 1998.\n\nThe bitap algorithm for exact string searching, in full generality, looks like this in pseudocode:\n\nBitap distinguishes itself from other well-known string searching algorithms in its natural mapping onto simple bitwise operations, as in the following modification of the above program. Notice that in this implementation, counterintuitively, each bit with value zero indicates a match, and each bit with value 1 indicates a non-match. The same algorithm can be written with the intuitive semantics for 0 and 1, but in that case we must introduce another instruction into the inner loop to set codice_1. In this implementation, we take advantage of the fact that left-shifting a value shifts in zeros on the right, which is precisely the behavior we need.\n\nNotice also that we require codice_2 additional bitmasks in order to convert the codice_3 condition in the general implementation into bitwise operations. Therefore, the bitap algorithm performs better when applied to inputs over smaller alphabets.\n\nTo perform fuzzy string searching using the bitap algorithm, it is necessary to extend the bit array \"R\" into a second dimension. Instead of having a single array \"R\" that changes over the length of the text, we now have \"k\" distinct arrays \"R\". Array \"R\" holds a representation of the prefixes of \"pattern\" that match any suffix of the current string with \"i\" or fewer errors. In this context, an \"error\" may be an insertion, deletion, or substitution; see Levenshtein distance for more information on these operations.\n\nThe implementation below performs fuzzy matching (returning the first match with up to \"k\" errors) using the fuzzy bitap algorithm. However, it only pays attention to substitutions, not to insertions or deletionsin other words, a Hamming distance of \"k\". As before, the semantics of 0 and 1 are reversed from their conventional meanings.\n\n"}

He was a member of the Commission on the Union before 1707 but acted as an informant to his Jacobite colleagues and later wrote an anonymous memoir of its dealings. He supported the Pretender in the Jacobite rebellion.\n\nLockhart was the son of Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath and his second wife Philadelphia Wharton, daughter of Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton and sister of Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton one of the leaders of the Whig Junta. After his father’s death, Lockhart succeeded to a sizable estate at the age of eight years. His Whiggish guardians removed his tutor, John Gillane, the family’s episcopalian chaplain. His education was placed in the hands of Presbyterian tutors who also tutored John Campbell. Lockhart and Argyll became friends as children, and remained friends into adulthood despite political differences. Campbell became one of Scotland's leading Whigs, while Lockhart came to have a profound dislike of Presbyterianism . By 1695 he had obtained the appointment of episcopalian guardians and had begun to manage his own financial affairs. He developed the estate and exploited the coal reserves to become one of the wealthiest of Scottish commoners, and gathered a major electoral interest in Lanarkshire and Midlothian. He married Lady Euphemia Montgomerie (d. 1738), daughter of a leading Episcopalian peer Alexander Montgomerie, 9th Earl of Eglintoun on 30 April 1697.\n\nIn 1702, Lockhart becameShire Commissioner for the shire of Edinburgh in the Parliament of Scotland. He joined the cavalier wing of the Country party. He was made a privy councillor in 1703 as part of the Court’s attempt to woo the cavaliers. He was attracted to a political alliance in the hope of achieving legal toleration for Episcopalians but as this was not forthcoming, he went into opposition, and remained disaffected with the Court for the rest of his time in the Scottish parliament. He denounced the defection from the Country party of the so-called ‘New Party’ (later Squadrone) in 1704. He had a close connection with the Duke of Hamilton, although he was frustrated at the Duke’s unwillingness to pursue Jacobite objectives. After he voted for Hamilton’s motion for deferring a decision on the succession, he was removed from the privy council in December 1704. In 1705, to his annoyance, he was appointed a commissioner for arranging the union with England apparently through the influence of Wharton. Initially he decided not to accept the post, but was persuaded by Jacobite colleagues that it would be useful for him to report back to them on the proceedings. He avoided signing the treaty, and in Parliament became one of the most vigorous opponents of the Union. Although he had some support for the article on communication of trade, he usually voted with the opposition, and abstained from voting on ratification.\n\nAfter the union Lockhart was not one of the but he decided to seek election to Westminster to serve the Jacobite cause, and to distract the ministry from suspicion about the intended invasion. He gave his interest in Lanarkshire to Lord Archibald Hamilton and was returned as Member of Parliament for Edinburgh. He was also returned for Wigtown burghs where he stood as an insurance. In 1713 he took part in an abortive movement aiming at the repeal of the union. He was deeply implicated in the rising of 1715, the preparations for which he assisted at Carnwath and at Dryden, his Edinburgh residence. He was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, but probably, through the favour of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, he was released without being brought to trial; but his brother Philip was taken prisoner at the Battle of Preston and condemned to be shot, the sentence being executed on 2 December 1715. Lockhart continued to act on behalf of James III; his letters were intercepted by the government in 1727 but he was warned of his imminent arrest by Charles Erskine, a senior government legal officer and managed to escape to the Continent. Argyll's influence was again exerted in Lockhart's behalf, and in 1728 he was permitted to return to Scotland, where he lived in retirement till his death in a duel on 17 December 1731.\n\nThe \"Lockhart Papers\" are a significant authority for the history of the Jacobites. Lockhart was the author of \"Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland\", dealing with the reign of Queen Anne up to the union with England, first published in 1714. These \"Memoirs\", together with Lockhart's correspondence with the Pretender, and some other papers of minor importance, were published again in the two volumes of \"Lockhart Letters\" (1817), edited by Anthony Aufrere.\n\nLockart was the source of intelligence revealing the extensive bribery of Scottish parliamentarians prior to the Treaty of Union, giving rise to the famous Robert Burns line: \"\"bought and sold for English gold\".\" He published a list of bribes paid by the English Treasury.\n\nLockhart belonged to the Lockharts of Lee, who were active in Scots law and politics during the 17th century. He married Eupheme Montgomerie, daughter of Alexander Montgomerie, 9th Earl of Eglinton, by whom he had a large family.\n\nHis son was Alexander Lockhart, Lord Covington\n\nHis daughter Grace Lockhart married John Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aboyne.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2242228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242228", "title": "Periyar (river)", "text": "Periyar (river)\n\nPeriyar (meaning: \"big river\") is the longest river and the river with the largest discharge potential in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the few perennial rivers in the region and provides drinking water for several major towns. The Periyar is of utmost significance to the economy of Kerala. It generates a significant proportion of Kerala's electrical power via the Idukki Dam and flows along a region of industrial and commercial activity. The river also provides water for irrigation and domestic use throughout its course besides supporting a rich fishery. Due to these reasons, the river has been named the \"Lifeline of Kerala\". Kochi city, in the vicinity of the river mouth draws its water supply from Aluva, an upstream site sufficiently free of seawater intrusion. Twenty five percent of Kerala's industries are along the banks of river Periyar. These are mostly crowded within a stretch of in the Eloor-Edayar region (Udhyogamandal), about north of Kochi harbor.\n\n The Periyar has a total length of approximately and a catchment area of , of which is in Kerala and is in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe source of the Periyar lies high in the Western Ghats. It is variously claimed to be located in Kerala and in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. The state of Kerala has asserted during the hearings on the Mullaperiyar issue in the Supreme Court of India that the Periyar originates in Kerala, flows entirely through Kerala and joins the sea in the Kerala. This has also been admitted by the state of Tamil Nadu in the court. The source of the river lies in the remote forests of the Periyar Tiger Reserve. Various sources indicate the origin of the river to be Chokkampatti Mala, a peak on the southern boundary of the Periyar Tiger Reserve.\n\nThere are alternate claims for a Tamil Nadu origin, indicating that the Periyar originates in the Sivagiri peaks of Sundaramala, Tamil Nadu. However, the Supreme Court of India in its judgement on the Mullaperiyar issue in 2014, made it clear that Tamil Nadu is not a riparian state of the river Periyar but the river itself is an inter-State river.\n\nIn its early course, the river flows in a narrow north sloping valley starting from the Chokkampatti hills and extending north about , with a number of sharp lateral ridges running down to it from east and west. After flowing from its origin and on reaching Mount Plateau at its eastern end, it is joined by the west-flowing Mullayar—an important tributary—at Mullakudy. During this journey the Periyar traverses through the Periyar Tiger Reserve, flowing across or forming the boundaries between various sections of the reserve. Going downstream, it defines a part of the border between Periyar section of the reserve in the east and Sundaramala section in the west and then the borders between Moolavaigai and Thannikudy sections in the east and Ummikuppan, Mlappara and Aruvioda sections in the west before reaching the Periyar Lake.\n\nThe Mullaperiyar dam is constructed at the confluence of the Periyar and Mullayar to create the Periyar Thekkady lake and reservoir, as well as the Periyar National Park. The area belonging to Tamil Nadu in the Periyar basin is located far down the river from the Mullaperiyar Dam site. This area is drained by the tributary Nirar, which is diverted to Tamil Nadu as a part of inter-state Parambikulam-Aliyar Project (PAP) agreement.\n\nFrom Periyar Thekkady lake and reservoir, some water is diverted eastwards to Tamil Nadu via a tunnel. The diverted water, after power generation, is let into the Suruliar river (a tributary of the Vaigai River) thereby resulting in an inter-basin transfer of water. Downstream of the Mullaperiyar dam, the Periyar continues to flow northwestward for , exiting the Periyar Tiger Reserve and passing through Vandiperiyar, Elappara and Ayyappancoil to the Idukki reservoir formed by the Idukki, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu dams. The Idukki dam is constructed across the Periyar river on the famous Idukki gorge formed by the Kuravan and Kurathi hills.\n\nThe main Periyar below the Idukki reservoir flows due north parallel to the western edge of the Idukki plateau and is joined by the Perinjakutty from the east and Muthirapuzha from the north. After the confluence with Muthirapuzha, the river flows northwestwards and enters Ernakulam district at Neriamangalam. It is joined by its major tributary, the Idamalayar, upstream of the Bhoothathankettu barrage. After receiving the waters of the Idamalayar river, the Periyar flows west along the midlands of Ernakulam district.\n\nAt Aluva, the river bifurcates into the Marthandavarma and the Mangalapuzha branches. The Mangalapuzha branch joins Chalakudy River and empties into the Lakshadweep Sea at Munambam, and the Marthandavarma branch flows southwards, again dividing into two near Kunjunnikkara island, going through the Udhyogamandal area and finally draining into the Cochin backwater system (part of Vembanad Lake) at Varappuzha. The Vembanad backwaters are connected to the Lakshadweep Sea at Cochin and Kodungallur.\n\nIts major tributaries are:\n\nMinor tributaries are:\nMuthayar, Perunthuraiar, Chinnar, Cheruthony, Kattappanayar\n\nAlthough the Chalakudy river in strict geological sense is a tributary of the Periyar, for all practical purposes it is treated as a separate river by Government and other agencies. Chalakudy river itself has a catchment area of , with in Kerala and in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe Periyar basin spreads over an area of , most of it in central Kerala. It lies between latitudes 9°15’30\"N and 10°21’00\"N and longitudes 76°08’38\"E and 77°24’32\"E. The river drains parts of Idukki, Ernakulam and Thrissur districts in Kerala and Coimbatore district in Tamil Nadu. The basin has an inverted \"L\" shape with a maximum width at the intersection. The length-width ratio is 6:1. Most of the streams flow in deep gorges with steep valleys along the highlands of the basin. Coming out of the hills, the Periyar flows west and its basin occupies the northern part of Ernakulam district, covering the region from Neriamangalam through Aluva to Varapuzha and Munambam.\n\nThe Periyar is an 8th order stream with considerable development of tributary network. The average drainage density of the basin is 2.46 km/ km with a total number of first order streams of 15,773. The total stream length inclusive of all orders in the basin is . The river originates from the high hills of the Western Ghats and the influence of tectonism can be evidenced from the stream pattern and presence of structural valleys. Forests occupy nearly (28%) of the basin area whereas cardamom and settlement with mixed tree crops occupy an area of and respectively. The basin is ecologically sensitive. Nearly 80% of the total area situated in the high ranges are susceptible to erosion and mass movements.\n\nAnamudi, at the highest peak in South India, is the highest point in the basin.\n\nThe upper part of the Periyar basin extends across the Cardamom Hills. In the north, these hills extend up to the high Munnar saddle running east to Chokkanad Mala and further on to Kolukkumala on the eastern edge of the Ghats. In the south, the hills reach up to the westerly spur at Chokkampatti Mala. This section of the basin is divided into three parts.\n\nThe southernmost part of the Cardamom Hills i.e. the source of Periyar River is a narrow valley extending south of Kumily. This is the southern extreme of the Periyar basin. It is less than wide and is about long. The upper catchments of Periyar extend as a wedge deep into the northeastern corner of the neighboring Pandalam Hills. This section of the Cardamom Hills extends deep into but is clearly separated from the Pandalam Hills. The main Western Ghats watershed line forming the eastern border of the Cardamom Hills is highest to the southeast of the Kumily Gap. Here the High Wavies branch off towards north-west into Tamil Nadu, with some peaks reaching elevations of over along the border between Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Further south, the ridge along the watershed line is heavily forested. This part of the Cardamom Hills is called the Sivagiri Range and it extends south up to Chokkampatti Mala which is at the junction of Pamba and Periyar River basins. The southern boundary of the Cardamom Hills runs along a westerly spur hill starting from the Chokkampatti Mala which initially runs north and then turns northwest almost parallel to the Sivagiri Range. This ridge separates the basin of Pamba from Periyar. From its source near Chokkampatti Mala initially Periyar flows north between these two heavily forested ridges. The valley floor is at an elevation of and the ridges on either side often reach . This valley of Periyar at its source and the valley of Kunthi River in the Silent Valley are the only two forested higher valleys in the Western Ghats left intact even now. The Periyar Tiger Reserve is mostly within this southernmost part of the Cardamom Hills.\n\nA poorly defined ridge that runs from near Chakkupallam (north of Kumily) on the border between Kerala and Tamil Nadu extending southwest to near Vallakkadavu segregates the upper reaches of Periyar from the rest of the Cardamom Hills. Immediately downstream of Mullaperiyar dam, Periyar cuts through this ridge. North of this ridge, the Cardamom Hills extend up to the high Munnar saddle. Here, east of the river channel, the undulating plateau rises up to the watershed line of the Western Ghats. This section drains into the Periyar through the Perinjankutty Ar and the drainage channel is essentially from south-east to north-west. This portion of the Cardamom Hills is on an average high. The northern edge of the Cardamom Hills bordering the High Range Plateau on the other hand slopes steeply to the south and is drained by Panniyar. The Panniyar joins the Muthirapuzha, which drains the High Range Plateau section of the Periyar Basin in the north. The crestline of the Cardamom Hills in this section along the border with Theni and Kambam, in comparison with the rest of the main watershed line of the Cardamom Hills and the High Ranges, is low, reaching up to only about . East of Chakkupallom, a small part of the adjacent Vaigai basin protrudes from Tamil Nadu into Kerala in this section. This portion of the Periyar basin is drier than all other west sloping parts of the Western Ghats. It has no significant extent of natural forests remaining anywhere. At the turn of the 20th century, it was fully covered by evergreen forests.\n\nThe portion west of the main Periyar channel which flows from south to north here, is the true Idukki sub-plateau. This is the lowest part of the Cardamom Hills sloping towards the north in which the Idukki reservoir is located. It is separated from the rest of the Cardamom Hills by the deep channel of the Periyar River. The sub-plateau extends north from near Ayyappankoil to near Neriamangalam. Its western border is the clearly demarcated scarp face of the Ghats descending to the plains of Thodupuzha. This high western crestline separates the Periyar catchment from the Manimala, Meenachil and Moovattupuzha drainage basins. It ends in the north along the channel of Periyar from Neriamangalam to Panamkutty. The catchment of Kattappana Ar located beyond the southeastern corner of the Idukki reservoir also falls in this portion. A southwest to northeast ridge called the Chekuthan Mala separates the Idukki Sub-plateau from the Peermade Plateau as well as the main mass of Cardamom Hills. Its eastern boundary is a northwest to southeast ridge separating the Idukki reservoir from the Kallar/Perinjankutty tributary of Periyar which drains the main Cardamom Hills. The Idukki Subplateau is at an average elevation of . This area was heavily forested till the 1950s but now only three small fragments of forest vegetation alone remain. The largest is within the Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary. South of Vagamon, the tributaries of Meenachil, Manimala and Pamba have eroded away extensive areas of the Periyar basin between Ayyappankovil and Vallakkadavu. The Periyar only has a narrow strip of the Cardamom Hill tableland to flow northward here.\n\nThe High Range Plateau is located around Munnar and Devikulam. It has an average elevation of about and drains to the south through Muthirapuzha into Periyar. The high Rajamala-Anamudi-Umayamala part of the main Anamalai ridge forms its northern boundary. A spur ridge starting from the main Anamalai ridge, going south immediately to the west of Munnar and continuing on to Parvathi Mala forms the western boundary of the High Range Plateau. This ridge separates the High Ranges from the Lower Periyar Valleys further to the west. The eastern edge of the High Range plateau runs north from Kolukkumala, at the junction of the High Range Plateau with the Cardamom Hills, and continues onto the Top Station along the border between Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The High Range portion is essentially the south and west draining slopes of the main Anamalai ridge with the Cardamom Hills located to its south. All the northern slopes of the main Anamalai ridge falling within Kerala drain into Idamalayar and Pooyamkutty Ar, both tributaries of Periyar.\n\nThe High Range Plateau has been almost totally transformed by tea plantations and hydroelectric dams. The original forest was mostly of the Shola-Grassland type. From the biodiversity value, this unit is of special importance because of its specialized high altitude flora and fauna.\n\nThe lower valleys of Idamalayar and Pooyamkutty Ar constitute the Lower Periyar Valleys. The exceedingly violent impact of very heavy rainfall on a likely geologically unstable part of the Western Ghats where there is extensive faulting has caused accelerated weathering and erosion, carving out a complex of deep valleys on the western face of the High Range Plateau. This topographically complex segment of the Western Ghats extends from near Neriamangalam in the southwest to Panamkutty in the southeast along the Periyar River and continues north up to the watershed divide between the Periyar and the Chalakudy Basins. Its eastern border is the main Anamalai ridge. This section of western slope of the Western Ghats is deeply dissected and has geographical as well as ecological characteristics found nowhere in the Western Ghats. To the south of this section is the Idukki sub-plateau and to the southeast, the Cardamom Hills. The western edge of Panniyar and Muthirapuzha Basins form the eastern border of this section. The Parvathimudi-Umayamala ridge forms the northeastern corner of the Lower Periyar Valleys.\n\nTowards north, the Lower Periyar Valleys and the Periyar Basin extend up to the Idamala gorge cut by Periyar’s northernmost tributary – Idamalayar. The basin is bounded in the north by the ridge separating Sholayar from the Idamala River. This ridge is a spur hill extending from near Valaparai in Tamil Nadu, projecting far west into Kerala. The Idamala gorge separates the Sholayar forests in the Nelliyampathies towards the north from the southern Anamudi Reserved Forest and High Range Plateau. The area belonging to Tamil Nadu in the Periyar basin is situated here. This area forms the north-eastern corner of the Periyar basin. It is drained by the tributary Nirar, which runs in a South Westerly Direction and falls into Idamalayar. Within this section there are a series of deep west-sloping valleys where the valley floors are often at elevations less than . Separating these valleys are a jumble of steep hills and flat topped plateaux with scarp faces rearing up to elevations of around . The Idamala and Pooyamkutty rivers drain most of this section while its southern edge drains into the main Periyar. This tract is almost entirely forested and the forests extend northwest between Periyar and Chalakudy rivers along the plains almost up to Kalady.\n\nTo the west of the Lower Periyar Valleys are the midlands, which are characterized by undulating topography with small hills separated by valleys. The general gradient is towards the west here. The lowlands occur as a narrow belt almost parallel to the present shoreline. The landforms of this section are broad valleys, submerged lands with swamps and marshes and subdued sand dunes. Many parts of the area are directly connected to the backwaters with a network of canals. The river bifurcates near Aluva into two major distributaries; one continues to flow through Desam as Mangalappuzha and finally drains into the Lakshadweep Sea. The Chalakudy river also joins to this branch of the Periyar south-east of Kodungalloor which expands to its maximum width at Munambam. The Marthandavarma branch flows southwards, again dividing into two near Kunjunnikkara Island, and finally drains into the Vembanad backwaters at Varapuzha. The most industrialized zone of Periyar lies in this part of the basin between Angamaly and Cochin, with over 50 large and medium scale industries. The Edayar branch of Periyar caters to the needs of these industries.\n\nThe Idukki Dam is the largest hydro-electric project in Kerala and lies on the Periyar. It is the biggest dam of its kind (a concrete, double curvature parabolic, thin arc dam) in Asia and the second-biggest in the world. Its generators have a power output of 780 MW (), and generate electricity through the underground facility at Moolamattam, built by an India-Canada joint venture. Power generation at Idukki is minimal during the monsoon. The dam also permits storage of water for the dry summer period when many other reservoirs in the area are low. Since the commissioning of the Idukki project in 1976, tail-race water (between 19.83-78.5 m/s) has been diverted from the Idukki reservoir through the Moolamattom power station into the Thodupuzha tributary of the Muvattupuzha river.\n\nThere are other hydro-electric generation facilities on the river at Pallivasal, Chenkulam, Panniyar, Neriyamangalam and Lower Periyar.\n\nThe important reservoirs in the Periyar basin within Kerala are Bhoothathankettu, Idamalayar, Lower Periyar, Mattupetty, Anayirangal, Kundala, Ponmudi, Kallarkutti, Idukki (formed by construction of three dams—Idukki, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu), Sengulam, Kallar, Erattayar and Mullaperiyar. The dams falling within Tamil Nadu in the Periyar basin are the Upper Nirar Weir and the Lower Nirar Dam. These dams help divert water from the Nirar tributary of Periyar to the adjacent Sholayar basin.\n\nThe Periyar valley Irrigation project in Ernakulam district envisages the utilization of the tail race discharge from the completed Hydel scheme in the Muthirapuzha tributary of river Periyar together with the controlled release from Ennackal dam constructed by Kerala State Electricity Board under Hydel scheme across the Idamalayar tributary and the dependable run off from the uncontrolled catchment of Periyar river, for irrigating an area of of land lying on the left bank of Periyar river through a network of canal system and controlling devices. The scheme consists of the Periyar Barrage at Bhoothathankettu with a catchment area of along with a network of canals.\n\nApart from irrigation on left bank of Periyar, the project also enables a supply of minimum quantity of water through the river to check the intrusion of salinity at lower reaches of the river as well as to meet the requirements of many lift irrigation schemes of river Periyar. Supply of water for drinking and industrial purposes are met by a portion of storage water by the barrage of Bhoothathankettu.\n\nMullaperiyar dam was one of the earliest instances of inter-basin transfers in the peninsular India. While it met the demand for water on one hand, it led to the deterioration of water quality downstream of the river. Salinity intrusion and pollution dispersion problems arose in the lower reaches of the Periyar due to non-availability of sufficient quantity of water for flushing. Another inter-basin transfer from the Periyar to the Muvattupuzha river due to the Idukki project has further adversely affected the downstream flow in the Periyar river.\n\nThe Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP) agreement was conceived to harness and share the waters in the inter-State rivers in Bharathappuzha, Chalakkudypuzha and Periyar basins. Nirar and Anamalayar, tributaries of Periyar are covered under this agreement. Water from these rivers are transferred to the adjacent Sholayar basin as part of the PAP agreement.\n\nDue to all the diversions in its basin, the Periyar has lost 22 per cent of its average flow.\n\nSouth of the Mullaperiyar reservoir, at the source of Periyar River, there is an unbroken stretch of about of sheltered, unmodified rainforests within the Periyar Tiger Reserve. These rainforests extend further west into the adjacent Pamba basin within the Gudarakal Forest Range and continue south beyond the Gudarakal Range into the forests of the Achankovil Division. This entire stretch contains about of undisturbed wet evergreen forests typical of the Western Ghats. The forests on the upper reaches of Periyar are mostly inaccessible and is one of the least disturbed evergreen forests left in the Western Ghats.\n\nThe Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) is also one of the most ecologically diverse regions in India. The flora of the reserve is very rich and diverse. Out of the estimated 3,800 species of angiosperms of Kerala, 1,966 have been reported from within the reserve. Nowhere in the subcontinent, has such a large number of taxa been reported from an area comparable to that of the PTR. Apart from this, the reserve also contains an estimated 323 species of birds, 38 species of fish and 44 species of reptiles.\n\nThe Periyar plateau forms a part of the Project Elephant Reserve 10, which also includes the Agasthyamalai-Mahendragiri hills. The landscape on the Periyar Plateau portion of Elephant Reserve 10 maintains the most intact elephant range in Southern India. This area is believed to harbour about 2,000 elephants and is one of the potential landscapes for the long-term conservation of the species. This population is genetically more diverse and distinct from the much larger elephant population further north in the Ghats. This region is also known for its rich biodiversity. On the other hand, the landscape has also witnessed a variety of developmental activities including commercial plantations, hydroelectric and irrigation projects and other forms of infrastructural development that impede the movement of elephants.\n\nThattekad Bird Sanctuary, one of the important bird sanctuaries of India, is an evergreen low-land forest located between the branches of Periyar River. It has a rich and varied birdlife. Several species of birds, both forest birds as well as the water birds visit the sanctuary. Dr. Salim Ali, India's greatest ornithologist, once described this tiny, bird sanctuary, located about north-east of Kochi, as \"The richest bird habitat in peninsular India\".\n\nPeriyar is one of the six major rivers flowing into the Vembanad lake. Vembanad Kol Wetland was included in the list of wetlands of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar Convention for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. It is home to more than 20,000 waterfowls—the third largest such population in India.\n\nThere are several places of religious significance along the banks of the Periyar. The famous Aluva Sivarathri festival is celebrated on the banks of the Periyar River in Aluva. The temple festival is conducted every year on Sivarathri day of the Kumbham month of Malayalam calendar. The Siva temple on the sand bank of Periyar River throngs with devotees every year on Mahasivarathri day.\n\nKalady is a town located on the banks of the Periyar river. It is the birthplace of Sri Adi Shankara, the Hindu philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta. Kalady started featuring in the spiritual map of India only after its rediscovery in the late 19th century by the then Shankaracharya of Sringeri and the subsequent consecration of a temple for Sri Adi Shankara in 1910.\n\nLocated from Kochi, the Malayatoor Church is situated atop the high Malayatoor Hill. The church is dedicated to St. Thomas, who is believed to have prayed at this shrine. One of the most important Christian pilgrim centres in Kerala, this holy shrine attracts devotees in very large numbers not only from Kerala but also from the neighbouring states. This famous church is situated at Kurisumudi, a verdant hill in the Western Ghats girdled partially by the Periyar (river). The Church has a life-size statue of St. Thomas and the imprint of the feet of the Apostle on a rock. This shrine has now been accorded an international pilgrimage station.\n\nThe town of Kodungallur lying close to the Periyar river is famous for the Cheraman Juma Masjid. The tradition holds that the mosque, built in 629 AD by Mālik bin Dīnār, is the oldest mosque in India and the second oldest mosque in the world to offer Jumu'ah prayers. Constructed during the lifetime of Muhammad, the bodies of some of his original followers are said to be buried there. Unlike other mosques in the region that face westwards this mosque faces east.\n\nThe lower reaches of the Periyar are heavily polluted. Industries in the Eloor industrial zone discharge waste into the river. Greenpeace India describes the lower Periyar as \"a cesspool of toxins, which have alarming levels of deadly poisons like DDT, endosulfan, hexa and trivalent chromium, lead, cyanide, BHC\". Several studies have pointed out that the riverbed has deposits of heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, chromium, nickel, cobalt and zinc and the ecosystem of the river has many dead zones. Some of the major recommendations are ensuring zero effluent discharge from the industrial units in the Eloor-Edayar stretch and zero emission from companies. Pollution of the river and surrounding wetlands has almost wiped out traditional occupations, including fishing and farming.\n\nIllegal sand mining from the Periyar is another major environmental issue. Studies have pointed out that the quantity of sand being mined from the Periyar is at least 30 times the actual quantity that can be taken out without causing damage to the river’s environmental system. In the Periyar river basin, land sand mining is widespread in the plateau region in the highlands. Mining of sands from these areas impose severe environmental problems to the river basin environment.\n\nEfforts have been made to prevent soil erosion on the banks of river periyar at Aluva Sivarathri manappuram (sand bank) through afforestation programs headed by renowned environmentalist, Prof. S. Sitaraman, since 1992. The Aluva Environmental Protection Forum started by Sitaraman and others have played a pivotal role in the prevention of illegal sand mining and water pollution in the lower reaches of the river.\n\nThe control and safety of the Mullaperiyar dam on the river and the validity and fairness of the corresponding lease agreement have been points of dispute between Kerala and Tamil Nadu states. Intertwined with this, there is a dispute as to whether the Periyar should be classified as an inter-state river or not. Kerala states that the Periyar is an intrastate river since no part of it flows through Tamil Nadu. The river originates in Kerala, flows entirely through Kerala and joins the Arabian Sea in the Kerala. Although these facts have been admitted by Tamil Nadu, it counters that the Periyar should be considered an inter-state river since a part of the catchment of the river lies in Tamil Nadu. It has also cited a 1950 report signed by the then Kerala state irrigation minister V R Krishna Iyer recording that Periyar is an inter-state river since some of its drainage area lay in Madras state. Essentially, the dispute over the status of the river comes down to the definition of an inter-state river, with Kerala supporting the definition to be according to the course of the river, while Tamil Nadu favouring the definition to be according to the catchment area of the river.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India, in its verdict on 7 May 2014, stated that although the Periyar rises in and traverses only in the territory of Kerala before entering into Arabian sea, no part of the land in Tamil Nadu abuts river Periyar and that Tamil Nadu is not a riparian state of the Periyar river, the fact that a small part of the Periyar river basin lies in Tamil Nadu is enough to make the river interstate in nature.\n\n"}
{"id": "2242229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242229", "title": "MotorStorm (video game)", "text": "MotorStorm (video game)\n\nMotorStorm is a 2006 racing video game developed by Evolution Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the Sony PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system. Announced at E3 2005, the game was released in Japan on 14 December 2006 and worldwide in March 2007. \"MotorStorm\" has sold over 3 million copies. Two sequels were made, \"\" in 2008, and \"\" in 2011. Another game was also created, \"\", for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. As of January 2012, the online multiplayer servers for the game have been permanently shut down.\n\nThe events of the game take place at the fictional MotorStorm Festival in Monument Valley. The objective of the game is to win a series of off-road races and to be the overall winner of the Festival. \"MotorStorm\" holds the Guinness World Record for the biggest variety of vehicles in a racing game - players are in control of seven different types of vehicles throughout the game: bikes, ATVs, buggies, rally cars, racing trucks, mudpluggers and big rigs. Each vehicle has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, dirt bikes are capable of accelerating very fast and capable of maneuvering through tight spaces, but they are also easily damaged, and only reach mediocre top speeds. On the other hand, big rigs have great durability, medium speed, but poor acceleration and handling.\n\nEach race requires the player to choose a particular vehicle type and often race against many of the other vehicles. Every track has many different ways of getting through it, each catering to a specific class of vehicle thereby making the racing field more even. The events in the game occur in real-time, such as the mud effects, tire marks, and crashes (for example, if a car loses a wheel, it will remain where it lands for the duration of the race). Each track is filled with a variety of jumps, bumps, cliffs, ledges, mud pits, parts from other cars, and other obstacles. Races are generally three-lap events with two to fifteen racers. There are nine playable tracks in the game with a further four are available to purchase as downloadable content through the PlayStation Store.\n\nTracks experience real-time deformation, which means each lap is different from the last; obstacles and other elements that are displaced from their original position will remain that way unless disturbed again. Larger vehicles can create large holes or leave ruts that can easily upset smaller, lighter vehicles, and every vehicle responds in different ways to different track environments. Vehicles like big rigs and mudpluggers get excellent traction in mud, whereas lighter vehicles like dirt bikes and ATVs will slip and slide.\n\nNitrous boost plays a large part in \"MotorStorm\" and is used to either catch up to opponents or pull away from them. Players must keep an eye on their boost meter, which shows how hot the car's engine is. The longer the boost is held, the hotter the engine becomes. If the boost is held when the engine reaches its critical temperature, it will explode. Since explosions resulting from the boost typically rocket the player's vehicle forward, they can be used to edge out another racer across the finish line. This can be very useful when behind, although this does not work all of the time if the AI opponent gains the upper hand.\n\nIn online play, Catch-up mode can be enabled. This means the leader of a race has less boost than everyone else, allowing players further back in the field to \"catch-up\". If the leader changes, so does the racer with less boost. This makes using boost for the leader a technical task, in theory they should only use it when necessary, and relying on their individual driving skills to win them the race.\n\nEarly details released by Sony and Evolution Studios show high-quality rendered video sequences. Many gaming enthusiasts and members of the press became sceptical as to the source of the material shown, with most people suspecting the footage to be pre-rendered as opposed to real-time in-game footage.\n\nIn March 2006, shortly following the Game Developers Conference, leaked footage of a tech demo was spread across the Internet on sites such as YouTube. The demo shows a yellow buggy and a motorbike both cutting through mud, as well as splashing the mud onto a white truck, and shows violent crashes, such as a bike landing on a purple rally car, causing it to spin out, and a white mud plugger ramming through the yellow buggy, causing it to get crushed by rolling over and crossing through flames and crashing into the guardrail. Being a technical demo, it did not show any gameplay aspects or whether the final game would reach the standard of the E3 2005 video. However, Sony representative Phil Harrison mentioned it would make an appearance at E3 2006.\n\nThe game appeared at E3 2006, although it missed the first day of the expo due to the show versions being completed and uploaded to LA that day. The build at the show was only 50% complete but still showed some effects such as motion blur and track deformation.\n\nTwo demo versions of the game have been made available to the public. The first is only available on PlayStation 3 retail kiosks, while the second is only available for download from the PlayStation Store. While both demos feature the same track, the kiosk demo allows the player to switch vehicles on the grid before the race starts, which means that the player is able to race in approximately twenty different vehicles, while the downloadable demo restricts players to two vehicles. However, the downloadable demo has a smoother frame rate and extra visual detail.\n\nBoth demos allow the player to steer using Sixaxis motion-sensing.\n\nOn 15 June 2007 in Europe\nand 21 June in North America, an add-on was made available on the PlayStation Network. This free download, when used in conjunction with the 1.2 update, unlocks a time-trial mode. In this mode, players are able to select a track and vehicle to race around and achieve the best time. When online, players can upload their best times to see where they rank in a global leaderboard. There is also the ability to download the \"ghosts\" of best laps of other players—including the creators—and race against them.\n\nOn 6 September 2007 in Europe, a second add-on was made available for purchase on the PlayStation Network, called the Coyote Revenge Weekend VIP Pass (named Revenge Weekend in North America). This download, when used in conjunction with the 2.0 update, unlocks the Coyote Weekend mode. This allows players to access an additional three tickets, combining nine races (four races each in the first and second tickets and one final race in the third ticket). The races unlock sequentially and are unlocked via player success in preceding races. The mode is called Coyote Weekend because the track Coyote Revenge features predominantly, and the races are presented as happening over a weekend festival over Saturday and Sunday. Out of the nine races, the Coyote Revenge track features five times, with various new routes and short-cuts. Four other tracks also feature in the Coyote Weekend festival. The download also includes two new vehicles, a bike, an ATV and a bonus vehicle that can be accessed on successful completion of the races. There is also a vehicle pack available on the PlayStation Network, that includes a rally car which looks very similar to a DeLorean and a Big Rig which is based on a prison bus, and new livery skins known as \"Numskull Helmets\" and \"Big Blue Bunny\".\n\nOn 27 September 2007 in USA, a third add-on was made available which included a truck (known as the \"Castro Capitano\", preceded by the \"Castro Robusto\") with three styles. On 25 October 2007 in Europe, a new Halloween livery was made available for download, on the Castro Robusto racing truck. Downloading this livery will automatically unlock the truck (but only for that livery, the others must be unlocked by progressing in the Festival). The Devil's Weekend pack was released in Europe and North America on 8 November 2007 it contains The Devil's Crossing track, nine new races, four new vehicles and new liveries such as \"Crazy Samurai\" and \"QuickFoot\" liveries. On 20 December 2007 in USA, it features a new downloadable holiday skin for \"Castro Varadero\" (a big rig). An additional two tracks were announced on 7 January 2008. Eagle's Nest & Diamondback Speedway were released in Europe on 11 January 2008 and in North America on 17 January 2008. On 7 February 2008 in North America and Europe, a Chinese New Year skin becomes available for download for the \"Wulff Revo\" rally car.\n\nDespite the closure of the multiplayer servers in 2012, it is still possible to download the game updates as of today, as they're required for DLC compatibility. While most PS3 games search for updates from the XMB or after starting them, this games requires the user to enter the now-defunct online modes in order to trigger the updating process. The most recent update is version 3.1.\n\nIn PlayStation Home on 9 October 2009, a \"MotorStorm\" themed personal apartment was released to all four versions of Home, being Asia, Europe, Japan, and North America. The apartment is called the \"\"MotorStorm\" Monument Valley Campsite\" and can be purchased from the Home Estates store in Home's shopping complex. There are also sixteen \"MotorStorm\" themed furniture items that can be purchased to go along with the apartment, including a sofa constructed from a mangled skateboard, the clapped out car seat from one of the original \"MotorStorm\" vehicles and a smouldering barbecue cunningly fashioned from an old oil-drum and other nondescript pieces of junk. These can be purchased from the Furniture store in Home's shopping complex.\n\n\"MotorStorm\" was featured at E3 2007 as fully supporting game launching in PlayStation Home, but was released without this feature. Its successor, \"MotorStorm: Pacific Rift\", however, did fully support game launching in Home. Although it does not fully support the feature, it could still be game launched through the Universal Game Launching method which does not have all of the features of a game that would have full support for game launching.\n\n\"MotorStorm\" was officially released in Japan on 14 December 2006, where it became the best-selling PlayStation 3 game; in North America on 6 March 2007; and in Europe as part of the European PlayStation 3 launch on 23 March 2007. Both the North American and European versions include online play, which was not included in the Japanese version at the time of its release. Online play for Japan was released in an update on 20 June 2007.\n\nBy 9 July 2007, \"MotorStorm\" had sold more than one million copies in North America.\nAs of October 2011 \"MotorStorm\" has sold 3.5 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"MotorStorm\" has received positive reviews, it holds an average rating of 82/100 on Metacritic as of September 2007 and 82% on GameRankings. The game was selected as one of Gaming Target's \"52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007. On the 11th annual interactive achievement award \"MotorStorm\" won racing game of the year. GameSpot praised the games online aspect saying \"Motorstorm's rampageous brand of racing is a great deal of fun\" as well as the graphics and soundtrack of the game while noting its lack of offline multiplayer and its single-player mode.\n\nIGN summed up its review by saying \"It may be shallow, but it's also the most engaging racing experience you'll find anywhere\", but expressed its excitement in the potential of its sequel due to the strong foundations the original laid out. However, GameTrailers criticized the AI of the game saying it was based on a \"rubber-band\" principle which allowed computer drivers to easily catch up with the player regardless of the player's performance, but it praised the online gameplay of MotorStorm as well as its gameplay physics.\n\n\"MotorStorm\" received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n"}

Rogers. She moved with her family to California at the age of two. As a child, her prowess at the game of baseball led her friends to nickname her Casey (after the famous poem \"Casey at the Bat\"). While under contract to Paramount, she used the stage name Laura Elliot. In 1955, she began working with a press agent in Hollywood, Walter Winslow Lewis III (aka \"Bud\"). It was Bud who suggested that she use the nickname with her maiden name and changed the \"C\" to a \"K\". They later married and had four children.\n\nRogers began work under the names Laura Elliott and Laura Elliot for Paramount Pictures. She appeared in movies such as \"Special Agent\", \"Samson and Delilah\", \"Silver City\", \"Paid in Full\", \"Two Lost Worlds\", and, in perhaps her best-known film role, Alfred Hitchcock's \"Strangers on a Train\", playing Miriam, the scheming, adulterous wife of Guy Haines (Farley Granger).\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Rogers began working on television. She guest-starred on various series, such as \"Sergeant Preston\", \"Stage 7\", \"The Restless Gun\", \"The Lone Ranger\", \"Bat Masterson\", \"Maverick\", \"Yancy Derringer\", \"Perry Mason\", as Francie Keene in the \"\" episode \"Railroaded\", and many other programs. In 1964 she landed a starring role on \"Peyton Place\", portraying the character Julie Anderson, the mother of Betty Anderson (Barbara Parkins). She left the series in 1966 to replace Irene Vernon in the role of Louise Tate on \"Bewitched\". In 1972, she performed as Louise Tate for the final time in the episode \"Serena's Youth Pill\". She then retired from acting, appearing in only a few guest television spots and making appearances on the \"Bewitched\" edition of \"E! True Hollywood Story\".\n\nTwice-married and the mother of four (and a grandmother), Rogers had in recent years turned her talents to writing and development, including a proposed new television series, \"Son of a Witch\".\n\nA Democrat, she supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election. She was a Presbyterian.\n\nAfter battling throat cancer for many years, Rogers went into cardiac arrest. She then suffered a stroke and died in Los Angeles, California, on July 6, 2006, aged 80. She was buried at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the 1970s, she became involved with motorcycles after her son began riding and then racing at the age of nine. Rogers became involved in the world of motocross racing. She worked closely with the AMA and established PURR (\"PowderPuffs Unlimited Riders and Racers\"), an association that brought women into the male-dominated sport, in 1974. PURR would later evolve into what is now the Women's Pro-Class division.\n\nRogers wrote five books with Mark Wood. The first was \"The Bewitched Cookbook: Magic in the Kitchen\" (1996), a cookbook based on the television series \"Bewitched\" with the foreword written by Rogers' co-star and friend Sandra Gould. Her other books are \"Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Décor\" (2001), \"Character Wreaths: Holiday Projects for Year 'Round Decor\" (2002), \"Decorating for Christmas\" (2003), and \"Create a Bewitched Falloween: 55 Projects for Decorating and Entertaining\" (2003). Rogers and Wood filmed an unaired pilot for a proposed how-to craft series, \"Hands on Holidays\". The pilot was released on DVD in 2006.\n\nIn 2013, \"Bewitched and Beyond: The Fan Who Came to Dinner\" by Mark Wood (with Eddie Lucas) was published by BearManor Media, a book that recounts Wood's friendship with Rogers. The title of Charles Tranberg's biography of Agnes Moorehead, \"I Love the Illusion\", derives from Rogers' recounting how Moorehead used this expression when asked about acting.\n\n"}
{"id": "2242248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242248", "title": "University of Yangon", "text": "University of Yangon\n\nThe University of Yangon (also Yangon University; , ; formerly Rangoon College, Rangoon University and Rangoon Arts and Sciences University), located in Kamayut, Yangon, is the oldest university in Myanmar's modern education system and the best known university in Myanmar. The university offers mainly undergraduate and postgraduate degrees (Bachelor's, Master's, Post-graduate Diploma, and Doctorate) programs in liberal arts, sciences and law. Full-time bachelor's degrees were not offered at the university's main campus after the student protests of 1996. The bachelor's degree was re-offered from 2014 on, to the best students in the country. Today degrees in Political Science are offered to undergraduate students, as well as postgraduate diplomas in areas such as social work and geology.\n\nInitially most major universities in the country depended on Yangon University. Until 1958 when Mandalay University became an independent university, all institutions of higher education in Myanmar were under Yangon University. After the University Education Act of 1964, all \"professional\" colleges and institutes of the university such as the Institute of Medicine 1, Rangoon Institute of Technology and Yangon Institute of Economics became independent universities, leaving the Yangon University with liberal arts, sciences and law. In Myanmar, responsibility for higher education depends on various ministries. The University of Yangon depends from the Ministry of education.\n\nYangon University has been at the centre of civil discontent throughout its history. All three nationwide strikes against the British (1920, 1936 and 1938) began at Rangoon University. Anti-colonial movement's leaders such as General Aung San, U Nu, Ne Win and U Thant are some of the notable alumni of the university. The tradition of student protest at the university continued in the post-colonial era—in 1962, 1974, 1988 and in 1996.\n\nEstablished in 1878 as an of the University of Calcutta, the Rangoon College was operated and managed by the Education Syndicate set up by the British colonial administration. The college was renamed Government College in 1904, and University College in 1920. Rangoon University was founded in 1920, when University College (Rangoon College - secular) and Judson College (Baptist-affiliated) were merged by the University of Rangoon Act. The American Baptist Mission decided to recognize Judson College (formerly Baptist College) as a separate institution within Rangoon University. Rangoon University modelled itself after University of Cambridge and University of Oxford. All subsequent institutions of higher learning founded by the British were placed under Rangoon University's administration: Mandalay College in Mandalay in 1925, Teachers Training College and Medical College in Yangon in 1930, and Agriculture College in Mandalay in 1938.\n\nAlthough it was attended only by the elites of the day, the university was at the centre of the anti-colonial movement. Students protested against the British government's control of the University and the Rangoon Act which placed the governor as chancellor of the University of Rangoon. All three nationwide strikes against the British colonial government (1920, 1936 and 1938) began at the university. Myanmar National Day in fact commemorates the rebellion of Burmese students at Rangoon University in 1920. By the 1930s the university was the hotbed of Burmese nationalism, producing a number of future senior Burmese politicians, including General Aung San, U Nu, Ba Maw, Kyaw Nyein, Ba Swe, U Thant and Thein Pe Myint.\nRangoon University became one of the most prestigious universities in Southeast Asia and one of the top universities in Asia, attracting students from across the region. The Japanese occupied the University during the Second World War, but it recovered and flourished after Burma gained independence in 1948. This golden period ended in 1962.\n\nAfter the military coup of 1962 under General Ne Win, and under the Burmese Way to Socialism, Rangoon University was put directly under the control of the Directorate of Higher Education, a central government agency, whereas previously it was run by a council of professors, scholars and government officials. In addition, the medium of instruction was changed to Burmese, a radical departure from English, which had been the University's medium of instruction since its founding. Educational standards began to decline markedly, and international bodies ceased to recognize degrees issued or obtained at the University. The university was also renamed the Rangoon Arts and Sciences University (abbreviated RASU), after certain departments and faculties (medicine, economics, education, etc.) were separated from the University in 1964.\n\nRangoon University students staged a peaceful demonstration and protest on campus against 'unjust university rules' on 7 July 1962. Ne Win sent his troops to disperse the students. Dozens of students were killed and the historic Rangoon University Student Union (RUSU) was reduced to rubble the next morning.\n\nIn November 1974 the former UN Secretary General U Thant died, and on the day of his funeral on 5 December 1974, Rangoon University students snatched his coffin on display at the Kyaikkasan Race Course, and erected a makeshift mausoleum on the grounds of the RUSU in protest against the government for not honouring their famous countryman with a state funeral. The military stormed the campus on 11 December killing some of the students, recovered the coffin, and buried U Thant at the foot of the Shwedagon Pagoda.\n\nStudent protests against protest against General Ne Win's socialist government culminated in 1988. Student protest in March 1988 was met with a violent response from the government. This did not stop the protests. On 8 August 1988, students around the country came together to protest against the military regime. The protest was supported by hundreds of thousands of people who went into the street in protest against the military rule. This is today remembered at the 8888 uprising. The movement was crushed by the army Chief of Staff General Saw Maung who took over and instated the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC or na wa ta). It is estimated that more than 300 students died in the protests. In the months and years that followed, many more were imprisoned.\n\nIn 1989, the military junta changed place names throughout Myanmar; the University was renamed Yangon University. The University was closed for most of the 1990s, because of fears of a repeat of the 8888 Uprising. To prevent students from congregating, the government dispersed the existing institutions and departments that made up Yangon University into separate learning institutions scattered throughout the city. Till 2013 only graduate studies, certain professional courses, and a few diploma courses were conducted at the University's main campus. Newer universities such as Dagon University, University of East Yangon and University of West Yangon were created to cater for undergraduates.\n\nYangon University celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in a week-long celebration, which began on 1 December 1995. The Jubilee marked the school's formal establishment of 75 years. For its commemoration, the government built the Diamond Jubilee Hall, a four-storied building in the University's grounds, which cost K 630,000,000, and a new set of postage stamps was also produced. Once-affiliated institutes and departments (e.g., the Institute of Economics, Yangon which began life as a department at Yangon University), which had already separated, also celebrated.\n\nThe transitioning to a new government in 2011 Myanmar was followed by a renewed focus on education. In 2013, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was named head of the \"Yangon University Upgrading and Restoration Committee\". In December 2013, the University re-opened for undergraduate students. Initially only 50 undergraduate students were accepted. A controversial National Education Law was enacted in 2014. Under the law the university is managed by the Ministry of Education, who also appoints the university rector.\n\nYangon University is located in Yangon, along the southwestern bank of Inya Lake, the largest lake in the city. It is on the corner of Pyay Road and University Avenue Road in Kamayut Township, north of downtown Yangon. The modern campus of Yangon University completed construction in 1920. There are two campuses, namely Main Campus and Hlaing Campus, the former being the most well-known. Judson Church, inside the main campus of the University, is a Baptist church, and like Judson College, named after Adoniram Judson, a 19th-century American missionary who compiled the first Burmese-English dictionary. The main campus also contains a convocation hall.\n\nThe accommodation in Burma is not mixed and the availability is limited. Women's halls have many limited rules whilst men's a few.\n\n\n\nEach department offers an undergraduate degree programme. The Department of International Relations offers two: the Bachelor of Arts (International Relations) and the Bachelor of Arts (Political Science).\n\nYangon University offers undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes. The undergraduate programmes are subdivided into three categories: Arts (B.A.), Sciences (B.Sc.), and Law(LL.B). The choice of different fields of learning takes place in upper secondary school where students choose particular subjects directed towards their tertiary education. Postgraduate degrees are separated into three groups: Doctorates, Master's, and diplomas. Although YU no longer offered the undergraduate degrees owing to the uprising in 1996,it now was reopened for the undergraduate degrees with the name of (COE) what literally means \"Center of Excellence\" in 2014 and accepted only 50 selectively excellent students for each field of studies. (Although undergraduate and postgraduate programmes are still available to current days, the recognition of status of international COE of the university has been discontinued.)\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in a former school designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh between 1903 and 1906. The building is one of Glasgow's foremost architectural attractions. It is located next to the Shields Road subway station.\n\nMackintosh based the design of the school on Rowallan Castle in Ayrshire and Falkland Palace. The building features a pair of windowed Scottish baronial style tower staircases and a tiled Drill Hall. During the building's construction, Mackintosh frequently battled the school board about the design (the board wanted a less expensive design). The total cost for the building was £34,291, which was over budget. The school was designed for an enrolment of 1,250. However, by the 1970s the area was experiencing urban decay, and the school's enrolment fell to under 100. The school closed in 1979.\n\nActivities and exhibits at the museum include an opportunity to participate in a Victorian classroom situation, with actor employees such as Iain Simpson and Lesley Robertson playing teachers who impose strict discipline.\n\nThe school is the subject of a 2018 documentary by Margaret Moore, \"Scotland Street School Remembers\".\n\n\n\n"}

The original walls were likely a simple wooden fence with guard towers built in 1156.\nKremlin walls, like many cathedrals in Kremlin were built by Italian architects. There are multiple walls with design of “swallow tail” in Verona.\n\nOne of the most symbolic constructions in Russia's history, the Moscow Kremlin Wall can be traced back to the 12th century when Moscow was founded in 1147. The original outpost was surrounded by the first walls in 1156, built by Yuri Dolgoruki, prince of Suzdal, which were most likely a simple wooden fence with guard towers. Destroyed in 1238 by the Mongol-Tartar invasion, the Moscow Kremlin was rebuilt by the Russian Knyaz Ivan Kalita. In 1339-1340 he erected a bigger fortress on the site of the original outpost which was defended by massive oak walls. Thought to be an impenetrable defence from raids, it was proven to be useless against raids which burned Moscow in 1365. \n\nNevertheless, the young knyaz Dmitry Donskoy in 1367 began a rebuilding of the fortress. All winter long from the Mukachyovo village 30 (country miles) from Moscow, limestone was hauled back on sledges, allowing the construction of the first stone walls to begin the following spring. The walls successfully withstood two sieges during the Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1368–72). Within a few years the city was adorned with beautiful white-stone walls. Whilst it was successfully invaded by the Tatars again in 1382, the massive fortification suffered no damage.\n\nDmitry Donskoy's walls stood for over a century, and it was during this period that Muscovy rose as the dominant power in Northeastern Rus. By the end of the 15th century, however, it was clear that the old constructions had long passed their time and Czar Ivan the Great's visions. Between 1485 and 1495 a whole brigade of Italian architects took part in the erection of a new defence perimeter including Antonio Fryazin (Antonio Gilardi), Marko Fryazin (Marco Ruffo), Pyotr Fryazin (Pietro Antonio Solari) and Alexei Fryazin the Old (Aloisio da Milano). (The term \"Fryazin\" was used to refer to all people of Italian origin at this time). The new walls were erected by building on top of the older walls (some white stone can still be seen at the base in some places). The thickness and height was dramatically increased requiring many wooden houses which surrounded the Kremlin to be torn down.\n\nIn the following centuries Moscow expanded rapidly outside the Kremlin walls and as Russia's borders became more and more secure their defensive duty has all but passed. The cannons which were installed in the walls were removed after the turn of the 17th century, as was the second, smaller wall which repeated the perimeter on the outside. During the reign of Czar Alexei Romanov, the towers were built up with decorative spires and the walls were restored. However their historical mightiness was dampened as the material became brick not stone. Successive restorations of varying scale took place during the reigns of Empress Elizabeth and Alexander the First as well as the later Soviet and Russian times, preserving their original character and style.\n\nWith an outer perimeter of , the Kremlin appears as a loose triangle, deviating from the geometric ideal on the southern side where instead of a straight line, it repeats the contours on the original hill on which the Kremlin rests. Because of this the vertical profile is by no means uniform, and the height at some places ranges from no more than quadrupling to elsewhere. The thickness of the walls also varies from .\n\nThe top of the walls, along their entire length, have outwardly-invisible battle platforms which also range from in width (in proportion to the thickness). A total of 1,045 double-horned notched \"teeth\" crown the top of the walls, with a height ranging from and thickness from .\n\nSome of the interior corridors inside the walls have rooms with no exterior illumination () where particularly dangerous criminals were contained.\n\nTo date twenty towers survived, highlighting the walls. Built at a different time, the oldest one, Tainitskaya dates to 1485 whilst the newest one-Tsarskaya to 1680. Three of the towers, located in the corners of the castle have unique circular profiles. From the ground level it is only possible to enter six of the towers, the rest only from the walls.\n\nFour gate towers exist, all crowned with ruby stars, they are Spasskaya, Borovitskaya, Troitskaya and Nikolskaya. Although up to the 1930 it was also possible to enter the Kremlin via the gates of Tainitskaya tower, however these were covered up yet leaving their portal clearly visible.\n\nThe main gates in the Spasskaya tower are normally (with the exception of official and religious ceremonies) closed to the public. The gates under the Nikolskaya tower are often used for service duties only. Visitors to the Kremlin normally enter the premises via the gates under the Troitksaya tower, except for those who wish to visit the Armoury chamber and the Treasury fond, which are accessible via the gates of the Borovitskaya tower.\nBefore 1917 it was also possible to book an excursion, lasting over two hours, to walk along the perimeter of the Kremlin walls, beginning at the Borovitskaya tower.\n\nThe southern part of the wall faces the Moskva River. The eastern part faces Red Square. The western part, formerly facing the Neglinnaya River, is now part of the Alexander Garden. The bridge which previously crossed the river still stands, and is done in the same style as the Kremlin wall.\n\n\n"}

He attended the universities of Leiden and Leipzig, travelled in England, France, Italy and the Netherlands, and on his return was appointed groom of the bedchamber (Kammerjunker) to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, whom he accompanied on his campaigns in Pomerania and Sweden.\n\nIn 1680 Canitz became councillor of legation, and he was employed on various embassies.

{"id": "2242309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242309", "title": "Oldham Loop Line", "text": "Oldham Loop Line\n\nThe Oldham Loop Line was a local railway route in Greater Manchester, England, used by trains that ran from Manchester Victoria to Rochdale via Oldham Mumps. Services on the line at the time of its closure were operated by Northern Rail.\n\nThe line closed on 3 October 2009 for conversion during 2009–2012 to light rail use for Metrolink services; the route now carries trams and is known as the Oldham and Rochdale Line (ORL).\n\nThe Oldham Loop diverged from the Caldervale Line at Thorpes Bridge Junction in Newton Heath, Manchester and re-joined it at Rochdale East Junction. The line was long, and was double-track from Thorpes Bridge Junction to Shaw & Crompton, and single-line from Shaw & Crompton to Rochdale East Junction. There were two tunnels on the route between Oldham Werneth and Oldham Mumps railway stations. There were nine intermediate stations on the route. In the early 1970s the line from Shaw & Crompton to Rochdale was reduced to single track working. This was due to save money on maintenance when services were much reduced.\n\nThe history of the Oldham Loop Line was intertwined with the early history of railways in the Manchester and Oldham area, and to some extent also with the geography of Oldham which meant that there was no direct Manchester to Oldham line until quite late in the 19th century.\n\nThe first railway line to be built in the area was the Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR) which opened on 4 July 1839 to Littleborough and throughout on 1 March 1841. Although this line ran close to Rochdale, it missed out Middleton and more importantly Oldham as well. A station was built at Mills Hill to provide a railhead for Middleton and Oldham. This was only intended as a short time measure given that Oldham was already a substantial manufacturing centre by this date. The first railway into Oldham was a branch from Middleton Junction to Oldham Werneth which opened on 31 March 1842. This line included the Werneth Incline which had a gradient of 1 in 27 and was one of the steepest lines in the country regularly used by passenger trains. The situation of the first station in Oldham on the outskirts of town was not entirely satisfactory, and in 1847 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, the successor to the M&LR, extended the line from Oldham Werneth to a new station at Oldham Mumps. There was also an intermediate station at Oldham Central. The line and the two new stations opened on 1 November 1847.\n\nThere was a further extension of the line from Oldham Mumps to Rochdale East Junction on 1 November 1863. This line included stations at Milnrow, New Hey and Shaw & Crompton. A branch off this line to Royton was opened on 21 March 1864, followed on 1 July 1864 by Royton Junction railway station.\n\nThe operational problems of the Werneth Incline had led to the consideration of a more direct route from Oldham Werneth to Manchester to bypass it as early as 1848, but it was not until August 1876 that construction of the line began. It took nearly four years to complete, opening on 17 May 1880 along with the stations at Hollinwood and Dean Lane. Failsworth station opened slightly later on 26 April 1881. With the construction of this section of line the whole route from Rochdale East Junction to Thorpes Bridge Junction, Newton Heath was complete and it became known as the Oldham Loop Line.\n\nThe Royton to Royton Junction line was listed for closure by the Beeching Axe of the 1960s. Royton closed to goods services on 2 November 1964 and passenger services on 18 April 1966. Although not mentioned by Beeching, a further closure in the 1960s was Oldham Central which also closed on 18 April 1966.\n\nRoyton Junction station, renamed as Royton, stayed open but by the 1980s a replacement for it was being considered. Derker opened on 30 August 1985. For a short period trains stopped at either Derker or Royton, but eventually Royton (formerly Royton Junction) railway station was closed on 8 May 1987. This was the last station closure before the whole of the Oldham Loop Line was closed for conversion to Metrolink.\n\nThe pattern of passenger services over the line was always that all trains from Manchester ran to Oldham Mumps, but fewer continued on to terminate in a bay platform at Rochdale. It was not usual for trains to terminate at Oldham Mumps and instead they ran on to Royton (until its closure in 1966), and subsequently to Shaw & Crompton. While the Middleton Junction to Oldham Werneth line was open there were a few services over that route to Oldham Mumps, Royton or Rochdale. By 1950 this had reduced to a handful of trains per day, and the services over the line reduced further until its closure in early 1963.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s only slightly fewer trains ran from Oldham Mumps to Rochdale, but in May 1972 the Secretary of State for Transport announced that this part of the Oldham Loop would be closed. The closure did not go ahead because what later became the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) agreed to fund the continuation of services. The involvement of the GMPTE also led to a more frequent pattern of trains serving the Oldham Mumps to Rochdale section.\n\nFrom 2007 Network Rail made the annual leaf fall timetable permanent year round due to concerns over the condition of the track and performance. Trains were timetabled to connect with the Caldervale Line services to Leeds via and Bradford Interchange. All stations and all scheduled train services were operated by Northern Rail and its predecessors. During the week, trains ran every 15 minutes on the route, with express trains leaving Manchester at 00 and 30 minutes past the hour calling at Oldham Mumps, Shaw & Crompton and all stations to Rochdale, and stopping trains calling at all stations between Manchester and Shaw & Crompton, leaving at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour. This skip-stop service gave an effective half hourly service frequency to the stations on the line. During the evenings and on Sundays services were less frequent with an hourly service calling at all stations.\n\nAt the time of closure the line's sole regular goods service was to the waste management plant next to Dean Lane railway station at the southern end of the Oldham Loop. Usually only a single train a day used this facility. Its current operation is unaffected by the conversion to Metrolink.\n\nIn the period up to closure all passenger services were operated by diesel multiple units, as the line was not electrified. The most common types of unit were Class 142 and Class 150 with occasional Class 153 and Class 156.\n\nEvents held on 3 October 2009, the last day of operation, included the naming of Class 156 unit no 156 466 as \"Gracie Fields\" to commemorate the Oldham Loop Line's 146 years of history. A steam special hauled by locomotive 45231 was the last steam train over the line. It was followed later in the day by a heritage diesel railtour. The last train from Manchester Victoria to Rochdale departed at 23:25.\n\nThe Oldham Loop was included in proposals in 1984 for conversion to light rail operation. The proposed \"Light Rapid Transit\" system was intended to run from Rochdale via Oldham through Manchester Victoria and across Manchester City Centre via on-street tram lines. The system eventually came into operation in 1992 as Manchester Metrolink. While the Oldham loop line was not included in the first phase of Metrolink, the line is now open, having been converted to Metrolink operation as part of its Phase 3 development.\n\nWork started on the conversion in 2009, after heavy rail services ceased on 3 October 2009. Replacement bus services were planned to operate until the tram service commenced, but lack of patronage led to their withdrawal within months. Pending completion, former rail users had the choice between normal bus services, none of which ran along the complete length of the loop line, or driving to an alternative station. The latter occurred immediately after the Oldham Loop closure, leading to severe overcrowding on the Caldervale line In response TfGM stepped in to pay for the former loop line stock to be used to strengthen Manchester-Rochdale services.\n\nGMPTE originally announced that Metrolink services would be introduced as follows \n\nBy summer 2011, the project was running several months behind schedule. The reasons include diversion of resources to other Metrolink extensions to Chorlton and Ashton (themselves badly behind schedule) and issues with the new signalling system proposed for systemwide use. Announced dates for Oldham loop openings were shown on Metrolink's own site as follows on 11 August 2011 \n\nTransport for Greater Manchester announced during the week commencing 4 June 2012 that the line as far as Oldham Mumps will open to passenger services as an extension of the Manchester Victoria to St Werburgh's Road service on Wednesday 13 June 2012.\n\nTrams finally began running through to Shaw & Crompton on 16 December 2012 and through to Rochdale on 28 February 2013, almost a year later than originally planned. This section has two new stops (at Kingsway and Newbold) and has been re-doubled from Shaw to Rochdale, except for the flyover which takes it across the Calder Valley main line. Trams also began running through to East Didsbury in May 2013, with the commissioning of the South Manchester Line extension from St Werburgh's Road.\n\nThe local press have reported a series of complaints about the conversion project and, latterly, the delayed opening dates.\n\nPhase 3B of the expansion project involved constructing a branch between Werneth and Oldham Mumps into Oldham town centre. This was fully operational in 2014. The line between the heavy-rail Oldham Mumps and Oldham Werneth stations has been lifted for re-use in other areas.\n\nThe places served by the Oldham Loop Line in the period immediately before closure were as follows:\n"}

The condition derives from an endotoxin released by the bacteria \"Pantoea agglomerans\" which lives in cotton plants.\n\nA condition similar to cotton fever was described in the early 1940s among cotton-farm workers. The term \"cotton fever\" was coined in 1975 after the syndrome was recognized in intravenous drug users.\n\nSigns and symptoms of cotton fever usually appear within 20 minutes after injection, but may come on gradually over the course of a few hours. In addition to fever, they may include headaches, malaise, chills, nausea, extreme joint and muscle pain, a sudden onset of dull, sharp, piercing or burning back and kidney pain, tremors, anxiety, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. The fever itself usually reaches during the full onset. Extreme chills and uncontrollable shivering are common. The symptoms of cotton fever resemble those of sepsis and patients can be initially misdiagnosed upon admission to a hospital.\n\nCotton fever may bear resemblance to other bodily infections such as the flu; a culture would be required to determine whether a particular patient has been infected by the specific bacteria (Pantoea agglomerans) that causes true cotton fever. Confusion continues to exist as outdated or inaccurate definitions of the condition, including its causes, remain widespread, especially among intravenous drug users, who are likely to self-diagnose based on local common knowledge.\n\nAlthough it cannot be ruled out, cotton fever could possibly result from direct introduction of a small cotton fiber or other particulate matter into the bloodstream which may have attached itself to the tip of a used or blunted hypodermic needle. Another possibility is seen by the increased infection rate due to cotton particles introducing bacteria directly into the bloodstream. Cotton fever, or more specifically its symptoms, can also occur from injecting old blood back into the bloodstream. Though doing so doesn’t result in true cotton fever caused by enterobacter agglomerans, it results in presentation of cotton fever’s symptoms; fever, severe chills, myalgia, spasmodic muscles especially those of the neck and back, tachycardia, profuse hidrosis, shortness of breath, lethargy, and fatigue. I/V injection of old blood cells can introduce myriad bacterium and/or microbes into one’s bloodstream as old blood, i.e blood left behind in a previously used syringe, acts as a Petri dish for culturing such micro-organisms. A blood smear and/or culture must be performed, however, to determine the specific pathogenic organism.\n\nCotton fever has specific symptoms that differentiate it from other ailments: fever, chills, and shortness of breath. In Europe, cotton fever is commonly called \"the shakes\"—a reference to another common symptom of cotton fever. Those with this ailment often experience violent shaking or shivering.\n\nThese symptoms normally occur immediately following an injection, but there are reports of lags up to an hour in length.\n\nUnder most circumstances, cotton fever is quite benign. Although it is possible for it to turn into something much more serious like a pneumonia. Normally, however, the symptoms of cotton fever disappear within a few hours, e.g. symptoms usually occur immediately following an injection, but there are reports of lags up to an hour in length.\n\nCotton fever rarely requires medical treatment but is sometimes warranted if the high fever does not break within a few hours of the onset. It will usually resolve itself within a day. Soaking in a warm bath along with a fever reducer can alleviate symptoms. Extreme cases (particularly severe or long-lasting) can be treated with antibiotics. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2242375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242375", "title": "Parallel programming model", "text": "Parallel programming model\n\nIn computing, a parallel programming model is an abstraction of parallel computer architecture, with which it is convenient to express algorithms and their composition in programs. The value of a programming model can be judged on its \"generality\": how well a range of different problems can be expressed for a variety of different architectures, and its \"performance\": how efficiently the compiled programs can execute. The implementation of a parallel programming model can take the form of a library invoked from a sequential language, as an extension to an existing language, or as an entirely new language.\n\nConsensus around a particular programming model is important because it leads to different parallel computers being built with support for the model, thereby facilitating portability of software. In this sense, programming models are referred to as \"bridging\" between hardware and software.\n\nClassifications of parallel programming models can be divided broadly into two areas: process interaction and problem decomposition.\n\nProcess interaction relates to the mechanisms by which parallel processes are able to communicate with each other. The most common forms of interaction are shared memory and message passing, but interaction can also be implicit (invisible to the programmer).\n\nShared memory is an efficient means of passing data between processes. In a shared-memory model, parallel processes share a global address space that they read and write to asynchronously. Asynchronous concurrent access can lead to race conditions, and mechanisms such as locks, semaphores and monitors can be used to avoid these. Conventional multi-core processors directly support shared memory, which many parallel programming languages and libraries, such as Cilk, OpenMP and Threading Building Blocks, are designed to exploit.\n\nIn a message-passing model, parallel processes exchange data through passing messages to one another. These communications can be asynchronous, where a message can be sent before the receiver is ready, or synchronous, where the receiver must be ready. The Communicating sequential processes (CSP) formalisation of message passing uses synchronous communication channels to connect processes, and led to important languages such as Occam, Limbo and Go. In contrast, the actor model uses asynchronous message passing and has been employed in the design of languages such as D, Scala and SALSA.\n\nIn an implicit model, no process interaction is visible to the programmer and instead the compiler and/or runtime is responsible for performing it. Two examples of implicit parallelism are with domain-specific languages where the concurrency within high-level operations is prescribed, and with functional programming languages because the absence of side-effects allows non-dependent functions to be executed in parallel. However, this kind of parallelism is difficult to manage and functional languages such as Concurrent Haskell and Concurrent ML provide features to manage parallelism explicitly.\n\nA parallel program is composed of simultaneously executing processes. Problem decomposition relates to the way in which the constituent processes are formulated.\n\nA task-parallel model focuses on processes, or threads of execution. These processes will often be behaviourally distinct, which emphasises the need for communication. Task parallelism is a natural way to express message-passing communication. In Flynn's taxonomy, task parallelism is usually classified as MIMD/MPMD or MISD.\n\nA data-parallel model focuses on performing operations on a data set, typically a regularly structured array. A set of tasks will operate on this data, but independently on disjoint partitions. In Flynn's taxonomy, data parallelism is usually classified as MIMD/SPMD or SIMD.\n\nAs with implicit process interaction, an implicit model of parallelism reveals nothing to the programmer as the compiler, the runtime or the hardware is responsible. For example, in compilers, automatic parallelization is the process of converting sequential code into parallel code, and in computer architecture, superscalar execution is a mechanism whereby instruction-level parallelism is exploited to perform operations in parallel.\n\nParallel programming models are closely related to models of computation. A model of parallel computation is an abstraction used to analyze the cost of computational processes, but it does not necessarily need to be practical, in that it can be implemented efficiently in hardware and/or software. A programming model, in contrast, does specifically imply the practical considerations of hardware and software implementation.\n\nA parallel programming language may be based on one or a combination of programming models. For example, High Performance Fortran is based on shared-memory interactions and data-parallel problem decomposition, and Go provides mechanism for shared-memory and message-passing interaction.\n\n\n"}

Urban was the first coeducational SF private high school, the only SF high school at the time to not include letter grades, and developed a blocks schedule system focused on academic immersion and understanding. Today Urban has grown from just 22 students into a student body of over 400, with over 700 applicants annually for the Freshman class. \n\nAfter 32 years, Mark Salkind retired as Head of School in June 2019. Dan B. Miller was appointed Head of School in July 2019. \n\nUrban's grading and evaluation system discourages competition and comparison. The school, up until 2011, did not show students letter grades until their senior year. Now it provides letter grades at the end of each course, with a primary focus on written teacher evaluations. Urban teachers write two thorough reports each term for each student, providing comprehensive feedback on student achievement and setting specific goals and strategies for improvement. Students are also asked to reflect on and formally evaluate their work. \n\nUrban organizes the school year using a three-term system rather than a conventional semester system. The schedule divides the academic year into three, 12-week terms: fall, winter and spring. Students take four classes every term. These classes meet for 70-minute periods with one 2-hour+ period per week. \n\nUrban's schedule allows for more concentrated, less fragmented learning than does a traditional high school schedule. It enables students and teachers to focus on each area of study in greater depth and approach the material in a variety of ways: in-depth discussions, independent and group projects, films, research and field trips into surrounding communities and environments.\n\nIn addition, students take electives such as Jazz Band, Urban Singers, or Newspaper, or participate in a physical activity or study halls during a shorter period. There is also time for advising, grade-level meetings, all-school meetings, and consultation periods for students to meet individually with teachers within this block schedule. \n\nUrban’s curriculum includes core academic classes common to most high schools, as well as a number of specialized courses, advanced electives and creative arts courses usually found at the college level.\n\nTwo terms of a class make up one credit; an elective class that only lasts one term is therefore .5 credits. In order to graduate from Urban and complete the required courses for admittance to the UC system and other highly selective colleges, the following credits must be taken in each subject matter:\n\nThrough strong relationships with their teachers, advisors and with each other, Urban students have the opportunity to learn early on how to navigate a culture of collaboration, inclusion and mutual respect. Urban has over 40 student clubs, as well as student government, an active outdoor and class trips program, and a student newspaper, yearbook, and online literary and arts journal. Performing arts opportunities include fall and winter theater productions, circus class performances and the annual One Acts Festival, as well as comprehensive jazz band, choral, and ensemble programs. \n\nSince its inception, Urban has prioritized diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as integral to learning both in and outside the classroom. From creating one of the first admissions diversity goals in San Francisco schools in the 90's, to an annual Month Of Understanding in January, and Identity and an Ethnic Studies class for Freshmen, Urban has asserted itself at the forefront of this conversation within independent high schools. \n\nUrban is currently working toward ensuring equitable access to its programs and practices, developing inclusive teaching practices and student culture, and freedom of personal expression and experience among students. In December 2017, Urban leadership launched the initiative, Urban Thrives, which integrates diversity, equity and inclusion core values into longterm, measurable goals for the school, students, faculty, staff, and leadership. \nA member of the Bay Area Conference and Bay Counties League-West (BCL-West), Urban hosts title-winning interscholastic teams in baseball, basketball, cross-country, fencing, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball. Athletic practices and games are held in the Mark Salkind Center Gym, the St. Agnes Gym, and other venues throughout the city and in Golden Gate Park. Over 65 percent of all Urban students participate on 27 boys, girls and co-ed athletic teams in the department. \n\nGraduates of the Urban School matriculate to a variety of schools, including Ivy League and highly selective public and private colleges and universities, as well as specialized schools for those gifted in science, engineering, and visual and performing arts. In the past five years, students have gone on to more than 130 colleges/universities. Typically 99-100 percent of Urban students attend a four-year college or university after graduation.\n\nThe Urban School, because it is private and self-supporting, charges $46,676 per student for tuition and laptop fees. Urban provides financial aid to 30+% of its students who have demonstrated need as determined by the school and the NAIS Student Service for Financial Aid .\n\nUrban's student newspaper, called \"The Urban Legend,\" is an award-winning member of the National Scholastic Press Association.\n\nIn September 2016, Urban opened the Mark Salkind Athletics and Academics Center, expanding the Urban campus by 50%. The new space includes a multifunctional gym, classrooms, conference rooms, office spaces, a cafeteria, and a rooftop courtyard/grass area. \n\nIn response to the Coronavirus global pandemic, and California's shelter-in-place order, Urban launched their Virtual Urban curriculum March 16, 2020, with all classes remaining online. Student schedules, homework policies, and more have all be reassessed to accommodate both students and faculty for virtual learning. \n\n"}

He attended City College of New York with Julius Rosenberg and later worked with Rosenberg and Alfred Sarant at the United States Army Signal Corps laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey during World War II.\n\nThe Army Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, hired Barr as an electrical engineer in July 1940. Julius Rosenberg signed on with the corps as a junior engineer two months later. \n\nIn 1941 they were recruited as Soviet spies by Jacob Golos. Barr's code name was Meter. They in turn persuaded Alfred Sarant to join the network.\n\nAccording to Alexandr Feklisov: However, he was at first reluctant to become a spy but was eventually convinced to join the network by Barr.\n\nBarr was recruited into espionage by Rosenberg. In turn, he recruited Sarant and the two shared an apartment and were allowed to function as a team by their KGB Case Officer, Alexander Feklisov. A.Feklisov regarded the pair as the most productive members of the group.\n\nBoth Barr and Sarant were trained and employed as electrical engineers and worked on military radar. Barr was discovered by counterintelligence to be a Communist and was fired. He and Sarant then found employment with Western Electric and worked on a highly secret radar bombsight. Barr and Sarant gave the USSR over 9,000 pages of documents detailing over 100 weapons systems.\n\nWhen the war ended the two founded Sarant Laboratories, and sought defense contracts, but the company soon failed, after which the two split up. Barr worked for a while in late 1946 with Sperry Gyroscope Company on secret military radar systems, but was fired in 1947 after the United States Air Force refused him a security clearance. \n\nBarr then moved to Europe, studying engineering in Sweden and music composition in Paris with Olivier Messiaen. Barr disappeared from his Paris apartment the day after David Greenglass was arrested, and fled to Czechoslovakia without taking his belongings. The KGB gave him a new identity; for the rest of his life Barr was known as Joseph Berg. In the summer of 1951, Barr met up with Sarant and the woman Sarant ran away with, Carol Dayton. Barr and Sarant, living under the name Philip Staros, settled in Prague, where they headed a successful effort to design the first automated anti-aircraft weapon created in the Soviet bloc, a weapon that was used with minor modifications through the 1980s.\n\nIn 1956, the two transferred to Leningrad and were put at the head of a military electronics research institute, and enjoyed the benefits of the Soviet Nomenklatura. In May 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev toured their institute and agreed to their plan to establish a new city dedicated entirely to microelectronics. The city, Zelenograd, was built on the outskirts of Moscow and Sarant was named deputy director, with authority over more than 20,000 engineers and scientists. Barr and Sarant lost their positions at Zelenograd when Khrushchev was deposed, but they continued to work on military projects, including the Uzel fire-control computer that was installed in Tango and Kilo class submarines.\n\nIn 1983, a Russian émigré, Mark Kuchment, working at Harvard University's Russian Research Center, who had read \"The Rosenberg File\", linked Barr and Sarant to two prominent Soviet scientists, both native speakers of English.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992, Barr returned to the United States but denied his participation in espionage. He split the next six years between the U.S. and Russia, and died in 1998 in Moscow, Russia.\n\nThere are seven deciphered KGB transmissions about Joel Barr. Barr's code name in the Soviet intelligence and in deciphered Venona project transcripts was originally \"Meter\" (also \"Metre\" and \"Metr\"); it was later changed to \"Scout\" (also \"Skaut\").

This series was followed two weeks later by the more popular \"Ultraman\" (1966), the second Ultra Series.\n\n\"Ultra Q\" can be described as a half-hour Toho kaiju series. Executive Producer Eiji Tsuburaya intended this series to be more like the American television series \"The Twilight Zone\" and \"The Outer Limits\", featuring all kinds of strange and unusual stories. After a survey, the TBS network convinced Tsuburaya Productions to add more giant monsters, as children were intensely interested in them, since Godzilla (Gojira) and Gamera were all the rage at the time (the first \"Kaiju Boom\" took off after \"Ultra Q\" became an enormous hit). Much like \"The X-Files\", the series features continuing characters who investigate strange supernatural phenomena, including giant monsters, aliens, ghosts, and various other threats.\n\nThe original planned title of this project was \"Unbalance\", and was subsequently rechristened \"Ultra Q\" mostly due to the word \"Ultra\" gaining popularity due to the Japanese gymnast Gold Medal recipient in the 1964 Summer Olympics using a technique named \"Ultra C\". The series began production in 1964, with the premiere set for January 1966. At the time, this was the most expensive television series ever produced in Japan. The \"Q\" stands for \"Question\" and also tied with another hit TBS series, \"Obake no Q-tarō\", an animated series based on the manga by Fujiko Fujio.\n\n\nBecause of his stature as a filmmaker, and with his close relationship with Toho (they were investors in, and on the Board of Directors at, Tsuburaya Productions), Eiji Tsuburaya was ordered by his crew to take what they needed from the prop warehouse, where the various props from his films were stored, for use on the series. The large Manda prop was used for the dragon Kairyu (while the head was used as the front portion of a Viking ship seen in episode 12), as well as the giant octopus prop from \"Frankenstein vs. Baragon\" became Sudar, while the Maguma suit from \"Gorath\" was repurposed as Todora. Other suits and props were refurbished to play some of the monsters, such as Godzilla for Gomess, King Kong for Goroh, Baragon for Pagos, and a small, mechanical Rodan prop was stripped down and rebuilt as the bird monsters Litra and Largeus, respectively.\n\n\nIn 1967, \"Ultra Q\" was licensed from Tsuburaya and TBS by CBS Films, producers of \"The Twilight Zone\". For the task of dubbing, CBS hired Film House in Toronto, Canada, what is now DeLuxe Toronto. Tsuburaya provided translated scripts, plus English language opening and closing credits, and a custom, swirling title-card. The series itself was dubbed in its 28-episode entirety. At some point, CBS Films backed out of licensing the series, and it was picked up, along with \"Ultraman\", by United Artists Television, producers of \"The Outer Limits\". Subsequently, United Artists Television hired Titra Studios to dub \"Ultraman\". \"Ultraman\" was syndicated, however, \"Ultra Q\" was not, due to being in black-and-white at a time when most television was switching to color. After \"Ultraman\" finished its run in syndication, audio and film masters, and other materials, for both series went into storage, eventually finding their way into the MGM vaults, after MGM acquired United Artists in 1980.\n\nInitially it was commonly believed, even by Tsuburaya Productions, that only one episode, Episode 3 (\"Gift From Outer Space\"), was dubbed into English as a pilot. Over the last decade, other episodes have been discovered in the hands of U.S. private collectors on the 16mm film format.\n\nIn 2003, a weekly radio drama series was produced called \"The Ultra Q Club\". It featured voice acting from the original \"Ultra Q\" cast.\n\nIn the years following the show's original run, a live action film called \"\" was released in 1990. In 2004, a new series called \"\" was produced, while another series called \"Neo Ultra Q\" began airing in early 2013.\n\nThe original concept of the show (when it was going to be called \"Unbalance\") was ultimately used for a 13-episode horror anthology series entitled \"Horror Theater Unbalance\" that was produced by Tsuburaya Productions in 1973.\n\nVarious \"Ultra Q\" monsters were reused or redressed for various monsters in \"Ultraman\". Kemur and Ragon (both of them now giant-sized) returned, while the Garamon suit was reused and repaired to serve as Pigmon. Other suits were altered to play other monsters, such as Peguila being altered into Chandorah, Kemur being altered into Alien Zetton, Pagos being altered into Neronga (and later Magular and Gabora), while the head of the Cicada Man was modified to become the head of Alien Baltan. Finally, Peter's suit was modified to become that of Gesura.\n\nShout! Factory released the complete series of \"Ultra Q\" on DVD on August 13, 2013. In July 2019, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that it had acquired most of the Ultraman library from Tsuburaya Productions through Indigo Entertainment, including 1,100 episodes and 20 films, and will release \"Ultra Q\" and the 1966 \"Ultraman\" on Blu-ray in North America on October 15, 2019 in standard and steelbook editions.\n\n"}

He left before completing a degree. Afterward he worked in the architectural office Behrens and Neumark. Until 1914 he was coworker in the office of Heinz Lassen in Bremen. Later he led the planning office for Zeppelinhallenbau in Berlin Staaken. Beginning in 1919 he was member of the Arbeitsrat für Kunst and November Group, worked as independent architect and town planner and published numerous theoretical writings over art, architecture and town construction.\nIn 1929 Hilberseimer was hired by Hannes Meyer to teach at the Bauhaus at Dessau, Germany. In July 1933 Hilberseimer and Wassily Kandinsky were the two members of the Bauhaus that the Gestapo identified as problematically left-wing. Like many members of the Bauhaus, he fled Germany for America. He arrived in 1938 to work for Mies van der Rohe in Chicago while heading the department of urban planning at IIT College of Architecture. Hilberseimer also became director of Chicago's city planning office.\n\nStreet hierarchy was first elaborated by Ludwig Hilberseimer in his book \"City Plan\", 1927. Hilberseimer emphasized safety for school-age children to walk to school while increasing the speed of the vehicular circulation system.\n\nBeginning in 1929 at the Bauhaus, Hilberseimer developed studies concerning town construction for the decentralization of large cities. Against the background of the economic and political fall of the Weimar Republic he developed a universal and global adaptable planning system (The new town center, 1944), which planned a gradual dissolution of major cities and a complete penetration of landscape and settlement. He proposed that in order to create a sustainable relationship between humans, industry, and nature, human habitation should be built in a way to secure all people against all disasters and crises.\n\nHis most notable built project is Lafayette Park, Detroit, an urban renewal project designed in cooperation with architect Mies van der Rohe and landscape architect Alfred Caldwell.\n\nThe Ludwig Karl Hilberseimer Papers collection, including drawings, photographs, and other printerial material, is held by the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries in the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n"}

Railroad was built on today's Bulevar Cara Lazara (Tsar Lazar Boulevard); and rail station was built on today's corner of streets Vere Pavlović, Puškinova and Bulevar Cara Lazara. It was torn down in 1964, after a new railroad through town was built in Salajka and Podbara neighborhoods.\n\nWork on buildings in Liman was started in the early 1960s, and four parts of the settlement were developed chronologically. Liman I with University campus was started first; and Liman IV was still being built up towards the end of the 1990s.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1989, Liman was one of the seven municipalities of Novi Sad City. The municipality included part of the neighborhood of Liman, as well as neighborhoods of Grbavica, Adamovićevo Naselje and Ribarsko ostrvo.\n\nLiman consists of four parts:\n\nThere are no residential houses in this neighbourhood. Liman is built in communist times, so there are many communist-style high-rise buildings built.\n\nSituated on the left bank of the Danube river, Liman possess many water sports clubs and beaches. There are Štrand (the world-famous river beach located in Liman II) and Bećarac beaches, two small recreational marinas, rowing club and Sunčani kej (The Sunny Quay), next to Danube river, popular for pedestrians and cyclists. Sunčani kej stretches from Podbara to Liman III. There is also Liman park and University park (which is used for campers during EXIT festival) and two football pitches of FK Kabel.\n\nMost facilities of the University of Novi Sad are within the area of University campus in Liman I, but also a couple of dormitories are in Liman III. Liman I was started as a housing project for professors of the University of Novi Sad.\n\nIn mid-2005 estimation by city's registry Liman had 34,234 inhabitants, including: \n\nLiman is part of Novi Sad municipality, and it is divided into five local communities:\n\n\n\n"}

With the latter, after the 0–0 Copa Libertadores game against Club Deportivo El Nacional on 12 February 2004, he tested positive for cocaine, being suspended from football for six months. He blamed the coca tea, widely drunk in the Andean countries as a medicine which alleviates the effects of altitude, and got the shortest suspension for this kind of cases (this specific match was played at 2,800 meters above sea level, in Quito).\n\nEguren arrived at Hammarby IF from Norwegian club Rosenborg BK, on loan during the later part of the 2006 season and, on 5 December 2006, signed a three-year contract with the Swedish side, where he quickly became a fan favourite.\n\nOn 30 January 2008, Eguren joined Villarreal CF of La Liga, on loan until the end of the campaign. Almost immediately cast into the starting XI, he partnered Marcos Senna in centre midfield as the \"Yellow Submarine\" obtained its best position ever in the top flight by finishing second; in May the Spaniards decided to make the move permanent, and the player penned a three-year deal.\n\nDuring 2008–09, more of the same: Eguren was, alongside Senna, an everpresent fixture, and the Uruguayan scored his first goal for the club in a 3–3 home draw against Getafe CF (with the Madrid side leading 0–3 at the half-hour mark). He played 32 league matches in his first full season.\n\nIn late January 2010, as he had lost his defensive midfielder position to youth graduate Bruno, Eguren was loaned to S.S. Lazio. However, the move was cancelled days later, after the player did not pass his medical.\n\nAnxious for playing time in order to secure a spot on the national squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Eguren signed with reigning Swedish champions AIK Fotboll on 19 February 2010. According to their director of football Björn Wesström, the agreement was technically not a loan deal as the player had no contractual obligations with Villareal until 1 July 2010 – however, he was due to return to Spain since he still had 12 months left of his contract. In early March, it was decided by the club to put the player under police protection, after he was harassed while training by fans of former side Hammarby, a fierce rival to AIK; he usually operated as a defensive midfielder previously, but manager Mikael Stahre preferred using him in an attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward role.\n\nIn late July 2010, Eguren returned to Spain but not to Villarreal, signing a three-year contract with fellow league team Sporting de Gijón. He contributed with 19 games and two goals in his second year, but the Asturians suffered relegation.\n\nIn July 2013, Eguren signed a one-and-a-half year deal with Brazil's Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras. He confessed that his changing of club happened because he did not have enough playing time at his previous team Club Libertad, where he played second-fiddle to Pablo Guiñazú.\n\nEguren made his debut for Uruguay during the 2001 Copa América, entering the pitch in the 63rd minute of a 1–0 win against Bolivia, and added a further two appearances in the competition. On 28 May 2008, after a five-year absence, he scored his first goal for the \"Charrúas\", netting in a 2–2 friendly with Norway in Oslo.\n\nEgurén was also selected for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, playing once for the semi-finalists (three minutes in the group stage 0–0 draw against France). Always as a substitute, he was then used regularly in the 2011 Copa América as nation won its 15th continental tournament.\n\nDuring most of his career in Europe, Eguren did not count as a foreign player, due to the fact he was married to a Swedish woman. He did not master the Swedish language however.\n\nEguren is a different footballer: besides his musical likes, ranging from Bob Dylan to Pink Floyd, and his literary ones (he is a fan of compatriots Mario Benedetti and Eduardo Galeano), he speaks openly about politics, admiring president José Mujica, and is in favour of the legalization of marijuana which, according to him, would represent more tax revenues to governments.\n\nAIK\n\nPalmeiras\n\nUruguay\n\n"}

{"id": "2242471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242471", "title": "Property dualism", "text": "Property dualism\n\nProperty dualism describes a category of positions in the philosophy of mind which hold that, although the world is composed of just one kind of substance—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: physical properties and mental properties. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) exist in, or naturally supervene upon, certain physical substances (namely brains).\n\nSubstance dualism, on the other hand, is the view that there exist in the universe two fundamentally different kinds of substance: physical (matter) and non-physical (mind or consciousness), and subsequently also two kinds of properties which adhere in those respective substances. Substance dualism is thus more susceptible to the mind–body problem. Both substance and property dualism are opposed to reductive physicalism.\n\nEmergentism is the idea that increasingly complex structures in the world give rise to the \"emergence\" of novel properties that are something over and above (i.e. cannot be reduced to) their more basic constituents (see \"Supervenience\"). The concept of emergence dates back to the late 19th century. John Stuart Mill notably argued for an emergentist conception of science in his 1843 \"System of Logic\".\n\nApplied to the mind/body relation, emergent materialism is another way of describing the non-reductive physicalist conception of the mind that asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e., organized in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge.\n\nNon-reductive physicalism is the predominant contemporary form of property dualism according to which mental properties are mapped to neurobiological properties, but are not reducible to them. Non-reductive physicalism asserts that mind is not ontologically reducible to matter, in that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between the properties of mind and matter. It asserts that while mental states are physical in that they are caused by physical states, they are not ontologically reducible to physical states. No mental state is the same one thing as some physical state, nor is any mental state composed merely from physical states and phenomena. \n\nMost contemporary non-reductive physicalists subscribe to a position called anomalous monism (or something very similar to it). Unlike epiphenomenalism, which renders mental properties causally redundant, anomalous monists believe that mental properties make a causal difference to the world. The position was originally put forward by Donald Davidson in his 1970 paper \"Mental Events\", which stakes an identity claim between mental and physical tokens based on the notion of supervenience.\n\nAnother argument for non-reductive physicalism has been expressed by John Searle, who is the advocate of a distinctive form of physicalism he calls biological naturalism. His view is that although mental states are not ontologically reducible to physical states, they are causally reducible (see causality). He believes the mental will ultimately be explained through neuroscience. This worldview does not necessarily fall under \"property dualism\", and therefore does not necessarily make him a \"property dualist\". He has acknowledged that \"to many people\" his views and those of property dualists look a lot alike. But he thinks the comparison is misleading.\n\nEpiphenomenalism is a doctrine about mental-physical causal relations which holds that one or more mental states and their properties are the by-products (or epiphenomena) of the states of a closed physical system, and are not causally reducible to physical states (do not have any influence on physical states). According to this view mental properties are as such real constituents of the world, but they are causally impotent; while physical causes give rise to mental properties like sensations, volition, ideas, etc., such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing further - they are causal dead ends.\n\nThe position is credited to English biologist Thomas Huxley (Huxley 1874), who analogised mental properties to the whistle on a steam locomotive. The position found favour amongst scientific behaviourists over the next few decades, until behaviourism itself fell to the cognitive revolution in the 1960s. Recently, epiphenomenalism has gained popularity with those struggling to reconcile non-reductive physicalism and mental causation.\n\nIn the paper \"Epiphenomenal Qualia\" and later \"What Mary Didn't Know\" Frank Jackson made the so-called knowledge argument against physicalism. The thought experiment was originally proposed by Jackson as follows:\n\nJackson continued:\n\nPanpsychism is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since\nit regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules — as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of complex structure in a compound object. So long as the \"reduction\" of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not strictly a form of property dualism; otherwise it is.\n\nDavid Chalmers has expressed sympathy for panpsychism (or a modified variant, panprotopsychism) as a possible resolution to the hard problem of consciousness, though he regards the combination problem as an important obstacle for the theory. Other philosophers who have taken interest in the view include Thomas Nagel, Galen Strawson, Timothy Sprigge, William Seager, and Philip Goff.\n\nKripke has a well-known argument for some kind of property dualism. Using the concept of rigid designators, he states that if dualism is logically possible, then it is the case.\n\nSubjective idealism, proposed in the eighteenth century by Bishop Berkeley, is an ontic doctrine that directly opposes materialism or physicalism. It does not admit ontic property dualism, but does admit epistemic property dualism. It is rarely advocated by philosophers nowadays.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2242489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242489", "title": "Agrafa", "text": "Agrafa\n\nAgrafa (, ) is a mountainous region in Evrytania and Karditsa regional units in mainland Greece, consisting mainly of small villages. It is the southernmost part of the Pindus range. There is also a municipality with the same name, the Municipality of Agrafa, but it covers only a small percentage of the area.\n\nThe Agrafa region is famous for its complete autonomy throughout the entire years of Ottoman occupation of central Greece. The word \"ágrafa\" literally translates to unwritten, which means \"unregistered\" or uncharted; because the Ottomans were unable to conquer this region, the area and its population were not recorded in the Sultan's tax register. As a result the people were usually free to conduct their business and customs as they pleased without Ottoman influence.\n\nThe fiercely independent spirit of its people, known as \"Agrafiotes,\" is matched by a harsh and forbidding landscape. The central Agrafiotis River valley is surrounded on three sides by a steep 2,000-metre wall of mountains, and on its south side the river drains via a series of narrow and often impassable gorges into the man-made Lake Kremasta. The other great river of Agrafa, Tavropos (aka Megdovas), feeds two man-made lakes: Plastiras (N) and Kremasta (S).\n\nMost of the surrounding forests in the region were controlled by Greek Orthodox monasteries for many hundreds of years and through Ottoman rule. The residents of the Agrafa purchased tracts of land from the monasteries hundreds of years ago and these forests remain in the communal hands of the current inhabitants.\n\nAgrafa was a centre of literacy during the 400 years of Ottoman rule. Unlike the majority of Greeks, many Agrafiotes can trace their family histories back for generations.\n\nIn the 20th century, a lot of Agrafiotes left their villages and settled in the major metropolitan cities in Greece as well as in the United States, Canada, Australia and Germany, seeking an escape from the abject poverty and lack of opportunities in the area. The migration from the region first began in the 1920s and nearly ceased after the military junta which had ruled Greece from 1967–1974 was toppled.\n\nBefore modernization, most people's occupations in the Agrafa involved harvesting nuts and fruits from orchards, farming, shepherding, and textile manufacturing. Most of the produce from the Agrafa are traditional cold weather crops or crops which can survive in poor soil. The proceeds of the timber sales from the forests purchased from the monasteries continue to benefit the community as a whole.\n\nThe most famous person from the Agrafa and the driving force behind modernization was the colonel Nikolaos Plastiras, who was elected prime minister of Greece after the Civil War. It was his vision to create a hydroelectric dam in the region so that nearly all of mainland Greece, excluding the Peloponnese, would be supplied with electricity, particularly the many fractured villages and rural communities. A spin-off from this project was the mass irrigation system developed to supply the farmers in the plains of Thessaly with water and increase the yields of cash crops such as cotton, and also the creation of Lake Plastira which has met increasing tourist development in the last decades.\n\nConstruction began during the 1950s. The Plastiras Dam contributed to the economic development of Greece. The majority of the workers on this project were Agrafiotes themselves. The residents of the region enjoy free water up until this day.\n\n\n"}

The Dreadlord was certain that these adventurers were called upon to slay him and he began gathering armies of evil creatures to aid him. The town was overrun by monsters and the inhabitants abandoned it. With the help of the Silver Blades, they succeeded in driving the monsters out of the town and back to the castle. Oswulf was still determined not to kill his own brother, however. The Silver Blades set out to research a spell and when cast, it encased the entire valley in a glacier. Everything inside became frozen, but was still alive. Oswulf sacrificed himself so his spirit could guard the castle.\n\nA few of the Dreadlord's followers were beyond the glacier's effects and began attempts to get through the ice, but failed. 15 years ago, they formed a group known as the Black Circle and succeeded in breaking the spell. The glacier began to melt. As the ice melted, many miners noticed the old mines of Verdigris were once again accessible and founded the town of New Verdigris. The mines contained vast amounts of gems. As the miners descended to the lower levels, monsters that had been frozen for over 300 years began to emerge and once again took over the mines.\n\nIn desperation, the miners took all their gems to the Well of Knowledge, which is said to grant wishes and provide information for those who dropped treasure into it. The party was then summoned to the town of New Verdigris by the Well of Knowledge at the wish of the townspeople. They need the party to protect them from the monsters and so begins the story of the Secret of the Silver Blades.\n\nThe party's objective is to adventure through the mountain region near Verdigris, entering areas such as the ruins of Old Verdigris, the Well of Knowledge, the mines, the crevasses, and eventually to the Dreadlord's castle. The party will face off against an evil group of humans called the Black Circle, many kinds of monsters in the mines and crevasses, and finally against the lich the Dreadlord himself.\n\nTo play Secret of the Silver Blades, one simply needs to create characters and form a party. The gameplay basics are identical to all games in the series. Characters can also be imported from \"Pool of Radiance\" and \"Curse of the Azure Bonds\".\n\n\"Secret of the Silver Blades\" is similar to its two predecessors in gameplay and graphics. There is no overworld in this game, however. It takes place entirely in the first person maps. Graphics did improve slightly, though everything was still drawn in 16 colors.\n\nThe game includes some new features introduced with \"Champions of Krynn\", and adds a difficulty selector that the player can use to change the power of the enemy creatures. The game world was the largest yet for a Gold Box game, and it included cut scene illustrations of the story. It is the first Gold Box game in which random encounters do not stop after a certain point.\n\nMages have the ability to use spells up to level 7, while clerics can reach level 6 spells.\n\nThe arrow keys are conveniently usable to select menu options as opposed to using hotkeys, which was the only way in earlier titles, though the hotkey option is still available.\n\nThere are only two known versions for MS-DOS:\n\nLike most of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons computer games, this game contains only one song. It was composed by John Halbleib, and was his last game when the developers replaced him with Tom Wahl.\n\n\"Secret of the Silver Blades\" was very successful, with SSI selling 167,214 copies. It was the last Gold Box game to sell more than 100,000. Scorpia of \"Computer Gaming World\" in 1990 wrote that \"\"Secret of the Silver Blades\" could easily have been sub-titled 'Hackmania'\" because of the game's emphasis of combat, and stated that it was the most linear of the Gold Box series. She liked the game's story, and concluded that it was \"a typical product in the Forgotten Realms series\", most appealing to fans of Gold Box or hack and slash games. In 1993 she stated that it was the \"most boring\" Gold Box game and \"for hard-core slicer/dicers only\". The game was reviewed in 1990 in \"Dragon\" #163 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. According to GameSpy, \"\"Secret of the Silver Blades\" would never reach the \"classic\" status of much of SSI's previous work\".\n\nBritish gaming magazine Amiga Action gave \"Secret of the Silver Blades\" an overall score of 87%, acknowledging that the game is very similar to its predecessors, but goes on to state, \"the good thing is that they follow on from each other very well.\" and \"[\"Silver Blades\" is] one of the best RPGs around. If you miss this one then you're a fool.\" Amiga Action also praised new features in the game such as the ability to port characters from previous installments and new monsters, rating it above \"Champions of Krynn\", an earlier installment in the series.\n"}

He is the host of syndicated radio show \"The Mark Levin Show\", as well as \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" on Fox News. Levin worked in the administration of President Ronald Reagan and was a chief of staff for Attorney General Edwin Meese. He is the former president of the Landmark Legal Foundation, a best-selling author of seven books, and contributes commentary to various media outlets such as \"National Review Online\". Since 2015, Levin has been editor-in-chief of the Conservative Review and is known for his incendiary commentary.\n\nHe has been described as \"right-wing\" and \"conservative\". He is known for his harsh criticisms of Democrats and encouragement of primary challenges to congressional Republicans that he considers to be \"RINO\". He endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and declared himself \"Never Trump\", but reluctantly endorsed Donald Trump after Trump won the Republican nomination. Since the start of the Trump presidency, Levin's commentary has turned staunchly pro-Trump.\n\nMark Reed Levin, one of three boys, was born in Philadelphia to a Jewish family, and grew up in Erdenheim as well as Elkins Park. His father, Jack E. Levin (1925–2018), was the author of several books. He graduated from Cheltenham High School after three years in 1974. Skipping his senior year of high school, Levin enrolled at Temple University Ambler and graduated \"summa cum laude\" and Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in Political Science in 1977 at age 19. Levin won election to the Cheltenham school board in 1977 on a platform of reducing property taxes. In 1980, Levin earned a J.D. from Temple University Beasley School of Law.\n\nLevin worked for Texas Instruments after law school. Beginning in 1981, Levin served as an adviser to several members of President Ronald Reagan's cabinet. Levin began at ACTION, the federal agency that oversaw VISTA and other volunteer agencies, before serving as deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education at the U.S. Department of Education and deputy solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior. He eventually became the associate director of presidential personnel and ultimately chief of staff to Attorney General Edwin Meese. \n\nAfter leaving the Reagan administration, Levin practiced law in the private sector. In 1991, Levin joined public interest law firm Landmark Legal Foundation, which specializes in constitutional law, advocating for free enterprise, and limiting governmental power. At Landmark, Levin served as director of legal policy and the foundation's Washington-based Center for Civil Rights before becoming president in 1997. Under Levin's presidency, Landmark Legal filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in 2000 alleging that the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union in the U.S., did not disclose spending on political activity in Internal Revenue Service documentation. Landmark Legal also filed similar complaints with the United States Department of Labor in 2002 regarding NEA and political activity; by 2006, the NEA and smaller American Federation of Teachers had filed new documents with the Labor Department revealing over $100 million combined in political action spending.\n\nFollowing Freedom of Information Act requests in August 2012 of documents that would show if Environmental Protection Agency officials sought to delay regulations until after the 2012 presidential election, federal judge Royce Lamberth ruled in 2015 that although Landmark Legal did not establish that the EPA acted in bad faith, the EPA either carelessly or intentionally neglected Landmark's FOIA request. Lamberth previously ruled in 2013 that the EPA might have attempted to evade Landmark's FOIA request.\n\nIn 2001 the American Conservative Union awarded Levin its Ronald Reagan Award for his work with Landmark Legal.\nPolitico reported in 2014 that Levin received a salary of more than $300,000 per year as president of the non-profit Landmark Legal Foundation, whose donors include the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation and ExxonMobil. In 2018, Levin stepped down as president of Landmark Legal but remained on its board of directors.\n\nLevin began his broadcasting career as a guest on conservative talk radio programs. For many years, he was a frequent contributor of legal opinions to \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\", where Limbaugh referred to him on-air as \"F. Lee Levin\", a tongue-in-cheek reference to the defense attorney F. Lee Bailey. He was also a contributor to \"The Sean Hannity Show\" and eventually got a radio slot of his own on WABC, initially on Sundays beginning in 2002, then in the timeslot following Hannity's program in 2003. Cumulus Media Networks began syndicating \"The Mark Levin Show\" nationally in 2006. Hannity nicknamed Mark Levin \"The Great One.\"\n\nLevin has participated in Freedom Concerts, an annual benefit concert to aid families of fallen soldiers, and uses his radio program to promote aid to military families. Levin is also involved with Move America Forward, a charity that sends care packages to soldiers serving overseas. \n\nOn February 11, 2016, Levin signed a ten-year contract extension with Westwood One, which will take his show through 2025, its 19th year.\n\nOn November 16, 2018, he was inducted to the National Radio Hall of Fame.\n\nSince 2014, Levin has been the founding editor-in-chief of Conservative Review, a multi-platform online television network that later merged with Glenn Beck's terrestrial network TheBlaze in 2018 to form Blaze Media. Programs airing on the network include \"Levin\", \"Roaming Millennial\", \"Truth Be Told\", \"Allie\", \"In the Woods with Phil\", \"Kibbe on Liberty\", \"Louder with Crowder\", \"America Bolling\" and more.\n\nIn November 2017, Fox News announced that it had signed Levin for a weekend show titled \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" to air on Sunday nights at 10:00 p.m. Eastern beginning in February 2018. According to a pre-debut network news release, the program will explore \"the fundamental values and principles undergirding American society, culture, politics, and current events, and their relevance to the nation's future and everyday lives of citizens.\"\n\nLevin authored the 2005 book \"Men In Black: How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America\", in which he advanced his thesis that activist judges on the Supreme Court (from all parts of the political spectrum) have \"legislated from the bench\". \"Commentary\" magazine's Dan Seligman wrote that Levin asks readers \"to identify with 'originalists' who look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers, and to reject the 'activists' who construe the Constitution broadly and are more concerned with getting to their own 'desired outcomes'\". \"Slate\" magazine's Dahlia Lithwick wrote that \"no serious scholar of the court or the Constitution, on the ideological left or right, is going to waste their time engaging Levin's arguments once they've read this book\".\n\n\"\" is a non-fiction work written by Levin in 2007 about his experience of rescuing a dog named Sprite from a local animal shelter.\n\n\"Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto\" was released in 2009, and became a #1 New York Times best seller for eleven of twelve weeks, as well as No. 1 on Nielsen BookScan and No. 2 on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books of 2009. The book includes discussion of a variety of issues that, according to Levin, need to be addressed in the United States. In \"Liberty and Tyranny\" Levin repudiates the use of the term \"progressive\" to describe \"modern Liberals\" and instead argues a proper term should be \"Statist\". \"Liberty and Tyranny\" has sold over one million copies according to Threshold Editions, the book's publisher. Andrew C. McCarthy, in \"The New Criterion\", wrote, \"Levin offers not so much a defense as a plan of attack\" against \"America's Leftist ascendancy\". Other reviewers critiqued the book as \"analysis utterly useless in understanding more than half of the American political landscape\" while opining that \"Levin resorts to the same old misinformation to sell his brand of conservatism\".\n\n\"Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America\" was released in 2012. In \"Ameritopia\", Levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies, the latter of which he refers to as \"statist\", through the works of some of the leading figures in American history. Included are commentaries on works by Plato, Sir Thomas More, Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx, John Locke, Charles de Montesquieu and Alexis de Tocqueville. Conor Friedersdorf's review, published in \"The Atlantic\", criticized the text's argument that statism is based on utopianism, and Carlin Romano, in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", wrote that \"\"Ameritopia\" is really \"Ameritastrophe\". It's disastrously bad from beginning to end.\"\n\nThe 2013 book \"\" suggests eleven new Constitutional amendments. The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list. Hans A. von Spakovsky of \"National Review Online\" called the book \"required reading for conservative bloggers\". Ana Marie Cox, writing in \"The Guardian\", said the book \"contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the US constitution, but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project\" while noting \"the ludicrousness of his specific 'fixes' and the near-impossibility of achieving them\". In \"The Washington Times\", Tenth Amendment Center Executive Director Michael Lotfi criticized Levin's idea as \"the bullet to a loaded revolver pointed at the Constitution\". Also in \"The Washington Times\", Richard W. Rahn wrote, \"If 'The Liberty Amendments' can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions, including constitutional amendments, are needed to increase liberty and prosperity, Mr. Levin will have performed a great national service\". Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in \"Forbes\" that Levin's book used \"weak arguments\".\n\nLevin authored \"Plunder and Deceit: Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future\" in 2015, and \"Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism\" in 2017.\nLevin's \"Unfreedom of the Press\", which was released on May 21, 2019, became the number one best-selling book on Amazon.com three days before its official release, as a result of pre-order sales. \"Unfreedom of the Press\" also became a \"New York Times\" #1 best-seller on June 6, 2019, in the combined print & e-book nonfiction and hardcover nonfiction categories. Lloyd Green was critical of the book in \"The Guardian\" writing that the book \"...is not exactly fan fiction but it can get ahead of itself when discussing the special counsel’s conclusions, ending up sounding like the 'fake news' the author and Trump both purport to abhor.\" Annalisa Quinn wrote in NPR online that \"Along the way, [Levin] looks at \"The New York Times\"' inadequate coverage of the Holocaust (full disclosure: I write freelance pieces for the \"Times\"), and touches on a handful of clear problems in American media, from the often poor distinction between reporting and opinion to the distorting incentives of the Internet.\" Quinn continued, \"But the book is largely filler. Quotations and paraphrasing make up the majority of the book's central chapters. Lengthy and irrelevant block quotes from historians about, say, colonial printing practices... give the book the air of a padded student essay.\" Quinn also wrote, \"[Levin] conducts no interviews, presents no original research, and visits no newsrooms\", and \"When Levin does offer his own analysis, it can approach parody.\" On June 8, 2019, Levin appeared on C-SPAN2's \"Book TV\" to discuss \"Unfreedom of the Press\", \"in which he argued that the press has lowered its standards in providing objective and trustworthy journalism.\"\n\nA 2016 study which sought to measure incendiary discourse on talk radio and TV found that Levin scored highest on its measure of \"outrage\". The study looked at 10 prominent radio and television programs, known for incendiary discourse on political matters, and scored content on the basis of whether it used \"emotional display\", \"misrepresentative exaggeration\", \"mockery\", \"conflagration\", \"slippery slope\", \"insulting\" or \"obscene language\" and other factors, finding that Levin was the radio host who engaged in the most outrage. The study found that he utilized \"outrage speech or behavior at a rate of more than one instance per minute.\" In \"How Democracies Die\", Harvard University political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky write that Mark Levin was among the popular right-wing talk radio hosts who \"helped to legitimate the use of uncivil discourse\" in American politics, and contribute to the erosion of democratic norms.\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", \"constant attacks on Democrats and the left are important components\" of Levin's \"modus operandi.\" According to \"Politico\" in May 2009, Levin pronounced \"almost daily\" that Obama \"was a failure, a liar and a \"statist\" who is trying to destroy individual freedom.\" In June 2017, Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being \"a radical Marxist who believes in violence.\" According to Rutgers University political scientist Stephen Eric Bronner, Levin tends to use \"socialism\" as a \"catch-all term to condemn any policy that strengthens the social welfare function of the state.\" In July 2014, he called Jon Stewart \"a knee-jerk idiot\", and suggested that Stewart was a self-hating Jew. He has stated that \"Nancy Pelosi’s politics comes as close to a form of modern-day fascism as I’ve ever seen.\" In January 2019, he called Pelosi \"America’s first fascist\" when she refused to provides billions in funding to President Trump for a border wall. Levin has also mocked how Pelosi looks, referred to Beto O'Rourke as a \"weak man\", and called Dick Blumenthal a \"pathetic, loathsome liar.\"\n\nHe has criticized Republicans – including Paul Ryan, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Mitch McConnell – with whom he disagrees. He sometimes refers to these people as RINOs. In July 2009, Levin called former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum a \"complete and utter fraud\". Levin endorsed Orrin Hatch when he faced a primary challenge in 2012, but later apologized for his endorsement when Hatch said that he would be willing to support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Since then, he endorsed a number of Republican primary challengers to incumbent Republican senators. Levin supported the Tea Party Patriots' campaign to \"fire\" House Speaker John Boehner. Earlier in 2010, Levin criticized Glenn Beck for his criticism of congressional Republicans. He has referred to Mitt Romney as an \"ass\" and called CNN host Brian Stelter a \"creep\".\n\nLevin supported U.S. Representative Mo Brooks in his campaign in the 2017 Alabama special election against incumbent Luther Strange, who had received a temporary appointment earlier that year.\n\nLevin strongly defended former EPA head Scott Pruitt while he was under a dozen separate ethics investigations. Levin said Pruitt's \"policies on the whole have been outstanding,\" and \"I don't throw good people under the bus because the left targets them.\"\n\nDuring the 2012 election cycle, Levin's show was paid at least $757,000 in sponsorship by the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity to run ads for the group. After the sponsorship ended, Levin began doing ads for the Tea Party Patriots. In 2014 the \"Senate Conservatives Fund paid at least $427,000 to Simon & Schuster to purchase copies of one of Levin's books in September and October of 2013.\" During the same period, Levin frequently promoted the group, which has funded primary challengers of Senate Republicans, on his radio show and Facebook page. Levin did not disclose that the group had made $427,000 of purchases of his book.\n\nLevin endorsed Orrin Hatch when Levin was being sponsored by Americans for Prosperity (AFP) which also endorsed Hatch. Levin withdrew his endorsement of Hatch when Levin was being sponsored by the Tea Party Patriots, a group that funded challengers to Hatch; and Levin endorsed primary challengers when the Senate Conservatives Fund, a group which funded primary challengers to incumbent Republicans, purchased $427,000 worth of his books. Levin dismissed the allegations that he engages in \"pay-to-play\".\n\nIn 2009, Levin described as \"absolutely right\" the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care. In 2011, a caller to Levin's show, claiming to be a neurosurgeon, said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments. Levin said to the caller, \"so Sarah Palin was right.\" The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false. Levin satirically noted the similarities between a gathering of \"hand-picked\" supporters of the Affordable Care Act chosen by the Obama administration to Nazi \"Sturmabteilung\" or \"Brownshirts\" drawing comparisons of the propaganda techniques of the two groups.\n\nLevin stated in 2013 that \"the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government\" and called President Obama a Muslim Brotherhood \"sympathizer\".\n\nIn February 2015, Levin stated that President Obama of \"seeking to destroy Israel\" because \"Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism.\" Levin also blamed Obama for the Ebola crisis, saying \"the political policies of this administration which opens the door wide to people from the poorest parts of the world. We don't know who they are, we don't know if they have diseases.\"\n\nIn March 2016, Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Over a month after Donald Trump was nominated, in September 2016, Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Trump in the general election, following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the \"Never Trump\" camp and would never vote for Trump. He qualified his support by stating that, \"I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say.\"\n\nIn October 2019, while Trump was the subject of an impeachment inquiry resulting in his impeachment, Levin said that \"While he's been president there hasn't even been a hint of scandal. Not a hint!\"<ref name=\"Baragona_10/22/2019\"></ref>\n\nIn March 2017, Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used \"police state\" surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The \"Associated Press\" said that Levin \"voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower\". Levin protested the \"AP\" report vigorously, demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included \"The New York Times\" and other newspapers. His statement was reprinted by \"Breitbart News\" and reportedly became the basis of President Trump's unfounded Trump Tower wiretapping allegations. In September 2017, reports emerged of a court-ordered Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) wiretap on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort; while certain Trump supporters alleged that this surveillance vindicated Levin and Trump's unsupported assertions, \"The Atlantic\" noted: \"This is not true – Trump claimed he had been the subject of Obama-ordered, politically motivated surveillance, for which there remains no evidence.\"\n\nLevin has said that there is a \"coup\" occurring against the presidency of Donald Trump waged by Obama loyalists. Levin's coup claim was referring to investigations of the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and of alleged obstruction of justice by Trump. He has suggested that former FBI Director James Comey used the Trump-Russia dossier \"to blackmail the president.\" He has claimed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller engaged in a \"Deep State\" coup against Trump.\n\nIn February 2018, Levin said the Nunes Memo shows \"Hillary Clinton paid for a warrant\" and \"Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians...it appears the FBI at the senior-most levels colluded with the Russians too.\" \n\nIn August 2018, Levin stated that Mueller is a \"greater threat to this Republic and Constitution than anything Vladimir Putin did during the [2016] campaign.\" When Mueller released a report summarizing the finding of his Special Counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Levin called the report \"crap\". He complained that Obama was not interviewed in the probe. He said that Trump could not have engaged in obstruction of justice, because the probe should never have happened.\n\nAfter President Trump pressed the President of Ukraine to start an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Levin strongly defended Trump's actions. Asked on \"Fox & Friends\" whether Levin was \"okay\" with Trump asking a foreign leader for \"dirt\" on Biden, Levin lashed out at the \"Fox & Friends\" host and repeatedly shouted there was \"no problem\" with what Trump did. Shortly thereafter, Trump praised Levin and retweeted more than 20 tweets by viewers praising Levin. Levin also accused Joe Biden of being the one who \"did something illegal\", though he did not provide evidence or elaborate.\n\nIn 2014, Levin claimed that the Bush administration's original WMD rationale for the Iraq War had been vindicated by citing reports of U.S. soldiers in Iraq that were wounded by the decayed remnants of Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons arsenal. The remnants in question were degraded and unusable chemical weapons shells from the 1980s. Levin faulted the Bush administration for not doing more to publicize these remnants of Iraq's former WMD program.\n\n"}

{"id": "2242519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242519", "title": "Princeton Theology", "text": "Princeton Theology\n\nThe Princeton Theology was a tradition of conservative, Christian, Reformed and Presbyterian theology at Princeton Theological Seminary lasting from the founding of that institution in 1812 until the 1920s, after which, due to the increasing influence of theological liberalism at the school, the last Princeton theologians left to found Westminster Theological Seminary. The appellation has special reference to certain theologians, from Archibald Alexander to B.B. Warfield, and their particular blend of teaching, which together with its Old School Presbyterian Calvinist orthodoxy sought to express a warm Evangelicalism and a high standard of scholarship. W. Andrew Hoffecker argues that they strove to \"maintain a balance between the intellectual and affective elements in the Christian faith.\"\n\nBy extension, the Princeton theologians include those predecessors of Princeton Theological Seminary who prepared the groundwork of that theological tradition, and the successors who tried, and failed, to preserve the seminary against the inroads of a program to better conform that graduate school to \"Broad Evangelicalism\", which was imposed upon it by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.\n\nWilliam Tennent, Sr. of the Log College, Gilbert Tennent and William Tennent, Jr. of the College of New Jersey, and Jonathan Edwards of Princeton University are considered predecessors to the Princeton theologians. Archibald Alexander, Charles Hodge, A. A. Hodge, and B. B. Warfield were major figures promoting the Princeton Theology. The quarterly journal \"Biblical Repertory\", later renamed the \"Princeton Review\", was an important publication promoting this school. Albert Baldwin Dod, Lyman Hotchkiss Atwater, and John Breckinridge were frequent contributors of this journal. Geerhardus Vos, J. Gresham Machen, Cornelius Van Til, Oswald T. Allis, Robert Dick Wilson, and John Murray were notable successors of the Princeton theologians.\n\nOf these, only Machen and Wilson represented the American Presbyterian tradition that was directly influenced by the Princeton Theology. Vos and Van Til were Dutch Reformed. Murray was a Scot, but a student under Machen at Princeton who later followed him to Westminster Theological Seminary. Murray and Van Til were both ministers in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, which Machen founded.\n\nMark Noll, an evangelical Church historian, sees the \"grand motifs\" of the Princeton Theology as being \nDevotion to the Bible, concern for religious experience, sensitivity to the American experience, and full employment of Presbyterian confessions, seventeenth-century Reformed systematicians, and the Scottish philosophy of Common Sense.\n\nAllegiance to the Bible as the supreme norm was common in the 19th century, and not a distinctive of the Princeton theologians. Princeton was, however, distinguished by the academic rigor with which it approached the Bible. Alexander and his successors sought to defend the doctrines they found in the Bible against rival claims from learned scholars. Charles Hodge saw faithfulness to the Bible as the best defense against higher criticism as well as the overly experiential focus of Friedrich Schleiermacher.\n\nPrinceton theologians saw themselves in the line of Reformed Protestantism stretching back to John Calvin. The dogmatics of Francis Turretin, a Reformed scholastic of the 17th century, was the primary textbook of theology at Princeton. In a world which increasingly valued the new over the old, these theologians preferred the theological systems of the 16th and 17th centuries. The various Reformed confessions were viewed as harmonious voices of a common theological tradition, which was simply a distillation of the teaching of the Bible.\n"}

It rises in the Zard Kuh mountains of the Bakhtiari district in the Zagros Range, receiving many tributaries, such as the Dez and the Kuhrang, before passing through the capital of the Khuzestan Province of Iran, the city of Ahvaz before emptying to its mouth into Arvand Rud (Shatt al-Arab).\n\nThe Karun continues toward the Persian Gulf, forking into two primary branches on its delta - the Bahmanshir and the Haffar - that join the Arvand Rud, emptying into the Persian Gulf. The important Island of Abadan is located between these two branches of the Karun. The port city of Khorramshahr is divided from the Island of Abadan by the Haffar branch.\n\nJuris Zarins and other scholars have identified the Karun as one of the four rivers of Eden, the others being the Tigris, the Euphrates, and either the Wadi Al-Batin or the Karkheh.\n\nIn early classical times, the Karun was known as the Pasitigris. The modern medieval and modern name, Karun, is a corruption of the name Kuhrang, which is still maintained by one of the two primary tributaries of the Karun.\nJ. G. Lorimer also records in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf that it was known by the name \"Dujail,\" which could be translated \"Little Tigris,\" to medieval Arab and Persian geographers.\n\nIt originates in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran, on the slopes of Zard-Kuh. The river flows south and west through several prominent mountain ridges, and receives additional water from the Vanak on the south bank and the Bazoft on the north. These tributaries add to the catchment of the river above the Karun-4 Dam. downstream, the Karun widens into the reservoir formed by the Karun-3 Dam.\n\nThe Khersan flows into an arm of the reservoir from the southeast. The river passes through this reservoir and flows through a narrow canyon, now in a northwest direction, past Izeh, eventually winding into the Sussan Plain. The Karun then turns north into the reservoir of Shahid Abbaspour Dam (Karun-1), which floods the river's defile to the southwest. The Karun flows southwest into the impoundment of Masjed Soleyman Dam (Karun-2), then turns northwest. Finally, it leaves the foothills and flows south past Shushtar and its confluence with the Dez. It then bends southwest, bisecting the city of Ahvaz, and south through farmland to its mouth on the Arvand Roud at Khorramshahr, where its water, together with that of the Tigris and Euphrates, turns sharply southeast to flow to the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe largest river by discharge in Iran, the Karun River's watershed covers in parts of two Iranian provinces. The river is around long and has an average discharge of . The largest city on the river is Ahvaz, with over 1.3 million inhabitants. Other important cities include Shushtar, Khorramshahr (a port), Masjed-Soleyman, and Izeh.\n\nMuch of Khuzestan's transport and resources are connected in one way or another to the Karun. Since the British first discovered oil at Masjed-Soleyman, the Karun has been an important route for the transport of petroleum to the Persian Gulf, and remains an important commercial waterway.\nWater from the Karun provides irrigation to over of the surrounding plain and a further are planned to receive water.\n\nThe Karun River valley was once inhabited by the Elamite civilization which rose about 2,700 BC. At several points in history, Mesopotamian civilizations such as Ur and Babylon overthrew the Elamites and gained control of the Karun and its surroundings in modern Khuzestan. However, the Elamite empire lasted until about 640 BC, when the Assyrians overran it. The city of Susa, near the modern city of Shush between the Dez and Karkheh rivers, was one of their largest before it was destroyed by the invaders.\n\nIn two of several competing theories about the origins and location of the Garden of Eden, the Karun is presumed to be the Gihon River that is described in the Biblical book of \"Genesis\". The strongest of these theories, propounded by archaeologist Juris Zarins, places the Garden of Eden at the northern tip of the Persian Gulf, fed by the four rivers Tigris, Euphrates, Gihon (Karun) and Pishon (Wadi Al-Batin).\n\nThe name of the river is derived from the mountain peak, Kuhrang, that serves as its source.\nThe famous silent film documentary, \"Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life\" (1925), tells the story of the Bakhtiari tribe crossing this river with 50,000 people and 500,000 animals.\n\nIt was here during the Iran–Iraq War that the Iranians stopped the early Iraqi advance. With its limited military stocks, Iran unveiled its \"human wave\" assaults which used thousands of Basij (Popular Mobilization Army or People's Army) volunteers.\n\nIn September 2009, three districts of Basra province in southern Iraq were declared disaster areas as a result of Iran's construction of new dams on the Karun. The new dams resulted in high levels of salinity in the Arvand Roud, which destroyed farm areas and threatened livestock. Civilians in the area were forced to evacuate.\n\nThere are a number of dams on the Karun River, mainly built to generate hydroelectric power and provide flood control. Gotvand Dam, Masjed Soleyman Dam, Karun-1 (Shahid Abbaspour Dam), Karun-3, and Karun-4, most of them owned by the Iran Water and Power Resources Development Co., are all on the main stem. Karun-2 would potentially be located in the Sussan Plain between Shahid Abbaspour and Karun-3, but the project is still under consideration because of fear of submerging archaeological sites.\n\nA Karun-5 dam upstream of Karun-4 has also been proposed. The Masjed Soleyman, Shahid Abbaspour, and Karun-3 dams each generate 1,000-2,000 MW of power to service the peaking power sector of Iran's electricity grid, and when completed, Karun-4 will also generate 1,000 MW. There are also many dams on the river's tributaries. Dez Dam, Bakhtiari Dam (under construction) and Khersan-3 Dam (under construction) are among them. Khersan 1, Khersan 2, Zalaki, Liro, Roudbar Lorestan, Bazoft, and others are proposed. The dams on the Karun have had a significant effect on the sediment transport and the ecology of the river, and have required the relocation of thousands of residents.\n\n\n\n"}

He built upon the political and military base his father had provided him, and created the Kingdom of Jimma. Consequently, Jimma was no longer referred to as \"Jimma Kaka\" in common parlance, but as Jimma Abba Jifar.\n\nHerbert S. Lewis credits Abba Jifar with having initiated \"many administrative and political innovations\", despite the lack of specific historical evidence. According to oral tradition, Abba Jifar claimed the right to the extensive areas of the newly conquered land as well as virgin or unused land, which he both kept for himself and used to reward his family, followers and favorites. He reportedly constructed at least five palaces in different parts of Jimma.\n\nThe historian Mordechai Abir notes that between the years 1839 and 1841 of his reign, Abba Jifar fought with Abba Bagido the King of Limmu-Ennarea over the district of Badi-Folla. The area was important for control of the caravan route between the Kingdom of Kaffa on the one hand, and the provinces of Gojjam and Shewa on the other. While the two Kings negotiated a peace in 1841, and sealed the treaty with the marriage of Abba Jifar's daughter to Abba Bagido's son Abba Dula, the Jimma King eventually conquered Badi-Folla (1847) and secured control over this important caravan route.\n\nAbba Jifar was also the first king of Jimma to embrace Islam, owing his conversion in 1830 to Abdul Hakim, a trader from Gondar. Lewis notes that as of 1960, Abdul Hakim's tomb in Jiren was still a venerated site.\n"}

Construction began in September 1902, and the initial segment was completed on July 29, 1904. From 1904 to 1963, the seawall was extended from to over .\n\nReporting in the aftermath of the 1983 Hurricane Alicia, the Corps of Engineers estimated that $100 million in damage was avoided because of the seawall. On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike's storm surge and large waves over-topped the seawall. As a result, a commission was established by the Texas governor to investigate preparing for and mitigating future disasters.\n\nA proposal has been put forth to build an \"Ike Dike\", a massive levee system that would protect the Galveston Bay and the important industrial facilities that line the coast and the Houston Ship Channel from a future, potentially more destructive storm. The proposal has gained widespread support from a variety of business interests. it is only at the conceptual stage. Further proposals for a layered network of smaller, local levees and natural protections have been put forward by the SSPEED Center at Rice University and the University of Houston. These proposals include a surge gate at the mouth of the Houston Ship Channel connecting adjacent high ground near the Hartman Bridge and hard protections for the west shore of Galveston Bay and around the densely developed east end of Galveston Island. Also included is the proposed lower coastal Lone Star Coastal National Recreation Area.\n\nTexas F.M. 3005 is known as Seawall Boulevard where it runs along the seawall. The sidewalk adjacent to Seawall Boulevard on top of the seawall is claimed to be the longest continuous sidewalk in the world at long.\n\nThe seawall is long. It is approximately high and thick at its base. The seawall was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 and designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2001.\n\nMany miles of the seawall are painted with murals. These huge murals are painted by children and depict underwater life.\n\n\n\n"}

He was grandson of Don Juan Miguel Gill, one of the founding fathers of Paraguayan Independence and a member of the Cabildo, who had Celtic blood. He was married to Maria Concepcion Diaz de Bedoya. His paternal ancestor, John Thomas [El inglés] McGill (\"Tomas McGill\") was born in Ireland and migrated to Latin America with his brother. The family shortened the surname to \"Gill\" when dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia decreed that prefixes in foreign names should not be used anymore \n\nIn 1854 he traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina where he pursued secondary education and medical training, which he did not complete. He returned to Paraguay in 1863. When the Paraguayan War was declared against Argentina, he enlisted in the 40th battalion, which comprised young men of high social position. Because of his knowledge of medicine, he was appointed to the military health division and served as medical orderly. Gill was captured in the last days of December 1868 after the Battle of Lomas Valentinas. In mid-January 1869 Gill was among those who returned to Asunción, where the Allies freed him and others on condition that they would not join the army again.\n\nOn January 25, 1869 Gill participated in a meeting convened by Don Serapio Machain to petition Allied occupational forces for establishment of a provisional government. Among those who attended that meeting were Jose Segundo Decoud, Cayo Miltos, Carlos Loizaga, Juan Antonio Jara and Salvador Jovellanos, all of whom would soon assume high governmental posts. Gill was supporter of Brazilian interests and counted on their military support during the political struggles. As such, he was in favor of signing Loizaga – Cotegipe Treaty with Brazil.\n\nIn 1870 - 71 he was Finance Minister and President of the Senate in 1872. Gill was accused of misusing funds, and dismissed by the Senate in March 1872. In response Cirilo Antonio Rivarola dissolved the Congress but instead was himself forced to resign. The removal of Rivarola was organized by Gill in cooperation with Brazilians who wanted to place him in Presidency. However, with the support of General Benigno Ferreira it was Salvador Jovellanos who became the President. Before he could remove Jovellanos, Gill was arrested on the orders of General Ferreira and deported from the country.\n\nJovellanos was forced from power after a rebellion started in 1874 under nationalist General Bernardino Caballero and Candido Barreiro and Gill finally became the President between November 25, 1874 and April 12, 1877. His cousin Jose Higinio Uriarte y Garcia del Barrio served as Vice President and after Gill' s assassination served as President for the remainder of his term. His cabinet comprised Emilio Gill and Adolfo Saguier serving as Secretaries of Finance; Germán Serrano and Jose Urdapilleta, as Secretaries of the Interior; Bernardino Caballero and Benjamin Aceval, as Secretaries of Justice, Culture and Public Education; Patricio Escobar, Secretary of War and the Navy; and Facundo Machaín and Benjamin Aceval, as Secretaries of Foreign Affairs, and for a some time Candido Bareiro as Finance Minister.\n\nDuring his government he introduced paper currency, created the National College in the Capital and significantly increased taxes; Civil Code of Argentina was adapted.\n\nIn order to stabilize the national economy, Gill established the Tobacco Monopoly through the April 22, 1875 law. Government took charge of the tobacco export for five years, prohibiting individuals from exporting or importing tobacco products. The same law was later enforced on soap and salt trade for a period of three years.\n\nGill opposed the 1875 Sosa–Tejedor Treaty which would have accepted Argentinian claims to Chaco. On February 3, 1876, a treaty on boundaries, peace, trade and navigation was finally signed with Argentina. Foreign minister Facundo Machaín negotiated and signed the Machaín-Irigoyen Treaty with Argentine Minister Bernardo de Irigoyen under which Paraguay officially ceded Misiones Province, the southern part of the Paraná River and part of Gran Chaco territory, while keeping the most of Gran Chaco. It also made possible the removal of Allied occupation forces from Paraguay by July 3, 1876.\n\nGill's government, like that of his predecessors, was not spared revolutionary movements. A revolt broke out in Caacupé in December 1875 led by General Serrano, his former Minister of Interior. The insurrection was supported by Brazilian forces and quelled after the death of Serrano and other rebels.\n\nInternal political instability led to a plot by Juan Silvano Godoi to assassinate Gill. On April 12, 1877 at about 10 in the morning Gill was travelling in the company of his two \"edecanes\" (high-ranking officers), down the Villarrica street (currently President Franco str.). While crossing the Independencia Nacional, he was shot by three gunmen and died instantly. Among assassins were Nicanor Silvano Godoi (brother of Juan Silvano Godoi) and two others - Molas and Goiburu. Later in the day Gill's brother, General Emilio Gill was also killed.\n\nJuan Silvano Godoi escaped to Argentina from which he returned only in 1895 and was appointed director of the National Library of Paraguay. Godoi had planned that his actions would lead to the restoration of President Rivarola to the office. Instead it led to arrest and murder of Facundo Machaín and other suspects.\n\nThe Colombian poet Dr. Prospero Pereira Gamba (1830–1896), who lived in Argentina as an exile, reflected on this tragic moment experienced by the President in his work \"The Spectre\".\n"}

He was a leading geologist on the program, responsible for studying the geology of the Moon, the selection of landing sites for the Apollo missions, and the training of astronauts in lunar observations and photography. He played a key role in the Apollo 11 moon landing mission, and later Apollo missions. He also came up with the idea of touchable moon rocks at a museum, inspired by his childhood pilgimage to Mecca where he touched the Black Stone (which in Islam is believed to be sent down from the heavens).\n\nHe is married, has four daughters, and six grandchildren. El-Baz is the brother of Osama El-Baz, senior advisor to Egypt's former president Hosni Mubarak.\n\nCurrently, El-Baz is Research Professor and Director of the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. He is Adjunct Professor of Geology at the Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.\n\nHe is also a member of the Board of Trustees of the Geological Society of America Foundation, Boulder, Colorado, a member of the Board of Directors of CRDF Global, and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, Washington, DC.\n\nHe was born on January 2, 1938 in Zagazig, Sharqia Governorate. His family is originally from the Nile Delta village of Touqh el Aklaam, El Senbellawein Markaz, Dakahlia Governorate.\n\nIn 1958, at the age of 20, he received a Bachelor of Science in chemistry and geology from Ain Shams University.\n\nIn 1961, he received a Master of Science in geology from the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy (now Missouri University of Science and Technology).\n\nIn 1964,at the age of 26, he received a Doctor of Philosophy in geology from the Missouri University of Science and Technology after conducting research from 1962 to 1963 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nIn 1978, El-Baz was appointed Science Adviser to President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. He was charged with the selection of regions for land reclamation in the desert without detrimental effects on the environment. For his distinguished service, President Sadat awarded him Egypt's Order of Merit - First Class.\n\nEl-Baz taught Geology at Assiut University, Egypt (1958–1960) and the Heidelberg University, Germany (1964–1965). He joined the Pan American - U.A.R. Oil Company in 1966, where he participated in the discovery of El-Morgan, the first offshore oil field in the Gulf of Suez.\n\nThe key scientist who helped NASA plan and identify the Moon landing location for Apollo 11 historic moon landing in 1969, El-Baz is currently a leading expert in the study of deserts and how to find and sustain water in such environments in the Arab world.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1972, El-Baz participated in the Apollo Program as Supervisor of Lunar Science Planning at Bellcomm Inc., a division of AT&T that conducted systems analysis for NASA. During these six years, he was Secretary of the Landing Site Selection Committee for the Apollo lunar landing missions, Principal Investigator of Visual Observations and Photography, and Chairman of the Astronaut Training Group. In addition to being the scientist who played a key role in helping NASA decide on the ideal moon landing site for the Apollo 11 mission in 1969, El-Baz also served on the Apollo 15 rover mission in 1971. Throughout his time in the Apollo program, El-Baz joined NASA officials in briefing members of the press on the results of the lunar missions. His ability to simplify scientific jargon made his remarks on the program's scientific accomplishments often quoted by the media.\n\nSoon after beginning with the Apollo Program, he was put to work poring over mountains of detailed photographs of the moon's surface—a crucial step in selecting the most ideal and precise landing location based on lunar terrain, climate variations, and other factors. He also performed the same role for the famous Apollo 15 rover mission, and trained Apollo astronauts in the important skills of visual observation and space photography, in addition to instructing crew members on which rocks to collect and how to collect lunar soil. So pivotal was he to Apollo that in Tom Hanks' HBO TV-series, \"From the Earth to the Moon\", El-Baz's role as an Apollo scientist and astronaut trainer was featured in a segment entitled, \"The Brain of Farouk El-Baz,\" and a shuttle craft named \"El-Baz\" soared through the popular TV-series \"\".\n\nHis outstanding teaching abilities were confirmed by the Apollo astronauts. While orbiting the Moon for the first time during Apollo 15, Command Module Pilot Alfred Worden said, \"After the King's [Farouk's nickname] training, I feel like I've been here before.\"\n\nAfter the Apollo Program ended in 1972, El-Baz joined the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC to establish and direct the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies at the National Air and Space Museum. At the same time, he was elected as a member of the Lunar Nomenclature Task Group of the International Astronomical Union. In this capacity, he continues to participate in naming features of the Moon as revealed by lunar photographic missions.\n\nIn 1973, NASA selected him as principal investigator of the Earth Observations and Photography Experiment on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), the first joint American-Soviet space mission in July 1975. Emphasis was placed on photographing arid environments, particularly the Great Sahara of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, in addition to other features of the Earth and its oceans.\n\nEmphasizing the study of the origin and evolution of arid landscapes, he collected field data during visits to every major desert in the world. One of his significant journeys took place soon after the United States and China had normalized relations in 1979, when he coordinated the first visit by American scientists to the deserts of northwestern China. The six-week journey was chronicled in \"National Geographic\" and \"Explorers Journal\". His research on the origin and evolution of the desert resulted in his election as Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\n\nFrom 1982 until he joined Boston University in 1986, he was vice president of Itek Optical Systems of Lexington, Massachusetts. During these years he supervised the utilization of the Space Shuttle's \"Large Format Camera\" photographs.\n\nEl-Baz was elected Fellow of the Geological Society of America, The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), and of the National Academy of Engineering (USA). In 1999, the Geological Society of America Foundation (GSAF) established the Farouk El-Baz Award for Desert Research, to annually reward excellence in arid land studies. In 2007 the GSAF also established the Farouk El-Baz Student Research Award to encourage desert research.\n\nIn April 2011, he joined the liberal Free Egyptians Party, founded by the telecommunications tycoon Naguib Sawiris.\n\nDuring the past 20 years in his research at Boston University, El-Baz has utilized satellite images to better understand the origin and evolution of desert landforms. He is credited with providing evidence that the desert is not man-made, but the result of major climatic variations. His research uncovered numerous sand-buried rivers and streams in the Sahara based on the interpretation of radar images.\n\nThese former water courses lead into depressions in the terrain, which he theorized must contain groundwater. His analysis of these data resulted in the location of groundwater in the arid terrains of Egypt, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), and perhaps Darfur in Sudan (unless it dried up).\n\nEl-Baz piqued the interest of Biblical scholars around the world with his announcement of paleo-drainage from Arabian Peninsula into the Persian Gulf. The idea that a river once flowed across the deserts of Arabia, and somehow connected with the Tigris and/or Euphrates Rivers, draws its evidence from satellite datasets, especially from the radar images taken during the 1994 mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavour. El-Baz studied the images, and noticed that traces of a defunct river that crossed northern Arabia from west to east were visible beneath the sands, thanks to the ground-penetrating capabilities of the radar technologies.\n\nHe called it the Kuwait River, which is more popularly known as Wadi Al-Batin, an extension of Wadi Al-Rummah. The Wadi Al-Batin river system would have been responsible for deposition of the Dibdiba Formation (similar to an alluvial fan deposit, both morphologically and sedimentologically). This river system may have been active 2500–3000 BC.\n\nIn a National Geographic documentary film in 2002, El-Baz proposed a new source for the shape of The Pyramids at Giza. El-Baz believes that the ancient Egyptians chose to bury their dead in pyramid shaped structures because they knew from an earlier nomadic life that monumental pyramidal landforms, which abound in the Western Desert of Egypt, evade erosion.\n\n\n"}

A strong ally of General Bernardino Caballero, he was elected President in 1878 with Caballero's help and died from a stroke after two years in office.\n\nSon of Montiel and Luis Bareiro Felipa Mayor Dolores Caballero he was the grandson of the famous Paraguayan founding father of Independence, Pedro Juan Caballero. He went to a school managed by the Argentine teacher Juan Pedro Escalada. Bareiro benefited from the opening to the world which was initiated by the regime of Carlos Antonio López, with a group of other Paraguayan students on June 2, 1858 he sailed to Europe, where in London he finished his studies. He returned home in the middle of December 1863 and received a bonus of 200 pesos. In May 1865 he was awarded with the National Order of Merit.\n\nThe Uruguayan writer Jose Carranza Sienra, who met him at the start of the Paraguayan War, said of Bareiro:\nOn March 21, 1864 government appointed Cándido Bareiro as chargé d'affaires in the Paraguayan Embassy in London and Paris. He was relieved from his post in October 1867 due to inability to organize critically needed armament shipments to Paraguay. By the time he managed to return to Asuncion in February 1869, the city was already occupied by the Allied armies.\n\nAround him quickly gathered the remaining Lopez loyalists who on March 31, 1869 founded the \"Republican Union Club\" which in early 1870 become the \"Club del Pueblo\" and after February 17, 1878 \"Club Libertad\" and who published their newspaper \"La Voz del Pueblo\".\n\nBareiro faction was also known as \"lopiztas\" because of their loyalty to the memory of President Lopez and it was opposed to the Decoud faction who had established their rival \"Club del Pueblo\" (after March 23, 1870 the \"Gran Club del Pueblo\"). Both of these factions were crucial for the establishment of the Colorado Party in 1887.\n\nTogether with Bernardino Caballero he was one of the organizers of the revolt against the Presidency of Salvador Jovellanos. Despite this, after the removal of Benigno Ferreira in February 1874 he was appointed a Foreign minister by Jovellanos. In this capacity he went to London where he tried to negotiate the war loan payment crisis. He served as Finance minister during the Presidencies of Juan Bautista Gill from April 1874 and Higinio Uriarte from April 1877.\n\nOn November 25, 1878 he finally was elected to the Presidency. His government included:\n\nOn October 1877 he had involved in the murders of imprisoned former President Facundo Machain and others suspected in the assassination of President Gill. In December 1878 he probably was involved in the assassination of former President Rivarola. His political ally Bernardino Caballero was the main organizer of these murders. In June 1879 he suppressed the \"Galileo\" uprising led by the exiled Juan Silvano Godoi.\n\nDuring his rule Paraguay won part of the disputed Gran Chaco territory. This decision was made by international commission led by the US President Rutherford Hayes, in whose honor Presidente Hayes Department was created. After this decision, the Decoud-Quijarro treaty was signed on 15 October 1879 that recognized Bolivia's claims to northern Chaco, but it was never ratified. Argentina handed over territory of the West Villa, currently Villa Hayes where the first ice factory of the country was established.\n\nDespite being almost bankrupt, Government proceeded with the construction of the Palace of Lopez; the Nueva Germania was established, bringing German immigrants to Paraguay; Pedro Juan Aponte was appointed as the first post-war bishop of Paraguay and Argentine Penal Code adopted.\n\nAfter Bareiro's death his vice-president Adolfo Saguier was prevented from assuming Presidency by a bloodless coup led on September 4, 1880 by Bernardino Caballero. Saguier was arrested and the Senate was informed that he has resigned. Caballero then was elected to Presidency.\n\nEarlier in the year 1867 Solano Lopez thought in recommending Bareiro to the mission to travel to the United States to thank the authorities for their thoughtful participation. Unfortunately certain formalities were not entirely fulfilled by Bareiro. The Marshal had ignored a first act of disobedience on his part, but other events that occurred lacked accountability. Lopez ordered to delegate Benitez to Peru and to express the declaration of repudiation by the Paraguayan government towards the treaty of the Triple Alliance. Bareiro did not focus properly on the indication, so he recklessly send a letter, dated December 14, 1866.\n\nIt is said that one of the mistakes of Lopez was to choose Bareiro as Chargé d'affaires of Paraguay in Europe. Some accused him of the defeat of Paraguay in the war, since his mission was to travel to Europe to buy weapons, but these were lost because of his incompetence. All this had no justification whatsoever, so on January 20, 1868, Bareiro was forced to surrender his position. \n\n"}

Since he could not feel helpless, Patricio crossed swimming the Ype-Cuá brook. He crossed the 35 kilometers risking being bitten by snakes and other animals that used to live in the water. He was a true patriot, and in spite of being tired and having a wound in the chest he managed to collect the necessary information.\n\n“The hero of Ype-Cuá”. General Patricio Escobar should have been distinguished with this appropriate denomination and go into history because of his heroic doings and his great courage. But this did not happen. He did not get many recognitions and honors. Just some authors gave him enough credit and tell about his heroic deeds.\n\n"}

The Legacy Shuttle can seat 19 to 37 in airline-style seats but without the range.\n\nThe first flight was made in June 2000, with the prototype of the ERJ-135 (PT-ZJA). This same aircraft was once the prototype of the first ERJ-145. New winglets and new wing-to-fuselage fairing was added, but no additional fuel tanks were available. The new fuselage fuel tanks were ready for the second prototype (PT-XJO), along with engine and avionics, that flew only in March 31st 2001. It was the second Embraer model to feature winglets, as the first were installed on the EMB-145SA military model.

It has nearly the opposite design progression as the rival Canadair Challenger. The Legacy 600 was derived from the established ERJ family of regional jets, while the Canadair Regional Jet was developed by Bombardier from the Challenger business jet. Both lines of aircraft are competitors.

{"id": "2242595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242595", "title": "Leon Kamin", "text": "Leon Kamin\n\nLeon J. Kamin (December 29, 1927 – December 22, 2017) was an American psychologist known for his contributions to learning theory and his critique of estimates of the heritability of IQ. He studied under Richard Solomon at Harvard and contributed several important ideas about conditioning, including the \"blocking effect\".\n\nLeon Kamin was born into a Jewish family in Taunton, Massachusetts; his father was a rabbi. Kamin studied psychology at Harvard. While a Harvard undergraduate, he was member of the Communist Party, but dropped out of the party by 1950. Later, while a graduate student, Kamin was subpoenaed by the McCarthy Committee, where he refused to name others who had been Communists. As a result, Kamin was convicted of contempt of the Senate during the McCarthy era and had to find employment in Canada, where he chaired the Psychology Department at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada (1957–58). In 1968 he returned to the U.S. and chaired Princeton University's Department of Psychology and later the Psychology Department at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nKamin's most well-known contribution to learning theory was his discovery and analysis of the \"blocking effect\" (1969). He showed that conditioning an animal to associate a salient conditioned stimulus (CSb), such as a bright light, with a salient unconditioned stimulus (US), like a shock, is \"blocked\" when CSb is presented simultaneously with another conditioned stimulus (CSa) that was already conditioned to the US. (Kamin used rats in most of his research, but the effect has been found in many animals). The blocking effect is one of the hallmark effects in the study of associative learning in animals, including humans. However, subsequent research suggests it is not as robust as previously thought.\n\nIn March 1972 an invitation from the Princeton Psychology Department (which Kamin chaired at the time) to Richard Herrnstein (who had a few months earlier published a contentious article about race, gender, class, and intelligence) sparked a major controversy and threats of protest. Herrnstein canceled his visit, saying that \"It would be enough for me not to come if they had placards on the wall.\" Kamin defended the invitation to Herrnstein, opposed the protests, and organized a meeting to discuss the controversy. The resulting debates spurred Kamin to start investigating the work on heritability of intelligence of Cyril Burt, work that Herrnstein was citing to support his views. Kamin concluded that Burt had falsified his data; in 1974 he published his analysis in the book \"The Science and Politics of IQ\".\n\nKamin co-authored the controversial book \"Not in Our Genes\" (1984) with geneticist Richard Lewontin and neurobiologist Steven Rose. This book criticized sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. Kamin was known in some circles for his speculation that the heritability of IQ could be \"zero\". (Mackintosh, 1998) In 1983, he was named a Guggenheim Fellow in psychology.\n\nHe was honorary professor of psychology at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.\n\n\n\n"}

On January 9, 1902, a revolutionary committee that was formed by the generals Caballero and Escobar, and Colonel Drain concluded the wishes of overthrowing Aceval, forced him to resign, and in the parliamentary precinct exploded an incident that resulted in the death of Senator Facundo Insfrán and wound several congressmen.

It is above sea level.\n\n1919 - 1945 the complex was in Poland and was considered one of the most beautiful castles in the \"Kresy\" region.\n\nThe estate was owned by the Radziwiłł magnate family from 1533, when it was awarded to Mikołaj Radziwiłł and his brother Jan Radziwiłł after the extinction of the Kiszka family. Since the Radziwiłłs were one of the most important and wealthy clans of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, it was there that the Lithuanian Archive was moved in 1551. In 1586 the estate was turned into an \"ordynacja\".\n\nAfter the Union of Lublin the castle became one of the most important residences in the central part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nIn 1582 Mikołaj Krzysztof \"Sierotka\" Radziwiłł, the Marshal of Lithuania, Voivode of Trakai–Vilnius and castellan of Šiauliai, started the construction of an imposing square three-storey \"château\". Although the works were based on a pre-existing structure of a medieval castle, the former fortifications were entirely turned into a renaissance-baroque house. Construction was completed by 1604, and they added several galleries half a century later. The château's corners were fortified with four octagonal towers.\n\nIn 1706, during the Great Northern War, Charles XII's army sacked the castle and destroyed its fortifications. Several decades later, the Radziwiłłs invited some German and Italian architects to substantially renovate and enlarge the castle. Antoni Zaleski decorated its yellow facades with baroque stucco work. The 16th-century castle gates were also reconstructed, and the two-storey gatehouse tower was crowned with a helm. It was at this time that the three separate buildings surrounding the central courtyard were joined into a single structure.\n\nThe most important structure in Nieśwież is the Corpus Christi Church (1587 to 1603), connected with the castle by a dam over a ditch and containing coffins of 72 members of the Radziwiłł family, each interred in a simple coffin made of birch and marked with Trąby coat of arms. Designed by the Italian architect Gian Maria Bernardoni (1541 to 1605), the church is considered the first Jesuit temple patterned after Il Gesù in Rome, the first domed basilica with Baroque facade in the world and the first baroque piece of architecture in Eastern Europe. \nApart from elaborate princely sepulchres, its interior features some late baroque frescoes from 1760s and the Holy Cross altar, executed by Venetian sculptors in 1583. \n\nIn 1772, following the third and last partition of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the castle was seized by Russian forces and the Radziwiłł family was expelled. Soon afterwards the Lithuanian Archive was transferred to Saint Petersburg (where it still remains today), while the majority of works of art gathered in the palace were distributed among various Russian and Polish nobles in support of Catherine the Great. Abandoned both by the original owners and by the Russian army, the palace gradually fell into disrepair. However, it was restored by the Radziwiłłs and between 1881 and 1886 the castle's interiors were renovated by Prince Antoni Radziwiłł and his French wife, Marie de Castellane. They also designed a landscape park in English style. With an area of more than one square kilometre, the park is one of the biggest such facilities in Europe.\n\nAfter the Polish–Bolshevik War of 1920 the surrounding area and the castle complex became part of the newly established Second Polish Republic.\n\nDuring the invasion of Poland in 1939, the Radziwiłł family was expelled from the castle by the Red Army. In Soviet times, the castle was used a sanatorium, while the park gradually fell into neglect. \n\nIn 1994, the castle complex was designated the national historical and cultural reserve. In 2005 the castle complex was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe ongoing reconstruction has drawn sharp criticism for its \"unjustified reconstruction\" of several long-demolished structures, notably a bell-tower. In 2002, the upper storey of the residence was destroyed by fire. Six years later, the Belarus edition of the \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" reported that a substantial section of the castle, dating from the 18th century, had been entirely demolished on account of \"rotten brick\" (see photo).\n\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Liberal Party.\n\nThe general and doctor Benigno Ferrerira was one of the main protagonists in the postwar period of' ‘70 and one of the most respected political leaders of his era.\n\nBorn in Tapuá Grande (nowadays Limpio), January 13, 1846. Son of María Concepción Ferreira and Angel Joaquín Mora Coene. His sisters were: Susana (married to Silvestre Aveiro) and Mercedes\n(married to Federico Guillermo Baez, former president of the Constitutional Convention of 1870).\n\nBorn January 13, 1846 in Mora Cué, today Jurisdiction of Limpio, the former Tapuá. Son of Joaquin Angel Mora Coene and María Concepción Ferreira. This marriage could not be legalized because of the refusal of the dictator Francia, at the end of his life, to grant permission. Despite being a recognized son, Benigno chose to take the mother's maiden name.\n\nThe entry into Colegio de San Carlos of Asunción was prevented to young Benigno, son of an opponent, by order of Don Carlos Antonio López, president of the republic.\n\nHistorian Manuel Pesoa mentions that his baptism godfather was the Argentine consul general Jose Tomas Ramirez, representing general Justo José de Urquiza, who favored his godson with a scholarship at the College of Concepción Uruguay in the province of Entre Ríos, Argentina. There, Benigno Ferreira engaged relationship with other young Argentines and Paraguayans.\n\nHe later moved to Buenos Aires to begin his studies of Law at the University. His career was interrupted by the outbreak of war against Paraguay 1865.\n\nThe Paraguayan colony in Buenos Aires was formed by families who had left their homeland for political reasons. In this midst of liberal ideas they criticized the authoritarianism of the Lopez and their cruel police procedures. A group of Paraguayan students began organizing a united front to fight the regime of Asuncion.\n\nThey published articles in the press in Buenos Aires and even signed manifestos. Ferreira was a full-fledged liberal. His ideology was in line with that of other young people who encouraged principles of liberty.\n\nAll this activity was closely followed by Lopez's agents, who took harsh reprisals against Benigno's mother \"due to the criminal conduct of his son.\" Mrs. Concepcion was seized and tortured to declare against her missing son.\n\nHaving noticed the pain in which his mother was put in, he consolidated the intention to take a position that in the eyes of some Paraguayans was considered vile. Arturo Bray noted that Ferreira was a man of laws, but that the imperative of the facts made him assume positions such as enrolling in the ranks of the army. At age 19 he joined the Paraguayan Legion.\n\nBy knowing the secret Treaty of the Triple Alliance, Benigno Ferreira would appear in person before General Urquiza to convey the following: \"We have been deceived. The treaty of alliance is a disgrace to the signatory governments, an insult to my homeland and a mockery to civilization.\" Ferreira resigned and returned to Buenos Aires to devote himself to journalism in the newspaper \"La Republica\", in whose columns continued to lambaste the Alliance.\n\nSome modern historians argue that \"the right attitude against the issue of legionnaires is to try to get in place of the exiles, observing his actions and his deeds in the light of the political principles and social force in his time.\"\n\nAfter the occupation of Asuncion, Benigno Ferreira was appointed captain of the port of the capital. In September 1869 he joined the Freemasons.\n\nThe following month he was among the drafters of the newspaper \"La Regeneración\".\n\nIn 1870, he was elected member of the committee of “The Great People's Club” led by Facundo Machaín and a few days later assumed command of a battalion of National Guard with the rank of Sergeant Major.\n\nFigure from an early age in national politics he became minister of War and Navy in 1871 during the government of Cirilo Antonio Rivarola. In the troubled atmosphere of the reorganization of the Public State, he took over a bench in the Lower House and later served as minister of Justice.\n\nHe dealt with three armed revolts in the years ‘73 and ‘74. As a result of latter, he was forced to endure a long exile (1874–1895), a period in which obtained a doctorate in law in Buenos Aires.\n\nHe found upon his return a divided Liberal Party, this time between civic and radicals.\n\nHe actively participated in the civil war in 1904 when the Pilcomayo Pact was signed. When the new government was installed, he went back to the position of minister of War and Navy and later became a member of the Superior Court.\n\nOn November 25, 1906, he took the first magistracy, being his vice president Don Emiliano González Navero.\n\nHis Cabinet was composed of Don Emiliano González Navero as the vice-president and Adolfo R. Soler as Finance Minister. Manuel Brítez in the Ministry of Interior, Carlos L. Isasi in the Ministry of Justice, Guillermo de los Rios as Minister for Religious Affairs and Public Instruction, Manuel J. Duarte as Minister of War and Navy and Cecilio Báez as Chancellor.\n\nThe civic were defeated and the general chairman Benigno Ferreira dismissed.\n\nHis government established new telegraph lines, the Normal Teachers School moved to Villarica and the number of primary schools increased. He also closed military courses and built barracks in the towns of the countryside as well as a building for the capital customs.\n\nOn the other hand, he settled a long conflict with the large railroad company, the Bank of the Republic was founded, the treaty Soler-Pinilla with Bolivia, was signed, and warlike equipments were acquired from Europe.\n\nHe marched into exile once again. He found death in Buenos Aires in 1920. The coffin was transferred directly to the Government Palace in Asuncion for the wake.\n\n\n"}

Henry Award.\n\nBorn and raised in Todd County, Kentucky at her family's plantation home known as \"Woodstock,\" Caroline Gordon received a high level of education at her father's Clarksville Classical School for Boys in neighboring Montgomery County, Tennessee. By 1916 she had graduated from West Virginia's Bethany College and obtained a job as a writer of society news for the \"Chattanooga Reporter\" newspaper. After eight years, she left Chattanooga and returned home, where, at the age of twenty-nine, she met Allen Tate, a free-spirited \"bohemian\" poet, commentator and essayist, four years her junior. They immediately embarked on a passionate love affair which culminated in a pregnancy and a May 15, 1925 wedding. Their daughter Nancy was born in September.\n\nOver the next twenty years, Caroline Gordon (who retained her maiden name) and Allen Tate lived in a house in Clarksville, Tennessee that they bought with the generous assistance of Tate's brother Ben. It was the first of their houses named for Ben Tate: \"BenFolly\", and later, in Princeton they owned a house on Nassau Street called BenBrackets. Their guests at BenFolly included some of the best-known writers of their time, including Robert Lowell, who famously camped on their lawn in a tent one summer, absorbing everything he could from his mentor, Allen Tate, while enjoying the southern cooking and constant social life provided by Caroline Gordon. Other visitors were F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, T. S. Eliot, Robert Penn Warren, and Ford Madox Ford, the author whom Gordon considered her mentor. Ford counseled and prodded her into completing her first novel \"Penhally\", published in 1931. Gordon received both of her awards, the Guggenheim and the O. Henry, during this early period. The O. Henry was a unique second-place prize awarded for her 1934 short story \"Old Red\", published in \"Scribner's Magazine\". There were seventeen third-place recipients that year, including William Saroyan, Pearl Buck, Erskine Caldwell, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, and Thomas Wolfe.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1972, Gordon published nine additional novels, five of which were written during the late 1930s and World War II.\n\nGordon's early fiction was influenced by her association with the Southern Agrarians. Paul V. Murphy writes that she \"exhibited a southern nostalgia as strong as any member of the group, including Davidson, the most unreconstructed of the Agrarians\".\n\nCaroline Gordon's marriage to Allen Tate ended in divorce in 1945, followed by a 1946 remarriage and an ultimate divorce in 1959. They continued to correspond, however, and remained friends. On November 24, 1947, during another difficult period in her marriage, Gordon converted to Catholicism. She became a friend and mentor to the Southern novelist Walker Percy, another convert to Catholicism, aiding him in his literary efforts. Caroline Gordon was also a close friend of the Georgia author, Brainard Cheney, and his wife, Frances (Fanny) Neel Cheney. Cheney, author of four novels based in south Georgia, considered Caroline to be his \"literary mentor.\" She taught him to write literature as compared to journalism, his previous occupation being that of a crime reporter. Influenced by Gordon and her husband, Allen Tate, they converted to Catholicism. She also introduced them to Flannery O'Connor, with whom they became close friends.\n\nShe continued to write until crippled by a March 1, 1981, stroke in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, where she lived in her later years. She died six weeks later, following surgery, at the age of 85.\n\n"}

Determination of the shock sensitivity of a material intended for practical use is one important aspect of safety testing of explosives. A variety of tests and indices are in use, of which one of the more common is the Rotter Impact Test with results expressed as FoI (Figure of Insensitivity.) At least four other impact tests are in common use, while various \"gap tests\" are used to measure sensitivity to blast shock. Julius-Peters KG is a notable German company which manufactures testing apparatus for these tests.\n\nA few materials such as nitrogen triiodide cannot be touched at all without detonating, and so are of purely academic interest. Some other compounds with a high sensitivity to shock, such as nitroglycerin and acetone peroxide, may detonate from a firm jolt and so cannot be legally transported in pure form. Acetone peroxide is often used by amateurs and terrorists as a means to detonate other explosives as well as acting as the main blasting agent, often resulting in injuries or death to those who underestimate its sensitivity. A number of methods are known to desensitize nitroglycerine so that it can be transported for medical uses, and it is also incorporated into other less sensitive explosives, such as dynamites and gelignites.\n\nMany practical commercial materials of intermediate sensitivity, such as gelignites and water gel explosives, can be safely handled as they will not explode from casual shocks such as being dropped or lightly knocked by a tool. However, they may explode if struck forcefully by a metal tool, and would certainly explode in the barrel if they were used in an artillery shell. Reliable initiation of such materials requires the small explosion of a detonator.\n\nStill less sensitive materials such as blasting agents like ANFO, are so insensitive that the impulse from the detonator must be amplified by an explosive booster charge to secure reliable detonation. Some polymer bonded explosives — especially those based on TATB — are designed for use in insensitive munitions, which are unlikely to detonate even if struck by another explosive weapon.\n"}

{"id": "2242648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242648", "title": "Berkeley Student Cooperative", "text": "Berkeley Student Cooperative\n\nThe Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC) (formerly known as University Students' Cooperative Association or the USCA) is a student housing cooperative serving primarily UC Berkeley students, but open to any full-time post-secondary student. The BSC houses and/or feeds over 1,300 students in 17 houses and three apartment buildings. Food is provided to residents of the 17 houses, which also offer boarding meal plans to non-residents. Residents of the houses are expected to perform work (typically five hours per week) as part of their rental agreement, which makes the rent lower. The BSC is led by a board of directors which is primarily composed of and elected by the student members.\nThe University of California Students' Cooperative Association (UCSCA) was founded in 1933 to meet the need for affordable student housing during the Great Depression. Berkeley YMCA director Harry Lees Kingman inspired 14 students to start the first housing cooperative in Berkeley, doing workshifts in exchange for lower rent. In the fall of 1933 the students leased Barrington Hall which housed 48 students. Sherman Hall, Sheridan Hall, and Euclid Hall all opened during this era, as well as Stebbins Hall, the first women's co-op.\n\nAfter World War II the UCSCA purchased Ridge House and Cloyne Court Hotel to meet the demand from the increase in the student population caused by the GI Bill. Due to changes in state law, the organization changed its name to the University Students' Cooperative Association (USCA). In the 1960s, the co-op opened one of the first co-ed student housing projects in the nation, Ridge Project, later renamed Casa Zimbabwe in the 1980s. The 1960s and 1970s saw a decline in the popularity of the Greek System in Berkeley, which allowed the USCA to purchase defunct sororities which became Davis House, Andres Castro Arms, and Wolf House.\n\nThe 1970s saw the opening of Lothlorien Hall, a vegetarian theme house, and Kingman Hall, both of which formerly housed New Age communities (Lothlorien was leased to the One World Family commune and Kingman Hall was owned by the Berkeley Living Love Center). This decade also saw the construction and opening of the Rochdale Village Apartments, one of BSC's three apartment facilities. The others are Fenwick Weaver's Village and the Northside Apartments. BSC also owns two graduate and re-entry student houses, The Convent and Hillegass/Parker House, formerly Le Chateau.\n\nIn 1989, the members of the USCA voted to close Barrington Hall, its largest co-op, in reaction to complaints from neighbors and problems with the City. The following decade also saw the opening of two new theme houses: the African American Theme House, opened in response to the University's closing of all of its theme houses; and, in 1999, Oscar Wilde House. Oscar Wilde House is a former fraternity house, which the USCA was able to buy due to the continuing decline in the popularity of the Greek system in Berkeley.\n\nIn 2007, to make itself easier to find online, and to reflect a membership that now also includes community college students, the organization changed its name to the Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC).\n\nDuring the 1980s, the permanent staff of the BSC was organized into a collective bargaining unit known as the Employee Association. The last contract expired on December 31, 2012. After tense negotiations, the board of directors approved a new contract in May 2013.\n\nThe BSC is governed by a board of directors with 28 voting members. Each of the 17 houses and 3 apartment complexes elects a representative to a 12-month term approximately corresponding the UC Berkeley academic year. Larger houses may have up to 4 representatives. The BSC Alumni Association and Employees Association also each have one representative. At the recommendation of the President, the Board may also seat 1-2 members of the BSC Alumni Association and/or the UC Berkeley faculty as additional Board members. Most decisions are made by majority vote.\n\nThe President and Vice presidents, who run committees that screen proposals for the Board, are student members elected by the board to 1-year terms. The BSC also has a permanent staff of approximately 20, including maintenance, office, and food warehouse employees. Staff supervises student managers who handle day-to-day management at the houses and apartment complexes. These managers are elected by their individual houses. Each house also holds councils every week or every other week to set house level policies and allocate house level budgets.\n\nThe BSC currently operates 20 houses and apartments (of which it owns 16), housing and/or feeding over 1300 students and ranging from small houses of 17 residents to large houses of over 100 residents. The BSC also owns the former site of Barrington Hall, which it leases to a for-profit landlord.\n\nCasa Zimbabwe, known as \"Ridge Project\" from 1966–1987, now commonly referred to as CZ, is located at 2422 Ridge Road, a block from the North Gate of the University of California, Berkeley campus. The yellow stucco fortress sits on what is referred to as the \"Holy Hill\", the area surrounding a five-way intersection surrounded on all sides by churches and seminaries, such as the Graduate Theological Union. The BSC central office and central kitchen are located within the Casa Zimbabwe building. CZ houses 124 residents.\n\nThe residents of Casa Zimbabwe are affectionately referred to as \"Czars\". Residents of Ridge Project were referred to as \"Projectiles\".\n\nWhile every other BSC house was a pre-existing structure eventually converted into a co-op, CZ was built from scratch with the specific intent of being used as a cooperative living space. The house is divided into three segments. Residents' rooms are located in the east and west wings, both of which are connected in the middle by two stories of wide open common space. This layout is a legacy as the first co-ed co-op, with the east wing for women and the west wing for men. Such a layout seems to encourage social interaction more so than in some other houses. Presently, men and women live in both wings.\n\nFurther evidence of having been built as a student co-op is the strange architecture. While the east wing is three stories tall, the west wing is four stories and is offset downward by half a floor. The stairwells look like their corners were chopped off as an afterthought, and none of the halls are perfectly straight. According to Co-op legends, the architects had originally designed the building to look more normal, like the campus dorms. Since many former dorm-residents move into the co-ops to escape the sterility of dorm life, the architects were asked to re-design the house to look less dorm-like. The steep terrain of the hill contributed to the odd design. The design also provided as many rooms and common areas as possible with sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge or the Berkeley Campus.\n\nWhen CZ opened in 1966, it was known as \"Ridge Project\" since it shares its lot with Ridge House. In 1987, the house residents successfully petitioned to change the house name to its current one. The name \"Casa Zimbabwe\" was first proposed in 1983. At that time, the USCA had a Minority Affairs committee that was looking to increase the number of minorities at Berkeley in general and in the co-ops in particular. The word \"project\" had a negative association with public housing. An additional issue was the frequent confusion between Ridge Project and Ridge House. No satire was intended with the name \"Casa Zimbabwe\". White minority rule had recently ended in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, and many believed that Zimbabwe would become a prosperous western-style democracy. In 2002, the residents petitioned to change the name of the house to Krackistan, but the BSC Central Office rejected the proposal outright.\n\nCasa Zimbabwe closed at the end of 2006 in order to perform major seismic retrofitting work. An elevator was also installed to make the building wheelchair accessible. The house was reopened in Fall 2007.\n\nThe Cloyne Court Hotel, often referred to simply as Cloyne, is located at 2600 Ridge Road at Leroy Avenue on the north side of the University of California, Berkeley campus. Cloyne Court was named after Cloyne, the village in Ireland where George Berkeley was bishop.\n\nCloyne is one of the biggest cooperative houses in the country with 140 residents. Despite its size the house is student-run and student-governed. Since July 2005, a facility manager employed by students lives on the premises to help with day-to-day operations of the house.\n\nCloyne was built in 1904, as a high-class hotel, operated by the Pierce family, who later bought it from the original investors. The building survived the devastating 1923 Berkeley fire. Cloyne Court was sold by the Pierce family in 1946 to the BSC. In 1972, Cloyne Court became a co-ed house. In 1970, BSC was forced to sell the property to the Regents of the University of California, upon the threat of an eminent domain acquisition by the University, in exchange for a low-cost lease, most recently renewed in July 2005.\n\nThe building is one of fifty-six buildings in Berkeley listed in the National Register of Historic Places as well as a City of Berkeley Landmark.\n\nBeginning in Fall 2014 the house became a substance-free and academic themed.\n\nAndres Castro Arms, often referred to as simply Castro, houses 56 residents (known as \"Castrati\", \"Castronauts,\" \"Castruffles,\" \"Castromboli,\" etc.) and is located about two blocks south-east of the University of California, Berkeley. It was originally designed as a mansion by architect Julia Morgan. Its most distinguishing external feature is the three-story red brick staircase leading up to the Warring entrance.\n\nThe house was originally designed in the Mediterranean style by architect Julia Morgan for metallurgist Charles Washington Merrill. The house was built in 1911 at a cost of $21,531 and originally featured an S-shaped driveway running up the steep hill to the house and the interior was elaborately decorated with redwood, pine and oak paneling, similar in many ways to the interior of another Julia Morgan-designed co-op, Davis House, however this was stripped when the house was converted to a sorority.\n\nWith the construction in 1923 by the University of California of Memorial Stadium and the International House in 1929 a few houses to the north, the neighborhood, once home to many exclusive and expensive mansions, turned into more of a student-oriented neighborhood dominated by sorority and fraternity houses.\n\nIn 1939, Merrill sold the home to the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority. The eighty-four chapter sorority was founded in 1898 and the Upsilon Chapter at Cal was established in 1915 and initially located in a house on Euclid Avenue on the northside. The sorority attempted to make the house look more modernist by stripping the interiors of the woodwork and enclosing the front porch in glass. In 1957, the sorority constructed a wing addition to the house at a cost of $71,500.\n\nIn the 1960s, the popularity of the Greek system declined significantly in Berkeley and many sorority and fraternity houses were forced to close for lack of membership. Unable to attract sufficient membership ZTA was forced to close its doors.\n\nThe USCA purchased the building in 1971, and decided to name the house in honor of long-time central kitchen cook Andres Castro, who was seriously ill at the time, but later recovered. The BSC initially opened the house as an all-male house, but after the first year in response to the need for more female housing and an overall trend in favor of co-ed housing, the house became co-ed.\n\nCalifornia State Historic Resources Inventory, compiled by Sara Holmes Boutelle (author of \"Julia Morgan – Architect\") 8/3/78. Her sources include:\n\n\nDavis House is located at 2833 Bancroft Steps, which is a pedestrian pathway between the Alpha Phi sorority and Davis House, behind the International House and near California Memorial Stadium. The house can hold 36 residents and has always been co-ed. Residents of the house are known as \"Davisaurs\". The house has been referred to as \"the retirement home\". This is because the house is mainly occupied by 4th years. As a result, the house is quiet most nights, compared to other coops.\n\nThe building was originally built in 1913 as the Richard Clark house, a single-family mansion, supposedly to house the son of one of the Hearst family's attorneys while he attended school at the University of California. The house was designed by architect Julia Morgan, who also designed two other current BSC houses, Wolf House and Andres Castro Arms. The beautiful interiors are described by Sara Holmes Boutelle in her book \"Julia Morgan: Architect\": \"Morgan gave free play to her love of complexity in the wood-paneled living room, dining room, and library, all of which have fireplaces with elaborate mantels. The living-room mantel is carved of oak, showing acorns, leaves, birds, and squirrels; another has classical details; brackets in the hall and on yet another fireplace, in the library, repeat the Tudor rose.\"\n\nWith the completion of Memorial Stadium in 1923 and the International House in 1929, the neighborhood transferred from one of quiet, expensive mansions into a student-oriented neighborhood dominated by sorority and fraternity houses. At some point during this time, the house became a sorority (Alpha Xi Delta) and several additions were made to the building, including a sleeping porch with a deck above that features an expansive view of San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nWith the 1960s, the popularity of the Greek system in Berkeley saw a steady decline. Many sorority and fraternity houses were forced to close for want of members, including this one.\n\nIn 1969, BSC purchased the building from the sorority for use as a co-op, one of several former Greek houses it acquired during this era. The price was $75,000 (1969 dollars) and another $40,000 or so was spent on interior modifications, including changing the sleeping porch into private rooms. The house opened to residents in January 1970.\n\nDavis House was established for juniors, seniors and graduate students, and was unique for its time in that members prepared all their own meals, including dinners, rather than obtaining them from the BSC's Central Kitchen on Northside. Like all co-ops, each member had a five-hour workshift every week, and for seven of the members, cooking dinner was the shift. They were free to select what would be served. Breakfasts and lunches were prepared individually by the residents, and at holidays such as Thanksgiving sumptuous meals would be created for which all the students wore their finest.\n\nThree marriages resulted from the first 34 charter members.\n\nThe area has seen much change in the past year. California Memorial Stadium has been renovated to its original 1920s condition. The houses surrounding Davis house were retrofitted over the summer of 2012. During this same summer Davis house was repainted. The entire area has been restored to mid century look.\n\nHillegass/Parker House is a student housing cooperative in Berkeley, California. It is part of the BSC coop system.\n\nFrom the 1970s until 2005, Hillegass/Parker (AKA HiP House) was the site of Le Chateau, a large undergraduate co-op for 90 residents. After Barrington Hall closed, Le Chateau became \"the black sheep\" of the BSC system. Housing values rose in the southside neighborhood it occupied, and neighbors organized to file 20 small claims court cases at once against BSC. BSC offered to evict everybody and install new undergraduates if the neighbors would drop the suits, but they refused. BSC decided to meet the neighbors' request to convert the building into a graduate/re-entry co-op, which opened in Fall 2005.\n\nHiP House consists of three large houses, with a large kitchen in the central Main house. Additionally, it has a large backyard which was re-landscaped during the conversion. One of the house's major perks, the swimming pool in the backyard, was cemented over in order to appease neighbors. There is also a large roof deck on top of Main house. Residents of this house are known as \"HiPpos\".\n\nHoyt Hall was purchased by the USCA in 1953. It is located on the Northside of the UC Berkeley campus, on a block which holds four other BSC properties. Hoyt is one of two women-only houses in BSC, and houses 60 women during the school year. During the summer, the house becomes coed.\n\nHere is a description about the house from a Hoytian who lived there for roughly two years (Spring 2012-Summer 2013): \"From hippy to preppy to everything in between, there is no dominant house culture or lifestyle here. Everyone is welcome. We have well-kept couches, an enormous TV, one of the best free piles in the co-op system, two roofs (one complete with a laundry line, the other with a view of the bay), 25-cent laundry, an in-house store with snacks and green books, a study room with cheap printing, an urban garden with herbs and strawberries and poppies, and a popcorn machine (for those of you addicted to nutritional yeast popcorn). We have a semesterly wine and cheese night, silly song and story night, weekly study halls, and fancy, delicious special dinners! But it's the people that make Hoyt. Our community provides love and support for each other and upholds a safe and empowering space. This is not just another place to stay. This is Hoyt. Welcome to our home.\"\n\nKingman Hall is located at 1730 La Loma Avenue on the northeast corner of the University of California, Berkeley campus. Kingman houses 50 residents, known as Toads. It is named after Harry Kingman, the former YMCA director who inspired 14 students to start USCA in 1933. The house was designated a City of Berkeley Landmark in January 1999.\n\nThe house at 1730 La Loma Avenue was designed by the San Francisco architects Drysdale and Thomsen and originally built as a chapter house for the Theta Xi fraternity in 1914 by Barry Building Co. of Oakland. The building survived the devastating 1923 Berkeley Fire, which burned close to 600 buildings north of the Berkeley campus. The Nu chapter of Theta Xi resided there until 1964, when the fraternity was disbanded owing to anti-Greek sentiment on the Berkeley campus.\n\nThe house was almost sold to developers as a site for high-rise apartments, but instead embarked on a more bizarre career. From 1964 to 1969, it was known as Toad Hall and served as a rooming house for male students. In 1969, it was purchased by a Hayward attorney named Harold Mefford, who rented out the house to non-students as well. The house reportedly functioned more as a commune than a rooming house and housed at most 50% students.\n\nOne of the residents was Joy, Country Joe McDonald's personal secretary, who lived in a basement room. Author/Merry Prankster Ken Kesey (not to be confused with author/future owner Ken Keyes, Jr.) and musician David Crosby used to buy their drugs from a Toad Hall dealer, and their cars were often seen parked in front of the house.\n\nIn 1973, Mefford sold the building for $127,000, to Ken Keyes, Jr., author of \"Living Love – a Way to Higher Consciousness\" and the building became the Berkeley Living Love Center. \"The Living Love Way\" was disseminated via broadcasts on KQED-FM every Saturday evening. A 52-hour morning-noon-and-night group workshop, designed by Keyes, offered the opportunity for a breakthrough toward higher consciousness. The LLC claimed tax exemption as a religious organization and operated on a non-profit basis.\n\nOn November 22, 1976, the center approached the city of Berkeley with an offer to donate the property for park use if it could be determined that it was located on the Hayward Fault line. They did this because they felt it would be a violation of the \"Law of Higher Consciousness\" to simply sell the property to someone else.\n\nFor whatever reason, this fell through and the building was sold in 1977 to BSC for $300,000. The Living Love Center relocated to a farm-university in St. Mary, Kentucky. The house was renamed Kingman Hall, after Harry L. Kingman, director of the local University YMCA who encouraged the BSC founders to start a housing cooperative in 1933.\n\nIn 1998–1999, in response to the residents' application to construct a deck on the roof of the building, the neighbors sought landmark designation for the building, previously considered eligible, in an attempt to block the group's permit application. Although the house was designated a landmark and the Landmarks Preservation Commission denied the application for a permit to build a roof deck, the group's appeal to the Berkeley City Council was successful, the permit was issued with use restrictions, and the deck built. Kingman residents are not allowed to use the deck after 9 pm.\n\n\n\nLothlorien, known by residents as \"Loth\", is the BSC's vegetarian theme house. It houses 57 residents. As such, all house-bought food is vegetarian and house bylaws prohibit the preparation, storage, or consumption of meat in common space. Because of this, many residents of Lothlorien are vegetarians and vegans, but diet is not a condition of residence and meat-eating members are quite common. Aside from being a vegetarian house, Lothlorien tries to buy as much locally sourced and organic foods as possible. Elves buying food for the house frequent the Downtown Berkeley Farmers' Market. In 2010, Lothlorien was the first co-op house to install photovoltaic solar panels.\n\nLothlorien consists of two adjacent houses: North House at 2405 Prospect Street, and South House at 2415 Prospect Street. The two houses surround a common courtyard area and share a communal kitchen and dining room in the South House. The wall in the courtyard is an open mural space on which any \"elf\", as the residents are known, can paint, draw, carve, paste, etc. following environmental guidelines as set by house policy.\n\nLothlorien's North House (2405 Prospect) originally stood in the middle of the Channing circle, where Channing Way meets Piedmont Avenue. It was a mansion owned by the Maxwell family, known in the area as Maxwell House. Near the turn of the 20th century, the family decided they wanted a better view, put the house on logs and rolled it up the hill to its present location next to South House. South House was a sorority during the 1920s. Both houses were owned by Victor Constantine who in 1969 leased them to the One World Family, a utopian commune led by Allen Michael who believed in extraterrestrial guidance for the transformation of humanity, and operated a vegetarian restaurant on Telegraph Avenue. The BSC bought the building in 1975.\n\n\nLothlorien is currently the only BSC house to make decisions by consensus, rather than by vote. The house Council meets weekly, and usually consists of member reports, coordinator reports and motions. A motion is brought to Council by members and non-members alike, and may range in topic from asking to stay as a guest to using money from the maintenance budget to buy materials to paint a mural. A motion passes when all those present at council come to consensus on the issue. If an elf feels they cannot agree with the motion, they may \"major object\" or \"minor object\" to it (for a motion to fail, a minimum one is needed of the former objection and 3 of the latter).\n\nAs at other houses, elected residents serve as coordinators: House Coordinator, Kitchen Coordinator, Maintenance Coordinator, Workshift Coordinator, Waste Reduction Coordinator, Garden Coordinator, Social Coordinator, Health Worker, Policy Coordinator, Network Manager (Internet), and Finance Elf. Lothlorien is the only house without a president—rather, Lothlorien has a \"Policy Coordinator\", who is responsible for keeping record of the house's motion history.\n\n\nThe Oscar Wilde House, often referred to simply as Wilde House, is located on Warring Street, in the heart of UC Berkeley's fraternity row, and was a former fraternity house. Its residents have chosen the nickname, \"wildebeests\". Opened in 1999, Wilde House was one of the first gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender-themed (LGBT) student housing cooperative in the United States. It houses 38 residents. It is named after Oscar Wilde.\n\nWilde house was a major source of inspiration for Ant Hill Cooperative in upstate New York.\n\nRidge House is a converted mansion, now affiliated with the Berkeley Student cooperative. The House is co-ed and houses 38 university students (also known as 'Scorpions'). Located at 2420 Ridge Road, one block North of the UC Berkeley Campus, it is bordered to the west by the library of the Graduate Theological Union and greater \"God Quad,\" as the neighborhood is often irreverently called. Surrounded mostly by brown-stone and slate roofed churches dating to the late 19th century, Ridge House has an expansive view of the Bay and San Francisco. Immediately adjacent to Ridge is Casa Zimbabwe. The two houses are joined at the hip by a structure added to the house in the mid 1960s, built at the time of CZ, (Casa Zimbabwe's) (then Ridge Project). The addition of this structure, which residents have affectionately dubbed the air-lock, expanded the capacity of Ridge from 28 residents to 38. Ridge House had also been modified during its conversion to a Co-op, by expanding the second floor onto what had formerly been the veranda, thereby moving the expansive deck to what is now the third floor.\n\nThe picturesque interior of Ridge House frequently serves as host to the BSC alumni association (BSCAA) as well as BSC functions and reunions.\n\nThe co-op is a faux Tudor mansion built in 1906 during the Decorative Art's Movement by John Galen Howard, noted architect of Doe Library and Sather Tower. Ridge House was commissioned by the University of California Berkeley for a prospective faculty member, who ultimately turned down the offer and the estate. The land, and historic Ridge House remained in University hands for a time, during which it was the temporary private residence of the Hearst children during their undergraduate years at U.C. Berkeley. Following its use by the Hearst family, the house became a sorority house for the University. As a co-op, Ridge House, purchased by the Berkeley Student Cooperative, (formerly the University Student Cooperative Association) in 1944, was originally all-male, but was later opened to all gender identities. Although now retrofitted for the purposes of student housing, there are still four working Rumford fireplaces, exposed, half-timber redwood beams, a secret passageways and the remnants of an archaic subterranean speaker system used to pipe chamber music into various rooms of the house. The Second floor of the house has retained most of the original features of the home. This included the Ballroom, which has remained largely intact and now serves as the Dining room for the Ridgelings. The former dining room, found on the same floor was converted into an extension of the kitchen following a remodeling of this space in 1989. This reutilization included the construction of a second door to the kitchen and the concealment of the dining room fireplace behind a false wall. Changes to this floor also included the conversion of the balcony on this floor into an additional room, with the balcony elevated to the third-floor. While the library and drawing room have been both converted into living spaces, Ridge House none-the-less maintains the greatest ratio of common space to numbers of residents, per capita, of houses in the BSC. Ridge currently sits on roughly 1/2 acre of land, all that remains of the original parcel that once span from Euclid Avenue to Scenic. While the land to the east is now occupied by Casa Zimbabwe (formerly known as Ridge Project), the two houses share a common courtyard and Ridge maintains an ample garden, which services both as a respite from urban living and a way of growing fresh fruits and veggies for its members.\n\nIn 2012, Ridge House celebrated its 75-year of affiliation with the Berkeley Student Cooperative. In 2014, Ridge House was structurally retrofitted to enable it to better withstand seismic stress.\n\nThe short film \"Peep Show\" (originally produced for Campus Moviefest by Ridgeling Kyan Krumdieck and shown at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival) was in part filmed at Ridge House.\n\nProminent alums of Ridge House include:\n\nSherman Hall houses 40 women (called \"Shermaids\", \"Shermanites\", or \"Shermanistas\") and is one of the two women-only houses in BSC. Sherman is located on the South Side of Berkeley near the California Memorial Stadium and IHouse on 2250 Prospect Street. Nearby co-ops include Davis (next-door), Castro, Afro, and Loth. Many vegan or vegetarian Shermanites board at Loth (the vegetarian-themed house) in order to have both a high standard of living (Sherman is not known for its cleanliness) while simultaneously meeting their dietary needs.\n\nSherman was originally a sorority house, but was purchased by the BSC in the 1940s. Since then it has housed all women, except during the summer, when it is open to men as well. Sherman Hall will be undergoing a retrofit during the summer of 2012.\n\nStebbins Hall is located on the north side of the University of California, Berkeley campus, on the lot of the Pierce family's original Victorian home. The Pierces were a wealthy family, responsible for many architectural landmarks in the city of Berkeley. They built the Cloyne Court Hotel, a \"high class modern apartment house\" in 1904, which was later converted into another student co-op. In 1927, the Pierce house was torn down to make way for Hotel Slocum. The University Student Cooperative Association purchased the property in 1950 as a site for the first all-women cooperative house, and it remained this way until 1971 when Stebbins Hall became coed.\n\nThe green hands on the front of the building were painted by residents of Cloyne as a prank, when Cloyne was all men and Stebbins was all women. Residents refer to themselves as \"Stebbinites,\" and claim the lizard as their mascot.\n\nStebbins Hall is named after Lucy Ward Stebbins, former Dean of Women at University of California, Berkeley. During her time in office, she increased the enrollment of women from 1,200 to 6,400 by raising money for scholarships, expanding curriculum, encouraging women to participate in student government, and creating housing opportunities. During her office, the schools of Nursing and Social welfare were established, as well as the departments of Decorative Arts and Home Economics. Lucy Ward also founded the Women's Faculty Club, one of the earliest female faculty organizations to exist at a co-ed university. In the summer of 2013 there was an attempt to change the name of the hall to the cool and modern Two Hand House, however the motion was ultimately defeated.\n\nStebbins Hall houses 64 students during the school year and 41 or more in the summer.\n\nThe African American Theme House is located close to the University of California, Berkeley, near Memorial Stadium and the International House. It is the second smallest house in the BSC and houses 21 residents (11 during summer). The house is open to all students, not just African American students. House members promote the theme by doing community service and hosting student group events. The building was originally the Slavic House for the University of California, Berkeley. BSC bought the house in 1997 and converted it to an African American themed cooperative.\n\nThe African American Theme House is one of two themed houses in BSC.\n\nAfrican-American Theme House members affectionately call each other \"Afros\" and the house \"Afro House.\"\n\nThe Convent is located at 1601 Allston Street, about a mile from the UC Campus. Because it is located on University of California property, all residents are required to be UC students (as is also true of Cloyne Court).\n\nUntil the opening of the Hillegass/Parker House coop in 2005, The Convent was the only BSC coop housing only graduate and re-entry students, and the only coop in which all residents had single rooms. With an older resident population and a more isolated location, it has a reputation for being quieter and cleaner than other coops.\n\nThe Convent gets its name from the fact that it occupies a former convent. Its rec room is a converted chapel, and like the building, has kept the name.\n\nEuclid is one of the smaller BSC houses, with 24 residents. The residents of Euclid Hall are affectionately referred to as \"Euclidians\". It is named after Euclid Avenue, the main street leading north into the hills above the Berkeley campus.\n\nEuclid Hall was originally the University of California Japanese Students' Club, built after the 1923 Berkeley fire destroyed the building which previously stood on the location. During World War II, when Japanese and Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from the west coast, the building was leased to BSC, which returned it to a JSC alumni group, the Nisei Alumni of the University of California, in 1947. The building reopened in the spring semester of 1948 as Euclid Hall, and was open to students of any background, with preference given to Nisei students without housing. In 1967, faced with declining occupancy, Euclid Hall was re-leased to BSC, which eventually purchased it in 1972.\n\n\nAlexander Mardsen Kidd Hall houses 17 students; the smallest house in BSC. Located in a wooded neighborhood two blocks north of the UC Berkeley campus, Kidd Hall features a backyard redwood forest-niche intersected by Strawberry Creek. The house also features a basketball court and one of few wheelchair accessible rooms in BSC.\n\nKidd Hall has 7 double rooms and 3 highly prized single rooms after reconstruction in 1989 which converted two triple rooms into three singles and a double.\n\nWolf House houses 29 residents, known as \"wolves.\" The house is located one house down from Piedmont Avenue between the Wright Institute and Kappa Kappa Gamma, and two blocks from the University of California. This is part of the Southside area of Berkeley, an area dominated by sororities and fraternities.\n\nThe house was built by Julia Morgan for the Rector of St. Mark's Church, the Rev. Edward L. Parsons, in 1905 and originally situated just above Telegraph Avenue on Durant at 2532. In 1915, with the commercialization of the neighborhood, the family of Rev. Parsons decided to have the house moved up Durant Avenue to 2732, next to the corner of Piedmont. At that time the front porch was enclosed and the location of the front door changed to fit the lot, under the supervision of the architect. When Rev. Parsons became the Episcopal Bishop of California, the family moved to San Francisco. The house was first rented and then sold. The house was the location of a sorority before being bought by BSC in 1974.\n\nIn 2002, to make the building accessible to disabled residents, BSC added a ramp that ran the length of the house along Durant to the front door, bisecting the front stairs.\n\nState Historical Resources Inventory, August 15, 1978, compiled by Sara Holmes Boutelle (author – \"Julia Morgan, Architect\"). Her sources include:\n\nThe Fenwick Weaver's Village, commonly known as Fenwick, is an apartment complex located on the Southside of the UC Berkeley campus. Fenwick houses 102 residents in one-bedroom to four-bedroom apartments.\n\nThe Northside Apartments are an apartment complex in Berkeley, California, which are part of the BSC co-op system. All the apartments are studios or one-bedroom apartments, and are highly prized in BSC. Due to BSC's seniority system for allocating apartments, most of the inhabitants of the Northside Apartments are graduate students or long-term (more than 4-year) undergrads who've been members of BSC for most of their time at Berkeley.\n\nUnlike the other BSC houses, which are more like student-run dorms, BSC's three apartment complexes have no food service, and much lighter workshift requirements.\n\nThe Rochdale Apartments is an apartment complex in Berkeley, California, which is part of the BSC coop system. Rochdale Village was named after the English town of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, where the Rochdale Pioneers developed the Rochdale Principles of cooperation\n\nIn 1970, the City of Berkeley, the University of California, and the Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC) entered into a visionary collaborative to expand the supply of low-cost housing for University students. The result was the financing and construction of Rochdale Village, one of the first student housing projects in the nation to receive HUD (United States Department of Housing and Urban Development) financing under the sponsorship of an independent nonprofit student housing organization.\n\nThe apartments were constructed in 1971 on the site of a former Berkeley public school, the McKinley Continuation School which closed down in the late 1960s, and except for its Haste Street Annex building (now restored, but moved to a new location), was razed.\n\nAlmost forty years later, Rochdale Village still plays a critical role in the supply of low-cost apartment housing for an ethnically and economically diverse group of UC Berkeley students. Rents are as low as $1,788 per member per semester, qualifying Rochdale Village as perhaps the most affordable student housing in the City. Almost 80% of the 259 current residents of Rochdale Village participate in the University's Educational Opportunity Program, reserved for students of a low-income or educationally disadvantaged background.\n\nRochdale Village also serves as a lynchpin of the University's support system for disabled students. For disabled students on SSI, Rochdale Village is virtually the only affordable housing near campus. Each year BSC continues to add additional disabled accessible units to the seven that already exist at Rochdale Village.\n\nGoverned and run by UC students according to cooperative principles, Rochdale Village also serves as a community center and leadership development hub for a number of student organizations, including Hermanos Unidos and Raza.\n\nIn addition to paying off the HUD loan of more than $2 million without default, BSC has invested several million more in maintaining and improving Rochdale Village. Among these investments are \"energy saving\" improvements, including an extensive array of solar panels on the roof and high-efficiency furnaces and water heaters.\n\nAt the end of the Spring Semester of 2009, the ground lease between the UC Regents and the Berkeley Student Cooperative will end. The land and all of the improvements will then revert to the University. The student residents of Rochdale formed a \"Save Rochdale; Save our Home\" campaign in November 2009 and renewed the lease for 10 years under the same conditions.\n\nThe following facilities were once owned and/or operated by the BSC, but are now closed or otherwise defunct.\n\nRight below Casa Zimbabwe are the BSC's Central Office and the Central Kitchen and Central Maintenance facilities.\n\nCentral Office handles all of the applications to BSC and determines where members will be placed. Placement is based on how long the applicant has been a member of BSC, the member's preferences, and the number of vacancies in their preferred house(s).\n\nCentral Kitchen handles and delivers the food orders for all of the houses but not the apartments. Food orders are handled on the house level by the Food or Kitchen Managers. Central Kitchen also handles the supply orders for all of the houses, such as toilet paper and cleaning supplies, as well as the furniture orders for both the houses and the apartments.\n\nCentral Maintenance is responsible for major work on the houses, including major projects or renovations. Most minor work is handled by house Maintenance Managers.\n\nThe BSC offers priority to students in the UC Berkeley Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) (or equivalent at their respective college or university), students with disabilities, transfer students, undocumented students, and international students studying abroad at a University of California campus.\n\nAt the house or apartment complex level, residents have the option of electing a \"WRM\" Waste-reduction Manager. These managers are responsible for recycling plastics, glass, paper, cardboard as well as composting. Waster-reduction Managers usually maintain color-coded bins, post information sheets and hold workshops/seminars to help residents make sustainable choices. WRMs can fine residents who do not follow house/apartment sustainability policies. The BSC also incorporates food waste reduction strategies into its food management system, by coordinating collections of compost. Cooperative living is sustainable in the sense that group living involves shared meals and facilities that can contribute to less waste, reduction in resource use, and collaboration in sustainable efforts.\n\n\n\n"}

His father was a notable Swiss colonizer (from Vordemwald, Aargau), and the special character that distinguished Schaerer was inherited from him. Schaerer was married to Mrs. Matilde Heisecke (Christian Heisecke daughter, a German diplomatic and consul of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), she had seven children with him, one that deserves to be mentioned, was Arturo Schaerer Heisecke, director of the newspaper La Tribuna after his father, and received the Maria Moors Cabot Prize, journalism award of the Columbia University, in 1953.\n\nHis elementary education was conducted in his hometown, and the high school level, in the National High School of the Capital. From a young age he went into business, politics and journalism. He was one of the founders of the newspaper \" El Diario \" with Gualberto Cardús Adolfo Huerta and Adolfo Riquelme, and founder of La Tribuna (Paraguay), newspaper of his single property that was for over half a century the head of the national press. He died in Buenos Aires on November 12, 1941.\n\nThe name of Eduardo Schaerer had been spoken repeatedly in the city, as the only one capable of guiding the difficult circumstances that became apparent in the future. He assumed the presidency of the Republic from August 15, 1912 until August 15, 1916. His cabinet was composed of: Eusebio Ayala, Foreign Affairs; Manuel Gondra, War and Navy; Félix Paiva, Justice, Culture and Public Instruction; Jerónimo Zubizarreta, Finances and José P. Montero, Interior. There were some changes later: Gondra went to the chancery, Colonel Patricio A. Escobar War and Navy; Eusebio Ayala to Treasury, Culture and Public Instruction and Belisario Rivarola to Justice.\n\nWith his government a period of political stability and economic prosperity that lasted nearly a decade began. In 1912, Dr. Manuel Franco was appointed rector of the University. In 1913 the resignation of Doctor Teodosio González was accepted to his chair of Criminal Law and Mr. Simeon Carísimo was director of the National School of Villarrica, where Francisco Ruffinellis began to exert the chair of Geography.\n\nIt began operating the C.A.L.T. (Predecessor of the A.N.D.E.), counting with the first electric lighting system in the country, and the first telephone system and electric tram.\n\nAt the beginning of his administration, Paraguay had 180 km of railways that reached the city of Villarrica. In 1916 at the end of his government they counted nearly 700 km of railways. In 1913 the railroad reaches the city of Encarnacióm and assembled with the rail line enabling the city of Posadas (Argentina) allowing the fast arrival of Paraguayan products to the Atlantic Ocean. Also the construction of a railway network began in the Department of Concepción that should have connected with the Brazilian system and the new railway company Carlos Casado in the Chaco. But above all it must be mentioned the construction of the branch to Abaí that should have connected with Brazil and get way out to the ocean for export products. Manuel gondra with his ministers and Eusebio Ayala was the precursor to the development of this country and a new geopolitical concept for Paraguay. In this regard also, in 1915 he was presented the first study for the hydroelectric development of the Saltos del Guaira, precursor idea of the current Itaipu.\n\nIn urban, during his tenure a new Municipal Organic Law, in Asuncion numerous public works began a period of major urban transformations were performed took effect.\n\nDuring his administration, a new Municipal Organic Law came into force. There were carried out several public works, as improving public parks, street paving, demolition and relocation to the old central market, demolition of the former House of Governors, for opening a Centennial Walk.\n\nIn the educational field, by decree it included the learning of English in the secondary school curriculum. Villarrica, Encarnacion, Pillar, also in Barrero Grande: the first rural normal schools in three of the historic villas were created.\n\nIt was the first Paraguayan president since Carlos Antonio Lopez sent scholarship to Europe and United States. During his government sent more than 200 Paraguayans to important European universities, among which we can mention promising men like Silvio Pettirossi, Bruno Guggiari Nicolas Sarubbi, Tomas Romero Pereira, Pedro Ciancio, Pedro Calunga, Anselmo Jover Peralta and many others.\n\nDefense regarding the aid was promoted to veterans and June 23, 1915 the Military Academy, which would be essential for the formation of a high-level military class would defend the Chaco years later was created.\n\nIn 1913 during his tenure, the former American President Theodore Roosevelt visited Paraguay.\n\nIn the Judiciary order Dr. Cecilio Báez was appointed to the Superior Court, Federico Chaves was appointed prosecutor of crime and Luis Ruffinelli defender of poor inmates in 1914, and in August 1915 Dr. Enrique Bordenave assumed the general secretariat of the presidency. In the same year he adopted the curriculum of the School of Commerce and it was expanded the law of regulation of secondary and higher education.\n\nThe cultural situation of the country received a motivation encouraged by Don Manuel Gondra, the \"thinking man\", one of the most important intellectual men of that time. Schaerer signed the appointments of poets and artists, as Rubén Darío, Narciso Colmán, Leopoldo Jimenez Ramos, Eloy Fariña Núñez, Delfín Chamorro, Manuel Ortiz Guerrero, Modesto Delgado Rodas, Justo Pastor, Federico Garcia; among others.\n\nOne of the most significant things was the continuing numbers of laws, beginning with the year 1913. Theses are distinguished: the permission to rid the public post office of San Lorenzo Ñu Guazú in (1912); one in which is resolved the acquisition of materials for the Museum of Natural History in (1913) and another one that set the continuation of the reconstruction work of the Oratory (Pantheon of the Heroes).\n\nOn January 1, 1915 people in Asuncion were awakened in early hours with a terrifying shooting. The bullets came from an uprising led by Dr. Freire Gomes Esteves and his brother, Luis Freire Esteves. As Colonel Manuel J. Duarte was absent, the military commanders were a captain, a lieutenant and a sergeant. They captured the president but the attempt failed.\n\nSchaerer was the first civilian President who managed to complete his mandate without conspiracies or military uprisings.\n\nIn the year 1904 he was part of the main civilians leaders of the liberal insurgency, he acted in Our Lady of Pilar, Ñeembucú. Schaerer emerged as one of the signatories of the manifesto read “to the People”, on July 4, 1908, with which the \"radical\" group tried to justify the uprising that was planned by mayor Albino Jara. He was mayor of the municipality of Asunción between July 5, 1908 and January 17, 1911. He also served as Director of Customs, Minister of the Interior (1912) and Senator (1921). On August 7 of that year, he signed the invitation to participate in the assembly of that style, which took place on the 15th at the National Theater, which at that time intended to \"constitute a large ruling party.\"\n\nSchaerer was the first civilian president who managed to finish its mandate without any hitting or military uprisings. He had an extremely important role in strengthening of institutions and the development of civil leader Paraguay and is remembered as one of the great builders of the Guarani nation.\n\nHe served as the President of the Senate in 1919-1920.\n\n"}

Gregory had anchored \"News Chat\", \"Crosstalk NBC\" and \"Newsfront\" on MSNBC from 1998 to 2000.\n\nGregory also filled in on NBC News \"Weekend Nightly News\" and \"NBC Nightly News\" from 2005 to 2014.\n\nGregory also filled the \"Imus in the Morning\" time slot on MSNBC after the Don Imus controversy involving the Rutgers University basketball team while MSNBC searched for a permanent host. He served as a guest host in the morning time slot for MSNBC (while also being simulcast on WFAN) for one week in May. The morning radio program was known as \"Gregory Live\".\n\nFrom March 17, 2008, through December 5, 2008, Gregory hosted a show on MSNBC weekday evenings, which replaced Tucker Carlson's \"Tucker\". The show was called \"Race for the White House\" until the conclusion of the 2008 U.S. Presidential election. From November 5, 2008, forward the show became known as \"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\". Gregory was replaced by David Shuster, who was named as the new host for \"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\" starting with the December 15, 2008 show.\n\nDue to internal fighting among the staff at MSNBC, Gregory was appointed as anchor on MSNBC during the presidential debates and the 2008 election. On November 4–5, he teamed with Rachel Maddow, Eugene Robinson, Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann as commentators on the presidential election.\nGregory became the moderator of \"Meet the Press\", beginning with the December 14, 2008, episode when he was introduced by interim moderator Tom Brokaw. The ratings fell, and he was replaced in 2014.\n\nDuring Gregory's tenure at \"Meet the Press\", the show's ratings fell to their lowest in 21 years and it regularly placed third among Sunday morning news shows. \"The Washington Post\" reported that NBC hired a \"psychological consultant\" to assess Mr. Gregory. NBC did not deny this, saying it had hired a \"brand consultant\" to evaluate how Gregory connected with the audience. On August 14, 2014, NBC announced Gregory would leave the parent network, with his hosting duties assumed by Chuck Todd. The \"New York Post\" reported NBC had paid Gregory $4 million to leave the network, and he had signed a non-disparagement clause. On August 17, 2014, Andrea Mitchell hosted \"Meet the Press,\" and paid brief tribute to Gregory's career at NBC, saying, \"In 20 years with NBC News, David has done it all... Through all the years, David has been true to the traditions of this program and NBC News.\"\n\nGregory's interaction with Bush's press secretaries was contentious at times, garnering media attention in several instances. Numerous commentators have used these incidents to characterize Gregory's reportage as proof of the news media's left-wing bias. Gregory has told Howard Kurtz that \"it's easy to divert attention against a familiar whipping boy\" and that \"I provide fodder for critics who say, 'Aha, they're out of control.'\"\n\nOn January 23, 2009, \"The Daily Beast\" columnist Ana Marie Cox stated that Barack Obama still has not discovered \"this administration's David Gregory.\" She used Gregory as a metaphor for a White House foil, and she described this as a figure that could be interpreted as either \"tough, news-oriented, and no-nonsense or showy, superficial, and self-indulgent.\"\n\nOn the December 23, 2012 broadcast of \"Meet the Press\" with National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre, Gregory displayed what he identified as \"a magazine for ammunition that carries 30 bullets.\" NBC had requested permission from the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to include a high-capacity magazine in the segment and were denied. Gregory displayed the magazine on the show, with media reports noting D.C. Code 7-2506.01(b) prohibits the possession of magazines with a capacity in excess of \"10 rounds of ammunition.\"\n\nOn December 26, 2012, MPD spokesmen confirmed the launch of an inquiry. When asked by CNN on December 27, 2012, if he thought Gregory should be prosecuted, NRA president David Keene responded, \"No, I don't think so... I really think what David Gregory did while he was inadvertently flouting the law was illustrating in a very graphic way, perhaps not intentionally, but in a graphic way just how silly some of these laws are.\" Other gun rights advocates argued that not charging Gregory would show D.C. police to be hypocritical in enforcing gun laws.\n\nOn January 8, 2013, a spokeswoman for D.C. police chief Cathy L. Lanier said her department had completed its investigation into the matter and referred it to the office of the District's attorney general to determine if Gregory would be prosecuted. D.C. attorney general Irvin B. Nathan announced three days later that although Gregory had violated the law, no charges would be filed against him or any other NBC employees. Stating, \"despite the clarity of the violation of this important law, because under all of the circumstances here a prosecution would not promote public safety in the District of Columbia nor serve the best interests of the people of the District to whom this office owes its trust.\"\n\nOn June 23, 2013, David Gregory posed a question to journalist Glenn Greenwald that \"The Washington Post\" described as a \"gotcha inquiry\" containing \"a veiled accusation of federal criminal wrongdoing, very much in the tradition of 'how long have you been beating your wife'\". According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Gregory's question disguised a loaded assumption\" that Greenwald aided and abbetted NSA leaker Edward Snowden before asking: \"[W]hy shouldn't you, Mr. Greenwald, be charged with a crime?\" Greenwald responded vigorously in objection to the question. The accusation itself became a news story. \"The New York Times\" said, \"If you tease apart his inquiry, it suggests there might be something criminal in reporting out important information from a controversial source.\" The Poynter Institute wrote, \"The obvious defense is that he was merely asking a question that evinced a viewpoint advanced by U.S. Rep. Peter King and \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen—that publishing secrets is law-breaking.\" Opinion columnist Frank Rich called Gregory's charges \"preposterous,\" questioning Gregory's own journalistic credentials and asking why he didn't also make similar accusations against \"Washington Post\" reporter Barton Gellman, who also published Snowden's leaks.\n\nSince June 2000, Gregory has been married to Beth Wilkinson, a Methodist. Wilkinson is a former federal prosecutor, former Fannie Mae executive vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary, and a lawyer representing four of Hillary Clinton's closest aides in the FBI's investigation of Clinton's email scandal. They met while Gregory was covering the Oklahoma City bombing as a reporter and Wilkinson was serving as prosecutor on the case. They have three children, Max, and twins Ava and Jed.\n\nGregory wrote \"How's Your Faith?,\" a book about his spiritual journey with Judaism, being born to interfaith parents and his marriage to a Christian. It was released in September 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

There were three branded divisions of Sky Box Office – Sky Cinema Box Office, Sky Sports Box Office and Sky 3D Box Office. Until 1 February 2011, the system ran under unified Sky Box Office branding. On 4 January 2017, all Sky Cinema Box Office channels ceased broadcasting, with only Sky Sports Box Office remaining available.\n\nSky Box Office launched on 16 March 1996 on Sky Analogue. At the time it carried mainly sporting events, such as major boxing fights. The first of these was Frank Bruno's WBC World Heavyweight Championship defence against Mike Tyson. Initially events were ordered by telephone, either on the day of broadcast for £14.95 or in advance at a reduced price of £9.99. Ordering an event charged the viewer and then the subscriber's VideoCrypt viewing card would be activated over the air, enabling the viewing of the broadcast. The charge would be levied unless the viewer cancelled prior to broadcast, or returned the viewing card as proof that the event hadn't been watched. On some occasions, Box Office events would be broadcast on other Sky channels, such as Sky Sports 3.\n\nFour dedicated Sky Box Office channels were launched on 1 December 1997 on Sky Analogue. At this time multiple showings of selected movies, shown in advance of their broadcast on Sky's existing subscription movie channels, were added. Initial movies included \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" and \"Courage Under Fire\". However, at least one hour pre-ordering was required, and for most movies one purchase at £2.99 only bought one viewing.\n\nWith the move to Sky Digital in 1998, where the Sky Digibox provided a data return path, events and movies – the latter now copy protected – could be bought minutes before or even during the event either by telephone or through an on-screen menu and PIN system.\n\nSky launched a sister pay-per-view channel in August 2001, Premiership Plus, which shown select football matches from the Premier League live. The service closed in 2007 as Sky were forced by the European Union to break their broadcasting monopoly on the competition.\n\nA range of pay-per-view 3-D films were also screened on Sky 3D.\n\nOn 1 February 2011, Sky Box Office was rebranded as Sky Movies Box Office for movies. Later in the year, Sky Sports Box Office branding was added for sports and Sky 3D Box Office for 3D.\n\nOn 4 January 2017, all Sky Cinema Box Office channels ceased broadcasting, with only Sky Sports Box Office remaining available.\n\nAlthough at launch it showed mainly sporting events, since the launch of Sky Digital, movies along with concerts became the predominant content. However, Sky Cinema Box Office's limited movie choices and relatively high prices increasingly left it suffering in comparison to online DVD rental systems. As of 2011, films were first shown on Sky Box Office on the same day as DVD release, prior to that there was a 2 to 3-month window between DVD release and Sky Box Office release. Some films still retained the 2 to 3-month window between DVD and Sky Box Office releases. Since 2017 only sports content is available for purchase.\n\nContent can be purchased directly through a Sky remote control. This can be accomplished by pressing \"Box Office\", purchase an event, confirm the order and enter the PIN if prompted. They can also be ordered online via Sky Box Office.\n\n\n"}

He had several wives: Queen Limmiti, who was the daughter of the King of Limmu-Ennarea; Queen Minjo, the daughter of the King of Kaffa; and Queen Sapertiti, also from Limmu-Ennarea.\n\nDuring his reign there were Sufi saints who supported his rule. One of them is Sadati Of Bure, who later migrated to Illubabor.\n\nIn the 1880s, Abba Jifar II conquered a portion of the Kingdom of Janjero, which lay east of Jimma, along the Omo River, and incorporated it into his kingdom.\n\nDue to the advice of his mother Queen Gumiti, to avoid the detriments of war, he agreed to submit to Menelik II, \"negus\" of Shewa in 1884. In 1886, Abba Jifar II paid peace offerings consisting of \"slaves (including eunuchs), ivory, bamboo internodes filled with civet, jars of honey, locally made cloth, spears, shields ornamented with silver plates, and objects of wood (including stools).\" Because of these \"shrewd politics\" (Herbert S. Lewis' words), which included providing military assistance to Menelik in conquering the neighboring kingdoms of Kullo (1889), Walamo (1894), and Kaffa (1897), he was able to preserve the autonomy of Jimma until his death. On the other hand, Alexander Bulatovich states that, when Jimma was annexed to Ethiopia, Emperor Menelik imprisoned Aba Jifar \"for inspiring excessive enthusiasm in his own standing army and trying to entice Abyssinian soldiers to his own service\" in Ankober for a year. \"When he was freed,\" Bulatovich continues, \"Aba Jefar again received the throne of Jimma from Menelik.\"\n\nQueen Gumiti also advised him to expand the cultivation of coffee in his kingdom, which provided increased revenue for him and his subjects.\n\nIn January 1898, as part of a Red Cross mission to southwestern Ethiopia, Bulatovich visited Jimma, and was the guest of Abba Jifar. While in Jeren, Bulatovich treated the Queen Mother for \"a little bronchitis\". He left the following description of the king:\n\nAba Jefar is still a young man -- handsome, well-built, and somewhat in his prime. He has a typical face: a straight thin nose; bright, handsome eyes which shift suspiciously from side to side; a thick black beard; and black, short-cropped, curly hair. His hands are graceful. He wears large gold rings on all his fingers. Dressed in a white shirt and trousers, he has draped over his shoulders the thinnest white shamma. His feet are also very small and handsome, clad in leather sandals.\n\nTowards his later years, Abba Jifar II succumbed to senility. His grandson Abba Jofir attempted to take control and re-assert Jimma's independence. However, Emperor Haile Selassie responded quickly and sent military forces against Abba Jofir. The soldiers brought Abba Jofir back to Addis Ababa, where he was imprisoned.\n\nIn 1930, Haile Selassie removed an enfeebled Abba Jifar II from power and installed his son-in-law, \"Ras\" Desta Damtew, in his place. Desta Damtew ruled as Governor (\"Shum\") of Jimma, while Abba Jifar II was allowed to remain as King (\"Negus\") as titular head. When Abba Jifar II died in 1932, the Kingdom of Jimma was officially ruled directly by the Emperor.\n"}

He was a member of the Liberal Party. He was overthrown by Rafael Franco.\n\nAyala was born in Barrero Guasu (Barrero Grande), Cordillera Department, Paraguay, on August 14, 1875; his parents were Abdón Bordenave and Casimira Ayala, his mother an illiterate adolescent of 19. His first schooling was in his hometown, with his aunt Benita. Then he moved to the country's capital, Asunción, where he worked as a trainee in a shop. He was able to enter the National College of Asunción and received his bachelor's degree in 1896. Ayala then taught classes in schools, through which he could afford his expenses at the College of Law, National University, where he graduated as Doctor of Social Science and Law in 1904, defending a thesis on the national budget.\n\nAfter completing his university education, Ayala made several trips to Europe. The first was as secretary of the embassy of Great Britain for three years, time that he came to master English and French, and also improve his philosophical and cultural training. It was in one of those trips where he met the person who would be his future wife, Madame Marcelle Amelia Durand. She was born in Tours, France, January 16, 1889. She had gotten married at very young age to a Parisian jeweler, but he suffered from a mental problem that drove him to suicide, leaving Marcelle a childless widow. After the incident, she continued living in Paris, where she met Eusebio Ayala. Marcelle lived until his last days in Paraguay. Marcelle Ayala died in Asuncion on April 20, 1954. Her years close to the statesman were recorded in his book \"Memories\".\n\nUpon his return to Paraguay, he taught classes of Criminal Law and Constitutional Law at the Faculty of Law and he became Rector of the University of Asunción.\n\nAs a journalist he worked at \"El Diario\" and \"El Liberal\", and later he was editor of the Journal of Law and Social Sciences. Jose P. Guggiari appointed him ambassador to the United States. He was reminded, as the only Paraguayan of that era who gave a lecture in The Sorbonne, Paris, on the uti possidetis (the thing possessed) in a clear and correct French. Fruit of his research in finance, he wrote a book which he called \"Monetary issues and related topics\" in 1917.\n\nAyala died in Buenos Aires on June 4, 1942. To commemorate him the old San Lorenzo street and his hometown in Paraguay were renamed after him, on June 17, 1942.\n\nFollowing the resignation of President Manuel Gondra, the National Congress named Eusebio Ayala as temporary president on November 7, 1921, due to a political crisis and the impossibility of forming a government by Vice President Félix Paiva. Ayala served in this position until April 12, 1923. These were extremely difficult times for the country, and Ayala's presidency played a role in the civil war of 1922, during which he resigned his post and defeated political opponents who staged an insurrection after Ayala blocked their attempts to hold a presidential election. \n\nAyala became president again between August 15, 1932 and February 17, 1936. He came into office just when the Chaco War with Bolivia (1932–1935) was beginning. Dr. Ayala visited the battlefront several times during the war, and the Paraguayan forces ultimately won despite being outmanned and under-equipped. For this, he was called \"President of Victory.\"\n\nThe war consumed most of the energy of the Government during Ayala's second term, but he undertook some other tasks as president, such as the formalization of the restored version of the National Anthem. During the war, he held the three main pillars of his policy: As Commander-in-Chief, along with General José Félix Estigarribia, he led successful campaigns of the Army; implemented a progressive system of expenses; and maintained a diplomatic directive with the strong desire to achieve peace with dignity.\n\nAfter the war, a military movement overthrew Ayala's presidency on February 17, 1936, a few months before the end of his term. He was imprisoned and then exiled, relocating to Buenos Aires.\n\nIn his long political career he was legal adviser to major corporations, deputy, senator, minister of Finance, Justice, Worship and Education and Foreign Affairs. He served as President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1909.\n\nHe joined the Liberal Party in 1908 and campaigned in the \"radical\" sector. During the presidency of Emiliano González Navero, in 1909, he was appointed chancellor, a position he also held in following governments. He was also one of the founders of the Paraguayan Society of International Law and became a delegate of the International Financial Conference, held in Buenos Aires in 1916.\n\nAccompanied by General Estigarribia, Dr. Eusebio Ayala left Paraguay on September 5, 1936, to Buenos Aires, where his wife and a reception with all the honors were waiting for him.\nHe resumed his activities by the year 1938. He joined a major law firm in Buenos Aires, and led the Argentine–Paraguayan Chamber. He also wrote for \"La Razon\", a local newspaper. His son, Roger, had finished his studies and lived with his parents. Ayala returned to Asuncion to do some work business, and took advantage of this opportunity to visit his sister.\n\nOn September 28, 1992, the remains of Eusebio Ayala arrived on a special flight at Silvio Pettirossi international airport from Buenos Aires. A vehicle of the Army transported the urn to the “Palacio de Lopez”, under the greeting of the Paraguayan flags. On September 29, 1992, the remains of Dr. Eusebio Ayala finally rested in his country, in the National Pantheon of the Heroes in Asuncion.\n\n"}

Honorably that I have done so as not to defraud, in the midst of many and powerful contrarieties. “As a new Congress president he appointed doctor Luis. A.

Married to Mrs. Rosa Ramona Rojas, he was the father of María Estela and José Antonio Guggiari Rojas (married to Alejandrina Marasco). She also had Clementina (married to Miguel Peralta).\n\nDelivered by his father to commercial and industrial tasks with members of his family, the little José Patricio is taken to Villarrica del Espiritu Santo, where he will later pick up the persuasive oratories - which made him famous - very evident characteristic of that historic region . There he attended primary school.\n\nHe started and completed secondary studies at the Colegio Nacional de la Capital and in 1901 he graduated with a bachelor's degree in science and letters. He immediately begins his university career.\n\nIn 1910 he graduated as a doctor in law and social sciences, but his inclination would not be professional but political.\n\nIt is worth remembering some tasks prior to his arrival at the first magistracy to expose his capacity for service. On August 8, 1904 is among those who pass to the Argentine shore to discover the liberal conspiracy. On April 30, 1906, he signed the founding charter of the League of Independent Youth, whose original he had until the end of his days. He also hold the positions of Criminal Prosecutor and later as Attorney General of the State between the years 1908 and 1910. Subsequently, he fully incorporates himself into liberalism, which he was to head in 1924.\n\nDeputy, in 1913; President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1918, 1923 and 1924-1927. In the interim he worked as interior minister for Manuel Gondra (1920), being that the pretext for the military uprising. Then deputy again, in 1924.\nHe assumed the presidency of the Republic on August 15, 1928, from Eligio Ayala.\n\nHe was the first democratically elected president with free political participation in the history of Paraguay, defeating the candidate of the Asociación Nacional Republicana, Mr. Eduardo Fleitas.\n\nIn the Government, he was seconded by Vice President Emiliano González Navero and his Cabinet were made up of Eligio Ayala, Rodolfo González and Justo Pastor Benítez, in the Ministry of Finance; Belisario Rivarola, Luis De Gásperi, Justo Pastor Benítez and Víctor Abente Haedo, in Interior; Rodolfo González, Eladio Velásquez, Justo Pastor Prieto, Justo Pastor Benítez and Alejandro Arce, in Justice, Worship and Public Instruction; Eliseo Da Rosa, Manlio Schenoni and Raúl Casal-Ribeiro, in Guerra y Marina; Gerónimo Zubizarreta and Higinio Arbo, in External Relations.\n\nIn 1928, the National Congress of Defense was constituted, with little success, despite the circumstances; in 1929, after arduous debates, the Archdiocese of Asunción was created (which was not intended to be more than an autonomous expression), being named Juan Sinforiano Bogarín as the first archbishop. In 1931 the old town of Ajos was renamed \"Coronel Oviedo\", in homage to one of its most illustrious sons, who still lived. The respective Schools of Dentistry and Economic Sciences were created, the basis of the Faculties that arrived later. Education, both civilian and military, had not been neglected; in 1929 the Law 1,048 of University Reform was sanctioned, that had been towing since 1926. In 1931 a new plan of studies for the National School is established and the military order the Superior School of War was enabled. Humaitá and Paraguay gunboats were also acquired, which were key during the Chaco War, which began towards the end of his government.\n\nBy then there were 810 primary schools, 2,452 teachers and 108,222 students.\n\nMeanwhile, the incipient left was also active from the manifesto of the \"New National Ideology\" (1929) and from \"The Word\" (1930), both by the Paraguayan Communist Party, specifying its activity with the occupation of Encarnación and its corresponding proclamation of revolution on February 20, 1931, that failed \n\nIn March of that year, a \"military uprising\" was conjured up, awarded to the then mayor Rafael Franco. The tragic event that occurred on October 23, left a deep scar not only in the judgment of his government but in the sensitivity of his own person. The protest had originated because President Guggiari decided to keep his movements in the Chaco in secret because it was dangerous to share them with the press because he could alert the adversary, who at the time was Bolivia.\n\nThe University Students Center, led by Agustín Ávila, called for a march on the eve, on October 22, 1931, from the Plaza Uruguaya. From there they left for the Palace to demonstrate before the President of the Republic, Dr. José Patricio Guggiari. When they did not find the President, they continued to walk down the streets, without being stopped by the police, and they arrived to his home. Speeches were made and the house was stoned, already in a mob situation. Previously, they had been harangued by then-Major Rafael Franco. The students were, in the end, abruptly dispersed by the police.\n\nThe next day, students from the National College and the Normal School were invited to a new demonstration to protest the hostility shown by the police force on the eve. The column of students went through the newsrooms, threw stones at the premises of El Liberal and arrived at the Government Palace, where the President of the Republic was. The mood went on and the crowd ran over the protective police cordon of the Palace, heading to the staircase that led to the presidential office. The situation went out of control and a burst of machine gun left the guard of the Palace and generated mournful scenes. President Guggiari appeared on the balcony, ordering a cease-fire. \nThen, refugee in the Military School, he delegated the presidential command in González Navero and asked the National Congress for his political judgment.\nIt was the first case of impeachment brought to term in the history of the country.\n\nThose serious events occurred, occasion in which the quota of energy was in charge of the Cnel. Arturo Bray, according to his own memories, Dr. Guggiari requested his trial by Congress, transferring from that date and until January 17, 1932, the first magistracy to the vice president, who was Mr. Emiliano González Navero. The parliament, acquitted him of guilt and punishment. With this he became the first Latin American president to be subjected to a political trial and acquitted of charges.\n\nThere is a theory that says that the Paraguayan Communist Party was behind the riots.\n\nWith the revolution of February 17, 1936 and the resignation of President Eusebio Ayala, José P., as he was known, leaves Paraguayan territory and remained a time in Clorinda and Formosa, where he receives the alarming news that the president of the Víctor y, Dr. Ayala and the glorious war leader, General José Félix Estigarribia, were detained. Later he moved to Buenos Aires, where he established a residence. He was married to Rosa Rojas. His children accompanied him in exile, especially Maria Stella, who was a nurse in the Chaco War, and who resided in Rosario, Argentina. Her other daughter Clementina was married to Wenceslao Peralta and both settled in La Colmena and the grandchildren: José, Titín, Pedro Bruno, Teresa and Martha. The only son of José P. was named José Antonio.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, despite the exile, the sadness and nostalgia, he was permanently surrounded by his compatriots, the great Paraguayan community, and also there he was the undisputed idol of those people and without forgetting the Argentines who also lavished so that José P., felt like in his own country.\n\nIn June 1940, during the presidency of General Estigarribia, with the news of the death of his mother, he returned to Paraguay, by train, to Villarrica. He returned to exile during the presidency of General Higinio Morínigo, in September 1940. When, in 1946, President Morínigo took a turn for democracy, an amnesty for all Paraguayans, the return of José P., on August 14 was memorable. Day of sun and lapachos with beautiful flowers. There had never been a comparable crowd, surpassing in quantity, the visits years after two American leaders: Juan Domingo Perón and Getulio Vargas.\n\nThe happy days of the democratic spring lasted only 6 months and returned to exile and there for many years, until his death on October 29, 1957.\n\n\"The pride of being a liberal is only overcome by the honor of being Paraguayan\", famous phrase of the liberal politician.\n"}

His book, \"Uprooot: Travels in 21st-Century Music and Digital Culture\", was published in 2016.\n\nClayton spent his teenage years in North Andover, Massachusetts. In the mid-1990s, Clayton was a member of Toneburst, described as \"Boston's most active and visible experimental electronic art/music/DJ collective\", pursuing \"a steadfastly DIY aesthetic\". Clayton graduated from Harvard University with a B.A. in English.\n\nIn 2001, Clayton (under the name DJ /rupture) released \"Gold Teeth Thief\", initially as an internet download.

The track was released by the Violent Turd label in 2002. Reviewing \"Gold Teeth Thief\" on AllMusic, Joshua Glazer wrote: \"\"Gold Teeth Thief\" is an impossibly noisy and aggressive set, yet the earthy Jamaican vocals and blunted hip-hop beats counteract the sonic devastation, making it palatable, even at its most dissident.\"\n\nIn 2005, Clayton was asked to write about \"the 10 artists that impacted my view of electronic music\" and he mentioned: Edgard Varèse, the Hanatarashi, King Tubby, Pere Ubu, Steely & Clevie, Gregory Whitehead, Timbaland, Mannie Fresh, DJ Scud and Wiley.\n\nBetween June 6, 2007 and February 27, 2013, DJ /rupture hosted a 1-hour weekly radio program \"Mudd Up!\" on WFMU.\n\nIn 2010, Clayton was a resident at Eyebeam, an arts research organization specialising in the interface between art and technology.\n\nIn 2012, Clayton received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.

He was a founder of the Revolutionary Febrerista Party.\n\nHe was accused of trying to unseat General Alfredo Stroessner in November 1956, but he adamantly denied this. He returned to Paraguay in 1957 and until his death in 1973 he was the leader of the Partido Febrerista.\n\nFranco was born in Asunción on October 22, 1896, in the \"barrio\" of Santísima Trinidad.\n\nHe was the son of Federico Franco and Marcelina Ojeda. His father was a professor of mathematics at the School of Agronomy, founded by Moisés Santiago Bertoni, and in 1940 she was transferred to San Lorenzo).\n\nHe was married to Deidamia Solalinde and they had six children. After conducting his basic studies, Franco entered the Military College in 1915. \n\nFranco's first assignment, with the rank of second lieutenant, was to Encarnación in the Department of Itapúa under the command of Colonel Pedro Mendoza. On May 9, 1921, Franco was promoted to first lieutenant in the infantry and, on August 13 of the same year he was appointed commander of the machine gun group, with its seat in Asunción.\n\nHe was commander of Infantry Regiment No. 5 under General Eduvigis Diaz, based in Bahía Negra. On August 13, 1924, Franco was promoted to captain. On February 10, 1926, he was appointed commander of the company cadets of the Military College. He was assigned important tasks, such as training new cadres of officers or troops. In November 1926, he was appointed commander of Infantry Regiment No. 2, with a seat in Villa Hayes.\n\nFranco was next assigned to the Paraguayan Chaco. In 1928, acting without orders, Major Franco led an attack that seized and destroyed a Bolivian fort in the Chaco that had been constructed inside Paraguayan territory. Franco was later removed from his command for this action. In August 1928, Franco was appointed commander of the Military Aviation School. \n\nPromoted to colonel in 1933, Franco commanded the first division of the Paraguayan Third Corps in the Chaco War. Franco soon developed a tactic of using long-range patrols to explore weaknesses in the enemy lines. After finding gaps in the Bolivian defenses at Alihuatá, Franco launched a surprise attack on July 12, 1933, that quickly penetrated enemy defenses, forcing the Bolivian 4th Division into headlong retreat.\n\nFranco later became the director of Paraguay's Military School At the end of the war, Franco participated in the Victory Parade as commander of the Second Corps, where the Asunción crowd received him in the streets with acclamation. In 1933, he was promoted to the rank of colonel; on his initiative, Fort Mariscal López and Fort Falcón were built. Later, he took the leadership of Infantry Regiment No. 5 under General Diaz, with its seat in Bahía Negra. He suffered a leg injury due to an accident in his last years at the Military College, when he fell from a horse in the basement of the Cabildo. His troops called him by the affectionate nickname of \"Leon Carê.\"\n\nFranco was a founder and historic leader of Revolutionary Febrerista Party, a full member of the Socialist International. He had come to occupy the command of the Second Corps and conquer Laura important for the Army in defining campaign in part of the Chaco war as Picuiba, Yrendagué and took Carandayty, Charagua and Ingavi.\n\nFranco was critical of President Eusebio Ayala during the aftermath of the Chaco War. When Ayala exiled Franco to Argentina, Franco's sympathizers toppled Ayala's government, and Colonel Franco returned to Paraguay as interim president. He would serve from February 17, 1936 to August 13, 1937. \n\nThe Franco government introduced a number of labor reforms. It set the work day at 8 hours per day, made Sunday a mandatory day off, introduced the requirement that wage earners receive holidays, and limited the work week to 48 hours (35 hours for unhealthful workplaces). Wages were required to be paid in cash, rather than in vouchers or 'white money'. Other measures recognized workers' right to unionize and strike, as well as the rights of women workers. The government carried out Paraguay's first agrarian reform (5 May 1936), distributing over 200,000 ha of land to 10,000 peasant families, and introduced a one-year freeze on the prices of rents and leases.\n\nCertain measures increased the state's involvement in the economy. On 24 February 1936, the government created the Central Bank of the Republic of Paraguay, which took over the role of the Stock Exchange and also became the sole conduit for foreign trade. Rafael Franco proposed that the state should be involved in any oil exploration. His government also set a base price for certain key commodities such as cotton. In addition, the state merchant fleet was reorganized.\n\nThe Franco government provided access to Paraguay's first Japanese settlers, and also facilitated the return of Paraguayan prisoners of war from Bolivia.\n\nFranco undertook to restructure and modernize Paraguay's armed forces and sell weapons that had become worn-out or obsolete.\n\nHis government sought to acquire 60 Italian military aircraft in readiness for any threats from Paraguay's neighbours (including Bolivia) and in light of the serious developments then transpiring in Europe. Orders for these aircraft were later rejected by the liberal government that succeeded Rafael Franco's. As a result, only a small number of aircraft arrived. The original contract included:\n\nIn addition, the government provided pensions to veterans and the war wounded, and delivered decorations and salaries to the regular army.\n\nMaintained an adamant stance of not ceding any territory conquered by the Paraguayan army in the Chaco War.\n\nFranco claimed the ideals of the Revolution Communards and the Independence Revolution.\n\nFranco's government halted construction of the Oratory of Our Lady of the Assumption and established as the National Pantheon of Heroes. The government rehabilitated the 19th-century dictator Francisco Solano López, overturning the decrees that had him an outlaw and declaring him instead an unexampled National Hero. An expedition was sent to recover López' remains from his unmarked grave in Cerro Corá, which were reinterred in the new Pantheon. The government also declared Adolfo Rojas Silva a National Hero; he was the first officer to fall in the Chaco War.\n\nMarch 1 (Heroes' Day) was established as a public holiday.\n\nThe Franco government repealed the 1870 Constitution and parliament, and called for a National Constituent Assembly to draft a new and updated Great Charter.\n\nThe Franco government created two new ministries for Public Health and Agriculture, respectively. It also oversaw the creation of several other new agencies and bodies, including the National Association of the Indigenous, the National Labour Department, the national labour union federation (CNT), the National Women's Union, the Development and Labour Commission, the Civilian Mobilization Committee, the National Association of Ex-Combatants (UPV current Chaco) of which Franco was appointed as the first president, and the National Revolutionary Union.\n\nThe government issued a new series of banknotes of 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 heavy weights, and established a philatelic Section within the Directorate General of Post and Telegraph.\n\nImprovements to the country's infrastructure included the first civilian airport, work on ports, and the foundation of several hospitals in the country's interior.\n\nRafael Franco created two political formations to support his agenda, the \"Liga Nacional Independiente\" (Independent National League) and the \"Unión Nacional Revolucionaria\" (Revolutionary National Union). Conversely, the right-wing Liberal Party was forced underground.\n\nThe Franco government abolished entrance exams for National Schools and repealed fees on primary- and secondary-school studies. It also established a School of Dentistry, Faculties of Economics and of Agricultural Sciences, and the School of Arts and Trades. It opened hundreds of schools and colleges, including rural schools and opportunities for adult education.\n\n\nIn response to Franco's withdrawing Paraguayan troops from their advanced positions in the Chaco, right-wing sympathizers in the army staged a coup on 13 August 1937 which resulted in Franco's overthrow and led the Liberal Félix Paiva to assume the presidency. Franco fled to Uruguay. He would spend more than 20 years outside the country, only returning briefly to Paraguay in 1946 under an amnesty before fleeing again amidst accusations of conspiracy. From Uruguay, Franco supported a 1947 uprising against Moríñigo but denied involvement in a 1956 plot against Alfredo Stroessner.\n\nWhen he returned to Paraguay, he performed various jobs to survive. At one point, he was a real-estate broker. He continued his moderate opposition to Alfredo Stroessner's government through the Revolutionary Febrerista Party, which was legalized in 1964.\n\nHis health had been deteriorating in his late 70s. In the last years of his life, he lived in a small room that was originally a garage located in the streets of Herrera. From there, he sometimes walked to a cafe that was located on the Avenue. There he met with old friends and comrades with whom he talked of politics and on military and social issues.\n\nIn September 1973, Franco entered the Hospital Americano because of his serious condition and did not come out alive. He was visited by Colonel Arturo Bray, with whom he maintained an enmity over 30 years. Colonel Rafael Franco died on September 16, 1973. One of the largest flower wreaths were sent by Arturo Bray. The inscription read: \"To a great patriot.\"\n\n"}

He worked as a journalist for “General Caballero”, “El Sufragio” (The Suffrage), “El Colegiado” (The Scholar), which led him to suffer several repercussions and even being sent to prison in several occasions.

Having lost his parents, he moved to Asunción, Paraguay's capital, in 1912 to finish his high school studies. He graduated in 1915 from the Colegio Nacional de Asunción (Asunción's National College), and planned to study medicine in the Universidad Nacional de Asunción (Asunción's National University). However, that same year the government shut down the UNA's medical school. Meanwhile, Natalicio started developing a career as journalist and writer, and became affiliated with the Colorado Party. He had no further formal education, but he achieved an outstanding intellectual level through a very disciplined self-education.\n\nIn 1928 he married Lydia Frutos, a well-known Paraguayan socialite. Lydia was famous for her beauty and also for her high intellectual level, having graduated from educational institutions abroad.\n\nNatalicio was associated with some of the intellectuals of the Colorado Party. His links with people like Juan O'Leary, Fulgencio R. Moreno and Antolín Irala—among others—made possible for him to achieve prominence in the party's organization and propaganda machinery.

His duties allowed him to travel all over South America and meet politicians, writers, and intellectuals from different South American countries.\n\nIn 1923 he moved to Paris, to work with a Paraguayan publishing company. He spent two years in Europe, returning to Paraguay at the end of 1924.\n\nAfter he returned to Asunción, he became more active in the Colorado Party. He reached higher positions in the Party's organization and, by 1926, he was one of the leading party members who negotiatiated for a new electoral law with the ruling Liberals.\n\nUnfortunately for the Colorados, the negotiations with the Liberal government became a source of division within the Colorado Party. The \"abstencionistas\" were reluctant to negotiate anything with the government; they supported abstention from voting to channel popular discontent against the government and bring about a non-violent revolution. The \"eleccionistas\" responded positively to the government's calls for a political ceasefire. Natalicio was one of the main and most dynamic leader of the \"eleccionistas\".\n\nFinally, by 1927, the new electoral law passed and was applied for the first time in the legislative elections held in the beginning of that year. The \"eleccionista\" Colorado Party won some seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, forming a minority bloc. The Colorado senators were mostly former ministers and intellectual leaders during past Colorado governments, while the Deputies included new younger figures, mostly teachers and journalists, who were developing new political idea. Natalicio was the leader of this group, and acted as minority leader during his tenure as Deputy.\n\nHowever, by 1929, Natalicio was not satisfied with the way Paraguayan politics were going. He did not expect the Colorados to get anything at all from participating in electoral politics and the legislature while the Liberals were in power.\n\nIn 1929 Natalicio asked the Chamber of Deputies for permission to leave his post and travel to Europe with his wife.\n\nNatalicio was elected President on 14 February 1948; he was nominated by the Colorados, and was the only candidate. Incumbent President Higinio Morínigo, who had been a \"de facto\" dictator, threatened a \"coup d´état\" to retain power. and was himself deposed by a \"coup\" on 3 June. Juan Manuel Frutos became interim president until Natalicio took office on 15 August.\n\nOne of the most important acts of his administration was the nationalization of the American Light and Traction Company (CALT), which later became the Ande. One of his famous phrases was: \"There will be no red poor\"; this led him to give important and politically powerful positions to\nrepresentatives of all sections of the Colorado Party.\n\nFrom the start of his term, there were rumors that he would not finish his term of office. On 26 October 1948 dissident Colorados attempted a \"coup d'état\" against him. The rebellion was blocked by loyalist forces, but Natalicio could not hold out for long. On 29 January 1949 another \"coup\" broke out, initiated by Felipe Molas López, Federico Chaves, and defense minister General Raimundo Rolón, who controlled the military forces. Natalicio resigned in the early morning of 30 January, and General Rolón took power.\n\nNatalicio González was again driven into exile. On 7 February 1949 he went to Buenos Aires. In 1950 he went to Mexico. He was the last intellectual to hold the presidency of the Republic in the twentieth century.\n\nNatalicio died in Mexico on 6 December 1966, of a heart attack. He had been invited back to Paraguay and was to leave that very day. His wife Lydia committed suicide after finding his body. (She swallowed painkillers and cut her wrists.)\n\n"}

In 1867, Gordon became the Klan's first Grand Dragon for the Realm of Tennessee, and wrote its \"Precept,\" a book describing its organization, purpose, and principles. He was also a member of the United States House of Representatives for the 10th congressional district of Tennessee.\n\nGordon was born on October 5, 1836 in Pulaski, Tennessee. His father was Andrew Gordon and his mother, Eliza K. Gordon. He grew up in Mississippi and Texas. Gordon graduated from the Western Military Institute in Nashville, Tennessee in 1859. He worked on the Nashville & Northwestern Railway.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, Gordon enlisted in the military service of the Confederacy and became drillmaster of the 11th Regiment, Tennessee Infantry. In November 1862 he became the regiments colonel. Gordon was promoted to brigadier general in August 1864, and was one of the youngest Confederate generals. Gordon led Vaughn's Brigade, in Maj. Gen. John C. Brown's division, at the Battle of Franklin (November 30, 1864), where he was wounded and captured. Many of the men he led are buried at McGavock Confederate Cemetery in Franklin, Tennessee.

He was appointed one of the railroad commissioners of Tennessee. He received an appointment in the Department of the Interior in 1885, as special Indian agent in Arizona and Nevada, and he served until 1889. He returned to Memphis, Tennessee and resumed the practice of law. He was the superintendent of Memphis city schools between 1889 and 1907.\n\nThe KKK (the Klan) was formed by veterans of the Confederate Army in Pulaski, Tennessee, in 1866 and soon expanded throughout the state and beyond. Gordon was an early initiate and likely wrote the organization's original \"Prescript\" in 1867 and its revised edition the following year. Following Gordon's death, his widow, Minnie, claimed that he had been the original Grand Wizard of the Klan and that it was he, not Nathan Bedford Forrest, who disbanded it.\n\nGordon was elected as a Democrat to the Sixtieth, Sixty-first, and Sixty-second Congresses.

The party, then in the opposition, split in 1927, facing a proposal of the Liberal government, headed by president Eligio Ayala. Ayala wanted the Colorados to participate in the drafting of a new electoral law. It was his intention to make sure that both parties should participate in the upcoming election for the congress. This caused a split in the Colorado Party amongst the \"eleccionistas\" (electionists), who accepted the offer, and the \"abstencionistas\" (abstentionists), who wanted a stronger and radical opposition against the government. Molas joined to the last group and became a close aide to their leader, former president Pedro P. Peña.\n\nOn February 21, 1936, he assumed as the Mayor of Asuncion for a short period. His brilliant talents of scientific and public man became the leading figure in the national political scene, far complex and anarchic. In 1948 he participated in the ministry of Education in the fleeting mandate of the president Juan Manuel Frutos and then in the mandate of Juan Natalicio González.\nWith the assumption of the chairmanship of General Raimundo Rolón, Molas Lopez retained his ministry until January 30, 1949. \nAs the country was subjected to a one-party regime, February 15 of the same year, by decision of the Board of Colorado Party, gathered in Convention he got the possibility for the implementation of the Statute of Party and the appointment of Dr. Felipe Molas López as a candidate for president.

The political agreement was not a greater guaranteed for the ruler, who was deposed six months later, on September 11. \nA few days later, the Board acknowledged the causes for the President's overthrow. He was accused of having failed to fulfill the targets set as the unification of the party, the progressive restoration of republican institutions, also of public morality. \nAs it was assumed, the president had to overcome a series of political and military upheavals, over the constant pressure of the leaders of his party because, as well as the writer Raul Amaral says \"the Governing Board had control over the state and those responsible for ruling it.”\n\n\nAmong the rulings in his government recalls the following: \n\nThe unification of the Colorado party had not been brought to a successful conclusion.

He obtained his \"attatoui\" diploma (the equivalent of the \"baccalauréat\") in 1928. In 1930, he obtained a law diploma from the University of Ez-Zitouna. The same year, he married and subsequently had two sons, Mohamed Sadok, who became a colonel in the Tunisian army, and Jelal, who later became an engineer.\n\nHe was very interested in modern literature in particular, and translated romantic literature, as well as old Arab literature. His poetic talent manifested itself at an early age and this poetry covered numerous topics, from the description of nature to patriotism. His poems appeared in the most prestigious Tunisian and Middle-Eastern reviews. His poem \"To the tyrants of the world\" became a popular slogan chant during the 2011 Tunisian and subsequently Egyptian demonstrations.\n\nEchebbi died on 9 October 1934 at the Habib-Thameur Hospital in Tunis, Tunisia following a long history of cardiac disorders.

{"id": "2242752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242752", "title": "Madam &amp; Eve", "text": "Madam &amp; Eve\n\nMadam & Eve is a daily comic strip originating in South Africa. The strip, by Stephen Francis and Rico Schacherl, is syndicated in 13 publications and claims a daily readership of over 4 million people. The strip was first published in July 1992, in a black and white weekly format in \"The Weekly Mail\" (now the \"Mail & Guardian\") and in a monthly colour format in \"Living\" magazine. In 1993 the creators added five daily cartoons, also in black and white. In 2000 \"Madam & Eve\" was made into a television sitcom.\n\nA satirical strip, it started in 1992 and was based around the theme of a middle-class white woman, Gwen Anderson (\"Madam\"), and her black maid, Eve Sisulu, coming to terms with the new South Africa as the Apartheid era drew to a close. Theirs is a relationship of affectionate squabbling.\n\nPerhaps in the spirit of equality, neither character is portrayed as particularly sympathetic. Madam is always coming up with silly ideas in order to fit in more with the new way of life. Eve meanwhile keeps coming up with ways of obtaining extra cash out of Madam and others.\n\nThe strip often pokes fun at political figures, both South African and elsewhere in the world (much in the same way, though not as consistently, as the US strip Doonesbury). Past targets have included former South African president Thabo Mbeki, former South African President of South Africa Jacob Zuma, businessman Schabir Shaik and Winnie Mandela. Further afield, jabs have been directed at US President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Pop star Michael Jackson and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nEven Nelson Mandela has been a source of fun. Although highly regarded both in and out of South Africa, \"Madam and Eve\" has treated him no differently than any other politician. For example, when he and Frederik Willem de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, a series of strips had their lawyers discussing its sharing with Mandela insisting on a 60–40% split on the grounds that he had featured on more magazine covers and Hollywood movies.\n\nThe idea for Madam & Eve originated with Stephen Francis, an American expatriate. The three founding creators of the Madam & Eve strip, Harry Dugmore, Rico Schacherl, and Stephen Francis, first worked together on Laughing Stock, a satirical magazine launched in Johannesburg in 1988. Following the closure of the magazine (after 13 issues), the three worked on other projects in the greeting card division of the same company. That company folded, and the trio launched \"Madam & Eve\" in July 1992. Dugmore left the partnership in 2001.\n\nKnown professionally by his first name, Rico is a cartoonist and illustrator living and working in Johannesburg, South Africa. Born in Austria in 1966, he claims he was drawing cartoons ever since he was old enough to hold a pencil. After less-than-successful studies in graphic design and architecture during the late 80s, Rico decided to get a real job as a cartoonist. Besides his work on Madam & Eve, Rico also produces illustrations in a wide variety of styles ranging from serious editorial or humorous magazine illustrations to children's comics.\n\nRico specialises in the fields of corporate communications, graphic storytelling and character design for cartoons, animation and education. He has worked on highly successful projects for clients such as Telkom, Old Mutual, Avmin, Pick 'n Pay, SABC Education and the Human Rights Commission. This work includes The Bottom Line, a cartoon strip about the South African workplace, which is widely syndicated in company newsletters. He has also worked for the Mail & Guardian, Tribute, The Teacher, Style Magazine and Penguin Books.\n\nStephen Francis, born in the US in 1949, moved to South Africa in 1988 with his then wife, Wendy, whom he met at the South African consulate in New York City. His parents live in New Jersey. The fifth anniversary Madam & Eve book credits many of the strip's original ideas, including the title, to Francis.\n\nHarry Dugmore, born 1961, was the native South African of the founding group. Harry was described in 2000 as handling all of the business for the partnership. He left Rapid Phase in 2001.\n\nGwen Anderson, also known as Madam, is a typical white South African woman. The original \"Madam\" is loosely based on Stephen Francis' own mother-in-law, also named Gwen. Of her family we have met one son, Eric, and her mother and aunt.\n\nEve Sisulu is Madam's \"domestic maintenance assistant.\" Eve frequently opens a booth selling different goods and services for a side income, and is sometimes found asleep on her ironing board, both deliberate homages to Charles Schulz' Peanuts (Lucy and Snoopy, respectively). When Schulz died, a tribute cartoon appeared showing Eve sleeping on a kennel and Snoopy sleeping on an ironing board.\n\nThe character of Mother Anderson was originally introduced as Abigail (\"Mother\") Anderson in 1993. The character visited Madam & Eve on a trip from England, and soon disappeared again from the comic strip. Her first appearance was so popular that the character returned in 1994 and has stayed in the comic since, as a permanent character. A twin sister, Edith, was introduced in 1995, but a year after that character's appearance \"Mother Anderson\" became known as \"Edith Anderson,\" the name which has stuck since. She is well known for her addiction to gin and tonic. She is often referred to as \"Gogo\" (a South African affectionate term for an older woman) in more recent strips.\n\nThandi was introduced in 1994 as Lizeka's baby sister. She has often been \"paired\" with 80-year-old Mother Anderson. Since Eric and Lizeka no longer appear regularly, Thandi is described, as of 2005, as \"Eve's precocious cousin who lives next door.\"\n\nEric Anderson, Gwen's son, was introduced in early 1993 as a college student. The character was allowed to graduate from college a few years later, but remained unemployed. When the character reappears it has been said he had been on a trip to India or Tibet.\nThe illustrator's (real name: Enrico Schacherl) real-life brother's name also happens to be Erich.\n\nLizeka was introduced as Eric's college girlfriend in late 1993. Being Zulu, she allowed the writers to explore humour in having an \"interracial couple.\" \nAs of 2005, this character has all but disappeared from the strip.\n\nAnother inspiration of Stephen Francis: Francis would be frequently awoken from naps by a woman street vendor, calling out that she had Mielies (known as ears of corn in the USA & Canada, and maize elsewhere). The writers originally spelled the word \"mealies,\" but settled on \"mielies\" by 1996. The woman who peddles them past Madam & Eve's house is often paired with Mother Anderson, who often gives chase, wielding a \"kattie\" (catapult) for having had her nap interrupted.\n\nMadam's recurring psychiatrist who appeared as a replacement for the old doctor. When he first appeared she thought he was a witchdoctor.\n\nThe parktown prawn is a large King cricket that manages to create regular havoc in Madam's household whenever it appears, due to its repugnant shape and difficulty to kill using normal insecticides.\n\nThe prawns in the cartoon behave like university students who are on holiday – insecticide gives them a drug-trip, and they call it 'zol' – the South African slang for cannabis.\n\nThe Prawns have been known to leave a prawn-shaped silhouette in frying pans applied to them to kill them, and to get amusement from scaring the ladies in the Anderson house.\n\nThree enigmatic laborers sitting on the back of a bakkie (pickup truck) often appear in strips which have Madam stuck in traffic.

It was the childhood home of First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, and the site of the reception for her 1953 wedding to U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy. During his presidency, it was referred to as the \"Summer White House\".\n\nHammersmith Farm's 28-room main house was built in 1887 for John W. Auchincloss, the great-grandfather of Hugh D. Auchincloss (1897–1976), Jacqueline Kennedy's stepfather. It was erected on what had been originally known as \"Hammersmith Island,\" possibly named after the English hometown of William Brenton, the 17th-century governor of Rhode Island who established the first farm on the site in 1640.\n\nDuring a stay at Hammersmith in late September 1961, President Kennedy announced that John McCone would become the new Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Additionally, Kennedy signed Public Law 87-293, the Peace Corps Act of 1961.\nThe main house remained in the Auchincloss family until the 1976 death of Hugh Auchincloss. Janet Lee Auchincloss (1907–1989), Jacqueline Kennedy's mother, sold the main house and moved into one of the guesthouses on the farm, called \"The Castle\". There was another guest house on the farm built to resemble a windmill. A group of investors bought main house in 1977, and opened it for public tours and special events. Fruit of the Loom executive William F. Farley bought it in 1997 for $6.675 million.\n\nIn 1999, Farley sold the main house for over $8 million, the new owner restored the failing building and converted the house back to private use. It had not been lived in since 1974 (over 25 years), and had fallen into serious disrepair.\n\nMuch of the original plumbing was inoperable, and old electrical wiring had frayed from time and rodent damage. Bricks were coming loose and wood rot was everywhere. metal fixtures were rusted or corroded due to the salt air. Each year the building was listing a little more northward, toward Fort Adams. A major restoration was required to save the damaged structure. Major structural flaws necessitated the removal of one end of the building and the installation of steel and wooden beams for support. The house had suffered from decades of wood rot and mold from leaking windows. Outside, the brick was bowing due to many successive winters of freezing and expansion. Popping and falling bricks during the winter was routine. The interiors were painstakingly disassembled and numbered and new plumbing, HVAC, and wiring were installed. Later, the numbered moldings and fixtures were replaced or replicated if needed, in their original positions so the historic rooms looked exactly as they had when the building was constructed in 1887, save for the electricity and modern plumbing.\n\nThe exterior was restored with equal sensitivity to the original structure. Working with Gubelman and the Historic District Commission, the team removed metal and plexiglass porches, reset brick to match the original, and removed the light green paint used to hide the mismatched brick from decades of repairs. Windows were rebuilt to protect the house from the fierce winter winds from the Atlantic Ocean. New shingles and roof were installed following the original architectural plans, and using the many sketches and photographs taken of the building over its 120-year history. Fortunately, the building had been photographed from numerous angles and vantage points over the many decades, and a clear visual history existed as a guide with the goal to restore the farm as closely as possible to the appearance one might have enjoyed in 1888.\n\nAround half of the original furnishings were returned to the Auchincloss family under a prior agreement, and the family sold them off in a Christie's auction in 2000, which fetched $233,620.\n\n\n"}

A long intake length at low rpm provides a better pulse tune because the pulse won't travel back and forth as many times, which aids low-end torque because the high pressure pulse may otherwise contribute to reversion and thereby decreased volumetric efficiency. At higher engine rpm, the intake length is reduced. The result is a flatter torque curve, with more torque available at low- and mid-range engine speeds compared to a similar non-VarioRam engine.\n"}

James defined the specious present to be \"the prototype of all conceived times... the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible\". C. D.

She was a developmental psychologist who developed a theory of personality which emphasized the gradual internalization of social rules and the maturing conscience for the origin of personal decisions. She also contributed to the theory of measurements by introducing the coefficient of test homogeneity. In the tradition of developmental stage models, Loevinger integrated several \"frameworks of meaning-making\" into a model of humans' constructive potentials that she called ego development (\"\"). The essence of the ego is the striving to master, to integrate, and make sense of experience. She also is credited with the creation of an assessment test, the Washington University Sentence Completion Test.\n\nAs a child, Loevinger showed proficiency among her classmates, often achieving far above the rest. She went to the University of Minnesota in hopes of pursuing Psychology, where she was told that this major was too mathematical for her. Despite the odds, Loevinger declared her major as Psychology and managed to graduate magna cum laude at the young age of 19 years old. She then went on to earn her master of science degree in psychometrics at the age of 21.

It was composed for the film \"A Hard Day's Night\" but was eventually not included. It does appear on the soundtrack album. It was also released as the B-side of the single \"A Hard Day's Night\" in the UK.\n\nMcCartney wrote the song in May 1964 while cruising the Caribbean aboard a yacht called \"Happy Days\" with his then-girlfriend Jane Asher. Music critic Ian MacDonald said, \"The sombre lyric—provoked by the frustrating interruptions of a relationship between two career people—matches the lowering gloom of the music.\"\n\nThe song is one of three main compositions (along with \"And I Love Her\" and \"Can't Buy Me Love\") that Paul McCartney wrote for the film. Recorded in advance of film production for lip-synching reasons, \"Things We Said Today\" has a reverse nostalgia premise. McCartney said, \"I wrote this on acoustic. It was a slightly nostalgic thing already, a future nostalgia. We’ll remember the things we said today, sometime in the future, so the song projects itself into the future.\"\n\nMcCartney was particularly satisfied with his chord change, F major to B flat major—instead of the more obvious F minor—which first occurs beneath \"…wishing you weren't so \"far\" away\" in the song. John Lennon accentuates the strident acoustic guitar strumming by triple hitting a low A note on a piano. The dynamic of the song moves from melancholy to rock and back with a minor to major key change during its middle eight section.\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"Things We Said Today\" in three takes on 2 June 1964. Take one was a false start, take two was the rhythm track, and take three was used for overdubs of the main vocal, tambourine, and piano. According to author and Beatle historian Mark Lewisohn, the piano was supposed to be omitted from the mix but is audible owing to leakage onto other microphones during the recording of the overdubs, but MacDonald was sceptical about that conclusion.\n\nThe group also recorded \"Things We Said Today\" twice for BBC Radio, on 14 and 17 July 1964. The first, a performance for the \"Top Gear\" radio show, was featured on the \"Live at the BBC\" album in 1994. These performances took place around the same time as the theatrical release of the Beatles' film \"A Hard Day's Night\", and on the 14 July performance the song was erroneously introduced as \"one of their film songs.\" The song was not in the film, but was included on Side 2, the \"non-soundtrack\" side of the British \"A Hard Day's Night\" album.\n\nThe Beatles included \"Things We Said Today\" as part of their live set during their 1964 tour of the United States and Canada. George Harrison sang harmony vocals alongside Paul McCartney during the performances.\n\n\nJackie DeShannon covered \"Things We Said Today\" in 1978.

The oldest known mole is at Wadi al-Jarf, an ancient Egyptian harbor complex on the Red Sea.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area in California, there were several moles, combined causeways and wooden piers or trestles extending from the eastern shore and utilized by various railroads, such as the Key System, Southern Pacific Railroad (two), and Western Pacific Railroad: the Alameda Mole, the Oakland Mole, and the Western Pacific Mole. By extending the tracks the railroads could get beyond the shallow mud flats and reach the deeper waters of the Bay that could be navigated by the Bay Ferries. A train fell off the Alameda Mole through an open drawbridge in 1890 killing several people. None of the four Bay Area moles survive today, although the causeway portions of each were incorporated into the filling in of large tracts of marshland for harbor and industrial development.\n\nA large mole was completed in 1947 at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood of San Francisco to accommodate the large Hunters Point gantry crane. The mole required of fill.\n\nThe two concrete moles protecting the outer harbour at Dunkirk played a significant part in the evacuation of British and French troops during World War II in May/June 1940. The harbour had been made unusable by German bombing and it was clear that troops were not going to be taken directly off the beaches fast enough. Naval captain W. G. Tennant had been placed ashore to take charge of the navy shore parties and organise the evacuation. Tennant had what proved to be the highly successful idea of using the East Mole to take off troops. The moles had never been designed to dock ships, but despite this, the majority of troops rescued from Dunkirk were taken off in this way. James Campbell Clouston, pier master on the east mole, organised and regulated the flow of men on that site.\n\nThe Churchill Barriers are a series of four causeways in the Orkney Islands with a total length of 1.5 miles (2.4 km). They link the Orkney Mainland in the north to the island of South Ronaldsay via Burray and the two smaller islands of Lamb Holm and Glimps Holm.\n\nThe barriers were built in the 1940s as naval defences to protect the anchorage at Scapa Flow. They were commissioned following the sinking of HMS \"Royal Oak\" in 1939 by German U-boat \"U-47\" which had penetrated the existing defences of sunken blockships and anti-submarine nets. The barriers now serve as road links, carrying the A961 road from Kirkwall to Burwick.\n\nNotable in antiquity was the Heptastadion, a giant mole built in the 3rd century BC in the city of Alexandria, Egypt to join the city to \"Pharos Island\" where the Pharos lighthouse stood. The causeway formed a barrier separating Alexandria's oceanfront into two distinct harbours, an arrangement which had the advantage of protecting the harbours from the force of the strong westerly coastal current. The Heptastadion is also believed to have served as an aqueduct while Pharos was inhabited, and geophysical research indicates that it was part of the road network of the ancient city. Silting over the years resulted in the former dyke disappearing under several metres of accumulated silt and soil upon which the Ottomans built a town from 1517 onwards. Part of the modern city of Alexandria is now built on the site.\n\nWhen England acquired the north African city of Tangier as English Tangier in 1661, the English began building a mole to improve the harbour. The mole was planned to be long and cost £340,000, and the improved harbour was to be long, deep at low tide, and capable of keeping out the roughest of seas. Work began on the mole in August 1663 and continued for some years under a succession of Governors. With an improved harbour the town would have played the same role that Gibraltar later played in British naval strategy.\nHowever, Parliament expressed concern about the cost of maintaining the Tangier garrison, and by 1680 King Charles II had threatened to give up Tangier unless the supplies were voted for its sea defences. A crippling blockade by the Jaysh al-Rifi finally forced the English to withdraw from Tangier in 1683. The King gave secret orders to abandon the city, level the fortifications, destroy the harbour, and evacuate the troops. Samuel Pepys was present at the evacuation and wrote an account of it.\n\nStone quaysides are sometimes called moles. A well-known example is the Molo in Venice. It is the site of the Doge's Palace and two pillars which form a gateway to the sea. It has been depicted numerous times by artists such as Canaletto.\n\n\n"}

It was later released on their third UK album \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964).\n\nOne of Lennon's semi-autobiographical songs, \"You Can't Do That\" \"contradicted the genial tone with its tense threats, sexual paranoia and nagging, dragging groove\", wrote Robert Sandall. The song's theme of jealousy was revisited in other Lennon compositions, such as \"Run for Your Life\" and \"Jealous Guy\". Influenced by the then relatively unknown Wilson Pickett, it is rooted in the twelve-bar blues form, with Lennon introducing a discordant sharp 9th (F) on the D7th chord, pointedly emphasising \"\"…I told you before…\"\" and then pushing this note for the exasperated \"\"Oh!\"\" before resolving to the song's key of G. Lennon also composed and played the guitar solo. The work reflected Lennon's love for hard-edged American R&B—\"a cowbell going four in the bar and the chord going chatoong!\" as he put it.\n\nGeorge Harrison wrote the intro and outro guitar riff in the studio, according to Tom Petty in \"Rolling Stone\". When asked by Petty how he came up with it, Harrison recalled \"I was just standing there [in the studio] and thought, 'I've got to do something!'\".\n\nWith filming due to begin on \"A Hard Day's Night\", film director Richard Lester needed the Beatles to provide him with original material ahead of production; \"You Can't Do That\" was selected to be part of the Scala Theatre \"live performance\" scene in the film, but was dropped from the final cut along with \"I'll Cry Instead\" and \"I Call Your Name\". The recording took nine takes to complete, and was considered for the A-side of their next single until McCartney wrote \"Can't Buy Me Love\".\n\n\"You Can't Do That\" was recorded on Tuesday, 25 February 1964, in EMI Studios in London. An early take with a guide vocal is included on \"Anthology 1\". It was the first song completed in the week before the Beatles began filming \"A Hard Day's Night\", though \"I Should Have Known Better\" and \"And I Love Her\" were also started on the same day.\n\nWhilst in New York for \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", guitarist George Harrison was presented with a Rickenbacker 360 Deluxe electric 12-string guitar worth (in 1964) $900. Only the second one produced, it was recorded for the first time on \"You Can't Do That\" and gave the song its distinctive chiming sound. \n\nThe song was first released as the B-side of the \"Can't Buy Me Love\" single on 16 March 1964 in the United States by Capitol Records and on 20 March 1964 in the United Kingdom by Parlophone. It was the Beatles' seventh US single and sixth UK single. It was later included on the \"A Hard Day's Night\" album in the UK, and \"The Beatles' Second Album\" in the US.\n\nThe Beatles were filmed miming to \"You Can't Do That\" as part of the final concert sequence in the \"A Hard Day's Night\" film. The filming took place on 31 March 1964 at the Scala Theatre in London, but was not used. It was, however, broadcast on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on 24 May. The performance is included in the documentary \"The Making of \"A Hard Day's Night\"\".\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"You Can't Do That\" four times for BBC radio in 1964. It also became a part of the group's live repertoire that year, and was the second song in their set—after \"Twist And Shout\"—during their Australian and North American tours.\n\nAccording to Mark Lewisohn's book \"The Beatles Recording Sessions\", George Martin overdubbed a piano track to Take 9 on 22 May 1964, ostensibly for the album version of this song, but it was never used.\n\n\n\"You Can't Do That\" was covered by Harry Nilsson for his debut album \"Pandemonium Shadow Show\" (1967). Nilsson re-arranged the song making it somewhat slower. He also worked references to 18 other Beatles tunes in the mix, usually by quoting snippets of Beatles lyrics in the multi-layered backing vocals.\n\nThe track was Nilsson's first hit as a performer; though it stalled at #122 on the US charts, it reached the top 10 in Canada. It also (along with the rest of the album) established Nilsson as a favourite performer of the Beatles. Famously, Lennon listened to \"Pandemonium Shadow Show\" for 36 hours straight after being given a copy by Derek Taylor; he then called Nilsson to congratulate him, which started a friendship that would last for the rest of Lennon's life. Later, in a 1968 press conference to announce the formation of Apple Corps, Lennon was asked to name his favourite American artist; he replied, \"Nilsson\". McCartney was then asked to name his favourite American group, and replied likewise, \"Nilsson\".\n\n"}

Johnson co-wrote Chely Wright's 1999 single, \"Single White Female,\" which reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in September 1999. Johnson was signed, in 2000, to record label Arista Nashville.\n\nIn 2001, Johnson released her debut album \"Room with a View.\" The album's first single \"Georgia\" reached No. 4 on the \"RPM\" Canadian Country Singles Chart for the week of November 6, 2000. \"Complicated\" was a Top Ten hit on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Her next single (\"I Don't Want You to Go\") was also a Top Ten hit in the U.S. After a three-year hiatus, Johnson returned with the single \"Let Me Introduce Myself\". It was the lead single from her fourth album, \"Love Rules,\" released in 2010.\n\nCarolyn Dawn Johnson was born in Grande Prairie, Alberta to John Johnson, a farmer and operator of a seed-cleaning business, and Loretta Johnson, a supervisor of a home for senior citizens. Johnson was raised on a farm in Deadwood, Alberta with two brothers, late older brother Derwin, who died due to an undisclosed illness on Christmas Eve in 1998, and brother Greg.\n\nJohnson was passionate about music from a young age and even asked her mother how anyone could live without it. She sang at a church and started playing the piano at the age of five, learning from her pastor's wife, Evangeline Thiessen. Her parents played country music records by Jim Reeves and Don Williams at home and as she got older, her musical interests diversified as she listened to artists like ABBA, Charley Pride, Fleetwood Mac and Marty Stuart among others. The family later moved to Westlock, Alberta and Johnson attended RF Staples High School there. During her high school years, she learned to play the clarinet, flute and saxophone. She kept up her piano lessons largely in part due to Thiessan sending books and encouraging letters to her. Her high school teachers were not as encouraging and caused her to turn away from music for a while and turn to science, a period in her life which she called \"a stain in her heart\".\n\nAfter graduating high school, believing that she could not make a living as a musician, Johnson attended Trinity Western University in Langley, British Columbia studying biology and a year later she was in Edmonton, Alberta studying education. During her college years, she frequently sat-in with local bands at night and encouragement from them caused her to think that maybe she could have a career in the music industry. At the age of 20, she taught herself to play the guitar and realizing that her true calling was in music, she went to Vancouver, British Columbia and there she attended Columbia Academy and learned the technical aspects of the music industry. Johnson focussed on songwriting in her spare time and ordered a video featuring songwriters from Nashville to learn more about songwriting and through this video, she joined the Nashville Songwriters Association International.\nIn 1994, Johnson headed to Nashville after calling her mother and saying, \"I'm going big. I'm going for the big picture.\"\n\nIn Nashville, Johnson attended songwriting workshops and writer's night events. In 1997, Johnson moved permanently to Nashville after obtaining a work visa and later that year, she signed with Patrick Joseph Music as a songwriter. Her songwriting demos captured the attention of many record label executives and some of the songs she wrote were recorded by Patty Loveless, Suzy Bogguss, Kathy Mattea, Mindy McCready, Jo Dee Messina, Linda Davis and Chely Wright. Johnson's breakthrough as a songwriter came in 1999 when \"Single White Female\", a song she co-wrote with Shaye Smith and recorded by Wright, became a number one hit on country radio. This song became Johnson's first number one hit as a songwriter. Another one of her songs, \"Downtime\", recorded by Messina, also became a top five hit. In 2000, Johnson was named \"Breakthrough Songwriter of the Year\" by MusicRow Magazine.\n\nIn 1999, Johnson started her career as a solo artist. Her success as a songwriter led her to a record deal with the Arista Nashville record label. Paul Worley, a producer with whom Johnson was working, was also working with Martina McBride at that time and asked Johnson to sing background vocals on McBride's songs. McBride subsequently invited Johnson to go on tour with her as a backup singer and guitarist. Johnson toured with McBride for over a year and during this time she was also hard at work writing songs for her debut album.\n\nIn 2001, Johnson went on the Girls Night Out Tour opening for high-profile stars Sara Evans, Martina McBride, Reba McEntire and Jamie O'Neal. Later that year, Johnson released her debut album \"Room with a View\" in Canada. She co-wrote all 13 songs and co-produced the album. An American release of the album followed a few months later, though only containing the first 11 songs due to differences in the contracts. The album was well-received as it sold a little less than 18,000 copies in its first week and debuted at No. 8 on the US country sales chart. It became Arista Nashville's highest debuting album by a new artist since SoundScan was used to track record sales. The album went on to be certified gold in Canada in a few months.\n\nThe first two singles from the album, \"Georgia\" and \"Complicated\", were both hits in the United States, with the latter reaching No. 5 on the country charts. The year ended with Johnson receiving a record-breaking 10 nominations from the Canadian Country Music Association, with \"Georgia\" and \"Complicated\" competing against each other for \"Single of the Year\", \"Song of the Year\" and \"Video of the Year\". Johnson went on to win five awards, including her first \"Female Artist of the Year\" award.\n\nJohnson went on tour with Alan Jackson and Kenny Chesney in 2002. Her next single, \"I Don't Want You to Go\", was a top 10 hit in both Canada and the US. Subsequent singles did well on the Canadian charts but not on the American charts. Johnson was nominated for five CCMA awards that year and won three, including her second consecutive \"Female Artist of the Year\". She also won a Juno award for \"Best Country Artist\" and an Academy of Country Music award for \n\"Top New Female Artist\" that year.\n\nIn 2003, Johnson went on her first co-headlining tour with Keith Urban. While on tour, she was once again writing songs, this time for her second album. Urban provided his voice for a song on that album.\n\nIn 2004, Johnson released her second album, \"Dress Rehearsal\", in which she co-produced and wrote 11 of the 12 songs. The album debuted at number nine on Billboard's top country albums charts. The first single from the album, \"Simple Life\", did well on both the Canadian and the American country charts. This was the only song on the album that she did not write. The second single, \"Die of a Broken Heart\", also did well on the Canadian country charts but not on the American charts. Later that year, she received seven CCMA award nominations and won five awards.\n\nJohnson left Arista Nashville in 2005 because \"what they wanted her to do wasn't her.\"\n\n\"Love & Negotiation\", Johnson's 3rd album, was released in Canada under the Angeline Entertainment label in 2006. As with her first album, she wrote all 12 songs, but this time she produced the entire album by herself. The album was originally scheduled to be released in the United States in mid-2007 by Equity Music Group but was delayed and Johnson exited Equity in 2008. In September 2007, Johnson was named Female Vocalist of the Year at the 2007 CCMA Awards. \"Love & Negotiation\" was eventually released in the United States digitally through Dancing Lily Music on October 13, 2009 with different artwork.\n\nIn 2010, Johnson released the first single from her upcoming studio album. The single, \"Let Me Introduce Myself\", is included on her fourth studio album, \"Love Rules\", which was released digitally in the United States on July 21, 2010 and in Canada on August 10, 2010 via Dancing Lily Music. The album is produced by Johnson and Frank Rogers and features 12 new songs. 'Love Rules' was nominated for Country Album of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards \n\nJohnson married Matt Fisher in 2003: they divorced in 2019. They had two children, Abigail, in 2008 and Bennett, in 2010.\n"}

{"id": "2242860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242860", "title": "This Boy", "text": "This Boy\n\n\"This Boy\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by John Lennon (credited to Lennon–McCartney). It was released in November 1963 as the B-side of the band's Parlophone single \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\". In the United States, it was issued in January 1964 on \"Meet the Beatles!\", which was Capitol Records' reconfigured version of the \"With the Beatles\" album. The Beatles performed the song live on 16 February 1964 for their second appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\n\n\"This Boy\" was remastered for compact disc by George Martin and released in 1988 on the \"Past Masters, Volume One\" compilation. On 9 September 2009 it was re-released on the two CD set \"Past Masters\", as part of the remastering of the original Beatles' catalogue, and was included in \"The Beatles Stereo Box Set\" and in \"The Beatles in Mono\" box set.\n\nIts composition was an attempt by Lennon at writing a song in the style of Motown star Smokey Robinson, and specifically his song \"I've Been Good To You\", which has similar circular doo-wop chord changes, melody and arrangement. The tune and arrangement also draws from \"You Don't Understand Me\", a B-side to a Bobby Freeman single. Paul McCartney cites the Teddy Bears' 1958 hit \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" as also being influential. Lennon, McCartney, and George Harrison join together to sing an intricate three-part close harmony in the verses and refrain and a similar technique is employed in later Beatles songs, notably \"Yes It Is\" and \"Because\". Originally the middle eight was conceived as a guitar solo but altered during the recording process. Written in D major, the song revolves around a 1950s-style I-vi-ii-V doo-wop sequence in 12/8 time before moving to the harmonically complex middle eight (G-F#7-Bm-D7-G-E7-A-A7) and back again for the final verse and fade-out. William Mann describes the song as, \"harmonically...one of their most intriguing, with its chains of pandiatonic clusters\".\n\nAn instrumental version of \"This Boy\", orchestrated by George Martin, is used as the incidental music during Ringo Starr's towpath scene in the film \"A Hard Day's Night\". The piece, under the title, \"Ringo's Theme (This Boy)\" was released as a single—but failed to chart in the UK—on 7 August 1964 with \"And I Love Her\" on the A-Side, although it did reach number 53 in the American Top 100 later that year. It was also included on Martin’s Parlophone album \"Off the Beatle Track\" and the EP \"Music From A Hard Day’s Night\" by the George Martin Orchestra, released 19 February 1965. It was also included on the American \"A Hard Day's Night\" soundtrack album. Jimmy Page’s backing guitar work can be heard on \"Ringo’s Theme\", which plays as the Beatles drummer wanders around London on his own.\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"This Boy\" on 17 October 1963. On the same day they recorded \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\"; the group's first fan club Christmas single, and a version of \"You Really Got A Hold On Me\".\n\nThey recorded fifteen takes of \"This Boy\" followed by two overdubs. The song was recorded with a rounded ending, although it was faded out during a mixing session on 21 October. Two takes were joined together to make the final master, with the edit between the middle eight and final verse (1:28).\n\nAlternative recordings have also been officially released. A live version performed on \"Two of a Kind\" in 1963 was released on \"Anthology 1\" and two incomplete takes from the original recording were released as a track on the single \"Free as a Bird\".\n\nRobson & Jerome covered the song on their self-titled 1995 album; by a remarkable coincidence, this was number one on the UK Albums Chart in the same week the Beatles' \"Anthology 1\", which features a version of the song, peaked at number two.\n\nThe Smithereens covered the song on their 2007 album \"Meet The Smithereens!\"\n\nAlgernon Cadwallader covered the song on \"Cover UpA Covers Compilation\" (2011)\n\nThe Nylons performed an \"a cappella\" cover of the song on their 1986 release \"Seamless.\"\n\n"}

It enjoys a scenic location close to mountains, lakes, forests and national parks. It is located from the city of Puerto Montt on the shore of Llanquihue Lake, the second largest lake in Chile. The conical Osorno Volcano and the snowcapped peaks of Mt. Calbuco and Mt. Tronador are clearly visible from the lakefront. Puerto Varas is the southernmost of a string of towns on the western shore of Llanquihue Lake that includes Frutillar, Llanquihue and Puerto Octay. It spans an area of .\n\nThe original of the city of Puerto Varas date to 1853 and is named after Antonio Varas, the Minister of the Interior at the time. It was founded by German immigrants who settled the shores of Lake Llanquihue as part of a government colonization project during the presidency of Manuel Montt. \n\nThe area known as the \"Llanquihue Lake Colonization Territory\" was created by the government on 27 June 1853, and by the end of 1853, the first 212 German families had immigrated to what would be Puerto Varas.\n\nThe first area to be settled was known as La Fabrica, where the road from Puerto Montt and the coast reached Llanquihue Lake. Other landmarks in its early history include the opening of a Catholic church in 1872 and the founding of the Deutscher Verein (\"German Club\") in 1885. The town received official status in the form of a Título de Villa (\"Town Certification\") in 1897. The commune of Puerto Varas, as it exists today, was formed in December 1925, when the Ministry of the Interior divided the country into provinces, and communes.\n\nAccording to population projections from Chile’s National Statistics Institute, in 2012 the commune of Puerto Varas had 41,255 inhabitants (21,093 men and 20,162 women). The population had increased by 25% since the 2002 census.\n\nPuerto Varas is characterized by traditional German architecture, with houses built from \"alerce\" wood using tools brought over from Europe by the 19th century colonial inhabitants. It was designated a Zona Típica (heritage zone) in 1992 and has a number of protected buildings, including the Iglesia del Sagrado Corazón de Jesus (Sacred Heart of Jesus Church). Built in 1918 on one of the highest points in Puerto Varas, the wooden church is one of the city’s iconic landmarks. Other notable protected structures include Casa Kuschel (1915) and Casa Yunge (1932).\n\nCultural institutions in Puerto Varas include the Antonio Felmer Museum, the Molino Machmar Art Centre, the Nativo Bosque Gallery and the Pablo Fierro Museum. Nearby Frutillar hosts the annual Frutillar Musical Weeks in January and February.\n\nPuerto Varas is known for traditional German dishes, especially Kuchen, which is celebrated on the annual Kuchen Day on the first Saturday of February. Craft beers, pastries, cakes, chocolate and marmalades can also be found in the town’s shops, restaurants and cafes.\n\nPuerto Varas is a popular tourist destination with its distinctive German-inspired architecture, wide variety of hotels and inns, a casino, a beach and striking views over the lake to the Osorno and Calbuco volcanoes. \n\nVisitors can take part in a range of outdoor sports including kayaking, fishing and trekking, and there is a winter ski centre on the slopes of Osorno Volcano. It is a good base for excursions to nearby natural landmarks including the emerald Todos los Santos Lake, the picturesque Petrohué Falls (Spanish: Saltos de Petrohué), Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park and Puyehue National Park as well as Osorno Volcano. Trips are also possible to other towns around Llanquihue Lake including Frutillar, Puerto Octay and Llanquihue.\n\nPuerto Varas is the starting point for bus-and-boat crossings of the Andes, through spectacular forested mountains reflected in shimmering lakes, to San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina. The trip is best made west to east with an overnight at a hotel in the midst of the wilderness.\n\nInternational schools\n\nConveniently nearby, El Tepual International Airport for Puerto Montt is served by many daily non-stop flights from Santiago, as well as numerous flights from other cities. More than 1,100,000 passengers a year use the airport.\n\nAs a commune, Puerto Varas is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2012–2016 alcalde is Álvaro Berger Schmidt (PS).\n\nWithin the electoral divisions of Chile, Puerto Varas is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Fidel Espinoza (PS) and Felipe DeMussy Hiriart (UDI). It is part of the 56th electoral district, together with Puyehue, Río Negro, Purranque, Puerto Octay, Fresia, Frutillar, Llanquihue and Los Muermos. The commune is represented in the Senate by Rabindranath Quinteros (PS) and Iván Moreira (UDI) as part of the 17th senatorial constituency (Los Lagos Region).\n\nPuerto Varas has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\", according to the Köppen climate classification), with an average annual precipitation of . Summers are mild and winters are rainy and somewhat chilly.\n\n"}
{"id": "2242905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242905", "title": "Reliant Regal", "text": "Reliant Regal\n\nThe Reliant Regal was a small three-wheeled car and van manufactured from 1953 to 1973 by the Reliant Motor Company in Tamworth, England, replacing the earlier Reliant Regent three-wheeled cyclecar van. As a three-wheeled vehicle having a lightweight (under 7 cwt, 355.6 kg) construction, under UK law it is considered a \"tricycle\" and can be driven on a full (class A) motorcycle licence. A light-commercial version with a side-hinged rear door was marketed as the Reliant Supervan.\n\nFollowing the launch of the Mk I in 1953, the Regal passed through many revisions in a short period, with the \"first generation\" using the original wooden frame and discrete-panel bodywork design through to the 1961 Mk VI.\n\nIn 1962, Reliant introduced the Mk VII,\ncode named \"TW7\" (Three Wheeler 7). This version featured a new OHV Reliant engine, a new steel chassis and bonded shell design for the body, fully updated visual styling, and was badged as the Regal 3/25, Regal 3/30 (number of wheels/bhp), Regal 21E or Regal 21E 700. The 600cc engine produced 25 bhp (actually 598cc/24 bhp) and the 700cc engine produced 30 bhp (actually 701cc / 29 bhp). The 21E version was fitted with 21 extras, which were otherwise available as optional extras to the standard car. These extras included a spot light, a fog light, chrome plated bumper over-riders, sun visors, an oil gauge, outer wheel trims and metallic paint. In 1973, the Regal was replaced by the Reliant Robin (code named \"TW8\").\n\nRegals MkI–MkII had aluminium bodies and 747cc side-valve engines. However, during the 1950s, the price of aluminium increased markedly across Europe. In response, Reliant developed an expertise in making panels of glass fibre which piece by piece replaced the aluminium panels, until the 1956 Mark 3 Regal featured a wholly glass fibre body.\nUnlike Panhard, who responded to the increased cost of aluminium by substituting heavier steel panels, Reliant's choice of the glass fibre technology ensured that the Regal was able to retain its advantageous light weight, with the resulting ability to use smaller, lower powered and therefore cheaper and more economical engines. The Regal Mk VI was the last Regal to be powered by a side-valve engine, as by 1962 Reliant had developed their own all aluminium 600 cc OHV engine that was fitted into the new Regal 3/25.\n\nThe Regal 3/25 version was introduced in October 1962 and unlike previous Regals, this no longer had a wooden frame and instead had a unitary construction body of reinforced fibreglass. Fibreglass was moulded in two major units (outer and inner) and then bonded together and bolted to a steel chassis. Meanwhile, on 25 April 1968, a year before BMC celebrated their 2,000,000th Mini Reliant sales director T.H.Scott personally drove the 50,000th Regal 3/25 off the assembly line at Reliant's Tamworth plant.\n\nA few months later, in August 1968, the 701 cc engine introduced in the Reliant Rebel the previous autumn found its way into the Regal.\nFor the three-wheeler, the compression ratio was lowered to 7.5:1, reducing the power to a claimed 29.5 bhp from the Rebel's 35 bhp. Nevertheless, this still represented a useful increase over the 26 bhp claimed for the 600 cc unit which the 701 replaced.\n\nReliant Regals and Robins enjoy something of a special place in British culture as symbols of British eccentricity.\n\nAn example of a Supervan III is the iconic yellow van belonging to Del Boy and Rodney Trotter in the long-running BBC sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\". Many people claim to own genuine screen used vans but very few have any proof, British boxer Ricky Hatton bought a replica Del Boy van in 2004 which the seller claimed was genuine but later proved false. Another van sold for around £44,000 in 2017 to an anonymous buyer which was on display for 10 years in the Cars Of the Stars museum and was used in the \"Batman and Robin\" Christmas special. It sold along with a very good replica of an Adam West era Batmobile.\n\nThere were several Reliant Regal vans used in filming; For Series 1 and most of Series 2 (up to and including A Touch Of Glass) a 1969 Reliant Regal Supervan II was used - distinguished by its number plate APL 911H and much 'dirtier' appearance, with an off-white colour bonnet, stickers to the rear door and distinctive paint pattern to the front. After A Touch Of Glass a new van was sourced and can be seen in the Series 2 Christmas special 'Diamonds Are For Heather'. This van remained in use until after Series 3 where others were then used. All other Reliants used in the TV series were the 1972 or 1973 Regal Supervan III, dated by the type tail lights fitted. The fins of last Regals were remodelled to be flatter to incorporate the flat topped bulky tail lamps. All previous Regals used round topped flush tail lights (Lucas L572). Action Cars, Telefilm Cars and Cars of the Stars in Keswick England would hire vans for filming over the course of the TV shows life.\n\nThe registration number of DHV 938D wasn't real and is just a show plate made for production. \n\nIn another TV comedy, \"Mr. Bean\", a running gag involves the titular character played by British comedian Rowan Atkinson frequently coming into conflict with a light blue 1972 Reliant Regal Supervan III, which gets tipped over, crashed into, or bumped out of its parking space. Two vans were used, the early van used in filming is easy to identify as its light blue, has 2 chrome wing mounted mirrors and has the earlier chrome rear lights, it also has rear windows which have been simply painted over.\nThe 2nd van which seems to have only been used in the Tee Off, Mr. Bean episode is painted a much darker blue, has no wing mirrors of any kind, the larger late rear lights and also has rear windows which have been painted over, the inside of the doors have also been painted black.\n\nA red Supervan appeared in the S4C Welsh language children's programme \"Fan Goch\".\n\nThe 2011 Disney film \"Cars 2\" features a French character named Tomber who is patterned on a Reliant Regal saloon car, with some creative modifications, such as the headlights of a Citroën Ami. His name means \"to fall\" in French, referring to the reputed instability of three-wheel vehicles.\n\nA Reliant Regal is shown in the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics with it falling apart and Batman and Robin coming out of it, a plot that appeared in an episode of \"Only Fools and Horses\".\n\nThe \"Only Fools and Horses\" Reliant Regal appeared in cartoon form in a short Discovery Channel advert. The cartoon man was driving a sports car and after a short drive it turned into the Supervan with the announcer saying \"What a plonker\", albeit quietly, as a reference to Del Boy's famous saying.\n\nIn the 2016 Microsoft racing game \"Forza Horizon 3\" which is set in Australia, the 1972 Reliant Supervan III was added to the vehicle roster. The car was again featured in Forza Horizon 4, this time set in England.\n\n"}
